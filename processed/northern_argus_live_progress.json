    "original_text": "Copper Interpretation Centre\nRumours say that the Copper Interpretation Centre, which was the major component of the Jubilee 150 Burra heritage Town Project, is dead.  The project was announced by the Premier in May 1983 as one of three major Jubilee 150 projects – the others being the Port Adelaide Maritime Museum and the restoration of Fort Glanville.  All were to be funded by a $2 million grant from the Commonwealth Government and Burra’s share was to be $470,000.\nFrom the start controversy has dogged Burra’s plans to have a Copper Interpretation centre – a concept of Ian Auhl and adopted by the Burra Burra DC.  The Heritage Conservation Branch requested the Department of Environment and Planning to conduct a feasibility study and that favoured spending the major part of the allocation on a selection of heritage projects instead of just on the Copper Interpretation Centre.  The Burra Burra DC voted unanimously to go on with the original concept.\nThe steering Committee was chaired by Barry Rowney of the Heritage Conservation Branch, who became the working party chairman.  There were representatives from the Heritage Conservation Unit., the History Trust of SA, the Department of Tourism, the Department of Mines and Energy, the Burra Burra DC and Burra National Trust.\nThe Burra Burra DC had some years earlier purchased the Salvation Army Citadel with the idea of its being developed as the Copper Interpretation Centre.  An officer from the Heritage Conservation Branch deemed this to be unsuitable because of its ‘social atmosphere’ and geographic location.  Other sites then considered were:\nA new building at the Bon Accord Mine site.\nA new building adjacent to Peacock’s Chimney.\nA new building on the plateau on the eastern side of the Mine Pool.\nA new building where Morphett’s Pumphouse boiler house stood.\nDesigns were drawn up and the first completed were costed at about twice the available funds.  Amended designs cut the building virtually in half, gave minimal space to administration, but retained an adequate gallery area and the plateau site was chosen.  The working party approved this and Barry Rowney of the Heritage Conservation Branch indicated verbally that the Branch would recommend approval.\nTenders were called and the lowest received was about 100% over the estimated cost.  The working party immediately moved to vary the proposal slightly and move it to the boiler house site with a building the same size and similar silhouette to the former boiler house.  Two architects have indicated their interest and belief that this building could be achieved within budget and could be completed by the target date of October 1986.\nRumours of the scuttling of the whole project and for the reallocation of the funds elsewhere have been circulating for two weeks.  The Burra Burra DC has sought urgent answers from the Premier.  The Department of Mines and Energy has been so supportive of the idea that it has already contributed $25,000 to be concentrated on Morphett’s Pumphouse and surrounds.  Burra’s Tourist Officer Jenny O’Connor has joined the Council in lobbying fiercely for the project and to counter the claim that Burra has been slow to react - though no meetings were held between January 1984 and November 1984 and then only at the insistence of the Burra Burra Dc Chairman James Hawker.  The allegation that there is now insufficient time to complete the project is denied by the architects.  Of concern id the allegation that the Heritage Conservation Branch, which has been closely associated with the project, will not now approve building on the boiler house site.  It has been alleged that the head of the Heritage Conservation Branch, Jon Womersley, when asked if his Department had any alternatives to offer, said, ‘No’.",

The Copper Interpretation Centre was intended to interpret SA’s copper mining and place SA’s copper mining towns in a world perspective.  Burra was recognised as the appropriate place for this by the Board of Jubilee 150 and as a result of a concept by R.J. Noye of Clare and lobbying by myself and the Burra Burra DC a grant of $270,000 was made to establish the Copper Interpretation Centre.  The Centre would give SA a genuine historic town to show visitors - SA’s counterpart at Maldon in Victoria – and not to Swan Hill or Sovereign Hill.  Burra is the genuine article.  ‘Surely Burra will protest en masse to having its money, honestly obtained, dishonestly sidetracked to some other project.’",

A feature of the building is its façade in bluestone taken from the old Farmers’ Union building that was on the same site.  It and the bullnosed verandah are both in keeping with Burra’s heritage.  Branch manager Andrew Butler said the new premises would be an asset to the rural community in Burra and district.  It would offer a bigger and better showroom and improved product display.  John Secomb, the Dalgety Bennetts Farmers’ northern regional manager, said that when he started in Burra with Oates Ltd in 1960 there were five stock agents in town.  Today there were two.

The weekend also marked the 75th birthday of the Mt Bryan Soldiers’ Memorial Hall.  On Saturday afternoon there were displays by the Yankalilla Light Horse, sheep dog displays and hayrides.  Tim Butler of Radio 5CK compered the ball that night in the Soldiers’ Memorial Hall.  Many attended in period costume.  Ralph Oakley won the beard growing contest for those who started clean shaven on 3 August.  Dave Parnell won the longest beard of all prize.  Sunday’s combined church service was conducted by former resident Fr Laurie Quinn assisted by Fr Richard Morris, Rev. Malcolm Thomas and Fr Eugene Kelly.  The United Light Brass Band supplied the music.  A community lunch was followed by a Pleasant Sunday Afternoon compered by Marlene Richards of Hallett.",

    "original_text": "A petition with 570 signatures has called for a halt to any further installation of electricity poles in Market Square and for postponement of redevelopment work until an artist’s impression has been published in the press and a public meeting held to discuss proposals.\n\nThe petition was organised by Burra National Trust and presented to Council by its President Mrs Maureen Wright.  For some years the Council has had plans to underground the electricity, improve traffic flow and redesign parking.  Although plans have been publicised they did not clearly show the position and design of the new lightin poles.  The type of light pole has created concern.  The standard goose-neck poles were deemed unsuitable for a heritage town and their position on proposed protuberances has also roused concern.  In presenting the petition Mrs Wright spoke about Burra as a Heritage Town and urged the Council to reconsider the pole choice.  Mr John Modra of the Highways Department spoke outlining the accepted standards and stressed that the safety factor.  The funding arrangements were also outlined.  Council accepted the petition and will discuss the situation at its executive meeting early this week.  Meanwhile undergrounding of power lines is proceeding as there was general consensus that this was desirable.  Other work has been halted.",
