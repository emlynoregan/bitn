    "original_text": "Copper Interpretation Centre\n\nRumours say that the Copper Interpretation Centre, which was the major component of the Jubilee 150 Burra heritage Town Project, is dead.  The project was announced by the Premier in May 1983 as one of three major Jubilee 150 projects – the others being the Port Adelaide Maritime Museum and the restoration of Fort Glanville.  All were to be funded by a $2 million grant from the Commonwealth Government and Burra’s share was to be $470,000.\n\nFrom the start controversy has dogged Burra’s plans to have a Copper Interpretation centre – a concept of Ian Auhl and adopted by the Burra Burra DC.  The Heritage Conservation Branch requested the Department of Environment and Planning to conduct a feasibility study and that favoured spending the major part of the allocation on a selection of heritage projects instead of just on the Copper Interpretation Centre.  The Burra Burra DC voted unanimously to go on with the original concept.\n\nThe steering Committee was chaired by Barry Rowney of the Heritage Conservation Branch, who became the working party chairman.  There were representatives from the Heritage Conservation Unit., the History Trust of SA, the Department of Tourism, the Department of Mines and Energy, the Burra Burra DC and Burra National Trust.\n\nThe Burra Burra DC had some years earlier purchased the Salvation Army Citadel with the idea of its being developed as the Copper Interpretation Centre.  An officer from the Heritage Conservation Branch deemed this to be unsuitable because of its ‘social atmosphere’ and geographic location.  Other sites then considered were:\n\nA new building at the Bon Accord Mine site.\n\nA new building adjacent to Peacock’s Chimney.\n\nA new building on the plateau on the eastern side of the Mine Pool.\n\nA new building where Morphett’s Pumphouse boiler house stood.\n\nDesigns were drawn up and the first completed were costed at about twice the available funds.  Amended designs cut the building virtually in half, gave minimal space to administration, but retained an adequate gallery area and the plateau site was chosen.  The working party approved this and Barry Rowney of the Heritage Conservation Branch indicated verbally that the Branch would recommend approval.\n\nTenders were called and the lowest received was about 100% over the estimated cost.  The working party immediately moved to vary the proposal slightly and move it to the boiler house site with a building the same size and similar silhouette to the former boiler house.  Two architects have indicated their interest and belief that this building could be achieved within budget and could be completed by the target date of October 1986.\n\nRumours of the scuttling of the whole project and for the reallocation of the funds elsewhere have been circulating for two weeks.  The Burra Burra DC has sought urgent answers from the Premier.  The Department of Mines and Energy has been so supportive of the idea that it has already contributed $25,000 to be concentrated on Morphett’s Pumphouse and surrounds.  Burra’s Tourist Officer Jenny O’Connor has joined the Council in lobbying fiercely for the project and to counter the claim that Burra has been slow to react - though no meetings were held between January 1984 and November 1984 and then only at the insistence of the Burra Burra Dc Chairman James Hawker.  The allegation that there is now insufficient time to complete the project is denied by the architects.  Of concern id the allegation that the Heritage Conservation Branch, which has been closely associated with the project, will not now approve building on the boiler house site.  It has been alleged that the head of the Heritage Conservation Branch, Jon Womersley, when asked if his Department had any alternatives to offer, said, ‘No’.",

The Copper Interpretation Centre was intended to interpret SA’s copper mining and place SA’s copper mining towns in a world perspective.  Burra was recognised as the appropriate place for this by the Board of Jubilee 150 and as a result of a concept by R.J. Noye of Clare and lobbying by myself and the Burra Burra DC a grant of $270,000 was made to establish the Copper Interpretation Centre.  The Centre would give SA a genuine historic town to show visitors - SA’s counterpart at Maldon in Victoria – and not to Swan Hill or Sovereign Hill.  Burra is the genuine article.  ‘Surely Burra will protest en masse to having its money, honestly obtained, dishonestly sidetracked to some other project.’",

The cost over-run of $64,000 on the Jubilee 150 job creation scheme at Paxton Square cottages was met by Council in the first instance.

A crowd of more than 200 attended the new air-conditioned building next to the Burra Hotel.  A feature of the building is its façade in bluestone taken from the old Farmers’ Union building that was on the same site.  It and the bullnosed verandah are both in keeping with Burra’s heritage.  Branch manager Andrew Butler said the new premises would be an asset to the rural community in Burra and district.  It would offer a bigger and better showroom and improved product display.  John Secomb, the Dalgety Bennetts Farmers’ northern regional manager, said that when he started in Burra with Oates Ltd in 1960 there were five stock agents in town.  Today there were two.  Noel O’Brien, the firm’s general manager, also spoke at the opening.",

Tim Butler of Radio 5CK compered the ball that night in the Soldiers’ Memorial Hall.  Many attended in period costume.  Ralph Oakley won the beard growing contest for those who started clean shaven on 3 August.  Dave Parnell won the longest beard of all prize.  Sunday’s combined church service was conducted by former resident Fr Laurie Quinn assisted by Fr Richard Morris, Rev. Malcolm Thomas and Fr Eugene Kelly.

For some years the Council has had plans to underground the electricity, improve traffic flow and redesign parking.  Although plans have been publicised they did not clearly show the position and design of the new lightin poles.  The type of light pole has created concern.  The standard goose-neck poles were deemed unsuitable for a heritage town and their position on proposed protuberances has also roused concern.  In presenting the petition Mrs Wright spoke about Burra as a Heritage Town and urged the Council to reconsider the pole choice.  Mr John Modra of the Highways Department spoke outlining the accepted standards and stressed that the safety factor.  The funding arrangements were also outlined.  Council accepted the petition and will discuss the situation at its executive meeting early this week.  Meanwhile undergrounding of power lines is proceeding as there was general consensus that this was desirable.  Other work has been halted.",

    "original_text": "The Burra Burra DC has recently acquired the Ian Auhl Burra History Collection.  The collection, which will be kept in the custody of the Burra Community Library, consists of an indexed collection of newspaper references to the Burra Burra Mine and its townships covering the period from the discovery of copper in 1845 to the closure of the Burra Burra Mine in 1877.\nIt also includes a biographical index of names of people mentioned in the references, a collection of maps relating to Burra and district, a collection of photographs and negatives relating to Burra and district, a library of books relating to Burra and an extensive collection of miscellaneous references to the Mine and its townships and various other indexes.\nThe collection was begun in 1965 when Ian Auhl was principal of Burra Primary School.  It finished in 1985 with the submission to the publishers of the author’s book The Story of the Monster Mine – The Burra Burra Mine and its Townships 1845-77.  It began with items researched from copies of the SA Register dating from 1852 and held by the Burra Institute Library.  When Mr Auhl was transferred to Adelaide in 1969 arrangements were made for the State Library to photocopy each newspaper item.  Subsequently each item researched and submitted was photocopied and all newspaper items were microfilmed and negatives made of all photographs.  The collection was begun when the author was preparing tourist pamphlets and realised that Burra had no local paper till 1876.  No books on the history of the mine and its townships existed apart from some centenary publications.\nThe intended use of the material was to prepare tourist pamphlets and then a short history of the mine and its townships.  This resulted in the publication in 1969 of the Burra Sketchbook with drawings by Maurice Perry, which has been reprinted five times.  It was subsequently used in the compilation of the Burra Conservation Study in 1978 and in various Burra histories and to make submissions to the District Council and in making submissions for heritage listing for Burra Buildings and of course for Ian Auhl’s major history as mentioned, to be published in 1986.  It has supplied authors, organisations, families and individuals with information on the history of Burra and its people.  Mr Auhl has said that he considers the Conservation Study of 1978 to be the most valuable result of the collection.\nOriginally the collection was to be housed in the Copper Museum and Interpretation Centre.  The author’s ill health and doubts about the funding for that centre have made it necessary for the author to agree to the housing of the collection in the Burra Community Library, in the care of the Library Board of Management in accordance with an agreed management policy drawn up by the Librarian Colin Fidock.  A complete copy of all but the photographic material has been made by the librarian of the Mortlock Library.  Both the Burra Community Library and the State Library are processing the material to make it available for public access in 1986.  The author and librarians envisage the collection as growing in the future as there is still the period after the closure of the mine in 1877 to be researched and written about.",

They will replace the guttering and attend to flashings, ridge capping and parapet walls, waterproofing the last.  The windows will be sealed and the interior re-plastered in preparation for painting.  The 81-year-old pipe organ cost $700 in 1905 and was overhauled four years ago for $4,000.

This was a large job and the income came from key hire, bus tours and fund-raising.  Most of 1985’s objectives had been realised.  The J150 $30,000 allocated to the Bon Accord had been spent.  An application has been made for a $21,000 CEP grant to work on the Bon Accord surrounds and re-fence and define the car park.  $5000 was being spent on a case to house Pam Marlow’s mine model and a History Trust grant of $8,500 will be spent on display and interpretation.

Councillors are willing to accept praise for minor works done, but will not seriously discus the levels of rates, which are high.  He says there is no way they can afford to spend $650,000 on the Market Square project.  Also the administrative costs are excessive at 52% of income, when Hallett DC has only 26%.\n\nE.T. Baulderstone  writes on Paxton Square costs.\n\nHe writes as Treasurer of the Lewis Board of Management.\n\nThe following is an outline of the management, finance, etc. of the Paxton Square Cottages Project.\n\nMost people are aware that the cottages contribute to the history of SA and Australia.\n\nI have been connected with their management for the past 20 years and wish to bring the correct facts to the notice of the grumblers who insist their rates are spent financing these cottages.\n\nAbout four years ago the cottages were transferred to the Burra Burra DC gratis, the main reason being that the Council was in a position to receive grants, etc. for their development.\n\nDuring the last three years approximately $500,000 has been made available in grants etc.\n\nThe Council appointed a management board to manage these grants and arranged for a loan of $100,000 for the first stage, which opened in April 1983 as holiday cottages.\n\n18 months later the second stage was opened.\n\nSince being in operation, the board has paid all loan repayments, amounting to over $65,000 and capital expenditure $42,000, in addition to the maintenance and operating costs.\n\nWe are now in a position to contribute $40,000 towards the third stage with a cost of $120,000.\n\nThe Council has arranged for a loan of $80,000 for the balance, which will be repaid from our profits and will cost the ratepayers nothing, while making the property more valuable.\n\nA complete financial statement is rendered at each monthly meeting of the board and a copy is forwarded to Council.\n\nA yearly statement is presented at the annual public meeting attended by very few ratepayers.\n\n‘Stop grumbling and uttering false statements among the people of our community.  I am available at most times to answer queries in a sensible manner.’",

    "original_text": "The Redruth Guild Diamond Jubilee luncheon was attended by about 100 people.  It was a luncheon and musical afternoon and as it was to be the Guild’s final gathering before closure, it was attended by many former ministers and their wives.  Redruth Wesleyan Church was established in 1851, but later demolished.  A second church was built in 1857 and the present building was erected in 1874.  When Burra became a town with just one Methodist Church, the services were held at the Kooringa Church, but the Guild continued for many years, finding fellowship and raising funds for the church.  The final act of the Guild will be to donate its funds to the renovation of the Redruth Church so it can be used as a worship centre for the Redruth Camping Centre or for a museum.  Reta Jennison was the Guild Secretary for some 52 years and then became President up to its final meeting.  The Guild has been operating for 61 years.",

Eunice Baker, a member of BPO, said although she felt uncomfortable participating in the blockade, she saw it as a last ditch attempt to preserve the square.\n\nBPO believes the proposed changes with road widening and new car parking spaces would destroy the historical character of the square and restrict the free flow of traffic.  Burra District Clerk Rod Walsh said the changes were needed to improve traffic management.\n\nA petition prepared by BPO was signed by more than 800 people.  Council Chairman James Hawker said people had been misled about the changes and intimidated into signing the petition.  A blatantly inaccurate map of the changes had accompanied the petition.\n\nDerek Rayfield in a letter to the Argus blamed the Council itself for the story regarding the removal of the Rotunda and the rose garden.  He denied any improper actions in collecting the 819 signatures.  Council has said in a circular that the lack of formalised parking arrangements results in illegal parking and hazardous traffic manoeuvres and Council fears for its legal position in the event of accidents.\n\nLast November 570 people signed a petition calling a halt to the installation of new electricity [i.e. light] poles in Market Square.  They deemed the standard goose-necked poles unsuitable for a heritage town and as a result those installed were removed.  Council now proposes to install round-type ETSA post-top lights and there will be no goose-neck poles.\n\nIn January the re-development was halted when the Community Employment Program notified Council that an oversight had been made in not getting the changes approved by the Australian Heritage Commission.  A meeting in Adelaide on 21 February resulted in the State Heritage Branch indicating its assent for the scheme to continue.  The estimated cost for the project is $109,000 of which $50,000 comes from a J150 Local Government Road Assets Program loan with a subsidised interest rate of 9% for 12 years and a grant of $54,000 from the Community Employment Program.  Council’s contribution is $5,800.",

The gaol came into Burra National Trust control some nine years ago and they have since done considerable work to conserve it.  It was built in 1856 as the first gaol in SA outside the metropolitan area of Adelaide.  It later served as a girls’ reformatory and more recently as a location for the film Breaker Morant.  It receives about 3,000 visitors a year.  Burra’s share of the grant is to be $50,000.  [Photo.]",

Cr James Hawker met the Governor and Lady Dunstan at the kerbside and accompanied them into the hall where Sir Donald Dunstan declared the ball officially open.  Mr Hawker presented the Governor with a copy of Ian Auhl’s new book, The Story of the Monster Mine.  During his speech the Governor said his great great grandfather had walked to Burra in 1847 and the family had lived for a time in dugouts in the creek.  Later, upon hearing that Florrie Scroop was Australia Day Award winner for the Jubilee Year, Lady Dunstan sent her the posy she had been given on arrival.  A troupe of dancers from Danse Victoriana performed during the evening.  A contingent of BCS students assisted on the night as did the Queen’s Scouts and their leader David Jennings.",

How fortunate that it was covered up and not removed.  In the same week the unique signpost in Market Square was removed.  Hoe many years had that been part of Burra?  Over the years much heritage has been removed.  In recent years the main school building and the Town Hall steps have been under threat and the maternity wing of the hospital has been demolished.  What will be threatened next?  Will the wall in front of Polly’s Tea Rooms be plastered or the wooden steps from the road destroyed.  The proposed Ludgvan Street deviation will see more destroyed and the railway overpass will probably be bulldozed so it can be enlarged.  The expensive mess that is now Market Square will not prevent accidents.  The signpost should be returned and restored to its original state with wooden posts and chains.",

About half the time was taken in research and development of techniques.  The model is part of the Burra Burra DC’s Jubilee Project.  The model is at a scale of 1:87, which allows for about half a square kilometre to be displayed.  The model shows the mine in its peak of prosperity.  The general landscape has been created from plaster over chicken wire to which individual module boards containing groups of building fit.  This has been done because Pam has lived at Aldgate and Pinnaroo since 1983 and this permits her to work at home.  The model will be open to the public view from 5 October.",

It covers organisation, design, promotion and economic restructuring.  Over 600 American towns have used the program to reverse trends of a dying main commercial street.  Economic expertise was needed as well as the services of perhaps an architect or consultant on trading.  The scheme would restore buildings externally to what they were.  Owners of premises should wait till they could afford to restore buildings properly.  Nothing looks sadder than unused buildings.  Signage should be unobtrusive.  Slides of examples of good restoration from Port Adelaide, Gawler, and Aldgate were shown.  In Burra food availability needs improvement and things like aluminium tiles on old cottages spoil the character of the town.",

Speakers will include Kym Bonython, Chairman of the J150 Board.  The three foot thick walls of Morphett’s Enginehouse now stand as strong as they did last century.  A pumping accident nearly tore the place apart in the 1870s and a fire that gutted the Enginehouse and the shaft in the 1920s left it a ruin.  A J150 allocation of $90,000 and the Department of Mines & Energy grant of $35,000, plus contributions from the Burra Burra DC and the Department of Tourism have seen the building restored.  It is now the world’s only restored Cornish Enginehouse.  Burra Apex has been working to restore the adit tunnel to the shaft and they hope to have it ready for Sunday’s opening.

Two thousand miners and their families had lived in dugouts in the creek banks, but floods had forced them out so Paxton Square was built.  There were a few changes over the years.  Verandahs were added in the 1930s and the rows of backyard toilets were later removed.

The mine’s main shaft was utilised as the town’s water source in the 1870s* when the Burra Mine closed.  Water from ‘The Bon’ was piped into Burra until 1966 and afterwards the E & WS Department gradually transferred the site to the National Trust.

He thanked the various members of the working party and the contractors and architects and also Adelaide & Wallaroo Fertilizers for help with site works and fencing and Burra Apexians for more than 800 hours of volunteer work.  Kym Bonython spoke as Chairman of the J150 Board.  Keith Johns said his great grandfather was Thomas Roberts, Burra’s first mine captain.  Just as he was about to declare the project open, a severe rainstorm burst over Burra, scattering the assembled people, but later the weather improved and buses ran a shuttle service to allow people to visit the three sites of the project.",

    "original_text": "Ratepayers Wish to Secede\n\n193 Burra Burra Dc ratepayers have proposed seceding from the District and joining Hallett DC.  A hearing will be held in November.  Hallett DC has proposed to the Local Government Advisory Commission that the Hundreds of Kingston, Mongolata, Rees and part of Ayers be annexed to Hallett.\n\nSpokesman for the 193 ratepayers, Bob Gebhardt, said Burra roads and Council plant were run down because of lavish expenditure on unnecessary projects like the J150 project and tourist ventures.  Also Burra rural rates were twice those of Hallett and there was no communication between the Council and ratepayers.\n\nBurra Burra District Clerk, Rodney Walsh refused to comment.  A meeting of Booborowie and Mt Bryan residents (who are in the affected area) set up a steering committee of twelve at a meeting on 26 June to plan the secession.  Further ratepayer meetings were held at Mt Bryan on 15 September and at Hallett on 18 September.  Chairman of the Hallett DC, John Hale, said that Council was in favour of the move.  Hallett had only one permanent and one casual staff, while Burra had 6 administration staff.  The change would add one to Hallett’s staff.  They would like to see Burra return to a Corporation while Hallett took care of rural ratepayers.",
