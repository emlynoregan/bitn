    "original_text": "Ian Auhl writes a letter to the editor commenting on the Copper Interpretation Centre Crisis.\n\nIf Burra loses the Jubilee 150 grant it threatens the viability of the town itself as a tourist town.  The Copper Interpretation Centre was intended to interpret SA's copper mining and place SA's copper mining towns in a world perspective.  Burra was recognised as the appropriate place for this by the Board of Jubilee 150 and as a result of a concept by R.J. Noye of Clare and lobbying by myself and the Burra Burra DC a grant of $270,000 was made to establish the Copper Interpretation Centre.  The Centre would give SA a genuine historic town to show visitors - SA's counterpart at Maldon in Victoria – and not to Swan Hill or Sovereign Hill.  Burra is the genuine article.  'Surely Burra will protest en masse to having its money, honestly obtained, dishonestly sidetracked to some other project.'\n\nPerhaps the time has come got the town to strike against the delaying tactics of a government department 'which seems to have decided from the very beginning of negotiations that it knows what it best for Burra'.\n\nI have protested personally to the Premier and to the State Ombudsman with no tangible results.  Other concerned people in Clare, Burra and Adelaide have also protested.\n\n'The net result of such protests is not a genuine attempt to find a satisfactory home for the Copper Centre, but to cease negotiations with Burra Council and to re-allocate the grant altogether.'",

The Copper Interpretation Centre is the major component of the Burra Heritage Town Jubilee 150 project.  The Council has repeated a request for an urgent meeting between the Burra Heritage Town Project and the executive committee of the Jubilee 150 Board to resolve the matter.\n\nCouncil is seeking to present and demonstrate a viable alternative within the project and to enable members of the Board and the working party to meet for discussions.  It considers it unfortunate and unwarranted for the Jubilee 150 Board to consider the reallocation of a portion of the monies already granted to Burra for the Heritage Town Project.  The cost over-run of $64,000 on the Jubilee 150 job creation scheme at Paxton Square cottages was met by Council in the first instance.  A special meeting of Council was called for Monday 30 September to discuss the situation and an urgent reconvening of the working party has been called for.  A petition opposing the reallocation of the monies has been organised.",

    "original_text": "Letter to the Editor from Helen Stockman\n\nI must add my voice to those already raised regarding the reallocation of $210,000 set aside for the Copper Interpretation Centre.  It seems the Jubilee 150 Board held that:\n\nBurra was slow to react to the crisis\n\nThere was not now time to complete the project.\n\nIt was only at the stage that tenders were received that the working party became aware of the architect's gross miscalculations and an approach was then immediately made to the Jubilee 150 Board to vary the proposal slightly – for a smaller building on the boilerhouse site rather than the larger one on the plateau.\n\nThe working party immediately consulted two architects who believe that the project as revised can be completed within budget and in the time available.  The official opening was always scheduled for October 1986.  The reallocation of the money has been done without conferring with Burra and in unseemly haste.\n\nWhen you employ an architect recommended by the Heritage Branch itself you expect the job is being done properly and it is quite unfair for Burra to be punished for that man's mistake.  Objections to the proposed site by the Heritage Conservation Unit should be investigated thoroughly.  To be totally purist about the ruins there is to let them decay until they finally collapse and that is not acceptable to me or to many others in Burra.  Enthusiastic support has been given by the Department of Mines and Energy.  Burra is not accustomed to making a botch of heritage based projects.",
