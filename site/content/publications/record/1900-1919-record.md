## XV, 398, 3 Jan. 1900, page 2-3

Boer War. E.W. Crewes presided at a meeting at the Burra Institute on 22 December whose object was to raise funds for sufferers in the South African War. No subscription lists are printed yet, but money is already coming in freely. Rev. W.G. Clarke spoke feelingly. The greatest sufferers would be those left behind and deprived of their breadwinners. Rev. Murphy seconded the motion recognising the bravery of the soldiers and calling for all efforts to augment the fund. Mr Winnall moved for the formation of a shilling fund in Burra. 2nd Mr Cox.

Numbers were down somewhat this year, but results have been excellent. During the year the departure of Arthur King was regretted as was the removal of Miss Davidson. Rev. Wilfred Murphy has been a very welcome replacement for Rev. King and his scripture lessons have been a delight. Miss Bertha Millar replaced Miss Davidson. Her dancing class on Saturday afternoons has been an unqualified success.

Annie B. Millar (Principal)

Redruth Court, 19 December

J. Morgan Local Health Inspector charged John Ford with keeping pigs in close proximity to the slaughterhouse. Ford denied it, saying the pigs had 1,000 acres to run on, but the SM pointed out that was all the more reason why they should not have been observed close to the slaughterhouse. Ford admitted not having written permission to keep pigs at all. Fined 10/- plus costs to a total of £2-6-0.

W.A. Rabbich was charged with feeding a sow on raw blood and denied the charge. John Morgan said the sties were about 100 yards from the slaughterhouse, which is situated alongside the railway line. He did not see the sow actually feeding, but did see the congealed blood in a trough the sow had access to. Mr Packard objected on the grounds that the charge related to Section 1 when the premises were on Section 2881. The SM dismissed the objection, saying the accused admitted he was the person intended by attending to defend the case. The defendant swore there was no blood in the trough and he had not killed since the Friday previous to the Monday inspection. He was supported by evidence from Richard Carpenter & W. Reynolds. The SM said he could not convict on the evidence and believed the inspector to have made a mistake. He gave a verdict against the Council for £2-11-0.

Burra United Friendly Societies’ Sports. A successful meeting was held on 26 December at Victoria Park. A shower of rain about 11 a.m. cleared the air and a day favourable for sports followed. The committee had much trouble to prepare the bicycle track this year, but with judicious expenditure they made it rideable. The gate takings of £48-8-0 were up on recent years. Secretary was H.W. Pearce, F.J. Carey was President, and the judges were W. Neville & C. Fuss. M. Rabbich was starter. The results are printed. [The day was dominated by the cycle events.]

An evening performance by the Petersburg Dramatic Co. of Broken Vows saw door takings of £15-13-6.

Burra Mutual Improvement Soc. held its first annual social in the Kooringa Wesleyan Lecture Hall on 20 December. The President Dr Brummitt presided.

J.J. Blott was given a farewell social at the Commercial Hotel on 2 January before his departure for WA.

Boer War. Mr Knapman, overseer at Booborowie Station and Mr Alfred Young, son of Mr Thomas Young, an old Burra resident, now of Melbourne, leave for the war in Transvaal.

Local Court. Corporal Noble has been appointed Clerk of the Local Court. The editor thought this unwise as he had a large district to attend to and could not do both duties justice. Mr Giles has been doing the job well for some months and should continue.

Salvation Army. The lady officers, Captain Stewart & Lieut. Butt, who have been in charge of the Salvation Army here for some months will be farewelled on Sunday. They will be succeeded by Captain Deeble and probably Lieut. Gullick. Captain Isabell Nicholls, who left here for the work several years ago, is visiting her native town. Mrs Melksham will also visit Kooringa this week and all her friends will be glad to know she is now in excellent health.

Dr Brummitt’s garden will again be the site for a Continental to aid the Burra Jubilee Benevolent Society. There will be songs, recitations, orchestral pieces and performance on the horizontal bar.

Mr J.J. Blott was given a social at the Commercial Hotel on 2 January on the eve of his departure for WA. 25 turned out to bid him farewell. E.W. Crewes presided.

W.H. Hardy writes complaining about unpatriotic sentiments expressed by some people re the Boer War – even some members of the Legislature – he is glad to see the local response to the shilling subscription.

T.S. Reynolds writes as ‘the first concentrator in Australia’. Being escorted over the Slag Extraction Works recently he was surprised at the number of gauges etc. needed to clean the copper and thinks that the Burra Mine could be working at a handsome profit given such modern equipment.

## Burra Town Council

Tenders accepted for lamp lighting: H. Tiver in North Ward for £7-14-0 and W. Geake for two lamps in Kooringa for £13. [Though the report says lamps for North Ward the sum involved suggests one.]

Burra Waterworks. The level of water in the well remains about the same. SAR is taking a considerable quantity.

Obituary. Mr Thomas Andrews, 3rd son of Mrs R. Andrews [and, according to the paper of 24 Jan. 1900, page 2, of the late Richard Andrews], was thrown from his horse and dislocated his neck.

He was employed by the Unicorn Brewery and had to attend to and water the horses. The accident occurred in the Brewery Yard. E.W. Crewes JP deemed an inquest unnecessary.

## XV, 401, 24 Jan. 1900, page 3

Burra Waterworks. The deputation of the Mayor, E.W. Crewes, and Councillors waited on the Commissioner of Public Works, the hon. R.W. Foster, supported by the District Members, Messrs Rounsevell and Holder. Mr Rounsevell said the position in Burra was grave. The plant was 15 years old and was originally second hand. The timbers and pipes were defective. They requested that the capital account be reduced to enable money to be spent on repairs. The corporation had paid 5% on a capital cost of £8,100 until 18 months ago when it was reduced to 4%, but still on the same capital value. The Corporation expects daily to hear that the engine has collapsed, while the mains and supply pipes constantly need repair. If the Burra Mine restarted the supply would instantly cease. The water quality was poor and really fit only for stock. His own impression was that the best thing would be for the Government to take over the scheme.

The Hon. J. Lewis said that the Burra people would probably be prepared to take over the scheme if the Government would accept £4,000 for the plant as it stood.

Hon. J. Warren thought the position dangerous for the town with supplies uncertain and of impure nature.

Hon. M.P.F. Basedow thought the Government had an obligation to ensure a safe and plentiful supply as a matter of public health and supported earlier speakers.

Rounsevell pointed out that other districts got a water supply at one quarter of the cost and Crs West and Williams endorsed the above.

The Commissioner accepted the need for reliable and good water supply and the problem posed by the possible reopening of the mine, but he could not be expected to accede to the £4,000 figure without becoming fully acquainted with the actual value of the plant. So a valuation will be made.

[Advertiser report.]

Burra Races will be held on 31 January in Dew’s Paddock. (Nominations published.)

Burra Mine. An effort to re-open the Burra Mine is being made, though the paper does not say how, or by whom.

Bicycle Sports are being arranged for Easter Monday at Victoria Park in conjunction with events at Petersburg and Broken Hill.

Boer War. The Transvaal Patriotic Fund stands at £153-10-4.

## XV, 402, 31 Jan. 1900, page 2

Obituary. The wife of Mr James Bennetts has died at Broken Hill on 24 January, aged 58. She was born near Austell, Cornwall, and migrated with her parents, Mr & Mrs E. Ellery, as a young child. They settled in Burra, living for some time in a creek dugout. In 1857 she married James Bennetts and they lived in Burra (except for a brief time at Wallaroo) till 1887, when they moved to Broken Hill. She leaves a husband, four sons and one daughter: Harry, Thomas and Edward at Broken Hill and Alfred at Kooringa and Mrs A.B. Wood of Broken Hill. She was for over 40 years a member of the Bible Christian Church. [Born Mary Ellery in Cornwall]

Methodist Union. A meeting of the three Methodist branches in Burra was held on 26 January which decided that the formal union of the churches would take place on 1 April and the congregations will worship together from the first Sunday in March. Sunday schools will unite on Sunday 4 March and the first quarterly meeting of the United Church will be held on 6 April.

Boer War. SA has decided to send 50 Bushmen to the South African War and the cost is estimated at £5,000, of which Adelaide has already contributed £1,600. The balance should be raised if possible within ten days. This is revealed in a letter from the Mayor of Adelaide to the Mayor of Burra, Mr E.W. Crewes. The Mayor has agreed to receive donations and the Record to acknowledge same.

## XV, 402, 31 Jan. 1900, page 3

John Melrose, of North Booborowie, has reported a man from his station is missing and he is of the opinion he has taken strychnine, from letters he left behind. M-C Jemison is investigating.

Cricket. A match is being arranged for Saturday week with Clare. Last Saturday at Victoria Park, Burra 126 defeated Mongolata 41 in the third match of the season between these two teams.

The Record reports on attitudes of the day:

‘Divorce are [sic] becoming far too sadly frequent in SA.’

‘Home life is losing its attractions in this age of feverish speculation, gambling and loose living.’

‘This climate of ours which entices people to spend so much of their time out of door [sic] is destroying the domestic hearth.’

‘The young people get out to [sic] much of evenings, and the old fashioned dictum of spending evening indoors with the family circle is getting to be regarded as an eccentricity.’

Boer War. The Transvaal Patriotic Fund has reached £166-13-2.

## XV, 403, 7 Feb. 1900, page 2

Fitzgerald Bros. Circus on 31 January was a great success.

‘The lion rode on the elephant’s back and the tiger did likewise on the horse’s back, while new acts and feats were accomplished by man and beast.’

The Douglas Correspondent wrote to say that it was so dry east of Burra that even the rabbits had moved on to greener pastures.

## XV, 403, 7 Feb. 1900, page 2-3

Burra Races, in F. Dew’s Paddock last Wednesday.

This was the first race meeting since 1896, but the club is now registered and in good order. Costs of establishing the event were quite high. A room had to be built for the totalizator. Excursion fares were available from Adelaide and Petersburg and Fitzgerald’s Band was an attraction. Hon. J. Lewis MLC & W.B. Rounsevell MP, club patrons, were present. 400-500 would have been judged a satisfactory turnout, but in fact about 1,000 assembled. The tote handled £357 in the day which netted £26 for the club in commission. Larry O’Brien won the tender for liquor and E. Jordan that for eatables. The prize money was not great, only £70, but a better total is hoped for the future.

The top prize money went to the Burra Handicap over 11⁄2 miles when 1st prize was £20 and 2nd £5. The winner was Mr J.T. Hill’s b. g. Scutum 5yrs, by Escutio – Lady Elizabeth, ridden by F. Hill.

Unfortunately in the Flying Handicap a young jockey, J.H. Doherty, aged 12, was killed. In a cloud of dust at the finish Doherty collided with the finishing post, fracturing his skull and never regaining consciousness. He died in hospital that night c. 11.30 p.m.

Obituary & Inquest into the death of James H. Doherty, jockey.

[Born James Hilarian Doherty 21 October 1887: died 31 January 1900 aged 12]

E.W. Crewes JP as coroner and C. Fuss as foreman of the jury.

W.J. Richards said he saw the lad ride into the post as far as he could judge in the dust. He helped August Fuss put the lad into a trap for the hospital.

Dr Sangster operated to relieve pressure on the brain, but the damage was such as to preclude the possibility of recovery and death occurred about 11.30 p.m.

Augustine St Justin Doherty, brother of the deceased, thought his brother incapable of controlling the mare – both parents however, had consented. Deceased had been riding in races since 26 December 1898. He thought the posts [i.e. those marking the track] should have been painted or had flags on them. The turn into the straight was also too sharp, which made the running dangerous for large fields. [There had been nine horses in the race concerned.]

William Turner Thompson gave the most detailed account of the accident – seeing the horse suddenly veer right, apparently trying to avoid the post, and the jockey was leaning to the left and collided with it. The rider was thrown back onto the hindquarters and fell off on the right hand side some four yards past the post. He also considered the posts should have been painted and that the turn was unsafe.

The jury decided that death was due to accidental collision with a post on the Burra Race Course and regretted having to add that the parents were somewhat to blame for allowing a lad of ‘tender years’ to ride in the race.

James Tie, a Chinese gardener of Black Waterholes, met with a serious accident on his way home on

Saturday. He lost control of his horse and dray on an incline near his garden and the dray capsized. He was thrown into the creek where he lay unconscious for some hours. He was found by his wife who then sent for Mr Reed who conveyed him to the Burra Hospital. He remains unconscious with a concussion that seems likely to prove fatal. He is aged 40. [Note that in the report of his death in the next issue he is said to be 48.]

Boer War. The Transvaal Patriotic Fund stands at £173-18-2.

Sydney Elsborough, a young man who disappeared from the North Booborowie Station, was found in a demented state and brought to the Burra Hospital.

Court.

Thomas Kent a ‘cutter’ [i.e. a sharpener of blades] was found guilty of picking the pocket of Mr William Escott Escott of Koonoona at the recent Burra Races. He was seen by both M-C Jemison and August Fuss, but he proclaims his total innocence. He was sentenced to two months in Adelaide Gaol.

Weather. On 6 February it was 101°F in Burra.

Burra Town Council.

£356 has been allotted for main roads in 1900.

Notice boards ordering people to ‘Walk round corner’ are to be repainted.

Commercial St footpath to be tar dressed from F. Harris’s shop to Drew & Crewes’ and from Park’s shop to O’Leary’s.

The assessment is to stay at the 1899 level.

Some repairs have been effected at the Waterworks, including timbering of the well. These have increased the capital account to £8,104-10-1.

Interest to June next is £162-3-6.

The SAR has taken 75,000 gallons from 9 to 24 January.

## XV, 404, 14 Feb. 1900, page 2

A Continental in Mrs H.S. Dunn’s garden at Redruth on 23 February will aid the Wesleyan Church.

(Ice cream provided.)

Boer War. The Wesleyan Church held intercessional services for the war last Sunday and a special collection in aid of the Nurses Fund raised £4.

Nurse Bidmead of the Burra hospital left for Adelaide last Saturday. She has been chosen as one of the six SA nurses to go to Transvaal. She was presented with a small purse of sovereigns.

Mr Field, of Monavea, was on the road near the Burra Mill when his horse unaccountably began kicking and continued to do so till it had smashed the front of the trap, broken the shafts and freed itself from the buggy.

Kooringa Bible Christian Church celebrated its 50th anniversary on 11 & 12 February and held the usual tea on Monday.

Obituary. James Tie died in the Burra Hospital on 9 February after the accident reported in the last issue. He was aged 48 and leaves a wife and adopted child.

[Registered as Foon Tie Chong (surname Chong) died aged 43]

Obituary. Thomas Hutchins, aged 85, died at his Aberdeen residence on 9 February. His wife, aged 79, died last June. He was born in England in 1815 and arrived in SA in the early days of the colony and settled at Bungaree and later at Iron Mine as a farmer for 13 years before coming to Aberdeen. He became a member of the Primitive Methodist Church in 1835 and was a local preacher and circuit treasurer. He leaves six adult daughters.

Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

This was the first annual report, though actually only for five months as it was a new appointment.

In general the sanitary conditions in town were satisfactory, due mainly to the activities of the Inspector. The main problem in the period was an influenza outbreak in October and November of 1899.

In the six months to 31 December 1899 there were 22 deaths. Of these 8 were in the hospital, 4 the result of accident and 10 elsewhere.

The town population is estimated at 1,700-1,800, there having been no census for some time.

Recommendations:

A new slaughterhouse with sales of meat restricted to inspected meat.

A new rubbish depot as material from the present one enters the creek and thence the town. ‘Excrete which is deposited there should be better disposed of.’

The water service needs more supervision. He was most concerned about the problem of dead end pipes.

Boer War. The Transvaal Patriotic Fund has reached £178-7-2.

A special ‘auction’ raised money for the ‘Bushman’s Contingent’ amounting to £72-16-6.

Boer War. Mr C.R. Treloar, son of Mr Frank Treloar, late popular manager of Gum Creek Station, has decided to accompany the Bushmen’s Contingent to South Africa. He is 23 and an experienced horseman.

Court.

The following were charged with disturbing the peace:

Charles Stritch Sappho Halls Morris Geoghagen

William Knevett Walter Newell Stanley Bewley

Edward Moore Alfred Bevan Thomas Rosewall

The charges against Bevan and Rosewall were later withdrawn when they were found to have arrived late at the scene. All the rest pleaded not guilty.

Bevan’s evidence. Had arrived at Welsh Place c. 11 p.m. on 3 February and found Stritch rowing and fighting and hollowing in a disturbance which had lasted c. 3⁄4 of an hour. Halls was present, but did not start it: he was looking on. Knevett was present. Bevan saw Stritch strike Knevett who tried to defend himself, but was too young. He also saw Stritch strike Bewley who did nothing. Halls took Bewley’s part. Moore was present with Rosewall and Bevan, but took no part. Newell was present and had been drinking, but was not drunk and caused no row in Bevan’s presence.

Thomas Rosewall’s evidence largely agreed with the above. He thought Stritch had caused the row.

Stritch said he had come in from McBride’s Norman Farm with a horse and trap. When he came out of the hotel someone had let the horse loose, this happened a second time and things were removed from his trap and a bottle of beer taken from his pocket. He said two or three of a group of boys were teasing him.

After hearing all the evidence the charges against Rosewall and Bevan were withdrawn. Halls, Bewley, Newell and Moore were discharged. Stritch, Knevett, and Geoghagen were fined 10/- + 13/4 costs or in lieu, 14 days.

Francis Harris Charles Schultz John Stephen Beale

Each fined 2/6 + costs for owning various straying animals.

## XV, 405, 21 Feb. 1900, page 3

Thistlebeds. The Challenge Cricket Club met on Wednesday and decided to resume their weekly practices on the land near the Douglas Primitive Methodist Chapel on Saturday afternoons at 2 p.m.

Douglas Primitive Methodist Chapel held harvest thanksgiving services on 11 February and on 12 February there was a sale of fruit and a lecture from Mr S. Olley on his trip to England.

Boer War. News of the relief of Kimberley spread on Saturday morning and the town was soon decked in flags. There was a public meeting in Market Square presided over by the Mayor with patriotic speeches and thanks to God for the deliverance.

The first SA death in the war was noted: a young man from Mt Gambier.

Patriotic songs were sung. J.E.H. Winnall sang The Englishman.

W.B. Page sang Old England and the New.

Robert Warner sang Three Cheers for the Red, White and Blue.

The Nurses Fund gained £3-10-0 from a collection and the meeting ended with the National Anthem and Rule Britannia.

Similar outbursts of patriotic fervour are noted from Adelaide and elsewhere.

Vandalism. M-C Jemison found two lads trying to damage the water trough in Market Square. They are to apologise to the Council at the next meeting.

Obituary. Annie Smith, widow of the late Peter Smith, residing with her 90-year-old mother, has been burnt to death. The old lady was out in the yard getting water when the daughter ran into the yard with her dress all alight. The flames were extinguished by neighbours, but Mrs Smith died shortly after Dr Brummitt arrived. [The marriage information suggests she may have been born Anne Lynch who married Peter Smith at Mintaro 19 October 1864. Her age matches this person, but the only very old Mrs Lynch registered as dying in SA was Bridget, widow of Michael, who died at Yongala aged 106 on 10 September 1905, so she doesn’t fit in with being 90 in 1900.]

Kooringa Primitive Methodist Church harvest thanksgiving was held last Sunday. Next Sunday the church will be open for the last time.

Obituary. Mrs Lane, mother of the Kooringa postmaster, has died in Glenelg. She fell victim to the recent influenza epidemic a few months ago and recently went to Glenelg in the hope of a more complete recovery, but it was not achieved. She had a large circle of friends in Burra.

Editorial on The Boer War.

Burra Waterworks. The Government has decided it cannot lower either the interest rate or the capital account on the Burra Waterworks. In the face of Mr Foster’s reply to the deputation this seems very queer.

Burra Waterworks. The Town Council on 26 February received a letter in response to the Waterworks Deputation on 17 January. The Conservator of Water says the works are in a fair condition and it has been decided that no reduction can be made in the capital cost as interest has already been reduced from 5% to 4%.

Burra Slag Extraction Co. continues to work steadily at the old smelts.

W.H. Hardy writes concurring with the editor that the Government is treating the town shabbily over the Waterworks. The reply from the Minister to the latest delegation was ‘knowingly made up of untruths and nonsense’. The Council was unwilling to hand the works over to the Government without first approaching the Government for a better deal. Mr Foster spoke most favourably of the justice of our complaints and has led us to believe that something could be done, but after waiting weeks nothing has changed. Despite the Minister’s claim no inspection or valuation was made and as a result I have moved to have the works returned to the Government. It is about time people began to object to being treated so shabbily.

Dr Brummitt’s departure to visit England.

Dr Brummitt came to Burra 23 years ago and from the start strove to work for the town and its people. He has always attended to has various duties and positions unostentatiously. Much of his work has never received public acknowledgement. He is a most skilled physician and surgeon. On arriving in 1877 he began practice with the late Dr Nesbit and then by himself when the latter left the town. He was a valued member of the Wesleyan Church and an earnest local preacher and has been church treasurer and treasurer of the supernumerary fund for SA. He worked for Methodist Union and was very influential in bringing that about. He was the prime mover of the Burra Jubilee Benevolent society, President of the Burra Institute in 1878 and in 1882 became its treasurer and has remained such till now. For four years he was Chairman of the Burra School Board of Advice. He was Mayor 1894-97 and poured oil on troubled waters when the Council was in turmoil. [Actually he was Mayor Dec. 1883-Nov. 1884 and Dec. 1894 to Nov. 1897.] He was a member of Burra Burra Lodge MUIOOF and Medical Officer at Burra Hospital throughout. He intends to spend a few months at the great London Hospitals to study the latest improvements and leaves for England on 12 April. His two sons are staying in Adelaide to complete their university studies.

It is now known as part of the Paratoo Run. He then purchased Markaranko Station, a lease on the Murray, which he held for 19 years. He worked very hard improving his properties and fighting vermin and other odds, like bad seasons. He added to Mt Cone by purchasing land from Mr Lewis in 1871 (Wildotta), where he built his residence of Mackerode. On retiring he went to live in Glenelg. At one time he had the best flock of Lincolns in the colony, but the run was later restocked with Merinos. He recently acquired both Pareora and Corryton Park. In 1875 he and his family took a twelve month trip to Germany. He leaves a widow and seven children: Messrs Charles E., L.W., & A. Gebhardt of Mackerode and A.G. of Pareora (Pt Wakefield). He also leaves two brothers and sisters.

He was, in retirement, a member of the Lutheran Church in Flinders St, Adelaide.

W.H. Hardy writes again on the Waterworks. [He had been criticised in Council for his previous letter: it being deemed discourteous to write it while the Council was awaiting a reply from the Government.] He affirms his former stand and complains that Cr McLaren moved ‘That the members of this Council having with regret noticed that a member of it has in the public press, discussed a matter between this Council and the government, whilst the Council was awaiting the reply from the Government to their letter, hereby pass their censure on Cr Hardy for his unbusiness-like and discourteous action’.

Since this inspection in 1899 was so recent it was not deemed necessary to have a further special inspection.

No further concession can be made beyond the reduction of interest already granted of 5% to 4%.

Burra Slag Extraction Co. Mr C.A. Lott was severely injured in an accident on Monday morning. Heavy castings were being unloaded when a casting slipped over the side of the skids causing a piece of timber 6” x 4” x 18’ to fly through the air, grazing his cheek, and knocking him down, breaking his collarbone. Immediately the shifting weight of the casting caused the timber to be brought down on top of Mr Lott, breaking three ribs. Had he not fallen in a small gutter he would probably have been crushed to death. The victim was badly bruised and his face and neck were swollen almost beyond recognition. Although very painful, the injuries are now mending.

Sappho Halls was charged that on 31 March he wilfully and wantonly disturbed Norah McNamara by tapping on her window about 11 p.m. [The evidence suggests he was playing some sort of game by pretending to have found someone else doing the tapping, but he was seen by Mrs McNamara.]

He pleaded guilty and was fined £1 + 10/- costs or 14 days. The fine was paid.

Aboriginal Body. The remains of an Aboriginal were discovered at New Aberdeen last week. Local geologists consider he died at least 100 years ago because of the marks on the bones and their condition. It is not possible to be sure whether he was buried or the body was covered by ‘the sands of time’, though the latter seems most likely. [The following is a separate article on the same page about this discovery.]

DISCOVERED AFTER MANY YEARS

Mr A. Fuss, was engaged excavating his back yard at New Aberdeen on Thursday morning when he came across one or two bones. This raised his curiosity, because he was always under the impression that his yard was composed of virgin soil. He became interested in his somewhat strange discovery and proceeded carefully about the work. After a few drives of the pick and the application of the shovel additional bones were found, and Mr Fuss than came to the conclusion that before ‘his time in the world’ someone had been buried there. Curiosity ran very high and he called in a second party to make a full investigation. Subsequently the skeleton of an aboriginal was unearthed. The body was intact but the bones from the hips down were disarranged, still the large bone of one of the legs was complete down to the foot. The right arm when the body was placed in the hole, which is about 18 inches below the surface, was put across the face and the fingers were bent under the palm of the hand. The front teeth were much decayed, but strange to say the molars on the jaw were remarkably well preserved, the ivory on the teeth being very plainly seen. Time has, apparently, with the aid of lime, transformed the bones into petrified stone. The skeleton measured about six feet, and it is said to be that of a male aboriginal. Quite a number of persons inspected the skeleton which has been buried again. Mr W.J. Davey under instructions photographed the relic which can be inspected at the Record Studio.

Water could only be brought by bucket and people strove hard to save the adjoining buildings, both of which were saved. As usual the facilities for procuring water were disgraceful – with a water main running past the building. An inquest on Tuesday found no explanation for the fire.

## Election Meeting at the Institute

Mr Moody: Independent.

He supported the State Bank. He probably supported household suffrage, though the report in the paper is not very clear. He supported Bundaleer and the Barossa water schemes.

[The reporting of this speech is poor as on several topics we get a statement without any indication of whether he was opposed or supportive.]

Mr Russell.

He favoured a £15 franchise and would support any bill for a reduction of the franchise for the Legislative Council. Eleven out of twenty-four Legislative Councillors were squatters! He was for a progressive taxation system, but opposed to any increase in land tax. He favoured closer settlement and for early closing in Adelaide, but not in the country.

Mr Pascoe.

He was against household suffrage for the Legislative Council. It was not a question, he said, of ability, but of stability. He thought the number of members should be reduced by at least one third. He favoured closer settlement. He opposed the Employers’ Liability Bill, was for early closing and against increased land taxes. He thought village settlements were started on the wrong lines.

Mr Lucas.

He represented the manufacturing and farming interests, and also labour. He had been Mayor of Gawler. He opposed any reduction of the Legislative Council franchise, but was for the wives of electors having the vote. He favoured water conservation and homestead blocks.

Inquest into Lasscock’s Fire, 20 April 1900. E.W. Crewes, coroner and W. Davey, foreman of the jury.

Lascock:

Closed the shop at 6 p.m. – went to Mr Page’s till 8 p.m. – don’t smoke and know of nothing to cause the fire. From 8 p.m. was at the Commercial Hotel – was told of the fire about 10.30 p.m. Was carrying about £255 worth of stock for the Federal boot Co. Know of no one threatening me and was giving up the agency of my own free will. Had the key with me. Lost my working tools and books. Valued the former at £30, though they would cost more to replace. Kitson repairs boots and left the place before I did. He smokes. Stocktaking was due, but was delayed at the request of Mr Bradley for the Boot Co. I always settled with the company at stocktaking

Charles Bradley.

Took stock on 21 November 1899 and called again last Wednesday, 18 April. Didn’t think there would be a deficiency of more than c. £20. The value of stock would have been £266-17-3 less £10-1-6 I received since.

Kitson.

Left the shop at 4.30 p.m. Was opposite about 10.05, but saw no fire then.

Two employees of the Commercial Hotel saw the fire and raised the alarm.

The verdict was that the origin of the fire was unknown.

Kitson Fund. 4/6 acknowledged.

Burra Jubilee Benevolent Soc., AGM on 3 May.

The President Dr Sangster, Vice-President P. Lane and Treasurer J.F. Moore.

Relief has been granted to 25 aged men and widows, 11 families (of 28 members). 478 orders have been made – 340 for firewood, 120 for groceries, and 18 for drapery. £12-9-6 came from the Mackerode bequest and £13-19-6 from John Roach’s lantern entertainment. E.C. Lockyer’s and Dr Brummitt’s garden Continentals raised £13-7-9. The society greatly misses Dr Brummitt with his departure for England.

The balance in the bank is £39-3-11, but this healthy sum will be surely needed as winter’s cold increases the distress of the poor.

Boer War. When news of Mafeking’s relief was received at midday on Saturday arrangements were made for a patriotic demonstration in Market Square. About 9.30 between 300 and 400 assembled to show their loyalty to the Queen and appreciation of the gallantry displayed by Colonel Baden-Powell in the defence of the town.

Sgt [Gilbert] Lewis writes, but so far he deals only with the voyage from Port Adelaide to Fremantle, en route to the Boer War.

## XV, 419, 30 May 1900, page 2

Boer War. The relief of Mafeking was celebrated with a mock ‘attack’ on the town by some 500 children who assembled at the Public School and then marched on the town centre and thence to the hospital where they sang God Save the Queen and gave three cheers for Baden-Powell. Hey marched back to the Square where they again sang the National Anthem and cheered Baden-Powell. Then news of strangers at Victoria Park seemed to threaten the supply of saveloys and rolls which had been provided for the troops. The strains of the Boys’ Brigade Drum and Fife Band urged the troops to go forth and attack their eatables. At Victoria Park it was found advisable to fire blank volleys to give the enemies a chance to escape, but all there carried white flags and the almost inexhaustible supply of lollies and apples together with the saveloys and rolls were enough to satisfy the appetites of all. Sports followed with cash prizes. The procession was headed by a large banner painted by Mr E. Jones, featuring a lion in a chariot drawn by two kangaroos and in front Kruger on a boar with the inscription: ‘They’re after me’. While the children’s demonstration went on some older residents placed an effigy of Kruger in a coach drawn by four horses and he was taken around town during the day while patriotic songs were sung by several young men. In the evening a large demonstration was held and the principal streets were paraded. In the evening ‘Kruger’ was held up to ridicule, tried by a jury, and condemned to death. A gallows was erected behind the Commercial Hotel and the sheriff demanded the body of ‘Oum Paul’. He was promptly despatched and after a time cut down and committed to the flames while a crowd sang Soldiers of the Queen etc. Despite the enthusiasm the whole thing went off in a disciplined way and was a credit to all who took part. Respectable residents, who rarely visit the streets, put in an appearance to witness the proceedings and show their loyalty to the Queen.

[William Pearce brought scorn and derision on his head when at the Literary Soc. meeting he used the word ‘Rabble’ to describe those attending the burning of Kruger in effigy. This was so unpatriotic that he had to write to the Record to explain that he had not intended this to apply to all those present, but only to a certain segment. He had, he said, ‘put his signature to the requisition presented to the Council and otherwise helped in a small way.’]

G.E. Dane writes as conductor of the Burra Orchestra, praising the Burra Brass Band and its conductor, W.J. Davey, for their role in the recent concert and saying that it received too little recognition in the subsequent review – doubtless because W.J. Davey was both the reviewer and publisher.

Dr Brummitt’s ninth holiday notes: A Visit to Cornwall.

North Ward Ratepayer writes complaining that the Council doesn’t spend money on making Victoria Park usable; that the sporting bodies have spent over £30 in the last nine months, but the Council has now refused the cyclists use of it for £2-2-0 on condition that the £2-2-0 be used on the park. This will force the Cycling Club to charge 1/- admission rather than 3d or 6d because they will need to spend their money on the park. They will ultimately turn to making their own track somewhere.

Ratepayers’ Meeting last Friday considered the slaughterhouse question. The Local Board of Health proposed taking over the lease from Messrs D. & J. O’Leary of the old slaughterhouse and spending enough to make it a compliant public slaughterhouse. The present lease had four years to run. The Board has the right to purchase then or renew the lease for 5, 7 or 14 years at an annual rental of £27. The sum needed to be spent is £75. The annual expenditure would be £111 which it was proposed to recover from charging the four local butchers a licence fee of £20 p.a. for large cattle and £10 p.a. for small, plus 3/- a head for large and 3d a head for small cattle. [The article becomes hard to follow, but it appears that they expected that the revenue from cattle would be £121-5-9 and that the four butchers together would pay a £20 licence fee plus a £10 licence fee for a total income of £151-5-9 p.a.]

The costs were estimated at annual rent of £27, renovation cost spread at £19 p.a. over four years, ongoing maintenance at £15 and the wages of a caretaker of £50 for a total of £111. This suggested a credit balance of £40-5-9 p.a.

Outside butchers would not be allowed to sell in Burra.

Only meat killed in Burra and inspected by the Burra inspector could be sold in Burra.

Mr Rabbich could see no reason why butchers should not go on killing at their own slaughterhouses and have the meat inspected there.

Cr Williams moved that in the opinion of this meeting it is advisable to take over the old slaughterhouse.

Cr Cox and Cr West supported the motion.

Cr Hardy said he had been a mover for the meeting because the Council had been divided. The cost of a new slaughterhouse could be as much as £700.

The motion when put was carried unanimously.

A.C. Noyes the popular music teacher has been advised by his doctor to take a month’s rest.

Local Court, 21 August

Thomas Kitchen was charged with obstructing a footpath in Kooringa on 28 July by allowing a vegetable basket to remain on the footpath in front of his premises longer than necessary for removing and housing the same. He had previously sent a letter pleading guilty, but the Bench demanded he attend and adjourned the case. When he attended he pleaded not guilty. The case depended on the Inspector being able to prove the basket he saw there at 3 p.m. was the same he saw there between 5 & 6 p.m. He could not do so and the case was dismissed without costs.

Robert Kewley of Hamilton was summonsed to show cause why he should not contribute to the support of his mother Eliza Kewley of Kooringa. Mrs Kewley 68 said she had received £7 in 12 years and it was three or four years since any payment. He was unmarried and she was destitute. A younger son, George, had kept her for the past 12 years, but he was now out of work in Broken Hill. She wanted 5/- a week. (Another son had not been heard of for 17 years.) Robert Kewley said his work was not constant and he got 10/- to 12/- a week on farms. The Bench ordered a payment of 3/- a week and the defendant seemed satisfied, paying six weeks’ allowance into the court.

Burra Defence Rifle Club. Burra fired a match against Orroroo last Wednesday and were given a 42 point handicap because they are still using the old Martini Henry Rifles while other clubs have modern rifles. Orroroo scored 620 and Burra 452 + 42 = 494.

A match on the same day saw J.A. Pearce produce the highest score of 84, W.B. Page one of 81 and R.D. Pascoe one of 80.

Burra Racing Club met at the Commercial Hotel on Friday in preparation for their next racing meeting in January 1901.

Burra Cycling Club held a sports meeting at Victoria Park on Monday. The weather was good, but there was a very small crowd of people. Since prizes totalled £12 and the rent cost £3-3-0 and incidentals £1-10-0 the cost of the enterprise was £16-3-0, but the gate brought in only £2-10-0. This makes the meeting a dismal financial failure with a deficit of £13-13-0.

The racing itself was good.

W.J. Richards won the 2 mile.

J. Bailey won the 1 mile.

C. Packard won the 1⁄2 mile.

They reached Pt Pirie at 4.45 a.m. and had breakfast at Knapman’s Hotel followed by a morning tour of the smelting and refining works. In the afternoon there was boating and a drive to the hills etc. On Monday the match took from 10 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. and Pt Pirie defeated Burra 716 to 695.

Burra Show, Friday 21 September.

This was a cold windy day with rain on Thursday and threatening on Friday, though none fell. The crowd was smaller than previously, but in general it was a success. The weather prevented some entries from getting to the ground. Cattle numbers compared well with last year and the Hon. J. Lewis secured the largest number of prizes. Sheep were the special attraction and the Champion Merino Ram went to E. Bowman and the Merino prize ewe to Gebhardt Bros.

There were few pigs. Flowers were better than last year.

The Burra Band played throughout the day.

The evening concert in the Institute was a success.

The gate took £51 which was down £27 on last year. The concert took £20.

Prize money amounted to £192 and the society will have a good balance for 1901.

William Seitner, wood carter of Baldina, was found not guilty of criminally assaulting his daughter.

W.H. Hardy responds to those who have complained that a band concert on a Sunday is immoral. He acknowledges the argument s in favour of keeping Sunday as a day of quiet contemplation etc. He looks on Sunday as ‘the one day of freedom, of enjoyment and recreation to those who work the week through. But at the present time anything more desolate and discouraging than Sunday is not to be conceived’. He goes on to list the forms of amusement that are closed firmly, but what are open are ‘the dreary streets and public house corners to lounge on’.

‘Half the rascality and a good deal of drunkenness can be attributed to Sunday.’

‘Sabbath was made for man, and not man to fit any theory of what ought to be, however well meant the interpretation may be. I hope to hear much more Band on Sunday afternoon . . . I await to hear other opinions.’

Redruth Reformatory.

Five girls escaped from the Redruth Reformatory on the night of 14 September and have been recaptured. Two were found by John Sandland at Norman Farm east of Burra. Two turned up on The Gums Station on the Eastern Plains last Thursday in a starving condition and Mr Pearse kindly returned them in a buggy after feeding and nursing and a day’s rest. On Monday the fifth was brought back by Mr Robert McBride who found her wandering on the travelling track in Baldina District.

Mr & Mrs McCulloch’s Farewell is reported in 13⁄4 columns. Owing to the disposal of Princess Royal they have decided to live in Adelaide. The Mayor, Mr E.W. Crewes, presided. Mr McCulloch had done a great many acts of kindness in the district over many years. When the property was known to be on the market many had hoped that Mr McCulloch would see his way clear to purchase it, but he had not done so. His generosity to the poor was well known. He had donated several large amounts to the Burra Benevolent Soc. An illuminated address was presented.

Mr P. Lane referred to the excellent work done in the town in the early days by Mr McCulloch Sen. and was glad to say that his son had followed to a considerable degree in his footsteps.

Dr Sangster Sen. too spoke along similar lines. Mrs McCulloch would also be missed by the children especially who received such hospitality at Princess Royal on their picnics. The [Anglican] Church was free [of debt] today due largely to Mr McCulloch’s generosity.

Rev. W.G.M. Murphy added his best wishes and referred to the large and beautiful memorial window in the church which would ever remind them of Mr & Mrs McCulloch.

Mr W. West Sen. endorsed these remarks.

Mr McCulloch said he was glad to see so many friends present. McCullochs had been associated with Burra for over 50 years – since his father had migrated. He had left Perthshire in 1838. He was offered the management of a sheep station by Mr Henry Dundas Murray, a son of Sir William Murray of Ochtertyre. They came on the ship Orliana and landed at Holdfast Bay after a voyage of five months. His father had married just before migrating. They took their household good to Adelaide on a dray with two bullocks and pitched a tent on the block where Faulding’s Chemist now stands. Mr Murray decided to go on to NSW and Tasmania before settling on a property. McCulloch decided to take up a run on the Gilbert River in about 1842 and shortly after took up Elderotrilla Run. Later they went to live at Gottlieb’s [Near Terowie] and so were in constant touch with Burra. His father represented the Burra District [in Parliament] in 1867. He, the speaker, had spent a very pleasant stay in the district as had Mrs McCulloch. He still had an interest in runs in the north and would sometimes visit the Burra Market. The new owner of Princess Royal, Mr Tennant, comes from New Zealand and intends to be a resident owner. He hoped Mr Tennant might open some of the copper lodes on the property.

The meeting ended with Auld Lang Syne and God Save the Queen.

Burra Defence Rifle Club held its half-yearly meeting at the Commercial Hotel on 22 October with the President, Mr Page, in the chair. The treasurer, Mr J.A. Pearce, reported a credit balance of £12. In the half-year six trophy matches had been fired and there were contests with Watervale, Renmark, Clare, Kapunda, Port Pirie and Orroroo which showed the energetic efforts of the President and committee. A match against Kapunda will be fired on 31 October.

Burra Flower Show was held on Wednesday at the Institute. There were no money prizes, but 1st and 2nd prize tickets were awarded. The weather was not very conducive to a good display, but there were over 300 entries. Old exhibitors did well and the names of Oppermann, Baker and Fuss were frequent and a number of young competitors were also evident. Attendance was not so large as would have been liked, but was sufficient to make ends meet. Results are printed.

Baldina Methodist Church. The new church was opened last Sunday when Rev. W.G. Clarke preached. The public meeting on Monday was crowded. The building cost £125 in cash and labour and there is an outstanding debt of £20. [This refers to the stone building which replaced an iron building: the former was known as the Tin Pot Church and there is a reference to the new church as the Stone Jug Church by comparison.]

Burra Waterworks. When the water was cut off to test the boiler on Thursday a hole was discovered which required immediate repair. Water was restored on Saturday.

Ratepayer writes that the government is asking the Council to take over a seven year lease on the Waterworks. This would be reckless for such a ‘tin pot affair’. It is impossible to keep on with such a ramshackle affair any longer and impossible to get decent water from the present well. It is time to voice your concern at the ratepayers’ meeting. [This meeting was scheduled for 16 November in an advertisement on the same page.]

Burra Racing Club has been registered again and the SAJC has granted 30 June for the meeting.

Cricket. Burra was defeated at Clare on Monday by an innings and 3 runs.

Editorial on the retiring Council which has worked well together, done what was needed and finished with a credit balance in every department! The waterworks account is in a flourishing state with a credit balance of £341. The editor feels however that the cemetery is a disgrace and the coming year should see money spent on it. The slaughterhouse question is hanging fire and this too should be attended to, though here the fault lies as much with those who framed the by-laws. The town is generally looking good and the sanitary condition is excellent.

The Mayor, E.W. Crewes, has agreed to stand again.

Mr A.C. Noyes, music teacher in the town for many years, has been told to take a trip for his health and has decided to go to England on Saturday.

The SAR. The other night on the train between Hamley Bridge and Stockport two or three ne’er-do-wells accosted M-C Jemison and teased him endlessly on the assumption he was a ‘cocky’ and ended by becoming abusive and taking undue liberties. Just before Riverton the officer telegraphed to M-C Queale and on arrival there the ringleader, named Thomas Hill, was arrested and next day fined £1 + costs.

Shortridge as an honorarium for services rendered. The Burra Football Assoc. balance sheet was also presented and adopted. The absence of delegates or members from the Aberdeen Club was noted and regretted.

The Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting was held last Friday, but evoked little interest and a small attendance. Mr J. Sampson presided. E.W. Crewes reported the last year.

The year started in credit £24-7-0 and the present credit is £42-4-1, but with several important works continuing little will remain by the year’s end. The assessed value for 1900 is £35-12-8 less than in 1899 (Total £8,507-9-0). North Ward lamps cost £7-14-0 and in West and East Wards the cost was £4-17-6 each. [This suggests two lamps in North Ward: one at the Royal Exchange corner, but where was the other?]

The cemetery began in credit £46-5-0 and is now £36-2-4. Vandalism has been a problem, but the names of offenders have been obtained and steps taken to prevent a recurrence.

Last year the meeting of ratepayers on the Waterworks issue resolved that the Council should continue to control the Waterworks and carry on as cheaply as possible. The approach to the Government for a reduction in the capital account and the rate of interest was rejected and now the Government wants the Council to take on a seven year lease. At present the Council is retaining possession as monthly tenants. The Council resolved some months ago to hand the works to the Government at the end of the year. Two months ago the Council asked the Government to send an expert to test the boiler as they feared its condition. Last week this was done and several defective plates needed immediate attention. Repairs were carried out in one day. While he was here the expert was asked about the small boiler and this is now being put in a state of repair to carry on while the Cornish boiler is being repaired. In the future there will not have to be a stoppage just because the large boiler requires maintenance work.

Health.

This year there were a few cases of typhoid, but it soon departed. The new Board of Health Regulations require the town to have a Public Slaughterhouse in which all meat sold in the town is slaughtered and inspected. A public meeting was called to decide on sanctioning a loan to build a new slaughterhouse or whether the old one, known as O’Leary’s, should be secured. The latter course was selected. D. & J. O’Leary consented to surrender their lease and Council is now waiting on SAMA to grant a lease on the slaughterhouse for seven years with the right of renewal for a rental of £27. The Council is anxious to have this completed.

The Slaughterhouse issue was the most troublesome for the year. Twelve months ago he had thought the Waterworks a white elephant and that they should be handed over to the Government. This year’s experience had proved them not to be in such a bad state. The water supply was adequate, though he would not comment on the quality. He was not now in favour of handing back the works. Recently the Government had bought a great deal of water and the payment for this would cover nicely the cost of boiler repairs.

Mr C. Fuss moved the adoption of the report. Carried.

Cr West said he was glad Council had gone in for tar dressing footpaths and hoped it would be continued where necessary.

Messrs J. Ford and J. Sampson said they were candidates for East Ward. Cr West will stand again for West Ward. North Ward has as yet no candidate.

J. Sampson then handed the chair to C. Fuss.

The Mayor said that though he would stand again he would be happy to stand aside if anyone would offer to stand.

J. Sampson said he would like to see further tar dressing and the road to the cemetery made and trees planted along it to the cemetery gates.

Court.

Richard Gully was charged with assaulting Thomas Rodda James Reynolds at Aberdeen on 24 October. Several witnesses, friends of Gully, told stories in which they claimed to have seen what had happened. They were generally so unbelievable that the bench clearly thought them guilty of perjury and contempt of court. Gully was fined £1-10-0 plus costs amounting in all to £5.

Burra Town Council.

There is a report from the Crown Lands Office that the decking timber on the Commercial St Bridge is all more or less decayed.

Burra Slag Extraction Co. In a terrible accident on Monday night E. McCann was caught in the rollers. His left foot was caught and torn from his leg: the boot and part of his foot going between the rollers. He was at once taken to the hospital where his left foot was amputated about three inched above the ankle. He is progressing as well as can be expected. Mr McCann was only recently married.

Dr Brummitt’s holiday notes Part XVII: The Woman’s Exhibition at Earl’s Court.

Weather. Last Sunday [1 December] a heavy thunderstorm struck Burra with a great deluge of rain and much damage was dome in some parts of town. The bridge over the creek opposite the Kooringa Post Office was washed away as was the one between Mitchell’s Flat and Lower Thames St. [The Pig and Whistle crossing] Some houses were flooded. The top metal was removed from some roads. The Burra Creek ran a banker though the heavy rain lasted only 11⁄2 hours and was followed by light showers. In F. Harris’s shop the water caused bags of lime to ignite. Fortunately the fire was quickly extinguished. Water rushed into Mr Hiddle’s house Messrs Urwin & Sons had water all through the shop and damage to silks and satins from an overflowing parapet gutter. Damage was estimated at £10. The fall was 2.41”.

The flood almost covered the bridge near Reed’s at the north end of town.

Mr Allen and family were flooded out of their home [The Bushman’s Rest] and sought refuge at the Court House hotel. Mr Gully and family also fled. The footbridge near J.R. Gray’s was carried under a larger one and placed against a third near the Court House.

Market Square was generally under water. Water got into Drew & Crewe’s cellar, but the sugar had been raised on stands.

T.P. Halls went to Baldina in his cab and had to wait over three hours for the water level at Baldina Ford to drop and then only got through with a drenching.

Messrs Gray’s and Bentley’s houses were swamped.

Damage to crops was considerable and William Finch, south of Kooringa saw the total destruction of his crop. [The next issue corrects this, saying his crop was saved.]

Rejoicing went on far into the night.

Tenders are called for painting the seats and mortuary at the cemetery.

Market Square pump is to be repaired.

It has been decided to continue leasing the Burra Waterworks on the same basis as now. [From the Mayor’s annual report this would mean as monthly tenants.]

Characteristics of the paper in 1900.

The paper was little different from 1899.

U.X.L. continued to provide a serial.

Early in the year there was considerable padding as for example on 31 January when there was a whole column of jokes and half a column of household hints.

What were apparent stories turned out sometimes to be disguised advertisements.

‘Night’s horrid Plague’ that keeps thousands awake and made life a misery, turned out to be ‘protruding or outward piles’ for which Doan’s Ointment was the answer, as it was for eczema, hives, sores, chilblains, insect bites, etc.

In all the paper was very uneven doing well at times and on some issues, but missing on others and not following up on some.

Editorial comment was generally missing.

Page 1

Large advertisements mainly not local.

Page 2

Mixture of large and small advertisements. Some are not local. Sales and public notices and news mixed with long wordy advertisements. Serial may be here or page 3.

Page 3

Mixture of long wordy advertisements for patent cures and local news.

Page 4

Large advertisements for local businesses and patent cures with some smaller advertisements of mixed origins.

The year began with Volume XV Number 398 on 3 January 1900

And continued to Volume XV Number 447 on 19 December 1900

428 was used twice and 429 was not used.

436 was used twice.

Burra High School – Bleak House: Report of the Principal, Annie B. Millar

Miss Bertha and I will return to re-open the school on 30 January. The brightest experience this year was the successful result of Vera Wilkinson’s preliminary examination and the saddest was the passing of Miss Davidson. Rev. Wilfred Murphy continues his excellent scripture lessons. Vera Wilkinson is dux of the school with Zoe Sangster second.

The prize list and concert items are printed.

## Burra Boxing Day Sports were held at Victoria Park. The day started hot and windy, but was cooler later and the gate was £41-5-0, down only £7 on last year and was regarded as very satisfactory. Cycling was the main draw.

The event of the day was the Burra Wheel Race over 2 miles. The winner got £13 with the 2nd place £4, 3rd £2 and 4th £1. Won by J. Bailey.

The pedestrian events were also well contested, though not as well as previously and the public was clearly less interested in these than in the cycling and indulged in other pastimes during them. There was a successful concert in the Institute in the evening.

Christmas in Burra.

On Christmas Eve the streets were crowded and the shops were decorated with seasonable goods. The Burra Band made proceedings lively. Music was played till about 10.15 and then the Band played carols in various parts of the town from about 11.15 to 4.30 a.m. Christmas morning. Christmas Day passed quietly without sports in Burra, but Boxing Day saw the United Friendly Societies’ Sports, and the Salvation Army’s Boat Service in the Barracks was a great success. Thursday was also a holiday, but nothing formal was arranged. On 28 December Burra cricketers went to Saddleworth where they were defeated by a few runs. [Scores not printed.]

Kooringa Methodist Church will celebrate Hospital Sunday next Sunday. The Burra Band will lead the procession and Friendly Societies will attend.

Obituary. Mrs Drake, widow of the late H.J. Drake, was singeing a goose about 11 a.m. when her dress caught fire. Her daughter managed to extinguish the flames by wrapping her in the covering from the sofa, but the burns resulted in her death about 3.20 p.m. She apparently ran about the room when the accident occurred because the curtains on the safe and cupboards, carpet, tablecloth, a mangle and a loaf of bread were also burnt or damaged. It is amazing the house was saved. Mrs Drake was a resident for 44 years, arriving in SA in 1850 and in 1857 marrying Mr Drake at St Luke’s Adelaide. They then came to Burra where Mr Drake died in 1871 at the age of 39. Mrs Drake then kept a boarding house. She leaves two sons; Francis Henry (married) Mayor of Port Wakefield and Robert. There is also a daughter, Emily. [Born Maria Marshall: died 25 December 1900 aged 64]

A New ‘Sunshine’ Harvester was given a working field trial on R. Field’s farm on Wednesday before about 55 farmers. The day was cold and the straw damp. It was also windy and the crop heavy and in places badly knocked down. The machine performed very well. It strips, winnows, screens and bags in one operation. It was here worked by four horses, though three are more common, and controlled by one man. The farmers present were most impressed by its action.

James Gully was charged with having a bag of uncleaned wheat which might reasonably be suspected of having been stolen or unlawfully obtained. Police alleged he took it from L. Gebhardt’s paddock and placed it on or adjacent to the railway line. Gully said he ‘found’ it on the line when running the length in his work. The acting ganger said finds on the line should be taken to the station.

William Manamly, a railway packer, reported seeing the bag adjacent to the line and reported it to his foreman, but didn’t know what the latter did.

Gully said while patrolling the line on Monday he saw the bag on ‘the Queen’s highway’ and threw it over the railway fence. He said he expected to hear someone enquire about it, but nothing happened so on Friday I sent my boy (Ben) to get it. Gully claimed not to know where the boy had put it till M-C Phelan pointed it out to him. Bought it two miles towards Burra on the tricycle. He did not report it as it was not found on railway property. The bench found that though the amount was trifling the offence was serious and that Gully was guilty. They decided on a lenient fine of 5/- plus costs of 15/-. Mr Winnall said there would be an appeal and payment of the fine was deferred.

XV, 452, 30 Jan. 1901, page 3

Edde Collins [sic] writes a rebuttal of Mr Edward’s letter of 6 February re the price for gravelling roads at Mt Bryan.

Mr Edwards has not earned 14/- a day at this contract, as he leads people to believe. I don’t believe A.E. has made 3/6 a day (horses and dray given in). He took a contract for 10 chains at 9/- a chain gravelling and took 91⁄2 days over it. Why was the tenderer not kept up to scratch? One contract near Mr Bowman’s sheep station is a disgrace, using inferior stuff. I will work alongside A.E., same hours and earn quite as much as himself, if not more, any time he likes to mention it. All I want is a fair day’s work for a fair day’s pay.

[The editor says he had to exercise considerable discretion in eliminating a considerable portion of this letter.]

Surprise arrests in town. On Saturday evening Thomas Fairchild reported a pig was missing, believed stolen. On information gathered M-Cs Jemison & Phelan went to Aaron Woodman of George St with little satisfaction and then, after further enquiries, to the house of Julius Lehman. After further investigation both men were arrested and charged with the theft of the pig. As a couple of sheepskins from McBride’s ‘Norman Farm’ were found at Lehman’s more serious charges are likely to follow. This has created a sensation in town as both were known as hard-working men. Lehman, aged 30, worked for the Unicorn Brewery and Woodman, aged 29, was a road contractor. Both are married with families.

Redruth Court.

The place was packed to hear the case of Aaron Woodman & Julius Lehman who were charged with stealing sheep and a pig.

Lehman was charge with theft of a pig and two stud sheep the property of Robert Martin McBride.

There is lengthy evidence concerned with identifying the animals concerned and dating their disappearance.

Lehman claimed he had been much unemployed and to have taken the sheep on Woodman’s suggestion and urging, to feed his family.

Woodman was conjointly charged and also with stealing a pig, the property of Thomas Fairchild.

Woodman admitted to police he had shot the pig and had given half of it to Lehman.

As with Lehman he claimed that debts and lack of food for his family had led to this.

Both were committed for trial at the Supreme Court.

Mr Jeffrey has 20 students in his wool-sorting classes and will also give a lecture on wool at the Institute on Tuesday evening next.

Attempted Arson.

On Tuesday 5 March an attempt was made to burn down Drew & Co.’s (late Drew & Crewe’s) and Mr J. Snell’s premises. Kerosene was poured under the door of the drapery section, but so closely does the door fit with the flagged floor that little of it penetrated. The wood of the door was charred and numerous matches had been used to try to set it alight. It is thought to have been attempted between 1 & 2 a.m. on a moonlight night.

Kerosene had also been poured over the board threshold and boards leading to it, of Mr Snell’s shop. Again despite the amount of wood there the fire failed to gain a hold. M-C Jemison had been called to Clare on Tuesday night, a fact no doubt known to the arsonist.

M-C Phelan was contacted and took action to trace the arsonist. A blacktracker was sent for and arrived Wednesday morning. Tracks in the vicinity of C. Grow’s stables led to Thomas Byrne’s house in Thames St. There was at first insufficient evidence, but Byrne was arrested on Thursday morning. The case lasted from11 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. and will be reported next issue.

Redruth Court. The Arson Case.

Evidence was given of the discovery of the damage in the morning.

E.W. Crewes said he had seen on the evening of 5 March at about 11.20 p.m. the ‘woman known as Mrs Byrne . . . standing at Luke Day’s corner.’

Then came much evidence from various witnesses about the kerosene and matches and the failure of the fire to take hold.

M-C Phelan later visited C. Grow and found that the cushions in his cab had been saturated with kerosene. Also from the cab he got an empty bottle that had held kerosene. Fresh footprints from the cab were covered up by M-C Phelan and in the evening in company with M-C Jemison, Thomas Byrne was found to have kerosene on his coat. When asked to provide the shoes he had worn on Tuesday night Byrne claimed to have thrown them away as they were hurting him. Byrne was then arrested.

Annie Morrison, who lived with the Byrnes, said Byrne had come home about 11.30 on Tuesday and then had coat and boots and no kerosene on the coat. They went to their separate beds and she did not hear him go out again, but thought she heard him come in later – did not get up. In the morning she smelt kerosene on his clothing, but received no answer to he question about the kerosene on the clothes.

When M-C Jemison asked about it he said it had been thrown by a silly fellow: Tommy Tighe.

Thomas Tighe, of Pulsford Rd, Prospect, Adelaide, said he had been in Burra, but left on the Wednesday. On Tuesday Byrne had wanted him to do a sword dance, but he would not. Byrne said get some kerosene to burn down a shop in Kooringa, but he would not. He did not throw any kerosene over Byrne.

Eliz. Jemison gave evidence that Tighe spent the night in question in the police station at Kooringa in the cell – was asleep at 10 p.m. with no kerosene on his clothes.

Thomas Halls confirmed the pair’s movements earlier in the day and generally Tighe’s evidence.

Benjamin J. Bourman, ostler at the Commercial Hotel gave evidence suggesting that the kerosene was probably taken from the hotel’s lamp room. The supply there running out four days before it should have.

Blacktracker Tommy King gave evidence of the tracks and where they led.

XV, 459, 20 Mar. 1901, page 3

Jemison then gave evidence about how the trail had been followed to Byrne. The tracks had led down Bridge St from Grow’s, across the footbridge and into Chapel St near Vivian’s stables [Commercial Hotel] and thence to Charles Park’s store opposite Drew & Crewes’ store.

Byrne blamed his lack of memory of the day in question on ‘drinking very heavy on colonial wine from Saturday till Thursday morning’. He denied any motive for such an act, but could not rightly remember much of the days in question and believed someone had poured kerosene on him. He was committed for trial at the next criminal proceedings.

Burra Slag Extraction Co.

F.W. Holder, Sir J.W. Downer, Hon. L. O’Loughlin (Commissioner of Crown Lands), Hon. J.V. O’Loughlin MLC, and forty local residents paid a visit to the Burra Slag Extraction Works to witness the operation thereof. They had been invited by J.F. Martin and were met by the manager, M. May.

Erection of the machinery began in 1899. After many difficulties the cost of the plant reached £8,000 and later modifications have added at least another £4,000 due to the unusual hardness of the slag. Although it was being successful the process was too slow and additions were needed to double the output. Now 700 to 800 tons a week is treated in three shifts of men to produce a concentrate assaying 70-80% copper and leaving between 0.125% and 0.25% copper in the tailings. About a quarter of the heap has been treated so far and it is expected work may continue for another 4 years. The works employ about 40 plus the teamsters carting wood. The plant requires about 7-8 tons daily. Trucks carrying about 4 cwt are hauled up every few minutes – about 215 a day. The lighting at night is by five electric arc lamps of 15,000 candlepower each. Copper already treated and stored in a heap is valued at £800-£900. A few pieces weighed several pounds, but most of it was in small pieces from gunshot size to pea size. A small concentrating plant is nearing completion and this will take ore from tributers who are getting too small an amount to justify sending it away for concentration. After the visit refreshments were served. There were speeches all round and toasts.

Burra Defence Rifle Club had a match on 9 & 13 March and H. Scott won from G. Herbert & A. Riggs. [But it is not clear how the handicap limit applied to affect this result.]

XV, 460, 27 Mar. 1901, page 2-3

Annie Howell’s Court Case is reported in over four columns. [Apparently mainly for its entertainment value.] Heard before T.W. Wilkinson & A. Harris JPs.

Annie Howell was charged with seeking to rescue one grey horse, one spring dray and a set of single harness, which had been seized by the bailiff – also charged was her husband, John Howell.

Mrs Howell objected to the case being heard as her witnesses were absent.

R.L. Giles, bailiff:

On 12 January went to Mongolata to execute two warrants – one for £7-16-6 and the other for 15-12-6. The Howells refused to hear the warrants or to pay up.

(Annie interrupted to say they had the Attorney General’s advice not to pay.)

On attempting to seize the horse Mrs Howell said it belongs to John Howell. The second warrant was for John Howell and he said the horse belongs to Mr Barker. The debt is in consequence of a court verdict in 1898.

Howell said he would rather go to jail than pay.

The bailiff had then seized the items as above.

The bailiff then claimed that Mrs Howell urged her husband to get a gun and shoot them and then get an axe and kill the horse – stick them with a knife.

Mrs Howell continually interrupted the evidence with dramatic gestures and exclamations of denial and was ultimately threatened with removal to the back of the court.

The bailiff offered to go to Mr Barker’s to ascertain the ownership of the horse – Mrs Howell insisted on accompanying him, riding with the two bailiffs in their buggy. Howell followed with the dray.

On the way they stopped at Mr Jones’s at Mongolata and at his invitation had dinner. Mrs Howell objected that she was left in the trap all the while. After dinner the bailiff found that the Howells had gone off in the dray. They followed the dray tracks into the hills and found Mrs Howell sitting in the dray in the ranges. Mrs Howell interrupted to say it was on a three chain road short cut to Barker’s. They went on and near Barker’s met with Howell coming back to say that Barker was not home. The bailiffs decided to go into Burra. Mrs Howell tried to eject the assistant bailiff from the dray and Howell seized the horse and tried to unfasten the reins.

Mr W. Moore, who had been picked up at Jones’s and was the son of E.A. Moore, the assistant bailiff, helped to restrain Howell who then rushed to the side of the horse and tried to unfasten the trace.

Mrs Howell suggested they go to see Mrs Barker and examine Mr Barker’s cheque book [as evidence of his ownership of the horse.]

They went to Mr Barker’s where Mr Giles ordered Mr Moore to drive the dray to Burra. Howell again tried to unfasten the reins. W. Moore then held Howell while the dray was driven off and Moore then made a run for the trap with Giles and they drive off with Howell heaving a large stone at them.

The cross examination by the Howells was dramatic and rather frenetic and in the end profitless for them.

E.A. Moore, the assistant bailiff gave evidence confirming that of Giles, the bailiff and W. Moore’s evidence was corroborative.

Mrs Howell said she was in bed very, very ill on 12 January and got up when Giles arrived.

She claimed ‘They have taken all I had . . . By burning me out and taking me to court.’

(Clarified after objection – that the ‘they’ of the burning were in fact unknown.)

She claimed that Giles had insisted on her going with them to Baker’s [whereas his evidence had her insisting on coming along.]

M-C Jemison, who was acting as court recorder complained that he couldn’t keep up with either the dramatics of Mrs Howell or the objections of Mr Winnall. ‘I don’t know who is the biggest nuisance Mr Winnall or the defendant.’

After an amusing discussion about the absent witnesses, none of whom except the Barker girls had actually seen any of the critical actions, the case ended having given four hours of entertainment for the gallery.

The bench found the Howells guilty and fined them £1 + £4-8-0 costs.

Mr Winnall – What about the non-payment of the fine?

Bench – Can you pay the money?

Mrs Howell – No we can’t.

Bench – One month to pay or 14 days in jail.

Mrs Howell – ‘Do you arrest me now; take me as I am.’

‘The crowd left the Court feeling that they had been highly entertained.’

Burra Rifle Defence Club. Annual meeting on Wednesday at the Commercial Hotel. W. B. Page, President, took the chair. There was a credit balance of £5-9-4. Elections for the next year resulted in: President, A.B. Hiddle; Secretary, J.A. Pearce; Treasurer, C.A. Pearce. Annual subscriptions were set at 6/- payable half-yearly.

Best average for the year 1900-01 was R.D. Pascoe with 76 over 19 matches followed by C. Parks with 74 over 19 and J.A. Pearce with 73 over 23.

There were 55 members and 37 members completed class firing for the year. This resulted in there being 5 marksmen, 2 first class shots, 3 second class shots and 27 third class shots. This is not altogether satisfactory.

There were 9 matches with outside clubs of which Burra won 6 and lost 3.

Local club matches for donated prizes were welcomed and their donors thanked.

The SADR Clubs Association was formed some time ago, but has had little benefit and membership of it seems of doubtful value. The Government’s £400 for class firing among the military forces excludes Defence Rifle Clubs which the President described as grossly unfair. The clubs were also excluded from the celebrations of the opening of the Federal Parliament. We hope for better things from the new Commonwealth.

Editorial on the Alfred Stanley Lines Case

The editor comments on a recent court case in which Henry Skews was charged with beating Alfred Stanley Lines. The editor says, that without in any way condoning the actions of Skews, it is clear he was provoked sorely by the actions of a lad who is either self-willed or takes a delight in doing what is wrong and has an immovable conscience. Nevertheless, orphans and other boys in the care of masters should not be knocked about, because two wrongs do not make a right.

[Note that Alfred Stanley Lines, born 6 April 1885, was orphaned in 1855 when his father murdered his mother and then committed suicide. See VI, 449, 16 June 1885, Page 3.]

Redruth Court, 10 April

Thomas Rosewall & Albert May were each fined 10/- + 10/- costs for drunkenness and the use of ‘choice Billingsgate’ at the World’s End Sports.

Frederick Sellars was fined 10/- + 10/- costs for interfering with police on the same occasion.

Frederick Camp was charged on the information of his wife with having assaulted her on 4 April.

Mrs Camp claimed he was drunk and struck her knocking out two teeth. He hands were also injured in the struggle. He also assaulted their son George who had come to his mother’s aid.

Frederick Camp strongly denied all this.

George Camp’s evidence supported his mother.

Frederick Camp said his wife was drunk and had attacked him, dragging him by his whiskers and scratching his face. He was fined £2, but with court fees of 13/-, attorney fees of £1-1-0 and informant fee of 5/-[and presumably other costs] he was in total parted from £4-11-0.

Henry Skews was fined 10/- plus costs amounting in all to £3-5-6 when he was charged with assaulting Alfred Stanley Lines at Booborowie on 26 March with a pick handle. Lines claimed £5 compensation. Lines gave evidence saying Skews hit him with a pick handle and also struck him on the chin and temple with his fist tore his shirt from his back and scratched his chest. He had also caught him and dragged him by his ears. Skews said Lines had got into his house and stolen items. Lines admitted entering the house, but only to get some sugar. Lines did admit taking a bridle and then destroying another by cutting a bit out of it because ‘it looked better on the other bridle’. He then tried to repair the damaged bridle by cutting up a coupling used for the horses. When questioned, Lines admitted to a whole series of failures to carry out instructions. Each in itself was a relatively minor thing, but they clearly had a cumulative effect. Skews admitted the assault, but not the use of a pick handle.

The Bench conceded the provocation, but said it did not justify Skews taking the law into his own hands and assaulting the lad.

David Alexander Stewart was found drunk on three days within a week and as a result was sentenced to 24 hours imprisonment on Wednesday, fined 5/- on Thursday and fined £1 on the following Monday.

Advt. A Grand Display of Fireworks at Victoria Park on Friday Evening 19 April.

Court.

Two men have been taken to Adelaide by M-C Phelan in the past week for being repeatedly drunk: David Maxwell Stewart, after his fourth conviction in a week, and Fred. Camp.

Mrs Howell went at the same time following her failure to pay the fine resulting from the recent case. Mr Howell has paid his fine and promises a sensational trial for false imprisonment in his wife’s case.

Kooringa Court.

Berno Frederick [sic: but probably Beno Isaac Frederick born 29 March 1882 at Copperhouse to August & Maria.] was charged with being the alleged father of the unborn child of Maud Lines, a girl at the Redruth Reformatory and under the age of 18 years. James Gray, Inspector for the State Children’s council asked for maintenance and confinement expenses. As it happened the pregnancy could not be confirmed and the case was dismissed.

William McDonald was charged with being the father of the unborn child of Charlotte Sarah Campbell, living in Kooringa with Mrs Goldsworthy. M-C Jemison said that when told that ‘Lottie Goldsworthy’ was in trouble McDonald said ‘others have been there as well as me’ and refused to sign any order for expenses. In court McDonald denied any wrong doing with the girl absolutely and denied he had admitted anything to M-C Jemison. Others gave evidence that she was frequently out with other young men and wore ‘a very short dress – nearly up to her knees’. The case was dismissed with costs against the State School Council of £3-6-6.

St Mary’s Vestry Meeting.

The meeting heard that the Sunday school was flourishing and the parish’s Mission Churches were doing well. The church had received gifts: an eagle lectern from Mr & Mrs A. McCulloch, silver side vessels from Mr & Mrs C. Sandland, a new Bible from Mr & Mrs W.P. Barker, a velvet alms bag from Mrs J.E.H. Winnall.

The last strawberry fete raised £105 and £70 of it went to the organ fund. The rest went to lay water to the rectory and to erect a fence between the church and the Sunday school. Weekly services were conducted at the Hospital and Redruth Reformatory. This year’s strawberry fete funds are to be used as follows: £10 to the organ fund, to plaster the Sunday school room, to renovate and clean the interior of the church and the rest on a shelter shed.

Polo. A polo team from Adelaide visited on Saturday last which was rather rainy. The report is hard to follow especially given sentences like ‘In the third quarter Burra secured the second and only goal for the day’.

[Both sides had previously been credited with a goal: Adelaide in the first quarter and Burra in the second.]

The final result seems to have been that Adelaide 6 defeated Burra 2.

Entertainment. The Lady of Carthage will be presented at the Institute in costume tonight. It is the story of the Martyrdom of SS Vivia Perpetua and Felicitas. Proceeds are for a worthy object. [Both the worthy object and the producers of the effort are unnamed here, but an advertisement elsewhere on page 3 says the profits will go to St Mary’s Sunday school.]

He was born in London in June 1817 and left there 26 September 1848 in the Candahar, arriving at Pt Adelaide 10 February 1849.

In February 1852 he went to the Victorian goldfields where he spent a year at Forest Creek and Bendigo before returning to Burra. In 1853 he joined the Burra Lodge MUIOOF and was active in it for many years, being financial secretary for 14 years from June 1854. He then visited England. He never married and his only relative in Australia is Mr George Thomas Wells of NSW.

Mr Holder’s Banquet was given at the Institute on 13 May by the electors. The Hall was decorated with flags, mottos, ferns, pot plants etc. Mottos were Advance Australia, Success to Federation and God Save the King. 150 guests were served by R. Paddock of the Bon Accord with many waiters. E.W. Crewes, Mayor, was in the chair, but his role was largely usurped innovation [or as the paper says ‘the new innovation’] of a toastmaster. The affair was ‘certainly the most brilliant ever witnessed in Burra’.

Present with the Premier were:

Mr & Mrs E.W. Crewes

Hon. W.B. Rounsevell MP

Hon. E. Lucas MLC

Captain Humphris DSO

Hon. J.G. Jenkins, Chief Secretary

J.H. Gordon, Attorney General

L. O’Loughlin, Commissioner of Crown Lands

Hon. E.L. Batchelor

Dr Sangster Sen.

Rev. W.G. Clarke

The Mayor said Mr Holder had represented Burra District for 14 years and was held in the highest esteem. He had known Mr Holder for 24 years. He remembered his entry into politics and had watched him in turn become, a private member, Commissioner of Crown Lands, Treasurer and Premier. He went on the thank him and wish him well in his new position as Speaker of the House of Representatives.

L. O’Loughlin spoke in glowing terms of Holder’s role in Australian politics.

The Minister of Education praised Mr Holder’s ‘spotless character’.

Dr Sangster gave a neat little speech in supporting the toast and others followed.

Holder in reply was visibly moved and recounted his political journey over the last 14 years and expressed his wonder at 24,000 voting for him at the Federal Convention and 37,000 for Federal Parliament. He had come to Burra 22 years ago and felt like a stranger for a very short time and was glad not to have had to change seats to stay in Parliament. His role was not to serve just the district, but to make SA prosperous and for this reason he stoutly opposed protective duties and tried to amend the land laws. He had found economics easy to talk about, but hard to achieve as the electorate favoured economy in principle, but not in practice. He was glad to have made some headway in progressive taxation. He feared the creeping power of the Federal Government at the expense of the states and hoped SA would resist.

Mr C. Fuss proposed ‘The Ministry’ and Hon. J.G. Jenkins responded, and amid other remarks said of Holder: ‘No one could point to a blemish on his character.’

Hon. J.H. Gordon said of Holder: ‘never in the stress of the fight in political battles had he heard Mr Holder’s lips towards his colleagues give one word of reproach or one word which could be construed into one of unkindness’.

He also lauded as one of Holder’s strengths his ‘unassuming modesty’.

T. Queale proposed ‘The Parliament’.

Hon. W.B. Rounsevell praised Holder’s ability, statesmanship and sweet reasonableness.

Hon. E. Lucas replied for the Legislative Council and Mr Coneybeer MP also spoke.

Mr W.G. Martin proposed: ‘The Army & Navy’, to which Captain Humphris, Mayor of Jamestown, responded.

Mr W.E. [or F?] Mounster proposed: ‘The Ladies’ and Mr West replied.

Rev. Father Redden proposed: ‘The Press’, whose representatives responded.

A vote of thanks and Auld Lang Syne concluded the proceedings.

The editor appends a paragraph bitterly resentful of the rudeness that saw the representatives of the two city dailies called on to respond rather than the local press representative. This was an infringement of common courtesy and bad because of the local editor’s close connection with Mr Holder.

Obituary. Ambrose Harris has died. He was born 1 Dec. 1826 in the parish of St Nest, Cornwall and arrived in SA in the Sultana on 8 Aug. 1854. He worked in the Burra Mine and helped to build Schneider’s Engine House. In Feb. 1853 he went to the Victorian diggings and remained for 12 months. He returned to Adelaide and worked as a stonemason, returning to Burra in 1856 and worked again at the mine until 1867 after which he worked on various Government contracts until 1885. He then joined with Mr James Launder and worked around Burra till 1895, since when he has not been able to do heavy work. A severe coach accident in 1872 broke his leg and gave him other serious injuries which have affected him ever since. He resided in Kooringa for upwards of 45 years and celebrated his golden wedding on 24 April 1901. He leaves a widow and one son, B.G. Harris of Kalgoorlie, and four daughters: Mrs R.H. Steele, Mrs Charles Parks, Miss E.J. Harris of Kooringa and 11 grandchildren. He was a member of the Burra Lodge MUIOOF since 1859 and also of the Wesleyan Church. [Died 22 May 1901 aged 74]

The dray was hired from Penn & Co. of Adelaide, which Gurr had stated. Since there was no case to answer J.P. Snow SM took a dim view and awarded 6/- costs for the day’s wages lost.

H.W. Collins sued J. Harris for travelling through his property on a stock route without notice. As Harris had been doing this for years without complaint from Collins, it was suggested the case resulted from some disagreement between the two. Mr Pendlebury, for Harris, managed to show the route was a public road and had been maintained, at least in part, by the DC. Collins was unable to prove ownership of the land and ended up having to pay £2-16-0 costs to Harris.

Burra coursing Club held a preliminary meeting at the Commercial Hotel last week. A meeting will be held on 17 & 18 July. Mr Hiddle presided and J.A. Pearce was appointed secretary pro tem. The meeting will be held at Gum Creek on the property of J.J. Duncan.

Children’s Peace Demonstration Committee was offered 6d per head last year by the Government for those children participating in the ‘Peace Day’ to be proclaimed. But now there is no peace and the Government offer has been withdrawn. The Committee has been rather embarrassed. To keep faith the demonstration was held on Monday and was very successful. At 11 a.m. the children assembled at Market Square, from Burra, Baldina, World’s End, Thistlebeds, Leighton, Gum Creek, Hanson, Stony Gap and Copperhouse State Schools and from Miss Millar’s, Miss Bentley’s and St Joseph’s private schools – totalling almost 700 in all. There were addresses by the Mayor, E.W. Crewes, Rev. Father Reddan and Rev. W.F. James. They sang the National Anthem and then marched to Victoria Park where lunch was followed by sports. There were refreshments a little before 4 p.m. and departure shortly after.

The afternoon service of song was War for Christ. Congregations were large and collections well in advance, though wet weather cut attendance at Monday’s tea meeting.

Income for the year was £81-17-0 and expenditure £84-13-6. £30 was paid off the debt and the trust debt stands at £149. There are 153 scholars at the Sunday school. Sunday congregations remain large and regular. The church had 60 members and there were a further 70 members in the 5 other places in the circuit. About £90 was needed as a special effort to renovate the parsonage, for furniture and removal expenses and for a new fence at the circuit paddock where stray cattle were stealing grass.

Stock Route Cases.

A letter to the editor complains that W.H. McKinlay was fined £2 plus costs to a total of £7-8-0, for failure to give notice of intent to travel across a property despite having given such notice by mail – the judge agreeing that mail was insufficient, though the Stock Diseases Act in Clause 20 clearly defines how and when such notices shall be given, but does not specify as to delivery or posting – merely that proof of delivery is sufficient. Secondly Mr Collins of Mt Bryan proceeded against Mr Harris for crossing his land without notice. The SM ruled that notice was required for the main road and not the one used by Mr Harris and dismissed the case with costs to the plaintiff. This makes a confusion of Clause 20.

Railway Accident, c. 3 miles north of Burra at a spot known as Forder’s on Thursday evening.

The driver and stoker of the goods train noticed they had run over something. They stopped and searched, but failed to find anything. They reported the matter at Mt Bryan and a ganger was sent out to investigate. He found the sickening remains of a man who appears to have lain down on the rails to await his doom. His head and upper torso was found about 12 yards from where the train struck him and his legs about 50 yards further on; ‘between this were found a number of pieces of flesh, etc., which had to be picked up in a bucket, filling it to the brim.’ Nothing further was found to identify the victim. A further search on Friday found a pocket knife and a couple of pieces of ivory. He was c. 5’11” tall. At the inquest on Saturday Lawrence O’Brien, hotelkeeper of Redruth, said he saw the deceased on Thursday 13 June in the hotel for dinner and he had given the name of Fitzgerald and had no relatives in SA. He came from Waterford in Ireland when he was 14 and went to California. In Australia he had worked at Oodnadatta with a boring contractor. He did not mention his first name and said he was headed for Adelaide. He had paid for his dinner and two nobblers of brandy.

Thomas Vivian saw the deceased on Thursday about 3.30 p.m. near Cobb & Co.’s Corner when he appeared to be quite sober, but had no swag. He was killed no more than 50 yards from where Vivian saw him leaning on E.N. Finch’s fence.

E.N. Finch confirmed seeing him about dusk.

M-C Phelan then described the appearance of the body parts as he had seen them on Thursday night.

Verdict: ‘Death by throwing himself in front of the engine whilst in an unsound state of mind.’

Editorial on the pending negotiations for the sale of the Burra Mine.

There seems to be some prospects for the reopening of the mine which would be good news for the town. It is to be deplored that such a valuable mine has been allowed to be idle for so long: two recent bores having proved a mass of wealth under the ground. Large dumps all over the property contain valuable ore and the old slagheap tells of other carelessness. We trust the present syndicate will purchase the property and succeed in reopening the mine.

Burra Defence Rifle Club. About 40 members will visit Adelaide on 9 & 10 July to take part in the reception for their Royal Highnesses the Duke & Duchess of York. Members will receive 5/- to cover the day’s expenses and applications for passes must be sent to the local president at once.

Extract from the Register concerning the reopening of Burra Mine.

SA would be all the richer if the Burra Burra Copper Mine, 100 miles north of Adelaide, were reopened. A strong effort is currently being made to reopen the mine. A proposal will soon be placed before the public to form a company with a nominated capital of £250,000 to purchase and work the same.

Discovered in 1845, the wealth was exploited by the SA Mining Association. In 291⁄2 years it yielded about £4,750,000 worth of copper ore. £2,241,167 was spent in wages and over £800,000 went to the fortunate shareholders. Most ore came from a rich pocket of carbonate ore between the surface and 300 feet. The other big workings, 1,000’ away, were where a shaft was sunk 600’ and two large reefs were struck. Mr W. West, who manages the property, believes ‘she will make a very deep mine’. Little was done to develop the mine at depth when it was producing well and when supplies of the oxidised ore began to fail there was insufficient money to carry on the necessary deadwork. There had been one or two suspensions previously, but the mine finally closed in 1877.

Copper prices have now risen again, machinery is now better and more economical and the cost of carriage and fuel is now much lower. A ton of copper could now be landed at Pt Adelaide from the mine for 7/4 as against 25/8 in the old days. A ton of coal delivered to the mine now for 30/- was then worth £2-10-0.

Tributers fossicking about the place have found rich ore and the waste stuff and tailings are all worth reworking by modern methods. The shares of the SAMA are now mainly in the hands of executors and trustees who cannot speculate, but it is proposed the new company buy the whole mine – a freehold of 672 acres and mining rights over 11,065 acres.

Recent bores have found copper pyrites at 813’ and continued for many feet, confirming the downwards continuation of copper bearing ground. For the past 14 years tributers varying from 5 to 30 have been making a living and 15 are presently employed. In full production the mine should employ about 1,000 men. [This effort was to result in the formation of the Burra Burra Copper Co.]

Letter to the Editor speaking against the sins of having an opera society in the town.

‘It is with pain that I have just learned that there is in Burra such a thing as an opera society.’

Salvation Army. A farewell social was given at the Barracks on 25 June for Sister Edith Phillips who is leaving for the Salvation Army Training Home in Melbourne. She has been in the local corps for over 10 years. Captain Munro, on behalf of the soldiers and friends, presented her with a Bible.

[Johnny Green.] The Burra Mine possesses a splendid echo and on top of the engine house is a battered and weather-beaten effigy. No one knows how it came there or who it represents. It is supposed to be an image of the shepherd who found the ore. When asked what he wanted as a reward, he asked for a pound a week and a bullock team. One payday he bought a small keg of rum. Next morning his charred remains were found beneath the burnt remains of the keg and dray.

Obituary. Mrs Elizabeth Gillett, of Gum Creek, has died. Though ailing for some time, she only took to her bed about ten days before dying and the end was unexpected. She was born 31 March 1832 and arrived in SA in the Oriana and married Mr H.J. Thompson of Gawler, who died when thrown from his horse eight months after the wedding. They had one son, Mr Harry Thompson, who died when he fell down a well at Craddock in 1898.

Her second marriage was to G.B. Gillett of Salisbury at Trinity Church, Adelaide 28 May 1851. She lived variously at Salisbury, Clare, Hill river and Gum Creek and finally at ‘Manilla’, six miles from Kooringa, for the last 22 years. There were 15 children by the second marriage, of who four sons and four daughters survive: Mrs T. Turner (Hampton), Mrs E. Harris (Kooringa), & the Misses J. & F. Gillett who live at home.

Theft at Rev. Murphy’s. Following the recent theft from Rev. W.G.M. Murphy of food and clothing suspicion fell on a young girl recently employed there, but she could not be found to be questioned. On returning to his home on Wednesday evening he found a bundle near the door comprising his mackintosh and other articles that had been taken. When he called his wife she heard a noise in one room and Rev. Murphy saw Olive Fox exit through the study window. She was caught near the fence. She had been hiding for some days in the Methodist Church yard at Redruth, behind a thick clump of trees, despite heavy frosts. She was not found even by the black tracker brought in. The girl had wrapped her feet in her flannel undergarment to avoid making a noise and to conceal her tracks. She was returned to the Reformatory where she had been before working for Mr Murphy. She had been sent there for being a neglected child living with Aboriginals in the SE. The police had spent five days scouring the country for Olive Fox. She might have eluded capture had she hidden her luggage instead of leaving it outside Mr Murphy’s house on her second visit.

Obituary. Mr Carl Oppermann of Llwchyr died on Thursday [4 July] aged 74.

He arrived in Burra in 1854 by the ship Johann Caesar. He was born at Claustal in the Hartz Mountains, Hanover on 21 June 1827. He worked for some time at the Burra Mine and also for the Main Roads Board and most recently with the Burra District Council. He was much respected for his straightforwardness and integrity. He was a keen floriculturalist, winning many prizes at the local flower shows. He also grew many kinds of fruit.

He was known to all as Charlie Oppermann.

Married in St Mary’s on 21 May 1855 by Rev. J.H. Ibbetson and had ten children.

Survived by 3 daughters and 4 sons:

Mrs G. Dow (Burra), Mrs Topperwein (Parkside). Of the sons only Mr W. Oppermann is married and lives in Burra. Mr M. Oppermann of Wolloway is a brother of the deceased. He joined the Burra Burra Lodge 43 years ago.

Les Cloches de Cornville was presented by the Opera Society at the Burra Institute. The Burra Orchestra played and the proceeds, which were satisfactory, went to the Burra Jubilee Benevolent Society.

The Duke & Duchess of York arrived in Adelaide. Every street was thronged and the illuminations at night were marvellous and a spectacle of grandeur that will long live in the memory of those who saw it.

A Bolt. A pair of horses with a buggy bolted from the stables on Sunday morning. They left the trap hanging on a corner guard in Kingston St, wheels broken and body bent. The horses went along Commercial St and turned onto the hill near Mr Thomas Sandland’s, thence across to Queen St, down Stock St, into Lower Thames St and thence via Kingston St and were about to turn into the road to Victoria Park when they lost the buggy.

Burra Defence Rifle Club. The contingent that went to the celebrations or the Royal Visit in Adelaide returned on Wednesday & Thursday evenings and said the capital was a veritable fairyland with the illuminations for the visit.

Salvation Army. Last Sunday was a great day at the Barracks when it was announced that Captain Munro would be farewelled. He had arrived as a lieutenant, but was promoted after a couple of months. He has worked alone since February and has been a very energetic and popular leader. He goes to Strathalbyn and will be succeeded by the lady officers, Captain Keeble and Lieut. Lacy.

Burra Waterworks. The prospect of some activity at the mine suggests the town should be considering what needs to be done to secure a sure water supply. The Mt Horrocks proposal is far too costly. The present supply is of poor quality and a reopening of the mine would see it go dry.

The firm’s business extends as far as the NT.

Burra Coursing Club. The annual meet took place at Gum Creek Station on Wednesday last ob land lent by Hon. J.J. Duncan MLC. It all went very successfully. Hares were numerous and some excellent runs ensued. Beginning at 9 a.m. three runs were recorded in 3⁄4 hour. Most successful were Messrs A. Millard, Vivian and Gurry.

Snow in Burra.

Last Sunday [28 July] ‘we witnessed the heavist [sic] fall of snow seen in South Australia.’

On Saturday afternoon light flakes fell and more in larger form towards evening, but they melted before they could be examined and about 10 p.m. the fall grew heavier and the ground covered. Despite the late hour snowballs were soon made and snowballing indulged in for a couple of hours. On Sunday morning the whole landscape was clad in whiteness some two or three inches thick: ‘scores essayed the task of climbing to the hill tops, and their presence could be seen from a much greater distance than on ordinary occasions.’

‘Every man, woman and child could be seen either snowballing or participating in the fun provided by others.’

At one time fully fifty persons were engaged in Market Square. In Redruth near the reserve Messrs Lowe, Goodwin and company produced a ball about 10’ in diameter and some 15’ high. Alongside some buildings drifts 3’ deep accumulated. Snow continued to fall at intervals – the largest flakes about midday, but from then on the ‘great and glorious sight’ commenced to fade away. Some snowballs remained till rain on Monday afternoon. The fall was widespread and the creek was flowing strongly on Saturday night. The shade temperature on Sunday was 34-40°F.

[There is another 1⁄2 column review of the snowfall by the Rev. W.F. James, but it adds little to the preceding.]

Bishop Harmer will visit Burra for a confirmation service on Tuesday 6 August.

Boer War. There was a welcome home social for Trooper Clem Treloar, to which Trooper Martin was also invited. E.W.

Burra Band Picnic today at Princess Royal.

A Bolt. A clap of thunder caused a horse of A.W. Clode to take fright last Thursday at the Reservoir Quarry. It rushed down the hill and along a couple of streets with the chains dangling about its feet. These eventually tangled it up just at the Black Bridge in Aberdeen and the horse fell and slid along the ground for 17 yards. Amazingly it was not even scratched, though the collar was a little damaged. The horse lay prostrate on the ground till released.

Public Meeting. A meeting of taxpayers called as requested by the Mayor, E.W. Crewes, had a reduced attendance at the Institute on Friday, due to the rain: a thunderstorm producing torrents at 7 p.m. Similar meetings at other towns were forwarding requests to Parliament for a reduction in the cost of Government. Crewes strongly supported this move. As much work previously done by the State Parliament was now a federal responsibility this seemed an obvious opportunity to cut costs, but the present Government was doing nothing in this direction.

W.G. Hawkes moved and T. Best 2nd:

‘This meeting of the taxpayers of Burra and district views with alarm the serious cost of maintaining both Houses of the State Parliament at their present strength notwithstanding the reductions promised on the eve of Federation, and while not desiring to lay down the lines on which reductions should be made insists on a substantial reduction in the numerical strength of both Houses during the present session.’

Mr Radford urged a stronger resolution.

Mr Hardy moved an amendment to the effect that representation be reduced by one half in both Houses and the Ministry to four members at a salary of £800 p.a., but this failed to be 2nd. The motion was carried unanimously.

J.E.H. Winnall moved that the Mayor communicate the resolution just passed to all members representing the district and urging the necessity of dealing with these reductions in the present session. Carried.

J. McLaren moved that members be careful that any such reduction not give country districts a less proportion than at present. Carried.

Football. Burra travelled to Terowie on Wednesday, but as some members had to be back the same day it was quite a rushed trip. They took the midday train north and the 3.30 p.m. luggage train south from Terowie which left little enough time for the match which started at 1.30 p.m.

Reminiscences of Burra

3 April 1846 Mr Penny, a director, arrived with his brother, C.M. Penny and at 10 a.m. inspected the workings and visited the town of Kooringa.

4 April The Messrs Penny went 3 miles beyond the company boundary and claimed to have seen indications of silver ore. Dr Thompson, the newly appointed mine director, arrived at 7 a.m. with Mr Mellor and took quarters initially with Mr Boswarva, mine storekeeper. Directors Messrs Bunce and Kingston arrived.

5 April. The Messrs Penny left at 6 a.m. Messrs Bunce, Crawford and the Resident Director, S. Stocks, inspected the workings before breakfast and then the township and the land selected for a hotel. Mr Crawford is to be the first landlord and wanted a guarantee that there would be only one hotel in Kooringa. The following tenants took possession of the four company cottages: [Thames St?]

Jenkins, Francis, Carter and Phillip Mason lived in the cookhouse.

Obituary. Former Bible Christian pioneer James Blachford, an old resident of the huts in the Burra Creek, has died and a memorial service was conducted by Rev. W.F. James at Redruth Methodist Church last Sunday. [Registered as Blatchford]

James Blachford was born at Stoke Climsland, Cornwall 2 December 1808 and began work at the age of 7 for 18d a month. His mother died when he was 13, leaving a brother aged 9 and a sister aged 11. The father left the children to care for themselves. James eventually went to live at a public house and dancing and wrestling were his favourite pastimes. At 24 he married Eliza Skinner. He never went to school, but learned to read and write. At 26 he converted to the Bible Christian Church at Tinhay in Devon. A few years later he was widowed with two small boys and subsequently married Charity Jury who survives him. He began to preach and soon a chapel to seat 200 was built. Early in 1847 he spoke to James Torr, an uncle of Dr Torr of Way College and they decided to go to SA which was much talked of in England on account of the Burra Mine. Torr went first and Blachford followed in May 1847. He preached on the ship with revivalist fervour. The ship arrived in September 1847. His family shared a building with the Torr family for three months before starting out for Burra in a bullock dray: a journey that took six days. They lived in a large room at the mine shared by many families for many weeks before Blachford dug a hut in the bank on the north side of Welsh Creek near the Smelting Works. There were then some 4,000 in Burra and two churches: a Wesleyan and an Anglican. The Primitive Methodists held services, but lacked a parson and a church. Blachford met John Stephens whom he had known in England and they decided to hold prayer meetings at Stephen’s home near Redruth where it seems there were then no services. Before this could happen Thomas & John Pellew, John Halse, and many other Bible Christians arrived from England. Thomas Pellew was appointed Class Leader and 15 persons attended the first Sunday morning. James Blachford preached his first sermon in the open air about 52 years ago. John Halse, John Pellew and Blachford preached in turn. After vainly trying to get land at Redruth and Aberdeen, a site near the present Kingston St Bridge was obtained from the mine Directors at a peppercorn rent. After difficulties a church to seat 200 was built. Mrs Blachford sewed the calico ceiling. All bills were paid as due. A Sunday school was established and a choir formed. There were many conversions and 47 members. All this was accomplished before the first two Bible Christian ministers arrived in December 1850. They found a large congregation, a church worth £400 with a debt of only £30 that did not bear interest. Rev. James Row settled in Burra and succeeded well till the Victorian gold rush which took almost all the men to the diggings. James Blachford went twice, where he did well briefly and preached too. On returning to Burra he was a butcher near the Primitive Methodist Church in Kooringa before moving to Upper Wakefield. Here he slowly built a congregation and a church was built and a Sunday school conducted by him for over ten years. From Wakefield he moved to Watervale and kept a store where he gave good service to the church and contributions to the circuit rose from £20 to £80 p.a. 23 years ago he went to Adelaide and stayed there the rest of his life. In his 86th year he would preach three times a Sunday, walking to his appointments. He continued to attend Class Meetings in Gilbert St after his 92nd birthday. His son Henry was his sole support and he died tragically in January. James Blachford died on 10 September in his 93rd year.

Mining:

A Burra syndicate is being formed to send men to Arltunga (near Alice Springs).

Another is to prospect a claim near Hallett’s known as “Kelly’s”.

Mr Joseph Ford continues to work on the old mine property.

Burra Mine.

An attempt is being made to float a company to buy this property. The mine closed in 1877 due to the low price of copper, but now operations would be cheaper, fuel is cheaper and so is cartage, so it is believed the mine would be profitable. On closure in 1877 the company had just proved the existence of rich sulphide ore some 300’ below the deepest point at which oxidised ore was found, but there was no capital for the dead work. It is estimated a working capital of at least £60,000 would be needed. The tailings and ore material are estimated at from 170,000 to 440,000 tons and assay at 0.86 to 2.72% copper. Mr Greenway, manager of Broken Hill Propriety Block 14 Co. says some of these may yield a profit of 2/- to 3/- a ton and other 4/- to 5/- per ton. Capital of the new company will comprise £120,000 in £1 shares. T.B. Gall has a sample of carbonate ore said to come from tributers to the east of the old open cut at 60’ and estimated to assay at 40-50% copper. Sulphides have been got from Morphett’s Shaft and carbonate ore at 3% is exposed around the open cut and this can be treated the same way as the tailings. (From an article in The Advertiser.) [This new company was to become the Burra Burra Copper Co.]

Burra Mine.

A prospectus has now been issued for the new company [to be known as the Burra Burra Copper Co.] The nominal capital will be £120,000 in £1 shares. 50,000 will be offered to the public, 5/- on application, 5/- on allotment, and the balance when required in calls not exceeding 6d per month, though it is thought calls will not be needed on account of the profits to be made from the waste heaps and ore on or near the surface. The company to be registered under the no-liability clause of the Companies Act 1892. All capital to be paid will be available for prospecting and development except for about £7,000 to purchase the site.

The Redruth Reformatory.

Agnes Dyke (16) and Maud Daniels (17), who escaped about a fortnight ago, have eluded the police search in a unique manner. Before leaving they provided themselves with food and clothing and took a shawl of Mrs Holden’s valued at £4-£5. They made this into two boys’ caps to deceive observers. They also cut their hair and donned breeches. The breeches were made from costumes used in concerts and they managed to pass as boys for at least 10 days. They arrived near Morgan after three days, staying at Mrs Shell’s one night as boys looking for work. Mistaking the road, they found themselves the next day at Florieton and then went on to Mr Kickebusche’s in the Hd King. He deduced they were girls and advised them to surrender rather than be taken by the police who were on their track. M-C Phelan was not far away, but admits he would have passed them as boys. They travelled at night mostly and if seen in the day pretended to be boys out rabbiting. They are now again located at Redruth Reformatory.

Rev. W.F. James preached and at the tea meeting on Monday lectured on President Garfield and gave a sketch of the Church’s history.

Nearly 13 years ago spare land near Booborowie Station was thrown open as workingmen’s blocks and many settled in the district. Methodist services were commenced in Mr Wall’s Dining Room and held there for about 21⁄2 years. Attendance was good and income about £1-10-2 per quarter. A Blockers’ Picnic on Christmas Day 1890 raised £8-9-0 to start a building fund for the church that might also serve as a day school. Two allotments were bought for £10-10-0. A meeting on 1 September 1891 at Mr Tohl’s house decided to erect a stone building 25’ x 15’ and in time voluntary labour placed all material on the site. Mr Giles was treasurer, later succeeded by Mr Reynolds. C. & A. Fuss began work in mid September 1891 and finished within two months. The cost including land was £194. Subscriptions were £23, picnic raised £8, and donated labour was worth £53. £100 was borrowed at 7% and £10 was raised at the opening.

The Sunday school began with 23 scholars in February 1892. Trees were planted through the kindness of James Loudon. The church is being used by the Education Department as a day school with almost 50 scholars. Within four years £50 of debt was paid off and in the fifth year the remainder was paid due to the generosity of Messrs Brown, owners of Booborowie Station. Membership began with 2 and gradually rose to 5. The church has also been used for some months by an unsectarian Literary Society and many Band of Hope meetings have been held.

Obituary and inquest. Mrs R. Field reported on Friday that her servant Mary Quinn had given birth to a child at her residence ‘Monavea’, four miles from Burra. The girl had collapsed in a critical state, having concealed both the pregnancy and the birth. The child died and was hidden in a box on the Wednesday night. Mary is now in the Burra Hospital and the inquest which opened on Saturday was adjourned to 16 November to allow the girl time to recover.

[The unnamed female child was registered as being born and dying on 30 October 1901 aged 1 hour]

Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting: Friday at the Institute. It was a very tame affair and only 4 or 5 people were present at 7.30 and by 8.10 a mere 8. A few more appeared later. Not one candidate came forward for the vacancies that are about to occur.

Those to retire are Crs J. McLaren, C.C Williams & W.H. Hardy.

In 1901 the Council continued to asphalt footpaths and it is to be hoped this will continue. A heavy flood early in the year damaged roads and bridges, especially in the north end of town.

For better lighting a lamp has been placed on the Commercial St Bridge in West Ward and on the Black Bridge in Redruth. Both were much needed.

We began the year with a debit of £21-18-8 and at the last meeting there was a credit of £85-12-4.

£219-6-9 has been spent on public works. The general rate is up from 8d to 9d, but the health rate is down from 4d to 3d. The park lands rate will remain at 1d and the assessment for 1902 is £117-5-0 more than for last year.

A detailed financial statement follows.

Many trees have been damaged or destroyed by a person or persons unknown. Pepper trees have been planted from St Mary’s to the Mine Bridge.

At Victoria Park a new cricket pitch has been laid and the bicycle track is about to receive attention.

The cemetery is in good order and its account in credit £42-14-1.

A £100 special grant was received to effect repairs to the Commercial St Bridge.

Waterworks.

Two years ago they were in a bad way – reliant on one boiler which was in a bad state and the engine was struggling to keep going. Today the boiler and engine are in thorough order and can be relied on. The Cornish engine has been repaired. The smaller boiler has been re-tubed and refitted and the engine thoroughly overhauled and several worn parts replaced. The worn out iron chimney has been replaced by a new stone one and a cement floor laid in the boiler house. Close to £200 has been expended and after paying working expenses we have £176-18-3 in hand. The day is not far off when we will have to provide a larger reservoir as out population will be on the increase. [This estimate was at least in part based on the reopening of the mine.] The present reservoir holds only 33,000 gallons. I would suggest one of 200,000 gallons. A quarry near the old one could be utilized and the whole done for about £300. This could store several days’ supply. William Pryor, in charge of the works, has proved a painstaking and capable officer.

The slaughterhouse.

Despite several attempts to get over this question the Council has not been able to achieve a result, but at least now all meat sold in Burra is inspected. A site for a new rubbish depot has been selected.

The Mayor thanked the Town Clerk, Mr O. Bartholomaeus for his careful attention.

Mr J. Jenkins appeared to object to the planting of trees on the road to the Mine Bridge as it was ‘beautifying private property’, but the Mayor thought it a credit to Council.

Mr Jenkins was also annoyed that the Council had acted against public opinion in the slaughterhouse issue, but the Mayor said it had been impossible to proceed on the lines resolved upon. The Burra Council was not the only one not to have a public slaughterhouse – even Adelaide did not have one. Cr McLaren said that the authorities seem to have realised that the Health Act as presently constituted was unworkable. He regretted the apparent apathy of businessmen with regards to municipal matters.

Cr hardy supported the Mayor’s speech. The £4 the North Ward was overdrawn was due to the flood early in the year. He said the slaughterhouse question would have been settled if SAMA had not asked an exorbitant price – Mr Jenkins said: ‘They wanted £220.’

Cr Hardy: ‘They asked £500 for it.’

Burra Town Council, 18 November.

The matter of poison baits laid around the town has been referred to the police.

Gravel to be laid on the Victoria Park bicycle track.

Annual Hallett Sports, held on 11 November, are reported. They were a success and were followed by a successful evening concert. Results are printed.

Rev. E.J. Piper is about to visit Burra. He is the son of the Rev. T. Piper, President of the United Methodist Conference of SA. He has spent about seven years in missionary work in China. He will preach at Redruth on Sunday morning and at Kooringa in the evening.

Crops around Burra are good, though there will be little return in the eastern country.

Boer War. T.P. Halls has received a letter from his brother Sappho telling of some interesting incidents in the war in South Africa. Though in the thickest of some of the fights, Sappho has so far escaped injury. He thinks it will be some time yet before the conflict ends.

Mr Alex Harris is reported to be ill and compelled to keep to his bed, but he is said to be making favourable progress.

Obituary and inquest.

On 2 November at the Burra Hospital an inquest was held into the death of the baby found in a box at ‘Monovea’, the residence of Mr R. Field. E.W. Crewes as coroner and C. Fuss as foreman of the jury.

Amelia Mary Theresa Field said she had hired Mary Quinn from Mrs Phillips’s office as a general servant about 3 August and she had begun on 7 August. She did not know she was pregnant. When she had spoken about her peculiar figure the girl had said she had undergone two operations at the Adelaide Hospital. She could easily have summoned assistance in the night if she required it. The box marked A was the property of Mary Quinn. On 30 October in the afternoon Mary complained of feeling ill. She retired as usual about 8 p.m. When Mrs Field saw her in her room at 7.30 a.m. on the 31st she said she felt better and would get up. She went on with her duties, but about 4.30 went to her room and a little later her door was found to be locked. She retired at 7 o’clock Thursday evening and got up at 6 a.m. on 1 November and brought tea to Mrs Field. She then washed some blankets. Later Mrs Field noticed Mary’s bed was in a bad state and on going into the bedroom opened the box and found a newborn child. She then sent for the doctor and the police while Mary continued to do household duties.

Mrs Field, who was 75, said she was much upset.

When Dr Sangster arrived he was given all the information and he ordered Mary’s removal to the Burra Hospital. She left in the company of the police who also took the body of the child.

Dr Sangster confirmed the above and said he thought the birth occurred on Wednesday night 30 October. Mary was slightly feverish for about a week, but showed no signs of mental aberration.

Mary told Dr Sangster she had not expected her confinement for two months and had hoped to go to her mother’s before then. She said the child was born in the dark and fell to the floor and when she tried to light the candle to pick it up the pillow fell on it. That is all she had to say.

The jury decided that the baby’s death was due to neglect on the part of its mother.

M-C Jemison told the prisoner the charge and the coroner committed her to trial at the Supreme Court in Adelaide.

Burra Defence Rifle Club. Firing match for the marble clock, 16 & 20 November:

A. Bevan 99 from E.A. Pearce 89.

Redruth Sunday School Anniversary, 12 November. Services conducted by Rev. W.F. James. In the afternoon he gave the connective readings for the pathetic and instructive series of songs entitled Dick’s Charge, compiled by Mr R. Cook of Aberdeen. The afternoon and evening services saw nearly 400 crowded into the building. The Monday picnic was at Koonoona where games were enjoyed. Tea and supper on Tuesday were not largely patronised, though the public meeting was well attended. There were 177 scholars with an average attendance in the morning of37 and afternoon of 96. There were 24 teachers. There was a largely attended teachers' social on Thursday to round off the anniversary.

S. Barker writes to the editor complaining of the lack of action to his protest that some of the fruit shown at the Burra show was of a type or class not grown anywhere in the district, so flouting the rules of the show.

Burra Racing Club held a meeting at the Commercial Hotel at 8 p.m. on Thursday.

Burra Literary Soc. met last Thursday and discussed the trial scene from The Merchant of Venice. Rev. Clarke gave a character sketch of Shylock. (The bond scene preceded the trial scene.)

Broken Hill. About 2,400 men have been thrown out of work in the last 12 months. In 1900 7,260 were employed and at present 4,860.

Red Rust has appeared in wheat crops in the last two weeks and many crops will have to be cut for hay. The yield is now estimated at about 7 bushels, but we doubt if it will reach this.

The Telephone. An effort is being made to induce the Government to arrange telephonic communication between Kooringa, Redruth and Aberdeen and to the Burra Railway Station. It is to be hoped this effort will succeed. Almost every businessman in town has signed the memorial to be forwarded to the Government.

Salvation Army. Ensign Melksham, who some time ago conducted the Salvation Army operations in Burra, visited the town last week and preached in the Barracks on Sunday evening. He is presently stationed at Unley.

Burra Town Council served refreshments after the meeting on Friday evening as it was the last meeting over which the retiring Mayor would preside.

Burra Burra Mine. Those who have taken shares in the Burra Burra Copper Co. are reminded that if they surrender their allotment notice they will receive in return the necessary scrip. A meeting of shareholders will be held as soon as possible.

The Mayor A. Harris is now convalescent, but it will be two or three weeks before he can attend to Mayoral duties.

Burra Literary Soc. will hold its annual social tomorrow evening.

Grasshoppers are making their presence felt in town, but not as badly as last year.

Rev. W.F. James writes concerning the recent election for North Ward. On 26 November he received a letter form W.H. Hardy soliciting his support in the election, to which he made no reply.

[The text of Hardy’s letter is printed.]

On 3 December he received a second letter from Hardy:

‘I beg to congratulate you on your untiring efforts in re recent municipal elections for North Ward, and thank you accordingly, your success I am sure being worthy of your task.

I am, sir, etc. W.H. Hardy.’

This was such a sarcastic tone that Rev. James demanded an apology, failing which he would publish both of Hardy’s letters.

There was a defiant response dated 5 December 1901 instead of an apology and so Rev. James sends Hardy’s letters for publication. He explains that in fact he asked no one to support either candidate in the election.

Ernest Crewes writes to the editor, drawing attention to the plight of Mr Ah Chin, who lost all his household effects, two tons of chaff, harness etc. through a fire on Monday. He is utterly destitute with a wife and family to maintain. As an ‘honest straightforward and hard-working man’ he is ‘worthy of all the help and support we can give him at this juncture.’

The editor indicates his willingness to receive and acknowledge all contributions sent in.

Cricket. At Victoria Park on Saturday the South End of Town 197 defeated North End of Town 144.

Burra School observed visiting day on Friday. The children displayed their skills in singing, mental arithmetic, geography, callisthenics and other subjects. Papers and other works were spread out for inspection. 357 children are on the roll, up 7 on 1900. In Class IV 18 Compulsory Certificates were gained and in Class V 19 Honour Certificates.

Obituary. William Albert Murray, noted sheep breeder of Cappeedee, aged 37 was taken ill on 27 November and removed to the Burra Hospital. Peritonitis following an internal blockage resulted in his death on 3 December. He was the youngest son of Mr John Murray of Mt Crawford and was devoted to maintaining the reputation of the famous Murray Merinos. He was renowned as an emblem of honour, his name synonymous with straightness. He is well remembered here from playing polo on the local ground with the brothers Bowman.

[The birth is registered as William Albert Murray 31 July 1862 and the death as William Arthur Murray 3 December 1901 aged 39]

Burra Town Council, 4 December.

Cr West took the chair in the absence of the Mayor, A. Harris, who was granted a month’s leave of absence on account of bad health.

The sports committee thanks the Council for the gift of 10 loads of gravel.

The new Councillors took their seats and were welcomed by Councillor West. The 1902 meetings will be held on 1st and 3rd Mondays in the month at 7.30 p.m.

Cr Ford gave notice on a motion for the next meeting, that the Mayor be given an allowance of £20 for the year.

Fire. Kingston St was alarmed on Monday afternoon when it became known the premises of Mr Ah Chin were ablaze. It was a hot day and the roof, mainly of palings, burnt rapidly. Only a washstand was saved so rapid and fierce was the fire. Ah Chin was digging a well when his adopted son, aged three or four, found some matches. Mrs Chin had a day’s engagement at the hospital. The young boy began in the chaff-house. Ah Chin found the boy and a companion in the smoke-filled room and saved them. All household furniture was lost. Nothing was insured. An adjoining house to the east narrowly escaped. The house itself of eight rooms and owned by SAMA was insured for £50. Ah Chin is much respected as a fruit hawker. His losses amount to about £75.

Kooringa Methodist Church Fete was held last Friday in the Institute. It was a great success and was opened by Dr Sangster Jun. The object was to raise the balance of the sum of £130 promised towards the connexional fund concerned with the Twentieth Century Movement. Last year £700 was raised, but in the interest of local trust funds. The church has now raised £830 towards this fund. The takings on Friday amounted to £79-10-0.

Burra Literary Soc. held their annual social at the Kooringa Methodist Hall. It was an evening of toasts, music, elocution and a dramatic scene. Refreshments began at 8 p.m. After the National Anthem and Loyal Toast there was a performance of the trial scene from The Merchant of Venice. There were 52 members of the society and they were soon to lose two good members in Rev. W.G. Clarke & Mrs Clarke who are likely to move before the next session. Mr Clarke has been President since the society started three years ago.

Court Pride, Lodge celebrated their annual picnic at Mr W. Barker’s estate at Baldina on Wednesday. Dinner was followed by sports. The very hot day induced many to drink too much water and about 21 came home unwell as a result of too much water combined with bananas, cherries, lollies and the like.

Burra Town Council.

The lowest tenders for streetlights were from W.G. Neville in North Ward and W. Geake for Kooringa.

The Mayor Mr A. Harris is not as well this week, owing to the severity of the complaint and the disagreeable weather.

Editorial on general Christmas sentiments.

The editor looks to the opening of the Burra Mine with hope, as it has been ‘purchased by an enterprising syndicate’.

In farming the season has been a failure for the 7th successive year due to rust and unfavourable weather.

Wool prices are only half what they were 12 months ago, but the overall two-year average is still good.

Mr Frank & Mrs Margaret Fisk, former residents of Burra, returned last week and set up in Paxton Square. They drank and were merry and attracted a group of children. Police broke up the gathering, but later they were again disturbed by police in Thames St and run in for the night and later fined 10/- each.

Redruth Court, 21 December

James Knevitt, William Knevitt & Frank Hornhardt were each fined £1 + 10/- costs (or 7 days) for indecent language.

They were also charged with disturbing the peace on the licensed premises of F.J. Uren. James Knevitt was fined 10/- and the other two 15/- each. Costs amounted to £4-9-0.

Supreme Court, Adelaide, 19 December 1901

Griffith Harry sought probate for the will of Mary Edwina Harry, who died 9 December 1901. Jane Frederica Motley claimed the will was not duly executed and at the time the deceased was not of sound mind, memory or understanding and did not know of and approve the contents of the will.

The ruling was that the testatrix was not of a sound mind, memory and understanding and the will was declared invalid and void. The plaintiff was not awarded costs. The defendants’ costs to be drawn from the estate.

Characteristics of the paper in 1901.

Page 1 was as usual full of larger advertisements, but most were now not local.

Pages 2 and 3 carried smaller business advertisements. There were no editorials, and the local news tended to come in small items which were annoyingly interspersed with long small print articles that look at first like news, but turn out to be advertisements for such things as: Dr Morse’s Indian Root Pills, Dr Williams’ Pink Pills (for Pale People), Bile Beans, Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral, Ayer’s cherry Pectoral Plasters and Clement’s Tonic.

Page 4 continues with advertisements dominated by patent medicines including: Vitadatio (a cure for hydatids), Holloway’s Pills & Beecham’s Pills.

There is a serial: The Quality of Mercy, by U.X.L. (Author of Carl‘s Old Rug, Cabbage Tree Man, etc.) on page 3. There is some padding with jokes etc, but it is minimal most weeks. These became more noticeable by May when the serials ceased, but their quantity was erratic. Towards the end of the year a serial returned with Marie by U.X.L. Which ran from 13 November to 18 December (missing out 20 November).

‘Sparks’ are less cryptic than when they first appeared with one word comments.

The news has to be sought amid the advertisements which appear in similar style and print, though some of the latter are distinguished with illustrations.

Numbering of issues in 1901

Volume XV continued for the whole year, having started 7 December 1892.

The year began with Volume XV Number 448 on 2 January 1901

And continued to Volume XV Number 495 on 25 December 1901

Numbering was fairly consistent, but there were a few anomalies.

472 was used twice and 473 was not used.

478 was used twice.

486 was used a second time in error for 489 which lead to a second use also of 487 & 488 before 489 restored the correct sequence.

The Holidays. Christmas Day was quiet, but there were sports at Victoria Park on Boxing Day. The weather was favourable for sports and the many picnic parties organised.

On Boxing Day members of the lodges assembled at the Institute and marched to Victoria Park led by the Burra Band. This was hardly a success due to the small number of members who marched. The sports themselves were successful, though gate takings were down on last year. The track, though improved, needs asphalting. Until this is done money will be wasted annually as even after spending on it, rain and other factors destroy the surface. This year saw £10 outlaid for only a partial success. Entries in the Sheffield, hurdles and 440 yards did not meet the prizes given and so they were cancelled. Bicycle events remained the most popular. Takings at the concert were up on last year by several pounds and the Gawler Dramatic Co.’s sensational drama A wife’s Peril was staged very creditably.

M-C Jemison said he was at Boolcoomatta Station and a warrant for his arrest would cost him his job to the disadvantage of his wife and family. He asked for the case to be heard ex parte and the bench agreed. The fine was £1-12-0 with court fees of 15/- and witness fee of 7/- for a total of £1-12-0. [This doesn’t make sense so either the total was £2-14-0 or the original fine was 10/- and the total as stated. A month was allowed to pay or 1 month in jail.]

Obituary. Alex. Harris died on 25 December 1901, aged 62. He was born in the parish of Kenwyn near Truro in Wales in June 1840. In March 1849 he left England for SA, arriving in Adelaide on 1 June 1849. The family then proceeded to Burra. He worked in the Burra Mine for several years, but when the Wallaroo Mines opened he went to Kadina and opened a store as a produce merchant. Later he returned to Burra and traded as a storekeeper and a wood and chaff merchant. He was Chairman of the Burra School Board of Advice, a Councillor for the Burra Corporation and one of the town’s JPs. He was an energetic worker for the church, being a superintendent of the Kooringa Methodist Sunday School. He was elected Mayor, unopposed on 1 December 1901, but was taken ill before being sworn in and did not preside at any meetings. He was a member of Kooringa Lodge of Freemasons and had just completed a term as W.M. For about 30 years he had been a member of the Kadina Lodge MUIOOF. The funeral on Thursday was very largely attended. He leaves a wife, one son and one daughter.

J. Ford, who is working the Burra Mine, met with an accident last Saturday. While paying his men on the Burra Mine property he slipped down a shaft some 15’ and was badly shaken, though no more serious effects are expected.

Marriage. On Thursday at World’s End Miss Johanna Louisa Martha Rooke married Frederick William Duldig. These are the children of some of the most enthusiastic toilers of the soil in the eastern country and their farms are models of ingenuity and hard work. Machinery, horses, cows, pigs and fowls are all cared for meticulously.

The marriage was carried out in true German style. A large number of traps assembled at Mr Rooke’s at about 12 o’clock where the festive part of the ceremony took place. A start was then made for the Baldina Church. Horses, traps and whips were decorated with yards of ribbon, with green the favourite colour. An hour and ten minutes drive got the party to church. The church was handsomely decorated reflecting to the credit of Miss C. Kickebusche. The ceremony was performed by Rev. T. W. Leidig. The eight mile return trip, as is the general rule, saw drivers attempt to pass each other and the journey took only half an hour before the traps passed under a large arch made at the gate. The pedestrian entrance to the celebration was also arched and in true German style no one was admitted by five little girls dressed in white with blue sashes, until they had placed something in the hat. The seventy to eighty guests then partook of a sumptuous spread in a tent some 50-60 feet long. Singing and music followed with games and then tea, after which there was an evening of singing, recitation, music and choruses, all nicely rendered. Mr Duldig amused the gathering with his comic recitation of The Baker and Mr R. Pfitzner also entertained with his German and English recitations.

The bride was dressed in a beautiful black lustre nicely trimmed while on the crown of her head was an orange blossom wreath and a long fall almost touched the ground. At 11.30 p.m. a large spread that would have done credit to any banquet in the state was provided – the tables laden with every kind of eatable. The interior of the tent had the appearance of a magic cave. Custom places the couple under the care of their respective parents until the bride exchanges her orange blossom for a hat and the groom puts on a cap. The rest of the night passed pleasantly with refreshments constantly served, and on Friday morning visitors began to return to their homes, though some remained to complete the third day’s ceremony.

Batchelor (Hindmarsh), Mrs William Geake (Kooringa), Mrs B.T. Hancock (Petersburg) and Miss E.L. Jenkin (Kooringa).

Accident. On Thursday night, between the Court House Hotel and the Black Bridge in Aberdeen, the mail cart collided with one of Halls’ cabs. The mail cart driver, the lad P.

Over £3 was banked towards a new organ for Booborowie. £100 was raised for new furniture and renovation of the manse and to pay three year’s interest on £100 for the late Primitive Methodist Church as well as a new fence for the circuit paddock. Two years’ interest had been paid on the £50 debt at Westbury and £6-10-0 spent on repairs there and in the Copperhouse building and there was £3 in hand towards renovating the Westbury building. [Note the Copperhouse building was the old Primitive Methodist Chapel which was later bought by the Education Department for the school.]

Quite 50 years had passed since Methodism came to Redruth and its Jubilee would be celebrated on 15 June and the following days and it was hoped a genuine revival would emanate from it. The old Primitive Methodist Church building was unsafe and it had been decided to take down the west wall and lengthen the building by ten feet. The cost would be at least £130. A special effort will be made to raise the money rather than borrow it. The restored building will be known as the Methodist Jubilee Hall.

Cricket. The club met on Thursday evening at the Institute to wind up the season. The best batsman for the season was J.P. Richardson with an av. 39.9 over 22 innings. Best bowler was N.D. Keats and best fielding was by W. Tiver and J.P. Richardson, the latter was also best all-rounder. Financially the year started badly with a deficit of £3-0-3, old matting and an unsafe pitch. Now the club has a new pitch, good string matting and a good supply of tools in reasonable order. 20 matches have been played against outside teams of which 14 were won and 3 lost with 3 drawn. Finances have been difficult, but after expending £41-2-10 the club ended with a credit of 13/1. Concerts brought in £10-8-3 profit for the season.

Theft. Thomas Burns (5), Willie Henderson (6) and Norman Hammer (6) were found by M-C Grosser to have stolen two gold chains and a brooch from Mrs F. Carey’s bedroom on Thursday. On account of their ages she has declined to prosecute, but the boys say they fought over the spoils and in the scramble lost everything. It is felt unlikely that they will repeat the offence, having been suitable frightened by M-C Grosser.

Thefts. A group of four travellers was found camped at the back of the Bon Accord Hotel on Tuesday with a broken sherry bottle stolen from the bar nearby. One of their mates called Noble had earlier been caught stealing a pair of boots from J.T. Walker’s. Two others had prevailed upon someone to buy them a pair of boots each from T. Harvey’s in Aberdeen – only to turn around and try to sell the same for drinking money. The group will appear before the bench shortly.

Jubilee Hall: Memorial Stone Laying, 7 May.

The children collected £10-0-3 towards the target.

It was a bleak afternoon for the ceremony which was conducted by Rev. W.F. James. When Methodist Union was decided upon some seven years ago, it was also decided that the Primitive Methodist Church should become the Sunday school for the Redruth Methodists. Six months notice has been given to vacate the German Church in which the Methodist [Wesleyan] Sunday School has operated for about 20 years. It had been decided to take down the west wall and extend the building by ten feet and to lay six memorial stones. The mallet employed had been used to lay the foundation stone of the Church of England Hall and the Kooringa Bible Christian Manse. Stones were laid by:

For Redruth Church by Mr W.A. Rabbich

For Redruth Sunday School by Mr B. Preece

For Other churches in the Circuit by Mr J. Flower

For Kooringa Methodist Church by Mr J. Lane acting for Mr J.M. McBride

For the Salvation Army by Mr F. Harris

For the Town and District by the Mayor, Mr E.W. Crewes

Half the provisions for the tea were donated by W.R. Ridgway and the rest by subscription.

The proceedings throughout the afternoon and evening were affected by the wet weather, but still in all £50-13-3 was raised. A further £80 is needed as the trustees are determined not to increase the £200 debt on the building.

Inquest into the death of Johann Gottlieb Przibilla who was found drowned in a waterhole on Gum Creek Station on 11 May 1902. The deceased was aged 57 and was identified by his son Henry Christian Przibilla. On 9 May they were taking a team from Farrell’s Flat to Yongala and the deceased took a short cut while the informant and his brother took the team around by the road. He had taken this short cut before. He reported his father missing when he did not turn up at Canowie, 23 miles from Gum Creek, where they camped for the night. The police dragged the waterhole after finding his hat by it. Evidence from Martin William Przibilla – son of the deceased of Yongala and Christian Julius Przibilla of Farrell’s Flat attested to their father’s state of mind. Police evidence also supported accidental falling into the creek and drowning, which was the jury’s verdict.

Boer War. There was a social at the Institute on Thursday last to welcome home Cpl Gully and Trooper Sangster. It was a great success with May’s Brass band playing outside the hall and the Burra Defence Rifle Club forming a guard of honour. The Mayor, E.W. Crewes presided and gave a stirring address on The Australian Soldier. Various others spoke and the guests then graphically described some of their adventures. Others responding were F. Edwards from Petersburg & L-Cpl Harry from Adelaide. There were songs and then refreshments.

William Creek, who had been arrested for manslaughter following the death of George Stagg at the Goodwood railway crossing accident, has been released as the Crown Solicitor has declined to go on with the case.

Burra Slag Extraction Co. has ceased operations to a date to be fixed, due to the low price of copper and the poor returns from the remaining portion of the slagheap. It is somewhat surprising that the whole heap was not processed as only about a month or two of supply remained. The machinery will remain as it is thought some use might be made of it in the event of something being done with the Burra Mine property.

W. Geake was dumping some refuse into the creek [near Paradise, judging from the ‘Sparks column, page 3.] on Friday, when the horse gave one shove too many and refuse, cart, horse and all fell into the creek. Amazingly both the cart and horse were extricated without damage.

Rev. J.A.S. Williams writes a letter re the old Primitive Methodist Church in Redruth: now the Jubilee Hall. He recalls the evangelistic fervour of the late Rev. W. Jenkin and the Revs Father Wright, J.J. Salmon, A.J. Birt, S. Gray & R.J. Daddow.

Also the old veteran John Prior, Father Hutchins, Father Birt & Sam East.

The work of repairing and enlarging the hall goes on satisfactorily. Last week the extended wall and roof were finished and anxiety over the western wall and the exposed roof from a westerly gale was ended. Half the cost has been subscribed and trustees expect a speedy response and hope to finish without increasing the £200 debt on the building.

Mr Hardy moved: ‘That a deputation be appointed from this meeting to wait upon the Mayor and Council at their meeting on Monday night with a view of inducing the Council to ley the cause of the unemployed of Burra before the Government with a request that some public works be started immediately to relieve the distress throughout the town and district. [Page 2 reports that both motions were passed unanimously, though this is not said in the page 3 report.]

Mr Hardy was appointed to obtain the names of the unemployed.

Burra Town Council, 2 June.

When a deputation of the unemployed waited on the Council they were informed that the Council was sending a deputation to the Government to urge them to carry out the proposed water scheme at the Black Waterholes and to re-open the Aberdeen Ballast Quarry. Rev. W.G.M. Murphy invited the Council to attend the Peace service next Sunday afternoon at St Mary’s and this was accepted.

A Petition is circulating for the release from prison of Julius Lehman who was sentenced to three years some fifteen months ago for killing a pig on Mr Fairchild’s property. Woodman, who received two years for the same offence, was released after fourteen months. It is hoped the festivities on the conclusion of the war and the coronation will combine with the petition to make the authorities view the matter favourably.

Boer War. News reached Burra on Monday that a peace treaty had been signed in Pretoria. [On Saturday 31 May.] Flags were hoisted from housetops and other elevations and the school children were given a half-holiday.

Wilfred G.M. Murphy writes urging would be employers to drop a card to himself or Rev. W.F. James or to Mr Hardy, as they have the names of the unemployed and the card will receive immediate attention.

Black Waterholes Supply Scheme. The Commissioner gave the deputation a cordial reception and said the scheme would proceed at once provided the water proved suitable for railway purposes. He regretted the distress of the unemployed, but the water supply scheme was the only way at present out of the difficulty. A 1,000 gallon sample has been taken for testing for railway purposes.

Madame Luella will remain in town for a few days longer.

Redruth Methodist Jubilee Celebrations.

The jubilee should really have been celebrated in 1901 as the work of Methodism in Redruth began in 1851. It was resolved in preparation for the event that a history of the church be prepared and an earnest effort be made to have a genuine revival at his time and that the plan for enlarging the former Primitive Methodist Church be worked in with it.

The class meeting at 9 a.m. and the prayer meeting at 10 a.m. were marked with great fervour. The President of Conference, Rev. J. Cowperthwaite, preached at the 11 a.m. service. At 2 p.m. the keys were given to Miss Reed as Secretary of the United Methodist Sunday School to open the door to Jubilee Hall. The President and secretary of the Conference then entered with J. Tiver, Superintendent of the Sunday school and then the teachers and scholars. Rev. H.J. Pope then preached the first service to the children who were also addressed by the President. An adult service followed at 3 p.m. The evening service by Rev. Cowperthwaite was followed by a Love Feast when many testified to the saving power of the Gospel.

E.W. Crewes was unavoidably unable to preside at the banquet on Wednesday and his place was taken by the President of the Conference. At 3.30 he also presided at the Historic Meeting. Rev. W.F. James gave an historical sketch of Redruth Methodism. Rev. H.J. Pope, who laboured in the Primitive Methodist Circuit some 30 years ago also gave some reminiscences as did Mr Rabbich and N. Coombe. May’s brass band played before the tea meeting at 5.30. The enforced absence of Rev. T.B. Anguin was regretted.

Historic Sketch by W.F. James.

Rev. D.J. Draper opened the first Wesleyan Church at Kooringa in 1847 when there was no other place of worship within 70 miles. There were three Wesleyan and one or two Primitive Methodist ministers in the colony and the first two Bible Christian ministers arrived three years later. The work was done chiefly by local preachers and about 60 members were reported. Rev. John Harcourt came in 1848 and took in Princess Royal, Tothill Scrub, Kapunda and Angaston. The primitive Methodist and Bible Christian ministers later had a similar area.

Redruth first appeared in the quarterly minute book on 24 June 1851. No members are listed and the income was 5/4. Three months later there were 4 members and the circuit income was £1-6-6. In February 1851 the Kooringa trustees had begun to build a church opposite the police station and £1-17-10 was collected at the laying of the corner stone. The church cost £228. £98 was raised by subscription and the Government gave £130. Soon almost all the men went to the Victorian gold fields and for a while services continued for the women and children, but in 1854 the church was dismantled and the roof, floor, windows, doors, pulpit and seats were used for the Spring Farm Church in the Clare District. Redruth disappeared from the Burra Circuit.

In 1857 the Kooringa trustees restored the Redruth Church. Their own church had been enlarged and they utilised the old windows, pulpit and part of the roof in the new church at Redruth. £20 was raised and £130 borrowed at 10%. By 1863 the debt stood at £108. In 1865 £40 was spent on renovation and in 1874 the debt was £84. In that year the present church was erected. The old church was then sold for £5 and not a vestige of it remains.

The Sunday school began in a stable near Mr Austin’s store. Mr B. Preece, who is still alive, was the first Superintendent and Willie Torr, now Dr Torr of Way College, was one of the early scholars. The Band of Hope was a great success. Personal reminiscences mention the following people: Miss Torr (now Mrs Dale of Penzance, Cornwall), Mr Sampson of Hampton, Sammy Goss, William Torr, John & Mrs Pascoe, Mr & Mrs Goodrich, George Shirter (a Negro), Mr Davey, Charles Oldham, California Taylor, Dr Stephens, John Boddiner, Mrs Handford, George Sara, William West, A. Bartholomaeus and Rev. J.H. Goss.

31 July 1873 saw a new trust formed. The church block was bought for £100 and on 4 August it was decided to build a church to seat c. 200 and to cost c. £400. R. Rees was chosen to draw the plans and J. Tiver to supervise the work. On 3 March 1874 the tender of J. Pearce was accepted for £600. Stone laying services yielded £57 and donations totalled £150. A July bazaar yielded £102 and one in September £40 and the opening service in September £34, to total almost £400 in one year. The schoolroom, now the transept, cost £265, the seats nearly £100, so that the total was £1,340 of which £900 was borrowed at 7%. In 1879 the wall between the church and the schoolroom was taken down to make the church its present size, at a cost of £65. The debt was reduced to £360 in nine years.

For 23 years the Sunday school was held in the German Chapel.

In 1882 the corner allotment east of the church was bought for a new schoolroom at a cost of £200. £170 of this was raised by donations and a bazaar.

New seats and other expenditure brought the debt to £530 in 1884. Reduction of the debt began again and at present it stands at £122 and it is hoped to lessen it by £22 this year. Twelve years ago £616 was paid for the manse and land for the stable. £374 has been raised leaving this debt at £242. Altogether Wesleyan property at Redruth and Aberdeen has cost almost £3,000 and the total debt is £564.

A.H. Forder was treasurer for 25 years and did much to further the successful operation of the trust. A. Batholomaeus followed in his path for four years. Thirteen years ago the Burra Wesleyan Circuit was divided and Redruth became a separate circuit. The Revs T.M. Rowe, J. Hopkins, D.S. Wylie, W.A. Langsford & W.H. Rofe preceded the present minister. When the circuit was formed there were 98 members and a similar number on union, but the great number of removals has masked much good work done.

Rev. J.G. Write began Primitive Methodist services in the open air at Redruth c. 44 years ago and the church was built soon after. Its cost was £670 and when it opened £97 had been raised and £570 borrowed. (£150 at 12% and £420 at 121⁄2% to total £78 p.a.) The following June in a series of efforts to raise money £72 was collected in 5 days. In 1862 [? The 2 is unclear] the debt was £374 and for many years between £70 & £80 was raised for the trust. Few churches have been so changed without being altered in size. About 30 years ago the back and front walls had to be rebuilt at a cost of £86 and subsequently the slate roof had to be replaced with one of iron. The debt was reduced to £200 where it has remained. Some years ago the land at the corner of the street was bought for £50, but the proposed larger church was never built. The Sunday school once had 17 officers and teachers and 100 scholars and there were strong Mutual Improvement and Temperance Societies, but the church was weakened by removals. Including improvements the Methodist property at Redruth cost nearly £4,000 and its present debt is £564.

On Methodist Union in 1900 the Primitive Methodist Church in Redruth was closed. The Union involved some reluctance and it has taken the Jubilee celebrations to complete it in people’s hearts. The addition of Iron Mine and Copperhouse Primitive Methodist Churches to the circuit has strengthened it. In the 11 years before the Union the Wesleyan Circuit had a deficiency of £267 of which the Home Mission fund made up £142 and ministers salaries fell short by £125. The circuit since Union has been in credit. After Union the Primitive Methodist Church was to be the Sunday school, but this was not at once done and disrepair and interest owed both grew. Action last January saw new trustees take action and the west wall was taken down as unsafe and the building extended 10 feet to accommodate the Sunday school and it was renamed Jubilee Hall. A tender by Messrs Launder, Griffiths & Pearce was accepted. On 7 April not 1d was on hand and it was seen undesirable to increase the debt of £200 on the building. On 7 May six memorial stones were laid and £52 was raised. Since then £30 more has been raised and the trustees are anxious to receive the balance speedily.

Salvation Army. Captain Keeble, who has been in charge of the local corps for 12 months, says farewell to her Burra friends next Sunday. Her replacement is presently unknown.

The Coronation & the King’s Illness.

News was received the day before the coronation that the King was seriously ill and required an operation which was successful. [Or as the paper said so far successful] The coronation was postponed indefinitely, but expected in a few weeks if the King continued to improve in health. [It was appendicitis.]

The King’s illness caused some changes to the Children’s Demonstration, but news arrived too late to cancel it. The special addresses and hymns to be sung at the Institute had to be abandoned. The morning was cold with drizzling rain, but nothing could discourage the children on such a day, so they wound their way to the Burra School ‘with light hearts and cold feet’. Several schools held their own celebrations, but in all some 800 children assembled and marched to the Institute amid numerous flags.

The Mayor, E.W. Crewes, addressed them at Market Square and told of the changes to the program due to the illness of the King. They sang the National Anthem. They then marched to Victoria Park where various games were enthusiastically entered into. A saveloy and a roll for each child were well received. Rev. T.B. Anguin gave the address for the day. A stall had been arranged to provide refreshments for the public at everyday rates to the benefit of the Burra Jubilee Benevolent Soc. Some £10-5-0 was raised. The sun drove off the fog about lunch time and the afternoon was delightful. At about 4 p.m. the final bag of treats was handed to each child. In the evening an intercessory meeting was held and prayers offered for the King’s speedy recovery. Amusements planned were abandoned.

The Burra Jubilee benevolent Soc. benefited by £22 raised by the Band concerts and by £10 [from the Children’s Demonstration] and this money will be much needed as there is much poverty presently in the town.

At Mt Bryan East Coronation Day saw a school picnic and the children each received a coronation mug. There was a concert in the evening.

Burra Literary Soc. met on 24 June and was well attended. There was a discussion of four short papers:

Employment. M-C Grosser, as agent for the Government Labour Bureau, received notice on Saturday last to supply Bundaleer Waterworks with 20 men and on Monday 22 unemployed came forward, but yesterday he was advised that only those 21 or older could be accepted which reduced the number going to Bundaleer this morning to 15.

Burra Coursing Club. The annual meet at Gum Creek on 25 & 26 June saw some good courses run. Hares were plentiful and the club ended the day in credit £2-10-0. Full results are printed.

Theft. For some time Mr Crewes of Drew & Crewes, who has oversight of the chaff works has suspected that someone was stealing hay from the large stack at the Aberdeen chaff store. On Wednesday he and M-C Grosser set out to watch the stacks. Before they could get prepared a man was seen getting onto the haystack. He was seen to take hay and descend from the stack. M-C Grosser tried to intercept his, but he evidently saw something and fled. M-C Grosser called on him to stand in the Kin’s name, but he did not and a shot was fired by the policeman. The police followed and another shot was fired. The thief got away in the deep shadows around the railway bridge across the creek to the ballast quarry. The chase was continued and a man seen in a back yard, evidently trying to transfer suspicion to the owner of the premises, but when disturbed he ran off and was seen making for the Redruth Post Office. Tommy King, a black-tracker, was wired for. He did some clever work and is said to have confirmed a theory the police had. The habit has clearly been to drop the hay over the fence for horses to feed and they arrived before their master on this night too, ready for a feed.

Editorial on the recent death at the Burra Hospital. [See report of the inquest]

On 18 August John Stoddart who had been for some time a rabbiter at Gumbowie was brought to the hospital. He was in Petersburg for two days before being picked up by the police unconscious and locked up and charged with drunkenness. The officer admitted the deceased was very weak. He was subsequently fined 5/- which he paid. On saying he was ill he was allowed to spend a couple of hours in a cell, but was sent on his way as night approached. A couple of hours later he was found lying in the back yard of a private house and this time arrested for lunacy. He was discharged and ordered to the Burra Hospital for treatment. He died a few hours after being admitted. The post mortem showed he had a fractured skull. The vague evidence given at the inquest does not account for his movements in his last day or two at Petersburg and this needs investigation. The police do not know where he got the drink or if anyone had seen him at Petersburg. They say anyone could be beaten up at Petersburg without the police knowing. It is a thousand pities he was sent away from the police cell, for the next time the police saw him he was practically dead. This pitiable case needs to have its circumstances ventilated. [The editor clearly felt the police had acted very poorly in writing the deceased off as just another drunk without noticing any injury or concerning themselves that he might be suffering from an illness.]

Kooringa Court, 21 August.

Walter Villis charged with using indecent language in Kingston St on 18 Aug. Fined 10/- + 10/- costs.

Obituary & Inquest. Concerning the death of John Stoddart (58), sent from Petersburg on 18 August and died the same evening.

Alfred Henry Whitters, Foot-Constable:

On August 18 at about 8 p.m. found a man lying in the Petersburg subway. He smelled of drink and I arrested him and placed him in the cells. At 10 p.m. he said he felt alright and wanted a cup of tea and at 11 p.m. and 2 a.m. he seemed alright and in the morning was much better and was in court and fined 5/-. He felt weak and asked if he could lie in the cell for a couple of hours. At 5 p.m. I drew Sgt Phelan’s attention to his still being there. He was told to leave, but 30 minutes later was found lying in the backyard of a house near the police station. As he was not making sense he was again placed in the cells and at about 6 p.m. a doctor was sent for. The doctor at 6.30 said his mind was temporarily deranged by drink. On Monday [18 Aug.] he was charged with lunacy and discharged, the magistrate ordering his removal to the Burra Hospital. On the journey he seemed to improve. I handed him over to the matron and returned to Petersburg. He was not a local man and said he had no wife or relatives in Burra. He was a rabbiter selling rabbits in Petersburg and then returning to camp. There were no signs of blood and he made no complaints about being knocked about.

Several other witnesses then gave corroborative evidence.

Dr J.I. Sangster:

After John Stoddart was admitted on the order of Dr Stephenson, I received a message from matron that he was in a fit and I visited and gave instructions. An hour later I visited and convulsions again occurred and I was at his bedside when he became unconscious and died about 9 p.m.

A post mortem showed various signs of abrasions etc. and a fractured skull with bleeding in the brain. Death was due to fracture of the skull with haemorrhage on the brain and laceration of the same. The cause may have been a fall down the steps.

The jury decided it was an accidental death through falling down the steps at the Petersburg sub-by way.

Redruth Court, 29 August.

Thomas Kelly, aged 21, was charged with having no lawful visible means of support. A few days ago he arrived in Burra with his wife, formerly Miss Edith Bullen and has been staying with her parents in Kooringa, from where they had to leave yesterday. He was given till 9 a.m. the following day to leave town.

Kooringa Court, 30 August.

John Lines was charged on the information of Charles Ullmann, baker, with being unlawfully on the latter’s premises on the night of 29 August. John Lines and James Knevitt entered Ullmann’s bakehouse in Kingston St and asked for a loaf of bread. Ullmann said he didn’t have a loaf, but would give them a piece. They then entered his bedroom and bread and a candle were thrown at him and one of the two then assaulted him. Panes of his window were broken and later he noticed some buns and a white pudding were missing.

Lines was given 2 months plus 1 month for hindering police in their duty.

James Knevitt was similarly charged and was sentenced to 1 month for being unlawfully on premises, 10/- or 7 days for being drunk, £1 + 15/- costs or 14 days for indecent language and £3 or 1 month for assaulting police.

1 September.

Edward Winders was fined £5 for assaulting M-C Grosser on 30 August and a series of costs amounting in all to £6-14-6 or 2 months in prison. [Page 3 column 3: the fine was paid.]

XV, 529, 3 Sep. 1902, page 3

The Attack on Ullmann is given a more detailed account covering just over two columns.

In the case of Lines and Knevitt: Lines tried to prevent Knevitt’s arrest and had to be restrained by threat of a revolver and the constable was struck and kicked and hit over the eye and on the nose. The last mentioned blow doing considerable damage.

These two were part of a gang of youths or a ‘push’ and Hornhardt was another member who, with Winders, asked to see Knevitt the evening after he had been sentenced. When denied access Winders attacked Grosser and Hornhardt interfered. With difficulty Hornhardt was arrested and Edward Winders was later arrested in his room at the Kooringa Hotel. Hornhardt had been before the court previously which accounts for his more severe sentence.

Bundaleer Waterworks are written up in an article which concentrates on sharp practices in paying the workers. They were initially given 6/- a day and only after serving probation got 6/6. The concrete board workers were supposed to get 7/-, but had to serve a probationary period on 6/6, but there were also clearly irregularities and single men seemed to have got to the higher rates more easily because married men were less likely to leave!

Obituary. J.R Gray died at Redruth on Sunday afternoon [21 September] aged 74. For about 30 years he was the inspector for the Burra Corporation. [This cannot be correct as the Corporation only dates from 1876 and I don’t think he was the only person to hold the position, but he was a very long-serving inspector.] He carried out his duties in an eminently satisfactory manner. He was quite impartial treating all owners of stock alike whether Mayors or Councillors. He is known to have paid the fines of some poor residents from his own pocket. The excellent sanitary condition of the town is in great measure due to his insistence on his notices being carried out. In former years the inspector got part of the fines, but more recently all have gone to the Council, lest people get the idea that the inspector was discovering stray stock for personal profit. Mr Gray was well till last Wednesday, though a little pale and complaining of a slight cold. He took to his bed on Thursday. He leaves a wife and three young children, the eldest of them 4 years old. [This obituary is notable for what it omits. John Robinson Gray’s first wife was born Sarah Ann Lenton and she died in 1897. They had two children. The first was Martha Lenton Gray, well known in Burra as Nurse Woollacott who married Alexander Feltus later in life. The second was Alfred David Gray. The second marriage to Fanny Elizabeth Tohl was in 1898 when she was 23 and there were three children as stated above: John Robinson Gray (1898), Emily Helena Gray (1900) & George Hensman William (1900). Not mentioned of course was Charles Allan Gray who came along in 1903.]

An Earth Tremor struck Burra on Thursday at 6.45 a.m. and rattled stuff on shelves. On Friday at 8.15 p.m. a second and more serious earthquake shook the town and seemed worse at Kooringa than in Redruth. Some crockery was broken in falling from shelves and a large pane in one window shattered. People ran into the streets and some stayed outside all night. Part of a ceiling collapsed where a woman had been sitting till a moment before. At the Institute a performance of Marionettes was not interrupted, apparently the audience was so rapt in the performance. There was a sound like thunder which seemed to travel from west to east.

Burra Show on 24 September was a great success, though the morning was windy and dusty. The afternoon was somewhat better. Attendance was good with a gate of £63, down £3 on last year. Side shows and Cheap Jacks were more numerous. Not so much agricultural produce was entered, but good dairy produce. Poultry numbers were down because young birds were omitted this year. Draught stock was well represented as were ponies. Cattle were not plentiful and dogs about the same as last year. Mr Duncan’s Berkshire boar was an attraction and the largest ever seen in the town at about 550 lb. It had also got first prize at the recent Adelaide Show. Implements and vehicles were well shown; especially notable were the vehicles of Mr Maxwell of Manoora. C. & W. Oppermann had their own way in vegetables. Flowers were poor: no doubt due to the bad season.

C. Morgan, who carried on a bakery business for many years in Burra, has purchased the goodwill of Mr W. Ullmann’s business and intends to carry on the business in his own name.

Obituary. ‘Little Jacky’ Elder, the son of Adjutant and Mrs Elder died on Wednesday afternoon last of inflammation of the lungs and bronchitis. The funeral on Thursday afternoon was conducted by Ensign Giles. Rev. T.B. Anguin offered prayers and Sister Ward and Brother C. Morgan spoke. The Salvation Army marched under its flag to the cemetery. A memorial service will be conducted at the Barracks on Sunday evening. [John Gordon Fuller Elder was born 8 December 1901 and died 1 October 1902.]

Burra Defence Rifle Club. With rifle shooting coming to the fore again Messrs Urwin & Sons have presented another clock, L. Gebhardt a silver cup, and Capt. J.A. Watt a rifle. The club would be second to none if the Government supplied better rifles and ammunition.

Cricket. Burra Cricket Club met last week with a fair attendance and elected Hon. J. Lewis as Patron, P.R. Scott as Secretary, J. Drew as captain and Rev. Reddan as Vice-Captain. Subscription set at 7/6.

Redruth Methodist Jubilee Fair: the committee revealed on 2 October that they had raised £52-13-0.

Mr Przibilla swore that 12 articles found with John Foster when he was arrested were those stolen from him. Such a recovery of stolen items does not often occur.

Rain is still desperately needed. The drying north winds have caused the surface to become very hard. Some farmers will not even recover seed wheat for next year.

Mr Ullmann has been completely shattered by the recent assault and having lived alone in the baking business for over 33 years, has not had a complete night’s rest since. He is going to Pt Pirie for a few weeks and then on to Germany via Sydney.

XV, 534, 8 Oct. 1902, page 3

Itinerants. An article complains about an influx of ‘Weary Willies’ and the consequent drunkenness and use of bad language in the town.

The bakery recently bought by C. Morgan has been run by a bachelor for a long time. Mr Slime had no wife and was also subject to an assault before returning to Germany. Mr Ullmann never married and now Charley Morgan, another bachelor, has the premises.

The Clare Dramatic Club production of Our Regiment on Show Night was done remarkably well and the door taking was £28.

E.A. Ward writes a memorial poem to ‘Little Jack’ which is published in column 2.

Points for places in matches to be 1st 5, 2nd 4, 3rd 3.

When a competitor reaches 15 he must decide either to take the rifle or go on for the next trophy, forfeiting rights to the rifle and any points, and so forth.

In the first match: P.A. Roach 90, J.E. Pearce 88, C. Parks 90*, J.F. Martin 87.

* C. Parks’ score was reduced by three because he used a .303 rifle.

The Rifle Club and the Cricket Club met at Vivian’s Hotel on Thursday and finalised arrangements for the picnic and sports meeting at Princess Royal next Wednesday. (Which will be observed as a holiday by 13 storekeepers.)

Dogs have attacked and killed sheep on Princess Royal in the last day or so.

Obituary. Mrs Theresa Symes, a long time resident of Burra, has died at the home of her daughter, Mrs Neville, aged 68. [Died 9 October 1902]

Redruth Methodist Circuit Quarterly Meeting revealed that over £300 has been raised in the last 18 months for new work, repairs and debt reduction. A loan of £110 from the Loan Fund was approved for Jubilee Hall.

Booborowie Methodist Church. The 11th Anniversary was held on Sunday & Monday last.

‘Rev. W.F. James preached the sermons, and gave an Olla Podrida Monday evening.’* Proceeds from the services and the tea meeting were the largest for ten years.

* An Olla Podrida is a medley or hotch potch.

Foxes are becoming plentiful in the South East of SA and are occasionally seen in the North. Some contend they do more good than harm by destroying rabbits.

A Motor Cycle. An article reports the arrival of a motorcycle in Burra on Thursday. A young lady reported seeing a bicycle that had bolted. [There is no indication of who was either the owner or rider.]

Kooringa Methodist Church Anniversary will be honoured on Sunday 19 October with the presence of Sir F.W. Holder and Rev. W. Jeffries. Sir Frederick will also preside at Monday’s tea meeting. Rev. Jeffries will give a lecture on Wednesday 22 October on Character. This was billed as ‘A real Elocutionary Treat’ which has attracted crowds elsewhere.

Elder, Smith will offer 8,400 sheep on 17 October.

Obituary. Theresa Symes, aged 68, mother of Mrs William Neville, died leaving three daughters and two sons.

The John Foster arrested for breaking into Mr Przibilla’s at Mt Bryan, turns out actually to have been Charles Chapman, formerly a bookkeeping teacher.

The season. The prospects in the Hundreds of Schumburg [sic] and Lindley are particularly bad with so little rain there is virtually no wheat up and little more grass. Some farmers have lost all their horses and around Morgan things are worse if anything.

[These are the two most easterly Hundreds in the County of Burra and lie towards Morgan. The Hundred of Schomburgk has since 1918 been called Maude.]

The Inspectorship. Since the death of J.R. Gray the overseer has been doing his work, but since he goes where cows and horses don’t, he has found no strays.

Court.

There were a series of cases in 1902 involving men not giving proper notice of moving stock or of not moving their stock the required distance.

One trick was to take sheep to market and not be successful at selling them and then walk them back. One could also arrange to sell them to another family member with like results. The lack of feed in a bad season no doubt encouraged such ruses. The lawyers were also involved in finding technical flaws in the documents drawn up etc.

A Motor Vehicle? It was rumoured that a motorcar would arrive at the Burra Station on Friday night so a number of people went to see it. One young couple talked so intently that they almost got to Copperhouse before turning back and a drover’s turn-out passed them with a clatter of pots and pans dangling about. They identified this as the motor, but their friends back in town had seen nothing.

Burra United Friendly Societies’ Sports Committee has begun making plans for the sports day at Christmas.

Burra Defence Rifle Club. Results of the match on 15 & 18 October: J. Drew 87, C. Parks 86, & S. Walker 86.

Kooringa Methodist Church Anniversary passed off very successfully both with respect to attendance and finances. Sir F.W. Holder preached the afternoon service and the Rev. W. Jeffries took the other two.

Another Motor Vehicle? There is an obscure article about a locally made vehicle of some sort which is described as a motorised wheat truck or wheelbarrow. It is obviously a joke, but the basis of it is unclear.

A concert to benefit Mr C. Pressick was given at the Institute last night.

The old Princess Royal Mine was offered for sale in Adelaide yesterday.

Sir F.W. Holder is spending a few days at Mongolata with Mr H.S. Stevens. [More likely with Horace Steele Stephens – his brother-in-law.]

Burra Town Council considered the 29 applications for the Inspectorship on Monday, and appointed J.F. Martin: effective at once.

Editorial congratulating J.F. Martin on being appointed Inspector and offering some advice on the carrying out of his duties.

Burra Defence Rifle Club & Burra Cricket Club’s picnic and sports went off on Wednesday, but for some reason the attendance was not large and the takings were therefore disappointing. The shops and public school closed for the occasion and the Burra Band played during the day. The results are printed.

Court, 21 October.

Stewart McWaters v. Messrs Kubale Long & Co. over a contract for the sale of chaff. The verdict was for the defendant. [Report extends just over 1 column.]

XV, 537, 29 Oct. 1902, page 3

Court.

John Lewis proceeded against Elliot Camp on the grounds of trespass for £1, but as the defendant was not actually seen on the property and had witnesses to say he had not been there, the case collapsed.

Ettie Walhert was charged on the information of Carrie Jones with the theft of a gold ring valued at 15/-. The defendant said she found the ring near the Church of England. Mrs Jones alleged it was taken from her house, but in her evidence revealed that the ring had been found by her little boy some two months before. The case was dismissed and the ring held with a view to finding its rightful owner.

Theft. There is a complicated story concerning the theft of a bicycle from Mr Richards’ shop by a young man giving the name of H. Wyman. The police eventually recovered the bicycle, but to this date had not got their man.

Burra Slag Extraction Co. Work has now ceased with all the slag treated. Most men have been dismissed and the works almost abandoned. A few are dismantling minor structures that will not be needed again. It is said every particle of copper has been taken from the finings now left.

Black Waterholes Scheme. 1,500 gallons of water are being sent from Wandillah to the city for testing for boiler use.

Guy Fawkes Night. The kiddies have prepared a number of Guys as up-to-date effigies, but the editor thinks ‘Guy Fawkes Day however, like St Valentine’s Day, is fast becoming extinct as far as interest in it is concerned.’

Burra Defence Rifle Club. Rifle shooting for the clock, cup and rifle continued on 29 Oct. & 1 Nov. with the first three being: J. Drew 98, J.A. Pearce 89 and A. Bennetts 88.

The Pressick Fund Treasurer, R.M. Harvey, is desirous of getting in all subscription lists by next Friday.

Mrs Jones’s gold ring referred to in court last week, has turned out to be instead one of Isaac Newton’s – the American auctioneer – who sold them at 1/- each and which turned black after wearing.

Redruth Methodist Sunday School Anniversary next Sunday, Monday & Wednesday. Rev. Alfred H. Carne of Terowie will preach and the service of song Only a Waif will be rendered.

The Walhert & Jones ring saga is gone over again in exhaustive detail in rather more than a column.

Bagot, Shakes & Lewis will offer 6,520 sheep on 7 November.

Court.

‘Joseph Ford was charged on the information of J. Morgan with unlawfully depasturing sheep on Crown Lands. Plea not guilty. Francis Ford said he gave instructions to Ah Shang to drive sheep from the station to Wandillah paddock, but the sheep got boxed with others. Ah Shang, who didn’t know the Bible from any other book, and didn’t seem to display any anxiety about being sworn, said – I go along a road, see, sheep get em mix, see, doon no ’ow get em box long other sheep, see. Sheep go away from Misr. Ford’s 8 or 10 clock, cum back by-and-by 4 or 5 o’clock.

The Bench thought they had enough evidence from Ah Shang to inflict a penalty of £1 and costs.

Salvation Army. Major Cummings, Divisional Officer for the North, visited Burra on Sunday and conducted services. On Monday evening he lectured on Java and Its People.

Court.

There is a one column account of a case over the theft of 1/9 worth of rope involving E.J. Burns alias James Brown and a lad called John Willis. Burns/Brown was fined 30/- or 7 days. Willis, who was only a young lad, had actually taken the rope, but the JPs decided that Burns/Brown was the responsible party in a case of conspiracy. Willis was let off with a warning.

Redruth Court.

A few hours after the McWaters v. Kubale case had been heard about three yards of the court house ceiling fell down. The building needs urgent repairs. Large cracks in the wall admit water and make the wall damp for yards. The windows are unworkable, the furniture needs attention and the general interior condition is disagreeable.

A Choral Competition was held in the Institute on Monday, organised by G.E. Dane. The attendance was good. First prize went to Miss C. Killicoat and Mr N. Pearce in the choral competition. Mr N.J. Tiddy and Mr J. Davey’s quartette tied for 2nd with Mr M. Collins’s quartette 3rd.

Obituary. The death is announced of Mr John McDonald. [Corrected in the next issue to Mr Donald McDonald.] The deceased was returning from delivering a message to The Gums Station and called at the residence of Mr W. Hills to get some furniture. He could not then ride in the cart and so walked along side. He got food at O’Brien’s on Sunday 26 October about 6.30 p.m. and then apparently fell over an embankment in the dark. Search parties set out on Sunday, but failed to find him. [Apparently this was on 2 November.] On Monday Mr J.C. Sandland found the body, much decomposed after one week. He is believed to have been washed about 100 yards down the creek by recent rain. His horse travelled on about a further 11⁄2 miles with a dog before coming to grief in Baldina Creek, where it may have lived until drowned in heavy rains on Friday night. The flow from which half covered it with sand. McDonald was aged c. 58 and was well known in the district, having worked on both Caroona and The Gums and been employed on several holdings as a boundary rider and general hand.

[See next issue for comments re other deaths along this stretch of road.]

[Note: it is evident that he was returning via the eastern road and not the main Burra-Morgan Road as would be more usual – at least now. The death was registered for 2 November and the aged given as 55.]

Only a Waif was sung to a crowded church on Sunday afternoon last and will be repeated by request next Sunday.

Obituary. Mrs [H.C.W.] Fuss, aged 85, and a resident of Burra for over 50 years, has died, leaving 1 daughter, Mrs Greenwood (Umberalana) and six sons, Herman (Moonta), Albert (Orroroo), Frederick (Broken Hill), William (Goodwood) and Charles & August (Burra). [Born Lutz 16 or 18 June 1817 and registered as Johanne Christiana Friedericke Fuss at death on 4 November 1902.]

Guy Fawkes was effectively burnt in effigy on Wednesday last with the addition of rockets and crackers.

Baldina Creek has become notorious for deaths: Donald McDonald’s, reported last week, was the fifth. Others were Messrs John Dolman, McNeil and O’Brien, while a traveller hung himself not far away.

[Daniel O’Brien died in a capsize of a spring cart at Baldina Creek, see XV, 258, 23 Aug. 1893, Page 3.

## Unidentified man found hanging in a hut at the Township of Douglas; see VII, 497, 1 December 1885 Page 2.]

## Redruth Reformatory.

Observations on the Reformatory. On entering the gate we noticed the grounds are laid out with fruit and olive trees and on the southern side a vegetable garden is cultivated where a large number of cabbages etc. are grown. Flowers are also conspicuous so the approach to the building is pleasing. We entered through the small ‘cut-out door’. Inside all was scrupulously clean and tidy. The rooms are commodious and well ventilated and all goes to show the inmates are zealous and industrious.

A Severe Dust Storm struck the town last Wednesday and from morning till night the visibility was minimal and at times it was impossible to see more than a yard. The dust permeated every house however tightly closed up.

XV, 540, 19 Nov. 1902, page 3

Booborowie Sports will be held this time on New Year’s Day rather than Christmas Day.

Mr J. Linkson has, through failing eyesight, had to give up his business after c. 15 years in the Redruth Store. He will undergo a course of treatment in the city which we hope will be successful.

Burra School held its visiting day on Monday and ‘the children were put through their facings’ [?] by the headmaster, Mr F. Fairweather, and acquitted themselves very well. The modern system seems to induce the students to study their lessons with much interest. Unfortunately the school is short staffed due to economic circumstances. The school was addressed by Rev. T.B. Anguin and Dr Sangster, Chairman of the School Board of Advice, distributed certificates.

Redruth Methodist Sunday School Anniversary. The Rev. Alfred H. Carne of Terowie preached and gave the connective readings for the service of song, Only a Waif. The picnic at Koonoona on Monday 10 November was largely attended. The amusements were efficiently directed by Mr C. Fuss who has rendered a like service for several years. The dust storm on Wednesday 12 November seriously reduced attendance at the tea and public meeting where J. Tiver JP presided. Scholars number 92 boys and 81 girls (173) with an average attendance of 39 in the mornings and 109 in the afternoon. The annual teachers’ social took place in Jubilee Hall on 13 November.

Redruth Reformatory Fires. Fire broke out in the reformatory laundry last Wednesday morning and destroyed the wood and iron building. In the afternoon a second fire started in ‘Hope Dormitory’ which burned all the girls’ clothes and the contents of five or six kerosene boxes used as a sort of cupboard. There is no doubt the first fire started accidentally from the old German Ironing Box [i.e. a box-iron]. The iron was left on the floor with the coals black and apparently dead. Hettie Garrad had been using it and said she had known fire to fall out of the box onto the clothes while ironing. The wind had opened the door several times on the morning in question. The fire in the dormitory in the afternoon is more mysterious. The girls eventually put it out by removing a ventilator and sheet of iron from the roof and using a hose.

The inquest as reported says strangely little about the second fire and seems to assume it was from a spark of the first fire, though about five hours later in appearing.

The full report runs to a little over 1 column.

Elder, Smith & Co. will offer 6,410 sheep on 21 November.

The Bisley targets were used for the first time and seem to have reduced the scores. Many complained that the bull’s eye was hard to see at long range.

## The Pressick Fund. The philanthropic friends of Mr C. Pressick have donated various amounts to total about £50 of which £23 will go to pay the premiums on a life policy due to mature in 1906. The balance will be paid in a weekly allowance. Mr C. Pressick thanks all friends for coming to his aid in his present affliction.

E.W. Crewes, the Mayor, has been quite ill and confined to bed for a couple of days, but is now getting about again for a short time each day.

Reminiscences of the District Synod. By J.B. [This, I presume, stands for Rev. J. Blacket.]

He recounts early Burra history and says he left Angaston on top of Hill & Co.’s coach and drove on good roads to Nuriootpa, changed horses at Greenock and then went on to Roseworthy via Freeling. The northern express then took him to Burra. At the station he got a cab with various others and set off. They went to the Reformatory and then on to the Methodist parsonage. He was supposed to get off at a friend’s place in Redruth, but ended up staying the night with T.W. Wilkinson. In the morning he climbed the hill for a view of the town.

‘The wisdom of those who encouraged tree planting on so large a scale is to be commeded. [sic] What a desolate looking place the town would be without its trees!’

He was then eventually transferred to his host, Mr R. Reed of Redruth.

One morning before synod work started he went over the old mine.

‘What a busy scene Burra must have presented! Where all is now death (with the exception of a few men delving in the soil.)’

‘By the way, a few lamps along the street in which the Institute stands would be of service. The darkness in places was such that a careful “lookout” had to be kept to avoid collision with other pedestrians.’

Obituary. Mrs Phelan, wife of M-C Phelan of Redruth has died leaving a husband and seven children, the eldest of whom is 16 years old. [Born Bridget Ellen Quirk, died 21 November 1902 aged 47.]

Obituary. Mr John O’Leary Senior has died aged 82. His wife died in April. Rev. Father Haendl officiated. He leaves five sons and two daughters. [Died 20 November 1902 aged 82.]

Rev. W.F. James preached a sermon at Redruth on 16 November, taking as his text, James III.5 ‘Behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth.’ He was inspired by the Reformatory fire. The core idea was how great is the power of the tongue, for good or evil. It is reported in 3⁄4 column.

XV, 541, 26 Nov. 1902, page 3

Court.

Among others Thomas Woollacott was fined £1-2-6 for allowing his cow and horse to stray.

[This is an unusually large amount: but then he was a frequent visitor to court for this offence.]

Thomas Bewley reported to M-C Grosser on Monday that two of his horses had been stabbed. One was dead and the other not so badly cut and will probably survive. An investigation showed that they had in fact rolled on broken glass.

Offence. Two mischievous little girls visited the Redruth Reformatory fowl house the other day and smashed a number of valuable eggs on which ducks were setting. Prosecution of Clara Carpenter and Florrie Jones is being considered.

St Mary’s Annual Strawberry Fete at the Institute last Friday was opened by Hon J. Lewis who was congratulated by Rev. W.G.M. Murphy on his election to the Legislative Council. The nett proceeds of c. £70 will benefit the Building Fund.

XV, 542, 3 Dec. 1902, page 2

Harvest is now underway, but wheat yields will be low and the haymaking has finished with but poor results.

Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting was held in the Institute on Wednesday evening last.

The Mayor’s Report.

Mr Crewes expressed regret at the death of the late Mayor, Mr Alex. Harris and of the late Inspector, J.R. Gray, who had been replaced by Mr J.F.N. Martin, selected from 28 candidates. The council had worked well and amicably in the last year.

Major Works:

East Ward: considerable kerbing and path forming in Kingston, Ayers and Bridge Sts and the bridges had been painted. The trough in Market Square had been tarred and painted. The pump had been repaired. Footpaths in Kingston and Chapel Sts had been tar dressed etc. etc.

West Ward: considerable amount of tar dressing has been done in Chapel St, Queen St, & Commercial St. The bridge in Church St was put in order etc. etc.

North Ward: footpath work in Truro and Ludgvan Sts and kerbing in Ludgvan and St Dye Sts. A culvert at Roach Town was repaired as was a bridge in Sancreed St. The Young St Ford was lowered to better carry floods and to drain stagnant water. Footpath in Best Place was tar dressed. Water trough opposite the Exchange Hotel was raised on new stands, tarred and painted etc. etc.

The Council began the year with a debit of £8-14-5 and at the last meeting was in credit £54-4-9. The rates for the year had brought in £300-4-11.

North Ward lamps had cost £7-14-0 and those in East Ward £9-9-0 and West Ward lamps also cost £9-9-0.

In the parklands dead trees have been removed and replaced, but numbers of young trees have been deliberately pulled up and taken away by person or persons unknown. Some trees have died due to the dry season. Pepper trees planted opposite Jubilee Avenue have done well. Altogether over 300 trees were planted during the year.

In the cemetery shrubs have been planted and the wall repaired.

Burra Waterworks.

The plant remains in good order with no breakdowns this year. Much is due to the spare boiler and good work of the engineer, Mr Prior. The present reservoir of 33,000 gallons is however, too small. A larger one was considered this year, but deferred pending a Government response on the Black Waterholes supply. The second lot of water for testing from that source has been condemned as unsuited for locomotives and so the scheme has had to be given up. A new reservoir of 200,000 gallons would cost about £300 which would last the town several days and save on extra labour being needed in summer and could be financed without increasing the rates. In the year Council tried to get the capital account and rates reduced, but were unsuccessful. The plant is now valued at £8,104-11-10 and the rate is 4%. Mr William Pryor is still in charge. [Note: it was Prior earlier in the report.] The balance in the bank is currently £74-3-11.

Health

The town remains healthy with only a few cases of typhoid this year. We were unable to get a new site for a rubbish depot as desired as the owners would neither sell nor rent.

XV, 542, 3 Dec. 1902, page 3

W.J. Davey gave a long speech in support of his candidacy for East Ward, but much of it was little to the point. He did however, favour economy and commonsense and other motherhood issues. He was also in favour of kerbing and further tar dressing, if it were done better, as the present process was a waste of money. He was strongly against the rule that work in a ward was only available to men that lived in that ward. West Ward had only 2 or 3 out of work ever and had the most money to spend. East Ward had 10 or 12 men out of work who could not get work in West Ward!

Using rubble instead of road metal was penny wise and pound foolish. The title to the cemetery road was needed and it needed improving. The path to the Post Office was badly lit and if the cost was not too great he would like to see two lamps placed along it. The cemetery needed to be made more presentable. He thought the slaughterhouse question, which had been sleeping all year, needed to be resolved. He favoured trees in parklands etc. He congratulated the Mayor on three successful terms and would have liked him to have had a fourth. He also congratulated the Mayor-elect and was sure he would do his duties satisfactorily with his 14 years experience of Council. He was the nominee of no party and would vote independently.

The paper reports suggest that no other candidate spoke much to the point.

Burra Electro-Magnetic Separation Works. Trial runs have begun. So far the machinery has run satisfactorily, though some adjustments are being made. It is expected only 12 men will be employed to work the three shifts and it should be going before Christmas.

The Unicorn Brewery, run for many years by Mr Banks and then by Mr E.C. Lockyer, has amalgamated with the Walkerville Brewery. Local hotels will now be served from Walkerville.

Burra Town Council has decided rates will have to rise, but the exact figure is yet to be decided.

Duty Stamp Warning. Receipts for sums of £2 and upwards now attract a 1d duty stamp. People are entitled to demand a receipt and one will not be deemed valid as proof of payment without the duty stamp. Postage stamps must not be used.

Kooringa Methodist Church will stage a Limelight Evening in lieu of a bazaar in the Lecture Hall on Thursday night. The plates have taken 12 years to collect by Mr Anguin and use an expensive toning system now discontinued due to its cost. [Advt. on next page gives price as 1/- or a few chairs at 2/-.]

Cr Lockyer said at the declaration of the poll that he should have had 100 votes, but not if his knowledge of North Ward finances is any criterion. He said that North Ward was slightly overdrawn by c. 30/-. In fact the amount is £9-13-9!

‘Beer & Oysters for Two’ writes expressing his dismay that the town has elected two brewers to the Town Council.

North Ward Finances. An article asks Cr Lott of East Ward how, if the ward was allotted £80-14-1 and spent £80-10-1, it ended up £2-12-8 in credit and how was the credit balance of £9-13-1 from the previous year spent?

[The editor seems to have suddenly grown much more alert about Council matters since losing the election!]

Thomas Burns, presently working on the Bundaleer Waterworks, got poisoned recently from tinned fish. He vomited copiously, body and limbs swelled largely and red spots and blotches appeared on his body. He was sent to the Burra Hospital, but recovered quickly.

W.H. March, also working at Bundaleer, is in Burra Hospital suffering from a haemorrhage of the lungs and was very ill, but hopes are entertained of his recovery.

Salvation Army. The annual demonstration in connection with Junior Soldiers took place at the Barracks last Sunday and on Monday evening the prizes for good behaviour and attendance were distributed.

XV, 544, 17 Dec. 1902, page 3

Cricket. The first half of a match between North and South ends of the town began last Saturday at Victoria Park. So far: South 294 and North 2 for 77.

Rev. T.B. Anguin’s Limelight Evening last Thursday proved an unqualified success. The pictures were the best ever seen here: each one was brilliantly clear.

The Sunshine Bazaar & Xmas Tree will be held in the Methodist Lecture Hall on Friday and will be opened by Dr Sangster jun. at 3 p.m. Afternoon tea 6d and a musical program in the evening. Admission 3d and children 1d. Proceeds to the Burra Hospital.

Booborowie DC has decided to donate all fines recovered from drovers for not bona fide travelling over Crown Lands – amounting to £18-19-0 – to the distressed farmers’ seed wheat fund. The past six or seven seasons have been much against farmers both from rain and other causes.

Burra Town Council accepted an invitation from Rev. T.B. Anguin to attend church next Sunday.

W. Geake’s tender for the lamp lighting in Kooringa was accepted.

Mr Neville’s tender for lamp lighting in North Ward was accepted.

The main road grant has been cut the coming year to £273. [In 1902 £306 and 1901 £373.]

Burra DC has had its main road grant cut to £506.

E.C. & H.C. Lockyer complain that the Unicorn Brewery is not dead as stated last week and that:

‘As a matter of fact negotiations are pending.’

‘You need not say the Walkerville wants to come in with us, but merely state we have been approached.’

Later J.E.H. Winnall sent a solicitor’s letter demanding a retraction and contradiction of the story – a totally unnecessary letter as we had already agreed to do so with the Lockyers.

Weather. Monday was dusty and windy. At 12 o’clock on Tuesday a thunderstorm dropped over 1” in half an hour. In Market Square water could not get away and flooded the footpath at F. Harris’s shop. Thunder and lightning continued and some roads and footpaths were damaged. The creeks came down and standing wheat was damaged.

Redruth can boast a band now.

Mr Midwinter bought the property of the late Mrs [H.C.W.] Fuss.

Salvation Army. Adjutant & Mrs Elder are on holiday and Lieut. Dawson fills the gap.

J. Linkson has gone to Adelaide for treatment for his eyes.

Burra School. It is really too much to expect the head teacher with two or three assistants to attend satisfactorily to the needs of between 300 and 400 children.

XV, 545, 24 Dec. 1902, page 2

Editorial on Xmas.

Not much is said of substance. He has hopes for the Electro-magnetic Works and for the mine itself and some hopes that farming might pick up now that the seven year drought has broken.

Church Parade last Sunday. The Corporation and Friendly Societies attended and Rev. T.B. Anguin officiated. The Burra Band led the march from the Institute to the Kooringa Methodist church where the Burra Orchestra assisted in the service.

An Incident with a Cow.

Following the recent rains a cow got into the yard at the rear of Hunter’s Boot Palace and venturing too close to a ‘Private building’ caused a collapse, trapping itself there overnight. It was extricated with some difficulty and had to exit the premises through the shop.

XV, 545, 24 Dec. 1902, page 3

Messrs Luxmore, R.J. Coombes & Co. have sent a letter with some useful sketches showing the correct way to stretch rabbit skins for sale. In addition there are illustrations showing the correct methods for kangaroo, opossum, hare and sheepskins. See the sketches at this office.

The Bazaar organised by Miss Moffitt’s Class and the Sunshine Workers’ Band was held in the Kooringa Methodist Lecture Hall on Friday. Mr Dawes of Princess Royal sent a Christmas tree. The bazaar raised £15-7-4 for the Hospital and the children decided to spend it on an armchair with sedan-like handles for conveying patients up the hospital steps and on other items.

Cricket. Last Saturday, junior teams on the school flat:

Kooringa 29 & 79 (108)

Aberdeen 16 & 71 (87)

The match between North and South was concluded on 20 December:

South 294 defeated North 232.

The Storm of 16 December: Further Reports.

The water rushing down the creek near Dr Sangster’s flowed over the Commercial St bridge and then down the street to flood Market Square. The thunder continued to roll and the lightning was the most vivid for years. Footpaths on Market Square were flooded and mud covered the flagstones. Some houses in the lower part of the town were flooded. A washaway on the train line at Yunta delayed the Broken Hill train until late on Wednesday evening. Over 3” of rain fell at Springbank.

At Leighton one resident had about 30 turkeys drown and another lost a number of fowls and several settings of eggs. Dead rabbits were left along Burra Creek.

House gutters overflowed into rooms in several places.

A farmer at the west of town lost 20-30 bags of wheat down the creek and another lost several pigs. Around the district the loss of sheep is considerable. Mr Duldig at World’s End had left a plough and scoop in the nearby creek after dam work and the former was swept 600 yards and the latter a mile. He lost 6 chains of fencing to rushing water. Over 2” fell in the afternoon and another 1” at night.

A good crop of mushrooms has followed the rain on Flagstaff.

Fuss’s house of eight rooms at Redruth is to let.

XV, 546, 31 Dec. 1902, page 2

W. Martin’s condition has deteriorated and he has been moved from home to the hospital. The haemorrhage from the lungs continues.

Salvation Army. Adjutant Elder, Mr James Chynoweth (an old Burra Boy on a visit) and Brother White, another visitor, provided entertainment on Saturday and Sunday at Army gatherings.

Christmas Holidays.

Christmas Eve began by being windy and dusty, but towards evening grew calmer and cool. The streets were filled with the usual Christmas crowds. The Burra Band played around the shops as usual. Christmas Day was fine and passed off quietly. Boxing Day was more exciting with sports in the Park which attracted a crowd. Various cricket matches were played and picnics organised.

Obituary. Mr Townsend, an old Burra identity, died last week in Burra Hospital.

[George Townsend died 19 December aged 78.]

XV, 546, 31 Dec. 1902, page 3

The Burra Branch of the Dressmaking Class went into recess on Friday afternoon. There are 86 members on the roll and Mrs Ainley from the School of Mines was present to examine the work which reflects well on the teacher, Miss Summerton. The students have done well over the twelve months, but Mrs Ainley was sorry to see no equivalent class for boys.

Annual United Friendly Societies’ Sports were held at Victoria Park on Boxing Day in excellent weather and a great many people in consequence turned out. The Burra Band led a procession of the lodge members from the Institute to the Park at about 10 o’clock. The gate takings were c. £40; the highest for several years. The results are printed.

In the evening the Gawler Dramatic Society staged Parted from Life in the Institute before a good house.

Salvation Army. Adjutant and Mrs Elder will bid farewell to the Burra corps on 8 January. They have endeared themselves to a large circle of friends. The Adjutant is an expert at the much despised concertina, but also a good singer. He leaves the local corps in splendid order.

Hanson Methodist Sunday School Anniversary 21 & 25 December. Rev. W.F. James and Mr E.W. Crewes preached to crowded congregations.

Nearly 200 attended the tea meeting on Christmas Day which was followed by supper. The entire proceeds were about £11, of which £6 will go to the building fund which has now raised £74, including £14 worth of promised labour.

Booborowie Sports tomorrow.

Obituary. Captain J.W. White died in his home in East St on Monday. He had worked for the Burra Mines for some years. Aged 77, he leaves a wife and grown-up family. [James Williams White died 29 December n1902 aged 77.]

Characteristics of the 1902 Paper

The paper began much as it had been in 1901.

Page 1.

Large advertisements: larger not local in origin.

Page 4.

Large advertisements and, as for 1901, patent medicines were a common subject.

There seems to have been a great demand for constipation pills and a concern for itchy piles.

There are smaller, but sustained, advertisements for Chamberlain’s Colic and Cholera and Diarrhoea Remedy. One must feel for Mr C.B. Wingfield of Fair Play Mo. USA, who suffered chronic dysentery for 35 years before finding this cure!

Pages 2 & 3

Here we get the usual smaller advertisements, Council notices and stock sales advertising and the like. Then comes the news, but this is increasingly interspersed with small print adverts and humorous stories and jokes which in some issues extend for over one column.

‘Sparks’ continues and is less cryptic than in some earlier years.

Even under ‘Current Topics’, which had traditionally been the heading for local news, it is annoying to find articles that turn into jokes or even advertisements. By July the heading was gone and the mixture of other items more than ever intruded on news. But this is quite inconsistent and in most issues news still had the dominant role.

There was much less news from other district correspondents than had been common earlier.

Serials continued to be a feature of the paper.

Any sign of an editorial point of view was hard to find and editorials were rare. Even the Mayor’s report on the year’s activity by Council was published without editorial comment.

Numbering of issues in 1902

Volume XV continued for the whole year, having started 7 December 1892.

The year began with Volume XV Number 496 on 1 January 1902

And continued to Volume XV Number 546 on 31December 1902

Numbering was fairly consistent, but there were a few anomalies.

496, 514 & 516 were used twice and 517 was not used.

New Year’s Pranks.

Some of the lads who in earlier years indulged in New Year’s Eve larks were asked why they refrained this year and why a footbridge or the like was not displaced replied: ‘Oh! The bloomin’ Council didn’t appoint any ‘Specials’ to have a bit of fun with.’

The Council seems to have learnt that such appointments were looked on as something of a farce and realised there are better ways of spending £3.

‘Whip’ reports that at the Terowie Sports on 1 January ‘Dick’ Gully won the three mile bicycle handicap and A.F. Heinrich was 2nd with O. Baynes 3rd. Baynes won the one mile event and came second in the two mile with Heinrich second and ‘Dick’ Gully third.

Weather for the holidays was pleasant and many went to the Booborowie Sports or to the World’s End Races on 1 January.

World’s End Races on 1 January were very successful and six events were contested. The Maidens and The Handicap were won by T. O’Dea’s The Norman, though some people are saying he was ineligible for the former given his striking resemblance to old Trentalto! Results are printed.

XV, 547, 7 Jan. 1903, page 3

Booborowie Sports saw a record gate and proved an immense success. The gate was over £21. Even the old time tug-of-war proved very exciting with the knot in the rope stationary for 1 minute 50 seconds. The results are printed. Apart from pedestrian and cycle races there was tilting, pick-a-back race, cotton winding contest, three-legged race, putting the weight and tossing the caber. A ball followed.

Westbury Methodist Church Anniversary was held on 28 December & 1 January. Proceeds exceeded £13. In the last 18 months over £26 has been spent on repairs and interest. The interior of the church will be renovated immediately.

F.J. Martin, Inspector since the death of J.R. Gray, has resigned, having secured the management of Moralina Station 200 miles from Burra. He was one of the firm of auctioneers, W.P. Reed & Co, and was identified with sports and the Burra Defence Rifle Club. Elias Wilks has been appointed Inspector for one month.

J.H. Dawes, who has had oversight of Princess Royal Estate for 24 years, has left the station. The continuing drought has compelled Mr J. Tennant to curtail expenses.

The Holiday Period has been remarkably free of over-indulgence or other activities occasioning police action.

Departures in the near future: Messrs F.J. Martin, M. May, W.P. Reed and F. Uren.

Salvation Army. Adjutant and Mrs Elder will farewell Burra people tomorrow. They are going to Unley.

A Burra contingent for Bundaleer Waterworks leaves for there during the week.

XV, 548, 14 Jan. 1903, page 2

The Boys’ Club lads have been meeting in a room in Thames St. Recently they amused themselves by destroying the toilet and threw the material all over the place. M-C Grosser collected the ‘gang’. The boys were properly scared, but were not prosecuted on condition they collect all the debris into a heap and filled in the hole. ‘Those 14 boys perspired more on Thursday than ever before.’

Cricket. The third match between North and South was played at Victoria Park on Saturday 10 January and resulted in: North 172 defeating South 151.

Salvation Army. Adjutant and Mrs Dodd took over on Thursday.

SAR. The recent rise in train fares saw only 358 passengers booked for the north on Xmas Day compared with 1,017 last year and 196 New Year’s Day compared with 1,175 last year. Does this make sense?

Main Roads are badly damaged by recent rains and we can’t see how they can be repaired without a special grant.

Burra High School. [Bleak House] Principal’s Report for 1902.

Epidemics of measles and pneumonia made attendance sadly irregular for two quarters. Dorothy Roach is Dux for 1902.

In Class IV Mollie Stafford is ahead of all others as she was the only pupil present for all four quarterly exams. In the junior class Joy Sangster has the highest exam average. Rev. W. Murphy has done excellent volunteer work. There were so many absences at the end of 1902 that it was decided to postpone prize giving till Easter 1903. The prize list is printed.

Salvation Army. Adjutant and Mrs Dodd were welcomed at the Barracks on Thursday by Sgt-Maj. C. Morgan on behalf of the local corps. Ensign Nicholls, an old soldier of the Burra Corps was also present.

Seed Wheat Fund. A call is made to aid the fund which provides seed wheat to distressed farmers. 2/6 will buy 1⁄2 bushel of wheat to sow 1 acre and with the Government subsidy will serve 2 acres.

Mt Bryan Sports will be held 11 March with 16 events, both pedestrian and cycle.

Spurious coins are in circulation.

The Burra Electro-Magnetic Works are not yet in full swing.

Clare Races were held last Wednesday. Results are printed.

A Bolt. John Ford was at the old slaughterhouse one day last week on his way to the Black Waterholes and he left his six-year-old daughter in the cart. The horse bolted and dashed along the Baldina Road, the cart swerving onto one wheel for about ten yards, but the young girl managed to bring the horse to a stop and by the time the pursuers had caught up she had succeeded, though she lost some skin from her hands in the process and all he joints were stiff from the exertion.

[This reads like the slaughterhouse at the junction of the roads east from Kooringa and Redruth, and not O’Leary’s old slaughterhouse near the cemetery.]

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. was floated some time ago under what was thought to be favourable circumstances, but since then almost nothing has been done, though a plant to treat the dumps on the surface has been erected. Difficulty in drying the stuff on the surface has resulted in considerable alterations and so delayed the start of operations. Messrs Martin & Co. of Gawler have made certain proposals. They propose to take over the mine and work it on tribute, but negotiations are not finalised.

Burra Waterworks.

For some time a breakdown of the pump has been feared. On Monday the engine failed, and though attempts were made to keep going using three of the six pumps it eventually had to be given up. The engine is not powerful enough at 6 h.p. when some 14 h.p. is needed. The cost of keeping it in repair is enormous. About 12 months ago the Council paid £150 for repairs to the boiler and engine and now another expense is incurred. The Waterworks account is already overdrawn £64 and as there is no way to increase income the rate will have to be raised. It costs the Council more to pump water than they can get for it. Repeated calls on the Government to reduce the capital account have had little effect. We pay much more for water than anyone else in the state and constant expense to keep the old boiler in repair is sufficient reason for the Government to listen to reasonable requests. It is absurd to assert that the value of the plant has not depreciated and in any event the original capital was far too high by some £2,000 to £3,000 and the rate of interest is exorbitant. The Government must get the works into a good state of repair and put the financial side on a more satisfactory basis. A few years ago there were wells in the town and a few days stoppage was not noticed, but now wells have been filled in and residents depend solely upon the supply. Residents are perplexed to find water which will have to be carted to the Hospital and Reformatory and stock must be driven some distance. Council at its meeting on Monday decided to take the engine out and send it to Adelaide for temporary repairs and get it back as soon as possible. We must get a new engine.

Messiah on Wednesday was a real treat. Mr G.E. Dane is to be commended for producing such a difficult piece under adverse conditions. The local stage was too small and additions had to be made.

Wirth Bros. Circus appears tomorrow night at the north end of town.

Weather. In the past week very hot weather led up to Saturday when at 9 p.m. a very severe thunderstorm struck with severe hail which covered the ground 2”-3” thick. Vegetation was stripped of leaves and flowers were destroyed. Grapes were reduced to pulp. Spoutings were blocked and water overflowed into ceilings. Scores of sparrows were killed. Two horses attached to vehicles carrying children bolted, but they ran into each other after 100 yards and so a more serious result was averted.

Martindale Races ran last Wednesday and attracted 5,000 to 6,000 people. Sideshows were numerous, but did relatively little business. Results are printed.

A Trip to Clare: Part 4. (Final)

‘Archie’ McLagan was well known in Burra, having entered the banking service here four years ago. Here he was secretary to several clubs and a member of the Burra Orchestra and PCR in the Foresters Lodge. He left Burra 18 months ago to fill a position in the Perth Bank. He was entrusted to take £2,000 of the Bank of Australasia’s from Pert to Kalgoorlie and went missing. He and two associates have now been charged with the theft of the money.

XV, 563, 18 Feb. 1903, page 3

Archie McLagan was brought to Burra as a child and being the only one in the family received great attention from both parents. He was a clever scholar and received a college education. He was noted for his geniality, courtesy and general good conduct. Both parents are dead and his aged aunts most shocked.

[He must have been the child of the architect Mr George McLagan and his wife was the principal of Burra High School, conducted at ‘Bleak House’. The principal of Burra High School in 1902 was one of the shocked aunts, Miss Annie B. Millar.]

[Further details of the incident are given.] [Stephen Sanderson died 19 February 1903]

Obituary. Rev. James Rowe died 14 February 1903 [Aged 78]. Notes from a sermon preached in his memory by Rev. W.F. James at Redruth Methodist Church 22 February.

J. Rowe preached his first sermon aged 18 and entered the Bible Christian ministry three years later. After five years he and Rev. James Way, father of SA’s Chief Justice, were sent to SA as the first Bible Christian ministers in Australia, arriving in 1850. Mr Way settled in Adelaide and Mr Rowe in Kooringa, where there was a church to seat 200 and three local preachers. After a month he walked most of the way to Adelaide, preaching by the way. On the return journey he almost died of an illness at Kapunda, but survived another 52 years. For some time he and his wife lived in a hut in the Burra Creek with a household of eight members. Then a friend allowed them a room in his house. The church prospered till the Victorian gold rush. Mrs Rowe supplemented their income with needlework, often 16 hours a day to provide the necessities. After the men returned a manse was built and the size of the church doubled. For a time the circuit was fifty miles long, but then Kapunda was attached to Gawler. Mr Rowe opened services at Riverton, auburn and Watervale. After six years in Burra Mr Rowe began work in Adelaide. After a struggle £1,000 was raised before the opening of the church which is now the social hall of the Central Mission. In 1859 Mr Rowe went to superintend the Mission in Victoria, where he spent 18 years. The circuit at Geelong was 140 miles long. The term at Ballarat was hard and in Melbourne he managed a book room. One day he left Melbourne by coach and travelled 60 miles before breakfast and the road being too hard for the coach, then rode 60 miles to reach his destination by 8 p.m. that day. Mr Rowe returned to SA in 1877 and for six years worked at Moonta and Auburn. He was president of the Conference in 1881 and returned to England two years later where he superintended the erection of the beautiful church at Forest Hill in London and visited widely. He returned to SA and spent a further six years in the circuit before being superannuated. Later a purse of sovereigns and an illuminated address were presented him in Franklin St Church. His strong willpower made him a formidable opponent. Mrs Rowe died two years ago.

Editorial on The Burra Mine.

Those who recently invested were assured that action would quickly be taken to get the mine producing. It is months since the bargain was closed and there has been silence. Copper prices are up and the market outlook is good. Shareholders need to bestir themselves or the ores will never be disturbed. The Snow process to treat the ‘dumps’ is not yet a success and it will be some time (if ever) before there is a dividend from that scheme. Something must be done to foster the mining industry. The town is becoming poorer every day. It is only the small capital that prevents action, but that will not grow and we might as well make the best of a bad job and develop the mine as far as possible with the money on hand. The shareholders will then be content, though perhaps not satisfied that they have got something for their money.

Court.

There was a family dispute over two lots of wandering fowls that has resulted in George and Frank Ford not talking to one another.

[A court case was reported with a lengthy explanation of an essentially trivial matter in the paper of 25 February 1903]

A second court case arising out of the incidents is reported in this issue.

The Phosphate discovery at Black Hills has turned out quite well. Test samples have shown 651⁄4% and the body of stone is quite large. A bulk sample of 31⁄2 tons has been sent to Adelaide Chemical Works for treatment.

John I. Sangster Sen. writes a letter on the Burra Burra Mine.

Some time ago when the town was pointed out as being in decline, the mining company was floated and many, wishing to show their confidence in the venture and the town, put their money into it. So far little has been done and the experiment to extract copper from the dump does not look promising. Since then more families have left the town, the brewery has closed and the status of the hospital is reduced. The Eastern Plains are again a failure and more of the surrounding country has passed into the hands of large land-owners. Unless some new industry is forthcoming the drift will continue. The closing of the Smelting Works has thrown a number out of employment. The coming winter will be hard for many. The mine is the only clear option and should be undertaken, even if little or no profit comes to shareholders. There are, according to old miners, thousands of tons of payable ore close to hand in the open cut and if the water was lowered and a reasonable tribute exacted there would be work for a number of men. Why not? Someone competent should give a reliable opinion. It seems the directors are happy to leave it to posterity.

Burra Burra Copper Co. shareholders met at the Institute on Friday. There was a large attendance requiring extra seating. E.W. Crewes presided. The chairman said that 18 months ago there was a move to float the Burra Mine, but not a lot of capital was forthcoming. It was thought that the mine would end the trouble and distress of the town. We were then given to think that the mine would be developed systematically and that work would commence soon. The meeting was not called to dictate to the directors, but to discuss the matter in a friendly manner. Complications had arisen, but were being overcome and he hoped the property would be active soon.

Dr J.I. Sangster moved the meeting request information from the directors re the prospects of the mine starting work. Shareholders had a right to know at least when it was intended to develop the property. 2nd W.E. Jordan and carried.

W.J. Davey moved that considering the present price of copper the meeting feels that valuable time is being lost. Nothing appears to have been done in 18 months. Certainly the Snow process was in course of erection and no doubt the treatment of the heaps would be shortly commenced. With copper at £64-£65 a ton the outlook was bright. 2nd T.W. Pearce and carried.

Dr J.I. Sangster moved that in view of the lack of employment and the distress in Burra and the decrease in town population it is a matter of national and local importance that steps be taken to start the mine as soon as possible. If water was pumped out of the mine work could be found for many immediately. Most had not invested to get fat profits, but to advance the town and bring back a tide of prosperity. The town was getting poorer and residents were still leaving. 2nd E.J. Cox.

W.J. Richards spoke in support as did Rev. W.G.M. Murphy. J. Drew thought the motion awkward. The directors were likely to reply that they were not philanthropists. The directors were in it to make money and not for the benefit of Burra. A report had been circulated that owing to a clause in the agreement between Messrs Snow & Elder, Smith & Co. and the Burra Burra Copper Co. no water could be pumped into the Burra Creek because the contract between the parties gave them the right to treat ores in the creek. But this difficulty could be overcome by pumping into a different part of the creek. He did not object to the motion, but thought it would carry little weight.

Rev. Murphy then thought he would withdraw his support.

Mr Burns favoured the resolution because he thought some advantage should be given to tributers.

Mr Drew moved as an amendment:

‘That local shareholders having fullest confidence in the wealth of the Burra Mine and having respect to the number of local men who are anxious to get work on it, trust that the directors will soon be able to see their way clear to start some work on the mine.’

Mr Crewes thought the directors needed to be told the unvarnished truth about distress in the town and the urgency of the need for employment. We are told directors are not philanthropists, but they do have sympathy with the needs of the town. He felt the amendment was weaker and supported the resolution.

Dr Sangster said that rather than breed discord he would withdraw his motion in favour of the amendment as he thought they said much the same thing.

The amendment was put and lost and the motion then carried unanimously.

The resolutions are to be conveyed to the directors in Adelaide by a deputation of Dr Sangster and Rev. W.G.M. Murphy.

St Patrick’s Day was celebrated yesterday with a special service at St Joseph’s. In the absence of Father Reddan due to illness it was conducted by Father O’Dowling from Sevenhills.

Obituary and Inquest. William Henry Pitcher, aged 18, was killed in a hay carting accident. He was working for Mr Thomas Rogers. The inquest was held at Hanson on Sunday.

The evidence of those at the farm was consistent and the police agreed with them.

Gold Prospecting. Messrs W.H. Hardy, E. Johnson and A. Brandt of Burra, left last November on a prospecting trip to the MacDonald Ranges in Central Australia, for a local syndicate. They returned last week after a most eventful time. After many hardships they arrived in Central Australia within four weeks of leaving Oodnadatta with two horses and a spring dray, having walked the whole 400 miles on account of insufficient horse strength over heavy tracks with long stretches between water. Mr Hardy had very favourable opinions of the Arltunga Fields, having been there some 5-6 years before and not changing his mind this time. Their early return was due to the half-hearted funding by the syndicate. The field was dominated by many well prepared parties in command of large amounts of capital. Still he fears much harm is being done by speculators and boosters, beating up the value of stocks far too high before men actually on the field have had a change to prove the real value. Much more honesty is required. Despite all, he thinks there are real prospects for genuine investment and for properties worked honestly. So far he says the White Range Field is the only proven one. There reefs are true and plentiful. What is needed is for a big company to buy out the smaller ones, provide water and introduce machinery. The Hardy party did peg out a claim which assayed 8 dwts gold and 17 oz silver per ton, which a company with a battery and water could make pay, but they had to abandon it. Hardy finds the country not bad to live in. The climate in the ranges is splendid, but provision must be made for a permanent water supply and sanitary arrangements attended to. The best way to get to Arltunga is by train to Oodnadatta (£3-1-4 from Burra) and then per mail coach for £9 plus provide your own provisions. The trip takes about 3 weeks.

Burra Burra Copper Co. Report from the Deputation to the Directors.

Mr Crewes presided at the meeting at the Institute on Thursday evening.

It has been rumoured that the manager of the Electro-Magnetic Works had instructions to call tenders for clearing out the creek leading from the open cut. Dr Sangster had waited on the manager, Mr Marriott, who confirmed that it was so.

The results of the conference with the directors were reported by Dr Sangster:

The directors will consider dewatering the mine to a certain level.

The directors are favourable to a number of tributers working in the mine.

The directors will consider reducing the royalty paid by tributers: those present being favourable.

The directors have confidence in the work of Messrs Snow & Elder.

In the event of unwatering the mine Mr Snow’s rights would not be a hindrance.

Profit arising from treatment of orey matter by the magnetic process would be used to develop the mine up to £10,000.

We are satisfied that the options being pursued are the best in the interests of shareholders generally.

The report was received.

The hard-headed business attitude he felt was absent and the directors were anxious to help as much as possible. They said they were surprised the royalty was currently 5/- in the £1 and one said he thought it was 2/6 in the £1. They were quite in earnest re the unwatering of the mine. E.W. Crewes was encouraged by the creek clearing and hoped the meeting might soon bear fruit in terms of employment.

Rev. Murphy said it was Mr Snow’s idea that had encouraged the directors to buy the mine. Mr Snow was willing to erect an electric pump to the existing structure to reduce the water level. If work proceeds in earnest a crusher will be erected to the advantage of tributers. Of course Mr Snow would be paid for treating the ore. Directors were out to foster tributers. Directors did not intend developing the mine until the tailings had been treated. Messrs Snow & Elder had a time limit to start treating the tailings by 13 July. If the mine was unwatered to 50 fathoms at least 300 could be employed.

Rev. Murphy thought it would help the tributers if they got together and formed a sort of company.

Mr Sanders didn’t think that idea would work.

[Personal note: this may be Mr John Sanders, my great-grandfather, who worked as a tributer at the mine after it closed.]

Thefts. There have been several petty robberies at Redruth and Kooringa lately.

Rain so far this week has been very useful.

Paul Neydock was charged with indecently assaulting Katherine Bennett, aged 4, on 1 April at Kooringa. The evidence strongly suggests he was intellectually disabled and Dr Sangster said he thought the accused was ‘not mentally sound’. The bench was not convinced of that and he was committed for trial in Adelaide.

Mr Hardy gives a further account of the goldfields in the MacDonnell Ranges in Central Australia. He says he would be very willing to return there if anyone wants to fund a party: he would go either as the leader or a member of the group. He says he is responding to questioners interested in the prospects of gold in the MacDonnell Ranges. Despite adverse reports about parts of the country he says he is still favourably inclined about it as a whole. At Winnecke’s what has been found has often been in disturbed country and the origins of the gold are yet to be determined. He also expressed some faith in the discovery of payable alluvial gold between Winnecke’s Depot and Ruby Gap to the east along the Hale River.

Hettie Walhert, aged 15, was charged with stealing various items of clothing and Manchester from Jane Berriman of Kooringa, between 24 March and 2 April, to the value of £5. She was sent to Redruth Reformatory for two years.

Burra Defence Rifle Club AGM was held on Wednesday 1 April at the Burra Hotel with the President, J.A. Pearce in the chair. He reported a less successful year with falling membership due to decreasing prosperity in the town and a general feeling of malaise in Australia. Still the club was well supported by several gentlemen with prizes and fired 24 local matches with an average of over 15 competitors. Five matches were fired with other clubs of which Burra won two and lost three. [Details given.] There was a credit balance of £8-18-4. After the visit to Semaphore we adopted Bisley Targets, having been told these would replace the old military ones, but few clubs have done this and good results with them have not been obtained with the Martini Rifles. The club will revert to military targets and conditions.

Shooting match for clock, cup and rifle on 8 & 12 April: G. Scott 95 from H.E. Riggs 88.

W.H. Hardy, who has represented the ratepayers as Councillor in both the East and North Wards for nearly ten years, has been approached to fill a vacancy in East Ward caused by the resignation of Mr Henry Walker who has left the district. He has had to decline as he expects to be absent from the town for some time.

Mr Wittber, who was headmaster of Burra School ten years ago, paid a visit to the town on Easter Monday and visited old friends. He looked very well despite the death of his wife about two months ago.

W.H. Linkson is visiting the town for the first time in about nine years, owing to the death of his mother. He holds a responsible position in the telegraph department in WA. He is disappointed with the reserve in Redruth which he planted with trees at great cost and which if looked after would have beautified the town. He was a tireless member of the Town Council while here. [Dec. 1891-Nov. 1895]

The Lane-Robertson & Co. Burra-Arltunga Prospecting Syndicate

W.H. Hardy writes to contradict John Lane’s version of the recent prospecting trip to the NT.

He claims Mr John Lane has publicly set forth untrue issues relating to the failure of the recent prospecting trip, but that Hardy is willing at any time to meet any shareholders and prove the bona fides of the party and he says their claims against the managing director were just and honest.

[Note that the Record does not appear to have published any of Lane’s statements, though Hardy was reported at length in the papers of 1 April & 8 April.]

‘Where are we?’ writes asserting some illegal goings-on in Council.

Some weeks ago a Waterworks Commission was held and a certain business was decided upon, but when it got to the general meeting of Council for confirmation the Council decided not to do so.

At the following meeting one of the ruling powers from his place in the chair, finding one Councillor absent, presented these minutes again, put them again and declaring them duly carried, demanded the business be transacted. Though brought forward illegally and passed as confirmed, even then the business was not adopted by the meeting as law demands. This is but one instance of the muddle things are in and it is time ratepayers met and made some attempt to get the town’s business legally transacted before it is too late.

St Mary’s Easter Vestry Meeting. The past year had been singularly happy and pleasant. Church was well attended. The income had been £419 and expenditure £425. Church buildings had been thoroughly renovated for £98. It was decided to start a ‘Rector Building Fund’ [sic] [Rectory!]

Deputation to Council re the Water Concession.

A previous meeting of Council decided to do away with the concession whereby ratepayers were allowed to use water at their private residence if they did not use it at their business premises. The deputation objected and asked for the resolution to be rescinded.

The obvious arguments were presented by Mr Crewes:

People were only asking to be allowed to use what they had already paid for – no extra water is involved.

They merely sought what was just and equitable.

The speaker thought there was a leakage somewhere, but it was not with the larger ratepayers. Drew and Crewes were a large ratepayer, but used very little at the Kooringa store – they should be allowed to use it at the Redruth [sic] store. [i.e. Aberdeen] The difficulty would persist if the Council did not put on meters.

C.C. Williams echoed Mr Crewes – he paid at four places, but used water only at two.

Mr Wilkinson followed – he favoured the use of meters.

The Mayor said he would place the matter before Council, but could not hold out any hope for the deputation. The Council had considered the matter carefully and concluded something had to be done to check the enormous leakage daily witnessed. The Council is about to approach the Commissioner of Public Works with a view to inducing him to allow the remission of six months rent due to the cost of repairing the boiler. He did not wish anyone to pay for what they did not receive. The Commissioner said that unless the concession were removed and a proper system for the delivery of water inaugurated they need not approach him in the matter. Meters would be placed at various places and if leakages could be located the cost of water would fall. If a ratepayer has two properties he would have two meters to pay for. The Council is paid for 15,000 gallons and is pumping 40,000 gallons daily.

The Mayor said their plan is the only way to find out who is using the water.

116 meters had been returned to the Government at less than one third their cost.

The Mayor was determined to have the Waterworks in credit in his term. There was a leakage of 24,000 gallons a day.

Mr Jordan said Messrs Snell, Cook, Wilkinson, Urwin & Sons, Lane and himself did not use any water at their business places. His Worship – Well, I don’t believe that.

Mr Jordan – none of them have taps on.

A certain user had recently been found by meter to have used 50,000 gallons when he thought they had used 20,000. His Worship said they wanted to act fairly to all. As soon as possible all old meters would be replaced and he guessed all would be surprised. He said the Waterworks had been constructed on the guarantee principle and not on the concession. The concession had only been available about ten years,

Mr Wilkinson – longer than that.

Cr West – 14 to 15 years.

Mallett Athletics Club4th Annual Sports was held on Saturday last in bad weather which meant a rather small attendance at Mr H.W. Collin’s paddock. Results printed.

Entertainments in Burra last week included a hirdy-girdy, [sic] the Cunard Family, a cheap-jack and the Marionettes.

Mr W. Pryor, the Waterworks engineer, is able to get about again with the aid of a crutch and stick. The injury to his leg is making progress.

W.H. Hardy writes that Mayor Sampson had talked rot about the concessions not being allowed by the Act.

Clause 109: ‘Commissioner of Waterworks has power to lease the works to Municipal Corporations etc.’

Clause 110: ‘That the Commissioner has power to allow such concessions and remissions as he shall think fit etc.’

Clause 111: ‘The lessee during the term of the lease has and may exercise all such rights powers and privileges as are vested in the Commissioner.’

Motor Bicycles. Last week W.J. Richards of the Bicycle Depot Aberdeen sold two motor bicycles: one to T.H. Pearse of ‘The Gums’ and one to P. Baynes.

Elias Wilks, Inspector for the Town Council, tried to get four ratepayers fined for wandering goats, but being unable to reliably identify the goats the cases were dismissed with £1-10-0 cost to the Council.

Rain. Good falls throughout the district.

Burra Waterworks. T.F. Bentley is currently filling the position of engineer at the Waterworks.

On Wednesday the Mayor and Dr Sangster interviewed the Commissioner of Public Works, R.W. Foster and the Hydraulic Engineer, Mr Beyer, to get some reduction in the Waterworks account. They sought a reduction of £2,000 from the capital account. This was flatly refused, as was one of £1,000. The works were inspected. They asked then for the remission of the current half-year’s rent of £162 and they are hopeful that this might be granted. Expenditure has been £200 more than the income for the past two years and at present the account holds £80. This really means the remission of four year’s rent at 4%.

[This last remark is not explained.]

Colonel Madley Commissioner of Police visited Burra on Wednesday and inspected the police stations at Redruth and Kooringa and then visited the Burra Mine, the school and other public buildings. He admired the fine trees and general appearance of the town.

W.H. Hardy writes that some of the Councillors are now saying that even the Commissioner himself cannot deal with concessions or remissions except on the surrender of the lease. If this is so then why are they wasting time seeking concessions from the Commissioner themselves?

A Bolt. Mr L. Grow was unloading empty hogsheads from the former Unicorn Brewery at the Railway Station when one of them fell against the horses’ heels. They bolted across the lines and as a train was due from Mt Bryan danger was apprehended, but Mr Grow managed to stop them and retrieve both horses and trolley before the train arrived.

The John Wesley Bi-Centenary was celebrated at Burra this week. A convention and public meeting was held at Kooringa in addition to Sunday services. The weekday part was held on Monday 15 June.

Convention – Rev. T.B. Anguin presided and Adjutant Dodd of the Salvation Army offered the opening prayer. Rev. W.F. James read a paper on Methodism; a Revival of Early Christianity.

Public Meeting – R. Snell offered the opening prayer. Mr Davey, who attended the centenary of Methodism in Cornwall 64 years ago, presided and spoke and Rev. A.H. Melbourne spoke on Methodism and the Young.

S. Burns spoke on Methodism in Burra. When Rev. D.J. Draper opened the first Wesleyan Church in Burra there was no place of worship for 70 miles. Services began at Redruth in 1851 and R. Reed, who is still alive, wheeled the mortar for the first church built there. Rev. J.G. Wright was the first Primitive Methodist preacher and James Blutchford [sic] [Blatchford] was the first Bible Christian preacher in 1848, but the church was nearly paid for before the first Bible Christian minister arrived in Rev. J. Rowe. There was a great revival under Rev. J. Way – one meeting lasted from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. Matthew Burnet did much to foster the spirit of unity among the three Methodist Churches. In Canada, Australia and New Zealand there was a move for union with the Presbyterians.

Tea was served between the Convention and the Public Meeting. After expenses the collection produced £1-1-8 for the Burra Benevolent Soc.

Kooringa Masonic Lodge installed Frank Treloar as worshipful Master last Wednesday. A sumptuous spread followed at the Kooringa Hotel.

Burra Water Commission met at Burra Institute 22 June.

The Mayor presided with Crs Cook, Snell and Sangster. Crs Lott, Lockyer & West were absent.

The Commissioner of Public Works sent a letter in which he agreed to a rebate of £81-10 owing to the extra costs due to repairs to the works. The letter was received and a cheque for £81-1-0 sent to the Commissioner as half of a half-year’s rent from 1 January to 30 June 1903.

It was resolved that applications be called for a certified engineer at £11 a month for the Burra Waterworks.

It was pointed out that a number of meters needed repair. The task of getting an extra man to help the engineer was left with the Mayor and Chairman of the Waterworks.

Dr Sangster moved that rent for the meters be charged from 1 July at 4/- p.a. for 1”, 3/6 p.a. for 3⁄4” and 3/- p.a. for 1⁄2”, payable half-yearly in advance.

The Commissioner requested Council to sign the lease of the Waterworks and return it. Cr Snell moved this be further considered.

Cr Sangster moved that as the Water Commission still has under consideration the rearrangement of the present scheme and until this is finalised the Commission is unable to give a definite reply to the deputation which waited on them re the water concessions.

It was decided to put a meter on at Messrs Elder Smith & Co. at Aberdeen.

Obituary. Mr Arkhurst, [sic] a solicitor in Burra many years ago, died in Mt Gambier last week.

Burra Electro-Magnetic Works was officially opened on Saturday after some two years preparation. Mr Snow and other interested gentlemen visited the works. An inspection was followed by a sumptuous spread at one of the old mine offices.

Burra Mine. The Burra Burra Copper Co. was asked some time ago to reduce the royalty paid by tributers from 5/- in the £1 to 2/6 in the £1. The directors promised some months ago to consider both that and the unwatering of the mine. A reply now says they are awaiting the results of the magnetic process.

Mr Snow is to put a tunnel through the large heap of ‘dumps’ to see if stories of a load of carbonate put there in the early days are true. He also said he was prepared to buy ore from tributers in the rough state, saving the trouble of cracking it into small pieces with a hammer.

Three Kangaroo Dogs savaged sheep at Mr Bagot’s recently and though four weaners and some lambs were killed, Mr Crosbie the manager was able to follow the dogs home to Kooringa and identify them and their owners. They paid £8 damages. The owner of two dogs promised to send them away and the third belonging to another person was destroyed.

John Snell celebrated his 70th birthday on Monday. He came to Burra in 1853 and began work as a miner. He joined the Bible Christian Church and was involved in it till Methodist Union, being Sunday school superintendent for 33 years. He has been a member of Burra Burra Lodge MUIOOF for 48 years and a trustee of it for 45 and been through the chairs five times. He was one of the Town Council’s first Councillors and was recently elected again to represent East Ward. He has also been connected with the British and Foreign Bible Soc. for a number of years.

Burra Electro-Magnetic Works

Work in real earnest begins now after the official opening last Saturday when Mr Gall spoke. The treatment of the ‘dumps’ is seen as the first step in the restarting of the mine. The Burra Mine had really only been opened down to 300’ and yet had produced something like £4,000,000 worth of ore. There was every reason to believe that rich deposits had not yet been touched. He regretted the slow start of the new company, but hoped the Electro-Magnetic Works would be the start of something being done with the mine.

Mr Snow said unforseen difficulties had delayed the start, but they had now been overcome. Mr Marryat, the manager, had displayed great skill in overcoming problems after the engineer from Germany failed to give the expected assistance and returned to Germany leaving them awkwardly placed. These were the first such works in the world and they will produce ore that smelters will gladly buy, but whether the concern will be payable is another question. So far it had not been profitable, but they were hopeful. Stories that in the early days large bodies of ore were buried in the dumps will be investigated by driving a tunnel through the dump. He was inclined to think most stories of mine riches were of the ‘fairy’ description. He said the company would buy ore from tributers as raised without its being cracked – and pay full value for it – cracking can take up to 2⁄3 of their time.

Mr Young followed this speech with some encouraging remarks.

The Mayor responded. He was sure there was plenty of ore to be found. He had arrived in Burra in 1847 and was the oldest resident; he had been in Burra during the strike and thought that Bunt’s shaft would be a good place to start and that Beck’s would also be profitable.

Mr Gall thanked the Mayor.

The main problem was raising capital in SA.

The official party left by the 3.30 p.m. train.

W.H. Hardy writes querying whether the Mayor can legally pay a Council employee a bonus without Council approval and whether he can allow business decided upon at a special meeting to be carried out before it is approved by the Council in a general meeting.

‘Fairplay’ writes re football. He questions the results of the Manoora game last Wednesday. Burra undoubtedly got 3.2 (20). Manoora got 3.10 (28), but then the field umpire cancelled the last goal making Manoora’s total 2.11 (23). The second goal went between the posts but was certainly touched by two Burra men, but the field umpire would not agree even after Manoora said it was not a fair goal. So the ‘real’ result should be Manoora 1.12 (18) to Burra 3.2 (20). The field umpire was impartial, but made severe errors and should know much more about the game.

Chess & Draughts Club attracted only three players to the last meeting.

Municipal Election, for North Ward.

W.H. Hardy 26

Mark Linkson 14

Mr Roach was declared elected and he thanked those present.

Mr Hardy congratulated Mr Roach and said he had come out because the Mayor was riding a high horse, bluffing his Councillors and doing work unauthorised by Council. He accused the Mayor of shutting up the minute book and declaring meetings closed without legitimate reason. He claimed the citizens’ list for the election was not properly prepared. He claimed Mr S. Harvey had been improperly prevented from voting and he quotes the Municipal Act of 1890 to support his contention.

The Mayor responded by saying that Hardy had great impudence in trying to dictate to him how the election should be carried out. He did his duties to the best advantage of town and ratepayers. No election had been held under fairer circumstances. He would not listen to the remarks of the biggest ‘gas bag’ in the town – he questioned very much if the would be Councillor was a citizen and said he didn’t ‘come here to have a conversation with a fellow like you.’

Reminiscences of Captain Killicoat.

Arrived at Pt Wakefield 18 July 1853 in the barque Malacca from Montevideo after a passage of 70 days with a cargo of 180 mules imported by the Patent Copper Co. Other passengers were E.K. Horn, Mrs Isaac Killicoat and family and Mrs Skews and family. These mules were used to carry low-grade surplus ore from Burra to Pt Wakefield – two bags or c. 2 cwt per mule. This was then shipped to Swansea. Mr Horn as agent went to Rio de Janeiro in the Malacca to buy the mules and then the barque went on to London for the Killicoat and Skews families and brought back a cargo of scrap iron. On reaching Rio the Capt. found that the mules had been bought in Montevideo and went there and got them aboard, taking six weeks to return in rough weather. The Mexicans in charge had much trouble on the voyage to Australia due to very rough weather and several mules died. Mr Horn acted as Company agent in Pt Wakefield till the railway to Kapunda opened and traffic was then diverted there. Mules were then used in wagons in lieu of driving in mobs with packs of ore by the Mexicans. Other loads of mules followed and several loads of scrap iron, but while the Malacca was away it was found that Carculta ironstone near Black Springs would act as a flux for Burra malachite, so the load of scrap iron was used to build a wharf at Pt Wakefield and no more imported. Mules were better than horses and had the longest and hardest stages (between Mule Camp and Burra) other stages to Kapunda via White Park which were shorter and easier were done by horses. The Company had a variety of teams using horses, bullocks, mules and donkeys and did much of their own carting while others were employed in various ways. At the works store you could buy almost anything and there was a butcher’s establishment to supply employees with meat at a time when many lived in the Burra Creek – some with large rooms, nicely whitewashed, cool in summer, warm in winter with fireplaces and shelves cut out of the ground. The Patent Copper Co. had 18 reverberatory and three refining furnaces at work. They constructed the roads and bridges between Burra and Pt Wakefield and Baldina and were lessees of Baldina Run then. They also owned land between Burra and Pt Wakefield and for example grew hay etc. at Kadlunga to feed their stock. The Mule Camp and White Park belonged to them. The Company still carry on smelting at Newcastle and have wharfs etc. at Pt Adelaide and Pt Augusta and one of the best copper mines, the Clara St Dora near one of our great northern railway stations – smelting the ore at Newcastle.

[Note: other sources say Chileans rather than Mexicans. White Park was on section 271 & 172 Hundred of Waterloo c. 2km north of Tothill Creek.]

Rev. Wilfred G.M. Murphy writes protesting the letters condemning him in the last issue. He says Miss Niemann admits to having been helped to write her letter and expressed regret for the trouble it caused. Since ‘Commonsense’ could not have been the only other person present how could they write on the matter? [The letter does not however, quite deny the substance of the original complaint, though it tries to cast it in a somewhat better light. Murphy’s description of Miss Niemann as a servant at Mr Thomas’s comes across as somewhat patronising.]

Salvation Army. Captain Aberg, who was stationed at Burra about three years ago, is back for a visit to recover his health which has not been good lately. He is currently stationed at Renmark.

A Bolt. Last week a wheel came off Dr Sangster’s trap and the horse then bolted throwing Dr Sangster and his sister-in-law, Miss Turnbull, from the vehicle.

Mr Jeffrey of The Lagoon had an accident last week on the way from his home to Schomburgk, when he was apparently thrown out and stunned. The horse was taken out of the trap, the harness placed in the vehicle and Mr Jeffrey turned up on Wednesday at Mr Kiekebusche’s, having wandered around dazed all night. The horse found its own way home. Mr Jeffrey (c. 65) sustained a severe gash to his jaw, a damaged wrist and thumb and also bruises. Mr Rooke brought him in to the Hospital.

[In two places the wrist is said to be dislocated and in one place it is broken. The Hd of Schomburgk was renamed Hd of Maude in 1918. The mystery of the release of the horse and the placement of the harness is solved in the next issue.]

Theft. Tramps broke into a hut of Mr James Reed on Loch Winnoch Station [About 50 miles east of Burra] near Braemar last week and robbed him of flour and rations. They killed a sheep, cooked it and buried the skin etc. They left the pots and pans dirty. The sheep was valued at 11/- to 12/-.

A Juvenile Bazaar last year, organised by eight girls raised £6 for the Hospital funds. They were Nellie and Rita Vivian, Dorothy and Renie Crewes, Nellie and Nita Pearce, Millie Pascoe and Ivy Ward. They decided to buy a ‘Spinal Carriage’ for the Hospital which cost £8-14-0. On 25 July they, together with Eileen Johnson and Nellie Moody, had a second bazaar which this time raised £16-7-6. The money for the carriage left £14-3-6 to go towards the fund for lighting the Hospital with acetylene.

Rev. S. Cuthbert will preach at Redruth Methodist Church next Sunday and lecture there Monday on Our Wonderful Century.

Hanson Methodist Church. £140 has been raised and tenders are called for its construction.

H. Niemann writes asserting that the letter printed in her name was in fact her own writing and represented both her sentiments and the truth. What she regretted was seeing the Rev. gentleman in such a perturbed state of mind.

On the same theme someone sent in a poem:

‘Wilfred knew a little lamb

Whose face was white as snow

But everywhere that Wilfred went

That lamb she wouldn’t go.’

The editor says there were seven other verses, but this one will suffice.

Burra Town Council, 3 August.

Mr E.C. Sedgman was appointed Waterworks Engineer after much debate. He has worked at the Bundaleer Waterworks for five years. He can take down and put up engines, inspect and repair pumps and boilers, lay pipes etc. He will overhaul the plant in preparation for summer pumping.

M-C Aiston, now stationed in Kooringa, was a member of the 1st Contingent from SA for the Boer War. On Friday he received a silver clasp of five bars bearing the names of Belfast, Diamond Hill, Johannesburg, Orange Free State and Cape Colony, to go on his Service Medal awarded when the Duke of York was in Adelaide in June 1902. Having served its time the 1st Contingent was disbanded on 29 November 1900 and M-C Aiston joined the Permanent Artillery.

Unemployment. At present there are more people out of work than for many years past. Last week a group waited on Mr W.H. Hardy to take their case to the authorities. He has prepared a petition to the Premier asking for some work to be provided in the district which over 50 able-bodied men have signed. Mr L. O’Loghlin MP and Hon. W.B. Rounsevell presented the petition to the Hon. Commissioner of Public Works (Mr Foster), with a request that if it were possible to start any work in the district it be done promptly.

Maria Fairchild writes denying that she was ‘Common-sense’ in the correspondence re Rev. Murphy and denying his assertion that she could not write. She was present, but had no intention of writing to a paper about it, but now says she was well pleased with the way Miss Niemann conducted herself on the occasion and agreed with the sentiments expressed by ‘Common-sense’.

Opal Mine. Mr Williams thinks he has found opal just outside the boundary of Millerton towards Firewood Creek. Several claims have been staked by Messrs Williams, Halls & Richards. It is expected the reef extends to White Cliffs.

St Joseph’s will hold a mission conducted by Rev. Father O’Dowling SJ from 30 August to 6 September. He is presently taking fortnightly services in Burra. He has the oversight of Mintaro.

Juvenile Crime Wave. Two lads, Snowy Williams and Skinty Morrison, recently stole a fowl from Mr Thomas Sandland on Limestone Hill, along with a nest of eggs. They entered the house of Mrs Williams in her absence, cleaned, boiled and ate the fowl, followed by the eggs. They then entered a room let to Mr S. Burns and stole 4/- and a pair of sleeve links. They spent the money on toffee and beer after which they rounded up horses in the Brewery Paddock and hacked off their hair, which they sold at 1/- for a pound of it. Mr Martin’s cab horse and other animals also suffered. They were sent to Magill Reformatory till 18.

Mr Jeffrey’s Accident. The mystery of how his harness got into the trap after the recent accident was solved when it was revealed that Mr Crewes found the horse and trap with the animal cold and starving. He took the horse out and fed it and it then went off home. He put the harness in the trap.

A Wattle Blossom Fair will be staged on 4 September to aid the Redruth Methodist Church.

W.H. Hardy has received news of a splendid gold find at Algebuckina Goldfields c. 30 miles south of Oodnadatta and he is seeking those who would form a small syndicate of c. £15 to £20 to meet the cost of placing him on the ground for 2-3 months work at what he is confident will be a payable thing.

W.H. Hardy waited upon the Hon. L. O’Loghlin and Mr William Miller at the Burra Railway Station on Monday in reference to the petition presented last week to the Premier, the Hon. J.C. Jenkins. They said a reply from the Commissioner of Public Works is expected this week. They believe the Aberdeen Ballast Quarry may be opened again shortly and other work found outside the town. Men with two horse drays could find work at Ucolta at present.

Numerous other claims are idle.

J.H. Dawes of Princess Royal has unearthed some fine copper ore in the past week – a drive into the hill of some 30’ struck a well-defined reef – several tons will be treated shortly.

Young offenders Williams and Morrison were released from Magill Reformatory last week and then taken back again. Something is wrong!

The boys were delivered to Superintendent Mr Gray, but after several days he decided that a mistake had been made in the mandates forwarded and that the justices had made an error. The parents were advised to come and take charge of the boys. Mrs Bennett could not afford the trip and Morrison could ill afford it, but he went down and brought the boys back. The police and justices expressed surprise and asked for an explanation. Before this could be given Mr Gray arrived and had the boys re-arrested and took them back Friday afternoon. He paid Morrison for the expenses incurred. The boys were understandably much cut up by this series of events. It seems a shoddy way of doing business and a cruel way to treat the lads. An enquiry is called for.

P. Leahy, who was in charge of the boring plant at the Burra Mine recently, has been appointed to supervise boring for coal at Townsville in Queensland.

Burra Waterworks.

Mr Sedgman has presented a report that shows that many of the complaints made by Council were valid, though many were not. Had they been in possession of the facts they would have known how deplorable the condition of the machinery was and would have had less trouble in finding out about the supposed leakages. It is impossible for the engineer to have been pumping anything like the quantity he claimed. When he said he pumped thousands of gallons, he hardly pumped as many hundreds. Three pumps out of six were not working. Five out of six were without springs and yet it had been reported that all were working smoothly. This shows the importance of appointing a competent man. Not only has the new engineer reported the problems, but has demonstrated them before the Councillors. The great cry was that the reservoir was emptied night after night: in fact the water never went into it. No wonder the engineer had to work night and day. With only two pumps working and steam at high pressure and leaking away through loose joints etc. The repairs will see enormous savings in wood and pumping times can be halved. The engineer will have time to see to the flushing of the mains and other neglected aspects.

Report on the Cornish Boiler:

Joint and steam wheel valve on the dome blowing.

Joint on feed pipe blowing.

Blow-off cock in bad order, leakage at bottom under fire door.

Engine:

Plummer rod brass worn and knocking.

Cylinder back joint blowing.

Joint on feed pumps in bad order.

Engine requires packing.

Joints on governors blowing.

Joint on steam pipe blowing.

Flywheel out of plum and therefore bad rock caused.

Pumps:

Three pumps drawing air and glands in bad order.

Only one pump has a spring in the bucket.

Three of four springs are broken.

Pump rods loose, block in bad order.

Some rods bent and badly coupled with too much play etc.

Some repairs have already been effected. [Those are listed.]

Dr Ramsay Smith, the Adelaide Coroner, has been suspended amid horrific stories of his exhuming corpses and removing heads and limbs. It is reported that some 20-30 bodies have been interfered with.

The Governor, Sir George Le Hunte, passed through Burra on his way from a visit to Oodnadatta. Being unannounced only two or three were on the station platform to greet him. Rev. W.F. James was introduced to His Excellency.

Burra Waterworks repairs have been vigorously pursued to ensure an adequate waters supply for the summer.

Rain fell on Sunday and a good flow down the Burra Creek suggested heavy falls to the north. Except for two brief periods the creek has flowed continuously this winter: something unknown for seven of eight years.

James W. Jones of the Commissioner of Public Works Dept. writes to indicate that ballast will not be required this year from the Aberdeen Ballast Quarry.

Phosphate Mine. Messrs Baker, Killicoat and Rosewall have secured three search licences each of 640 acres in the Hd of Bright for phosphate. Two are to the south and one to the north of Field’s workings and evidence of that deposit has been traced. Samples sent were assayed at 591⁄4% tricalcic phosphate in stones very different from those at Field’s.

Shooting Accident. On Saturday Frank Shortridge and Alfred Hunt, aged 19, son of A.J. Hunt, went shooting rabbits. On the way home Hunt was about five yards in front when Shortridge changed hands carrying the rabbits and in the process a rabbit’s foot discharged his Winchester. The bullet entered Hunt’s side just above the hip and passed through. They were faced with a three mile walk home, but at Ford’s old slaughterhouse on the Baldina Road they were picked up by Mr Truscott. The lad is making favourable progress after a miraculous escape.

Bread has risen from 31⁄2d to 4d a loaf.

Salvation Army. The Biorama Co. arrived in Burra on Saturday and set up in the Salvation Army Barracks. The Band was organised to assist. Pictures on Sunday included Lazarus Raised, The Widow’s Son, The Woman at the Well, Perpetua: An Early Martyr and Jessica’s First Prayer – all were deeply impressive.

On Monday the Band played stirring music in Kooringa, Redruth and Aberdeen before more pictures were shown. The proceeds were highly satisfactory.

Cadet Robert Prowse, who was born in Burra and whose father had charge of the local corps was a member of the Biorama Co. visiting Burra.

A Bolt. On Monday evening Master Keith Roach was thrown from a trap when the horse bolted. The horse had tripped and fallen, breaking the shafts, before dashing off down Kingston St from Mr Joraslafsky’s into Bridge Tce where the trap ran into a post and was smashed up. Keith was only bruised.

The Primitive Methodist Wattle Blossom Bazaar was held in the Institute Friday and Saturday last.

Hanson Methodist Church. The builders have begun and memorial stones will be laid on 14 October.

W.H. Hardy writes querying the way the Council has discussed the Waterworks issues arising from the report of the new engineer, in committee, so that the public are kept in the dark.

‘A Ratepayer’ of north Ward writes condemning the Mayor for taking the whole Waterworks matter into his own hands.

‘The Mayor, in his wisdom, put a person to carry on the works, and what is the result? According to the engineer’s report in the Record the works were allowed to go to rack and ruin. In your last report it looks like star chamber business, and the Council is afraid to let the ratepayers know what is being done.’

G.A. Ridgway writes re the Burra Burra Copper Co. and the continuing inaction of the directors. All they seem to have done is hold their half-yearly meeting, and protect their fees. Having slept a good while they will wake up at the end of this month to ‘draw another half-year’s screw’. When are they going to spend the £5,000 they have in the bank? When is the Snow Co. going to start operations? Everything was going to be in full swing by 13 July.

Obituary. The Kalgoorlie Miner of 14 September reports the funeral of the late George Sara, aged 64, who died the previous Wednesday. Deceased was born in Perranwell, Cornwall and came to SA in 1848 when 21 years old. About 8 or 9 years later he went to Kooringa carrying out many contracts as part of the firm of Sara & Dunstan. Afterwards he went to Broken Hill and then to WA where for about two years he did a great deal in the building trade. He came to Kalgoorlie about 7 years ago and since has put up many large buildings in and around Kalgoorlie. Deceased had three brothers. Thomas is in residence in Kalgoorlie and the other two are well-known identities in Pt Pirie and Broken Hill respectively. His father Mr George Sara is still alive at Willunga, aged 90. By his first wife he leaves five sons and three daughters. By the second wife, who survives him, he leaves four young children.

The Water Commission has reported, but it is unfavourable to both the Wandillah and Burra Creek schemes. Something must soon be done, for the present well supplying the town will surely be drained if the Mine Pool be pumped out.

Letter to Editor from ‘Ratepayer’ asking:

Question: Editor’s reply:

Did the Council a month ago vote Mr Prior [Pryor] £10;

said to be in lieu of one month’s notice? Yes

Was this amount ever put on the pay sheet? No

Has Mr Prior ever received the money? No

Can the Council legally withhold it? No

Who is guilty of refusing to hand over the money and carry out

the Council business? We cannot say.

‘Ratepayer’ writes re the same topic and says that when Mr Pryor applied to the Town Clerk he was referred to the Mayor (Mr Sampson) and that gentleman refused to pay. Where are the Councillors? Why do they allow the Mayor to run matters contrary to the wishes of the whole Council?

For over two hours the tea tables in the council chamber were crowded.

Historic sketch by Rev. W.F. James.

Services at Hanson began nearly 25 years ago in the house of the late Mr Rogers and were continued in the Council Chamber. In 1880 Hanson, Farrell’s Flat, Stony Gap and Black Springs comprised a Home Mission. After 9 years of struggle even a liberal Home Mission grant couldn’t support the Mission and in March 1888 Farrell’s Flat was joined to the Mintaro Circuit and Hanson and Stony Gap to the Burra Circuit. When that divided they became part of the Redruth Circuit. An organ was purchased two years ago. Some 15 years ago Mr J. Lane gave £20 to the Wesley Jubilee Fund towards new churches at World’s End and Hanson. The former got built, but the latter was not realised even with a three year extension and the £10 went to other uses. Three years ago fund raising started for the present effort. It was begun with £20 from Jesse Humphrys. Two acres of land at the corner of South and West Terraces were obtained and since then £150 has been raised towards the building.

Over £40 was laid on the stones at the ceremonies including a donation from the Federal Speaker, Sir Frederick Holder. The tea and collections raised £10. This means there is £200 raised of the estimated £250 needed to open the church free of debt.

[Considerable more detail of the people involved in the history of this church is given in the article.]

W.H. Hardy writes re Mr Pryor’s £10 expressing his view that the Mayor should write his personal cheque for £250 payable to the Council for his errors in connection with the Waterworks – and then he should retire.

Wesley Bicentenary Church at Hanson. Trustees were glad to learn the memorial stone day had yielded £55. Rev. W.F. James has been invited to preach the first service on 20 December and Rev. T.B. Anguin the second. Mr Jesse Humphrys will donate £5 more if farmers in the area will give bags of wheat and seven bags are already promised.

Fire & Inquest. On Saturday evening about 8.30 fire was reported at the premises known as Sara & Dunstan’s and now occupied by Otto Bartholomaeus, carpenter and builder. The origin is a mystery not clarified at the inquest which was held on Tuesday at the Bon Accord Hotel. About 400 people soon gathered and there were plenty of hands to assist in fire fighting, but the building of wood and iron containing timber produced flames of such height that the rays were seen at Farrell’s Flat and Mt Bryan. Swagmen raised the alarm. The quantity of timber kept the fire going for several hours. The verdict was that it was started by person or persons unknown with no indication of whether it was accidental or otherwise. Building and contents insurance was £350 and £150 respectively and the estimated loss £800-£900.

Since the general meeting in April the Electro-Magnetic Separation Co. has made several trial runs with its separating plant and has sent over 100 tons of concentrate away to Wallaroo. The trials have satisfied them that the plant needs certain crushing appliances available only from the USA and pending their arrival work has been suspended. The directors of the Burra Burra Copper Co. are considering the unwatering of the mine’s open cut to allow more ore bearing ground to be worked. Presently there are 8 tribute pitches let and the Magnetic Co. has the right of search over a block to the northwest of the open cut and they are employing seven men sinking and driving.

Burra Creek Flood.

The sudden flood in the Burra Creek on Sunday evening attracted young boys to the water. Several got into the bed to race the water and foolishly stopped at intervals to see how close they could let the water get to them. This went on till the old ford at Roach’s Flour Mill was negotiated where the three boys – one called Fuss and the other two Stewart – found themselves stranded on some old stonework forming part of the ford, with water all round them. Fortunately young Harvey arrived and at the risk of his own life rescued the young Fuss who was being carried down the stream some distance and must else have perished amidst the slush and debris. Harvey got Fuss back to the island. The boys removed their shoes, but by then they were too scared to attempt to wade ashore. The police were sent for, but Harry Austin arrived with a horse and with difficulty got close to the boys and one at a time took them to the bank. Fred. Heinrich and W.J. Richards helped at this stage and the latter fell in while helping and cut and bruised his leg. Young Fuss was beyond recognition due to the mud on his face and clothes.

[‘Young Fuss’ offers several possibilities and might describe Hilary, son of Charles Fuss, but three or four of August Fuss’s sons would be other possibilities.]

Obituary. Mrs Kathleen Nevin, aged 65, died suddenly at Hanson. Her husband had worked in the railways and finished up last week. They were packing to move to Copperhouse and she may have over exerted herself. [Catherine Nevin died 3 November aged 70 according to the registration. Marriage records suggest she was born Catherine Seery, but the ages at marriage and death do not correspond.]

Obituary. Jacob Burrows has died in Broken Hill, aged 65. He had lived there for 15 or 16 years and was well known as a lay preacher in the Methodist Church. As a young man he was known as a wrestler and was for many years well known in Burra as a leading light in the Primitive Methodist Church and Sunday school.

Mayor's Report for the year.

During the year Crs Walker and Lockyer resigned and were replaced by Mr J. Snell and Mr Henry Roach.

The year began in debit £24-10-10 and the present credit is £84, of which a considerable amount will be expended by year’s end. The amount available for public works was £289-12-6 and the allocation to wards was: North £75, East £86-10-0, West £79-10-0.

In the year 200 new trees were planted to fill gaps and of these several were lost due to vandalism.

The cemetery has been maintained and 37 burials took place.

The Main Road Grant was again cut from £306 to £273.

Burra Waterworks.

A printed report stated these were in 1st class order at the start of the year and so I did not visit till early January when I found them in a filthy condition. The engine was knocking and steam was wasted. Mr Pryor claimed that everything was alright except for a little knocking of the crosshead pin. I found that only three of the pumps were working and the engine was in a state of collapse. After a report to the Waterworks Commission it was decided to get Mr Henderson to see what he could do with the engine. He patched it up in 16 hours work. On 5 February the engine completely broke down. It was decided to take the cylinder out and send the piston, rod and cylinder to Adelaide – the cylinder to be rebored.

It returned on 17 February and was refixed by an engineer from town. In the meantime the dayman and Mr Pryor overhauled the whole of the pumps and on 19 February pumping restarted. Mr Pryor was then unable to follow his employment and Mr Bentley was engaged temporarily while applications for a qualified engineer were called. After considerable delay Mr E.C. Sedgman was appointed from many applicants and he proved himself thoroughly acquainted with the management of the plant. The Cornish boiler has given much trouble due to unskilled treatment of earlier engineers and in the near future a new boiler will be needed. Early in the year it was decided concessions would have to be cancelled due to enormous leakage. A thorough inspection was made of all services and meters and showed that not more than one in ten meters was registering. Since then about 100 meters have been cleaned and replaced. All doubtful meters are now being replaced and eventually I am sure we will be able to lower the water rate. After interviewing the Commissioner and Hydraulic Engineer the former promised a rebate of £81 if we signed a lease for two years from 1 January 1904, though we can surrender the works at six months notice. The expensive repairs have now reduced running costs considerably below last year’s.

[Figures are then given for expenditure which show that repairs cost £51-2-3, Wood £60-11-3, the Engineer £112-7-6 plus a £10 gift for Mr Pryor.]

Mr Hardy asked, that considering the heavy accusations made against Mr Pryor, had the Council received the Mayor’s report – Yes it had.

Mr Hardy then followed with several other questions including querying the extension of concessions to the Electro-Magnetic Co. He also asked if the £10 to Mr Pryor was in lieu of a month’s notice.

The mayor said that was a mare’s nest. Some three years ago Mr Pryor was temporarily appointed, but never confirmed by Council. An accident to his leg some years ago appears to have now made him physically incapable of carrying on work and he was laid aside. He has not asked to be reinstated and is not yet declared off the funds of the lodge. In March a motion was carried that he be asked to resign and with the letter a promise of a gift of £10 was made. The Council then sought the services of a capable engineer.

Mr Hardy – Didn’t the Council offer him £5 to resign?

Mayor: No.

[Mr Hardy then pursued questions on who cleaned and fixed the meters and why and who authorised it and how much it cost.]

Mr Crewes asked how many Councillors read the Waterworks lease before signing it.

Cr Cook did not recall seeing it or signing it.

Cr Lott read it.

Cr Roach & Cr Snell neither saw it nor signed it.

Mr Winnall asked if it was signed by a resolution of Council. – Yes.

Mr Crewes asked if the Commissioner had made signing it a condition of the £81 rebate. – Yes.

In reply to an inaudible question from T. Davis the Mayor denied there had been any ‘back door business’ done this year – there had been no ‘shinanikin’.

Mr Crewes objected to the Mayor’s emphasis on ‘this year’.

Mr Hardy thought there had been a lot of ‘shinnanikin’ in Council this year.

Mr Hardy asked if since Mr Sedgman’s appointment wasn’t young Harvey doing the work Mr Sedgman was appointed to do.

The mayor said Mr Sedgman had been busy repairing the machinery ever since he had been there and Harvey was doing as much for 3/- a day as Hardy would for 10/-.

Hardy – if the engineer signed the agreement to do the work he should do it.

Mayor – The likes of Mr Hardy would blight the prospects of Council ever getting a good man to do the job and it was nonsense for him to find fault with such a practical engineer as Mr Sedgman. Ratepayers should put their foot down and stop such nonsensical talk.

The chair here intervened to stop personal remarks and to return to conducting business in a gentlemanly way.

Mr Hardy apologised to the meeting, but not to the Mayor. He then launched into another tirade against the Mayor over the Waterworks in an attempt to prevent the meeting from adopting the report. The report was adopted.

Cr Sangster said he was glad to be retiring. He had voted for an end to Waterworks concessions and to appoint Mr Sedgman. The Waterworks lease was too stringent and he was not present when it was signed and was surprised it had been. Also a Council was foolish not to have appointed a joint inspector of meat with the District Council. The town was poorly lighted and he hoped the new Council would give this attention.

Cr Cook gave a brief speech of retirement.

Cr Lott said he was going to offer his services for East Ward again. He had voted to sign the Waterworks lease because the Mayor had said they were compelled to do so. It would not have been done but for financial necessity. He had voted against the water concessions to the Burra Copper Co.

The Mayor said Mr Pryor had not been offered £5 to resign, but the speaker knew differently. He had moved that Mr Pryor be given £10 in lieu of notice – which was his entitlement. It was through an accident at the Waterworks that he had been incapacitated.

The Mayor: No.

Mr Neville moved a hearty vote of thanks to the retiring Councillors. Mr Hardy 2nd.

A Voice: ‘That includes the Mayor, too, I suppose.’

Mr Hardy: ‘If it does I’ll withdraw.’ (Laughter)

Mr Neville: ‘I included the Mayor, of course.’

Mr Winnall seconded the motion.

The Mayor thanked all for thanking him. He had devoted as much time to his duties as any man could. He had lived longer than any other resident in the town and now intended to retire into private life, but would always keep a watchful eye over future Council proceedings.

Mr Winnall said he was a candidate for Mayor, but felt it was not going to be a very enviable position. He would be the first Burra boy to fill the position. The Waterworks would be the greatest trouble in the year. He was willing to let the Government take over at once if necessary. It was too much to expect that they would pay more for their water under the Government that they do now. People in Adelaide paid 6d per 1,000 gallons while here it was much more. They paid 31⁄2% interest and we pay 5-6%. The Burra Waterworks were worth about £3,000 and yet we pay interest on £8,000. If they are not handed back to the Government we must insist on a substantial reduction in the capital account. When some time ago the Government valuer placed a price on the works the Government would not part with them for that value. The slaughterhouse question would also occupy much time of the incoming Council.

Cr Lott, as a candidate for East Ward supported Mr Winnall re the Waterworks.

J. Drew, candidate for West Ward, had previously refused to have anything to do with municipal matters, but as his firm was about the largest ratepayer in the town he felt it was his duty. He felt if the Waterworks account could not be reduced they should be returned to the Government. He was Burra born and so was his mother before him, so he felt he had some claim in the town.

Mr Neville, candidate for North Ward, thought the Waterworks were a sick baby and the sooner they got rid of it the better.

The Day Affair.

On Monday we received a letter saying an almost destitute girl was induced to leave home to work for Mrs Day for 2/- a week and clothes. She went to the house in Kingston St near Henderson’s Bridge and began her duties. After a day or two she was sent away after a row. The husband then arranged for her to return. Kerosene was put on her head and her hair cut off and later she left.

We then interviewed the girl, Emmie Smith.

She confirmed going to the Days for 2/- a week and found in clothes. She was to do the household duties while Mrs Day went out visiting – also the lion’s share of the washing. While she was there her hair was cut off by Mary [Day] and kerosene put on her head. She was told it would make her hair grow strong and nice. When she left on Saturday she was told to leave the clothes behind for the next girl. ‘All my underclothing was taken from me, and I am no better off now than when I went there; in fact I am worse off; I have lost my hair; and have been made an “object for people to look at”.’

We have seen the jagged hair and it is certainly a poor job. Enquiries are being made into the case to see what can be done in the matter. The girl should have the clothes returned to her, which to keep from her is against decency and humanity.

[This and the article in the following issue resulted in the Days suing the publisher for libel: see Burra Record: 614, 24 Feb. 1904, pages 2-3.]

Editorial on Christmas

The pastoral and agricultural sectors are prosperous, but the town has no industry to fall back on and hopes of seeing the old mine re-started have entirely vanished. The town has wealth it cannot touch due to the ‘conditions not at all complimentary to those responsible for the state of affairs’. Yet we hope too for commercial prosperity.

There are also the usual Christmas greetings.

Betsy & Peggy Gossiping

The column carries on the attack on the Days with respect to the cutting of a girl’s hair and has particularly unpleasant reference to Mrs Day.

‘Peggy: Lor. I thought it was Japanese or something like that – me no savvy suchee big talkee. My father and mother died when I was young, and that accounts for my bad training and uncontrollable temper. I used to listen to everybody’s business, but my own, until I got quite deaf, an now I fancy everybody is talking about me.

Betsy: Maybe you are not mistaken, Peggy.

Peggy (Pulling up the end of her large white apron and looking two ways at once): It’s hard to think so, but I have spent days and nights looking and asking for sympathy, and I haven’t got as much as will fill this ‘ricee’ bag; they larfe at me and say –

Husha-by; Peggy, don’t you cry

You’ll be a sorter angel by-and bye.

Betsy: Why, Peggy, you are getting quite poetical, well –

I must leave you in despair

But don’t cut off any more hair

For if you do you’ll surely freeze

Just like you have in this cold breeze.

P.S. Peggy: I understand that there’s going to be a hair cutting and clothes snatching contest at Victoria Park on Boxing Day, but I believe a com-a-tea will call in the police and stop it.’

Mrs Ainsley from the Adelaide School of Mines addressed the break-up of the local dressmaking class on 22 December. Afternoon tea was served and a social took place in St Mary’s Schoolroom in the evening. Addresses were given by several gentlemen. Sir F.W. Holder, the Wertheim Sewing Machine Co. and Messrs Urwin & Sons offered prizes for the best scholarship, but as entries were too few they were held over till next half term.

May & Truscott assaulted J.D. Kelly at the Court House Hotel on Christmas morning and will appear in court this afternoon.

Rain fell steadily on Monday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. It is many years since such a fall in December.

Obituary. Mrs Johanna Camp, wife of Mr Fred Camp of Hampton died at the Burra Hospital on 23 December, aged 65. She was a Burra resident of over 40 years and leaves a husband and one son. [She appears from marriage registration to have been born Johanna Moloney and to have been previously married to a Mr O’Dea, but neither he nor any of her children seem to appear in the records.]

A Mystery. On Monday afternoon Mr Frank Ford reported to M-C Phelan that his children had found a man’s hat and coat under the main bridge at Diprose’s about two miles east of Burra. The police also found a bundle of torn up letters. The letters appear to be to Albert Burgess from a Sophy Watson and were most affectionate. There were also a number of destroyed photographs of various people. A crucifix and Australian Catholic prayer book were also found on the ledge that carries the bridge. The creeks and waterholes have been searched, but neither the man nor a body have been found. The items appear to have been placed there about Sunday last. Mr Rowe, head drover of Mutooroo Station, believes A.B. Burgess is a drover engaged on Buckalow Station and will make enquiries on his way home.

Burra United Friendly Societies Annual Sports were held at Victoria Park on Boxing Day. It was hot and muggy. The procession did not occur due to the absence of society members. The attendance was poor, but competition began at 11 a.m. The pedestrian events went off well. The bicycle track was in a bad state however, riders had to abandon the track in places and there were no less than eleven falls in the bicycle races: some of them serious. The bicycle events are reported in some detail.

After the walking race Francis Joraslafsky, aged 3 got the idea of doing the same thing and took to the track. The spectators were so amused they started throwing pennies at him which he readily responded to by collecting them. He went once around the track in good heel and toe style.

The gate takings were only £27-4-9, compared with £43-7-6 in 1902.

The Burra Band attended and rendered selections of music.

In the evening the Gawler Dramatic Club produced Forgery at the Institute, to a good house.

Further details of the assault on J.D. Kelly, the well-known athlete.

The victim was assaulted by O. May, son of Matthew May, and by E. Truscott, brother of Walter T. Truscott. Kelly was first attacked by Truscott and May followed up using a bottle on Kelly’s head. An old man intervened, but was ‘laid out’. Mrs Caseretto then appeared, but was threatened if she did not leave. Mr Caseretto tried to break it up, but could not do so till he drew his revolver which undoubtedly saved Kelly’s life. The police and Dr Sangster were sent for. The victim was badly cut and bruised and had a face so badly swollen as to be unrecognisable. The two assailants took Kelly’s hat and coat and purse with £6. The coat was eventually recovered from the yard of the Mine Stores. May and Truscott tried to borrow money to make up the amount to square matters with Kelly. They were arrested in the afternoon of the 25 December and charged with assault and robbery and the case will be dealt with today. Truscott has only been here a few weeks, but May is known locally personally and by repute.

Characteristics of the paper for 1903

Page 1

An unchanged mixture of large advertisements both local and other.

Page 2

Smaller advertisements, sales advice and public notices.

News is mixed with news-like advertising in long wordy articles. Serial here or page 3.

Page 3

Two or more columns of large advertisements: not local.

News continues to be mixed with the wordy advertising and sometimes the smaller advertisements and sales notices more usually associated with page 2.

Page 4

Larger advertisements both local and patent cures etc.

In general the paper carried a patchy coverage of local news and there is a lot of padding with humour, items presumed to be of general interest and gossip from Adelaide and elsewhere.

Numbering of issues in 1903

Volume XV continued for the whole year, having started 7 December 1892.

The year began with Volume XV Number 547 on 7 January 1903

Court.

There is a long account of the case of William Edgar Truscott and Oliver May who were charged with common assault and larceny. [See paper of 30 Dec. 1903, page 2.] The proceedings, which started on 30 December at 3 p.m. and went till 10.30 p.m. and then continued on 31 December from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., are reported in c. 41⁄2 columns. Kelly lost over £6, but to allow the matter to be dealt with locally under the Minor Offences Act, they were charged with the larceny of £3-11-3. The two were apparently drunk at the time and the evidence was all about the larceny as the assault was admitted. Truscott, a butcher living in Kooringa and working for his brother, gave an account of playing dice with Kelly that had led to the fight. May corroborated his evidence. The account of the money trail is intricate, but in the end the Bench found the prisoners guilty and fined them each £5 or 6 months and on the assault charge they were fined £4-4-0 in all.

XV, 607, 6 Jan. 1904, page 3

‘Roasted’ writes suggesting the UFS Sports Day be changed to three months earlier or later to avoid the heat and the farmers’ busiest time of the year.

Rev. Father O’Dowling has been in charge of St Joseph’s for six months due to Father Reddan’s ill health. He was also in charge of Redhill which made for a very large workload. He now departs, but has made many friends here who will ensure a hearty welcome at any time.

F.A.S. Field of Monavea has just reaped a paddock of 60 acres which averaged 331⁄2 bushels to the acre. The ground had been dressed with two cwt of phosphate to the acre and the grain was plump and of excellent quality. It was reaped with a Massey-Harris harvester.

Wesley Bicentenary Church, Hanson.

Half the land now held by the trustees was obtained 30 years ago. For 25 years services were held in the Council Chamber. Mr Jesse Humphrys set the ball rolling four years ago with a donation of £20. For two years the only addition was 24/- interest. Then the Sunday school gave £1 and a tea meeting raised £3. In 1902 the whole of the site now used was acquired for less than £11. It was decided not to let tenders till two thirds of the estimated cost was raised, and to aim to open the church debt free. A dinner, lectures and supper in October 1902 paid for the land, but by the end of the year still less than £50 had been raised. Mr J. Pearce prepared the plans and specifications for free after the dimensions and style were agreed in January 1903. The Hon. J.J. Duncan made Cross Roads Quarry available and 100 yards of stone was raised and carted the four miles free – equal to a donation of £25. In June, finding no other church in Australia was to mark the Bicentenary of John Wesley’s birth, it was decided to call the building the Wesley Bicentenary Church. Tenders were called in August and Mr J. Humphrys invited to lay the first of two memorial stones. Though wet weather kept many away the ceremonies produced over £56. Mr Humphrys had by now given £42 and offered £5 more if others would donate wheat – 7 bags were immediately offered and 16 subsequently. Nearly £200 of the £250 needed had by then been raised. A call was made to Methodists across Australia for a crown donation (5/-) to honour the Wesley Bicentenary and eventually 125 crowns were received. [£30-5-0]

The church comfortably seats 100 and is substantially built. The masons were Messrs T. & C. Tiver, the carpenter Mr J. Pearce and the clerk of works was Mr P.B. James. It was crowded on 20 December for the first services by Rev. W.F. James and Rev. T.B. Angwin. One old lady in the congregation was born on the day of the Battle of Waterloo. Tea and a public meeting on Christmas Day 1903 saw over 100 visitors from Burra and quite 300 altogether. Messrs Bentley and Pearce took photographs. The tea meeting raised £13. Only the seats which cost £20 remain to be paid for. This account was settled and with a £10 promise there was a balance of £20 towards a porch, fence, and other necessities which will cost £40.

Inquest into the Brewery Paddock Fire of Sunday 31 January: held at Kooringa Hotel.

Cuthbert James saw the fire start about midday about 200 yards from the road as he came in from Baldina. There was no one about. He reported it to Mr Killicoat and then the police.

W.J. Richards, when told, mounted his motor [i.e. a motor cycle] and went to the fire. He got a couple of bags from Ford’s house to attack the fire.

George Lockyer & E.F. Lockyer both had an interest in the paddock, but neither could help explain the fire. H. Lockyer corroborated the two previous witnesses.

P.L. Killicoat believed the substance found near the source of the fire was phosphorised pollard.

R. Hunt agreed.

Verdict: The fire was started by phosphorised pollard wilfully and maliciously placed by person or persons unknown.

‘Disgusted’ writes that as a resident of Aberdeen he/she is surprised that certain people are allowed to use such ‘beastly and filthy language once or twice every week, and at all hours of the night’.

Luke Day & Mrs Hester Day sued W.J. Davey, proprietor of the Burra Record for publishing a libel on 16 & 23 December 1903, referring to the cutting of a girl’s hair and putting kerosene on her head. The court was full. The report occupies about 3 columns. The defendant’s lawyer did his best to give the impression that Luke Day behaved improperly towards the girl Emmie Smith. Hester Day gave evidence that Emmie’s hair was dirty and there were sores on her head. The girl agreed to have her hair cut and ointment was applied to the sores composed of kerosene and eucalyptus oil, in order to kill the knits [sic].

Mary Day also gave evidence corroborative of the above account. [She says incidentally that she had lived with the Days for about 9 years.]

Emmie Smith’s evidence was that she went there willingly. She said she did not tell Mr Davey she had done all the housework or the lion’s share of the washing. She did not say her hair was jagged off. She did not at first agree to having her hair cut, but later agreed. Mr Day had never acted improperly. She left because she got another job at Snowtown. She had not said she was worse off than before she went there.

David Smith, the girl’s father confirmed the above.

When Emmie arrived from Snowtown for the trial she was met by Mrs Day and she and her father had then gone to Mr Winnall’s office (Day’s lawyer) and then had had a meal and discussion at the Days’ home.

The defence tried to show this was when the above story was concocted – it being at such variance with the story in the paper.

Davey said he had interviewed the girl Emmie with her sister and he took notes at the time. He produced the notes he said he took at the time and said Mr Smith had agreed then that the information should be published. Davey had told Smith he thought the latter had been taken advantage of because he was in Day’s debt. The article, he said, was written without malice and in good faith.

In the end the Bench found for the plaintiff and fined the defendant £15.

Burra Hospital’s Gas Lighting.

Details occupy 1⁄2 column. The installation was by C.C. Williams and his foreman Mr Patrick Dower. There is a generator carrying 36 lights. Almost all the building is now lit, but a few more lights will be needed when finance permits. R.M. Harvey presided at the opening. Dr Sangster spoke, particularly of the advantage the lights would be in the operating theatre. He particularly thanked the eight young girls whose bazaar had raised some of the money needed. (Nellie & Rita Vivian, Nellie Pearce, Ivy Ward, Irene Crewes, Neta Pearce, Milly Pascoe & Eileen Johnson.) The hospital had played a vital role now for 27 years. Revs. W.G.M. Murphy & W.F. James & Mr Winnall also spoke. There were musical items and refreshments.

Swimming. About two weeks ago a shooting party went to Princess Royal and the day was hot enough for some swimming. [A comment in column 6 suggests in Komatipoort Creek.] Walter Truscott and George Herbert both got cramp and Thomas Broad entered the water to aid them, though he cannot swim. Only the aid of others present saved him in turn. Afterwards a committee was formed to present Mr Broad with an illuminated address in recognition of his brave attempt. This was presented on Wednesday when the party visited Princess Royal. Mr E.F. Lockyer gave an eloquent address.

St Mary’s. The rector and wardens of the church have been concerned for some time about vandalism of church property. The most recent act was the removal of three bridle posts around the church and a reward of £2 has been posted for information leading to a conviction.

Burra Show Soc. published a report on 26 February that showed last year’s income was £318-3-10 and expenditure was £314-18-9, but some of the expenses were for permanent assets so the real profit was c. £35. The society has about £40 to its credit and a Government grant yet to come in.

The Season has started well with excellent rains and green grass everywhere, even out east where feed has been a novelty for the past seven years. The rain last week was so heavy in some places that the railway north of Burra was washed away and several trains were late getting to Burra. Locally falls were steady and soaking and were absorbed into the ground.

Rabbits are of course on the increase in response to the new grass.

F. Field & Co. are pushing on vigorously with the phosphate mine at World’s End. Machinery is being erected at Dry Creek and when it is ready rock will be sent away in large volumes.

Burra Mine. For the past 8 weeks men have been sinking a shaft near Peacock’s Air Shaft and have struck blue carbonate and cuprite ore at 60’. Green and blue carbonate was struck near the surface and followed down and a crosscut begun with promising results. The shaft will be continued to water level and another drive done at a suitable place. This will give an idea of the lode which seems to be extensive. The shaft is in virgin ground and the lode seems to be extending with depth. Mr Pryor, the underground manager is cautiously hopeful. Four men are working at Bunts’s Shaft at a depth of 100’ and though results are not as good they are sufficient to encourage continuation. Two men at Tinline’s are also continuing. Water will be a major concern if large scale work is contemplated.

Obituary. H.E. Bright, a former MP for the district, died last week.

Foresters Lodge. The paper makes reference to problems at the Court Unity Lodge, but is coy about the nature of the problems. [Was there a connection after all with the disappearance of T.T. Shortridge?]

Burra Mine. The rich lode at 65’ in the new shaft near Peacock’s air Shaft is causing much interest and many visitors. Though not as rich as the material last week the lode is still payable stuff and it is being bagged to be sent for assay. At Bunts’s the miners struck malachite and the shaft is also opening out well.

Obituary. John O’Reilly, working as a rabbiter on Mr Murray Scott’s station about 40 miles east of Burra, was found dead in the bed in his tent on Thursday last, 3 March. He had been quite well on the 2 March. M-C Phelan was sent for and arrived at 4 a.m. the following morning. The deceased seems to have died quietly in his sleep.

Burra Waterworks.

A deputation from the Town Council waited on the Commissioner of Public Works. Originally the works were estimated to cost £3,600, but this crept up to £8,000 before they were completed. The Corporation has leased the works for upwards of 15 years and water consumers here have had to pay nearly twice the amount of the general rate for the whole town and yet the cost of repairs means that even now the half –year’s rent cannot be met. The deputation seeks the writing down of the capital account from £8,000 to £4,000 and the replacement of the present engine and pumps with modern equipment and that a new and larger reservoir be constructed with an additional main from the pumping station without increasing the capital account. If neither of these is done the Corporation seeks to buy the system at valuation. Mr Foster, the Commissioner, said that Burra was a town and not a country water district and towns in districts similar to Burra paid nearer to 10% than 2% which was about twice what Burra paid. The Commissioner was willing to send the revenue accountant up to have the matter investigated, but he knew what the result would be – the Corporation would want to continue it themselves. He would not sell at valuation.

M-C Phelan later went to Fred’s House and said that Mrs Holden of the Reformatory would like to congratulate the new Mrs Camp and he took her to the Reformatory in his carriage. Once there the bride was immediately charged with deserting the institution and was detained. Mrs Camp, nee Francis Carbis said she was 22, while Fred is 70. Authorities say she is only 20 and another version says she is 19. Under the Act she can be detained till she is 21 for breeches of discipline while at the Reformatory.

Obituary & Inquest. Kenneth Allen Gebhardt, second son of the late Frederick Gebhardt Sen. baker of Kooringa, died suddenly at the residence of his brother W.A. Gebhardt of Kooringa.

[Kenneth Allen Gebhardt, born 13 February 1867 and died 27 March 1904, was the son of Ferdinand Gebhardt. William Alfred Gebhardt was his brother.]

He took ill on Sunday morning and died later the same day. He had lived all his life in Burra and was aged 34. For many years he had suffered from gout and other troubles. Dr Sangster refused to issue a death certificate, having seen the deceased very little.

W.A. Gebhardt:

Deceased had been with me for three years. Saw him Sunday midday when he seemed all right. He said about 2.30 that his left arm had gone ‘dead’. Rubbed his arm with liniment and gave him a drink. Lit his pipe for him about 4.30 and about 4.40 he became unconscious. Sent for my brother and later for the doctor. There were several bottles in the room, but he did not have a drink after 2 o’clock. Don’t know when he last drank wine. Had lately suffered from pains in the head. On Friday was struck in the eye by a piece of wood while chopping wood.

Dr Sangster Sen. said he was called at 6 p.m. and found the deceased unconscious and paralysed in the left arm and leg, with a wound on the left cheek below the eye. Visited again at c. 8.45 p.m. when deceased was sinking and died soon after. The wound could have been caused by a piece of wood, but the symptoms suggested a haemorrhage of the brain.

Frederick Gebhardt reported going home with the deceased on Saturday night and having a glass of wine from a half gallon flagon of the deceased. Afterwards felt bad and blamed the wine. He believed his brother had got the wine at Johnson’s. Saw deceased on Sunday morning when he was vomiting. He got up at midday and appeared very ill, but on seeing him at 2.30 when I went to mix dough he appeared all right. Was sent for at 5.45 and when I arrived ‘Kenny’ was in a dying state.

Mrs C.M. Johnson of the Kooringa Hotel gave evidence of supplying 21⁄2 bottled of Hardy’s dark and £ bottle of Yalumba light wine.

Eileen Johnson, daughter of Mrs C.M. Johnson, said the wine had not been supplied to the deceased, but to Mr F. Gebhardt, but when the latter vehemently denied this she said on being questioned again that she could not be sure which Mr Gebhardt it was, as they looked so alike.

John Henderson gave evidence of the wood-chopping accident.

The jury returned after consideration and asked for a post mortem and analysis of the wine.

On Tuesday the resumption of the inquest heard Dr Sangster report that death was due to brain haemorrhage unconnected with the blow from the wood. It was probably hastened by over use of alcohol. The deceased’s heart was enlarged and kidneys were diseased as well as the bowel. There was no indication the wine was impure, but straining during vomiting might have hastened the rupture of a blood vessel in the brain.

The verdict was death due to brain haemorrhage accelerated by excessive drinking of wine.

E.W. Crewes writes to correct a mistake that appeared in the Advertiser 19 March in which he is reported as saying that Mueller stayed until his funds ran out and then borrowed £1 to clear out.

Redruth Reformatory.

Two girls escaped from the reformatory about ten days ago and were returned on Saturday evening by M-C Phelan. They spent the first night eastward and then started for Thistlebeds and then on to Robertstown with a lift from an Assyrian.

They were Agnes Dyke and Martha Learmouth. The constable covered about 250 miles in his pursuit.

## The Fate of the Smith Children

As a footnote to the episode concerning Emmie Smith which resulted in W.J. Davey being sued for libel: only a couple of months later Mr Smith went to Snowtown to work leaving the girls behind. Jane (18) was in charge of Emmie (15), Sarah (10), Ruby (7) and Violet (4), but she was unable to adequately fulfil her duties and the State Children’s Department intervened with the result that those under 18 were sent to the Industrial School, Edwardstown, until they reached that age. The attitude of the paper is clear from the closing comment in the report: ‘they will be better off under the care of proper guardians than under the care of any almond-eyed individual’.

Ratepayers’ Meeting re Burra Waterworks.

There was a meeting at the Institute on Monday evening chaired by the Mayor, Mr J. Winnall.

The Commissioner of Public works reported that the revenue accountant Mr J. Bee had been to Burra, inspected the Waterworks, and interviewed members of the Corporation. The Commissioner has now considered his report. The question now asked of the corporation by the Commissioner is whether the water quality in the well is sufficiently satisfactory to justify the continuance of the supply from that source and would justify the needful, but costly improvement in the pumping plant. The conditions on which the Government can assist in improving the plant while the Council owns the lease are:

An up-to-date plant will be provided and fixed by the Government if the Council agrees to pay in addition to the interest now being paid, interest at 4% p.a. on the proportion of the outlay fairly chargeable to the capital account.

The Council will agree to pay to the Government the proportion of cost which would be fairly charged to maintenance.

It is understood that Mr Bee has disabused your mind of the impression that the works which were originally estimated to have cost £3,800 have actually cost over £8,000.

If the Council wishes to have the Government resume control at once the proposal is:

Present lease to be cancelled at once or at an early date to be determined by the Council.

The Government to assume control and management.

The Government to provide new and efficient pumping machinery and if found necessary an additional storage tank.

The government to rate the district on a scale not exceeding what is known as the ‘original scale’ and which is now in force at Gawler, Pt Pirie and Pt Augusta, the Peninsular Towns and other town water districts.

Scale: at or less than an assessed annual value of £8 £1 p.a.

£8-£40 121⁄2% p.a.

£40-£100 5% p.a.

Vacant land to be charged on assessed annual value 5%

Charges for water up to the amount of rebate for rates 2/- per 1,000 gallons

Excess water to be charged at 1/6 per 1,000 gallons.

The Mayor said at the start of the year the account was £86 in credit and up to present over £100 was in hand, but the half-yearly rent due last February had not been paid. Mr Bee’s report was that the boilers were unsafe. [This was corrected in XV, 624, 4 May page 2 to say that the boilers had been condemned by Mr Dazel, Government boiler tester.] The boiler now in use was passed for three months use at 60 lb pressure which would work only three pumps which would not keep the supply up. Quality of water was not good. A chance to get better water should be taken. A new plant was needed and a great alteration for the better was needed. Six 3⁄4” taps could run off as much water as could be pumped and the tank was too small. It was impossible for the engineer, Mr Sedgman, to maintain supply under such circumstances. If the works were handed over to the Government we would get a better supply, a larger tank, a better plant and be free of all risk. If problems arose later, the Government would have to pay the cost while it would not cost the Corporation or the ratepayers one penny. F the Corporation kept the works the minimum rate would have to rise from 17/6 to 25/- and a sinking fund would have to be established. It had been said that the Government control would see payments rise, but the Government proposal would see the town get water cheaper.

Cr Roach favoured giving up the Waterworks.

Cr Drew thought the sooner they were rid of the Waterworks the better. The question had been a difficult one for years, but he thought at last they had a solution. The offer was fair and should be accepted.

Cr Snell had been opposed to the Waterworks from their inception. The mains had doubled from 4 to 8 miles and the same small boiler was expected to cope. The sooner they were given up the better.

Mr J. Sampson moved and Mr West 2nd: ‘That we impress upon the Government that the water now being used in Burra is unfit for domestic purposes.’ Carried.

The same moved and seconded: ‘That the Council be requested to hand over the Waterworks to the Government as suggested by the Commissioner.’ Carried.

The Burra Mine is still working with the drive at water level having met the lode which was found at the 40’ level.

At the Barracks they entered and began a fine performance which is reported upon item by item. On Friday afternoon the band played on several occasions in Market Square in aid of the Burra Hospital and raised over £6. They left for Riverton by the afternoon train.

The Steele-Payne Bell-Ringers will appear at the Institute on 4 May and should draw a large audience.

He was charged with riding from Mt Bryan to Burra without a ticket and riding under a carriage contrary to SAR regulations. He was fined £1 on each offence or 1 month in gaol.

Kennedy later said he had travelled extensively in the USA this way and a fortnight earlier had travelled from Stawell in Victoria to Murray Bridge, travelling all the night and then travelled into Adelaide under another train. He had travelled to Hallett from Burra under a wagon on a railway truck and then not liking the look of the country had travelled back as far as Burra under the brake-van.

Burra Waterworks.

One day last week the boiler cracked. Mr Sedgman managed the situation successfully and a fitter Mr Johns came up from Adelaide and made repairs. Yesterday afternoon a trial run showed that the patch held. Another leak is evident and Mr Sedgman will have to manage it carefully to make it hold out till the Government takes over at the end of the month.

Business Directory. The useful business directory began with this issue on column 1 of page 1.

[Other improvements to the paper are also promised on page 3. The editorial in the next issue had more to say on this. Essentially the changes introduced more local news, more snippets of information on local personalities both present and past and a greater attention to detail. There was also an increase in items of general interest, home and farming hints as well as humour. The length of the notes for the rest of the year is some indicator of the scope of this change.]

Editorial on The Phosphate Fields

Sometime ago valuable discoveries of rock phosphate were made at the east of Burra, some 17 miles away. Work was carried on vigorously at great expense and the area was explored to reveal a deposit that can now be traced for five miles. The rock averages 50-60%. The claim is known as ‘Field’s’ after F.A.S. Field, one of the promoters. Many other claims have now been taken up in the area between 15 & 17 miles from Burra. The problem is the cartage costs. These are 8/- to 9/- for the road haulage and then 9/- per ton for the rail. This leaves only about 9/- to pay for wages etc. The erection of machinery on site has not yet been deemed economical. We believe that if the rail cost could be halved thousands of tons could be economically moved. It is out of reason for the railways to charge 9/- per ton from Burra to Adelaide when they charge 11/- from places double the distance.

The Ballast Quarries are not presently in use, but as large quantities will shortly be required wouldn’t it be an idea to approach the authorities with a view to getting ballast ready to be used.

Scarlatina has broken out in the town. It is a notifiable disease.

The Old Smelts

For many years the slagheap went untouched. Then 10 years ago Mr Paynter erected a small plant to treat the slag to extract copper, but the primitive machinery was not equal to the task and after only a short trial it was taken down and removed. Several attempts with hammer and pan followed, but without providing any financial rewards. Four to five years ago Messrs Martin & Co. of Gawler undertook a much larger scale operation. The task proved more difficult than envisaged and many alterations to the machinery had to be made by Mr Mat. May, but eventually the whole heap was treated and in the process about £90 a month was paid to employees. We understand that the company was amply rewarded, though the fluctuating price of copper was responsible for lower returns that hoped for. Having now no further use the whole plant will be levelled and the materials sold by auction. The machinery itself will be sent to Gawler.

Obituary. Mrs Doyle was buried at Hallett on Sunday. She kept a store there and leaves five daughters: Mrs Jones, Mrs Simmons (Hallett), Mrs Johnson (Broken Hill) & two daughters at home. There are two sons: James and John. She was aged 65. [Eliza Doyle died 10 June aged 68.]

Obituary. Mrs [Charles] McDonald was buried at Hallett on Sunday. She had been bedridden and ailing for 14 years. She leaves two daughters and two sons: Mrs D. Seigert, Miss McDonald & Messrs J. & E. McDonald. She was 72. [Margaret McDonald died 10 June 1904 at Cartapo aged 72.]

Burra Poultry Club will meet in the Lodge Room at the Institute on the second Tuesday in the month. Annual subscription is 2/6.

Redruth Court, 8 June

James Knevitt was charged with disturbing the peace at the Burra Hotel on 29 May.

C.C. Heinrich, licensee, gave evidence that Knevitt knew he was barred from the hotel on that day (a Sunday), but entered the back way about 10 a.m. He left when told to but returned later at 9 p.m. the same day. He refused to leave and argued with Heinrich who picked up a length of hose. Heinrich prepared to fight him and Hall & Bewley tried to make him desist. Heinrich said he only pretended to have a revolver in his back pocket. When he sent for the police Knevitt left. He denied hitting the defendant or using profane language.

Thomas Hall[s] Jun. said he had gone to the hotel to see if anyone there was going out on the morning train, but he claimed not to have heard the conversation between Heinrich & Knevitt. (Or not clearly anyway.)

Knevitt gave evidence that he had been served before on a Sunday night, but denied the used of abusive language and said he had walked out when asked to leave.

Stanley Bewley also failed to either see much or hear much of what had occurred.

The Bench was clearly unsatisfied with the evidence of the two witnesses and imposed a fine of 5/- plus costs.

William Williams of Clare and formerly a miner in Burra visited the town on Thursday. He was also associated with the erection of several houses in the town in early days. He has been in bad health lately.

Mr & Mrs Thomas Vivian left Burra on Saturday 4 June at 8.30 a.m. and drove to Broken Hill via the ‘Peg Line’. They arrived on Wednesday at 10.30, using the one pair of horses.

T.P. Halls is the oldest cabdriver in Burra. He started in the business about 17 years ago with Mr D. Morrison and subsequently drove for Mr S. Hall and later for Mr Charles Schutz. Later still he and Fred Bromley bought the business from his previous master Mr Hall (no relation). Then when Fred went to work in Broken Hill T.P. continued the business. He is now 34 years old, but big enough to be much older and had the strongest voice on the line. [He was actually 39.] He was born in Thames St in the old house next to F.J. Carey’s, but it has now fallen into ruin, the wall only remaining.

[An item in the paper of 29 June says he has contacted the paper to say he was 40 not 34.]

James Tiver JP of Aberdeen was 75 on Saturday 11 June. He comes from Bristol and migrated to Adelaide in 1855 where he followed the trade of mason and builder. He came to Burra and continued this trade, building the original part of the Institute and the Jubilee Hall among other public buildings. Some 40 years ago he started sheep farming. He has been a staunch Methodist for many years and is a trustee of the Redruth Church and superintendent of the Sunday school.

Editorial on the Burra Record.

The editor has been pleasantly surprised at the response to last week’s announcement that they were making a series of changes to improve the paper and boost circulation in the face of a period when trade was at a low ebb. The cost of the Record would be cut to 1d [from 2d] with the aim of increasing sales and doubling circulation.

Advt. Bagot, Shakes & Lewis will sell on Friday 24 June at the Burra Slag Extraction Co.’s Works all the materials used in the construction of the works. Several hundred sheets of galvanised iron.

The Burra Syndicate with a mine c. 21⁄2 miles east of Silverton has a shaft down 150ft. Rich ore has been discovered and larger machinery is now required.

Ulooloo. The destitute poor officer Mr R.L. Gibbs went to Ulooloo to investigate reports that there were people there drawing rations while not entitled to them. He found instead eight persons unable to get sufficient clothes to keep warm in winter and a severe lack of blankets. Unable to help officially, he was able through the generosity of a kind member of the Board to supply some blankets. Rations are delivered once a month.

Redruth Correspondent:

The report that two ‘Best’ lamps are to be placed in the north end of town was greeted with enthusiasm.

Mt Bryan Literary Soc. held its 1st Anniversary Social last Saturday.

Burra Mine

Developmental work continues under Mr J.S. Pryor. Work is concentrated at Gall’s & Peacock’s air shafts. Good ore is being won from a winze at Gall’s sunk on the western lode 10 or 12ft from the old workings (green & blue carbonates of copper). At 115ft level on the western lode a drive has been extended 70ft through ground with indications of the proximity of a rich sulphide body. A crosscut has been extended from Gall’s shaft into old workings and the main drive secured to Peacock’s sir shaft. A large body of milling ore is exposed for over 80ft along the drive. Crosscuts show the lode to be fully 20ft wide. The drive from Peacock’s air shaft northwest shows blue and green carbonates, cuprite and rich malachite ore. A crosscut from the open cut near Penny’s shaft easterly to intersect Tinline’s lode entered the lode at 110ft. A drive has been extended along the course of lode for 180ft south and 120ft north and small deposits of rich ore have been encountered.

The mine looks exceedingly well and the company are contemplating putting in a concentrating plant to treat ore and hopes are good for further development and capital input.

Aaron Lewis is a name well known in Burra. About nine years ago he took action against a Salvation Army Captain and a member of the corps, charging them with slander. His charge was not substantiated and the evidence adduced at the trial led to his expulsion from the Army’s ranks.

[See Burra Record XV, 242, 3 May. 1893, page 3.]

Some time later he charged a woman with detaining his clothes box. Evidence showed he ‘boarded’ there, but did not pay for his maintenance. When this verdict went against him he was practically driven from Burra and went to Pt Adelaide, though he visited the town on some subsequent occasions.

At Adelaide Criminal sittings last week Lewis, a West Indian, was charged with criminally assaulting Amy Elizabeth Maxwell aged 14. Some shocking evidence was tendered and Lewis was sentenced to 15 years hard labour and 50 lashes.

Burra Town Council

Mr W. West manager of the Burra Mine wrote stating that the Directors of the mine had presented three blocks of land for burial purposes and asked the Council to take the necessary steps to get the land conveyed by deed of transfer. [Since the Burra Mine had been sold by SAMA the ‘directors’ mentioned would seem to be SAMA’s directors rather than the Burra Mine Directors.]

The Town Clerk is to write to the Commissioner of Railways calling attention to the dangerous crossing near the railway station and the need to place a lamp at the nearby railway gate to the station.

A shooting party of 32 men and youths recently shot 480 rabbits on sections 28, 29 & 38 in the Hundred of Apoinga.

To the east of Burra there is one party of nine men trapping between 3,000 and 4,000 rabbits a week. They are packed in crates and sent to the Adelaide freezing works where they realise from 6d a pair for well-grown animals. They are making from £35 to £45 a week between them.

Aborigines. ‘Jacky Ross and his lubra’ arrived in town on Saturday. Jenny makes and sells baskets and sings songs and dances for 1d. (Although she weighs about 15 stone.) But she Jacky ‘get em bad, go along a doctor’. They can tell some interesting stories of the South-East.

Burra Waterworks. A notice in the Government Gazette says the works will be handed over to the Government from 1 July. They have been under the control of the Burra Town Council since April 1889.

Unclaimed Letters. Among other people there are letters for Nihal Singh and Nottah Singh.

Burra History. Thomas Parks says when he came to Burra in 1850 the mine was in full swing and hundreds were employed. Scores of bullock teams were carting ore to Adelaide. It was common to see bullocks yoked to wagons lying down all over Market Square while owners waited for loading or prepared for the journey. The hills were scrubby and were cleared for private as well as mine use. On one occasion it became dark at 3 p.m. and lamps had to be lit. [Presumably from dust, though the article doesn’t say why.] A large number of blackfellows were camped about the place where O’Leary’s butcher shop now stands.

He kept a grocery business in the shop now occupied by W.E. Jordan and did well enough to retire comfortably. There were no children.

Ted Wall of Booborowie recently returned from Broken Hill where he says he met Billy Baker who was ostler at the Pig & Whistle Hotel in the early days.

Thomas Pascoe of Clare visited Burra recently to see his sister Mrs John Harris. He came to Burra in 1849 and worked at the mine before going to the Victorian goldfields where he was fairly successful, returning to take up land at White Hut near Clare. He is 74 and in good health.

Mrs J. Howell, who appeared in court last week, has lived in the district for many years. She is very feeble now and suffers from a heart complaint. When asked what she was doing now she replied: ‘I am dying’. [Since she survived till 18 November 1925 one might question how good an actor she was on this occasion.]

Mr J.P. Stow, our Stipendiary Magistrate, retires on 30 June 1904. He presided at the Redruth Court for the last time on 20 June. He arrived in SA in October 1837 and was educated by Mr David Wylie of Magill. He became a farmer before going to the Victorian goldfields and returned to resume farming. After about four years he became an auctioneer at Gawler and later at Adelaide. About six years later he joined an expedition to the Northern Territory in the course of which, in the boat Forlorn Hope, he was with a party that followed the northern coast of WA for 2,000 to 3,000 miles. In 1865 he joined the staff of the Advertiser and worked there for 20 years, the last five or six as editor. In 1884 he was appointed as Stipendiary Magistrate of Naracoorte on the death of H.J. Smith SM. When J.B. Scott SM at Mt Gambier died the two positions were merged and Mr Stow moved to Mt Gambier, but after some time he found the climate did not suit him and he applied for and was transferred to this district where he has served 14 years. He is 74. He has published a book: History of South Australia, its Productions and Natural Resources. [There is a copy of this in the Burra Community Library profusely illustrated with black and white etchings.]

Editorial on SA Politics.

A comment on the present state of SA politics in which the editor believed the Government to be weak and ineffective and was failing to implement its policies. He felt that the emergence of the Federal Government had set back state politics for years. [Presumably by siphoning off able men like Holder.] He also thought that payment of MPs had been a bad move.

The Black Bridge in Kingston St is having its central pillars undermined by flood waters and if steps are not soon taken it will be endangered.

Burra School students gave a concert on Friday prior to breaking for the mid-winter holidays.

[The first song had the very politically incorrect title: I will buy you a little black nigger’.]

Weather. A light fall of snow was witnessed in Burra last Thursday, but it melted on touching the ground. The fall at World’s End was much heavier and reduced visibility to less then a chain.

Mt Razorback near Mt Bryan was partially covered.

In the last week 115 points of rain were recorded in Kooringa and this converts what looked like being a poor season into one with some promise.

Burra Waterworks were taken over by the Government on 1 July. A search is being made for a better source of water and the Hydraulic Engineer (C.A. Bayer) has visited the Black Waterholes and Wandillah sites [where the possibility of a dam was considered].

Rabbits. After last week’s report a number of unemployed men have turned to rabbit trapping. Mr C.C. Williams has introduced a rabbit trap that will hold as many as a dozen rabbits.

Mushrooms are plentiful as a result of the rain and one at Princess Royal was 12” across and weighed 11⁄2lb, though its colour discouraged its discoverer from eating it.

Robert E. Lawson, an agent, has been arrested and charged with the larceny of 4cwt of soap from Saddleworth valued at £4-16-0 and 5cwt from Burra valued at £6.

Redruth Correspondent reports that the ‘Best’ lamps are only a qualified success. The one on ‘the corner’ was going well on Sunday, but the one on the bridge had gone out by 7.30 p.m.

The New Lamps. A new arc lamp and three ‘Best’ lamps have arrived. The arc light has been placed on the corner of Henderson’s blacksmith’s shop and the ‘Best’ lamps are in front of the Institute, on the bridge near Hon. J. Lewis’s, at Neville’s corner and on the Black Bridge. [Which unaccountably makes four!] All of them are giving trouble, but Mr J. Harvey the lamplighter expects they will yet give a good light.

Burra DC Elections. The only contest was for auditor and J.A. Pearce defeated W.H. Hardy.

Jacky & Jenny Ross, the two Aborigines who lately came to the town, left yesterday for Clare where their home is. Jacky was taken ill while here and a subscription list was started on Monday to assist the old couple.

Miss Simpson of Burra Public School has been transferred to Grote St School in Adelaide.

Mrs Mary Ann Vivian is the oldest lady in Burra at 93. She arrived in Burra from Plymouth in 1855 with her husband the late John Vivian who lived to 80. Mrs Vivian brought with her a daughter (Mrs S. Pearce of Leighton) and two sons, the late ‘Sampy’ Vivian and Harry Vivian. John Vivian worked as a miner at the Burra Mine until an accident to his leg, after which he was employed making pick handles and the like. For 16 years he was rent collector for SAMA till his death.

Thomas Parks came to SA in 1846 and worked for four years in Adelaide before coming to Burra with his wife and two children. He married before he was 20. Here he worked for Messrs Roach & Roscow as a baker for some time at a bakehouse close to O’Leary’s butcher shop in Queen St. He then went to the Victorian goldfields, but was forced by ill health to return after only eight or nine weeks. He then became a baker at the rear of John Snell’s premises and afterwards ran a grocery business for 38 years in the shop now occupied by Alf Bennett, working up a nice little business. He raised five daughters and three sons: Mrs Dyer (Orroroo), Mrs Ware (Adelaide), Mrs T. Goldsworthy (Adelaide), Mrs A. Bennett (Burra), Mrs R.D. Pascoe (Burra), Thomas (Burra), George (Pt Pirie) & Charles (Burra). He has built four nice cottages in Chapel St and bought another in Bridge St as competence for himself. He is now living with his son-in-law Alf Bennett.

Thomas H. Broad is 78 and is holidaying with his daughter Mrs Bell of Mt Bryan. He came to Burra in the early days as a wheelwright, being paid £1 a week. He was successful for a while at the Victorian goldfields and on returning became a successful sheep farmer at Sod Hut for 25 years. He then sought better land in the Hundred of Bright which proved to be disastrous. He has three sons and seven daughters: Mrs Nicholls (WA), Mrs Bell (Mt Bryan), Mrs Hopkins (WA), Mrs Burton (MT Bryan), Mrs Hare (Burra), Mrs Kutchenmeister [sic] (Burra), Mrs Bell (Kapunda), John (WA), Thomas (Burra) & Henry (Qld). Mrs Broad at 74 is in good health and presently living with Mrs Hare (Kooringa).

Obituary. Mrs Catherine Bock died 29 June after a few days serious illness, though she had been ailing for the last three years. A week before her death she had a paralytic stroke. She came to Burra in 1855 and married the late Theodore Bock in the old Church of England on Limestone Hill. Her husband, who preceded her to Burra, worked at the old brewery next to the original Burra Hotel now the Hospital and later at the Unicorn Brewery. Mrs Bock died under the same roof where she had her first engagement as a domestic servant. She leaves three daughters and two sons: Mrs Cousins (Adelaide), Mrs W.I. Ker (Burra), Mrs F. Ker (Bundaleer), John (Broken Hill) and Theodore (WA).

Redruth Reformatory. On Sunday it was reported that Agnes Dyke (sister to the notorious Dyke who is serving a long sentence in Adelaide Gaol) and Bertha Learmouth had escaped. An immediate search failed to locate them. This is the third time they have escaped and points to the need for greater surveillance. How they escaped is a mystery, as all doors and windows remained locked and it cannot be seen where or how they scaled the wall. On the last escape two or three months ago they had a bad a time of it and were finally found at Tothill’s Creek.

Burra Town Council

Editorial on Benevolence.

The writer discusses the recent success in raising money for the Burra Benevolent Society, but also the need for it and the need to keep the aims of the society constantly before the public. Half the world doesn’t know how the other half lives and this is as true in Burra as anywhere. There is also considerable unknown local charity, which is just as well or the responsibility of the Society would be of much larger dimensions.

2nd Leader on the SA Ministerial Crisis.

Mr O’Loughlin, the senior member for Burra, resigned as Government Whip because the new coalition dropped proposals to lower the franchise qualifications for the Legislative Council.

Burra Mine. Driving continues and prospects are still promising, although in the interests of economy one set of men have been discharged in the last week.

Weather. 22 points of rain fell in the last week.

Football. The fancy costume football match on Wednesday went off well in fine weather. It began with a novel procession, which drew a large crowd and the match enabled £26-6-0 to be handed to the Benevolent Society. A social followed in the evening at the Commercial Hotel.

The positions held by the vanished Thomas Shortridge have been filled as follows:

Salvation Army. Annual meeting last Wednesday. It was addressed by Rev. T.B. Angwin, Rev. J. Allen & Captain Ross. The latter recounted his own rescue from the depths of sin by an Army Social Officer 12 years ago in Queensland. Some 300 people attended.

Streetlights. The arc lamp on Henderson’s corner is proving troublesome and complainants say it is inadequate as a replacement for the lamp at the pump – especially for those needing to use the troughs at night. Last Thursday an accident occurred there when a driver drove his horse full butt against the trough in the dark, being unable to see the railing. The horse was nastily gashed on the chest and the driver shot over the front of his vehicle. On Monday the lamp went out after only one hour.

The Reformatory Girls

Agnes Dykes and Martha Learmouth were recaptured by M-C Grosser about four miles southeast of Hamilton at about 4 a.m. on Wednesday. They were curled up asleep in the back of an Afghan Hawker’s van while he slept across the front. Grosser had followed the trail of the two red-headed girls through Black Springs and Waterloo. They had worn out their shoes in rough walking and were barefooted. They were taken 14 miles to Marrabel barefooted and there the landlady at the hotel gave advice and helped them put their shoes on. They continued to the train at Saddleworth and thence to Burra and the Reformatory. They claim to have escaped by scaling the wall and though this is scarcely credible they will not say anything to involve anyone else in their escape.

Burra DC. Election results show that each nominated Councillor was elected unopposed and J.A. Pearce was elected as auditor.

Redruth Court, 6 July

James Ryan was fined 20/- or 14 days for drunkenness.

James Ryan was given 2 months in gaol for using indecent language at Aberdeen in the hearing of young school girls.

Redruth Correspondent: Mt T.F. Bentley has secured the position on engine driver at Deland & Black’s mill at Blyth and he and his family left for there on Friday.

The daughter of Rev. J. & Mrs Allen is critically ill.

The Muff Football Match. The whole affair is covered in some detail in an article of 12⁄3 columns. The procession and its participants are described. Of note was a dilapidated Aborigines’ cart that is described in some detail. It had written on the side Yendinna Jack, Hergott 15 tons. There was a back-bush missionary’s vehicle that also rather libelled the missionary effort. Other participants and their disguises are listed. As well as the football game there were apparently some novel races with a host of very small prizes. The game was ‘devoid of scientific play, the contestants being satisfied to make themselves as funny as possible’. The social receives about 3⁄4 column report on speeches and toasts.

[Personal interest. C. Fuss went as a coachman. C. Fuss also won a comb in the 1⁄4 mile walk and in the 1⁄4 mile race C. Fuss won a rattle and R. Fuss some buttons.]

[Died 6 July 1904.]

Obituary. William Splane died at Andrews’ Homes, Mitcham last week aged 87. He once had a bootmaker’s business in the shop now occupied by Mr A. Bennett and his name can still be seen on the side wall. His wife survives. [William Splane died 6 July 1904 and his wife Eliza Splane died 25 September 1910. A son died in Kooringa as a child in 1861.]

Obituary. John Lavoun, only [surviving] son of Mrs George Jordan, died at Lawn Hill Queensland from fever and bronchitis. All Mrs Jordan’s sons have died unexpectedly: one was shot in his trap, one drowned and one died on his way to Balranald. [Ann Jordan was previously Ann Lavoun or Lavourn and was born Ann Trotter.]

Cr Snell is 72 and was a member of the first Council. He was elected a councillor last year and is going strong for the Mayoral position in the future. He has raised a large family [of 12]. Of them John is a linotype operator at the Advertiser and formerly worked at the Burra Record, Fred is at Pt Pirie, Joe lives at Broken Hill, Mrs Ralph and Miss Flo Snell are at broken Hill, Miss W. White is in Adelaide and Miss Annie lives in Burra.

Harry Vivian is 58 and full of geniality, sympathy and kindness. He was ‘carted’ to Burra in a bullock dray with his parents in 1855 and became a cowboy at the mines and later was a bullock driver for 19 years. He took wool etc. to Pt Adelaide and made his first trip to the Barrier in 1863. He was bullocky for Harry Skews and Mr John Pearce of the Mt Bryan Hotel. He took a public-house in 1881 and was licensee of Opie’s for six years before moving to the Commercial Hotel where he has been ever since.

John I. Sangster writes as President of the Burra Benevolent Society thanking all for their support and especially the young ladies whose bazaar recently produced £13-14-1 and those connected with the Muff football match that provided £26-6-0.

The Rose of Sharon Tent IOR had a financial meeting in the Institute Lodge Room last Thursday. The funds total £3,101-16-6 and the Juvenile Branch has £334-13-6. There are 158 adult members and 38 junior members. The new C.R. is Bro. E.J. Harris (and the Past C.R. Bro. Thomas Richards).

A Cow visited the Commercial Hotel on Sunday evening and consumed some apple pies. On the previous visit by one on Wednesday it had a drink. In both cases the cows were owned by Rechabites who are shocked to think the animals should so far forget themselves as to eat and drink at the Commercial Hotel.

Burra Institute Committee has accepted tenders for painting and repairs:

C. & T. Tiver £19-5-6 for mason work and D. Jones £27-10-0 for painting.

The Phosphate Fields

16 or 17 years ago speculators were attracted to the area because of the alleged discovery of silver in the Black Hills. Residents may remember the ‘Joker’ claim and even on the ‘Fairview’ claim area a shaft was put down for silver and went through 70% rock phosphate. Several private syndicates tested the hills for silver and a lot of money was lost in the attempt. Several years passed and F.A.S. Field was attracted to the spot by the discovery of phosphate rock and he prospected the area at intervals for three years and about three years ago a fairly large deposit was discovered and 120 tons of high grade stone was sent away. So satisfactory was the assay that the Adelaide Artificial Manure Co. was formed and further work undertaken.

Numerous claims were then pegged out, but many were forfeited on failing to meet the conditions of the leases. Many were waiting to see what the principal players would achieve. Eventually only those with some capital and determination remained. Development work is still going on with the ‘Fairview’ claim of Messrs Field & Clutterbuck, pending erection of a manufacturing works. The lode has been proved to 25ft deep and 100ft wide at an average 60% tricalcic of phosphate at the north open cut. The south open cut is about 111⁄2 chains away and is opened to 75ft deep and 137ft wide and the stuff varies from 50 to 85%, but the country is treacherous with big variations in quality within a few yards. There is 200 tons at grass and some have estimated 1 million tons in sight.

Between the two open cuts is a hill rising about 100ft and a large costeen trench proves the lode to be 400ft wide on the rise.

Just north of ‘Fairview’ is a claim called ‘Lillydora’, held by a local syndicate. A high grade deposit has been opened by costeens, trenches and shafts and a 10-ton sample averaged 63.40%.

North of that are two other claims with little work done; held by J.C. Killicoat and R.W. Tawcett.

North again is a claim held by E.N. Finch & Sons, which they are opening up and where they have exposed a large body of silicious rock phosphate averaging 50-60%. Phosphate has not been traced further north.

To the south of ‘Fairview’ about four miles a square mile is held by Messrs Field & Kickebusche. This is now being opened up and tested. Samples vary from 65 to 94% and 12 samples across 100yds averaged 76%.

The claims are 18 miles southeast of Burra. The country is desolate mallee with wild hops bushes and the Burra Creek skirts the south end of the ‘Fairview’ claim

Editorial on the Political Situation in SA where the Jenkins Government was an uneasy coalition.

The Arc Lamp is not proving to be satisfactory.

Burra Poultry Club met on Tuesday and heard a paper by J. Drew: Pure Breeds v. Barndoors.

A Mr [Walter] Patterson was fined £1 for riding in the goods train on Friday. Tommy Halls collected the amount out of kindness to the man who was penniless and had him released on Saturday evening.

Obituary. Stephen J. Paul Kruger, former President of the Transvaal Republic from 1882-1900, died on Thursday in Holland. He was born at Rustenburg in Cape Colony on 10 October 1825 and has resided in Europe since 1900. His wife died in South Africa early in 1901.

‘Not a Ratepayer’ writes in amazement at the way in which Burra footpaths are used as cycle tracks mornings and evenings.

Cattle Yards. Bagot, Shakes & Lewis have been preparing the scene of their new sale yards for some weeks and on Monday tenders were let to Messrs Baker & Rosewall for the erection of cattle yards. The convenience of having both yards close together is apparent and will be appreciated by buyers.

[The paper on 3 August identifies the place as near the brewery. This sounds as though they were adding cattle yards to the existing sheep yards, but the article is not really clear on details.]

Weather. In the last week the weather was rough with hurricane force winds that damaged outbuildings and carried some corrugated iron over 50yds. The arc lamp was damaged at Henderson’s. There was driving rain and a brief fall of snow with hail on Thursday; just enough for a few snowballs.

Burra Town Council

The Railway Commissioner does not think a lamp is needed at the station gate. In fact he thinks that the station road should be closed and that access to the station should be via the parallel Council road.

[This of course would transfer cost to the Council and they were reluctant to agree to it for this reason as well as because the difference in height created access problems requiring further expenditure as well as ongoing maintenance costs. Eventually the answer was to be a one-way road with entry via the Council road and exit via the SAR road. The Council road referred to is Railway Terrace. The SAR road is now closed.]

W. Carpenter asked for additional mantles for the Redruth streetlamps due to storm damage.

The Salvation Army was given approval to place a lamp in front of the Barracks.

The arc lamp will be raised 6ft and the lamp near the Redruth Bridge will be raised 3ft and stayed.

The 1903 assessment with necessary amendments will be used for 1904.

Redruth Court, 16 July

Billy Bruse is the oldest footballer in Burra. [Presumably this refers to William Henry Bruse born in 1858 and who thus was 46 at this time.]

Accident. C.C. Heinrich of the Burra Hotel was investigating a problem with his acetylene generator with a candle in his hand when an explosion occurred. Flame leapt several feet and Mr Heinrich was lucky to escape with only a slightly burnt wrist.

Obituary. James Dew aged 14, eldest son of Mr Fred Dew of Springbank, died last week. He attended Sunday school, caught a cold the next day and died two days later. [Born 2 March 1891: died 14 July 1904 aged 13. Sadly for the family a brother, Frederick James had also died in 1886 aged 11 months.]

Obituary. Mr Luke Teddy died at Broken Hill on Wednesday at the residence of his daughter Mrs J. Thomas. He came to SA 54 years ago aged 20. He worked in the Burra Mine for some time before going like so many to the Victorian goldfields. He returned to the Burra Mine before leaving to engage in farming. About 20 years ago with failing health he sold the farm at Baldina and retired to Redruth and only recently went to Broken Hill. As a young man he was a noted pugilist and much of his later physical affliction was due to that. About 30 years ago he became noted for the sincerity and zeal of his religious life. He could neither read nor write, but despite that he had a thorough knowledge of scripture and became a power for good in the community. He was a prominent member of the Methodist Church and a frequent visitor to the sick and dying. For the last 15 years he was totally blind. He suffered greatly due to the loss of his wife six years ago, since when his health and spirits had rapidly declined. He died aged 74 leaving two sons and three daughters. He was buried in Broken Hill and a memorial service was held at Redruth Methodist Church on Sunday.

[Interestingly he married Julia Thomas (18) at the Congregational Chapel in Kooringa 6 November 1851.]

Poultry. A summary of J. Drew’s paper, Pure Breed v. Barn Doors is printed.

XV, 636, 27 July 1904, page 2

Editorial on Farming. It discussed recent poor seasons and Government aid, which has had to be paid back leaving some farmers worse off than ever. The subdivision of the Shafton Estate has brought more families into the area. Modern machinery means that cleaning, winnowing, sorting and bagging are things of the past: the reaper does the lot and can even save the wheaten chaff if necessary.

Weather. The season’s most severe frost was last Thursday.

Tomorrow is the third anniversary of the great snow fall in which drifts up to 6ft high were recorded.

Rain out east has been useful with almost an inch at Mongolata where the dams are full. Baldina Creek flowed, but Stone Chimney Creek did not.

Rabbits are still very plentiful despite frequent shooting parties.

Rev. T.B. Angwin will deliver his popular lecture on Astronomy this evening in the Methodist Lecture Hall. Telescopic photos will be shown by a powerful lantern. Proceeds will aid Home Missions.

Burra Institute. A dance will follow a concert there tonight.

Salvation Army. The Biorama at the Barracks on Thursday exceeded all previous cinematographs to visit Burra. The Biorama Co. had the latest bioscope projector as well as a powerful compound dissolving lantern. The pictures were the most brilliant ever seen in Burra. The Biorama overcomes the quivering, which is not at all pleasing to the eye caused by other machines. The orchestral music was appropriate and pleasing.

Streetlights. A group of boys made their own comment on the problems with street lamps when they knocked the bottom out of two gin bottles and put a candle in each. One the stuck ‘up a tree’ at Henderson’s Corner and put the other in the lamp near the Institute. They burned well until M-c Grosser made then take their lights down.

The new lights have clearly failed to meet requirements. Acetylene lamps seem to be the only solution to the failure of the arc and ‘Best’ lamps, which were simply a waste of money. Night after night they fail completely within an hour of being lit.

The Local Branch of the School of Mines held a social in St Mary’s schoolroom on Wednesday. A sumptuous repast was followed by parlour games. At present there are 13 students, but up to 30 have participated in recent times. The dressmaking course of 13 weeks teaches drafting, cutting and fitting and costs £1-1-0. Officers of the local branch are: President, Mrs J.C. Sandland; Vice-President, Mrs P.L. Killicoat; Treasurer, Mrs S. Burns & Secretary, Mrs J. McCallum. The school has existed for three years.

Children’s Bazaar. About three years ago several young girls organised a bazaar and in their first effort raised £6 for an invalid’s chair for the Burra Hospital. 12 months later they raised £16, which went towards the hospital acetylene gas fund. This year their third effort was held in the auction mart and was opened by the Mayoress Mrs J. Winnall. £20 was raised. The girls mentioned in the report are the founder, Nellie Vivian and Ivy Ward, Millie Pascoe, Myrtle Berriman, Nita Pearce, Ruby Sandland, Eileen Johnson, Rita Vivian, Joy Sangster, Stella Moody, Kathleen Johnson and Dolly Vivian.

Quarter Master Scott (head teacher at Burra School) went to Adelaide on Saturday to assist in the presentation to Col. Catt of Gladstone for over 20 years of service to the SA Infantry. QM Scott himself has qualified for the long service medal for 20 years service and will receive it in a month or two.

Theft. On 9 July Mr W. Phin of Ironmine sent Peter Pascoe to Swan Reach to get a stallion. He gave him a cheque for £14 to be handed to the vendor. Pascoe has not been seen since, the cheque has been cashed and missing also are the horse, its saddle etc., a new overcoat and leggings.

Obituary. Rose Allen, eldest daughter of Rev. James Allen, died last Wednesday. Though ill for some time, she took a serious turn for the worse a fortnight ago. [Born Marian Rose Allen 14 September 1869.]

Mr Richards of the motor and cycle depot in Redruth took his motorcycle to Waterloo on Thursday, leaving Redruth at 2 p.m. and returning at 7.45 p.m. He covered the 80 odd miles in 53⁄4 hours including stops to transact business en route.

I. Villis was loading wood at Baldina Scrub near Douglas last week when he found an 1836 gold half sovereign and a black sixpence. They must have been there for many years.

Rabbits. Rabbiting is popular at present and it is providing lucrative employment. In several places to the east there are little canvas towns. Rabbits are being dug out by day and trapped at night. One party combining the two methods got 396 in 24 hours. A wagon-load of 1,000 rabbits was sent to Pt Adelaide from the Burra station at the end of last week and another left on Monday.

William Pryor cut his thumb off in an accident with an axe last week. An attempt has been made to reattach it. He is 72.

The old Bible Christian Church, after many years of good service the church in East St [sic], has been sold to a local buyer; it is said for the purpose of use as a skating rink. Vast repairs to the windows, doors and the building itself would be needed before this could happen.

[The church was not in East St, but was on the corner of Bridge Terrace and Bridge St East.]

Mr Pascoe, who is wanted over the theft of Mr Phin’s cheque and horse etc., has not been seen since a sighting at Sedan on 17 July. He is thought to have left the state.

Burra Institute Tonight. Fitzgerald Bros. Biograph, vitagraph and wax works. Over 12 miles of film will be put through the machine. 2/- and 1/6.

The arc lamp. The chain of the arc lamp broke one night last week as W. Geake was putting it up after the moonlight period. He caught the lamp as it fell and only narrowly escaped being precipitated some 12ft to the ground. On recent nights it has burnt fairly well and on Friday actually managed to keep alight till 10.30!

Rev. T.B. Angwin’s lecture on Astronomy is reported in c. 1⁄2 column.

The season will be a late one and large quantities of grain have perished. Late sown crops will benefit from recent rains, though frost has done some damage. Crops south, west and in the Robertstown-Eudunda area are doing well.

Arbor Day was held at World’s End school last Wednesday. The school stands alone and is devoid of even a shelter shed and until recently lacked a tank. A recent concert (the items and performers of which are listed) raised £3 for a shelter shed.

A Bolt. A horse attached to Domenick Pizzo’s cart in Paradise bolted on Monday. Almost immediately the cart was left behind on a fence, but the horse continued down Kingston St and across the bridge before taking to the footpath at E.J. Harris’s where it narrowly missed Mr F.J. Packard. It turned into Chapel St, but on attempting to enter the lane behind the Commercial Hotel the dangling harness got caught on a post and the adventure came to a halt.

Editorial on ‘Things Political’. The article concerns the difficulties of a State Government hanging on by a single vote.

Shearers are passing through Burra in large numbers, heading for eastern stations.

Burra Waterworks. The Government advises that no instructions have been given to cut water from the public water troughs but in a fine example of double speak it also advises that the policy is that no free supplies of water are granted in county water districts and unless the Town Council pays 2/- per 1,000 gallons for such supplies those ‘instructions’ will be enforced.

The Cornish boiler has been taken from its bed to be replaced by an up-to-date oil engine.

Grasshoppers are present in large numbers in the hills around Burra and south of the town a paddock has been stripped bare of a crop.

Rabbits, despite the destruction of 3-4,000 a week at Baldina, seem to be maintaining their population without trouble.

One rabbiter last week unearthed a nest of 11 young and in an adjacent burrow captured 45 varying in age from 3 days to 4 weeks.

F.G. Dawson presented a paper: Does it pay to keep poultry?

Redruth Court, 17 August

Patrick Cull alias John Flannaghan (18) and John Joseph Barton alias Albert Thompson (17) both of Brooklyn Park were charged on the information of James Macklvie with the larceny of a pair of trousers, pair of scissors, one pannikin, one comb, one brush, one towel, one reel of cotton & needles, one shirt, 4lb of sugar and one waterproof sugarbag, totalling in all to the value of 15/-.

James Macklvie said he was camped in a hut on Princess Royal estate on 14 August when the thefts took place.

M-C Grosser described tracing the accused to a point near Point Pass and finding them with the stolen articles. Cull had tried to escape, but halted when three warning shots were fired. The pair had escaped from Brooklyn Park Reformatory last July.

Both had told a reporter for the Record that they would rather go to gaol than back to the Reformatory, but that is where they were sent. It was Barton’s second attempt to escape and Flannaghan’s third.

A Strike! The rules of the Booborowie Quadrille Assembly say there must be no ‘engaging’ before the dance. Only when the MC calls ‘take your partners’ may the young men seek their partners. A few nights ago the girls rebelled and demanded the right to make prior engagements for dances. When the rules were enforced they all filed out of the hall and the dance had to be abandoned. A mass meeting is to be held, where no doubt the ladies’ wishes will prevail.

The Bon Accord Crossing. A petition has been presented to the Railways Commissioner by the Hon. J. Lewis calling for a lamp at the Bon Accord crossing. Many years ago there was a lamp at the [adjacent] station gate, but rigid economies have seen it removed.

St Mary’s. A meeting of seat-holders on Wednesday appointed a Patronage Committee to act to select a minister to succeed Rev. W.G.M. Murphy.

Baldina Methodist Church held its anniversary on Sunday when Rev. J. Allen conducted afternoon and evening services. The tea meeting is today.

Burra Mine. An open day at the mine on Sunday afternoon drew a constant stream of visitors, young and old and of both sexes. Captain Prior was present to explain matters to the uninformed. The old cry is want of money for development work. Nevertheless a shaft will be sunk on a spot close to Burra Hospital in the ruins of the old brewery cellar, where it is said copper was found when sinking for foundations. The progress will be watched with unusual interest.

Editorial on Population

The editor argues that SA needs an increasing population for progress and prosperity.

Mice have established a honeycomb of holes under virtually every bush in the hills around Burra and a heavy rain is needed to destroy large numbers of them.

Dancing. The district within a ten mile radius has an estimated 200 marriageable young ladies, which no doubt explains the sudden popularity of dancing in the town.

Lost. A buggy-load of young people got lost in the dark on the way back to Burra from the Baldina tea meeting and having taken the wrong turning reached home in the early morning instead of that evening.

The Phosphate Fields. No work is currently going on. F.A.S. Field has sent away a 5-ton sample that has assayed to 70%. Work is halted pending a decision from BHP on erecting suitable processing machinery at Pt Pirie. The cost of cartage to Adelaide is prohibitive.

The sample of rock sent away by E.N. Finch & Sons was satisfactory and they also hold an area of richer material.

Mr W. Phin of Ironmine has recovered his horse and equipment from Adelaide where it had been left at the Buck Head Hotel. It is believed Pascoe has got away to Victoria.

Unclaimed letters are held for, among others, Dowd Singh & Lakha Singh.

Baldina Methodist Church tea meeting revealed that the Sunday school had 13 boys and 13 girls and 5 teachers with an average attendance of 10 pupils and 3 teachers. Financially it was sound:

Credit on hand from 1903 £1-8-11⁄2

Income from collections 1904 £12-0-0

Expenditure in 1904 £13-3-4

Credit in hand 4-91⁄2

The anniversary collections £2-7-10

Tea £5-13-6

Collection at public meeting 15-6

Supper £2-1-5

Anniversary total £10-18-3

Cash in hand after the anniversary £11-3-01⁄2

Since the debt on the church is £8 and the annual repayment is £4 there is ample money on hand.

[These figures show the financial importance of the anniversary to such churches and it is also clear that much of it came from townsfolk who went out to the outlying churches on such occasions.]

New Stock Yards. For many years Bagot, Shakes & Lewis have held their monthly sales in the yards adjoining the Burra Hotel, selling cattle horses and the like there and selling sheep at the yards near the old Unicorn Brewery. Having two yards together is an obvious advantage and the firm recently decided to build new yards near the sheep yards for cattle etc. Messrs Baker & T. & W. Rosewall won the contract and have done a first class job. There are 20 yards 18ft x 14ft with a 5ft gate in each with two races from the open yard up to the auctioneer’s box. The stock will be driven in the lower gate fronting Paxton Square and drafted into the pens made of 4” diameter mallee rails with posts 12” x 12” and topped with white peppermint rails. The pens are on a slight slope for drainage. The selling yard is enclosed in a wall and covered with timber and iron. The carpentry was by George Bartholomaeus and the ironwork by W. Henderson. The first sale in the new yards will be held next Friday.

William Parks, son of Thomas Parks, has found employment at Lakeland, Dapto NSW. Several Burra identities are there including two daughters of Mr Parks and John Jenkins, youngest son of Thomas Jenkins.

Obituary. Mr J. Rogers, son-in-law of Mr S. Pearce of Leighton, died in WA last week. His young son and daughter had been staying with Mrs Pearce and were on their way home, arriving just in time for the funeral.

Mr Richard Field is living in retired comfort at ‘Monavea’ four miles west of Burra. Mr & Mrs Field came to SA on 15 November 1855 in the Victoria Regia and went to live first at Islington. Twelve months later they came to Burra where Mr Field worked for the English & Australian Copper Co. In 1859 he moved to Hamilton, Victoria where he took and worked land for four years. In late 1863 he returned to Burra and again worked for a time with E. & A. Copper co. before working at the Burra Mine. In 1868 he took land in the Hd of Hanson now known as ‘Monavea’ and has been there ever since. He enjoyed a succession of good seasons. There are five sons and one daughter: G.A. (Gilberton), J.R., W.H., F.A.S. & A.W. (Burra) and Mrs Wyett of Henley Beach Road. Mr Field is 78 and though feeble is in fairly good health. Mr Field is 77 and also as well as can be expected.

Weather. There is still no rain.

Baldina crops are poor, thin, short and becoming discoloured.

At Black Springs crops are fair.

Farrell’s Flat and Hanson have some nice green patches, but mice there are wreaking havoc.

Leighton area is doing better.

Since the above was written some rain has fallen. On Monday there was a change with driving dust and visibility virtually zero, but in the afternoon rain set in and 69 points were recorded. The rain was general and to the east falls varied from 12 to 50 points. At Gumbowie snow fell thickly.

Rain is continuing as we go to press.

Rabbits. Mr Jericho has now given up rabbiting for the season, as the weather is getting too warm to convey rabbits the distances involved without their becoming tainted.

Parties now operating are taking only skins and scalps.

Redruth Court, Friday

William Barkely (22) was charged with embezzling various moneys up to the amount of 11/81⁄2 from his employer, W.E. Jordan. The accused worked for Jordan, operating a van in the Hanson district. Jordan discovered discrepancies between sums in the customers’ books and those in the cart book. The accused was bailed for a later hearing.

Editorial on: The Embezzlement Case

The editor expresses the view in light of the evidence that Mr Jordan acted precipitously and without discretion and that while Barkley may have acted without authority and indiscreetly, he did not act dishonestly and did not personally profit from his actions. The matter had much better been dealt with quietly with an explanation and a reprimand if necessary.

Eight Hours Day was celebrated in Burra on Thursday with businesses closed and picnics and shooting parties were the order of the day.

Bagot, Shakes & Lewis opened their new sale yards near the old Unicorn Brewery on Friday. Rain fell during the sale, which was taken as a good omen. The shed is rather low and dark and it is likely that skylights will be put in.

The Tradesmen’s Ball last Wednesday at the Institute was largely attended and much enjoyed by the close on 300 present.

Redruth [Methodists] held their annual Wattle Blossom Fair on Friday. It was very successful and raised over £55. [Personal interest: the Flower Stall was run by Mrs Goodwin, Misses Fuss, Finch (2) & Jones.]

William Barkley writes thanking all those who stood by him through the court case, on behalf of himself and his family. He especially thanks Mr W.J. Richards who gave him financial support and Mr & Mrs Burns of the Royal Exchange Hotel for accommodating his solicitor free of charge.

Redruth Court, Wednesday

The embezzlement case against William Barkley is reported at length in about 21⁄3 columns. The court was crowded and the case was heard by P. Lane & J. Sampson.

Counsel examined carefully the operations of the round of the van driven by Barkley in the Hanson district and also his behaviour while taking charge of the business during Jordan’s illness. Jordan alleged that he had been robbed by Barkley’s behaviour in allowing unauthorised discounts on accounts when they were paid and by his purchase of such things as eggs at prices in excess of those he was instructed to pay – 51⁄2d a dozen instead of 5d. On the other hand much of the evidence revealed Barkley to have worked very long hours, sometimes being out with the van till after midnight, and to have done other work suggesting he was diligent and reliable. His virtual running of the business during Jordan’s illness was also brought up. Jordan was shown to have dismissed Barkley abruptly without warning and without asking for any explanation and without giving any reason. There was no evidence to show that the accused had benefited financially from any of his actions.

The bench decided there was no case to answer.

A second and associated charge of falsifying the books was also dismissed.

The Tradesmen’s Ball is reported in detail extending for over 1 column and included descriptions of the gowns worn.

Burra Town Council

The Railway Commissioner has declined to place a lamp at the Bon Accord crossing. He says there are only two trains after dark; there has been no light there for many years and no approach to an accident for the past 15 years.

The Mayor has been instructed to wait on the Commissioner of Public Works on the matter.

Mrs Develaing’s claim for damages for falling over a footbridge in Kooringa was not entertained.

The contractor for lighting the Kooringa lamps is to be informed that they go out too soon.

Obituary. Mrs E. Reynolds died on 17 August at her residence Amherst Victoria aged 80. A colonist of 65 years. She was the mother of T. Reynolds of Booborowie. She came to Adelaide with her brother, Mr W. Willmott, in the Buckinghamshire in 1839 and was married at Trinity Church Adelaide in 1845. She then went overland to Victoria with her husband and has lived there ever since. She leaves a grown-up family.

The Old Bible Christian Church. Now that the Burra Defence Rifle Club target is no more the Bible Christian Church windows are being used for the same purpose.

Mice. The town is threatened with an invasion of mice.

Burra Town Council has decided to fund one water trough in Aberdeen for the travelling public only – locals are not to use it.

Sampson’s Hall in Thames St [formerly the Primitive Methodist Sunday School] was the venue for a pleasant dance on Wednesday. Many learners put in an appearance and went through the sets etc. in preparation for the Ladies’ Ball on 27 September.

Burra Mine. The operations near the hospital are damaging the building. A large portion of plaster has been shaken from the main ward and the mason work of the ward is in a very dangerous state. The Board have asked that operations cease and have also asked for an inspection by the Superintendent of Public Buildings.

The shaft is down about 26ft, but so far there is no trace of ore.

Work on the main shaft progresses steadily, but prospects there are not as good as they were some time ago. The Mine is presently employing only 13 men and boys, so that work is inevitably slow.

R.M. Harvey, the popular manager of the Bank of Australasia in Burra, is leaving after 15 years here. He has been transferred to Shepparton in Victoria. He joined the bank in Victoria when only 16 and served as a clerk at Bairnsdale, Ballarat, Creswick & Kingston before being appointed manager of Cairns in Queensland after only 7 years. He then went to Townsville and Pt Augusta before Burra. Here he has worked up the branch to ‘voluminous dimensions’ and leaves ‘not a single enemy behind’. He has been warden of St Mary’s Church for many years, Chairman of the Burra Hospital Board, Secretary of the Burra Branch of the Agricultural Bureau, President of the Burra Institute and has been associated with everything appertaining to the welfare of the town. He leaves Burra on 27 September.

Mr Thomas Parks has had a slight stroke and as well as being unable to get around his eyesight has been affected.

The Season. The north-eastern area from Burra to Olary via Petersburg is looking well. There should be some good crops around Paratoo and feed is splendid with spear grass to 2ft. Sheep are in good condition and the wool clip is excellent. Shearing is in full swing.

XV, 643, 14 Sep. 1904, page 3

Mt Bryan East. Crops are backward and farmers will get little reward. Rabbits are alarmingly thick and mice are numerous.

Mt Bryan. A small circus visited Mt Bryan recently. It was the first to perform there and though hardly impressive to those who were familiar with larger circuses, it was a real treat for those who had never seen one.

Weather. Very little rain has fallen recently and farmers are looking for it. On Friday it was very disagreeable with hurricane winds and thick dust before a cool change in the evening. Sunday was cold with a few light showers.

Friday’s wind and dust damaged crops and to the east the dust stopped the movement of teams unable to face the drifting sand.

Alf Bevan employed by W. Truscott at the slaughterhouse two miles east of Burra narrowly escaped losing an eye on Sunday. While dressing a sheep the knife flew up and lodged within a half-an-inch of his left eye, penetrating to the bone. The bleeding was stopped with difficulty and the sight of the eye was hazy on Monday, but no serious trouble is anticipated.

Mr Chesterfield (overseer) and Mr Mullins (labourer) were working on Mr Gebhardt’s house at Mt Bryan on Wednesday when a gust of wind moved scaffolding around a chimney and both men fell 25ft. Mullins received slight concussion and cuts and bruises, but it is not likely he will be laid up. Chesterfield was shaken with some cuts and bruises. That they both survived with so little damage is amazing.

Fred Rogers, youngest son of John Rogers of Baldina, was riding to F.T. Jones’ station on Monday night on his bicycle. At the 8-mile peg at Hangman’s Hut he was thrown off and broke his right collarbone. On regaining consciousness after a few minutes he rode six miles to Mr Jones and after a painful and sleepless night walked back to his father’s at Baldina in the morning. He was brought in to Burra in a trap and attended to by Dr Sangster.

Court.

Patrick Welsh, a shearer, arrived in Burra a few days ago and began ‘loading up’. He was fined 10/- for using obscene language and 5/- for drunkenness. [The paper expresses the latter as an infringement of the Width of Tyres Act for carrying too much load.]

Kooringa Court, 13 September

Patrick Royal: Fined 10/- or 7 days for indecent language

Fined 5/- or 3 days for drunkenness

Fined £1 or 14 days for resisting arrest

Fined 5/- or 7 days plus 7/- damages for breaking a chair

Fines totalled £2-2-0 and he was taken to the cells, being unable to pay. He was a resident of Alberton.

Mrs Murphy [wife of Rev. Murphy] President of St Mary’s Mothers’ Union, was presented with a silver cake basket at Mrs F. Treloar’s at the ‘Smelts’ on Monday, as she is leaving Burra.

Mr Jericho tried a different method of handling rabbits on Monday. Previously they were bagged and this is not suitable in warmer weather. This load was hung from crossbars on the wagon. Monday’s blasting wind and dust provided the most adverse conditions.

R.M. Harvey has resigned from the Institute Committee after 13 years because of his removal to Victoria. A minute of appreciation for his services was recorded.

The Eastern Stock Route is much in use at present:

4,000 sheep are coming to Abberton Park for shearing.

800 from J. Ford’s Sturt Vale are coming in for shearing.

300 for Mr McBride are coming to Norman Farm for shearing.

500 ewes and lambs are heading for Elder’s Market.

300 sheep are coming from Ford’s Lagoon.

Editorial on the local industries and the bad season. Wheat promises to be poor this year, but wool is looking good. The town needs a diversity of production for stability: wheat, wool and mining.

Music. At the Trinity College exams held in Clare on 11 June, Miss Olive Phelan and Miss Imelda Linkson passed in music theory. They have been taught by the Sisters of St Joseph’s Church.

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. Firing in a shaft near the Hospital has damaged the building and repairs are to be carried out. If work is resumed there the firing will have to be very light, but resumption seems unlikely. There is no hope of the mine yielding returns unless it is unwatered. Development work is going on very slowly. Talk of pumping out the mine pool seems to have died again. All that has been done is to reject tenders when they have been called.

Burra Waterworks. The Government authorities are engaged in flushing pipes and raising stopcocks – some of which have been seen for the first time since they were installed. Most are in better condition than expected. An oil engine will, in future, do the work of the boilers and save the cost of fuel etc.

A Return Social Ball will be tendered the tradesmen of the town at the Institute on Tuesday by the ladies of the town. Setaro’s String Band has been engaged. Supper will be in the Lodge Room at 11 o’clock.

A Phosphate Treatment Plant is being erected at Port Pirie to treat rock from the mine about 15 miles east of Burra.

Burra Show today with an entertainment tonight in the Institute.

Rabbits are very bad. One party caught over 1,000 in rugged country, but the skin market has declined for all sorts: Good bucks 73⁄4 to 81⁄2d per lb

Seconds 6 to 61⁄2 per lb

Does 31⁄4 to 33⁄4d per lb

Small 2 to 3d per lb

Burra Show Soc. The Sheep Dog Field Trials held at Abberton Park on Wednesday were the best seen locally. Nine dogs were entered and a fair number of spectators attended. Details are given. Mr Crosbie’s ‘Scotty’ was a popular winner.

Editorial on the Embezzlement Case

The main discussion is on the suggestion by the plaintiff’s counsel that local JPs should not sit on the case. The writer sees SM Hinde’s dismissal of the case as an endorsement of the judgement and impartiality of the local JPs in dismissing the parallel case recently. They should be encouraged by Mr Hinde’s actions and his confidence in them.

The Season. With but little rain in September – a mere 53 points and a total for the year of only 956 points – farmers are facing a poor season.

AOF District Officers have visited and found the books to be in good order and are pleased with the way in which the lodge has come out of recent difficulties.

Hon. J. Lewis has introduced the Child’s Protection Bill, which is intended to prohibit smoking by those under 16 and to prohibit the sale or gift of tobacco products to them.

A Bolt. Mr H. Lockyer’s horse bolted with his trap at Carlsruhe on Thursday. The trap collided with a fence and broke its shafts. One wheel was badly damaged and the horse then broke free of the vehicle and ran on till exhausted.

Court, 20 September

Mrs Klaffus proceeded against her husband Charles Gustav Klaffus for a protection order under the Married Women’s Act. She said her husband had paid her just 10/- in five years. She was willing to go on supporting herself, but wanted the protection of the court and secure custody of her son. Mr Klaffus appeared in a merry condition: ‘But the well-known fencer was beyond making a speech.’

Mr Hinde gave an order for the custody of the son and one preventing the defendant cohabiting with his wife. ‘Oh, I say noddings ’gainst dat.’ said Charles Klaffus.

Walter Patterson, who rode a railway truck south on a goods train recently appeared at the Burra Show where he indulged in too much alcohol and ended up in the cells overnight. He was subsequently was fined 5/- or 3 days for drunkenness and £1 or 7 days for insulting behaviour. [See also XV, 635, 20 July 1904, page 2.]

James Douglas served 24 hours in the cells for drunkenness at a picnic.

Harvey after 15 years as manager of the Bank of Australasia. The form of the evening was essentially a banquet. Speakers were: J.F. Moore (Manager of the National Bank), H. Pinch, Mr Treloar, S. Burns, P.R. Scott, H. Roach, Mr James (assistant at the Bank of Australasia for three years), Hon. J. Lewis, E.F. Lockyer, F.A.S. Field, Mr McDonald & Mr Harkus [sic] (Mr Harcus, Mr Harvey’s successor).

The Embezzlement Case.

William Barkley was charged with embezzling certain sums of money from William Edgar Jordan, to wit 7/-, 6/5 and 15/6. Mr P. Nesbit KC and J. Winnall appeared for Jordan and J.R. Anderson for the accused.

Mr Nesbit began by suggesting that local feeling was such that the case would more satisfactorily be heard by Mr Hinde SM alone. Mr Hinde said that Mr Wilkinson had expressed his desire to leave the bench, but Mr Hinde prevailed upon him to remain. He said he would do so essentially as an observer. Mr Hinde said he had received communications that a similar case had been heard by the local JPs and they had dismissed it. He considered that for him to hear a parallel case would be very wrong, as it would be seen as a reflection on the local JPs, but he had to attend to hear the Klaffus v. Klaffus case. Mr Anderson thought the insult to the local JPs was without parallel.

Mr Nesbit said the defendant had control of the informant’s business for six months and it was no surprise that he was able now to start in business for himself.

The case ran along very similar lines to the previous one mentioned.

Jordan said Barkley had been in his employ for two years, buying produce, collecting accounts and selling groceries in the Hanson Farrell’s Flat area. He reluctantly admitted Barkley had built up the round. The buying and selling prices were fixed by Jordan. It was alleged that Barkley had sold below the stipulated price and purchased above it. There were discrepancies in the sets of books kept.

Evidence was also given that Jordan had agreed not to proceed further in the matter if Barkley would agree not to set up in business in Burra. Barkley had set up business in Burra.

Nesbit denied saying that Barkley had started his business with money obtained from Jordan. [Though he clearly implied as much.]

After hearing the evidence SM Hinde dismissed the case.

Another charge of falsifying the books was adjourned till 18 October.

James Moyle visited Burra after an absence of 27 years. He arrived in Burra with his parents in 1847, having come with them to SA in the British Sovereign. He went to work briefly in the Burra Mine in 1852 before going to the Victorian goldfields, returning in 1853. He then took land at Hill River and later in the Hundred of Tarcowie. He is now 69, well and living in retirement in Jamestown.

Accident. Miss Adams, school teacher of World’s End, was walking to Kooringa from the Burra Show with Miss Hughes, teacher of the Douglas School, when she was struck by the near side horse of a wagonette loaded with passengers as the driver pulled off the road to pass another vehicle. She was thrown forward in front of the horses and trampled. The vehicle then passed right over her, but fortunately all but one ankle lay between the wheels. The wheels passed over this ankle and a hoofs truck the back of her head. S. Burns was passing and took her to his home in his cart. The next day the ankle was very swollen and Dr Sangster was called in. Surprisingly she recovered well and was able to return to World’s End on Friday. The driver of the wagonette has not been identified.

The Burra Record appeared in a new format and with a redesigned masthead. The old Gothic curved heading was replaced by a straight one over a series of pictures appropriate to a rural area: a horse and bullock, kangaroo, dogs, Morphett’s Engine House, a ram, geese and fowls. The size of the page decreased in height and to five columns, but there were eight instead of four pages.

Young crops are being attacked and in places earlier in the season they consumed much seed so that some farmers had to sow a second time.

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. Development work proceeds slowly. Valuable ores have been found, but not in large quantities. The mooted erection of a concentration plant is not likely in the near future. The few tributers at work are in most cases unsuccessful.

It is expected the union will be a powerful one and will have an influence on the next election when they will bring out direct farmers’ advocates. They favour compulsory repurchase of land and closer settlement. The cry for more land is urgent as large families grow up.

Rabbit Eradication. A new way of serving notice for rabbit eradication has been introduced. Henceforth advertisements for two consecutive weeks in the Government Gazette and a paper circulating in the district is deemed the required notice for owners and occupiers of land to destroy rabbits, fill in burrows etc. in accordance with the Rabbit Suppression Act of 1879 and the Vermin District Act of 1894.

Burra Hospital Board. At the last monthly meeting Mr Moore was appointed chairman of the board to replace R.M. Harvey who resigned on leaving the district.

Rabbits. A party who invested in a horse and dray have done well trapping rabbits to the east and sending them to the Adelaide freezing works. A freezer in Burra ought to be remunerative.

Obituary. Rowland Rees, a former very active politician, died on Thursday aged 64. He and W.B. Rounsevell sat for Burra in 1881. Some years ago he went to WA, but had returned to Adelaide when he died. [Somewhat more might have been expected by way of an obituary given that not only had he been a long serving local member of Parliament, but had been the architect for several notable buildings in the town. He was born in 1840 and arrived in SA in 1869 on the Duke of Sutherland. For Burra he designed Roach’s Flour Mill in 1874 and in the same year the rebuilt Institute and the Redruth Wesleyan (later Methodist) Church. He designed the Royal Exchange Hotel in 1880 for Aberdeen and was also responsible for the Koonoona Woolshed. The registration says died 13 October 1904 aged 62.]

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. For months discoveries have been made and then dismissed as they proved impermanent. Work is being pursued in the main shaft – near Peacock’s Air Shaft, where rich ore was found, though it was soon worked out. Mr Pryor, the underground manager, is hopeful. Tributers are working other shafts, but with little success. The mine property is littered with hundreds of tons of decaying timber and thousands of tons of iron. The Electro-Magnetic Separation Works are abandoned and failed to generate the capital needed to develop the mine. There was talk that they were being purchased by a Broken Hill Co., but so far no effort has been made to remove them. It’s a pity no work has been done on Morphett’s Shaft. Much has been said about Bunts’s Shaft and it may yet lead to something. Tributers have been prevented from much work by the water rushing in. A gentleman visited recently and offered to supply suitable pumping machinery for £1,000. Surely if this is not accepted it is a sign something is ‘wrong in Denmark’.

Rabbits. A discussion is going on about a rabbit freezer for Burra. There is much support, but a location has to be chosen. The brewery cellars have been suggested.

Storm. There was a great storm on 18 October. It was not so strong in the town, but still removed roofs from sheds and outhouses. Gardens were damaged and fruit stripped from trees. It was worse to the east where traffic on the Baldina Road was halted and one load of wool was blown over by the wind. It also caused much damage towards Robertstown, Bright and Emu Downs where crops were badly damaged and in some places utterly destroyed. The flat country around Hallett and Canowie was badly affected and shearing at Princess Royal was suspended due to the lightning. Telegraph poles were bent double at Eudunda. The only useful aspect was the rain which totalled 1.09” in Burra and 1.25” at World’s End.

Over £90 was raised at the bazaar and the concert and dance raised about £25. The 8th report of the Rt Rev. James Maher of the Diocese of Pt Augusta said Kooringa was ‘one of our greatest burdens’ due to the small sprinkling of Catholics in the community. Rev. J.P. Redden, till his illness, and then Rev. W. O’Dowling, did all they could to meet the year’s demands and raised £71-16-3 for the term. The debt stands at £1,157-15-11. The property as it now stands cost some time ago over £5,000.

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. directors, T. Drew, & T.B. Gall with the secretary, V. Lawrence, inspected the Mine on Saturday. They were met by J. Drew, W. West & Mr Pryor. The directors returned to Adelaide by the afternoon train. A bulk sample of 50 cwt of ore has been sent for experiment. A half-yearly meeting of shareholders was held on Monday in Adelaide. The directors reported expenditure of £1,015 on 690’ of drives, 264’ of cross-cuts, 61’ of rises and 60’ of sinking, comprising driving at Tinline’s and Gall’s Shafts, cross-cutting at Grave’s & Gall’s and sinking at the Hospital and Slaughterhouse Shafts. Large quantities of milling ore had been found and from Gall’s Shaft 14 tons of marketable ore had realised £108. Arrangements for testing the milling ore are in hand to determine how it can be treated.

Why are roads to the market being fenced off when sheep cannot be driven through the main street?

Why are so many back streets closed?

The mine has been closed for many years. What is wrong with the directors?

Haymaking. Some very fair crops are being cut to the west of Burra, but to the east hardly six tons will be cut – growth is so short and thin.

Things are better towards Robertstown and Eudunda, but are still on average poor.

Red rust has rendered many hundreds of acres in the district useless even for hay.

Conditions around Mt Bryan and Hallett are better.

Editorial on Seasonable Hints

The writer urges greater conservation of water. The writer felt that even in bad years when crops failed, the average farmer should be able to conserve enough water to sustain a few acres of feed for some cows, some fruit and some vegetables and so be able to provide their own food and generate some income from eggs, butter, bacon, cheese, fruit and vegetables.

The 3rd son of E.N. Finch had been suffering from earache and recently Dr Sangster removed a piece of lead pencil from his ear. Mr Finch said he remembered the incident when the pencil got into his ear some five years ago. [The son was Edwin Finch who would have been a few weeks short of 20 at the time.]

Fire. At 11 p.m. on Monday night while closing up the Commercial Hotel Miss Vivian noted sparks coming from a chimney that appeared to be at the back of P. Callahan’s house. She told M-C Grosser who discovered the back room of Mr Pederson’s boot shop was alight. He broke in and just managed to extinguish the flames with buckets of water before they got to the canvas ceiling. Mr Vivian assisted and then went and told Mr Pederson. William Pederson said he had burnt rubbish in the fireplace about 6 p.m. and believing the fire to be extinguished had then placed other debris in the fireplace. Apparently this smouldered and then caught alight. Sparks from this, or from the chimney catching alight, in turn ignited the boards.

Editorial on Municipal Matters.

There is little need in Burra for general policy and Council can deal with matters as they arise. The boundaries of Council activity have long been laid down. ‘At present there are far more houses in town than are occupied owing to the scarcity of population.’

‘Those, however, who are left are struggling against odds for subsistence, and it is astonishing how some of them live.’

‘The Town Council has done good work of late years, and today the town is in a very satisfactory state.’

William Dearlove of Ketchowla has sent £2-2-0 to help the town’s poor at Christmas. Surely if someone 40 miles away can remember the town’s needy those resident in it can do no less.

Wingless grasshoppers are making havoc to the east of Burra.

W.J. Davey and his clever dog, Carlo, gave a novel entertainment on Wednesday night to a very fair audience. There will be a repeat at a matinee on Saturday 17 December.

Court Pride of Burra AOF will picnic on Princess Royal Estate at Johnson’s Creek on Wednesday 7 December.

Accident. A lady cyclist collided with the mail cart near Bleak house on Friday evening. The bicycle was somewhat damaged and the cyclist’s dress torn. She admitted she ought to have had a light attached to her vehicle.

A Bolt. Thomas Vivian’s horse took off from Drew & Crewes’ on Monday afternoon and made towards Redruth at a great pace, even though the wheel was chained. At the Institute it was stopped by Mr Hughey McGuire.

A Methodist Missionary Party will give meetings on 6 December in the Kooringa Methodist Church.

Rabbits. Never have they been as numerous as now. They can be seen in their thousands and in places there are heaps of dead rabbits piled up from weakness and poison. For miles along the eastern road the stench is almost unbearable. They are seen in droves towards Ketchowla and even in the town some fences have been the site for 100 to 300 to be killed in an hour or so.

XV, 654, 30 Nov. 1904, page 5

Accident. F.T. Jones brought into Burra yesterday, Arthur Abbott, aged c. 24 and a son-in-law of Mr C. Stasinowsky of Baldina. Abbott had suffered concussion while riding a bicycle from Mr Jones’s house to his hut, a distance of some 34 miles, with a load of about 20 lb of mutton. The accident happened on Monday and he lay near the road on Tuesday morning and was unnoticed by a passing teamster before being seen by Mr Jones’ men. His case is considered very serious.

Ketchowla Station held anniversary services last Sunday and Monday and on Monday there were games followed by the tea meeting.

Douglas Methodist Church held its anniversary on 20 November with the tea meeting on 23 November, preceded by a game of cricket. J. Kellock, the treasurer, reported that £24 had been paid off the debt which now stood at £6 and there is sufficient already in hand to pay this off when it falls due on 30 September next. A men’s working bee will soon erect a new fence around the property.

Cricket has started again – subscription 5/- - opening match at Victoria Park next Saturday will be Married v. Single. Last Wednesday Burra 128 defeated Mongolata 78 at Douglas.

Obituary. William Lambert, formerly of Burra, but who went to Broken Hill some years ago with his parents, was killed when he fell down a 60’ chute at the British Mine at Broken Hill on Saturday morning. The deceased’s mother is a sister to Mrs Albert Brandt of Kooringa.

Marriage. Miss Leighton married Mr Reynolds at Booborowie last week.

Accident. A young son of Mr A. Fuss of Aberdeen (aged 31⁄2), narrowly escaped death on Monday morning in the workshop when a piece of 11⁄2” x 9’ timber fell from above and hit his left foot. One toe was severed and another had to be amputated. He is getting on satisfactorily.

[This would be Norman C. Fuss, born 1901.]

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. Work continues, but nothing much of note has happened. The shaft near St Mary’s is down to 23’, but there is no real indication of copper. The going is hard.

Accident. Mr Thomas Turner of Hampton was pinned to the ground under his cart on the Mt Bryan Rd when his horse shied and ran into the fence. An engine driver gave the alarm. Neither Mr Turner nor the horse was seriously hurt.

Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting, Institute on Thursday last.

E.W. Crewes took the chair.

The Mayor’s Report.

The financial year has been changed which makes this one of only 11 months. It began with a credit of £54-10-0 and now is in credit £92-1-10 (partly due to the shorter year).

The Ward accounts are then printed.

Income for the year from all sources was £520-18-2 and from rates was £312-6-101⁄2.

Salaries: Town Clerk £49-3-4, Inspector £33-6-8, Mayor’s allowance £15.

Unusual expenditure this year was £40-12-3 on lighting, but this included capital cost of the ‘Best Lights’ which when well maintained will not exceed the cost of the antiquated kerosene lamps and give a much better light.

There is still room here for extension.

The main road grant was £273, of which £269-19-5 has been expended and the main roads are now in good order.

The cemetery has been improved and more can be done given that the present balance is £53-2-11.

Three small reserves adjacent have been granted to the Corporation by SAMA and while obtaining title to these steps have been made to bring it all under the RPA.

Health.

Apart from a small outbreak of scarlatina the town’s health has been good this year. The question of a public slaughterhouse has been discussed, but was again passed over this year.

The Waterworks.

It is to be hoped that this will be its last appearance in a Mayor’s Report. Early in the year Council realised the appalling state of the Waterworks and that continuation of existing arrangements necessitated very great expenditure to be borne by the ratepayers. A deputation asked for such concessions from the Commissioner of Public Works as would enable the Council to carry on without imposing an undue burden. The Commissioner refused such concessions in any way. Council than considered handing over the works as soon as possible to the Government. The Government’s terms for a handover were obtained and Council was unanimous in accepting the same. A ratepayers’ meeting received this recommendation and adopted it without dissent. After further clarification of some points of detail the transfer to the Government was effected. The amount of work done since to the whole system should convince anyone that it was the correct move and that we are much more likely to obtain a good supply of better water than was probable under Council control.

Thanks were expressed to the whole of Council and to the town Clerk, Mr Bartholomaeus and sympathy expressed for the latter’s recent bereavement.

Dr Sangster asked if the meat slaughtered outside the Corporation was inspected previous to being sold. The answer was ‘No’.

Mr Lott enquired about arrangements between the District Council and the Corporation.

[Though the paper says between the Corporation and Burra Town Council which was the same thing.]

The Mayor said arrangements had been discussed, but nothing definite agreed.

At present two butchers killed within the corporation and two outside it.

The Act relating to butchering and meat inspection would soon be amended and he hoped the difficulties would then be overcome. It was ridiculous to expect the District Council to spend their money inspecting meat to be sold in the town.

The Mayor was glad to see the tar-dressing of footpaths had proceeded.

Cr Snell thanked those ratepayers in East Ward who had placed him at the head of the poll.

Candidates then addressed the meeting.

Cr Snell was glad that the Waterworks had gone. He desired and was hopeful of seeing a better quality water supply as a result. He favoured the Government spending £24,000 at Black Waterholes for a supply from a holding dam. He was in favour of the ‘Best Lights’. From 1 December the Council would find the oil and the contractor would merely attend to the lighting. He advocated more tar-dressing of footpaths with some more kerbing and tree planting.

Mr Hardy claimed he had come forward because Cr Snell had told him he was sick and tired of the job. He thought the rubbish depot needed to be shifted as windy days brought papers and germs down around the hospital. He was not in favour of the ‘Best Lamps’, bur preferred acetylene gas lights and he favoured them on Henderson’s Bridge, Market Square, and the Mine Bridge. The three Wards should share the cost of any work on the Cemetery Rd. All meat should be inspected and they should agitate for better water.

Cr West favoured tar-dressing, kerbing and tree planting.

Dr Sangster asked Mr Snell if he was sick and tired of Council and Cr Snell assured them that he had never said any such thing.

Hardy re-asserted his original statement.

XV, 655, 7 Dec. 1904, page 3

Storm. Wind on Monday morning lifted the roof from the back room of a cottage in Paxton Square on Kingston St and dropped it on the footpath, narrowly missing two little girls.

XV, 655, 7 Dec. 1904, page 4

Editorial on Things Municipal.

The slaughterhouse question is the major issue to be resolved. Until the Act is amended the whole question will remain unresolved. Finance is the next problem. The sanitary state of the town is satisfactory. Some better lighting is desirable. Some further tree planting is required. If we had an increasing instead of a decreasing population we would have more money to command for works.

Baldina School celebrated their annual picnic last Thursday.

Burra Jubilee Benevolent Society has received £1 from Mr J. Collins of Collinsville. 50 orders were granted for the month, including firewood and Christmas cheer.

Municipal Election: East Ward.

W.H. Hardy campaigned vigorously. Mr Snell did not. 93 votes were recorded: 56 for Mr Snell and 37 for Mr Hardy. Mr Snell in thanking voters made reference to the yarns circulated about him, but which had evidently not deterred voters.

Mr Hardy in seconding the vote of thanks to the returning officer made veiled references to some ‘outside work’. When called upon to explain his reference he declined. He said he had ‘heard things said about me which I will deal with later’.

Another item in the paper refers to placards reading ‘Vote for W.H. Hardy, the live candidate.’ This seems to have induced some people not to vote as they drew the implication that Snell was dead.

Arthur Abbott, who was badly injured in a fall from his bike last week seems to have wandered about dazed before being found and was on his hands and knees when Villis found him. The odd thing is that when he left Mr Jones’s on his bike he had 20 lb of mutton, a Bayard rifle and a bottle of strychnine. The bike was found with a broken fork, but no trace of a portion of the rifle or the strychnine has been found.

Weather. Monday was hot and dusty with strong wind [see page 3 item]. Birds were found dead in large numbers. A cool change arrived in the evening.

Cricket: last Saturday at Victoria Park. Married Men 157 defeated Single Men 106.

The club will meet next Friday at the Institute for the election of officers. It is proposed to divide the club into two teams to keep members in practice when not playing teams from outside.

XV, 655, 7 Dec. 1904, page 5

Lawn Tennis. On Wednesday 30 November 6 ladies and 6 gentlemen went to Terowie for a match. Terowie 13-114 defeated Burra 6-92.

[Personal interest: there are references to a Miss Fuss and a Miss M. Fuss. Miss Fuss was probably the elder and therefore Muriel which would make Miss M. stand for Myrtle.]

On 3 December at Aberdeen: Aberdeen 6-40 defeated Kooringa 2-29.

Arthur Abbott remains in hospital as a serious case.

W.J. Richards is recovering from his bicycle accident, but can only just get around and may well yet lose most if not all his teeth.

Mr M. Linkson intends to proceed to Broken Hill to live in about three weeks. He has long been an active member of Court Unity AOF.

The Dressmaking Class has given Mrs H. McCallum an elegant silver teapot as a thank you for her four years of service, together with a letter of thanks. Mr McCallum has now removed to WA.

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. The sample ore sent away has been subject to several experiments, but as yet no satisfactory way of treating it has been discovered.

The ‘Great Missionary Party’ arrived yesterday afternoon at the Kooringa Methodist Church. It included Ratu Niko Rabuku, a Fijian Chief and Mayor of Na-mata; Rev. Daniel Lotu, a Fijian; Dr George Brown, a veteran Pacific missionary; Rev. W. Jeffries, President of the SA Conference; and Rev. W.H. Hanton, Chairman of the Middle District. The evening meeting continues as we print.

XV, 655, 7 Dec. 1904, page 6

Baldina School Picnic. There are about 2 columns of detail on the picnic which was held about 7 miles east of Burra in John Roger’s paddock. Most of the item deals with the sports held, but there is the following reference to the school:

‘The building where the school is conducted is constructed of stone, just along side the Baldina Road and before it was erected a galvanised-room known as ‘Tin Chapel’ served as a place to teach the young.’

[The ‘Tin Chapel’ was the Baldina Church: also known as the ‘Tin Pot Chapel/Church’ and when it was rebuilt in stone it was suggested it be called the ‘Stone Jug Church’.]

## XV, 656, 14 Dec. 1904, page 3

Rabbits

An all-out attack by trapping, poison etc. has been made and numbers have been much reduced by the simultaneous attack. It is estimated 30,000 have been killed in a week to the east and reports vary from 300 to 5,000 killed in a single night by various people. In some places the stench now from dead rabbits is unbelievable. Phosphorus has been widely used. In places the bodies have been strung on fences and on some estates there are heaps of dead rabbits every few yards.

The rabbits have been migrating westwards as shown by one landowner who poisoned along a stretch of wire netting fence: the first night he caught 100, the second 200, the third 80 and the fourth 2,500. The absence of rain is helping in their destruction.

At the latter end of last week Mr Dearlove sent to Burra Railway Station 18,000 rabbit skins weighing almost one ton from Ketchowla. He has captured up to 3,500 in a single night.

## XV, 656, 14 Dec. 1904, page 4

A Foolish Act. A resident last week wondered what a poisoned twig tasted like. He licked a strychnine laced twig and immediately experienced a coking sensation. On hastily drinking some water he vomited and he is recovering after being given a further emetic.

Burra District Council is offering a reward of £3 for conviction of those caught depositing dead rabbits along main roads.

A ram is charging people on Mitchell’s Flat and a small girl fell victim on Saturday. Mrs Brandt was knocked down on Monday. If the owner does not remove the animal the inspector will have to intervene in the interests of public safety.

Court Pride of Burra held a successful picnic at Johnson’s Creek on Wednesday. A year ago there were 25 members and today there are 65.

W.J. Davey & Carlo will repeat their performance on Saturday at 2 p.m.

Kooringa Methodist Church was crowded on Tuesday on both the floor and gallery for the special missionary meeting with the President of Conference and Dr Brown and his Missionary Party. There was a well-attended meeting in the afternoon. Revs W. Jeffries, W.H. Hanton & Dr Brown took part, but the piece de resistance was a delightful address by Rev. Daniel Lotu of Fiji. The collection was £1-8-0.

The evening meeting started at 7.30 and went to 10-20. Dr Brown spoke for 60 minutes and then Ratu Niku Rabuka (the Fijian Chief) Stipendiary Magistrate & Mayor of Na Mata gave an address, followed by Rev. D. Lotu.

Farmers & Producers’ Political Union met in the Institute on Friday. President F. Duldig took the chair. The platform drawn up by the sub-committee was passed.

A big revival in cricket is anticipated for this season.

Cricket. Saturday at Victoria Park: Stockbreeders 168 and Burra 5 for 287.

E. Diplock writes re the Burra Mine. The directors have their eyes closed. He is sure there is plenty of good ore at the 50 fathom level and many untouched lodes.

Thomas Best writes to correct Dr Sangster’s writing about the Burra Mine in the Register. The engine started in 1854 was Gender’s and not Morphett’s, which only came to Burra in 1859. He remembers passing Mr Woollacott’s teams a mile or so the other side of Smithfield while on the way to Pt Adelaide with a load of copper. The big wagon had the ‘bob’ of the engine on board and it was drawn by the largest team of bullocks probably ever seen in Australia: 42 or 44 arranged four abreast with two leaders. All bridges on the way had to be propped including the small one this side of Hamilton. Like Dr Sangster Best felt it was time something definite was done before all the shareholders’ money was dribbled away with nothing to show.

‘T.B.’ writes calling on Burra to get a band together for occasions like the sports day – even a fife and drum band would be better than nothing. ‘Sports are not much without a band.’

Court.

William Edgar Jordan was fined 2/6 + fees to total £1-11-6 for a stray red cow in Market Square.

John D. Rowett of Marrabel incurred fines and costs of £8-2-0 for breaches of the Stock Diseases Act by travelling through Hundred of King without giving due notice.

James Loudan, popular manager of Booborowie Estate, is seriously ill.

William Pearce, former blacksmith and wheelwright of Commercial St, is visiting Burra after four year’s absence. He is in business for himself as a wheelwright in Kalgoorlie WA, but on returning to WA he may take up land, as the WA Government is offering incentives for people to do so.

Mr Mark Linkson was farewelled at Court Unity on Friday. He intends to move to Broken Hill.

Kooringa Methodist Church will hold Hospital Sunday next Sunday. The Kooringa & Aberdeen Oddfellows Lodges, the Foresters, The Rechabites, members of the Town & District Councils and the Hospital Board will form a procession from the Institute to the Church. The service will be conducted by Revs T.B. Angwin & J. Allen. The Burra Orchestra will be present in full strength.

Pleasant Entertainment at the Kooringa Methodist Lecture Hall on Wednesday evening to raise money for a picnic tent. There was a satisfactory result and another such should see the sum needed obtained.

Burra district Council calls a meeting of ratepayers at the Institute next Saturday to consider the advisability of erecting a vermin-proof fence between the Hundreds of Baldina and King.

W.J. Davey’s performance of ‘Merry Moment’ with his dog Carlo at the matinee on Saturday in the Institute went off very well with great merriment.

An Aggressive Ram that had been annoying residents of Mitchell’s Flat has been placed in the Copperhouse Pound and will be sold on the 2 January if unclaimed. It demolished the gate on being placed there, but once a ‘miniature Port Arthur’ was established, he was contained.

Rabbits continue in plague proportions, though being actively slaughtered. Mr J. Pick of Braemar has been taking up to 3,376 in a single night and has disposed of between 15,000 and 16,000 recently.

Charles Kickebusche of World’s End had a narrow escape when working on a windmill with his brother, Julius. A whirlwind frightened the horse which took off. Julius held on to the reins and was dragged a considerable distance. When Charles went to assist he fell and the dray’s wheel grazed his head and passed over his arm near the shoulder. Amazingly, though very painful, it was not broken and is improving under the care of Dr Sangster.

Hospital Sunday was held last Sunday at the Kooringa Methodist Church. A large congregation assembled with the members of the Lodges, the Hospital board, the Town Council and the District Council. The Burra Orchestra played and £6-10-0 was raised.

Burra United friendly Societies’ Sports will be held as usual on Boxing Day.

Weather recently has been dry and good for harvesting, but rain fell on Saturday when over 0.5” was recorded. Though good for domestic supplies it will encourage the rabbits which have been in decline.

Burra School broke up on Friday, before which a concert was held in the large room and 18/1 was raised for the Burra Hospital.

W.J. Richards has almost recovered from his bicycle accident.

Miss Hughes, the Baldina school teacher, left Burra for Blyth on her bicycle on Friday evening.

Tennis. On Saturday at Aberdeen Redruth 5-38 defeated Aberdeen 3-32.

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. Work continues, but without any spectacular results. The main effort is in the shaft near Peacock’s Air Shaft and the surrounding area looks like a mine in miniature with winding ropes, horse path, stampers, washers, ore heaps, windlass, buckets and sorting house. The shaft near St Mary’s has again been abandoned. On the old ore beds are five heaps of ore from tributers – some not doing very well – there being too much dead work.

George Highet was found guilty of sheep stealing at Orroroo on Monday, but was released under the First Offenders Protection Act. He left Burra a week ago on a horse hired from Alex. Harris and saddle etc. from J.C. Sandland. He is now believed to be on his way back to Burra.

Burra Electro-Magnetic Separation Works are looking very forlorn. Some parts have been removed. Some coal remains. The railway lines etc. are being taken up. So far only the ‘dryer’ has gone to Broken Hill, though there was talk of other machinery doing so too.

A Burra Amusement Club has been formed to meet fortnightly in St Mary’s Schoolroom to provide sociable and profitable evenings for young men. E. F. Lockyer is the general manager. G.E. Dane is musical director, Mr Hague is stage manager, Mr S.M. Lane is secretary and C. Pearce is treasurer. A musical evening was held on 13 December.

Booborowie Sports will not be held this year. (As a token of sympathy for Mr Loudon, Manager of Booborowie Station in his present lamentable illness – according to a note on page 4.)

Arthur Abbott has left hospital.

Court.

James Gully was fined 5/- for failing to send his daughter, Martha, to school as required.

John Penns and Frank Ford were each fined 2/6 for similar offences. (Less as it was their first offence.)

## Burra Town Council

W.J. Richards, via his lawyer, is seeking £50 damages for the cycle accident recently, when he says a council workman left a culvert uncovered, resulting in Richardson’s severe injuries. Council will seek legal advice and act accordingly.

Characteristics of the paper in 1904

1. The original format. (January to September)

Page 1. Larger advertisements, mostly not local.

Page 2. Larger advertisements and a very few ‘classified’ advertisements. Generally no editorials and then shortish news paragraphs interspersed with similar looking text that advertises patent medicines etc.

Page 3. Continuation of page 2 in style. A jumble of news items and advertisements, plus a serial and some jokes or other light material.

Page 4. Large advertisements dominated by patent medicines like Seigel’s Syrup, Beecham’s Pills, Vitadatio, with two columns of self-advertising.

2. The new format. (From October)

Page 1. Business directory of the town and large advertisements, largely not local.

Page 2. 1 column of the Town Directory and then local advertising.

Page 3. News mixed with various advertising, including some patent medicines.

Page 4. 1column of self-advertisement, an Editorial, and then mostly local news.

Page 5. More local news, a few advertisements, regional reports.

Page 6. Articles on such topics as poultry farming, women’s interests, with a few advertisements and news paragraphs.

Page 7. Large advertisements: a mixture of local and others.

Page 8. As for page 7.

In some issues jokes were used as a filler on pages 5 & 6.

Generally speaking the paper seemed rather tired and without any depth of reporting in the first half of the year. The local businesses seem to have almost stopped advertising in it. From 15 June there was an attempt to revitalise the paper. There were editorials on a regular basis for the first time in years. These were not however, especially penetrating or mind stretching and can in no way compare with either the wide-ranging editorials of Holder’s time or with the quite incisive local comments from the early years of Davey’s period. Much more local news appeared and there was more attention to detail. There were interesting snippets on present and past Burra identities. There were household hints and suggestions of interest to the housewife, the farmer and the poultry keeper for example. There were also quirky items and humorous segments. The increasing length of the notes from the middle of the year is indicative of this change.

When the new format appeared there was an immediate lift in local advertising and the improvement in the quality and range of local news was maintained.

Numbering of issues in 1904

Volume XV continued for the whole year, having started 7 December 1892.

The year began with Volume XV Number 607 on 6 January 1904

And continued to Volume XV Number 657 on 21 December 1904

Court

James Gully was fined 5/- for failing to send his child Martha to school as required.

(This despite the information that Mr & Mrs Gully were separated and he was unsure where Martha was living.)

John Penns was fined 2/6 for failing to send his child Murray to school as required.

Frank Ford was fined 2/6 for failing to send a child to school as required.

Philip Nankivell was fined £1 + cost for trespassing on Crown Lands in the Hundred of Baldina without giving notice.

Johannes Gottfried Mann was charged with failure to kill rabbits on his land at Baldina. He gave evidence that he had killed 8,000 and had begun killing prior to receiving a notice to do so, had employed as many as four men and had sent away 451lb of rabbit skins. His son, T.A. Mann, also gave evidence and another son, L. Mann, said he had been working on the land all the time except for five days of illness and had killed 8,871 rabbits. The SM dismissed the case.

24 December

Alex Cobb was fined 5/- or 14 hrs for being drunk in Market Square on the night of 23 December.

Alex Cobb was fined £1 or 1 month for using indecent language.

Alex Cobb was fined £5 or 2 months for assaulting M-C Grosser.

Alex Cobb was charged with being idle and disorderly. C.C. Heinrich of the Burra Hotel gave evidence that Cobb had hung around deterring other customers from the hotel and had not left when asked to. Mrs Heinrich said he had threatened to smash up everything in the house. Heinrich admitted that Cobb had spent money in the hotel and that he had changed a number of pound notes for Cobb. Cobb thought Heinrich’s complaint was a bit much when he had spent over £40 at the hotel. Though he had only 1/6 on him when arrested, he now had £3 that had arrived from Melbourne the day before. The case was eventually dismissed.

26 December

Arthur Collins was fined 16/- for using indecent language in Market Square on Christmas Eve.

30 December.

Edgar Shepperd (23) was charged with having no visible means of support. He was sentenced to 2 months, but released under the First Offender’s Act provided he left town within half an hour. He left.

Obituary. Thomas Parks, aged 77, died 28 December 1904, at Kooringa.

Mr Parks arrived in SA in 1846 and after a time in Adelaide came to Burra in 1849 with his wife and two children. Here he worked for Messrs Roach and Roscow as a baker. He went to the Victorian diggings, but only for 8 or 9 weeks owing to ill health. He returned to Burra and took up baking on his own account, and then a greengrocery business in premises bow occupied by A. Bennetts. Though he had been ailing for some time, death came suddenly. He leaves five daughters: Mrs Dyer of Orroroo, Mrs Ware of Adelaide, Mrs T. Goldsworthy of Adelaide, Mrs A. Bennett of Burra and Mrs R.D. Pascoe of Burra. There are three sons: Thomas of Burra, George of Pt Pirie and Charles of Burra.

George Parks, who is working at the Pt Pirie Smelter, came back to Burra last week due to his father’s death.

Accident. Tom Gray’s horse and dray went over the edge of the culvert in the dark on the Baldina Rd near Ford’s. It was first thought the horse was killed. M-C Grosser and T.P. Halls investigated, but it was not possible to extricate the horse without extra help in the morning.

Marriage. On 27 Dec. Miss E. Villis, eldest daughter of Isaac Villis, married Richard John Rogers, second son of John Rogers of Baldina.

Fires. On Friday evening, just after the Broken Hill express passed, a fire broke out a little north of the long cutting towards Mt Bryan, in Mr Jos. Ford’s paddock. For a time the high flames were feared likely to reach Redruth, but the wind shifted and turned the fire towards Mt Bryan. In half an hour over 100 men were assembled to beat out the flames. Water was got to extinguish the fence posts for fear of burning sparks setting fire to Mr Gebhardt’s paddock. Stock was got out of Elder, Smith’s paddock before the fire got there.

A fire by the Waterworks shed on Saturday morning travelled west to Mr Elliott Camp’s enclosure and burnt 10 sets of fowls, harness and other items to the value of £80.

Several areas of grass were burnt close to the railway line near Mt Bryan last week.

Cricket. Just before the holidays the Tennis Players 164, defeated the Non-Tennis Players 61.

Wattle Blossom Fair last September left a surplus which was sold on 23 December in the Institute, and along with a concert and pasty supper, £9 was added to the fair’s funds.

Rabbits. A three day shooting excursion on J.C. Sandland’s property netted 400-500 rabbits with hares, snakes, possums, lizards etc.

Obituary. Mrs Gosden who lost two daughters some time ago, died at Burra Hospital last week.

[Janet Gosden died 1 January 1905 aged 45. Born Janet Colman. Wife of Alexander Gosden.]

Obituary. Mr J. Loudon of Booborowie died and the body was brought in yesterday and sent to Adelaide by rail. [James Loudon died 1 January 1905 at Booborowie Station.]

He was taken ill a few weeks ago with cancer of the neck and his body was sent to Burra on Tuesday. He was 61 and had been manager of Booborowie Sheep Station for over 20 years. He had been Chairman of the Booborowie DC for many years and took a great interest in all sports and lent the large shed willingly for anything likely to advance the interest of the young. He arrived in SA in the 1850s and went to work on his father’s station at Carrawirralo before accepting the position of manager at Booborowie Station.

Marriage. Today the marriage is announced of Miss Maud Nicholls, daughter of John Nicholls to Mr William Lomman, both of Copperhouse.

Miss Kate Cope of the Burra Hotel has had a tumour weighing 172 oz [4.87 kg] removed in Adelaide and after six weeks is back at work in the bar.

Miss Margaret Tobin was presented with a beautiful silver tea service for her work as organist at St Joseph’s for 12 or 13 years. She has now decided to relinquish the position.

Kooringa Methodist Sunday School picnic was held as usual on Monday at Sod Hut. It was a very successful outing.

## The weather has been extraordinarily hot. Thursday was hot, but Friday and Saturday reached 110°F in the shade and it continued hot on Sunday. Sparrows fell dead from the trees and fowls, geese and turkeys also died. On Sunday evening there was a thunderstorm with a few drops of rain. Churches had been practically deserted. Monday brought a delightfully cool day with 57 points of rain in the evening.

## XV, 658, 4 Jan. 1905, Page 5

## Christmas in Burra. The town streets were more crowded on Christmas Eve than for many years. Between 8 and 10 p.m. it was hard to pass on the footpaths and the main road also carried many hundreds of people. The children mostly carried a trumpet and the like and their sound was heard from one end of the street to the other. Though the hotels did good business there were no disturbances. Business did a good trade, some selling all they had on offer. Shop windows were decorated for the season. There was no band this year, but about 11 p.m. carol singers set out to serenade a number of citizens.

New Year’s Eve passed without any larrikinism at all in the town and even walls and shutters survived unmarked. But at Copperhouse a cart was placed in a wagon and several vehicles moved from their usual places. At 12 tins, guns and other noisy things were heard and in the street the anthem Hail to the Newborn King.

The Season. 1904 was one of the driest years on record with only 12.36”.

Accident. Mr & Mrs Thomas Reynolds were thrown from their buggy about 12 miles from Booborowie on their way home from Burra on Friday last and badly shaken. The horses eventually got free and the buggy was considerably damaged.

Cricket last Monday at Saddleworth: Burra 193 defeated Saddleworth 66.

Rainfall. The rainfall has extended to the east with falls of half an inch common and 125 points at King’s Well.

World’s End Races were successful on 2 January, in favourable weather. Results are printed.

Phosphate Rock has been discovered about 11⁄2 miles on the Burra side of the Fairview Claim. Samples go up to 631⁄2%, but demand for it is not high at present.

Farmers & Producers Union. A preliminary meeting was held at Bright at Mr Fetke’s on 26 December. Mr A. Ruediger presided and F. Duldig addressed the meeting. A branch will now be formed there.

Burra High School. The Concert, Break-up and Prize Giving was conducted by Miss Millar at St Mary’s Schoolroom on 23 December. She reported a larger roll call than ever before. Vera Fuss was the only student to never miss a school session in 1904, and Edith Bartholomaeus missed only 1⁄2 day. Results are printed. [Though it is not made explicit, the implication seems to be that Hazel Bartholomaeus was dux, though Edna Goode would have been in all likelihood, had she attended for more than six months.] Miss Roach leaves the staff at the end of 1904 to be replaced by Miss Vera Wilkinson. Miss Sangster will continue. The school picnic was at Gum Creek Station last Saturday, thanks to Mr & Mrs John Bowman. In winter the school bazaar raised £22-8-0 for the New Guinea Mission. The prize list is printed. [Vera Fuss getting the prize for attendance.]

## XV, 658, 4 Jan. 1905, Page 6

Thomas Sandland invited a shooting party to Koo-owie on 21 December, but the rabbits had been extensively poisoned and trapped, so only 187 were shot.

Burra United Friendly Societies’ Annual Sports were held on Boxing Day at Victoria Park. Gate takings were up on 1903 despite the latter part of the day being dusty. Major Marshal, an American Negro, was engaged to impress in the cycle races, but he was far from impressive and the money was not well-spent. The cycling and pedestrian races were the best for many years. The bike track has been improved, but needs considerably more work. It needs tar-dressing. Unfortunately many local spectators stayed away and the bulk of onlookers seemed to be strangers or neighbours. The changing tent near the tea tent was a mistake since ‘as a rule people prefer to have something besides blasphemy with a cup of tea’. There was no music of any kind this year. The events are then reported in over 2 columns.

Burra District Council. Ratepayers voted against a move to erect a vermin-proof fence between the Hundreds of King and Bright, at a meeting held in the Institute on 24 December.

## XV, 659, 11 Jan. 1905, Page 3

Inquest held at the Bon Accord Hotel on Wednesday afternoon, 4 January, into the fire at New Aberdeen on 31 December. Most of the witnesses were relatives of Government employees and seemed to be very reluctant to say anything that would confirm that the fire might have begun from sparks from the Waterworks chimney.

Miss Nellie Roach was very evasive, saying at one point:

‘I won’t say any more; I am only a woman and you can’t expect much from me I cannot speak like a man.’

When further instructed to answer she continued:

‘Oh I don’t want them; [i.e. the questions] I don’t like questions; I can’t stand them.’

Mr Winnall, who was appearing on behalf of Mr E. Camp, who had sustained £80 damages was clearly annoyed by this and said: ‘We will give you a chair then.’

[M-C Phelan then provided a chair, though whether Mr Winnall’s sarcasm was meant to be taken literally is unclear.]

Elliott Camp claimed he had traced the fire back to still burning chips and cinders close to the Waterworks shed.

The verdict was that there was strong circumstantial evidence that the fire started at New Aberdeen on 31 December, by a spark from the Burra Waterworks chimney.

The coroner was C. Bartholomaeus and C.A. Fuss was foreman of the jury.

Copper. Some nice copper was found some 35 miles east of Burra three years ago and a shaft was put down to 20-30 feet, but it missed the reef. Recently a stone from there was assayed at 29% copper with 51⁄2 dwt gold.

Burra Town Council, 4 January.

The main road grant for 1904 is £273.

A letter from W.A. Piper re Mr Richardson’s claim for damages as received.

General Rate fixed at 9d with Health Rate of 5d and Parklands Rate 1⁄2d in the £.

Salaries for the year: Town Clerk £70 and Secretary to local Board of Health £10.

Mr Geake to be notified his contract for lamp lighting terminates in one month.

Editorial on Mining. The depression of trade has the effect of driving people to new ventures and with copper now at £68-17-6 a ton it should spark interest in the Burra Mine. The depression has been more severe for the last seven years than ever before. Want of capital prevents developments in SA that would take place in Victoria or other states where the Governments also help more.

Aberdeen Quarry. Work was resumed at the quarry on Monday, but for how long is not known.

Duffer Dam. There is a petition to clean out this dam 25 miles east of Burra. It has a few feet of water in it, but it is more than half filled with silt.

Rabbit numbers have declined with the hot weather.

Fire. On 31 December a large fire on Koomooloo destroyed 4,000 to 5,000 acres of grass. Wax matches are believed to be responsible. The loss, though significant, was restricted to grass.

AOF, Court Unity & Court Pride of Burra report a satisfactory year with increased funds and membership.

Mr Camp has applied to the Waterworks authorities for some recompense for the fire.

Weather. The heat continues with temperature in the town at 89°F before 9 a.m., but to the east maxima between 100° and 120°F in the shade have been reported.

Harvest. The late harvest has been very patchy. Some farmers did well and others very poorly. Some with yields between 16 & 18 bushels per acre but others only got 1 bag per acre – due not only to patchy rain, but also to varying application of fertilizer. To the east few have even recovered seed wheat. A farmer at World’s End got 1 bag from a 150 acre paddock. [He is named as W. Prior on page 5.]

Obituary. Mrs A. Schuppan died 30 December 1904 at Emu Downs.

Cricket at Clare on Saturday: Clare 237 defeated Burra 200.

Hanson Bicentenary Methodist Church held its anniversary on 25 December with the tea meeting on 27 December. Over 300 were at the latter with 170 coming from Burra by train and 30 in vehicles. Proceeds were £13-12-0.

C. Thoroughgood left Burra for holiday in the south after six weeks as barman at the Burra Hotel.

Bob Stewart, overseer for W.P. Barker for 30 years, has left Baldina for Adelaide.

Miss Kate Cope, who has been barmaid at the Burra Hotel for six months, is moving to Broken Hill.

C.C Heinrich of the Burra Hotel has gone to Adelaide due to the illness there of his mother, aged 70. His father was a produce carter from Adelaide to Burra in the early days and once arrived in Burra with a load of flour, only to have it rushed and every bag taken as before his arrival flour was unobtainable. Next morning he received the full value of what had been taken.

Obituary. Mr Hatch, an early ore carter from Burra to Adelaide died in Nuriootpa last week.

[Joshua Hatch died 5 January 1905 aged 73.]

Miss E. Walker has started business as a dressmaker in Bridge St, near the old Bible Christian Church. [The location comes from a page 4 advertisement.]

The Record announces that the circulation has more than doubled. [Given the cut in price this would have been a requirement for success.]

Marriage. Miss Mary McCoy of Wandillah Station was married to Mr Patrick Hayes of Pt Augusta at Wandillah on 5 January by Father Redden. They will live at Pt Augusta.

Accident. A swagman, John Newton (35), injured his spine on Monday night when he jumped 16 or 17 feet from the Black Bridge. He had intended to sleep under the bridge and thought the drop was only a few feet. He was lucky to have missed the stones. He is likely to be in hospital for a considerable time.

Fire. The fire at Koomooloo on 31 December is reported. The grass was 2’ high in places and the fire travelled six miles from NW to SE and burned from midday to 1 a.m. the following day. In places it was 3 miles wide and consumed 4,000 to 5,000 acres. Luck saved Mr Warnes’s stud rams which had only just been moved from the paddock. A wind change saved the properties of Messrs McWaters and Sandland. Wax vestas dropped by rabbiters are suspected of causing the fire.

Market Square Pump has been kept busy supplying water to the thirsty in the recent heat wave.

The Second Heat Wave for the year has played havoc with stock, poultry and fruit gardens. Figs, plums and other stone fruit have been scorched and fallen. Many birds have died. In town the temperature ranged from 98°f to 112°F and for three days averaged 102°F. Thunderstorms and a very little rain on Saturday afternoon brought some relief.

Mr James Bennetts celebrated 50 years as a local preacher at Broken Hill recently. He came to Adelaide in 1854 and rode a bullock dray to Burra where he was associated with Dr W.G. Torr in the Sunday school. He then went to Moonta Mines and 17 years ago to Broken Hill. He first preached in Burra.

Mr Newton’s accident last week at the Black Bridge highlights the need for a lamp there. The celebrated arc light does not reach that far.

Burra Town Council has been advised by Mr Piper that it is free from any liability for Mr Richard’s accident. It will now be decided in court unless arrangements are made beforehand.

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. There is no great news, though work continues slowly and with fewer hands than before Christmas. No official report is yet to hand about the bulk sample.

The Eastern Country is looking quite good and while temperatures have reached 112° to 116°F last week, there was also extensive but patchy rain. Falls ranged from 25 points at Woolgangi to 50 points at Perran Vale and 125 points at King’s Well and 200 points at Black Hills.

The Malachite Reef that wasn’t. On 9 January John Macklvie, an old man, arrived at the Commercial Hotel, had a good meal and a good drink and then produced some samples of malachite which he claimed to have found on Princess Royal. For some time he was well supplied with drinking friends as he retold the story of its discovery. Though shouted a good many drinks he carefully avoided saying where the find was precisely located. He talked his way into a bed for the night and after that a hearty breakfast. He was invited to dinner at a prominent resident’s and of course he accepted and ate well. After this a party was formed to go to the reef on Princess Royal. Once out there he managed to leave the group for a few moments and then to disappear without trace. A search was made for him, but to no avail. The whole thing was a hoax and it is suggested that it started as a bet that such a trick could not be pulled off.

Court.

Charm Singh, an Indian Sikh, sued Hulda Stenberg to recover £15-5-2, being money lent on the undertaking of a promise of marriage which the girl had later thought better of. After much evidence Mr Singh was awarded £15-5-0. (The couple came from Booborowie.)

John Newcomb, aged 13, was sent to the Brooklyn Park Reformatory for stealing food from a bag on the platform at Farrell’s Flat on 18 January. He is an orphan who had been sent from the Industrial School to work at Clare, but did not like the position. The editor conjectures that he is the son of John Newcomb who was some time ago a Burra resident and pursued many occupations including pretending to be a solicitor in the town.

Obituary. John Jenkin died at his residence in Ayers St on Friday 27 January on his 73rd birthday. For over 23 years he was an employee of the Town Council and prepared nearly all the town’s roads and footpaths. He assisted in the last survey of the town. He was often appealed to, even of recent days when he was almost blind, to find survey pegs around the town. He was a long time member of the Burra Lodge and passed through all the chairs. He was born at Panzibella, Cornwall in January 1832 and Mrs Jenkin was born at Redruth, Cornwall in February 1828. He arrived at Pt Adelaide on 27 July 1851 on the Omega. They were married at St Mary’s Burra on 10 February 1852 by Rev. James Politt. He visited the Victorian Goldfields and worked for a number of years in the Burra Mine. There are five daughters:

Mrs J. Barratt, Mrs W.G.F. Batchelor (Hindmarsh), Mrs W. Geake (Burra), Mrs B.T.B. Hancock (Petersburg), Miss E.L. Jenkin (Burra), and 10 grandchildren. [Born 27 January 1832.]

Public Meeting. In response to public demand the Mayor has called a meeting on Friday at the Institute to consider the Burra Mine.

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. There are many rumours circulating. It is said:

Directors have decided to pump the water from the open cut.

A decision has been made to erect machinery to treat the ore.

That men will be put on to ascertain the quantity of ore in sight.

The pumping it is said will be done by a man who guarantees to drain the mine in less than six weeks with machinery left there for continuous use. An old miner tells us that when the mine closed hundreds of tons of blue carbonates were in the site and could be found again if the water were lowered. Even recent tributers have found good ore below water level, but have had to abandon further work due to the inrush of water. On Saturday the directors intend to visit the mine to inspect shafts etc. before deciding on the best steps to take.

Gold. Good reports continue to come in about the discovery east of Burra. A meeting of the syndicate will be held at the Record office at 8 o’clock Saturday evening when plans for future working will be considered.

Editorial on The Burra Mine and the Burra Burra Copper Co.

We now know that restarting the mine is as far off as ever. After 3 years 4 months of waiting for news the directors have not enough capital for the erection of the machinery to pump out the mine or to treat the ore. The money already spent will thus be lost. ‘Burra is rapidly going down.’

‘There is, we believe, more copper in the Burra Mine than has ever been taken out of it.’

Only capital is required.

Other towns have been assisted financially while Burra has never had a subsidy from the Government for mining purposes. All we want now is to borrow machinery lying idle – costs to be repaid, as they certainly could be – when the ore bodies below water level are struck. The townspeople showed at the meeting that they are unanimous in the view that Government should render some assistance at this critical time. The directors would carry on with a concentrating plant if the mine were dewatered.

Gold. The gold syndicate met on Saturday at the Record office and decided to send men out prospecting at once. [On page 5 it is named as The Eastern Gold & Copper Prospecting Syndicate.]

Fire. Mr Hardy in Kangaroo St had a fire in the house on Wednesday which threatened the building. Furniture was hastily removed, but the fire was extinguished before much damage was done.

Burra Racing Club has not held a meeting for 5 years and though the last meeting was a success the interest the next year was so slight that no meeting of members was called. Now with interest rising in northern towns a meeting of supporters is called for next Wednesday. A meeting could be arranged for April. The old club has a satisfactory bank account so the movement would not start from scratch.

Burra Mine. (Article from the Bulletin.) So far prospecting in and around the Burra Mine has not given much encouragement. The best prospects are from 8,000-10,000 tons of stuff above the water level. A trial lot has been sent to Wallaroo and if it proves worthwhile a small mill will be set up and the scrapings will be put through. Altogether SA mining is deadly dull. Apart from the Wallaroo and Moonta mines there is only the Yorke Peninsula salt industry from which last year’s output was c. 40,000 tons. It mainly employs seasonally unemployed farmers.

He worked briefly in Adelaide and Gawler before coming to Burra District where he worked nearly 20 years for Doctors W. & John Browne at Booborowie and in 1874 bought the business of H. Woodgate at New Aberdeen: chaff cutter. But he soon moved to Kooringa, buying the business of W.H. Banks, where the Burra Hotel stables now stand. About 12 months ago he broke a leg and now gets about with sticks. Three children are living: Mrs A.G. Muller (Broken Hill), Mrs R. Webber (Mt Bryan East), and Fred.

Public Meeting re Burra Mine, at the Institute last Friday.

The report on the move to approach the Government to lend a pumping plant to unwater the mine fills most of the page, but ends abruptly in mid sentence.

A large and representative body of residents met to consider approaching the Government with the view of asking them to lend a pumping plant to the Burra Burra Copper Co. to unwater the open cut. The Mayor, Mr J. Winnall, said it was a question that would affect all SA, not just Burra. He hoped the result of the meeting would be a step towards the resumption of active operations at the mine.

Mr E.W. Crewes said he hoped the steps to be taken would result in thousands being employed. They had not met to tear the directors to pieces. He believed they had done everything possible under the circumstances. In three years four months since the mine was refloated as a company he had expected great things. In his imagination he saw thousands of miners wending their way home and old buildings in the town torn down to be replaced by new and the old houses in the square give way to new shops. But none of this had happened. The results from the 100 tons sent to Wallaroo were satisfactory, but the directors now said that the expense of a pumping plant and new machinery was beyond them. All they can do is to go on prospecting in the hope of finding a rich lode that would assist them financially.

One day he and Dr Sangster were talking and they decided they had to get to the bottom of it all. [That is the apparent inaction by the directors.] They decided to go to Adelaide and see the directors. The directors said the enormous expense of raising the ore prevented them from proceeding as they would like. They did not want merely to raise ore, but to treat it before sending it away so that the town would get as much benefit as possible. They explained that the erection of machinery was stalled for lack of capital. If a sufficient new ore body could be exposed to view they were sure that Adelaide investors would come forward.

Crewes said the company had £3,000 at present and they could not let it just dribble away. He thought the only way forward was to ask the Government to assist by lending a plant to unwater the mine. The mine had saved SA in the past and had never received any subsidy and was entitled to some consideration now. The whole of the state would benefit from the restarting of the mine. Some of our best families are leaving us on account of the scarcity of work and others will go if something does not turn up directly. The Government has assisted other mining companies and they should therefore help Burra. He moved a motion that it was desirable the Government be asked to assist by supplying a pumping plant and unwatering the mine, thus opening up a large field for the employment of labour and advancing the prosperity of the district and the state. Dr Sangster seconded the motion which was carried.

Dr Sangster said he considered the meeting the most important in the town for many years, as it could waft back prosperity or leave the town as it was then. He was anxious for a policy of progress. He said he had lived in Burra for a quarter of a century, reared a family there and hoped to see out his working life there. Everyone should take an active interest in the progress of the town. He endorsed Mr Crewes’ remarks and said that after they had heard the directors’ remarks they had decided to return to the town and report to the people. If something was not done soon all the capital would be gone and they would be worse off than they were at the present time. If the Government came to the party with a pump the directors had £3,000 to spend on erecting machinery. The shareholders would not respond to a call until something more was being done than at present. Those who have known Burra for 25 years know what it has been and a reflection on the last ten years shows them to have been a series of failures in many ways. Families have moved away. Young men are leaving: since Christmas over 30 have gone either to Broken Hill or WA. Business has been hampered: it has had to extend credit, some of it for all time. If we do not shake ourselves further decline will follow. Other places have received assistance. Why not Burra?

He said he hoped a strong deputation would be appointed to influence the Government at lend the plant asked for.

Mr Winnall said before the mine was refloated the Government had lent a drilling plant to the company and at that time the Government Geologist, Mr Brown, said as a result he recommended opening up Morphett’s Shaft and going on with work. This made it likely the Government would come to the rescue.

Mr J. Drew said he had taken great interest in the Burra Mine. He said most of the profit for the old mine had come from above the water level. The sulphide lodes can be traced in several shafts for some 400yds. They had, he believed, a good claim on Government aid, not having previously asked for a penny. They would not be risking much - £1,000 to £1,200 would cover all they were asking for. All they wanted was to lower the water to the 300ft level. There was enough ore to employ 1,000 men and Burra would regain its prosperity.

Captain Pryor said he had faith in the mine and thought it well worth testing and he believed it would reveal a greater body of ore than hitherto unearthed. The old mine had not been developed systematically. We must go down he said. There was 9,000 to 10,000 tons of ore in sight and he believed much more would be exposed below water level. He believed approaching the Government was a reasonable proposition. The district was fast becoming depopulated.

[The report breaks off, but a deputation was evidently appointed to give effect to the motion that was passed.]

Editorial on the Government response to the request for aid for the Burra Mine.

The Government also believes the mine is worth developing. The deputation was well received and it remains now to see if the directors will do their part. They are bound to spend a certain sum of money. The first thing they will do is to unwater the mine and inspect the whole property. We believe large bodies of ore will be exposed, sufficient to encourage the directors to go on in earnest. The restarting of the mine will be the town’s salvation. It is pitiful to see the number of houses, once spick and span, now going to ruin. It is to be hoped that no time will be lost in erecting the pumping plant. The concentrating plant will, we understand, not be started till the mine is unwatered.

The Deputation to the Government concerning aid for unwatering the mine met the Hon. J. Vardon, Minister of Mines, on Thursday. The Mayor presented the case as outlined at the recent public meeting. Dr Sangster & E.W. Crewes also spoke. The Minister said before the Government did anything final in the matter they would need some representation from the directors as to the money they had spent, what they had on hand and what they were prepared to do in the future if the Government came to assistance. The Government would need some guarantee there would be no outlay [by them] of capital.

There was a suitable plant at Sliding Rock Mine which they might be willing to lend for some small consideration. Estimates of unwatering the mine varied from £6,000 to £10,000.

The Mine. Since the meeting of 17 February the town is hopeful of some development of the mine. So far the ‘imaginings’ of various people have been fruitful and now the imagining the Government would lend a pump has been fruitful. We are now ‘imagining future developments in the mine’ [The article continues on page 3.]

There are those who will say what’s the use – the game is not worth the candle. It is expected the pumping plant will be sent as soon as possible. The Government has agreed to deliver it to Burra Railway Station free of charge.

James Miller writes re the mine. He says he was an engineer for the Burra Mines for some years before it closed and the pumps were his department. He assumes the estimates of £6,000 to £10,000 to drain it are based on old pumping methods. He advocates abandoning the old mechanisms and going for the pneumatic principle. His method could be executed and fixed for considerably under £2,000.

Obituary. The death is announced of the SA novelist Guy Boothby, aged 38. [Born at Glen Osmond SA, 13 Oct. 1867, died Bournemouth UK, 26 Feb. 1905. He was noted for quantity rather than quality and produced 50 books in hard back, being a mixture of short stories and novels. There were also works published only in magazine format. The stories are mainly sensational adventures with a romantic storyline and a touch of the Gothic. Unlike some other prolific writers, they are not written to a formula, and vary considerable in their structure, and fit only roughly into genres like thrillers, romances and detective stories. He had a fascination for the bizarre with deformed and otherwise unusual characters.]

Fire. Mr Lowman of Mt Bryan, lost a haystack to fire last week. When M-C Phelan investigated he found scores of pieced of pollard laced with strychnine. Lowman lost turkeys, geese, fowls, ducks, cats and dogs. Strychnine was found in an outhouse. The careless way the baits were prepared has led to the conclusion it was children. The loss of the hay stack has not been explained and it was counted on by the owner to get him through the season.

Accident. On Wednesday a wagon loaded with several tons of wire and drawn by a bullock team was crossing the railway line near Hillside about 3 miles north of Burra and going too near the edge of the formation, the front wheels sank. A train was due, but there was nothing to be done, but wait for help. A party on the way to Mt Bryan Sports appeared and W. Truscott & Charles Pearce ran along the line to try and stop the approaching train. Those left behind tried to shift the wagon. The train was met half a mile down the track and the driver slowed down. In the meantime Messrs S. Lane & P. Gottschalk induced the animals to give a long pull and managed to clear the line. The driver was Mr Jones. [Check train or bullock driver?]

Redruth Methodist Circuit

The Methodist Conference has appointed Rev. R.C. Yeoman to the circuit and concern is being expressed over this. Rev. Yeoman was here about 12 years ago before Methodist Union and he is looked upon as a very capable preacher and a diligent worker, but he is 60 and cannot be expected to do the work of a young man in a circuit that comprises Redruth, Westbury, Ironmine, Booborowie and Hanson. The circuit has expressed its dissatisfaction while having nothing against Rev. Yeoman. They have been unfortunate in that the almost continuous illness of Rev. J. Allen in the past year has resulted in double expense.

Mr [Peter] Pascoe, who has been sought by the police for some months in relation to a stolen cheque and horse etc. from Mr W. Phin of Ironmine, has finally been apprehended at Echunga. He will appear in Redruth Court today.

The road beyond Nackra was in a terrible state, being full of rabbit burrows. The return trip beginning at midday on Saturday also took 121⁄2 hours. Mr Baynes says he is unlikely to repeat the experience. The running cost for the return trip was 3/-.

Redruth Court.

R. Giles, clerk at the court, has come across a couple of wine bottles which apparently were evidence in the case of a sale of wine to an Aboriginal. It bears the label: ‘This bottle contains part of wine sold by Mrs _____ (we omit the name) to Paddy Richardson, aboriginal native of South Australia, on Monday November 23 1868, and obtained by me from him on our way home. F. Drought, Police-trooper.’

The second bottle was empty, but the first half-full.

Anyone who would like to try the contents after their having been sipped by Paddy can do so by paying 10/6 to the Burra Hospital. Its presence testifies to the abstinence of Mr Forder, the respected Clerk of the Court, who sat in the office for 40 years with the wine in the cupboard. Trooper Drought was clerk in the office of the Commissioner of Police in Adelaide about 18 years ago, but has now been dead about 15 years.

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. The copper price remains c. £68-11-3 to £68-18-6 and while this is well below the £79-15-0 of 1900 which followed ten years of much lower prices, in which four years were at or below £47-8-9 with a low of £37-17-0, the present price is c. £10 up on 1904 and so favours re-opening the mine. The problem is cost with estimates of £6,000 to £10,000 and the company has not half the former figure and no chance of raising the sum from shareholders. The ore so far recovered would pay on-site treatment, but will not bear the cost of shipment to Wallaroo for processing. The Minister for Mines will supply a pump as the result of a public deputation, but the company must make a proposal to the Government. If the company does not move on this now ‘it must be moribund’. For many years Burra produced 10,000 to 13,000 tons of ore p.a., averaging from 22 to 23% copper and in the 30 years it was worked from 1845 it produced 234,648 tons of ore and 51,622 tons of copper, valued at £4,749,224. It employed an average of 1,000 men, provided general expenditure of £2,241,167 and paid £826,585 in dividends. The mine closed because of low prices, but just before closure Captain Saunders [Sanders] had struck good ore at a comparatively shallow depth below the basin from which the rich carbonates had come. It closed before its sulphides were touched or workings carried below the 300’ level. Since then different methods and working costs and market rates should make the mine payable and lead to its resumption. (From a report in Australian Mining Standard.)

The directors of the Burra Burra Copper Co. advise that the mine is under offer to a London Co.

Burra School Board of Advice visited Burra School on Wednesday and found all in order, but they were struck by the unsatisfactory lighting in some rooms. Also the forms and desks as at present constructed are as uncomfortable as is imaginable for them to be. Skylights are needed.

The Burra Club is reviewed in 2⁄3 column.

In the first room is a nice pair of boxing gloves and training in their use is available.

There are parallel bars and a table for cards and also facilities for club-swinging, dumb-bell exercises etc. The second room is for lads under 17 and is non-smoking. It is set up for reading and several other games.

Upstairs there is a games room for older members and a quiet reading room.

The front room upstairs is a lounge room with piano, magazines and papers etc. and is where cards are played.

Farmers & Producers Political Union, Burra Branch met at the Institute on Friday & passed a motion calling on members to support Mr W.B. Rounsevell whose policy was entirely in accord with that of the union and after that, how they liked. There was a feeling that the decisions from Jamestown & Terowie were unrepresentative of the feelings of those districts. Proceedings were at times lively.

Editorial on The Election. The writer urges people to get out and vote and speaks well of Mr Brice for the Upper House and is sure Mr W.B. Rounsevell will be one of those elected to the hose of Assembly.

The Farmers & Producers Union polled their members and they generally supported Messrs Jenkins, Rounsevell, & Grant. The local branch favoured Messrs Rounsevell, O’Loughlin & Miller and many will follow that despite the general vote. This will undermine the unity of the movement and threaten the result, possibly resulting in the defeat of Messrs Miller and O’Loughlin.

Mr Nykiel, who lost an arm at Burra some years ago, was attacked by an enraged cow at the Elder, Smith & Co.’s sale yard at Burra on Friday. The cow’s horn caught in his trousers and he was flung about for some time, bleeding freely. He has decided ‘Burra is no place for him’.

Editorial on The Burra Mine

Shareholders are asking what is being done. Two attempts have been made to get the directors to get some tangible work done, but things are virtually at a standstill. In the last balance-sheet the directors said the mine was under offer to a London company, but we believe this is not so. If true it seems strange that they are also negotiating with the SA Government for the loan of a pump to unwater the mine. We think neither work nor pumping is likely for some time to come. Nothing can really be done without the company being refloated, there being so little capital available to the directors. Both the shareholders and the public are disappointed at the lack of development. As a last resort the directors could place the reserve shares on the market at 10/- and allow those shares on which 10/- has been paid to be declared fully paid. This would raise £20,000.

2nd Leader on The Benevolent Society.

Membership of the society is too small to meet demands and so concerts and the like have to be relied upon to raise funds. Receipts for the year were £70-12-6. There is a clear need for more and there is no reason why periodical concerts could not be held and there should be more subscribers.

Empire Day was celebrated in Burra on Wednesday. Four schools were represented: Burra, Burra High School [Bleak House], St Joseph’s & Miss Thomas’s. The proceedings are reported in over 1 column and the sports results are printed.

Roy Wilsden, a young lad, was run into by a spring dray on Saturday and badly bruised by the shaft.

Anlaby. The Government has bought 24,000 acres of the Anlaby Estate for £3-2-6 per acre. It will be divided into 400 acre blocks for agriculture and 1,000 acre blocks for grazing.

Accidents. Wet weather has caused a number of horses to slip over on wet roads in the last week, but fortunately with no serious consequences.

Rain began to fall last Saturday and continued through Sunday. Kooringa recorded 145 points.

Burra Jubilee Benevolent Society. The annual report shows the society issued 434 orders: 345 for firewood, 58 for groceries & 31 for drapery. The income was £70-12-6 which with money in the bank totalled £138-17-2. Expenditure was £73-12-7, which left £65-4-7 in the bank. Elected were Dr Sangster (President), J.F. Moore (Treasurer), T.W. Wilkinson (Secretary) & E.F. Lockyer (Assistant Secretary).

Obituary. Mr James Cook of Kapunda, father of Mrs Grosser of Burra, died on Wednesday last when his horse started quickly while he was standing in his grocer’s cart attending to a customer. He was thrown out onto the ground and broke his neck. [Died 24 May 1905 at Allendale North aged 69.]

Obituary. Mr James Mann of Hallett died suddenly on Friday. He came to Burra and worked for Tommy Hutton, a blacksmith in a shed almost opposite Dr Sangster Senior’s and later he had his own business close to where D. Jones has his paint shop. He later went to Aberdeen and had a business on the site on which the old National Bank now stands. He then moved to Mt Bryan and later still took on the hotel there. After that he took the Hallett Hotel now occupied by Mr Lewis. He made and lost a fortune. His last place of business was at the hotel near the Hallett Railway Station. He married Miss Annie Armstrong, who was at the Burra Hotel, now the hospital. He leaves two sons and two daughters: Jim (Burra), W. (Broken Hill), Mrs B. Bourman (Burra) & Mrs J. Sutton (Broken Hill).

[Died 26 May 1905 aged 63.]

Redruth Reformatory

On 4 May three girls, Florence Linguist, Alice Seitner & Alice House attempted suicide by drinking Quibell’s disinfectant. The girls recovered and have lost certain privileges. The first two have not previously been troublesome, but Alice House is regarded as incorrigible. Although not yet of age Alice House married a Chinaman Ah Tuck who lives at Findon. She pretended to be over 21.

The first two girls gave no reason for their actions and Alice House said it was a dreadful thing to be a State Child. An earlier incident when most staff and several girls were apparently afflicted by poison is now believed to have been accidental poisoning by ptomaine as a result of eating tainted meat.

Alice Seitner’s parents live at Baldina and she is in the Reformatory for misconduct at home.

[Marriage records show Alice House, daughter of Frederick House, and aged 21 to have married Ah Tuck, son of Way May aged 31 at the residence of C. Worthley Brompton Park 14 April 1905. She was actually born 5 June 1887 and so was only 17 at the time.]

[Alice Seitner was sent to the reformatory for being a neglected child and any misconduct was more likely to have been by her parents who appear in scandalous circumstances in the paper: VI, 434, 24 April 1885, page 3; XV, 436, 26 Sep. 1900, page 3 & XV, 437 (2), 10 Oct. 1900, page 3.]

The Burra Club. If the club is still in existence in 12 months the billiard table lent by Mr Hiddle will become their property.

Strawberries. Is C.C. Heinrich of the Burra Hotel the only local growing a strawberry bush? It is possible experimental gardeners like Messrs Fuss, Baker or Oppermann have tried it and it is for knowing the result that we ask this favour and also to decide a wager in respect to it.

Foxes. Bungaree & Hill River Stations are paying £1 a head for foxes. Sightings recently have been:

Burra town Council intends to replace missing street trees.

Game. A party that went shooting on Saturday scored 12 hares and 2 rabbits. Turkeys are very scarce, though several were seen on Wednesday, ‘but as it is close season it is not for us to say what became of four of them’.

Rain. Some more has fallen to bring the year’s total so far to 4.97”.

A Bolt. W.T. Truscott’s horse bolted as it was being taken out of the butcher’s cart on Wednesday. It careered down the lane at the back of the shop and into Chapel St then round Kangaroo St and Stock St to Thames St. There, opposite Frederick’s eating-house, the traces still attached to it twisted round a tree and the animal was brought up against it with great force. A near side rib punctured its hide, stripped about three feet of bark, and was embedded in the trunk. Despite this and grave internal injuries it made off again between the road roller and a fence, but was stopped and led back to the stable where it had to be put down.

Mr W.J. Hinde SM is not moving to Wallaroo after all, but to Pt Augusta to replace Mr J.T. Keats. He will be replaced here by Mr J.H. Sinclair.

T.F. Robertson, who recently has been severely ill, is still unable to attend to his carrying business at the Burra Station.

Mr Cecil Sangster, son of Dr J. Sangster of Burra, who has been an accountant of the National Bank at Port Germein, has been transferred to Gladstone.

Messrs George & Harry Lockyer, after many years residence, are about to leave Burra. Both were in partnership with their brother, Edward in the Unicorn Brewery, but this was disposed of recently and the hotels are sold or about to be sold. George will go to the city and Harry to Robe where it is probable he will take a hotel. George was a founder member of the Burra Orchestra as a violinist. Harry served two terms as North Ward Councillor on the Town Council.

Miss Kickebusche’s farewell social at the Institute on Thursday was a pronounced success. Over 100 couples came for a few hours dancing. There was a short musical program first and refreshments at midnight followed by dancing till 3 a.m.

Planned Dances. A committee is working on two coming dances: Spinsters will stage a dance for bachelors on 28 June and the Bachelors will return the compliment on 4 August. Setaro’s Band from the City will provide the music.

Farm Produce is again appearing in the town after a long absence due to the seasons. On Friday we learn over 300 lb of butter and 160 dozen eggs were disposed of. One storekeeper said purchases exceeded those of any day for the past four years.

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. Mr T.B. Gall, Chairman of Directors, says a new body of good grade milling ore has been struck in a drive going south from the open cut above water level – it has gone c. 30’ and a crosscut shows the lode 20’ wide the manage says. It is believed to extend to Sander’s or over 300’. It adds to the previously estimated 10,000 tons. There is also ore available at the north end towards Beck’s. It is thought that the installation of a plant now under offer will depend on the report of an expert. (Article from the Advertiser.)

Burra Institute Committee met on Monday at the Institute with C. Fuss (President) in the chair. The Institute is in credit £97-1-5.

Football at Victoria Park on Wednesday: Kooringa 4.15 defeated Robertstown 4.8.

M-C Jemison, formerly of Burra and now at Moonta, has been transferred to Stirling West.

[Stirling North & South are near Pt Augusta so perhaps this is in the Adelaide Hills?]

W.J. Richards had a good time at Morgan after his trip there by motor. His mare Sunbeam won the Trials and was subsequently sold. The trip itself was rough and on his return journey he left Morgan at 1 p.m. on 28 May and arrived at ‘The Gums’ for lunch before continuing through the Black Hills to World’s End, arriving there at 3.30 p.m. and staying overnight before coming home in the following morning. [Nothing here makes it absolutely clear whether ‘motor’ meant a car or motor cycle. He was an agent for the latter.]

The Sod Hut Hotel.

The story of how it got its name may be apocryphal, but it is outlined. In the early days teamsters heading south would fill up with grog at the Old Burra Hotel and then with difficulty navigate the 8 miles south along the road. The builder of the Sod Hut Hotel thought 8 miles about as far as they could go without a refresher. On arriving the teamster had one drink and then another ‘until he became very wet inside then got soddened’, so came the name came from this.

The description of the ruins in 1905 is of a building then still almost intact. The lamppost and frame of the lamp itself with its hanging door rusty and rotten. Nearly all the windows were broken except for a few panes in the front window. Floors and ceilings were gone ‘but the roof is entact [sic] and keeps the interior of the building dry, which is a great inconvenience for travellers who are in need of a rest from the weather.’ [This presumably should have been a great ‘convenience’.] There were several good flags on the verandah floor and half the verandah was still standing, though in an extremely shattered condition. The bridle post with its ring was intact. The front doors resembled those of a large barn and were closed. ‘The size and make of them gives one the impression that those who patronised the hotel needed plenty of room to get in and out. ‘Many of the rooms have been turned into something different to that which they were used for in the olden times.’

Foxes are now appearing in alarming numbers and are set to pose a real problem for pastoralists.

Obituary. Mr Richard Field of ‘Monavea’, about 4 miles from Burra, died on Friday morning. He came to SA in the Victoria Regia, arriving on 15 November 1855. He went first to Islington and after 12 months to Burra where he worked for the English & Australian Copper Co. In 1859 he moved to Victoria and settled at Hamilton, working the land for four years. In 1863 he returned to Burra and the Copper Co. and later worked in the Mine. In 1868 he took up land in the Hundred of Hanson which is now known as ‘Monavea’. He leaves 5 sons and one daughter: G.A. (Gilberton), J.R., F.A.S., & A.W. (Burra), Mrs Wyett of Henley Beach Road. Mrs Field is 77. [Died 16 June 1905 aged 78: born at Chipping Sodbury, England.]

Kooringa Masonic Lodge installed Bro. John McLaren as W.M. on 14 June.

Editorial condemning the management of Redruth Reformatory. ‘It seems monstrous that ‘a brigade of four women cannot exercise that care which is reasonably expected of them over twenty mortals of their own sex.’

‘We have condemned the institution from the start, pointing out that the incarceration of the girls is more liable to make them callous than any good that can be derived from it.’

We wish to know the cause of these escapes. The night was wet and cold yet two young women sought escape for a few hours – they expected to be caught and yet thought it worthwhile. ‘There is a need for an investigation and publicity being given the whole working of the Redruth Reformatory.’

‘The girls ventilated their grievances to a lady friend and until these statements are refuted she has every reason to believe them.’

‘We can understand girls seeking their liberty, but we utterly fail to see the reasonableness of them resorting to actions to deprive them of life, as was the case recently.’

Kooringa Methodist Church held Special Mission services last Monday.

The old Burra Hotel Weighbridge has been moved from Market Square to Aberdeen and will be used there by Drew & Crewes.

Escapes from Redruth Reformatory.

On Wednesday evening M-C Grosser was told Bertha Learmouth & Ruby Cotter had escaped from the Reformatory. The night was wet and foggy and the roads sloppy, but Grosser kept on seeking their location. On Thursday morning he got a trap and went east and after learning no news of them he returned to Burra and learnt they had been seen on the Sod Hut Road. By dusk the two were at the residence of Mr Watts at Glenora (between Black Springs and Waterloo). This is Bertha’s fifth escape and ruby’s third. They were overtaken there and returned to Mrs Holden.

## XV, 682, 28 June 1905, Page 3

William Hannaford writes re the naming of Sod Hut. He arrived in the colony with bullocks in 1847 and came to Burra to cart copper to Port Adelaide. He doesn’t believe the hotel got its name from men soddened by drink. Before Dan O’Leary built the Sod Hut Hotel there was a sheep station in the Gully and it was there that the teamsters camped and it was there the strike occurred for a higher price to cart copper to Pt Adelaide. It was there that the teams were stopped. The old hut was built of pug and it was common to see 30-40 teams in camp.

The Burra Mine

For over thirty years the old Burra Mine has been looked upon as a great thing that would one day bring salvation to the town and to SA as a whole. We believe the day is nor far distant when the old copper town will enjoy prosperity on a greater scale than ever before.

A rumour was circulated yesterday that the manager Mr James Pryor had made a discovery of some importance. He took our representative underground to see for himself. At the bottom of the open cut the manager has put in a drive aiming to intersect with Peacock’s Air Shaft. It has progressed some 60ft and in the process has found some excellent milling stuff. But as development proceeds a lode was struck measuring over 30ft from which boulders of ore too large for one man to lift were won. Such a find has not been encountered since the best days of the old mine. Already many bags of oxides and carbonates have been placed to one side and the huge rocks of high grade ore are being stacked elsewhere in the mine. The ore at this depth (water level) is better than near the surface, proving that the lode improves as it goes down. Thousands upon thousands of tons of payable ore is in sight and it would take years to work out. Mr Pryor is satisfied he has struck a main lode which will go at least 40% with little dressing. No mine in SA is more encouraging at present. All that is lacking is machinery. If it were here thousands of tons of high grade concentrate could be treated at once. The lode is well defined and while we were there boulders of copper ore were being got out from a face 30ft in width. It is to be hoped machinery will now be installed and the water pumped to allow the lode to be followed down. Without this nothing can be done. Recent rains have exposed milling stuff all around the open cut – unpayable at the time of the old mine, but useful with modern machinery.

The directors have been informed and are expected to visit any day.

## XV, 683, 5 July 1905, Page 6

The Spinsters & Bachelor’s Ball is reported in 2⁄3 column.

31 dances were gone through beginning at 8 p.m. with refreshments at 10.30 in the lodge room. Supper was served at 1.30 a.m. and soup was served before they departed after further dancing.

Dr Sangster jun. writes taking issue with the leading article of 21 June. He denies emphatically that ‘when the girls are once sent there their lives are blighted and opportunities of amelioration lost’. There are many letters at the Reformatory from former inmates which will refute that. ‘That they should resort “to actions to deprive them of life” is as difficult to understand as the motive underlying many similar cases in public life.’

We are informed that the public is indignant.

‘In what way, I ask, have the public ever shown the least interest in the working of the institution or practical sympathy with the lot of the girls?’

Dr Sangster also takes issue with describing the staff as a ‘Brigade of four women’ and the insinuation that the matron was light heartedly enjoying herself while the girls were miserable in durance.

The editor claims that he gladly publishes the letter if by doing so ‘The feelings of our correspondent as well as those of others connected with the Redruth Reformatory will be much alleviated when they see it in print. He claims to have no axe to grind.

‘As to the garbled statements appearing in several newspapers concerning the recent poisoning cases at the Reformatory . . . we would point out that the statements came from a source that would not stand denial. We can assure the writer that the public are much concerned about the management though they refrain from rushing into print. We have received several letters upholding us in our comments, and were they published there would be even a greater demand for hair dye than at present; in fact the management would bid a quick retreat, the girls would be liberated and the building would collapse.’

Editorial on the Burra Mine.

After a very long wait with not much happening ‘a rich lode of not only payable but profitable ore has been struck’ as reported last week. All that is needed is the erection of suitable machinery to treat thousands upon thousands of tons of high-grade milling stuff. If work was commenced tomorrow the speculation would prove highly profitable. We believe nothing better will be struck above water level. There is now no excuse for the directors not to succeed except the lack of capital. The allotment of shares should be rearranged (if necessary) by putting those shares held by the directors on the market which would raise something like £20,000. [Presumably this refers to shares held in reserve by the company rather than shared held personally by the directors.] While this is not enough to fully develop the mine, it would open up the find and would immediately give good returns. The mine has ceased to be a speculative venture as what was sought has been found. All this when the town is ‘in such a dilapidated and destitute state’. ‘Our population is fast decreasing. Many families that are left are in a starving condition, and they have no hope beyond work at the mine being proceeded with.’

Coursing. [Local coursing had become moribund, but some local men kept dogs for coursing and ran them elsewhere.]

[The death does not seem to be registered in SA, but the Maurice Ledwith born c. 1841, who married Hanna Elizabeth Head in 1862, did come to Burra where the three of the couple’s nine children were born between 1878 & 1882, though in the Copperhouse & Flagstaff area.]

Rain. Good falls were recorded in the last week and on Tuesday morning the Burra Creek was flowing strongly.

## VX, 684, 12 July 1905, Page 5

The Burra Mine. Since last week the manager of the mine, Mr Pryor, has been seeing to the best way of hauling up rocks from the recent discovery to the surface, through an old shaft. The men have been following the lode in a northwest direction and it is looking even better than it did last week. Blasting has been introduced and there is every indication that the lode will continue much further. A portion of the underground workings is now blocked by ore and hauling operations to clear it have seen a second shift of men put on today. The directors visited last Friday and were well pleased and they wish to put suitable machinery in place, but this will demand careful consideration. [The capital available was very limited.] The milling stuff available would appear likely to exceed expectations when it is put through the concentrating plant.

Editorial on The Burra Mine.

When the old mine stopped the tower engine and crushing plant with jigs was working well. With but little outlay these could be put in working order and while modern machinery might be an improvement the old would suffice to get things started. The directors have been reluctant to invest in machinery until ore was found. Now it has been, so there is a grand opportunity to get moving. The other alternative is a reconstruction or reflotation of the company.

Burra Mine

Our mining reporter visited and found Mr Pryor preparing a set of timber for the mine. He went past a few tributors at work to reach the drive. The exposed ore body is smaller than before, the lode having turned northeast. The men have driven quite 20ft on the line of the lode. The urgent need for machinery is very evident. Without it opportunity is being lost. Thousands of tons of milling ore are being passed in the drive and it is clear a concentrating plant would give handsome returns. Many pounds worth of ore has now been placed at the mouth of the old shaft where it has been hauled up. From all appearances the future of Burra will be one of prosperity and it is to be hoped that arrangements for the long looked-for machinery will be speedily made.

Aberdeen Ballast Quarry will shortly start work again according to rumour, as soon as the District foreman Mr Harvey can make arrangements for an engine. This will absorb some of the surplus labour in the town.

[This would seem to be a gross error. Vivian had the Commercial hotel 1886-1912, but that hotel dates only from 1876. There was an earlier Commercial Hotel that operated 1859-c. 1862, but the original Burra Hotel was the town’s first and operated 1846-76.]

The Burra Mine. A glimpse of the underground workings shows that since the Burra Burra Copper Co. took over excellent work has been done. Everything about the recent discovery is encouraging. Work on the drive has been suspended while a ventilation shaft is prepared from the southeast drive to the northwest drive from Peacock’s Air Shaft. Excellent milling material has been taken out in the process. The first big lode struck since Captain Pryor took over was at the 60 ft level, but on testing the ground below that depth the lode was lost. Then in another part of the mine the same quality ore was found at 115 ft. If machinery was erected the mine could be transformed from its dormant state to one of great activity. The reporter believed there was more ore in sight than 200-300 men could get out in several years. It is a great pity the machinery is not quickly forthcoming.

Aberdeen Ballast Quarry opened again on Monday and a few men were put on, but the district foreman, Mr S. Harvey, will increase the numbers as soon as possible.

William Southon had an amazing ride through town on Wednesday. Having had rather more wine than was wise he got into his spring dray at the Burra Hotel with some difficulty. Standing up in his cart he whipped up the horse which took off for Redruth. At about the post office the reins got tangled and amazingly the horses managed a U-turn and dashed back into Market Square with Southon still standing in the cart – whip in one hand and hat in the other while singing Break the News Gently to Mother. He got to the reins in time to amaze all the onlookers by negotiating Parks’s corner and careered up Chapel St where he stopped to sell a broom – many of which he had for sale. Here M-C Grosser overtook him and placed him for a time in ‘his little cot’.

[The court case which followed is reported on page 5.]

William Southon (20) was charged with being drunk in Market Square and was fined 5/- or 7 hours. He was also charged with furious driving. He admitted to being drunk on wine for the first time after spending 11/- in a few minutes. Mr E.W. Crewes advised him to become an abstainer and he said he would. He was fined 10/-. Arrangements were made for someone to pay the fines.

M-C Jemison, formerly a policeman at Burra was then sent to Moonta and lately to Stirling East. Things there did not go well for him. [Or to quote the paper: ‘didn’t go too good with him’.] He has resigned from the police force owing to continued illness and is in a private hospital in the city.

The Remarkable Case of Thomas Whelan.

A man in a poor state called for food at a station out east and the owner thought he was not fit to roam the bush and sent word to M-C Grosser. The policeman found the man lying down in a hut. He got up and put on his poor clothes, but wore a handkerchief round his neck. He gave his name as Thomas Jackson, but later admitted it was Thomas Whelan, aged 34. Grosser was concerned at how he carried his head and removed the cloth about his neck. Whelan’s throat was terribly gashed from one side to the other: the windpipe being completely severed. He calmly admitted to doing the deed about five weeks earlier. Since then he had been living on rabbits. He was in a very dirty and tattered state. When offered food he seemed glad to get it, but could not swallow without connecting the windpipe with the aid of his hands. The wound had begun to heal and was not bleeding. He had walked from Victoria to WA and thence by various means to SA. He was brought to the Burra Hospital where he will be operated on this week.

There is a little over 1 column report on this mine which is some 20 miles N-E of Leigh Creek. Mr C.A. Fuss, one of the directors, reported to interested shareholders on Wednesday at the Institute. Mr Winnall presided. A recent visit convinced Mr Fuss that the mine had a bright future. He expected recent ore to show 22% copper. Various shafts have been sunk and samples suggest a large lode of good quality ore. A larger plant is expected to be in use in about six months. There are 600 shares in the company. Cartage from Leigh Creek is £1 a ton, but less if back loading becomes available. Rail costs 16/10 per ton to Wallaroo and smelting a trifle over £2 per ton. The new plant is expected to cost £500. 20 men are currently employed.

There was a fairly large attendance. The presentation was a cabinet of cutlery and a silver tea and coffee set and tray. The Mayor made the presentation. The Hon. J. Lewis MLC endorsed all the good things said by the Mayor as he had a long association with Mr Needham. Mr Needham had been 32 years in the department and 17 in Burra. P.L. Killicoat JP also spoke in support as did Mr Flower on behalf of the Agricultural Bureau. Mr Needham made an appropriate response.

Court.

Yesterday Thomas Whelan was charged with attempting to take his own life. He had been found out east three weeks ago with his throat cut. He is a young man of about 24 ‘of foreign decent’ [sic]. He did not know why he did it. He seems to have gradually grown depressed through unemployment, a rough bush life and growing weakness. He was fined £1 and bound to keep the peace for three months. He was also charged with unlawful possession of some cooking utensils of a man named Hill in the Hundred of King. For that he was fined 10/- (or 14 days). He said he wanted to get work. The bench was anxious to help as much as possible and suggested the Salvation Army in Adelaide would assist, though Whelan was reluctant to accept help. [It is not clear whether the fines were paid or he ended up in jail. See also VX, 688, 9 Aug. 1905, Page 4-5 where his age is given as 34.]

Reminiscences of John Hele.

In 1848 he was a bullock teamster to Burra when most people were living in the creek and living very comfortably there in 2-4 rooms. Chimneys were of dry ware casks on some with others level with the ground. Men who drank too much or who wandered about in the dark sometimes fell right through an opening into the room below. Sometimes cooking food was forked from above and stolen. He recalls the big flood that ended it all. At the time 200 to 300 teams were at work between Burra and Adelaide moving goods at £2 to £2-10-0 a ton, though later the captain and storekeepers cut it to 35/- which caused a teamsters’ strike. The centre of the strike was at Dan O’Leary’s Sod Hut Hotel. Captain Chase led the strike and stopped teams at the Sod Hut camp. Eventually he had between 80 and 100 there. Storekeepers had to come out there from Burra to get their goods. One day a man called Hobby, in charge of five teams belonging to Bell Freeman of Dry Creek, talked his way through to Burra on condition of no back-loading. He broke his word and took a load back to Tothill’s Belt. When about 150 men working at the Belt heard of his dirty trick they took action. In the morning Hobby found himself 18 bullocks short and he spent two months looking for them, eventually he found three hides. Eventually the strikers went into Burra and unloaded and proceeded to the ore floors to reload. When Captain Chase appeared Captain Roach set four dogs on him, but the bullockies in turn set their dogs on Roach, who beat a hasty retreat to his office.

The roads were bad. Hele had seen 12 and 13 teams bogged in a half-mile’s length – some with broken poles, broken axles and broken wheels etc. – especially at a place called Bald Hill.

‘Grissley Fred’ drove the mail in a two-wheeled spring cart pulled by three horses in tandem. The mail contractor was Jimmy Chambers of Adelaide. Mail was due to start at 6 a.m. from the Burra Hotel and up to five or six days was sometimes required for the journey. Hele had seen the mail cart towed in behind a bullock wagon because the roads were so bad. One night when ‘Grissley’ was taking passengers to Burra it was dark and wet and they got to a sticky spot that he thought he could get through, but actually only managed to get half way. He asked the passengers to get out, but some objected. ‘Grissley’ got down and unfastened the belly band and asked the passengers to sit back a bit and when they complied they found themselves suddenly in the mud and slush. He answered their vows of vengeance with the comment it was his new way of unloading them when in difficulties.

Mr Hele is 70 years old and lives in Coward Springs. [136 km west of Marree.]

Fairview Phosphate Claims. A.H. Hassell from Victoria has lost no time in securing claims previously held by E.N. Finch, S. Baker, P.L. Killicoat and C. Fawcett.

These gentlemen have approached the Mines Dept. pointing out the delay in the office not acceding to the request of the claimholders to renew their licences. Renewals were sought, but before replying the Dept. granted a licence to Mr Hassell. The gentlemen concerned have done considerable work and have not been deprived through any infringement of the regulations. We understand the original holders will be reinstated.

St Mary’s Rectory Opening Ceremony.

Rev. Canon Webb of Clare dedicated the new rectory on Saturday. Tables decorated with wattle blossom held every kind of eatable. Oysters in aspic, salmon croquets, corned beef, lamb, roast goose, roast and boiled fowl, rhubarb tart, apple tart, vanilla creams, jellies and cheese. Dinner was in the large double room. J.C. Sandland as clerk of works summed up the building.

The foundations had to be dug 2’ instead of 1’ to find solid ground, adding £33 to the cost, bringing it to £388-19-10. The contractors had worked very well and in a friendly spirit. Robertson Bros. of Gawler carried out the work. He would like to see a verandah, but that could come later.

Mr Winnall outlined the financial arrangements. They had started with £54 and had borrowed £50 each from three gentlemen. Collecting since Easter had been successful so that only a debit of £150 remained.

Mr Fuss of Fuss Bros. appreciated the kind remarks with reference to the workmanship and thanked Mrs Wightwick for her hot tea throughout the cold weather. [This suggests that Fuss Bros. did the carpentry since the Robertson Bros. appear from the above to have had the principal building contract, but the report then says the Robertson Bros. had done the plastering and the Tiver Bros. must also feel proud of their work.]

Rev. Wightwick thanked the Hon. J. Lewis, Mrs T. Sandland and Mr Barker, who had lent sums of £50 each. [Either Mrs T. Sandland was one of the gentlemen mentioned above, or this is a misprint for Mr.]

The rectory is entered from the eastern side through a large door of ecclesiastical design at the sides of which are cathedral glass. This leads to a hall 17’ x 10’ fitted with hat racks etc. To the left is a bedroom 17’ x 13’ x 12’ high. The drawing room is entered through a passage door where it is divided from the drawing room [sic] by double folding doors 10’ wide to make, when open, a large room 38’ x 14’. The study is entered from the passage and is 13’ x 13’. The new building is built up close to the front verandah of the old. The whole has been pointed and lined though in the absence of the much needed verandah it presents a naked appearance when approached from the south.

Burra Show was held last Wednesday 27 September.

There was rain on the 26th and up to about 9 a.m. on the 27th, but by noon the weather was very good and the largest crowd for some years was seen at the park. Almost £80 was taken at the gate. The secretary, Mr John McLaren, remains the main pillar of the society. Agricultural entries were down, but the quality was up. Dairy produce was a good display and poultry was one of the highlights. Draught stock entries were larger. Blood stock entries were few, but roadster stock was quite nicely represented. Dogs were more numerous this year, but cattle and pigs were very scarce. Sheep as usual were the main feature of the show and Thomas Sandland was the main prize-taker. Over £20 was taken at the door of the evening concert.

Hyland’s Circus visited Burra and performed to fair houses on Friday & Saturday nights. The horsemanship displayed was the highlight and the wire-walking by Miss Hyland was exceptional. The performance was at the rear of the Commercial Hotel. At the conclusion of one performance a youth in charge of the horses somehow allowed two of them to go on the narrow footbridge which spans the creek leading to the circus ground, but two horses got onto the bridge from the other direction. On of the horses did a miraculous turn, but Sovereign the most valuable animal in the circus fell about six feet into the creek. Fortunately it was not hurt.

St Joseph’s Bazaar was held on Friday and Saturday and good weather produced a good attendance. Rev. Father Redden opened it – the Hon. John Lewis being unable to do so at the last minute. He recounted the history of the church and its debt.

8 February 1857 St Joseph’s school-church opened in Commercial St

1870 Sisters of St Joseph took over the school

8 November 1874 Present St Joseph’s opened

1881 Old school & house sold to Hon. John Lewis: new convent & school erected

1885 St Joseph’s [presbytery] built by Father O’Dowling [word missing in text]

1886 Rev. Father O’Dowling comes to live in Kooringa

The original contractor for the church tendered too low and abandoned the work. The building was then carried on as ‘day work’ and the cost nearly doubled. The debt amounted to £1,920.

The untiring efforts of Father Kriessel reduced it to £1,004 by 1880.

Then the erection of the school and convent in 1887 [sic, but see above 1881?] and in 1885 the presbytery saw it rise to £2,430 by 1886.

The debt then grew until by in 1890 it was £2,882.

Since then the debt has been reduced by £876 and on 30 September, a month prior to Rev. Father Redden taking charge, it stood at £2,006.

But in the last four years it has crept up again and on 30 September 1905 it was £2,230.

Rates, taxes and insurance premiums are c. £150 p.a. and sundry expenses such as repairs and lighting etc. cost c. £25 p.a.

The bazaar raised over £100.

Yesterday morning it was found to have been shot in the udder and on investigation no fewer than 40 distinct shot wounds were counted and about 12 in the flank. The wound was sickening to look at and the animal was in excruciating pain. About three weeks ago the same animal was stabbed in the flank. Police are investigating and we hope the public will give any aid they can to clear up this atrocious and abominable incident.

Fair View Phosphate Mine. Work continues. There is no news regarding the claims of Messrs Killicoat, Finch, Rosewall & Baker. Mr Arthur Haselle writes to us in response to the article in the Record of 27 September saying: I have never jumped a claim in my life; for the past eight years I have held large interests in S.A., on Yorke’s Peninsula; I have a business at Port Adelaide, and until recently had my steamer trading in S.A. waters.’

Burra Musical & Dramatic Club’s performance of Our Boys at the Institute on Friday evening drew a splendid attendance. The large hall was well filled and over £13 was taken for the reserved seats. The performance was very good, and is reviewed in something over a column. In all over £22 was taken.

Burra Town Council.

A.H. Haselle writes asking whether the town bridge will safely carry the weight of a traction engine and wagons conveying phosphate to the Burra railway station – a total load of 13-14 tons. The question was referred to the main road surveyor. [It would seem likely that this question would relate to the Redruth Bridge rather than the Kingston St Bridge as it was on the most direct route from the east to the station.]

Burra Mine

The reporter was told by Mr Pryor, the manager, that it has been decided to pump water from the open cut to a depth of 50ft. The contract is understood to have been signed and the operations will begin in a couple of months. This is a commendable action. This will enable work to be done on a huge body of ore that was passed in the last drive and expose what ore was in sight when the mine shut down. About 20 tons of ore has been sent away – estimated at 20% – from the drive being developed. The result of the pumping will decide if it is worthwhile putting in the machinery to treat the ore here. The directors are hopeful and intend to lose no opportunity that the pumping discloses. Residents are looking forward to good times and a revival of the town, though it is not likely much progress can be made before the New Year.

Burra Mine

We hear from the best authority that a contract to unwater the mine has been signed and work will be pushed on as soon as possible, though nothing of note will be done till the new year. Sceptics still think this is only to allow further time to do something else. Captain Pryor has gone to Kapunda to have a look at some machinery there which, it is said, is suitable for the treatment of ore here.

Marriage. Last Wednesday W. Morgan, son of John Morgan of Baldina, married Mabel Bullen, 5th daughter of W. Bullen.

Telegraph Changes.

With the telegraph work of the railways to be done away with it is proposed that a messenger from the Kooringa Post Office is to meet the train four times a day to take delivery of telegrams for distribution in the town. This would considerably hamper the telegraphic department of the Kooringa Post Office as the messenger would be absent from there for three hours a day and would also have to be on guard from 6.30 a.m. to all hours at night. This is unworkable and is sure to raise protests.

United Friendly Societies Sports will be held on Boxing Day at Victoria Park.

Salvation Army. At the Barracks on Monday night a very fair attendance, despite the poor weather, heard Major Graham’s lecture on ‘Missionary Work of the Army’. Other stirring addresses were also given.

Ensign Good announced the self-denial collection for 1905 was a surprising £72-10-0 which was £32-10-0 over target and £5 more than ever before.

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. half-yearly report.

Development in the period cost £374-8-2 in the area mainly of Peacock’s Shaft and Peacock’s Bye-shaft. 20 tons of ore assaying at 23-35% was sent to Wallaroo. The company has contracted with Messrs C.A. Smith & Co. to lower the water level in the mine from 25 to 50 feet, on most satisfactory terms.

C.A. Fuss has returned from Paull’s Consolidated Copper Mine. He reports the mine looks good and erection of the big plant is being pushed on with and should be finished in about two months. The ore bodies now showing promise big returns when treated by the plant.

M-C Grosser was given a farewell social on Friday night by members of the Masonic Lodge in a large room adjoining the hall and there was a large attendance despite the rough weather with both wind and rain from 7 p.m. Mrs Grosser was presented with a handsome silver sugar basin, afternoon spoons and tongs and a set of carvers and cutlery in a case. Vocal and other items by ladies and gentlemen were followed by refreshments. With his departure for Angaston the town loses a courteous and capable officer, who has done some very clever work in the 3 years 8 months he has been here.

The season is not more than fair in Baldina, but the crops get steadily better towards Robertstown and are very good by Eudunda. Manoora crops are good and Farrell’s Flat area has pretty fair average crops and at Leighton and Gum Creek they are good. Further north crops are a bit thinner, but looking good. Rain in the last week will have been a help generally to these crops.

[Page 5 adds that in the last week 294 points have fallen in Kooringa with 184 since last Friday.]

[Joseph Richard Jemison born at Pt Elliott 28 November 1863: died Kadina 5 November 1905.]

The Motor Car and the Horse.

A local storekeeper’s horse saw something very rare in Burra on Saturday, but it didn’t strike him as being very acceptable to the eye, so he decided to ‘do a get’, taking the hospital road for it. The introduction of Dr Sangster’s motor car was the cause of the trouble, though nothing serious happened; this was owing to the smartness of Billy Barkley jumping on a sort of offspring of a motor, and overtaking the animal just as it was meditating about seeking admission to the hospital for treatment for nervous debility. The quadruped was taken back to the shop and cautioned. No damage was done; therefore Billy has no need to raise the price of groceries.

Departures. More Burra residents are leaving us.

Obituary & Inquest. The late M-C Jemison who died at Kadina last week leaves a wife and six children.

M-C Jemison’s life ended sadly at the Central Hotel in Kadina on Sunday 5 November. He will be remembered in Burra where his term was marked by a variety of unusual circumstances. About 3years 8 months ago he was transferred to Wallaroo and later to Stirling. He resigned from the police and kept a store at Paskeville. His death was sudden, but not entirely unexpected.

A letter from Mrs Jemison caused P-C Baker of Kadina to seek him out and he was found to be very ill at the Central Hotel. Blake asked him to go home, but by 11 o’clock he was too ill to travel and appeared to be having a fit. He had been drinking whisky and an envelope nearby bore the word ‘strychnine’, but he denied having taken any. He complained of head and chest pains, but insisted they were only ‘the old complaint’. When the doctor arrived he was already dead.

Ebenezer Phillips of the Salvation Army has spoken to him on Sunday morning at the railway station when Jemison had admitted he had contemplated suicide and said he had been fighting the night before and expected the police were after him.

Dr Powell said the symptoms matched strychnine poisoning.

Mrs Jemison said her husband had recently taken to drink because of severe head pains and the previous Saturday he had experienced a fit and for fifteen minutes they had thought him dead.

The verdict was death by poisoning but with no evidence to show whether by alcohol or strychnine.

[Joseph Richard Jemison was born 28 November 1863 at Pt Elliott and died 5 November 1905 at Kadina.]

Redruth Court

Joe Ford sued William Paddock, late of the Bon Accord Hotel, for £11 being the rent allegedly owed on a block of land used by the latter.

Mr Ford said a woman, Mrs Hingles now deceased, had acted as Paddock’s agent and he had let the two blocks of land near the hotel for 2/- a week.

Mr Winnall for Paddock said Mrs Hingles was not Paddock’s agent. She had been a pensioner of Mr Ford’s and lived in one of his houses. Ford admitted she had paid no rent for the house she occupied.

Mr Sinclair said Mr Ford might ask for recompense under ‘use and occupation’, but even that was not certain. Though he was reluctant to stop a case where there was any possibility of justice, he could not see the use of proceeding under the circumstances.

21 November

The English & Australian Copper Co. appealed against their town assessment. Mr Gall appeared for the appellants and F.J. Packard for the Council. Mr Packard objected that the property was not identified by the appellants because the lot numbers used appeared in more than one ward. Mr Sinclair ruled that nevertheless their identity was not really in doubt and he was more concerned over the omission of the word ‘rateable’. Mr Gall said the property must be rateable to be assessed.

The E. & A. Copper Co. wanted the assessment of a property in East Ward reduced from £24 and the Council agreed to £22, but Mr Killicoat for the E. & A. Copper Co. said its real value was c. £19. He said repairs to it had averaged £3-18-6 p.a. for the last five years. Mr Packard said its annual rental was £27 and that made the assessment fair. Eventually the assessment was reduced to £18.

The SM then said that if the other cases were on a par with that a conference between counsels was advisable and accordingly he adjourned the court. An agreement was then made to reduce the following assessments:

No. 53 in North Ward from £5 to £2-10-0

No. 57 in North Ward from £20 to £15

No. 58 in North Ward from £3 to £1

No. 3 in East Ward from £22 to £18

No. 4 in East Ward from £22 to £18

No. 5 in East Ward from £5 to £3

No. 7 in East Ward from £10 to £5

[The significance of this case lay in the general decline of property values in the town and the consequent need for a new assessment to avoid a flood of appeals in the following year.]

Burra United Friendly Societies’ Sports on Boxing Day will have £33 in prize money for cycling events. There will be new horse and pony jumping events. The track is being prepared and one of the local ‘cracks’ is training to capture the £16 wheel race.

Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting, Burra Institute on Wednesday evening.

Only three or four were present at 8 p.m. Mr C. Fuss was elected chairman. During the evening numbers increased, but never to more than twenty.

The Mayor Mr Winnall read his report. The year’s work had been carried out with economy and on the whole harmoniously.

Cr Drew had little to add. He agreed with the Mayor and said he was in favour of making footpaths, tree planting and tar dressing.

Cr Neville thanked Councillors for their assistance and hoped he had given ratepayers satisfaction.

Cr Launder’s remarks were in a similar vein.

The Mayor’s Report was adopted.

Mr Drew as candidate for the Mayoralty said he had no fixed policies, but to promote the interests of the town. He would like to see the footpath from Kooringa to Aberdeen tar dressed, but present money did not allow it. Additional lights were needed and a new assessment too.

Cr Launder was in favour of kerbing.

Mr S. Burns said electors should allow him to do work in his own way if he were elected.

Candidates agreed that if a new assessment were made it would be lower than the present one and therefore the rate would have to rise.

Mr Hardy asked Councillors if they were in favour of refraining from ‘looking for work’, seeing that so much money had been spent on public works.

Generally the response was that there was more than enough that yet needed to be done without looking for projects to spend money on just for the sake of spending it.

The Mayor’s Report 1905

The change to the financial year to make it coincide with the municipal year will give a better idea of the financial state of Council at the end of a term of office than previously when it ended on 31 December.

At the end of 1904 the general account was in credit £45-16-3 compared with £92-1-10 at the Ratepayers’ Meeting that year. It is now £47-19-2, showing that the year’s income has been expended.

Work done by ward:

North Ward £88-11-3 leaving £4-3-11 in hand

East Ward £109-5-5 leaving £7-6-2 in hand

West Ward £64-15-9 leaving £7-7-1 in hand

Rates for the year:

North Ward £100-0-1

East Ward £112-4-71⁄2

West Ward £106-4-41⁄2

Other major income:

Government Subsidy £78-2-11

Dog Licences £25-0-0

Portion of Hawkers’ Licences £79-12-4

Total income £516-12-1

Major salary expenditure was Town Clerk £64-3-4 and Inspector £36-13-4.

The cost of street lamps at £32-6-6 is less due to the purchase of the improved ‘Best’ lights.

Public works cost £241-3-6.

Parklands.

Most expenditure was on Victoria Park. Of the approx. £53 spent tree guards cost £12-15-0 and trees £3-0-9, while labour cost £22-4-10 and materials £13-12-5.

The Cemetery

Income from grave fees was £22-7-6 and from blocks sold £15-0-0. The account was in credit £44-6-6.

Main Roads

Of the main road grant of £273 expenditure on maintenance was £262-1-11.

Local Board of Health

The rate income this year was £180-3-6 and expenditure was light. Principal costs were the Inspector £36-13-4, The Officer of Health £22-18-4 and the Scavenger £68-10-0.

The credit balance is £104-14-1.

VX, 705, 6 Dec. 1905, Page 4

Weather. Last Friday & Saturday high winds combined with high temperatures to bring down many trees and branches and there was the loss of much fruit.

Matron Henniker is leaving Burra for Melbourne after two years in charge here. Nurse Mosey will fill the place for the time being. Miss P. Stevenson, daughter of Rev. Stevenson becomes charge-nurse.

Telephone. Since the telegraph business has been done away with at the railway station telephones have been installed at the Aberdeen post office and the Kooringa post office. Anyone can chat for 3d for 3 minutes. [The main use of this line may have been to deliver telegraphic information to the Kooringa telegraph office since virtually no one had a private telephone and there was no line to Adelaide.]

St Mary’s Strawberry Fete was held at the Burra Institute on Friday afternoon. The strawberry’s caused some concern when they failed to arrive on Thursday night, but 250 lb of them found their was there by noon on Friday and every one was disposed of by day’s end. Over £94 was raised.

[Personal interest: Assisting at the fete were Mrs C. Fuss and two Misses Fuss.]

Accident. The 8-year-old son (Eric) of Thomas Vivian of Opie’s Hotel unwisely rode a horse faster than he was told to last week and when it stopped suddenly at a gate he was thrown off. He is recovering nicely.

Accident. Mr George Tiver was twice thrown from his horse a few days ago when it stumbled in rabbit holes. He injured his arm and was shaken. He too is getting on well.

Burra Schoolteachers’ Association, in existence since 1886, met at Burra on Saturday and this time invited parents and friends along for the first time. George Scott as President welcomed them and the first speaker was Rev. T.H. Wightwick on Ideal Education. C.L. Witham, Assistant Inspector-General of Schools, spoke on discipline and on a new drawing system being taught. Miss Trehy B.Sc. gave a paper on science. The schools represented were: Burra, Copperhouse, Booborowie, Hallett, Mt Bryan, Mt Bryan East, Baldina, World’s End, Hanson, Gum Creek and Koonoona.

Marriage. Kooringa Methodist Church, last Wednesday

Daniel James Quinn of Williamstown married Ada M. Wise, fifth daughter of Mr John Wise of Burra and late of Hallett.

Marriage. Wednesday 29 November at Mt Bryan

Lucy Rush, only daughter of Mr Benjamin Rush of Mt Bryan, married

Fred G. Dawson of Giles Corner near Riverton.

Rev. S.E. Hansen (Lutheran) celebrated his 25th year as a minister on Thursday when about 90 people gathered at the Bright Church. Rev. Nickel of Eudunda preached the ‘Jubilee’ sermon and Rev. Kempe of Balaklava presented Rev. Hansen with an illuminated address. F. Duldig spoke for the congregation and presented an illuminated address and a purse of sovereigns. Rev. Hansen has had a hard time of it since his congregations are widely scattered, ranging from Bright to Brinkworth to Allendale and east to the Murray, taking in Lindley, Shomburg [sic: for Schomburgk] , Bower and Eba.

The Broken Hill correspondent reports a further obituary with the death of another miner Mr Stracke, crushed by a fall of rock at the Central Mine. He was 41. Alf Bevan of Burra assisted in the recovery of the body.

Mr W.T. Rabbich. There is a brief and somewhat oblique reference, giving only his surname, to William Thomas Rabbich, a former Burra Mayor who had gone to live in Boulder WA. He was apparently standing for election, but for what is not made clear. [Later reference discloses that it was for election as Mayor of Boulder.] His political opponent ‘stigmatised Rabbich as a political weathercock, a beer and brick politician, a prevaricator, a strange old man, who had been an unsuccessful aspirant for the only position in Boulder that he could satisfactorily fill – the position of Sanitary Inspector’.

[This suggests he was as controversial a figure in local politics in Boulder as he had been earlier in Burra where he was a Councillor 1880-1882, 1888-1892 & 1894-96 and Mayor December 1892 –November

1893.]

R.M. Harvey, former manager of the Bank of Australasia in Burra, reports that his son Bruce who many will remember here as ‘a knickerbockered little fellow’ has gone to Hong Kong to fill a good and responsible position. Mr R.M. Harvey is now at Shepparton Victoria.

[Another paragraph on page 5 gives the following slightly different version of this report.]

Bruce (18) has been appointed operator at Singapore with the Eastern Extension Cable Co. and will holiday in Hong Kong briefly before taking up his position.

The Burra Labour Bureau. An attempt to form a Labour Bureau here collapsed when hardly anyone attended the initial meeting and Jack Richards refused the attempt to draft him as President.

VX, 705, 6 Dec. 1905, Page 4-5

Jack Winnall [J.E.H. Winnall] went to the city last week to welcome home his mother from the old country, but got his hand crushed against the steamer and needed medical help.

VX, 705, 6 Dec. 1905, Page 5

Jack Drew, the present Mayor, fractured a bone in his instep at a cricket match on Saturday.

Accident. A newly-arrived porter Mr Carless suffered concussion at the Burra Station when he fell from a railway truck. He was to have left Burra this morning to fetch his wife and two children from the city.

Mr Thomas Goode, father of Messrs Goode Bros. of Sheoak Hills and of Dr Goode of Terowie, is leaving Petherton following the sale of that estate and will take up land near Farrell’s Flat. He is over 70 and the father of 14 children of whom 11 survive.

J.L. Kemble, son of John Kemble of Thistlebeds, writes from Katanning WA pleased with the agricultural prospects there.

Miss M.A. Geake has so far survived a serious operation yesterday morning for the removal of a growth in her left breast.

Burra Town Council, 30 November

Cr West took the chair in the absence of Mayor Winnall.

R. Ockenden accepted the lighting of lamps in Kooringa at the old rate.

4 December

First meeting of the new Council. Committees were appointed.

A letter was received from A. Hassell asking for a reply to his earlier letter re the carting of phosphates from the eastern mines by the aid of a traction engine.

The Mayor (J. Drew) was granted six weeks leaves due to his injured foot.

Cricket. Saturday: Stockbreeders 290 defeated Burra 86.

Obituary. Mr John Drew died at his Medindie residence on Monday night. He was one of the firm of Drew & Co. of Burra and Broken Hill and had been ailing for some time. He was 67 and leaves a widow and grown-up family. [Died 12 April 1905.]

Obituary. Mrs John Morgan of Baldina, who has been ailing for some time with cancer, died at Burra Hospital on Sunday aged 50. She leaves one daughter: Hetty Melair (Burra).

[Mrs Morgan is hard to trace in registrations of births etc. She seems to have been born Amelia Mitchell, daughter of Simon/Symon and to have married Lem Soey at Kapunda 10 May 1871. The couple had a daughter, Amelia Laura born at Laura and died at Burra, both in 1880. Another daughter, Amelia, lived for about a week in 1883. On 10 November 1883 she married Michel/Michael Millear and had two children, Harrietette was registered at Kooringa in 1884 and James Edgar in 1888. She married John Morgan on 13 January 1903. The deaths of the first two husbands do not appear to have been registered in SA, but given that Lem Soey appears variously as John Lem-Soy, Lemsoey, Lam Soey, Lem Soey and Soy it may be there somewhere. Millear is also susceptible to many variations. The various sources give her birth between 1850 and 1855.]

VX, 706, 13 Dec. 1905, Page 4 [Number of the issue is jumbled in printing as 6 ___ 70.]

Paull’s Consolidated Copper Co. Mr Chapple has resigned as a director and Mr James McDonald of Leighton has replaced him. With C.A. Fuss already a director Burra investors now have two representatives on the Board.

The weather has been windy and dusty, but so far not hot except for three or four days.

C.A. Fuss, who has been absent from the town for a week, returned on Saturday afternoon after checking on progress at Paull’s Consolidated Copper Mine. Machinery is being erected and Mr Fuss says he expects crushing will commence about February in the New Year. The mine is reportedly looking well.

Burra School Visiting Day was held on Friday. The children recited and sang for their guests and were subsequently addressed by Mr Winnall, Rev. S. Kessell and head teacher Mr Scott.

Obituary. Mr T.W. Pearce who carried on a carpentry and undertaking business in Kooringa for many years has died. Though he had been ailing for some time the death was unexpected. He had been papering a room on Wednesday and returned for dinner feeling unwell. He died shortly afterwards.

[Thomas Whitney Pearce was born 1836 and died 6 December 1905.]

Mrs A.L. Lockyer appeals for ‘loading’ for the Burra Hospital Christmas tree. Though she is no longer in the town, the festivities will continue under the management of Miss Edith Cave.

Harvest has begun. Recent frost and wet weather has resulted in some shrivelling of the grain, but at World’s End the crop looks better than last year and is expected to come in at 12 to 13 bushels per acre.

Mr Carless, who was recently injured in an accident at the railway station, has recovered enough to go to his family in the city for a few days.

Mr Winnall’s badly crushed hand is painful, but improving.

Mr J. Drew’s broken bone in his foot will keep him off work for five weeks.

Frank Moore aged 5, son of Mr A.E. Moore, fell from the ‘Pig & Whistle’ footbridge and received a nasty blow on the head. An operation was needed to lift a piece of skull that was pressing on the brain.

W.F. McEvoy needed medical treatment after a fall from a horse at Hill River on Sunday.

D.B. Kale was charged with non bona fide stock travelling by pretending to take 2,200 sheep to Riverton Market, but then turning back to the Burra Market. He claimed he was acting under instructions from Bagot, Shakes & Lewis. He was fined £22 reduced to £3 + £2-5-0 costs for a first offence.

Rabbits are in plague proportions to the east. Netting of dams is catching hundreds each night and one person reported getting 1,850 in an hour. At Thistlebeds it is easy on a hot day to knock over 300-400 as they come to water. Rabbiters can be seen in almost every paddock. Some are working for wages, some for scalps and carcases. The latter are for export, but the weather is now against this. One rabbiter was bringing in 2,000 on Thursday, but the heat beat him and they had to be unloaded. As many as 45 rabbits are being taken from a single burrow. The Burra District Council last meeting decided to buy several drums of poison to assist in eradication. [On page 5 there is a claim that someone killed over 2,000 in an hour.]

Non-payment of debts to businessmen has increased and now a group of them have formed a fund to finance the taking of debtors to court. Last week a photographer took a man to court over the non-payment of 12/6 and by the time it was heard the debt had increased to £1-10-0. It had been incurred by the man’s wife, who seemed quite unconcerned at the sentence of 10 days in gaol imposed on her husband. At the last minute a friend came forward with the money.

[Page 5 adds details to the above as follows.]

Mrs George Lines with her mother had a dozen photographs taken after assuring the photographer of her ability and intention to pay for them. She then intercepted each account as it arrived in the post and consigned them to the fire. George Lines thus unknowingly ended up in the difficulties described.

George Brown who was charged at Redruth recently with having stolen certain monies from Samuel Ford was tried in Adelaide last week and on being found guilty was sentenced to two years hard labour.

VX, 706, 13 Dec. 1905, Page 5

Matron Henniker has left after two years in the job and has returned to Victoria.

‘Her time spent in the institution has not been likened unto that of an angel therefore the change is welcomed.’

Mr William Thomas Rabbich has been defeated as Mayor of Boulder and the Sun (WA) commented on his defeat:

‘It is as well that Mr Rabbich should be reminded in good time that he has been weighed in the balance and found wanting. Therefore it would be wise for him to take philosophically the lesson he has been taught, which, however painful and expensive, seemed to be necessary in order to teach him modesty and humility. When the citizens want him henceforth, if ever they do, they will doubtless tell him. Till then, meek retirement will excellently become Uncle Tom.’

The Office of Inspector in Burra incorporates the following:

Inspector of Cattle for the Town of Burra

Inspector of Slaughterhouses

Mr Cassaretto of the Court House Hotel has taken over the Mt Bryan Hotel and will move there early in the New Year. He formerly worked for Citizens Life Assurance.

Petherton Estate is to be offered for sale, but the costs imposed appear to be such that no one will be able to make a living from it. It will be two years before a crop can be reaped and before that a hefty interest payment will fall due. To meet it the crop will have to be 12 to 13 bushels per acre and at present much of the adjoining land is yielding only 7 or 8 bushels per acre.

The Broken Hill City Council has purchased the electric lighting plant of Messrs Strachan & Mars.

Baldina School Concert on Monday evening was a success, but the attendance of parents was disappointingly small. Dr Sangster Sen. presided. He was impressed with the quality of the schoolwork on display. Four Compulsory Certificates were earned, but Leslie James and Roy Winders were over 13 and so are not entitled to one. Two Certificates were thus awarded to S. Honeychurch and A. Winders.

Tennis. Aberdeen 4-38 defeated Kooringa 4-35.

A Bolt. Two horses attached to a trap from Booborowie Station were tied to a tree opposite Drew & Crewes yesterday when they were frightened. They managed to break the rope and charged across the street straight for the doorway to the shop. Ten yards from it one of the horses fell and was dragged to the footpath by the other. But for that, they must either have shot into the door or the plate glass window. The animals were gradually calmed and no damage was done to them.

VX, 707, 20 Dec. 1905, Page 4

Editorial. This carries the usual rather saccharine comments on nostalgia for Christmases past, family, peace on earth, Santa Claus and stockings. There is a nod towards the woes of war in Manchuria and revolution in Russia.

Weather. Monday was a hot 97°F.

Kooringa Methodist Church annual hospital service was conducted by Rev. Kessell on Sunday.

W. Dearlove of Ketchowla has sent in £2-2-0 to Drew & Crewes and Jesse Humphrys has contributed £1-1-0 for the poor of Burra and further donations for Christmas cheer would be welcomed.

St Mary’s. A recent concert in the schoolroom on Friday night drew only a small attendance. Dr Sangster delivered an address on Hygiene to the young folk. He spoke in language suitable to their age and perhaps too plainly for the liking of some young listeners on the subject of smoking.

Accident. Mr J. Edwards, son of Harry Edwards of Spring Bank, was coming into Burra with a load of hay and had just crossed the railway line with his team of five horses when a culvert gave way and the front wheel on one side descended to the bottom of the culvert. The hay fell off and with it a younger brother who was lucky not to be hurt. Mr Edwards doesn’t recall how he escaped from the bottom of the hole, but others believe he must have climbed over the shafts to get free from the opposite side. He slightly injured a leg and needed some stitches in a hand.

Father Redden is recovering from his pleurisy that has kept him low for about five weeks.

Miss Geake has returned home after her operation.

The Harvest. Yields have been very disappointing. The heads often look good, but contain little and crops with the appearance of 18-20 bushels per acre are returning one third of that.

Mr & Mrs John Pearce, who are retiring from the Mt Bryan Hotel due to being afflicted with rheumatism, are the most obliging, upright and courteous of people. At one time they ran the Burra Hotel.

C.A. Fuss reports on his visit to Paull’s Consolidated Mine.

He arrived at the mine on 2 December. The erection of the large concentrating plant was being carried out and was almost completed. Crushing operations should begin at the end of January. A good supply of water in the main shaft at a depth of 300ft is expected to be sufficient for the mine’s needs. The mine is looking well and should give good returns when the machinery starts. Considerable attention has been given to the installation of a slime plant in the near future which should be independent of the vanners that will be attached to the present concentrating plant. The contract for sinking No. 2 shaft to 150ft has been completed. Another contract has been let for a drive to enable stoping to be carried out more efficiently. The main and No. 2 shaft are to be fitted with cages to facilitate hauling ore. The plant has the capacity for handling c. 100 tons a day. Mr M. May is supervising the erection.

Accident. Rev. Wightwick’s wife with two children was driving near the Mine Store on Thursday afternoon when a wheel came off her trap. Fortunately no one was injured and after finding the axle cap and replacing the wheel the journey could be continued.

Cricket. At Victoria Park on Saturday: Burra 6 for 228 defeated Robertstown 154.

At Terowie on 16 December Ketchowla 162 drew with Terowie 8 for 101.

St Joseph’s School midsummer display on Tuesday evening drew a crowd of parents and friends. A musical program was creditably performed and the results of the year were announced. [The program is printed.]

Baldina School’s Annual Picnic was held on Wednesday.

Mt Bryan East School held its visiting day on Friday last.

Mt Bryan East Methodist Sunday School will have its anniversary on 24 December.

Advt. E.C.D. Thomas of Ellen Terrace Aberdeen will open a Private School 29 January 1906. Vacancies exist for Music Pupils.

Numbering of issues in 1905

Volume XV which started 7 December 1892 finally ended with issue number 683 of 5 July 1905.

The year began with Volume XV Number 658 on 4 January 1905

And continued to

Volume XV 683 on 5 July 1905. Within this series number 668 was used twice.

Then

Volume VX began with Number 684 on 12 July 1905

And continued to Volume VX Number 707 on 20 December 1905

The type for 706 is jumbled so that it appears as 6 __ 70.

VX is of course not a proper Roman numeral and was presumably simply a mistake in setting XV.

The error was perpetuated till the end of 1910 when the paper reverted to Volume XV.

Burra High School [Bleak House] held an ‘At Home’ for prize distribution. Rev. Wightwick presided and Mrs John Drew gave out the prizes. The entertainment program is printed as is the list of prize winners. Among the latter Hazel Bartholomaeus was Senior Division Dux and Vera Fuss won a prize for 2-years Full Attendance, Mrs Roach’s Arithmetic Prize, the Rector’s Scripture Prize and was second in Senior Division. In the Intermediate Division Flossie Richards was top and in the Junior Division Jack Richards had highest marks. Attendance in 1905 was remarkably broken. Of the staff, Miss Sangster is leaving after 41⁄2 years and Miss Vera Wilkinson intends to pursue her interests in science and will probably take her University Science course in 1906. This means a substantially new staff in 1906.

Editorial on The New Year

1905 was not marked nationally with any great event. Here we should look forward with hope. Commercially Burra has little prospect of prosperity. The harvest is fairly good and farmers’ incomes should be encouraging, but late frost damage reduced a very promising yield. There is little employment in the town. There were hopes that the mine might be in full swing, but this was not to be. This has been long promised and nothing has resulted. Residents have now lost hope and many are leaving as quickly as possible. The promise of a pumping plant has not yet been fulfilled. Some still believe the open cut at least will be unwatered and that a few men will find work there.

Burra School broke up on 21 December and a concert was given in the large room before a fair audience. Mrs J.C. Sandland distributed the prizes.

Burra Musical & Dramatic Club quite successfully staged a concert and the play Who is Who? on Boxing Night at the Institute.

Kooringa Methodist Church held a picnic at Sod Hut on Monday.

Rabbits. The drought has not reduced the rabbits yet. Mr E. Kickebusche of Baldina has netted four dams and caught 8,596 rabbits without noticeably lowering their numbers. Poison carts are busily at work.

The Salvation Army held special meetings over Christmas with dinners and teas and a lecture on phrenology.

New Year’s Eve saw few pranks, though someone lifted the turnstile off the bridge by the old Bible Christian Church. Some guns were fired at midnight and various churches held Watchnight Services.

The Holidays in Burra passed quietly. Christmas Day was very hot. On Boxing Day the United Friendly Societies Sports were held on the park.

The Annual Kooringa Methodist Church picnic was held on Monday at Sod Hut.

The crowd in the streets on Christmas Eve was smaller than in previous years, reflecting the smaller population. Juveniles made plenty of noise with trumpets etc. The old habit of decorating shop fronts with green boughs has almost died out and only two or three places continued it this year. Hotels did a good business, but patrons were well behaved and the police had practically nothing to do.

Redruth Court, recently

Charles Adams sued George Ford for £9-10-0 damages.

Ford conducted his own defence and his wife sat by and guided him, ‘but at times his superior knowledge of the law oozed from between his lips and he told the Court what they ought to do.’

Adams owned a block of land near Hampton fir 15 years. Ford put up a division fence, but it was evidently not enough to prevent them seeing each other. Ford bred superior fowls and got annoyed when Adams’ fowls entered his yard. When Ford took down the fence to repair his poultry yard some nine months ago Adams asked him to repair it and after no action sent Ford a second letter that had no more effect. Ford and his wife are illiterate and someone else had to read the letters to him. Ford also contended that Adams had erected a fowl yard using the post holes that Ford had dug. Other witnesses gave evidence and eventually a verdict for 40/- (£2) was given against the defendant. Ford narrowly escaped being charged with contempt of Court for his reaction and left defiantly vowing not to pay anything. [The case is reported at some length mainly because Mr Ford’s idiom was a source of amusement when reproduced in the paper.]

Obituary. J. Dowd [John Joseph] was killed at Whyte Yarcowie on 21 December 1905. He was helping to pull down an old two storey hotel, his former home. The workers had been camping in a small room in the building and a partition wall above it was to be pulled down. Mr Dowd said he wanted a drink before continuing and entered the small room. As he did so the wall fell into the small room and continued on taking out the floor and ending up in the cellar. Mr Dowd was completely buried in the debris and the body could not be extracted for some time. He was 48 and is survived by a widow and ten children.

Obituary. Honora O’Brien aged 67 died at her residence in Welsh Place on 30 December 1905. She was the wife of the late Daniel O’Brien. [Apparently neither born nor married in SA.]

Editorial. Hotel Permits

Following considerable discussion over the unreasonableness of the failure of the Mayor to allow extended trading hours for hotels over Christmas the editor prints the relevant section 61 of the Licensed Victualler’s Act No. 191 of 1880. This says that any two JPs, living within 10 miles of a hotel, can give such a permit, except that if the hotel lies within a corporate town one of them must be the Mayor. [Or a Special Magistrate or a Commissioner, Superintendent or Inspector of Police – none of whom reside within 10 miles of Burra.] The editor asks whether these criteria are fair. Another issue turned out to be that of whether the Mayor was a JP by virtue of his office. Section 62 makes it clear he was not, until properly sworn in. As Mr Drew had not been sworn in, he could not have given consent in any case.

W.J.M. Schultz of Black Springs was fined 2/6 + 10/- costs for failing to send his child to school as required.

Harry Austin noticed a large heap of manure in his father’s paddock had ignited and he called for assistance. It was soon extinguished, but had he not been so prompt the flames would have threatened 300 sheep and 400 bags of wheat in the paddock.

Weather. The past week has been the hottest in memory. From 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. there has been little relief with not a breath of wind. On four successive days temperatures were excessive and temperatures of 114°F in the shade were recorded.

Burra Burra Copper Co. Some very slight effort is being made to raise some ore, but there is really little activity at the mine. The pumping plant promised for mid-December has not yet appeared. Copper prices are high enough to induce some action, but nothing much is done. Some little development work has been done in shafts and about a dozen tributers are still at work. Hope is wearing out.

Miss Margaret Johnson has been committed to the Adelaide Lunatic Asylum.

Obituary. James Launder died at his residence on Friday morning aged 58. He leaves a widow and one step-son (Mr George Birt of WA). A severe attack of colic and other complications caused his death. He was Superintendent of the Methodist Sunday school, a member of the Town Council and Treasurer of the Kooringa Lodge of Freemasons. A mason by trade, he had built many houses in Burra. [Died 5 January.]

Obituary. Mr Edward Cox who had a harness making business at Redruth for many years died on Wednesday after a short illness. He was 56 and leaves a wife and five daughters & three sons: Miss E. Cox (Adelaide), Ida, Florrie, Gurtie & Isabel (Burra) and Herbert (Burra), Stanley (Broken Hill) & Clement (Adelaide). [Edward Cox died 4 January 1906 at Aberdeen. He appears to have been the Edward Cox born 11 October 1849 at North Adelaide.]

Council Vacancy. At 11 a.m. on Friday, not much more than an hour after Cr Launder’s death a candidate for his position came forward and started a vigorous canvas with the assurance he was first in the field and therefore entitled to the confidence and support of East Ward.

‘He was assured that there was not another individual in the town who would venture such a speculation until, at least, a few days had elapsed out of sympathy for the bereaved.’

[Though this person is never identified further, the tone of the writer and the nature of the action both suggest that it was most likely to have been W.H. Hardy.]

W. Heinrich thanks Fred Robertson Jnr for stopping a team of six horses on Tuesday. They had departed unasked from Roach’s Mill with the brake on and were stopped near the Post Office.

Editorial on the New Education Act. The Act now required children to attend school not less than 4 times a week if the school were open 6 times a week, or 6 times a week if it were open 8 times, or 8 times a week if it were open 10 times. (Mornings and afternoons were considered ‘times of opening’.) This applied only to the Electoral Districts of Adelaide, Pt Adelaide, Torrens and other Corporate Districts. This latter provision included Burra. Thee result was to increase compulsory attendance from 35 to 48 days each quarter.

A young son of F. Fradd drank some liniment last week and became drowsy before suffering a fit. Dr Sangster was called and after treatment the child is now out of danger.

Henry Bolton, third son of Mr E. Boulton, lately of Broken Hill, was poisoned when he drank some water from a creek at Mr Fred Dew’s where he was engaged in harvesting. Dr Sangster administered emetics and he recovered, though suffering considerably from a swollen face and annoying red pimples.

Robert Woollacott, fourth son of T.H. Woollacott of Redruth, gained honours in first year Chemistry and Geology at Broken Hill Technical College.

Obituary. Mrs Weaver, wife of Mr W. Weaver of Hallett, was taken ill with cancer about four months ago. She was treated at Burra Hospital to alleviate pain and subsequently moved to a residence in George St where she died on Saturday morning. She was 26 and leaves two small children. She was the second daughter of Mrs J. Hemmings and was born in Burra. She leaves two sisters and two brothers: Mrs Julius Voumard (Burra), Mrs Matthews (Hallett), Mr C.D. Hemmings (Lilydale) & Mr J. Hemmings (Bimbowrie). [Registration details are inconsistent. Born Emily Hemmings 30 May 1881. Married 1 November 1900 in Kooringa when year of birth given as 1879 and name as Emily Ellen Hemmings. Died 13 January 1906 at Kooringa, residence Hallett and name Emily Marie Weaver.]

Obituary. Mr John Kelly who carried on business for many years in the shop destroyed some time ago by fire in Commercial St has died. Since the disposal of his shop he has lived a retired life, but was in good health until one day last week when he had an apoplectic fit and died the same day aged 70. [Died 12 January 1906 at Kooringa.]

The late James Launder was remembered at a Lodge of Sorrow at the Masonic Hall in Kooringa on Sunday evening. Rev. S. Kessell also paid tribute to him at the Kooringa Methodist Church.

Rabbits are being killed in great numbers, but with no apparent impact on their population. Mr F.T. Jones of Mongolata recently netted a dam and on the first night caught 8, on the second 1,000 and on the third 700. For the week the total was 6,335. Others have reported catching 10,700 in a week and tolls of 3,000 to 4,000 are common. Rabbiters are averaging £4 a week and one £5. On the western side of the town numbers are fairly low, but men are still employed actively poisoning and digging out burrows.

J.M. McBride was ‘At Home’ on 12 January to celebrate his 75th birthday. Five sons and six daughters and their families responded from all over the state to the invitation to attend. A large picnic tent was erected with a table to seat almost 70. A sumptuous feast included a large birthday cake. The five sons and then the sons-in-law sat on his right and the six daughters and four-daughters-in-law sat after Mrs McBride to his left. 42 grandchildren were also seated.

Mr John Kemble of Baldina after farming there for many years left Burra on Tuesday en route to WA where he intends to take a farm. He will be missed in the district in all church matters.

Obituary. Mary Ann Heneker, wife of Mr T. [Thomas] Heneker of Whyte Yarcowie died on 4 January after a ten-year illness. She leaves a family of four sons and three daughters.

[Age on registration of apparent marriage is not quite consistent with that of 57 given for death, but she was probably born Mary Ann Murray.]

‘Constant’ writes complaining of C. Heinrich’s not being taken to court for keeping the Burra Hotel open on Boxing Day on the signature of two JPs when he should have known that the Mayor’s signature was required. He also thinks it unsatisfactory that the Mayor signed a permit for the Royal Exchange Hotel when not authorised to do so: though in this case the proprietor could not be expected to know that the Mayor had not been sworn as a JP. The legal situation needs sorting out.

Burra Burra Copper Co. It is stated on good authority that J.M. McBride offered to give the mine £5,000 and have an interest in the mine if the directors would only do their part, but even this did not have any effect on the management. [The words ‘give’ and ‘have an interest’ would need clarification before one could make a reasonable judgement about this.]

Nominations are called for the vacancy created by the death of Cr Launder.

A letter of condolence to be sent to Mrs Launder.

Editorial: Settlement on the Land

The writer is in favour of closer settlement and feels that the Government should be doing more to see people settled on land and making it more fruitful. If not by actually paying them then at least by giving cheap leases and assisting with setting-up costs of implements, clearing, fencing and the like.

The weather has been more congenial after a heatwave in which working horses were sunstruck and birds died by the score.

Municipal Election. The ratepayers responded to our call to keep undesirables out of the Council and unearthed a worthy candidate in Mr Alfred Bennetts. He was declared elected unopposed.

[While not provable, it is likely that the ‘undesirable’ candidate would have been W.H. Hardy in the eyes of the editor.]

Fire. Mr John Morgan of Baldina was driving home from Burra on Friday night and was near ‘Jilbert’s Well’ when a fire broke out in the back of his trap. A cloak, dress and other apparel were alight and in a high wind it was difficult to put out the flames. Mr Riggs came to his aid with water and extinguished the blaze. It is thought that a spark from a blacksmith’s shop must have smouldered until fanned into flame by the wind.

Burra Racing Club AGM was held on Friday at the Burra Institute. Mr A.B. Hiddle was in the chair. It was resolved to apply for 21 March for a meeting. There is a substantial credit balance in hand. W.H. Hardy was elected Secretary in place of W.T. Truscott who retired due to failing eyesight. Patron, Hon. J. Lewis MLC; President, Mr J. Tennant; Treasurer, W.T. Truscott. Stakes of £80 were arranged.

Clare Races on Wednesday were not as successful as in the past. Attendance was down and some of the most important races were poorly competed for. [Results are printed in column 5.]

Burra Burra Copper Co. Miners at Bunts’s Shaft made a remarkable discovery last week. At some 70ft they found a wheelbarrow that had been there about 35 years. It crumbled away when touched. Nearby milling ore was found.

Paull’s Mine. The new machinery has been erected. It is expected that the first run will be made at the end of February. Matt. May of smelts frame [sic: fame?] is on the job there, busy preparing cages, vanners etc. to deal with the ore that is said to be present in large quantity. Charley Fuss, metaphorically speaking is the daddy of local shareholders and a perfect idol amongst them. This is on account of his reliability and genuineness of purpose. ‘It is as good as a first in Tatt’s for them that he is a director, and having a swooping command in the venture takes great interest in it and looks after its welfare O.K.’

Alf Bennett’s election to Council eliminates objectionable fellows and those comprising the Council now are desirable [sic: desirous?] of harmony rather than dissention.

Pranksters recently cut the brush from the tails of Mr C. Heinrich’s two cows. Walter Truscott’s horse suffered a similar fate.

It came from a point between Bridge St East and Kingston St and lodged in the roof of an opposite house. Mr Bohme says he has private reasons for suspecting a particular person. The matter is being investigated by M-C Clarke, but in the absence of witnesses it will be a difficult matter to sheet the offence home.

Fanny Carbis, who was an inhabitant of the Redruth Reformatory about 12 months ago, took ill while there and was sent to the Burra Hospital. There she met Mr Fred Camp, who was also a patient. As a result the two were married and left the hospital, but a few days later she was arrested to complete her sentence. After some time she left Fred, having rifled the boxes of his deceased wife. She then lived quite reputably in the town for some time before going to Adelaide under the name Mrs Douglas, accompanied by a man. Last week she was sentenced to three months for having left her four month old child on the steps of the house of Mr R. McGee of Mercy St.

Burra Burra Copper Co.: The Burra Mine

After months of waiting the company has at last introduced a pump to unwater the open cut, but the concentrating plant has not appeared and is not likely to if the proposed scheme proves unsuccessful. Compared with the old pump at Morphett’s Shaft the one being erected now is a miniature. It is said to be capable of pumping 30,000 gallons an hour. A start is expected in about three weeks. The pump will be immediately on the water’s edge and the water will be carried to the small channel that leads to Burra Creek. Surprisingly the company has decided to suspend all tributing work. On Friday the tributers were told to expect no more work after the present ‘take’. The directors are to concentrate all efforts on the latest drive where excellent ore was discovered a few months ago. They propose a shaft with three shifts of workers and if they meet with success more will be done, but if they run into old workings (which we are assured will occur) it will be ‘as you were’. Apparently the idea of unwatering the open cut to set a number of pitches for tributers has been defeated. The men who have worked there for at least 20 years and who have returned thousands of pounds to the directors of SAMA [and to the BBCC?] feel aggrieved. One old miner said if tributing is taken away ‘it will spell ruination’ for the mine. Obviously the system would have to change as the open cut was unwatered, but arrangements could be made to use the water pumped from the open cut and work could have been found for 20 to 30 men. The scheme embarked upon does not suggest success for at least many months and putting down the shaft and other preliminary works will carry us well into 1907 and even then we will have to wait for the directors to say whether it is worth while entering into negotiations to develop the mine further. On the other hand unless ore is being raised the finances of the company will soon be exhausted. Surely this suggests that putting on as many tributers as possible could only help. Twenty men on tribute could pay the wages of those engaged in digging the shaft. At present the prospects are gloomy and unless the present cloud has a silver, or even a copper lining, no one need expect to see the Burra Mine any other than at present – practically dormant.

Rev. H.T.H. Wightwick has decided to accept a very good offer of a position in England. He will be much missed here where he has shown himself able to adapt himself to any topic, social or otherwise and his discourses are always interesting. He came to Australia about five years ago and first had charge of a church in Sydney and then in Pt Lincoln before coming to Burra about 18 months ago. So far as he knows he expects to leave for England at the end of March.

Whyte Yarcowie Methodist Church Harvest thanksgiving was held last Sunday.

Marriage. Wesley Bi-Centenary Church Hanson 14 February

Edward Arthur Albert Beckwith, fourth son of Mr J. Beckwith of Mt Bryan, married

Harriet Ann Dixon, fourth daughter of Mr George Dixon of Hanson

Golden Wedding of Mr & Mrs George Dixon of Hanson was celebrated on Wednesday 14 February with a tea at the Wesley Bi-centenary Church at Hanson. W.G. Hawkes was MC and told how Mr Dixon had carried out his duties at Koonoona Station under his supervision for 25 years, having been at the station for 41 years. The couple were presented with two purses of sovereigns and other presents. Mr Dixon was born at Bennefield in Northamptonshire in England on 2 August 1834 and Mrs Dixon at Chew Stoke in England 23 August 1835. They married at the parish church in Aberdare, Wales, 14 April 1856 and arrived in Adelaide on the Gomalza [Perhaps Gomaza: the print is unclear.] 12 June 1856 and came directly to Koonoona. There are four daughters and five sons: Mrs E. Williams (Farrell’s Flat), Mrs G. Taylor (Gawler), Mrs John Earle (Yongala), Mrs E.A. Beckwith (Belalie North), Mr John Dixon (Yongala), Messrs W.T. & R.J. Dixon (Hanson), Mr G.T. Dixon (Black Springs) & Arthur Dixon (Koonoona). There are 42 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren.

With the present price of copper good profits should be made. In the year 98 tons 10 cwt of concentrates had been sent away at an av. 18%. Hopes are that the machinery will be operational by mid-March.

G.E. Dane’s concert of combined Clare and Burra performers in the Institute on Wednesday evening drew a large attendance.

Joseph Parks (16) son of Charles Parks fell off a cart last week and the wheel passed over him just above the hip joint. He was not seriously hurt.

Burra Show for 1906 is scheduled for 26 September.

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. The tributers in the open cut are busy cleaning up their work which will cease about Saturday unless something unforseen occurs.

The directors seem to have killed the goose that laid the golden egg by not allowing tributers to work. The residents of Burra seem now to have lost all faith in them and the exodus of people has recommenced. Last week four left for Broken Hill and others will follow, though at present there is little prospect of work there either due to the recent fire.

W.E. Jordan, who is leaving the town, having disposed of his business, was farewelled at R.D. Pascoe’s hairdressing saloon [sic] and given a nice travelling bag, presented by the Mayor, John Drew.

[He was leaving due to the lack of business opportunities in the town.]

Mr W. Nelson was trapped almost to the waist in a couple of tons of rock fall in the quarry behind Victoria Park on Monday morning. One foot was bruised and a toe crushed, but he was soon extricated and sent to the Burra Hospital.

W. Pearce, 2nd son of William Pearce, is visiting on holiday from WA.

Edgar Pearce, 2nd son of John Pearce, is visiting on holiday from WA.

The Burra Mine. The Burra Burra Copper Co. The new pumping plant has been erected and should start operation during the next fortnight. The engineers have been quick at getting the plant together, especially as they had to move a couple of tons weight at a time with ropes, pulleys and rollers. Two steep embankments had to be negotiated with the last one leading to the water if any piece had got away. It is now said that when the water is lowered to the 50ft level a few men will be ‘set’ there. Others say that the water will be forked before the 40ft level. Some say test shafts will be sunk around the pool. The decision to stop all tributing came as a great surprise, as up to then it had been expected that on beginning pumping at least 30 men would be put on. Old hands that have been there years are now looking for other situations. Work at Bunts’s is progressing with not very gratifying results.

The Record reporter paid a visit to the mine and the reporter suggests that the Manager, Mr Pryor, was not very happy about the report in the paper the previous week. He said they were pumping out the water so why the gloomy response. He did not agree with the dire predictions attendant upon ceasing tributing work. The Record accused him of hugging the old works. Mr Pryor asked how he could get clear of them. The reporter suggested that if he had to answer that he would want Mr Pryor’s pay.

Residents are still leaving Burra for Broken hill and WA.

Scarlatina is very prevalent among children in Burra at present.

The late Mrs Charles Drew left £7,000 to various religious and charitable societies.

Jack Richards used his motor to tow a bike rider in 40 miles from the east last week.

[Probably both ‘motor’ and ‘bike’ here refer to motor cycles.]

A. & J. McDonald of Rockhill Farm at Leighton had the idea of cutting wheat when in a doughy state and allowing it to ripen in the straw with the intent of chaffing it and threshing it in the one operation. This was successfully done on 22 February and the experiment is reported in 2⁄3 column.

A. Abbot employed by A. Mann at Baldina had a toe crushed when a dam scoop suddenly overturned last week.

Rabbits are scarce at Baldina and Mongolata, but plentiful further east.

Miss A. Bernhardt was presented with a silver tray and tea set by the Girls’ Friendly Society at St Mary’s Hall on Friday. She was about to marry Alfred Walker.

Advt. Mrs Gebhardt of Mackerode was advertising for an Experienced General for Glenelg: no washing.

‘A Resident’ writes suggesting that the Special Magistrate should have dealt with such cases as recently brought under the Thistle Act which dates from 1862 and has had a number of Amending Acts. It is unfair to expect JPs to have to cope with such. Also the sitting day should not be a Monday, as when counsel is required from Adelaide they must come up on Saturday to be in Burra for court on Monday at 10 a.m.

VX, 717, 7 Mar. 1906, page 4

Salvation Army. Ensign Good conducted Harvest Thanksgiving services on Sunday and on Monday the Methodist Choir assisted.

Rev. H.T.H. Wightwick leaves for England on 12 April and will preach at St Mary’s for the last time on 1 April.

Burra & District Horticulture

Mr McKenzie at Lilydale has grown pumpkins measuring over 6’5” [presumably in circumference] and trombones 2ft to 4ft long and also sugar and water melons by the score along with other vegetables and a fine crop of tomatoes.

At Glenora (Radford’s) there are good fruit trees and grapes with bunches up to 6 & 7lbs.

Redruth has had special services at the Mission Tent for the past two or three weeks.

Paull’s Mine held its half-yearly meeting which was attended by C. Fuss and J. McDonald. When local buyers got into the market shares were £8. They then rose to £15-10-0 before falling to £4-10-0. Good reports from the mine have seen a rise in value and sales on Saturday in Adelaide were at £13.

E.W. Crewes has returned from a holiday in Sydney.

Rev. Fr Redden has returned from two months holiday in the South East and is looking well.

Court.

Thomas Woollacott was fined £1 for five stray horses in Best Place.

Harry Goodwin was fined 10/- for two stray horses in Best Place.

Weather. Fine rains last week were welcome and extended well to the east. Just over the hills about 2 inches fell in an hour, doing damage as well as good. To the east Braemar had 60-70 points; Faraway Hill got 80 and Lilydale 110 points. There were good falls along the peg-line.

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. Tributing work ceased on Saturday. Pumping out of the open cut should begin in about two weeks.

‘Interested’ writes re the Burra Mine

Having read the Record’s report and its gloomy outlook ‘Interested’ wrote to a friend to see if the paper had overdrawn the case, but was told it was much underdrawn. He came therefore to Burra to judge for himself and was surprised to see the town such a dull place. A weekday in the shopping area looked like a Sunday. He knew the mine was being worked in a small way, but any smaller and he would not have found anyone there at all. It is a disgrace that it has taken five years to do so little. He called it pig-rooting not mining. The stopping of the tributers is one of the biggest mistakes possible. They are the mainstay of the mine. Talk of the difficulty of pumping out the open cut is tommy rot. He then goes on to speculate on the possible richness of ore to be discovered when the water is lowered.

Weather. Eastern Country rains. Falls are listed for 15 places and most range from 70 at Woolgangi to 165 points at Baldina, but Oakbank with 13, Quondong 50 and Pine Valley 40 were lower.

Burra Town Council, Monday

Council cannot see its way clear to erect a lamp in Chapel St.

Five chains of kerbing will be done in Quarry St.

Other matters were of a routine nature.

Mr Hemmerling lost 15 turkeys last week – presumably to a fox.

Advt. Mrs Gray of Redruth is supporting herself and children and will take in sewing, mending and darning.

Advt. Mr A. Bartholomaeus of Kooringa has for sale a 10-ton weighbridge.

VX, 718, 14 Mar. 1906, page 4

W. Barkley has removed from the shop known as Dobbies to that lately occupied by W.E. Jordan in Market Square.

Dry bible is prevalent in the area now and has caused the death of several cows.

The Burra Hotel Footbridge is in a dangerous state and we draw the Councils attention to it. The footboards are hardly safe for the traffic and the side rails are broken.

Salvation Army. Ensign Good, who has had charge of the local corps for 14 months has been transferred and will be given a farewell on 18 March. He came when there was dissension in the ranks and has been able to raise the tone.

Burra Races next Wednesday.

The Elder Claim is being developed south of Princess Royal and the shaft is down 150’ with a 90’ drive. Indications are good for an ore strike soon.

Dutton’s Troughs Claim is not being worked though copper is believed to be there in payable quantities.

The Eastern Mining & Prospecting Syndicate claim 15 miles east of Burra has been stopped by lack of water, but resumption is hoped for soon. [Is this the same claim that was 32 miles east in VX, 714, 14 Feb. 1906, page 5, or do they have more than one claim?]

The Rev. Humphrey T.H. Wightwick, [Rector of St Mary’s 1904-06] is preparing to return to the UK.

Iron Mine Sports last Wednesday were contested in poor weather with rain after 11 a.m. Results are printed.

VX, 718, 14 Mar. 1906, page 5

The Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. The tributers have ceased to work in the open cut. A visit on Monday found the place almost deserted, but for one man. The pumping machinery is not yet ready to work. It is not known how long it will take to pump out, but it is hoped to start within a fortnight. It is expected some 30,000 gallons an hour will flow down the creek and it is the intention of some men to be allowed to fossick in the creek.

[The tone of the whole report is one of extreme scepticism.]

‘Boulder Block WA’ writes about the Burra Mine asking why the directors do not go in for thorough development of the mine instead of merely allowing tributers to get at stuff known to exist around the open cut. The mine should, he says, be drained to the 100 fathom level of Morphett’s Shaft and Grave’s Shaft be sunk to the same level.

Salvation Army. Ensign and Mrs Good thank their friends and sympathisers for their good time in Burra over about the last 15 months.

‘Abomah’ & her company showed at Burra on Wednesday to a fair house.

Albert Ward will soon leave Burra.

The Institute: there is a move to lay on acetylene gas.

Weather. More rain in the last week saw Oakbank get 125 points and Balah 115. Again it was very patchy in the east with falls varying from 10 to 125 points.

Court.

D.R. Jones, labourer of Redruth, was fined a total of £3 for not sending his children to school as required. The JPs felt he was unfairly dealt with by the Education Department which had waited nearly six months to bring the case, during which time the children had been attending regularly. They could not reduce the penalty, but waived hearing fees.

VX, 719, 21 Mar. 1906, page 4

Advt. To Let: the Court House Hotel of 17 rooms, stables etc. for a term of three or more years from 3 May 1906.

Ralph Giles who has been clerk of the Redruth Court for some time has been transferred to Pt Augusta, which is a promotion. Mr Olson, the new clerk, arrives today.

Salvation Army. Ensign & Mrs Good leave for Wallaroo tomorrow to be succeeded ‘by two lassies’ Captain Coombes and Lieut. Crocker from Melbourne who are due on 28 March.

Star Thistles. The writer complains that a recent £2 fine is absurd and should have been £50. If Mr Laidlaw and Mr C. Bowman can keep their large runs free of it then others can too, or they should be made to forfeit the land for closer settlement.

Rev. H.T.H. Wightwick is having W.J. Davey make lantern slides of his many pictures of Burra and District. He has a very nice collection.

Fire. A fire started close to Mr W.I. Short’s garden on Monday afternoon and several acres of grass and some fencing were destroyed. Fortunately Mr Short was present and with difficulty got the fire under control. The west wind fortunately saved Mr R. Austin’s stubble paddock. Mr Short lost the best part of his grass feed and several fruit trees were badly damaged. Mrs Short managed to secure the haystack in the garden.

Burra Races will be held today in a paddock near Copperhouse lent by Mr Finch.

‘Shareholder’ writes re the Burra Mine

He was glad to see the paper reminding the directors of their duty. The Government lent a diamond drill on the understanding that if anything was found the company would work the mine. In each of two bores sulphide ore was discovered, but nothing followed. Then a pumping plant was offered from Sliding Rock if directors would promise to do their bit, but again there was no result.

Now there is a pumping plant being erected, but still no plant to treat ore. With copper at £80 a ton and up-to-date machinery and the costs of carriage for coal so much less than when the mine was operating something should be possible.

‘Sanitary’ hopes the new scavenger will come more than one a year.

Whyte Yarcowie Races. The annual meeting was held last Wednesday and the results are printed.

VX, 719, 21 Mar. 1906, page 5

Cricket. At Victoria Park on Saturday:

Burra 7 for 244 declared. I. Macindoe 61 retired, F.T. Harcus 70 retired, Hartnett 25 retired & Jones 51 retired.

Farrell’s Flat only batted 7 men and scored 6 for 68.

[The paper says six men, but there were six out.]

Farrell’s Flat Sports. The Annual Sports and Horse Racing was held on Wednesday last in lieu of St Patrick’s Day. Attendance was unusually small. Results are printed.

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. Some work continues, but any hope of success is meagre. Some ore has been struck in the drive and work is now directed to the westerly direction. A few months ago Mr Jack Sanders probably one of the oldest miners in the town worked up to a patch of ore he knew was resting there when the mines stopped and he succeeded in cutting a nice lode from a tributer’s point of view and should, from our observations, have made a decent wage for the best part of the take.

Mr Thomas Drew, one of the directors, was in Burra from Saturday and left on Tuesday morning. He inspected the mine and admitted that little work had been done. He himself is not cheerful and says that if the property cannot be disposed of fairly soon they will have to stop.

We have said that the funds of the present company will run out and it will be useless for them to make a call, for not one in a hundred would respond. The property would fall back into the hands of the directors and the tide is drifting that way. Work on the pumping plant has stopped because the lifts for the pumps have not arrived and will not come till some time in April.

[Personal interest: the Jack Sanders mentioned above is almost certainly my great-grandfather John Sanders of Copperhouse.]

Mr Laidlaw, manager of Alex Murray’s estate, recently caught three foxes and showed them to the Mt Bryan schoolchildren, many of whom had never seen one before.

Petherton Settlers are busy setting up their homes with sheds & houses and dams are being sunk. This closer settlement will make a big difference to Mt Bryan.

Maurice Collins gashed his leg with an axe while cutting wood last week.

Kooringa Football Club met in R.D. Pascoe’s room on Monday and elected: Secretary, J. Allen; Captain, J.A. Knevett; Vice-Captain, N. Pearce.

Burra Town Council, Monday

Ramblers Football Club was granted use of Victoria Park on the usual terms.

Other items were of a routine nature.

Paull’s Mine. Mr E. Pryor has been appointed underground manager. He was in old days a timberman in the Burra Mine and for years has been foreman timberman at Broken Hill. He will give good value for money.

Mr Joseph Phillips of Waterloo has been admitted to Burra Hospital with gangrene of the toe and diabetes. He was formerly a blacksmith, but latterly a farmer. He is the father-in-law of Mr F. Harris and Mrs Ensign Aberg of Broken Hill. [See obituary next issue.]

Burra Institute has appointed a committee comprising Messrs [C.A.] Fuss, Winnall, Hague, Drew & Dr Sangster Jnr to enquire into the installation of acetylene gas.

VX, 720, 28 Mar. 1906, page 4

Rain. We received 97 points last weekend.

Paull’s Mine concentration plant is now ready and will probably begin this week. Mr C.A. Fuss, one of the local directors, will go to the mine on Monday to see the results and report to directors and shareholders.

Salvation Army. The two new lady officers, Captain Coombes and Lieut. Crocker, arrived unexpectedly on Friday and conducted their first open-air service on Saturday. Ensign and Mrs Good left Burra on Thursday morning and will succeed Captain Ross who did not leave a favourable impression behind him when he left Burra.

Burra Amusement & Dramatic Club presented a concert at the Burra Hospital last week. Musical items were followed by the farce Supper for Two.

Obituary. Joseph Phillips died on Monday from complications and shock following an operation on gangrene of a toe as a result of diabetes. He arrived in SA in 1850 and found employment at Mintaro and for the last 42 years was a resident of Waterloo. He leaves a widow and five daughters and five sons:

Mrs F. Harris (Burra) Mrs R. Holland (Birkenhead)

Mrs Ensign Aberg (Broken Hill) Mrs A.J. Farley (Chicago USA)

Nellie (Waterloo) James (Waterloo)

Bert (Waterloo) Phillip (Burra)

Edwin (Pengelly WA) William (Pengelly WA)

There are 22 grandchildren.

[Died 26 March aged 72 at Kooringa, residence Waterloo.]

VX, 720, 28 Mar. 1906, page 4-5

Burra Races last Wednesday were very successful and a credit to the officials, especially to the secretary, Billy Hardy. They were held in Ted Finch’s paddock and a profit over £40 will result. Last year the old club was resuscitated with some difficulty and a loss of £5 resulted. This time there was a large attendance. The main race was the Burra Handicap which paid £16 for 1st and was won by M.F. O’Dea’s Curate, which also won the Welter Handicap.

In the selling Hack Race, Mason, riding Miss N.M. O’Dea’s The Blackhawk pulled up most obviously to allow Mr A.T. Fairchild’s Honeyboy, ridden by Williams, to win. The Blackhawk was disqualified and Mason has been banned from racing for 12 months.

The writer of the report wondered why so many police were at the track with such light work for them there, and why they didn’t stop the illegal betting that was going on.

VX, 720, 28 Mar. 1906, page 5

D. (‘Dud’) B. Fleming has left the town after a disagreement with the management of Drew & Crewes, though the matter was eventually sorted out by his father acting as his solicitor.

Dicky Burns, publican of the Royal Exchange hotel, has left for Adelaide after 6 years - apparently his application for renewal of licence was turned down and Mr Naylon from Manoora will take over.

Ralph Lonsdale Giles, late clerk of the Redruth Court, has left Burra for Pt Augusta, which represents a substantial promotion.

Rev. Wightwick managed to photograph the last two ex-tributers still at work on some ore bearing stuff at the mine - Tom Kellaway and his son Stan. [Then c. 21 years old.]

Tom has worked there for many years and his five sons have all struggled for an existence on the property. Tom ‘worked there when it stopped, and have worked there ever since, and have seen almost every movement of the ground’. He will now be seen in England on the screen on a lanternslide.

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. The best we can learn is that there is no fixed policy decision about the action when the water is pumped from the pool. The pump is still idle. Mr Pryor says shafts will be put down near the water’s edge and if ore is struck it will assist the directors in making a decision. There is not enough cash to go on much longer. The pumping house has been closed for three weeks. Pumping, it was said, would begin last December, but only a little has been done. We do not condemn the mine which we believe is one of the best, but the method in which it is being worked.

Phosphate Fields. Work at the fields some 15 miles east of Burra has been suspended for about three months due to difficulties in finding a purchaser for the product.

VX, 721, 4 Apr. 1906, page 4

Hanson School Concert tonight organised by head teacher Mr Bray to aid school funds.

St Mary’s. Rev. H.T.H. Wightwick preached for the last time at Burra on Sunday and left the town on Tuesday afternoon. Rev. Ebbey [sic: error for Ebbs] from Broken Hill will follow him at Burra.

Paull’s Mine. After considerable delay in setting up the machinery it is expected to start operation today. There is plenty of ore in reserve in different drives and arrangements will be made to run three shifts when 750 tons will be treated weekly. Mr C.A. Fuss left Burra on Monday to meet the new manager Mr E. Pryor at Petersburg and they travelled on together.

W.R. Ridgway writes to say the ‘Dicky’ Burns was not unfairly treated on leaving the Royal Exchange Hotel and might have gone on there for another six years if he had chosen.

The editor comments that Burns’s evidence is a direct denial of this.

Accident. Last Saturday Harry Baynes was cycling in from Mongolata. He met Mr Isaac Villis near the Baldina Creek and soon after travelling at 20 m.p.h. his machine completely collapsed and he was thrown along the ground for 10-15 yards. He suffered severe bruising and abrasions and was rendered unconscious. Mr Villis assisted his recovery and Baynes then insisted he was alright to walk into Burra. He did so, pushing the bike by its back wheel (all that was salvageable) and arrived exhausted.

Mr Hassel, who had enquired of the Town Council about the strength of the town bridges to carry a traction engine and loads of phosphate rock, has not been seen for some time and no work is being done on the claims that he somehow got hold of. A letter has been sent to the Minister of Mines and if he does not carry out the requirements to work the claim the leases will again be open for selection.

Rev. Wightwick’s sale went surprisingly well. He got more for his horses than he paid for then after getting about two years’ hard work out of them. The sale realised £280-£300.

Redruth Court, 3 April

The following were charged with being idle and disorderly:

John McGuire & Joseph Lund: sentenced to 14 days in jail.

Joseph Dennis & Henry McDonald sentenced to 1 month in jail.

Obituary. R.Z. Jones has died aged 81. He was a schoolteacher at Stony Gap for a number of years and later lived in a house now almost demolished in Commercial St. He moved to Adelaide and then to Jamestown, where he lived with his son. Mrs Jones died some eight years ago. John, the youngest son, served his time as a printer at the Burra Record and is now in WA.

He has been secretary to numerous dances and was a most efficient master-of-ceremonies.

Burra Town Council held a special meeting on 26 March and decided to take no action concerning the purchase of the slaughterhouse to be auctioned during April. An ordinary meeting on Monday conducted routine business.

Accident. Two horses attached to Mt Tom Halls’ cab became fractious at the station and after some interaction with Edwin Harris’s horse and dray they brought the cab into contact with the corner fence post damaging the cab considerably.

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co.

A large belt wheel was cracked when it fell off the trolly because the horses moved and it had to be repaired at Henderson’s. On Saturday the first run of the engine was made and it worked silently and beautifully. We expect the bottom of the pool to be exposed at about 20ft. Pumping should begin in about three weeks. When we [Mr Davey] visited the Mine Mr Pryor ordered us away from the site and refused to talk to us. But if we did not go to the Mine to see for ourselves the shareholders would have to rely on the information released by Mr Pryor and would not know the true state of affairs. At present there is nothing showing that gives promise of anything valuable from a mineral point of view. Work at Bunts’s Shaft continues and the intention of management is to get below the old workings.

F. Treloar left Burra on 27 February on a trip to WA. He had a good trip and feels much benefited by the holiday. He was interviewed about WA and gives his impressions in an article of about 1⁄2 column. He felt that anyone from here contemplating taking up farming there should go and have a look first because the land was very different from here.

A Race of Sorts!

There is a humorous account of a race held at Finch’s paddock between A. Moore’s Dick and Mr Ward’s Honeyboy. There is a lot of humorous discussion about the antics in getting to the starting line. At the start Honeyboy tossed its rider and headed for home. Dick meanwhile got off to a confused start, but eventually ran the mile in 61⁄2 minutes and won, having galloped a while, then cantered and finally trotted home. Eventually when the laughter subsided the race was restarted and this time they both got away, but once again Dick won easily.

Accident. On Saturday last Mr Allen, on going to H. Roach’s Flour Mill missed the stallion Bellatrix from the stable. The horse was found, having fallen into an underground tank whose roof had fallen in. Tom Vivian got to the site before Mr Roach and set to work to get the horse out. Slings were arranged and the tank bailed out till it got down to 4’6”. By then a winch and ropes and pulleys were procured. When it was ten months old Mr Roach had practically sold the horse for £100, but reneged on the deal and now it is 21⁄2 would not sell him for £250. He is a fine horse 15.3 high. Much of the credit for the successful rescue goes to the quick and effective work of Tom Vivian.

Obituary. Mrs Stewart, wife of Mr W.A. Stewart and eldest daughter of the late B. Preece, died at Aberdeen on Saturday [21 April] aged 54. She was born in Hereford England and came to SA about 52 years ago with her parents. She has been associated with Burra most of her life. Mr & Mrs Stewart were connected with the White Hart Hotel in the 1870s and later with the Bon Accord which was built by Mr Stewart’s father. In 1882 Mr Stewart, in consequence of his wife’s ill health, moved to Port Victor for some years. They later returned to run the Royal Exchange Hotel in Burra and later still went to Petersburg, Glenelg, Murray Bridge and Beaconsfield, Victoria. Some six months ago Mrs Stewart became seriously ill and underwent a successful operation in Adelaide. She decided to return to her people in Burra, but the malady returned and she gradually sank until her death on Saturday. She leaves a husband and six children: Mrs Jack Phelp [sic: Philp], Mrs J. Heithersay (Petersburg), William Stewart (Hamley Bridge), Douglas Stewart (Riverton) & Miss Greta and Gordon (Beaconsfield). There are also two sisters and eight brothers. [Born Harriet Preece.]

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Company: Ninth Half-yearly Report

There is £2,988-19-5 more to spend. For the half year 271⁄2 tons of ore sold for £371-10-2 for a loss of £188-18-5. There are 50,000 unallotted shares.

The editor observes that the Tributers contributed £41-0-1 and it is a wonder they were not encouraged to do more. He also observes that the remaining shares if allotted at 10/- each could raise a further £25,000. [This of course supposed that investors could be found.]

The editor says he visited the mine on Monday and Mr Pryor wanted to know who had given him permission to be there. He claimed the right as a shareholder. He inspected the engine and engine house and found the pumping to be going smoothly. A couple of tributers were using the water to treat hitherto useless stuff. He then reports that Mt James S. Pryor has sent the editor a letter informing him that he is not allowed on the mine property without permission and if he persists he will be prosecuted for trespass, menacing and using threatening language to the company’s manager. He says that is nonsense because all the threatening language has come from Mr Pryor’s side. He continues to assert that the paper has told the public more than Mr Pryor wants them to know, but not to aggravate, but to induce those who were responsible for the delays to proceed with the development in a proper manner. The old works must be got under to discover something better than has so far been found.

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. Water is flowing down the Burra Creek in a gentle stream from the mine pump.

Burra Mine: The Burra Burra Copper Co.

Pumping operations have been suspended. There was not 50ft of water in the pool and we have been proved correct when we said the bottom would be reached before 23ft of water had been pumped out. Slush is causing trouble for the pump. The contractors say they were engaged to pump and will not undertake to dig a shaft in the centre of the pool to enable the water to be lowered below the 50ft level. It is just as well to have stopped now, as the management have no fixed policy to carry out and to drive anywhere without getting under the old workings displays no ingenuity or knowledge of mining in Burra. One thing that could be done is to pump from Graves’ Shaft, but we think it best to dispose of the company at once and not disappoint shareholders further. Tributers who fixed their jigs on the embankment at considerable trouble have had to abandon them on account of the suspension of pumping operations.

‘They Say’

Editorial on the death of Doris May Saxon under suspicious circumstances.

An Accident occurred near Messrs Elder, Smith & Co.’s paddock, north of the railway station, on Saturday when Mr C.B. Warnes’s car frightened the horse in Mrs Hoffman’s trap. The horse ran into a fence and the trap was upset. Mrs Hoffman received several scratches and a little girl was shaken. One of the shafts was broken. Mr Warnes stopped and rendered all possible assistance.

Paull’s Mine has sent away 15 tons of ore in the last few days and several months’ supply has been disclosed. The ‘satisfactory state of affairs are mainly due to Mr C. Fuss’. Mr Ned Pryor, the underground manager is doing a very good job.

Obituary and Inquest on the body of Doris May Saxon, aged c. 14 weeks.

The inquest was conducted at the Royal Exchange Hotel, Aberdeen, on Saturday. P.L. Killicoat was coroner and W. Neville was foreman of the jury.

Dr Sangster Sen. had attended the child, but refused a death certificate, being unsure of the cause of death and also ‘in consequence of certain reports which I heard as to the care of the child’. The post mortem showed the baby weighed 81⁄4 lb, had no signs of violence and an unusual absence of fatty tissue with pale muscles. Believed the cause of death was marasmus accelerated by diarrhoea. [i.e. wasting away due generally to malnutrition.]

Mary Lepley, wife of J. Lepley of Redruth had fostered the child from Mrs Graves of Adelaide and was paid £18 for keeping it forever. She had the child 13 weeks. The child started to fail two weeks ago. Mary Lepley had got the child to clear herself of debts and had done so before - three weeks before Christmas - but had passed that child on to a better home. On that occasion she had got £15. The earlier child had been registered as Louisa Lepley. Mary Sleeman gave evidence that the child had been well cared for. The verdict agreed with Dr Sangster’s conclusions.

[Doris Mary Saxon born 20 January 1906 to Myra Saxon at East Adelaide: died 4 May 1906 at Redruth.]

‘Shareholder’ writes that as the Record’s estimate of only 20’ of water in the open cut has now been proved correct, the best place for a shaft is in the southeast corner where there is known to be an ore body and a shaft of at least 60ft would allow for its exploitation as well as draining the mine.

The rain has not continued and grass after the last rain has now perished. The eastern country is very poor with lambing now upon us. In some places lambs have had to be destroyed to save the ewes.

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. A solar [i.e. a platform] is to be put lower down in Graves’ Shaft and as soon as completed driving will commence. The drive where a lot of money has already been spent is not giving good results and the grade there won’t pay. The pump is having trouble which is believed to be due to the slush being worked up. The inrush of water below 10 or 12ft is considerable and it is not yet known if the pump will cope with it, but so far the indications are positive. On going to press we learn the Graves’ Engine Shaft operation has been suspended on account of one miner going away, yet capable men are on hand to do the work.

The mine pool level has fallen 8-10ft.

Divorce. Elizabeth Hancock asked for the dissolution of her marriage to Henry Thomas Hancock on account of cruelty and misconduct. They were married at Redruth in 1879 and had six children. She gave evidence of severe assaults in 1899 & 1901 when his ill treatment compelled her to leave the house. She also alleged misconduct with a woman at the respondent’s house. As a result of the mistreatment she said she was blind in one eye. The judge said he would report to the Full Court that the allegations of adultery and misconduct had been proved.

[Actually according to the registration data Elizabeth Esau/Esaw/Easaw married Henry Thomas Hancock on 1 January 1879 at the residence of William Hancock, the groom’s father, at Broughton. There were five sons and one daughter born either at North Adelaide or the Clare Valley and also he had a son by Ellen Thrush at North Adelaide in 1904. Since Elizabeth was born at Riverton in 1853 there is no clear Burra connection without further information.]

Opals. Mr Fitzpatrick an expert who knows White Cliffs and Queensland opal fields has given a high opinion of the area at Millerton where opal was found a couple of years ago. On the strength of this a new local syndicate is being formed to develop claims there.

The Burra Mine: The Burra Burra Copper Co.

A decision has been made to get samples from various parts of the mine with the object of refloating the property, but this has been done before and is futile unless exploration gets below the old workings.

Since the water level was lowered 9 or 10ft an old drive has been exposed and found to contain some ore, but it was abandoned long before the mine closed and the presence of ore does not mean it will repay working expenses.

In the past week the pump has had several good runs, but it has stopped on several occasions, as muck is being disturbed at about 12ft. It is a pity the level has not been lowered 50ft or even 25ft as that would make all the difference. We believe nothing can be done until sufficient capital is found for systematic development. We would not alter our opinion if all the unallotted shares were showered upon us. An attempt to find sulphide ore is to be made from Allen’s Shaft as we had earlier suggested.

Mrs G. Dow, wife of G. Dow, the popular relieving telegraph operator, died following an operation for cancer in the throat. She was 32. She was in fact entirely responsible for the prizes won at numerous flower shows under the name of her father Mr C. Oppermann. Her displays were the greatest attraction of the shows. She was also noted for her fruit displays. She was a sister of Mrs E.A. Topperwein and Amelia of Parkside also William, Albert and Charles of Burra.

The late Mrs Dow complained of a throat affection last September and it was first thought to be the result of a severe cold, but was later discovered to be a growth. Eminent city physicians said it was a most unusual case with the growth right in the larynx. An operation never before attempted was performed about three weeks ago. In spite of the seriousness of the operation the patient rallied and was bright and hopeful. After a while the illness had to receive further treatment and even then she did not suffer a collapse. The case was watched with keen interest by medical men, but on Thursday news was received of her sudden death and on Friday she was buried at Kooringa. 30-40 traps formed the cortege and members of the Lily of the Valley Tent IOR marched in front of the hearse. Sister A. Snell read a Rechabite service at the graveside. Rev. Ebbs conducted the church service. Mrs Dow had taken a prominent part in church matters, especially in the annual strawberry fete.

For many years the Burra Horticultural Society had benefited by the contribution of the Oppermann family to shows and though the prizes were in the name of Mr C. Oppermann, the late Mrs Dow was entirely responsible for the unqualified success of her father’s exhibits, for to her the growing, arranging and staging was confidently left. How well she accomplished her work is still fresh in the minds of all lovers of flowers in the district. Her displays were invariably the greatest attraction of the show, containing as they did designs novel and unique in addition to an array of beautiful colours that blended admirably together. Her successes ranged from the miniature buttonhole to giant chrysanthemums.

Court.

Much of the page is devoted to reporting the case of Jack Gray who was accused of stealing a pair of boots. The case is remarkable for the sloppy prosecution and the manner in which the bench appears to have accepted doubtful evidence. Later evidence suggests the charge was utterly wrong and that even if Gray was guilty of something it wasn’t what he was charged with. It all reads like a botched job, but in any event he got two months. He was charged with stealing a pair of boots from M. Pederson, but it became clear that they had actually been taken from Kelly’s trap in Aberdeen. He should have been charged with being in possession of items reasonably believed to have been stolen. The report of the court hearing extends for 21⁄3 columns and there is a further 1⁄2 column of editorial comment reflecting on the inept way the case was handled by the policeman, M-C Clarke. The writer concludes that the bench would have been quite correct to have dismissed the case.

Accident. Mr J. Nelson was thrown from his dogcart about 3-4 miles east of Burra on Saturday night when one wheel passed over a load of road metal. While he was attempting to calm the struggling and fallen horse it kicked him above the eye and inflicted a nasty wound. Fortunately he and the horse were rescued by two passers-by and Nelson was brought into Burra for medical attention.

Advt. An Address on Current Politics will be given at the Institute on 8 June by the Hon. L. O’Loughlin, Commissioner of Crown Lands and C. Goode MP.

[This advt. was corrected in 13 June issue to show that they were actually at Farrell’s Flat that night.]

‘They Say’

Rev. James the hypocritical parson who fled Perth recently took with him on his journey from Melbourne a servant Annie Kindred aged 25 or 26.

The person or persons who poured kerosene on the rear part of that faithful animal and set alight to it ought to be tar and feathered. [sic] [See further at the court case, next issue page 4.]

Pumping at the mine is affecting the depth of water in the well from which is obtained the town supply.

The Mayor deserves a pat on the back for supplying 25 prizes for juveniles on Empire Day.

Redruth Court House is being repaired: plaster ceilings are being replaced where necessary with small corrugated iron. Spoutings have been cleaned out and repaired.

Burra District Council is offering 5/- per head for foxes. Several District Councils are offering 10/-. One was seen at Springbank on Friday - probably the same one that was seen at Shafton on Saturday.

Mr Williams is to re-open the shaft near Millerton and deepen it to see if prospects warrant a drive to be dug for opals. Present funds are limited, but should be enough to double the present depth.

Itinerants. Most of the ‘Weary Willies’ have taken the hint and moved on.

Court.

Francis Ford and Arthur Collins have been charged on the information of T.P. Halls jun. with cruelly torturing and injuring a greyhound, the property of Halls, on 4 May. He claimed £5 compensation. [The allegation was that they poured kerosene over the dog and set it alight.] Due to the illness of Collins the case was adjourned for one month.

Burra Town Council.

A letter from the Commissioner of Crown Lands advises that the pumping at the mine is likely to lead to all wells at a higher level than the depth reached by pumping, going dry.

Young St Ford is to be paved with stones 12ft wide the full width of the road.

The Farewell to J. Lane is reported in detail over 11⁄2 columns. He had been postmaster at Kooringa for 25 years. He was a very active participant in the Methodist Church for that period. Speeches are reported from: J. Drew, the Mayor

S. Burns: Mr Lane had been the backbone of the movement to establish the World’s End Church and in former years had been a great help to the Bible Christian Church.

Mr Crewes said he and Mr Lane were the two oldest local preachers on the plan.

Mr Pryor, Rev. S. Kessell, Dr Sangster Sen., Rev. Father Redden.

Mr Lane reflected on his contribution to the Hanson, World’s End and Leighton Churches and thanked all friends for his presentation.

The Martindale [Gold] Sluicing Co. formed in Kooringa has tested the ground at Martindale and hopes to work on sections 2153 and 2154.

Paull’s Mine’s new engineer is Mr Stokes.

Football at Victoria Park on Wednesday: Burra 2.5 (17) defeated Broken Hill 2.3 (15).

On Saturday at Victoria Park: Ramblers 6.15 (51) defeated Aberdeen 3.6 (24).

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. The present directors will clearly not work the mine to any good account. Before the present owners acquired the mine Messrs Martin & Co. made a good offer to the old owners, but for some reason it was not accepted. Messrs Martin & Co. then offered the present directors to work the mine on tribute and pay 121⁄2% to the owners, but this too was not accepted. Martins also offered to unwater the mine and to keep it dry for twelve months and hand the machinery over after that, but the price for that was also unacceptable. Nothing much is doing at the site and we note the promoters’ shares are on the move which does not augur well. With a favourable opportunity at Morphett’s Shaft it is hoped lives will not be risked in the proposed shaft [in the open cut].

Female Fisticuffs. There are oblique references in a paragraph reporting that Burra has at least three or four ‘women pugilists who seem to have met on ‘Charley Grow’s Bridge’.

[No doubt their identities were well known at the time. The bridge would be the one in Ayers St.]

VX, 732, 20 June 1906, page 4

Weather. Steady rain this week was one of the best falls for the year. 117 points fell in Kooringa, but very little fell to the east.

The Opal Fields. The Burra DC has assented to the re-opening of the shaft near Millerton. Mr W.J. Williams is deepening it and samples similar to those previously discovered have been uncovered. A cemented layer of rock is now being removed which is believed by experts to be a good sign.

Paull’s Mine is said to be going fairly well and the new general manager Mr Stokes will take charge in a few days.

‘The Corricks’ will perform at the Institute next Tuesday and Wednesday. There are ten artists: vocalists, instrumentalists, bellringers, dancers and humorists. Also the performance features Lennards English Biograph Co. [Moving pictures.]

Marriage. 13 June in WA

Albert Opie AIA son of Edward Opie, who years ago kept the hotel at Aberdeen named after his grandfather, and grandson of James Tiver, married Miss Mary Young.

Mr Opie was born in Burra, but has spent much of his life at Broken Hill and in WA and is presently clerk at the Golden Horseshoe Mine.

Henry Charles Rainsford Batchelor, eldest son of the late W.H. Batchelor of Kooringa, has been appointed Deputy Examiner of Trademarks in the Commonwealth Patent Office in Melbourne. He was educated at his uncle F.R. White’s Commercial College in Kooringa and then at Glenelg Grammar School before joining the SA civil service as a cadet with the Marine Board in 1880. In 1884 he married Amy Dempster the daughter of a Pt Adelaide solicitor J.E. Dempster. Their eldest daughter is at Adelaide University and their second has an appointment at the School of Mines as a cadet.

[The article gives details of his rise through the civil service and through the militia infantry where he rose to be the senior captain in the SA Infantry.]

Burra Mine: Burra Burra Copper Co. Two or three additional tributers have started work. One of them unearthed a nice show of sulphide ore last week a couple of feet above the present water level and about 13ft below the level before pumping began.

Driving continues from Allen’s Shaft, but with no results.

There has been no further action on a shaft in the cutting to allow the water level to be lowered further.

James Tiver JP celebrated his 77th birthday last week. He has lived in Burra for 51 years. Mr Tiver with Mr Thomas Burgoyne placed the first bridge over the Redruth Creek, [the Burra Creek at Redruth] built the first Wallaroo Smelters in conjunction with Messrs Pulsford and the late David Bower, the first public house in Kadina, the first woolshed at Gum Creek, the first house for Alex McCulloch at Gottlieb’s Well [South of Terowie: Parnggi Well since 1918.] and had many large contracts in the northeast. He has had the Aberdeen store for over 30 years. He has five sons and five daughters – all married. He and his wife are still hale and hearty and he is a typical Welshman standing something like 6ft and his sons and daughters are also tall.

The Phosphate Mines. Lily Dora Mine has been shut down because the payable phosphate rock has been exhausted. Mr H. Hassell took over the claim along with other claims some time ago and about 250 tons of selected rock have been despatched, but cartage costs means only high percentage rock is economic.

Martindale Sluicing Co. It is expected that matters will have progressed to the stage where the prospectus can be issued in a few days.

Mary Heinrich of the Burra Hotel writes to complain of the ineptitude and/or laziness of M-C Clarke following on from the recent case involving the stolen boots. Some larrikin locked some of Heinrich’s fowls and a duck in one of the hotel’s bedrooms and all M-C Clarke did was to suggest they see a solicitor. He was also asked to compel a dismissed ‘boots’ to return the hotel’s keys to the gas-house, cellar and stable, but refused to take any action.

[The editor comments that the constable’s actions call for a reprimand and that there is no place in the town for ‘a man of Clarke’s calibre’.]

Football. Wednesday: Ramblers 4.11 (35) defeated Kooringa 4.8 (32).

Burra Town Council

An Electrical Storm this week was quite severe and also dropped 1.39” of rain.

A Bolt. On Saturday afternoon Billy Barkley’s horse bolted just as Joe Woollacott was about to get into the cart and drive off. Joe stuck to the runaway from the shop until it was perilously close to the pump where he had to let go. The vehicle caught the guard enclosing the pump and turned over, taking the horse with it. No great damage was done to either.

Dance. The first hop for the season for the Burra Cinderellas was held at the Institute on Monday night when about 30 couples danced from 8 to midnight on a very stormy evening. W.J.C. Ewins was M-C. Their next dance is on 10 July.

The Corricks Co. played to a good house on Tuesday and a better on Wednesday last. They intend to return about September. [The performance is not described, but it must have been a vaudeville type variety program since reference is made to marvellous singing, a wonderful comic, Mr Chris Young, and to beautiful pictures thrown on a screen.]

Obituary. Porter Elliott of Terowie was run over by a train shunting at Terowie.

[John Elliott died 27 June 1906 at Terowie aged 48.]

He had written to his daughter who was attending school in Burra, saying that she could stay in Burra much longer than originally intended. Within an hour of receiving his letter a telegram arrived calling her to Terowie because her father had been killed.

W. Correll has taken over management of the Farrell’s Flat Hotel.

Henry Pinch. There are few residents better able to tell tales of the past as far as Burra is concerned than Mr Henry Pinch. He has been a resident for a very long time, and was among the first, if not actually the first, buyer of allotments in Aberdeen in the early days. [The reference should here be to Redruth.] He is now 78 years of age, while his better half is his senior by about ten years, and of the two Mr Pinch enjoys the best of health. Mrs Pinch has been ill for some time, and a father time does his work her condition is getting more serious, and she cannot be left alone. ‘Harry’ as he is familiarly called, served his time as a blacksmith in the old country, but when he came to SA he failed to get employment at the trade and so put in 20 years as a miner at the Burra Mine. He has lived a retired life for some time.

Mrs C. Pressick has started business in the store previously occupied by Mr w. Barkley and known as Dobbie’s. She will sell groceries and haberdashery. Mr Pressick lost his sight some time ago and then canvassed the town selling from a handcart, but he is now too weak to continue. Five small girls depend on Mrs Pressick.

Burra Music and Dramatic Club concert was poorly attended. Mr E.A. Shakespeare, who was specially engaged gave dramatic recitals which were the best heard here. The musical selections were very well done.

Father Redden is expected to be absent on sick leave for about twelve months. Since coming here he has been active in many aspects of town life and took a special interest in the young and in football. He is an everyday gentleman who has endeared himself not only to his own congregation, but to those of other denominations.

Burra Mine: Burra Burra Copper Co.

There have been no further developments regarding a possible sale. It is amazing that with copper prices so high nothing is being done with the property. Modern treatment processes have costs that are half those of the old mine. In the last couple of years the opportunity to ascertain the potential wealth of the mine has been wasted. At present little or no development is being done and that in hand is not remunerative. Some men have been put on to treat material that was handled in the past. Why some men doing this are on day work and others on tribute to treat precisely the same dump seems strange. The pump is still working periodically. Its potential is not realised as the pumps are not deep enough and the inrush of water is not strong enough to keep it going all the time.

Eastern Mining & Prospecting Syndicate failed to get its money in its call of £1 per share recently. The board have called a meeting for 21 July when a balance sheet and list of assets will be produced. The claim is about 30 miles east of Burra and some good examples of gold were won.

The Burra Record. This issue saw a change in the size and organisation of the paper. It increased in size to become seven instead of five columns wide. It changed from eight pages to four and many items were printed using an annoyingly smaller typeface. The reason given was that with an increased circulation they needed to print the paper more quickly and the new format cut the number of times the paper had to run through the printing machine.

A Bolt. A horse in a trap driven by Mrs H. Roach was frightened by Dr Sangster’s car at Henderson’s corner on Thursday afternoon and bolted up Thames St. No damage was done to the vehicle or occupants, but the horse has been suffering from palpitations ever since.

Mr Mozart who is installing gas at the Institute has placed a street lamp at Henderson’s corner for a month’s trial. It was lit for the first time on Saturday evening and gave a steady light, but the old ‘best’ light [kerosene] illuminated the area better, having been placed much higher. There is the need for one or two more lamps in town whether they are to be acetylene or other.

District Councils have been told they cannot pay a bounty for fox scalps taken from private land, only for those taken on Crown Land.

‘Broadminded’ writes questioning whether Christians and specifically church-goers are more likely to lead purer and better lives. ‘Is it not true that other factors play a more important part in forming character than mere belief – such as heredity, pre-natal influence, environment etc.?

Report of the Motor Trip to Morgan. [Details in 11⁄3 columns.]

[Some of the report is in a whimsical style with references to the adventures of individual participants without using their names. They were doubtless identifiable to many of the readers by the references to their vehicles or other hints.]

On 14 July nine motorcycles and three motor cars set out from Jack Richardson’s Garage in Commercial Street. The cars headed for Koomooloo while the motorcycles went to ‘The Gums’ which they reached in about 11⁄2 hours. Here they had a sumptuous tea. From there it was a 40 minute ride into Morgan, arriving at 5.30 p.m. They were met by Captain Oliver and shown over the P.S. Gem. In the evening they attended a dance.

On Saturday morning they inspected the river etc. while waiting for the cars that were due that morning from Koomooloo. These duly arrived about 11.30. Late in the afternoon the cars returned to Koomooloo via Florieton, which was a better road than the route they had used in the morning. The cycles reached ‘The Gums’ about 5 p.m. where they had tea and enjoyed a good night, though the elements outside were rough.

On Monday morning they set out for Burra. Harold Pearce went along to show them a better route to follow via the stock road, but they had not gone far when a severe dust storm struck reducing visibility virtually to zero. They could not even hear the noise of the bikes. Riders had to dismount and push their vehicles, which was a very hard task in the wind. They managed to reach a fence and follow it to a gate to get their bearings again. Mr Pearse, who had come as a guide, was lost soon after leaving the homestead and never seen again, though the telegraph confirmed that he eventually found his way home. One rider managed to get to Burra about 12 o’clock. Torr from Mintaro got a hole in his petrol tank that had to be plugged with a mud-pie. He then did all right until striking a heavy hail storm at Ford’s slaughterhouse. He then abandoned the machine and walked into Burra Station and caught a train home.

[The adventures of the others become hard to unravel, but the following at least gives a feel of their troubles.]

The remaining riders struggled on contending now with wind, rain and hail. One made a dash for the light of a farm and ended up with a generous handful of German sausages. A group of riders made it to the ruins of Midwinter’s old hotel [near where the road leads off to Robertstown] and for a time they sought the shelter of its crumbling walls. One was missing, but they found him at a fire where he was enjoying some roley pole* that he had extracted from the tucker box of a passing teamster. Somewhere along the way they acquired a horse and cart to transport a damaged machine. They finally struggled on to Ford’s slaughterhouse where they were met by the ambulance and eventually got back to Burra. The cars are reported upon more sketchily, but one of them had difficulties getting to Koomooloo on day one, but finally managed it. Another gave trouble between Koomooloo and Morgan. Their adventures in returning in the storm are not recounted, but presumably they made it home eventually. Everyone is said to have enjoyed themselves despite mechanical difficulties, an overdose of German sausage and the weather. [* Roly-poly: a strip of suet-crust pastry spread with jam or fruit or sometimes a savoury mixture and rolled up, wrapped in grease-proof paper and steamed or boiled as a pudding.]

‘They say’ that “Barty” is now adjudged an expert of German sausages.

Burra Railway Station. The railway platform has been enclosed with a picket fence and entry to it to meet a friend or to say goodbye will be charged 3d.

‘[For] many years past numbers of young men and women have paraded the platform out of mere curiosity - it is said - to the detriment of those who wished to have egress and ingress to the carriages, a change was at last necessary.’

Now it will be necessary to make more room for cabs, as they will now stand in the main entrance, unless regulated. More room for them and other vehicles need be made by cutting away the bank in front of the station. Another needed change is for the stop here to be ten rather than five minutes - actually only four when the bell is rung. The refreshment rooms are second to none, but the public are always complaining of the altogether too short stay.

‘The urinals are only open now during the arrival of passenger trains, and closed, like a prison gate, immediately on departure.’ On Saturday the Manoora footballers were provided with a carriage, but no other convenience was made and the result in the immediate neighbourhood of the closed urinals was a scene of the filthiest description.

[John McGilchrist was born 9 July 1877 at Naracoorte and died 12 August 1906 at Naracoorte, residence Bordertown. It seems strange not to have mentioned the J. McGilchrist who only in the last issue was said to be coming to Kooringa from Naracoorte to open a shop. The latter would seem to be the deceased’s father James, because James McGilchrist dies in Kooringa 3 October 1909 aged 73.]

Redruth Court, Friday

Three young men were charged on information of R.H. Finch with having entered his dwelling at ‘Tarkee’ near Burra and stealing two suits of clothes and other articles. They were John Nash, Thomas Heffernan and George Bryant.

Mr R.H. Finch gave evidence of leaving the stolen items at the locked house and of returning to find the building had been broken into and the items stolen. He identified the men as having been in the neighbourhood and identified the items produced.

Henry Finch gave evidence of a similar nature and valued the goods at £6.

Other evidence was given by John Thomas Neate, manager of Springbank Station, John O’Leary railway packer, who was missing an oilskin coat that had been seen with the accused and Murray Phelan clerk of Redruth.

M-C Phelan recalled the reporting of the offence and recounted the enquiries concerning the three men, the discovery of the missing items and the subsequent arrest at Hallett in the bedroom of a hotel.

M-C Clark gave evidence corroborating the above. The accused were committed for trial.

Burra Show. ‘A Rare Exhibit’: A vixen and six young were exhibited at the Burra Show last Wednesday and attracted much attention from the many who had never seen a fox before.

The show just escaped the heavy rain of Thursday, which brought the creek down higher than for some time.

The floodwaters on Thursday threatened the small footbridge in front of the Post Office, (comprising simply three boards without side rail) when it rose to within two inches of the boards and over them in places. Some children diverted to the Burra Hotel crossing which also need attention.

While the creek was running strongly in the morning Howard West, son of William West Sen. amused himself by running back and forth over the footbridge opposite the Post Office until he became giddy and fell in. His screams and those of his brother were attracted Mr Vardey, who plunged in fully clothed and caught the drowning boy with some difficulty. He was taken to the home of John McLaren where he was bathed and comforted before going home in a trap sent for him.

The Corricks attracted a great deal of excitement with people assembling on the steps before 7 p.m. by which time at least 200 people were present. Sales of 1/- tickets were suspended at 7.20 and 2/- ones at 7.40 when there was no more seating available. Forms were set in the aisle and right up to the stage. People crammed like sardines onto the wings of the stage and many were turned away. The program was intensely funny and particularly refined. Monday saw another bumper audience. Mr Chris Young convulsed the audience both nights.

The Burra Show was a great success at Victoria Park on Wednesday with c. £70 taken at the gates.

The weather was threatening with wind and dust until 9 a.m., but then a change brought good conditions.

Agricultural products could have been much better represented, but those on show were of the first quality.

G. Bailey scored the prize for wheat and Thomas Reynolds of Booborowie that for chaffed hay.

In Dairy produce the best collection and display was by E.N. Finch.

Draught stock was only a small section, but the quality was very good and much the same applied to blood stock. Roadster stock was of good quality and a popular section. Horses in action were as popular as ever.

Cattle numbers were up and better than formerly.

Dogs were good this year and though some years have seen more greyhounds there have not been better.

Pigs were not numerous and Hon. J.J. Duncan was the most successful exhibitor.

Agricultural implements could have been more numerous, as they attract great interest.

The exhibits of local coach-builder Mr S. Burns attracted interest: express buggy for C. Parks, masher cart for T. Pearse of ‘The Gums’, a hooded buckboard for J. Reed, a jump-seat sulky for Mr Neate and a masher cart for T. Turner.

The wood-chopping contest caused much excitement and the crowds left other attractions when it was announced. Four contestants put in an appearance and the winner was E. Cahill from WA, ahead of local Sam Finch.

Sheep entries were better and larger than previously and additional pens had to be erected. T. Sandland won Champion Merino Ram as well as Special. He also won the pen of 5 rams.

Poultry entries were a record. Messrs Flamank & Dennison were the most successful, having sent along between 60 & 70 entries.

Flowers were hardly up to earlier years’ standards and entries were well down.

Cookery entries were up.

The small display in the School Class section is disappointing and will have to be worked up. Needlework was the one area of first-class work.

In fruit and vegetables Ah Chin practically scooped the pool with exhibits far superior to any hitherto seen at a local show. His collection was a credit to any gardener.

The Terowie Brass Band played throughout the day.

A committee of ladies ran the refreshment booth better than ever.

E.J. Harris displayed an impressive pyramid of dairy produce of a great variety of product and great quality.

F. Harris showed a fine collection of dried fruit from Renmark.

He was charged with unlawful possession and given seven days, rather than with larceny which carries a heavier sentence.

Albert March, aged 11, had a lucky escape from death when a length of railway line suspended from the rafters in their horse shed, fell at one end and pinned him to the ground by the head. He suffered a broken nose and was at times delirious. Had the other end of the rail fallen he would have been crushed to a pulp.

The Record challenges W.H. Hardy, witness in the recent libel case, to prove or produce the slightest tinge of evidence that Mrs A. Willmott had a perambulator in Market Square or any other street of the town on 7 September 1906 - £5 will be handed over on production of the same.

VX, 744, 17 Oct. 1906, page 2-3

The Record libel case.

This is reported in great detail.

On 12 September the paper ran an advertisement in which it was suggested that Joseph Cartwright had visited the house of Mrs Alfred Willmott and made improper proposals to her. Cartwright then sued the Record and Alfred Willmott as defendants in a libel case. On Monday 8 October the case ran from 11 a.m. to 10.30 p.m. and the court was filled in the day and crammed at night. The defence of The Record contended that the paper’s apology in the next issue was ample for anyone, but ‘a money grabber of the worst kind’.

Louisa Jane Willmott, wife of Alfred Willmott gave evidence that Joseph Cartwright had called several times at her home while her husband was away. Cartwright’s wife was a cousin to Alfred Willmott. The vital day was 7 September when she said he called before she was up and dressed, because she was not feeling very well. He went away, but later returned when she was dressed and after some conversation had suggested they go into her bedroom and he had placed his hand under her clothes. She had told him she would not and was not such a d______ fool. She said she would be telling his wife and had also complained of his behaviour to her sister and mother. Her children Frank (9) and Mary (7) were present throughout.

The counsel for the plaintiff tried to show her as promiscuous and a habitual liar.

She admitted the marriage had been in difficulties, but said she and her husband were now getting on fairly well. However, she could not say ‘I have been faithful to my husband altogether.’

Her version of events was supported by the two children and Alice Moore (her sister) and her mother Mrs Lines.

Mr R.G. Nesbit for Mr Davey of the Burra Record gave a long address contending that the apology published and a letter sent to the plaintiff were adequate in the circumstances.

The evidence tendered on behalf of the plaintiff was an absolute denial that the whole event took place and a denial of ever being to the house. [Cartwright would scarcely admit knowing which house they lived in, though they had previously been neighbours in East St.] Much of the evidence sought to show Cartwright’s whereabouts on the day in question to account for his movements and to show he could not have been at Mrs Willmott’s house. His reasons for going to the saleyards near the Burra Hotel seemed a bit thin, but a number of respectable witnesses saw him there and/or spoke to him.

After the evidence was presented there were long addresses by both Counsels and the bench adjourned. When the court reassembled the SM reviewed the evidence and said the court was unanimous in fixing damages at £50 against Willmott and the Record.

A Bolt. T.P. Halls and two friends were thrown from a sulky at Mitchell Flat on Sunday. When a reluctant horse was given ‘a moderate supply of long oats’ it leaped forth snapping the traces and dashed off, pulling Halls over the rein guard and shooting his companions from the vehicle. Fortunately a shaking was the only consequence. The horse got to Baldina Creek before being recaptured.

Trip to Booborowie by ‘Mick & Royal’

The writers say they got a ride to Booborowie Station with some shearers in a cart.

They went around Shafton where they got great views of magnificent crops. They passed the home of Mr Stockman – the former home of the late Mr Cockrum. The plains gave a tremendous yield of hay or wheat. To the right lay Mr Chapman’s and towards Braefoot Mr Forrest’s and then Mr Webster’s. These were three new houses and out houses. As they passed Gum Creek there was land under lucerne and the wheat crops were in places as high as the fences. The most notable farm in this area belonged to the Bailey Bros. and was a model from an agricultural point of view. At Braefoot the feed was extremely short and the land seemed to have been overstocked generally. There was more feed around the homestead, but by the end of shearing this would have gone. There were some fine crops towards Booborowie; often higher than the fence and a number of neatly kept farm houses were passed. They arrived at Booborowie Station in time for afternoon tea. This substantial meal was served on spotless tinware and ended with ‘brownie’ – a novelty for them. It was an agreeable surprise being a very nice cake, although they were told it comprised only fat, currants and flour. They inspected the shearing shed of 20 machines, 10 on each side. It is one of the largest and loftiest in SA and was all in keeping with the cleanliness of the dining room. The night accommodation for the shearers was satisfactory. The shearers they found to be well mannered, courteous and of refined language. They returned by the main road past Ayers Forest which looked like natural growth. The trees were doing well and they felt sure that very few people in the town were aware that they had such a magnificent forest within a few miles of their doors.

In several places in the report large quantities of milling ore are reported as being found, but there is no mention of extracting it or any estimate of its earning potential. There is no available machinery at the mine to treat milling ore, so what is the point of going after it? The sale of ore was within £6 of the tributers’ contribution. In effect it was costing 60/- to get 20/- worth of ore.

Capitalists are said to be negotiating to buy the mine.

Aberdeen Football Club celebrated winning the premiership with an annual social at the Royal Exchange Hotel on Thursday evening. Attendance was disappointingly low. W.J. Richards took the chair. There was the usual series of toasts for which the speakers were: W.J. Davey, C. Tiver, W. Neville, Mr Chapman, T. Harris, James Richards, R. Neville, Thomas Tiver, W.H. Hardy, A.G. Shortridge & W. Barkley.

R. Neville got the award for all-round best player. The most effective service medal went to J.D. Kelly and P. Casey was the most gentlemanly player. W. Neville Jnr gave the club report [which oddly enough revealed there were fewer financial members than there were players in the team.]

Kooringa Club was not represented and only a couple of men represented the Rambler Club. For them Mr Hardy said ‘he had watched most games for the season, and considered football was the only game worth going very far to see. He congratulated Aberdeen on appropriating the Premiership. The Ramblers were not hardly strong enough, but they might come along next year. As soon as the season was over Ramblers and Kooringas dropped all interest in it like a hot spud, they were going to hold a picnic directly to celebrate the success they had made during the season.

IOR District Officers visited on Tuesday to examine the workings of the order and were entertained in the evening at a social. Secretary C.J. Pearce was congratulated on his work. 70-80 members from the three branches attended.

World’s End School held its annual picnic on Wednesday in fine weather.

Obituary. The Monkey Jack Wall died last week at Booborowie. [Presumably this animal was well known in the district as no information leading up to his death is given. It would seem reasonable to assume he was owned by a human Jack or John Wall.] Apparently he escaped from his cage and created all sorts of trouble including taking the top of his Captain’s little finger nearly off. It was decided he had to die and having been hunted into a toilet and ending up down the hole was left there to die. The next morning he emerged in a filthy state and was finally killed.

Weather & the Season. The hot weather has much reduced the anticipated yield of wheat in the east. Haymaking has commenced much earlier than expected, but the quality will be lower than expected. To the west the crops are better and were much less damaged by the heat, though here too the yield was reduced. Rain fell yesterday when 114 points were recorded. The creek rose and Market Square was flooded due to blockages in drainage.

It makes him think something is wrong.

Weather: Saturday Storm

Last Saturday was very windy and dusty. To the east it was very bad with one report describing a great rising spiral of dust that was brown lower down and changing to red and then spreading out over the horizon to hang like the aurora borealis. Heavy clouds then gathered and some light rain fell, but not enough to settle the dust.

In the town the wind rose further towards evening and from 11 p.m. to midnight blew like a cyclone. Trees, fences and roofs of both dwellings and outbuildings were removed by its force. The accompanying rain was light but steady and caused the creek to begin to flow. Buildings shook as in an earthquake.

In Kooringa George Herbert had the verandah ripped from the house and the picket fence was flattened. The roof of the old Primitive Methodist Schoolroom was badly damaged. The wind from the northeast caught the iron and ripped it from its beams depositing it on the other side of the building. What was not carried away either fell in or was twisted into many shapes.

A large tree fell across the tennis court fence.

A large piece of ridge-capping was ripped from the old Bible Christian Church and carried across the creek and another two lengths travelled over a quarter of a mile to land in Thames St. A house in Stock St lost its roof and a number of places lost windows; either from the force of the wind or from flying debris. Many roofs had guttering torn from them. Tons of fruit has been stripped from trees and flower gardens have been cut down as with a mower.

On farms wheat crops were laid flat and not bent over, but broken off. Farmers are trying to collect it for hay, but are having trouble getting it off the fields. Cocked hay was blown completely away and one farmer lost about four tons.

In Redruth George Bartholomaeus lost the roofs from his outhouses and the iron fowl house was uplifter and rolled along the road. Several roofs there were lifted and will need repair. One resident saw his roof lift as much as two feet, but with his weight and that of a couple of buggy wheels he managed to stop it leaving altogether.

A Concert at St Mary’s Hall in the Pipe Organ Fund series is reported.

Cricket. At Farrell’s Flat on Saturday Burra 89 defeated Farrell’s Flat 58.

Mr & Mrs & Miss Martin were given a farewell at St Mary’s Schoolroom on Monday afternoon. Mr Martin had occupied several important church positions.

At the railway station on Saturday he received a nice smoking outfit from the employees there and on Saturday afternoon Mr Bowman gave an ‘At Home’ to Mr & Mrs Martin at Wandillah.

Weather. The storm at Hanson was similar to at Burra. Outbuildings suffered in particular and one fowl house was found floating on a dam the next morning. In areas where the crops were not flattened they have benefited from the rain.

The East Ward election will be held on 1 December 1906.

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co.

An Adelaide gentleman is reported to have paid £250 deposit and so considerable changes are expected in the near future.

The Storm that passed through recently has given carpenters considerable work. In one place the wind, being unable to lift the roof forced the ceiling in the front room to fall down, doing much damage to the furniture and destroying a large overmantel. A house on Cemetery Flat, vacated only the day before, was unroofed and the covering carried a couple of hundred yards and placed against Mr Thomas Broad’s residence.

Miss Kiekebusche is getting along well after her recent serious operation in the Burra Hospital.

W. Kellaway writes concerning the report of a loss of £893-19-2 for the Burra Mine recently. He says the company had no need to look for milling ore. They just needed two or three jigs to treat the hundreds of thousands of tons that have been staring them in the face for years. Pump the water out and spend the money searching virgin ground. The mine ought to be employing a thousand men, but there seems to be no go in either the directors or the management.

The Canowie Estate proprietors have bought a stud Merino ram Donald Dinnie reportedly for 1,200 guineas.

The United Labor Party held a large meeting on Saturday night at the residence of Mr T.A. Gregg at the old Smelts. The branch was formed on 6 October 1906 and has since got some 80 new members. Offices were declared vacant to allow new members representation and Elected were President, T. Davis; Vice President, E.C. Sedgman; Treasurer, T.A. Gregg (re-elected); Secretary, F. Carless (re-elected); Assistant Secretary, J. Lepley.

W.H. Hardy seems to have had a hard time running from ward to ward to get a couple of people to nominate him. He complained that Cr Snell was giving him a hard time by not saying whether he would stand again. Mr Hardy says many persons have asked him to come out for different wards, but on the face of it he is compelled to waltz around town with his nomination forms practically begging someone to place their monogram on the paper. He went first to North Ward, but no one was taking the bait and eventually when [J. Walker] came out for that ward he decided not to oppose him. When he heard Mr Ockenden was coming out for East Ward he said he didn’t care if 500 Ockendens came out. Then he was told that john Wise was running in West Ward and Hardy then fell back on East Ward. He spoke [at the Ratepayers’ Meeting] in a most disjointed fashion about the rubbish depot and said microbes were blowing all over the town from it. He accused the Council of being stagnant. He also said ‘When I was in Council there were many shady things done.’ This calls for some explanation. He did not tell ratepayers who was responsible for those things, but it is a strange thing that since he has been out of Council there have been no ‘rumpuses’. In his time it was certainly a pantomime and a bear garden and the dignity of Council was buried deep and beyond all rhyme and reason as well as sensibility. What he said ‘savoured very much of inconsistency, indiscreetness and ignorance.’

VX, 749, 28 Nov. 1906, page 3

Ratepayers’ Meeting at the Institute last Wednesday. Attendance was small with about 20 at the start and a few more as time went by. Mr Crewes took the chair.

The Mayor’s Report for 1906

The Council did good work with the funds available. During the year it adopted model by-laws prepared by the Municipal Association.

One Councillor Mr Launder died during the year. He served a little over two years as Councillor for East Ward and his loss was greatly regretted. He was replaced by Cr Bennetts.

At this time last year the general account was in credit £47-19-2 and tonight it is in credit £42-18-8, but this will largely be gone after the next pay sheet.

North Ward is in credit £3-0-4, East Ward is in debit £5-12-1 and West Ward is in debit £3-17-7.

This year we have paid £31-10-0 for anew assessment and as a result there is a reduction in the aggregate of c. £594, which will on the present rate mean less income in 1907.

Lighting cost £44-15-10. We purchased two acetylene gas lamps for £12 leaving £32-15-0 for running costs. The new lamps have been economic and give a good light. Lack of funds prevents the extension of gas lighting for the time being.

Park Lands. Regrettably vandalism to young trees continues. The account is in credit £7-11-0.

The main road grant was £273 and this has been expended.

The Cemetery has received much attention and has been improved. The account is in credit £57-5-8.

The Local Board of Health has had no significant outbreaks of infectious disease to deal with this year with only a few cases of scarlatina reported. The sanitary condition of the town has been maintained. The account is in credit £79-0-8.

The Council has worked very harmoniously this year and thanks are extended to Councillors, the Town Clerk and other Council workers.

C.A. Fuss moved the adoption of the report.

Cr W.C.L. West said he had decided to retire as a Councillor after 14 years on the Corporation.

The retiring Mayor Mr J. Drew said the town could do with 10 or 12 more acetylene lamps. He was disappointed with the destruction of young trees by lads. Tar paving of paths was cheaper than gravelling and almost as good as asphalt. He could not see his way clear to nominating for Mayor again.

Mr Davis tried to move a vote of thanks to Cr Roach, but when he turned it into an attack on Council for black-balling him over the scavenging tender he was ruled out of order.

R. Ockenden then moved a vote of thanks to the retiring Mayor and Councillors and was seconded by C.A. Fuss.

Mr Davis then got in his complaint about not getting the scavenging contract when it was awarded to the highest tender. He thanked Cr Roach for trying to be fair, even though he was overruled.

Cr Roach said he didn’t appreciate Mr Davis’s remarks at all and in retrospect thought he deserved censure for revealing what had gone on in the Council Chamber and now endorsed the actions of his colleagues who had done the proper thing in accepting the highest tender.

Candidates were then invited to speak.

Cr West said his experience in Council over 14 years made him well qualified to become Mayor. He favoured the planting of trees and tar dressing and was against any increase in rates.

J. Walker thought he was well known and if elected would do his best for town and ward.

R. Ockenden said it was only that day that he had decided to stand, but he would strive to do justice to all and side with no party.

Mr Hardy said he was in a bit of a fix. He had asked Cr Snell if he was going to stand in East Ward, but he had said he didn’t know. This left him [Mr Hardy] in a hole, as he didn’t want to ‘run amuck of the present councillor’. He had promised North Ward ratepayers he would represent them, but now they had a candidate from their own ward and he would not oppose him. He had been to Mr Wise and that gentleman had signed a nomination paper for West Ward, so he was now going for East Ward. He heard Mr Ockenden was coming out for East Ward, but in reply had said ‘I don’t care if 500 Ockendens are coming out I am too.’

The Mayor and Councillors had worked well together. There could be too much stagnation in Council. ‘There were many shady things done while I was in Council.’

The rubbish depot was in the wrong place and it was common to see papers of all sorts blowing down the main street from the depot.

The Mayor said a man goes every day and burns the rubbish and if Mr Hardy were to go up there now he would not get enough paper to fill his hat.

The speaker then said he didn’t know what the depot was like lately, but it used to be bad. (laughter)

Even if paper was not blown out of it microbes were blown all over the town from it.

World’s End. The recent storm on the 17th brought with it over 170 points of rain and considerable crop damage. Wheat yet green will recover, but early varieties were too far advanced to come back. Many houses and outbuildings suffered damage. F. Duldig’s horse stable lost about 70ft of its 100ft roof, but the iron essentially slid down the wall and was little damaged. It was soon replaced.

Wandillah and Cartapo Blocks bought by the Government for closer settlement are in the hands of the surveyor.

The Old Smelts. Not long ago Messrs Martin & Co. of Gawler successfully extracted copper by treating the old slag heap. Now a gentleman proposes to treat the fine stuff and on paper it appears all right. Samples have been sent away for assay and it is believed it is the intention to float a company.

The Ramblers will have a moonlight ramble on the occasion of their annual picnic tonight at the Princess Royal. Drags will leave Market Square at 1.30 p.m.

Mr Hardy’s candidature for East Ward will cost the Council about £4 that could well have been saved, but ‘Mr Hardy was determined to blow off in one of the three wards at all hazards and he is now blown out.’

The New Council has one blacksmith, one storekeeper, two graziers, one labourer, one manager, and one carpenter. Five are Methodists and two Church of England. Two are Foresters, two are Rechabites, three are Oddfellows and there are two local preachers.

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. The new company which anticipates taking over the Burra Mine is making arrangements to commence operations after Christmas. Men at present there will work up to Christmas, after which the mode of procedure is unknown.

Mr ‘Watty’ Truscott has fitted a cool storage room to keep beef, mutton, lamb, pork, sausages etc. for a month if necessary. We inspected it recently and were glad to get into the warm weather again. Little meat will now be kept in the shop window or even in the shop. Customers will be served direct from the cool chamber.

A Concert at Hanson on Wednesday evening in aid of the local school was popular, with every seat taken and some looking through the windows despite the unpleasant and stormy weather. [Details in 1⁄2 column.]

Obituary. John Carey of Thames St died at the age of 87. He was born at North Molton in Devon and came to Australia in 1853. After working briefly in Adelaide he came to Burra, but then went on to Booborowie where he worked as a carpenter for about 20 years. He then returned to Burra and started a chaff-cutting business. Aged eventually caused him to stop work, but he was never laid up with a serious illness. About three years ago he fractured his leg and although with care he recovered, he had since had to use a crutch and stick to get around. He used to wear glasses, but late in life lost them and found he could read without. He leaves a son Frederick with whom he had lived for the last 18 years and two daughters: Mrs A.G. Muller (Broken Hill) and Mrs R. Webber (Mt Bryan East). There are 22 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren. Mr Carey’s wife died about 20 years ago.

[John Carey born 10 Feb 1820 and died 27 November 1906 aged 86. His wife died 20 March 1878 aged 51.]

Weather. A heatwave set in last week. On Friday, Saturday & Sunday the temperature reached 94°F before 10 a.m. Flower gardens were destroyed and birds sought refuge in houses. Others fell dead from trees. A number of valuable fowls also succumbed. Monday was cloudy and somewhat cooler, but very sultry with a cool change in the evening and a few points of rain.

Frank Alfred Willmott (10) was charged on information of his mother with being an uncontrolled child. He was called before the court at 2 p.m. on Monday, but went rabbiting and had to be captured by the police. He was sent to Edwardstown Reformatory till the age of 18.

Ulooloo goldfield is still being worked by a few prospectors.

Burra School. Mr Scott’s report on Visiting Day said there were 308 on the roll and 267 had been examined. 14 Compulsory and 10 Honours Certificates were obtained and 5 students under 12 had gained the necessary marks for a Compulsory Certificate. He said unfortunately not enough lads had enrolled to form a cadet corps.

Burra Teachers’ Association met on Saturday morning. Speakers were Inspectors Burgan and McBride and the Vice-President of the SA Teachers’ Union, W.H. Cherry.

James Tiver was presented with a framed address in recognition of past services at Redruth Methodist Sunday School last Sunday afternoon. Age has caused him to retire as superintendent, a position he has filled from time to time over the last 40 years. [He was 77.] H. Preece takes over that role.

Mr W.C. Neville is about to move to Bute and was given a farewell at the same time. He was a past scholar and later the Sunday school librarian.

Weather. Rain averaging about half an inch fell fairly widely in the east on Monday following temperatures of the previous few days that had been between 108°F and 120°F.

St Mary’s Strawberry Fete was held at the Burra Institute last Friday and was very successful. Mr W.G. Hawkes opened the proceedings. A little over £140 was raised. Stallholders are listed.

[Personal interest: Mrs C. Fuss was on the strawberry stall.]

‘A working Man’ writes on early closing. For several years storekeepers have been closing at 6 p.m. on week days and 9 p.m. on Saturday and have given their assistants a half-holiday on Wednesday. As a working man I feel that 8 hours a day is quite long enough to work. We can all help by refusing to patronise storekeepers who persist in opening till 10 or 10.30 on Saturday. If business demanded such an extension it would be different, but several storekeepers have told me that business after 6 p.m. on Saturday scarcely pays for the kerosene.

Alice Hiddle was successful in the Intermediate Division of Trinity College Examinations held at Clare on Wednesday 5 December 1906.

‘Short & Sharp’

Burra Mine shares are still going up. A local speculator bought 166 at 4/- and sold a few days later at 6/-.

Obituary. Mrs Trevilyan, late of Copperhouse, died at Adelaide last week and was buried here on Friday.

[Born Mary Thomas 2 May 1846 Cornwall? and died Mary Trevelyan at Kilkenny, residence Burra, 6 December 1906 aged 60.]

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. At last something has happened. A Melbourne-Adelaide syndicate has paid a small deposit on purchase of the mine and is said to be determined to set to work almost immediately to develop the mine in a proper manner. For pig-rooting the recent work has taken the cake. Long ere this the mine should have been dressing thousands of tons of ore and competing on world markets. The human machinery has been wrong and the financial part of the venture has gone backwards. The company sold a few tons of ore for the year at a good price, but it was a trifling amount. Even given the slipshod way things have been done we cannot understand why better progress has not been made. Twelve months ago the directors promised if a concentrating plant were not erected the mine would be pumped dry. The pump is an excellent machine, but not suitable for unwatering the mine to any great depth. Has any satisfactory work resulted? No. Unless radical changes are made by the new management they will meet with dire disappointment. That in bygone days much ore-bearing material was neglected can be seen when by proper treatment tributers in the past six months have made better wages than when the mine was in full swing and that from abandoned stuff. We have gone into this and have tested the output by the tributers and the returns received. This will surprise many and we can give the public something more astounding directly. We have not traversed the drives and shafts without taking notes for future reference. Things were so peculiar that we were convinced long ago that no headway would be made and we said so. In the face of past folly we welcome news of a revival in town and do not doubt that with efficient management and the old workings left alone and a greater depth exploited there will be a much better result. The concentrating work should be abandoned and a smelter erected. Then every particle of ore would be saved. Present inspections have led people to be at a loss to know how the mine could have been allowed to remain idle for so long, especially when the ore exposed is of such a character as to impress anyone of its importance. Now the prospect of the sale of the mine is a major topic of conversation. We can only hope for a return to prosperity to be the result.

On Monday a man and a boy were seen to go down Peacocks-Ayers Shaft [sic: Peacock’s Air Shaft?] with a pick and a pound of candles. Some time ago it appears the boy lost a number of candles near there and it is likely they were in pursuit of them.

There are now three shifts at Paxton’s Shaft where very fair ore is being won.

We said at the start of work at Allen’s Shaft that the wrong direction was being pursued to recover the grey ore lode and though some poor stuff has been found the lode has not been exposed. We recommended the starting of operations there, but under very different conditions to those which have been followed.

VX, 752, 19 Dec. 1906, page 2

Editorial on Christmas. After the usual comments on Christmas traditions, Father Christmas and the like, the writer says that commercially 1906 brought little change to Burra. The Mine is still doing nothing, though it now has better prospects than for some time. Farmers have had a hard time, but even so the yield will be better than that reaped three or four years ago. Except for the wool industry Burra has nothing to commend itself at present and it is surprising that it has kept up so well.

The Corricks visited Burra for the third time on Saturday to an excellent reception. The various items on the program were all well carried out.

W. Salter of Farrell’s Flat has erected a nice large roomy place to answer the needs of dancing and holding a concert. It has a good smooth springy floor.

Harvesting is revealing further problems caused by the recent storm. G. Bailey of Gum Creek reports plants are very tangled and much grain is therefore being lost. Other farmers are also complaining of harvesting difficulties, but the quality of the grain is good.

Cyclists are warned that a new by-law makes it an offence to ride on footpaths.

St Joseph’s School. The annual examination of pupils took place last week and prizes were distributed on Tuesday. Dux of the school was Nora Melligan [sic: Milligan?]

A laden Christmas tree gave much pleasure to the little ones.

Miss Kiekebusche came though her second operation successfully and is doing well.

H.H. George the new stationmaster has settled in to his job.

Obituary. Thomas Nicholls boarded a train at Yunta yesterday morning to go to Adelaide for the holidays. At a point about a mile and a half on the Broken Hill side of Ucolta he fell from the end platform of a carriage and was cut to pieces under the wheels. He was unmarried.

[Thomas Nicholl died 18 December 1906 near Petersburg, residence Lilydale Station. Aged 40.]

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. Men are clearing up for the holidays and preparing for the handover to the new company. It is believed this will occur at the start of January 1907. The tributers expect to send away the ore they have on hand and so draw down the curtain on one of the most curious attempts in the world to work and develop a mine.

‘They Say’

Poor old Charley Cucumber [Heinrich] is leaving Burra and good old ‘out-back’ will take control of the Burra Hotel directly.

Sir Frederick beat Mr Vaughan by 2 to 1 on Wednesday.

We are to have a Lord as Boniface of the Burra Hotel.

W. Barkley writes about early closing. He says it is incorrect to say that storekeepers have been in the habit of closing at 9 p.m. on Saturday. Only drapers have done so and their carts continue to run about delivering goods, which is just as bad. It is impossible for fruiterers to close promptly at 9 and is it fair to ask a man to close at 9 when 9-10 is his busiest time during the summer months? As for 8 hours, most chop assistants work a 91⁄2 hour day. I do not wish to take away privileges and always pay overtime. As for Saturday night not paying for the kerosene, he must have asked that question on a very cold, wet winter’s night. [Fruiterers probably got a late delivery by train on Saturdays.]

VX, 752, 19 Dec. 1906, page 3

Obituary. Mr James Wheller of Farrell’s Flat died after a long and painful illness. He was a friend to everybody and many a person has had much to thank him for. He was born at Watervale in 1849 and lived there with his parents for some time. He married his present wife in 1875 at Mintaro Church and then moved to Tarlee where he carried on business as a blacksmith for a number of years before moving to Farrell’s Flat where he has been a blacksmith and general dealer for 16 years. He took a great and active interest in town and district affairs and was an energetic Councillor for a number of years. He was a staunch Methodist and an enthusiastic worker for the Farrell’s Flat Methodist Church. That the church is comfortable, well maintained and free of debt owes much to the work and liberality of Mr Wheller and his family. A few months ago he contracted cancer and has been largely confined to his bed for some time. He died on Saturday evening 8 December and was buried in Mintaro Cemetery. He is survived by a widow, three sons and two daughters: E. Wheller (Farrell’s Flat), Rev. Harold Wheller (studying for the ministry in Brisbane), Norman Wheller (Farrell’s Flat), Mrs W.T. Venning (Adelaide) and Lily Wheller (Farrell’s Flat). There are several grandchildren. [James Emanuel Wheller died 8 December 1906. Registration records say he married Mary Jane Gullidge 15 September 1875 in a house at Mintaro.]

Characteristics of the 1906 paper.

Page 1

A useful business directory for the town.

Large advertisements that were a mixture of local and others.

Page 2

A town directory with information on Municipal Officers, Markets, the Institute, Banks, Postal Matters, the Court, Train Timetables, Lodges, Cabs, District Council and Churches.

Then large advertisements, mostly of local origin.

Page 3

Advertisements, some of which look deceptively like news items. Sometimes a news item, but rarely if ever local.

Page 4

Some smaller advertisements: sales and public notices. Local news dominates the page.

Page 5

Local news and reports from regions and Adelaide etc. Also padding in the form of humour and quirky items from around the world.

Page 6

Some advertisements that look like news, more ‘fillers’ some other advertisements and sometimes some reading matter. For most weeks from 24 January to 11 July there was an episode from Charles White’s Australian Bushranging.

Pages 7 & 8

Large advertisements.

VX, 734 (2), 18 July 1906, page 2

This issue saw a change in the size and organisation of the paper. It increased in size to become seven instead of five columns wide. It changed from eight pages to four and many items were printed using an annoyingly smaller typeface. The reason given was that with an increased circulation they needed to print the paper more quickly and the new format cut the number of times the paper had to run through the printing machine.

Page 1

Large advertisements some local and others not.

Page 2

A few smaller advertisements, sales and public notices, but not as many as in earlier years. News begins early on the page, but is heavily mixed with news-like advertisements for things like toilet soap, or haemorrhoid cream. A column by ‘Eyespy’ of passing events concentrated largely on events from beyond the local area.

Page 3

Similar to page 2 with very wordy advertisements for items like Dr Williams Pink Pills, Clements Tonic and Zam-buk Balm, which surely no one ever read!

In general the paper was of fairly poor quality. Events that were foreshadowed were not always subsequently reported. The Council received perfunctory treatment: perhaps because it went so smoothly. ‘They Say’ & ‘Short & Sharp’ columns contained references to matters that could have been developed and which locals probably knew about, but are now obscure. There are many items that are essentially fillers. The actual printing is also poor with many pages faint and hard to read and the type size is very small and must have been hard to read by the artificial lights in use at the time.

Wheat. The first wheat for the season arrived at Burra railway station last week.

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. The present operations are expected to close on 10 January when the pumping plant will cease. ‘In the closing scene of the last two years’ shoddy and pig rooting operations there is nothing from any point of view to commend itself.’

Burra Town Council has increased the rate from 9d to 10d to avoid a shortfall of £20-£30.

Burra United Friendly Societies’ Sports were held on Boxing Day at Victoria Park. The report occupies 12⁄3 columns. The events were a mixture of flat races, hurdles and bicycle races. There was a good concert in the evening at the Institute.

The Holidays. Good weather prevailed. Crowds were down somewhat due to the smaller population. Mr H.H. George, the stationmaster, allowed fruit arriving by the late train between 7 & 8 on Christmas Eve to be removed at once, so saving losses and catering better for the public. McGilchrist & Co. specialised in toys and the interior of the old auction mart was transformed. The town was remarkably free of drunks. In the absence of any band this year, the Salvation Army serenaded a number of residents with carols.

Christmas Day saw the usual services and a cricket match and a fair crowd at the Boxing Day Sports at Victoria Park.

Burra High School held its prize day on 20 December in St Mary’s Schoolroom. Vera Fuss was dux for 1906. She was also credited with not missing a day of school for three years. She won the Rector’s scripture prize, Mr Roach’s Arithmetic prize and one for drawing and mapping. Other excellent scholars for the year were Clara Bartholomaeus, Benta Williams and Rita Vivian. The report of the Principal, Miss Annie Millar, is printed and occupies almost 1 column.

Burra Primary School also ended the year with a concert on 20 December. Enrolment for the year was 367. £1-8-0 was raised at the concert for the Burra Hospital. Prizes were distributed by the Mayoress, Mrs W.C.L. West. [Personal interest: among others H. Fuss and M. Fuss did not miss a day for 1906. Without further checking the identities are not clear: possibilities are Hilary, Hasle & Morris. The latter two being sons of H.J.A. Fuss.]

Copperhouse School had a treat organized by the head teacher, Mr Galle, on 20 December when a concert at 11.30 was followed by refreshments and sports.

Cricket. On Christmas Day at Victoria Park: Robertstown 148 defeated Burra 146.

Hanson Methodist Church. The Christmas Day tea meeting drew 140 from Burra by train and others in buggies etc. Rev. Yeoman and Messrs Woollacott & Bray addressed the crowd and the choir rendered some splendid singing before supper was served. In total the anniversary functions raised £14-16-6 which was considered very satisfactory.

‘Working Man’ writes saying visitors to Burra have expressed amazement at stores keeping open till nearly midnight on Christmas Eve and others doing business on Christmas Day. The excuse that it was to save the spoilage of fruit would be more believable if only that were being sold. All stores should close at 9 p.m. or the Early Closing Act should be invoked.

‘Ratepayer’ writes that too many tree guards in the town are dilapidated. Cattle are destroying trees between St Mary’s and the Mine Bridge on the western side of the road. The cedar trees need the removal of sprouts growing from the trunk.

Marriage. Kooringa Methodist Church, 27 December.

Obituary. Daniel James O’Leary, eldest son of the late John & Margaret O’Leary, died 2 January at Kooringa, aged 62.

John Lord has taken over from Charley Heinrich at the Burra Hotel.

‘If Mr Lord is looking for something hard he will find it in restoring the lost trade of the Burra Hotel.’

Captain J.A. Watt DSO has been awarded the long-service medal. He moved to Quorn about 6 months ago. He joined the SA Infantry Volunteer Corps as a corporal in 1864, [Check date: this is clearly wrong and 1884 would be closer.] was promoted to colour-sergeant and was instrumental in forming the Burra Rifle Corps and the Wallaroo and Kadina Volunteer Force. The latter he commanded up to 1901 when he was appointed to command a squadron of the 5th SA Imperial Bushmen, and served in South Africa. Later he commanded the 5th & 6th contingent and was mentioned in dispatches by Lord Kitchener for bravery. On return to Adelaide he was presented with an illuminated address by his contingent.

‘Ratepayer’ writes objecting to the habit that shopkeepers have of leaving packing cases on footpaths and [advertising] boards as well. On windy days they lie about causing people to be diverted into the street and horses to shy.

Fire. A fire broke out in H. Collins & Sons paddock at Mt Bryan c. 1 mile north of the railway station soon after a train passed on Saturday about noon. It ran northerly and jumped a chain road to Josiah Thomas’s paddock. Thomas O’Connell narrowly escaped being caught while trying to save some sheep on John Harris’s property. The fire then entered Collins & Sons 2nd paddock, jumped a road and entered Mt Bryan Sheep Station. Reaching the main road by the church, it entered Richard Collins’s paddock and surrounded the residence. It threatened Pearce Bros wheat crop, but turned N-E towards their homestead, but was halted at the road near the house. The gusty wind then re-ignited it near the house and it again headed towards the wheat. This time it was extinguished just three chains from it. Richard Collins lost the most: principally grass and his garden. His sheds etc. were saved. H. Collins & Sons lost grass, but saved their stock and Messrs Thomas and Harris lost considerable grass. Mr Harris had some stock caught, but it is thought they will survive. It was over a mile wide and two miles long. A small portion of Wandillah estate was burnt.

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. The new company was expected to close the deal on Monday at 12 o’clock, but news later arrived that a gentleman representing a London company has made overtures to the new company, which set aside the first proposal for a day or two. News might be expected any day.

The prospects of something being done are looking up and a more systematic development of the property is hoped for. It was thought at first that the new company would keep the pumps going, but they will stop tomorrow. All but three of the tributers have knocked off. Had they been allowed to work systematically they would have returned some handsome profits, but they were limited to abandoned stuff. ‘We say without fear of contradiction that the Burra Burra Copper Company has lost a golden opportunity in not allowing the tributers to develop the mine, and thus prove it at no cost, but a profit to shareholders and the sooner a revolution takes place the better it will be for the town.’

It is probable Morphett’s Shaft will be repaired from top to bottom. The Burra Mine has been allowed to remain idle while smaller and less significant shows have been worked to advantage. To get a return a smelter is essential. There is every reason to believe 1907 will return prosperity to the town.

Obituary. D.J. O’Leary of Queen St, Kooringa, died last Wednesday, aged 62. He was a Burra Town Councillor for four years. He was of a kindly disposition and a true gentleman and was respected by all. He was a member of the Hibernian Soc. For over 40 years.

Burra Smelts. [Burra Copper Slag Smelting Co.] A company has been formed to re-smelt the tailing produced when the Burra Slag Extraction Co. crushed the large blocks of slag at the old smelts. Assays have been encouraging and a smelter arrived from Leigh Creek last week and will soon be erected. The process could also easily produce building blocks. The smelter could also be used to process thousands of tons of low-grade ore on the mine site. Some time ago an attempt was made to extract copper from this source by the magnetic process, but it failed. Several small shows of copper near Burra could also make use of the smelter. Some thousands of tons of material passed over by the Slag Extraction Co. could also be processed.

[Concluded on page 3 where it says all this is helped by a copper price which was over £100 per ton.]

[Margaret O’Brien died 11 January 1907 at Redruth, but her age is registered as 56. Marriage data suggests she was born Margaret Vaughen.]

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. On 8 January we expected the mine to be sold to an Adelaide-Melbourne Syndicate. A sale has been suggested as likely several times in recent years, but none seemed as likely as this most recent. When the news came through that it had failed property values in Burra fell and people hanging on in the town in the hopes of change have decided to move on. The pumping plant is now idle and the jigs forsaken. Shafts and drives have been abandoned and the mine more dormant than it has been since the old mine whistle ceased. The directors are blamed for this sad state of affairs, rightly or wrongly, and the Government is to be approached to see if they can make an arrangement with them to get the property working. [The writer hints at various things that he doesn’t spell out, but certainly believed that the directors have botched the whole operation and had employed a manager who had undoubtedly erred.]

‘During the past six months over £1,227-19-8 has been expended in so-called development – we call it pig-rooting of the very worst kind – and in return about £334-2-2 was received.’

The writer believed the mine could have been developed allowing parties of miners to take sets on tribute and allowing them to put drives in new ground, properly timbered, the directors to find the timbering. Messrs Smith & Co. ought to be approached while the pumping plant is still intact at the site.

‘We venture to say that there are tributers on the mine whose experience places them head and shoulders above the present manager to take sole control of the proposed work.’

The tributers have made something like £400 - £500 this last ‘take’ by simply working up cast-off stuff. There is some talk of a London Co. being interested or of Block 10 Mine of Broken Hill, but all such must be taken with a grain of salt. Tributers have now been given the option of resuming work in the cutting as before.

A disgusted Adelaide shareholder writes re the Burra Mine, saying he understands the directors wanted 1⁄3 of the mine and the right to have three directors on the board. Those proposing to buy considered if the directors were not competent to manage it before they will not be now, and so withdrew their offer – demanding outright purchase or nothing. Shareholders in Burra should have met and demanded the mine be worked in a proper manner. Now the Government should step in with some capital.

‘Go for the directors straight out, do not be too gentlemanly.’

Court.

James Sampson Pryor, ‘the alleged manager of the Burra Mine’ was charged with unlawfully beating Frank Anthony Meyer West on 13 December 1906. The boy gave evidence that with other boys he had been sliding down a slate roof on the mine when Mr Pryor came along and chased him. He caught him in the coach shed and struck him with a stick several times, which broke. Roy Hammer, a somewhat older lad, gave evidence corroborating the above. John Smith also gave evidence and all agreed that the defendant had struck the boy, Frank, and had said ‘I’ll cut the blood out of you, you young scamp.’ (Or similar words.)

Mrs W. West, wife of W. West Sen. Gave evidence that on another occasion Pryor had threatened the boy, saying ‘I will cut his liver out.’

Pryor was unrepresented. He said he saw three little boys sliding up and down an old slate roof.

[The editor thought they were clever to slide up!]

He believed they were in danger on the old roof. He claimed he went after Frank to prevent an accident and with great emphasis said: ‘Hi ham the manager of the Mine.’

He rushed up and gave his own little boy one stroke and sent him to his mother crying.

The court fined the defendant £1 reduced to 10/- + costs: in all amounting to £2-11-0.

The Burra Institute. The committee met on Monday when Mr Winnall said the fence had been erected to the satisfaction of the committee. Mr Fuss, the President, reported the re-arranging of the flags in front of the building and that the tar-paving was in hand.

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co.

Since the failure to dispose of the mine things have gone very flat. On Monday a dozen men were bagging 10 tons of ‘Penny’s Dump’. 5 tons goes to Gawler and 5 tons to Melbourne for special treatment to see if arrangements can be made to treat the stuff other than by the water process which it must be admitted is useless for Burra ore. But there are not many hundreds of tons of this ore on the spot and not enough to warrant spending on machinery to treat it. A new rule has appeared at the mine that no one is to work on tribute unless approved by the ‘manager’.

‘Another Disgusted Shareholder’ writes accusing the directors of the Burra Burra Copper Co. of being dogs in a manger. Copper prices are over £100 a ton which 30 years ago would have kept the old mine going and enabled them to go down to a decent depth and to have opened up the sulphide bodies. The last shots fired at Morphett’s Shaft are said to have broken ore of 45%. Another old miner reports rich ore at the 300ft level of Peacock’s Shaft and there are other reports too. A mine in Queensland is said to be paying on 7% ore and that with cartage of scores of miles to the railway. The only inference to be drawn is that the directors are incompetent and should give way to better men.

Burra Railway Station.

Since the railway station platform has been fenced off and a charge made to enter, it has become fashionable to parade the platform in view of those not wealthy enough to purchase a ticket.

‘The other evening on of the girls was “doing the grand” when someone asked “Who’s she?”

“Oh that’s Miss So-and-So.”

“Oh, good gracious, there’s nothing in going onto the platform if she is allowed on it.”

Then Miss So-and-So, hearing the remark, flicked her dress some more, pouted her lips, put out her tongue, and put on a frill that completely nonplussed the one on the outside.’

The new arrangements have also barred cabbies from presenting themselves at carriage doors. Passengers now have to find their own way to the cabstand.

Mr Dunstan found work in the Burra Mines and with two others found the great malachite lode, which returned £612 per man for 8 weeks. Later with her husband she went to live at Bundaleer and later still on an exploring trip to the far north. Capt. Dunstan was near Cooper Creek where Bourke and Wills died. They then went into business for several years and later farmed near Mt Bryan and Mt Bryan East, living in the latter place about 28 years. They are now both buried at Hallett.

The remaining tributers are not doing so well and on Saturday three left to ‘crack stones’ for the Corporation.

Fires. There was a big fire on Mt Bryan Estate last Wednesday. It started on the TSR about two miles south of Hallett, possibly from a drovers’ camp at Gumbowie crab holes. It soon spread to the corner of the Gumbowie Paddock and then a SW change carried it towards Hallett in high grass. It reached a road in about a mile, but falling trees carried across Price’s Gully and it ran on for several miles. Back burning saved the Kerklo Paddock and Mr Norriss’s property. Towards evening it broke out again in the Gumbowie Paddock and was brought under control about 2 a.m. Thursday, though there was a later small outbreak. The Hallett Paddock lost c. 2,000 acres of grass and the Gumbowie Paddock about 200 acres. A few sheep were scorched in the former. It continues to burn in scrub, but is considered safe.

On Wednesday there was another fire near Wattlegrove. It got a good hold and headed for Firewood Creek, but fighters stopped it entering Mr Reid’s property. Messrs Thomas & Gare lost c. 250 acres of grass and others also lost some. It was first noticed just after the midday train for the north.

He picked up the tin and when he shook it, it burst into flames, burning his hands.

A fire started Thursday in Ullmann’s Paddock, east of Mt Bryan township and another broke out near the fire of the previous day, but neither did much harm. M-Cs Phelan and Clarke with a blacktracker have been looking for the person believed to be starting the fires by laying phosphorous.

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. Tributers are turning over some stuff, but it is hard work to get it up the incline to the old floors. The water has risen to its usual height and the pumping plant has been cleared away. The directors do not favour doing anything during the period of Mr Horn’s option, so it has been decided to treat the stuff in the Burra Creek near W. Finch’s. It is thought the directors will be out of pocket if they have to pay wages here. In some parts of the creek tributers have made fairly good wages, only not so far down.

Mt Bryan. Item on the local terminology.

Until a few years ago ‘Mt Bryan’ was taken to mean what we now call Mt Bryan East and the area of some seven or eight farms around the railway station was referred to as Mt Bryan Flat.

[The town at the railway station was laid out as a private town in 1878 under the name Mt Bryan. A contiguous subdivision was laid out by the Government in 1907 and called Mt Bryan East. This was obviously confusing given local usage applied that name to another locality. Officially the whole town became Mt Bryan in 1941.]

The Government has purchased a large area for closer settlement. There are already new farms at Petherton. The article goes on to refer to the pegging out of the Government Town without naming it and predicts a great future for the centre.

Kooringa Methodist Tennis Club Concert last Friday was a cut above the ordinary. £12 has now been raised. Mr G.

Farrell’s Flat Sports on the previous Monday are reported in almost 2 columns. They were mostly flat and hurdle races plus a high jump, throwing the weight, and a bowling contest.

Inquest. The inquest on Annie Lomman eventually was completed. Annie Lomman, daughter of Mr Lomman of Mt Bryan East was delivered of a daughter in Thames St on a Thursday and the child died the Saturday of the following week, when it was found dead in the mother’s bed. Dr Sangster performed an autopsy, which suggested asphyxiation, but was not conclusive. The jury found that death was by asphyxia with no blame attachable to anyone.

Marriage. Miss A. Prior will marry Mr Cuthbert James at World’s End Church on 3 April.

Entertainment. Alone in London will be staged at the Institute tonight.

Ice Cream vendors are having a bonzer time in Burra.

Halley’s Comet continues to occupy some people’s minds.

Burra Rifle Club. Fifty names are now enrolled. A range has yet to be decided upon.

Whyte Yarcowie Races are reported.

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. Jigging has commenced in the Burra Creek. The present price of copper should make it profitable for the company.

VX, 764 (2), 27 Mar. 1907, page 2 [Second use of number 764.]

Birth. On 7 March at Mrs Woollacott’s Maternity Home, Redruth, to Mr & Mrs D.A. Siegert of Hallett, a daughter, Rhubell May McDonald Siegert.

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. Jigging continues about two miles south of Burra on the Princess Royal property. About 6 jigs and as many men are working for wages and about a ton has been taken out.

VX, 764 (2), 27 Mar. 1907, page 3 [Second use of number 764.]

Burra Races are reported in 21⁄2 columns. Threatening rain, which ultimately did not fall, kept attendance down somewhat. The course was some two miles from Kooringa and was in good order, but a littler ain would have aided its preparation. Tote turnover was down £60 on last year and few ladies were seen on the lawn. The only accident occurred through carelessness in the last race when a horse ran into a post and lost an eye. The concert afterwards was well attended. The committee may have to draw on the club’s reserves from last year to balance the books, as acceptances and nominations were down.

Burra Smelts [Burra Copper Slag Smelting Co.] The furnace to treat the slag is now ready and work is to start after the holidays. In contrast with the outlay of the Burra Slag Extraction Co., behind which were Messrs Martin & Co., this company is poised to make a better profit. It is expected to extract 11⁄2% from stuff that went through the Burra Slag Extraction Co. process and there are hundreds of tons not touched which will go up to something like 50-60%. There will be no washing away of tailings and every bit of copper will be extracted. It is expected to run two shifts of at least six men each.

Football. First meeting of the Kooringa Football Club for the year is called for tomorrow.

Court.

M-C Phelan was attacked on Thursday night by a drunken sailor named James Barry at the back of the Royal Exchange Hotel in Aberdeen. Barry was fined £2 for using indecent language.

[Oddly there is no mention of a charge of assault!]

Cricket. At Terowie on Saturday Burra 112 defeated Petersburg 77.

‘A Lady Passenger’ writes that some ladies took the ‘Popular Cab’ to the races on Wednesday and were charged 2/-. Halfway there the horses got knocked up and on looking at them she wonders how they got that far! The ‘popular driver’ did not offer however, to refund half the money when they had to walk from there, though she believes some of the ladies got away without paying at all!

Hanson Methodist Church. Annual Harvest Thanksgiving Tea was held on Good Friday when c. 120 travelled from Burra by train and many others came by road. Tea ran from 4 to 8 p.m. and then there was a public meeting followed by supper from 9 to 11 p.m. The tea raised £12-1-4, the supper £2-2-6 and in all the event realised £18-19-3.

Halley’s Comet. No comet yet.

Tennis. The AGM of the Aberdeen Tennis Club was held in the German Schoolroom on 2 April. Of the three matches for the season, they won two and lost one. Finances showed they were 7/11⁄2 in credit. Elected: Captain, J. Richards; Vice-Captain, R.J. Galle; Secretary & Treasurer, P.A. Roach.

Roads. The district’s roads are in a very bad state with dust often 6” deep and potholes up to 1’ deep. Road grants need to be increased instead of decreased as for some years past.

Copper is quoted at £97-10-0 a ton.

Marriage. At world’s End on Wednesday Annie Pryor, daughter of W.H. Pryor of World’s End, married Cuthbert James, son of N. James of Baldina. Over 300 sat down to the wedding breakfast at the residence of the bride’s father. It was also the 55th anniversary of W.H. Pryor’s marriage. Mr & Mrs Pryor are both a fit 76 years old and both stayed up celebrating till 4 a.m.

[Mr C. Fuss responded to the health of the bride and groom proposed by Rev. S. Kessell.]

The evening passed with songs, music and numerous games, followed (surely unusually for a wedding) by addresses on The Sheep and Farming Industry by Messrs Quinn, Pryor, James and Irlam, before dancing – some of the sets being very well gone through. [There is a tinkettling performance mentioned, but the sequence of events as reported is not very clear.]

Marriage. Also on Wednesday the eldest daughter of Mr C. Duell married Mr R. Baynes and the newly married quartet went to Broken Hill by Thursday night’s express.

Rain on Friday and Saturday produced 160 pts and Burra creek flowed briefly.

Burra Smelts [Burra Copper Slag Smelting Co.] The furnace is expected to be got going on a trial basis this week. The North Mutrooroo Copper Co. has contracted to supply 1,500 tons of ore.

Redruth Court.

William Develaing issued a summons charging Thomas Philip Halls Jun. with abusive and insulting language. The evidence was conflicting and witnesses apparently changed their stories so the case was dismissed.

Accident. Julius Kiekebusche, the second son of Emil Kiekebusche, of Baldina, was thrown out of his sulky on the way home from Burra on Monday evening, about 11 miles from Burra and 5 miles from home. He managed to walk a few yards, but then collapsed and was not found for 12 hours. He was found by J.G. Rooke and brought into the Burra Hospital where he remains unconscious.

VX, 767, 17 Apr. 1907, page 2

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. It has been generally very quiet with very little tributing work going on. Work in the creek about two miles south of Burra is progressing, but the ore bed is cutting out and not much more will be done there. It was expected this would be profitable, but with men on wages of 3/- to 6/8 a day it will likely make a loss. The last returns were 61⁄2%. The option said to be held over the property by Mr Horne expires in about a month.

Foxes are becoming numerous in the east.

A Dog Poisoner has struck again in Burra. Nine succumbed on Saturday.

Burra Institute. The gas lights failed at the Institute on Thursday night during the performance of the Ada Delroy Company. 24lb of carbide ought to have served, but ‘the large lights above the stage consumes more carbide than the lights are useful.’ The performance itself was very favourably reviewed. It was the return of this company after c. 10 years.

Messrs Norman & John (Curley) Burns were farewelled in Mr F. Harris’s rooms on Saturday night. They are leaving tonight for Broken Hill. Speakers included L. Penrose, E.W. Crewes, O.G. Walker, C. McLaren, J. Moy & P. Milner.

Rev. W.F. James returned to the district recently. He conducted the service at Hanson on Sunday afternoon and at Redruth in the evening and gave a lecture To England and Back at Hanson on Monday and at Redruth on Tuesday. He only returned from a health trip to England about eight weeks ago. Mr James has been stationed at Jamestown.

World’s End. An excursionist reports on a trip, taking of the scenery and waterfalls and the pedestrian bridge swung between large trees. Homesteads in the area are well kept, stock is well looked after and the land well farmed. Everyone was busy whether attending to the wheat crops or to cows and dairy produce.

Miss Ella Green has been visiting her parents at World’s End and has now returned to Pupil Teachers’ College in Grote St Adelaide.

Obituary. James Henry Hocking, son of John Hocking late of Burra, died at Broken Hill. He had been suffering from consumption for some time. [Not readily identifiable.]

Accident. Mr Julius Kiekebusche has been unconscious now for eight days. At times he is very uneasy and at other times he is quiet. No bones are broken and nothing can be done but wait. Mr Kiekebusche’s father is of course greatly distressed and said he had urged his son to come home before dark and believed he would have done so had not business prevented him. Mr J.G. Rooke who found the injured man said the horse was a splendid traveller, but rather hot-headed and lively. The injured man is unchanged as we go to press.

Burra District Council

Thomas Lomman was appointed pound-keeper at Copperhouse to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Mrs Ellen Sanders.

‘Short & Sharp’

Splendid pictures of the World’s End Bridge are available from the Record office.

Burra Town Council, Monday

C. & A. Fuss were allowed to erect a verandah in front of their shop.

Mushrooms are plentiful just now.

Burra Smelts [Burra Copper Slag Smelting Co.] The machinery was set in motion on Monday and will employ about 17 or 18.

Salvation Army farewelled Capt. Coombes & Lieut. Crocker on Friday. They are leaving after 13 months service. Farewell services were held on Sunday. Capt. Coombes goes to her home in NZ for three months’ rest and Lieut. Crocker to Nailsworth pro tem and then to Glenelg. Staff-Capt McNee & Lieut. Wiseman will replace them in Burra.

Stray dogs have been worrying sheep again. William Finch lost 10 of 14 worried a few days ago and P.L. Killicoat has also had trouble.

St Mary’s annual picnic was held at Sod Hut on J.C. Sandland’s property on Wednesday.

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. If the old slag can be made to pay at 11⁄2% copper then surely a handsome profit can be made from the thousands of tons of 4-5% ore at the Burra Mine.

W.A. Horn has cabled from London his intent of exercising his option. Under the terms of option he will spend a considerable sum prospecting and may subsequently purchase at a price agreed upon. The first copper was found in 1845 and in 291⁄2 years the company expended £2,241,170 and raised copper worth £4,749,224. In 1859 1,170 men were employed. Active operations ceased in 1877, but at different periods some work has been carried on. The property is now in the hands of a local company.

Women’s Work Exhibition Committee met at the Institute on Friday.

Obituary. Mrs Tilbarry, mother of the Mayoress, Mrs W.C.L. West, died at Largs Bay on 15 April.

VX, 768, 24 Apr. 1907, page 3

Burra Racing Club. W.H. Hardy (Hon. Sec.) presided at a meeting where the recent slight loss was ascribed to the meeting being late in the season so that horses arrived in Burra much run down. The club still has a credit balance at the bank.

Braefoot Estate Land Board Allotments for 15 blocks are printed along with those for 13 blocks at Cartapo & part Wandillah Estate and 9 blocks at part Koonoona Estate.

Obituary. Julius Kiekebusch, who was injured in an accident on the World’s End road about two weeks ago regained consciousness on Saturday and appeared to be recovering well on Sunday and Monday, but convulsions overtook him about midday and he died. He was a member of the Burra Orchestra and had recently composed The Phosphate Waltz.

Burra Smelts [Burra Copper Slag Smelting Co.] The men who signed on for work there demanded higher wages than the 7/- agreed to and on Friday threatened a strike. Mr Kittell, the manager, listened carefully to them, but stood firm and on Saturday they signed again at the original wages.

The work of firing up the furnace was undertaken on Monday and the first charge was prepared and went off without a hitch with molten slag flowing in about an hour. Among those witnessing the scene was John Sampson who saw the first charge drawn from the old smelting works 57 years ago. There will be three 8-hour shifts and a total employment of about 18. The new process is a great invention and cheap to operate. The blast is provided by a 17 h.p. oil engine with 9 oz pressure. The water is recycled, though evaporative losses are likely to be about 3,000 gallons a day. It is built to treat 30 tons of copper per day.

VX, 769, 1 May 1907, page 2

Apology. William Jenkin Davey proprietor of the Burra Record apologises to James Sampson Pryor the manager of the Burra Mine for having published libellous statements in the paper from time to time in 1906-7 reflecting on his honesty and reputation as a mine manager and his cruelty in thrashing a child.

‘such statements were and are untrue in substance and in fact.’

Acknowledgement. The paper acknowledges receipt of a total of £25-16-7 from various sources to help meet any expenses that might be incurred between J.S. Pryor and W.J. Davey.

Aberdeen Ballast Quarry. The scarcity of railway trucks has reduced the workers at the ballast quarry to half-time. About 20 are employed: down from 24.

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. Eleventh Half-yearly Report. The property is in a dormant state, but has perhaps better prospects than ever before. Mr W.A. Horn’s £1,000 option does not expire till 13 May 1907. It is proposed to spend £15,000 in nine months if purchase goes ahead. It is to be hoped the mine will be completely dewatered and that a smelter will be one of the first things undertaken.

[Note that in the issue of 20 Feb. 1907 the option was cited as one of £10,000!]

The venture in the Burra Creek is turning out stuff at 5-6% and this will not pay expenses. The men will do OK, being on wages, but the company will incur a considerable loss.

Bert Knevitt expects soon to go east to take oversight of Mr R. McBride’s Finger Post station.

Obituary. The late Mrs Tilbarry leaves two children: Mrs W.C.L. West of Burra Mines and Mr R. Tilbarry, stationmaster at Largs Bay. There are 9 grandchildren.

Obituary. The late Julius Kiekebusch had a largely attended funeral at the Baldina Lutheran Church where Rev. Ridel officiated and Rev. S. Kessell (Methodist) also spoke. Burial was in the adjacent graveyard.

Obituary. David Thomas Jenkins, aged 21, of Canowie, died in the Burra Hospital on Thursday of typhoid fever. [Born 1 August 1885 at Petersburg: died 25 April 1907 at Kooringa, residence Canowie.]

Luke Day’s cart, driven by a lad named A. Moore, overturned near Mitchell’s Flat on Saturday and he and a little boy named Blott were thrown out, but escaped injury, as did the cart.

VX, 769, 1 May 1907, page 3

Burra Smelts [Burra Copper Slag Smelting Co.] Despite early signs of success, some difficulties have been encountered. The slag will after all require a flux. It had been thought the previous process would have removed this necessity. An addition of limestone will be needed. The mat copper so far produced tries at 37%: which is considered satisfactory.

Mt Bryan notes. Some new farmers are moving in on the newly provided blocks, though there are grumblings that some went to those who ‘have got more land than they know what to do with already.’ The new township allotments don’t seem to have attracted buyers. The stationmaster is E. Rumball.

[The new town allotments were in the new Government town surveyed adjacent to the original private town and confusingly officially designated Mt Bryan East.]

Burra Institute. The librarian, Mr A. Davey, went to stow some periodicals in the Institute cellar the other day and found 18 bottles of stout and 3 of port – apparently they have been there for over 25 years – possibly from the laying of the foundation stone. (Mr Davey is a teetotaller.)

Burra Defence Rifle Club is keen to get going, but the Government is dilatory in assisting the organisers. So far Capt. Lord of the Burra Hotel has given a gold medal and Mr B.W. Pearse of Caroona has given a silver cup to the value of £3-3-0. The contest to decide the winner will take about 12 months.

St Mary’s annual vestry meeting. The pipe organ fund is now in debt £56. (The organ cost £350 in 1905.) The rectory fund is in debt £78 (From the debt of £400 incurred in the renovations of 1905.) After nearly 30 years as organist Miss Cave has resigned and Rev. Ebbs proposed to appoint W.B. Page as organist and choirmaster. J. Jordan becomes superintendent of the Sunday school. The Sunday school has a balance in hand of £5-9-0.

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. Tributers have paid the directors £164-14-1 for the last six months and the results of prospecting yielded £173-15-1: little more than the royalty from tributers.

VX, 770, 8 May 1907, page 2

Partnership. The existing partnership of R. Urwin & A.B. Hiddle will be dissolved by mutual consent on 1 June 1907 owing to the retirement of A.B. Hiddle from the firm.

Burra Benevolent Society AGM is called for Thursday 16 May at the Institute.

Chess Club. A move to restart the Chess Club was made on Saturday evening. Permission will be sought to meet every Friday at the Institute. President, Dr Sangster; Secretary, G. Scott.

Acknowledgements. Donations to W.J. Davey re the J.S. Pryor libel case have now reached £47-6-2.

Burra Defence Rifle Club. The Government has at last gazetted the Burra Rifle Club and the rifles should soon be received. The pits for the 200 and 300-yard ranges are being got ready. Targets will be of shutter design, manipulated from the pit by the marker. [There is no indication of the site though.]

Butchers’ licences granted to Messrs John Wise, O’Leary Bros. And H.E. Rabbich.

A Bolt. Dan Mahoney, employed by W.T. Truscott, butcher of Kooringa, was thrown from the cart at the Bon Accord Hotel on Thursday, when the horse plunged forward. He required several stitches to a severe cut under the lip. The horse then made off towards Kooringa, but was soon halted by workmen.

Burra Smelts [Burra Copper Slag Smelting Co.] There was a false start on Thursday, but the problem was rectified and a second start with different fluxing arrangements was made during the night and a good run resulted. There was a shut down on Monday due to the failure of the leather of the pump, which will be replaced by a metal valve. The oil engine is not running well and is the likely source of the next trouble. The run produced 4-5 tons of matte.

Trip to Kangaroo Island. There is a 3⁄4 column report. [Author not stated.]

Karkulta Mine is 15 miles south of Burra, which worked for c. 12 years and engaged 20-30 miners. Some stuff remains on site and a shaft went down 40 fathoms. Surface rights have been sold, but SAMA retains mineral rights.

VX, 770, 8 May 1907, page 3

Football. Saturday at Victoria Park: Kooringa 12.16 (88) defeated Ramblers 2.3 (15).

Letters to the editor re the libel case with J.S. Pryor are printed.

‘Sympathy’ extends sympathy ‘in your recent trouble’.

‘We hope that you may long be spared to vindicate right and expose wrong wherever you may find it for the good of the public.’

‘Cousin Jack from Moonta’ [in dialect] writes to say he “ ’ope that your friends will come forward and pay the bill for ’ee. I do see by your paaper that you have ‘ad over £25 sent ’ee, and I do feel purty pleased at this ’ere, because it is better than tributing with a surly old boss to meddle with ’ee, and try to clip your wings and run up costs.’

‘Justice’ considers the editor ‘a MARTYR to the CAUSE of TRUTH.’ And trusts the day will come when ‘TRUTH and STRAIGHTFORWARDNESS obtain the mastery over hypocrisy, vice and unscrupulous dealing however thickly such undesirable attributes may be covered over by deceit.’

[A donation was enclosed.]

‘Creek Ore’ writes with a small donation and would have sent more if he had ‘any valuable assets, such as was lately said to be found in the Burra Creek (vdie [sic] last balance-sheet of the B.B.C. Co.)’

‘Shareholder’ writes thanking the editor for his stand. ‘Your references to the property have not been shaked in the least notwithstanding last week’s paper’. He encloses an amount collected since the last issue.

Burra Town Council.

The curator of the cemetery reports the wood at the morgue requires painting. [A reference on 22 May suggests ‘the morgue’ was actually the mortuary chapel at the cemetery.] He also requested a small allowance on account there were no burials in March or April.

It was resolved that four acetylene lamps be got and fixed to the lanterns now in use.

Mr McLaren is to remove the obstacle on the road at the rear of his premises.

Notice. Apology. I, William Jenkin Davey, proprietor of the Burra Record, hereby apologise to James Sampson Pryor, manager of the Burra Mine, for having made and published the libellous statements which have from time to time during the years 1906-07 appeared in my paper reflecting on his honesty and reputation as a mine manager and taxing him with unwarrantable cruelty in thrashing a child of tender years and I further say that such statements were and are untrue in substance and in fact.

Dated April 29 1907.

Messrs Urwin & Hiddle’s Sale to dissolve the partnership will continue fro five more days – closing May 18 1907 and the partnership will be dissolved by mutual consent 1 June 1907.

W.B. Page has grown a fine large lettuce of c. 3lb of the White Heart Cos self-hearting variety – 10 weeks from seed.

Burra Show Society met on Friday and decided to hold the Sheep-dog Field Trials on 14 August and the show on Wednesday 25 September despite Kapunda and Hamley Bridge moving to that date without consideration – Burra having used that date for the last ten years.

Lisle Pearce, son of C.J. Pearce, left Burra on Saturday for Yongala where he will fill a position in Messrs Hodby & Co.’s store. He is a steady and trustworthy young man and won the confidence of his employers while working for Drew & Crewes here. On behalf of employees there Mr J. Bentley made a presentation of a handsome travelling rug on Friday.

The Smelts. Since repairs the furnace has been running very well. An expert from the city on Saturday considered that Mr Kittell was doing the best thing possible under the circumstances. After this run the company will be in a position to know how the financial position will stack up.

Football. On Wednesday Aberdeen 3.6 defeated Ramblers 2.3.

## VX, 771, 15 May 1907, page 3

Copper Find. Messrs Geach, Cartwright & W. West Sen. have found a well-defined copper lode of high grade ore (samples 25%) about half a mile south of the Princess Royal. It runs north-south and is some eight feet wide. Copper is present in green carbonate, blue [word missing] and black oxide and yellow ore. It is eight miles south of Burra with a good road. A long lease has been secured and a syndicate will be formed directly.

Empire Day. A committee has been formed for celebrations on Victoria Park with all of the town’s children and those from Copperhouse School to attend. Sports and provision committees have been established.

Obituary. Mr Edwin Boulton died on Monday aged 72. He was a resident of 37 years, arriving in SA in the Carnatic from the Parish of Hawkesbury in Gloucestershire in 1857. Mrs Boulton has been in Burra Hospital since suffering an apoplectic fit about nine months ago and is unable to do anything for herself. There are three sons and three daughters: Archibald (Burra), Edwin (unknown), Henry (Broken Hill), Annie (single), Mrs A. Beaven & Mrs J.A. Knevitt (Burra).

‘Short & Sharp’

Target for the Burra Rifle Club’s 200 & 300 yard range is placed in position.

The Smelts did not work last week. There is trouble with the plant owing to the presence of so much iron.

Burra Mine. The Burra Burra Copper Co. has practically ceased to work the mine as Mr W.A. Horn has exercised his option over it and is making arrangements to proceed with work under new conditions. It is expected development work will start almost at once and the new company is expected to spend £15,000 within nine months from Monday last. Mr Davis the new manager has arrived.

Mr J.S. Pryor and the Burra Record.

In the last issue several letters appeared which reflected on that gentleman. We take the first opportunity of refuting the statements in the said letters the import of which escaped our notice in the rush of business. There was not the slightest compulsion about our signing the apology which appears in another column. Mr Pryor displayed a genuine Christian spirit throughout the whole proceedings and accepted the apology mentioned. We are sorry the letters appeared and we do not believe there is a word of truth in any of them so far as they reflect on Mr Pryor’s character.

Tenders are called by A.B. Hiddle for two houses freehold property in Bridge St. One is of six rooms with a large kitchen, cellar, bathroom, wash-house, stable and water service from a good well.

Obituary. Grace Richards, relict of the late Thomas Richards and sister of Messrs William and W.H. Prior of Baldina, died last week at Broken Hill. She lived in Burra with her husband in the early days of the town. [This may be incorrect. A Grace Prior born 16 October 1844 married John Richards in 1861 and would appear to be the person dying in 1907. W.H. Prior had two sisters called Grace, both of whom died aged 8 months in 1866 & 1869 respectively. If ‘the early days of the town’ means anything then Grace Prior hardly fits and we may be faced with Grace Gilbert or Gilbart who had children in the District of the Murray in 1849 & 1851 and was married to Thomas Richards!]

Mt Bryan. There is a half column report on how Mt Bryan has changed as a result of closer settlement.

Mt Bryan, at one time quiet, has advanced into activity. The beautiful tracts of country which could carry ten times more people lay idle until the present Government seen it wise [sic] to buy up land to keep farmers in the state. Until the past two years Mt Bryan had been a place of retrogression and but for a little lamb and wheat the local railway station was quiet. The church had lost nearly all of its one-time good congregations. The once good farms had given way to sheep. The change that has come extends from three or four miles south of Hallett almost down to Burra. Settlers have come and it is hoped will stay. In conversation one cannot but admire their refined manner and genial disposition and when one hears of their hardships in the northern parts of the state one feels they are men of grit. Nice homes are being built and more goods delivered to the Mt Bryan railway station in the last twelve months than in the previous twenty years. Settlers are hard at it late and early improving their farms. Business flourishes and two of Burra’s largest storekeepers run there three days a week and also one from Hallett. A store if built in Mt Bryan would do well. Alterations have been asked for in the station yard for wheat and other heavy traffic. Hotel business is brisk and church congregations are large. A tennis club has been formed with a nice court in the station yard. A Literary Society still exists and recently a meeting formed an Agricultural Bureau. A cricket club will soon be formed. Mt Bryan is one of the happiest and busiest of districts outside the metropolis.

Cooper’s ‘Little Wonder’ sheep shearing machine trial at Brewery Flat passed off nicely. It is a simple machine, well-suited to small farmers with 100 to 3,000 sheep. Set up for two men, it can shear 100 to 120 a day and the engine can be used for other on-farm tasks.

Burra Coursing Club has had to abandon its meeting as it needed 16 dogs to be viable and only 9 were entered.

Burra started three men short and Manoora with its full complement seemed about twice as heavy. The news of the result was despatched to Manoora by carrier pigeon.

Rev. Toshach’s appearance on Monday at the Institute attracted fewer than expected due to the stormy weather. Those who stayed home missed a rare treat. The singing was good and Rev. Toshach has the ability to carry his listeners from laughter and merriment to tears.

Photograph. There is a rare appearance of a photograph in the paper this issue. It is of the roadster stallion Bellatrix, owned by Henry Roach of the Burra Mill. There is a notice that he will travel the district for the 1907 season. This is the valuable horse that had to be rescued after falling into an underground tank some 18 months ago.

Parliamentary Visit to Burra, Friday 16 August, and Labor Party Social.

[Report runs to about 43⁄4 columns.]

At the last minute the Premier, Rt Hon. T. Price was unable to come, but the delegation comprised the Chief Secretary, Commissioner of Crown Lands & Messrs Denny, Goode, Jackson, Miller & Newland. They arrived by the midday train and were met by members of the Town Council and Thomas Davis, President of the local Labor Party Branch. They went to the school, where the Cadet Corps formed a guard of honour and performed a drill. The school was then inspected and Dr Sangster, as Chairman of the Burra School Board of Advice, raised the matter of the school being made a Continuation School as it would save much expense for parents if children could complete their education locally. Mr G. Scott, the head teacher, gave a history of the school – there are 283 presently on the roll.

The children sang The Song of Australia and Joyce Taplin recited Excelsior.

The visitors then went to the Reformatory, the Mine and the Burra Hospital, among other places.

A sumptuous spread was provided at Miss Vivian’s Court House Hotel, and in the evening the party went to the Institute, where they gave addresses on the current state of politics interspersed with songs. The hall was decorated and bedecked with Labor Party slogans.

Chief Secretary, Hon. Kirkpatrick said the closer settlement scheme was a major plank of the party. Owners of large estates were being fairly compensated: where necessary with a fair price + 15%. Civil servants were getting 7/- a day. The NT problem was being solved and would save them £120,000 p.a. The Party was still pursuing Legislative Council reform and wanted to see household suffrage. At present the Legislative Council represented only 2/7 of the population.

Commissioner of Crown Lands, Hon. L. O’Loughlin (a Liberal in coalition with Labor) said he was glad that despite the lack of compulsory purchase they had been able to buy up Petherton, Shafton, Braefoot and Cartapo, among other estates, for closer settlement. They had only about 5,000,000 acres of agricultural land within Goyder’s Line and therefore these large estates could not be allowed to lock up this limited agricultural land ‘to no good purpose’. He also supported Legislative Council reform.

W.J. Denny.

His speech was devoted to the then current clash between the House of Assembly and the Legislative Council over the reform of the latter.

W. Miller continued on the same theme.

Mr Goode continued on the franchise and on other matters currently blocked by the Upper House, which was ‘on strike’.

Mr Jackson continued on the franchise.

Mr J. Newland basically thanked electors for his recent success and for the success of this Labor Party Social as well as endorsing the reforms already canvassed. The Party had had some local concerns brought to their attention, which would be addressed on their return to Adelaide.

Mr O’Loughlin proposed a vote of thanks to those assisting in making the meeting a success.

Mr Miller proposed the vote of thanks to the chairman.

Mr Davis suitably replied.

Refreshments and a ball followed.

Editorial on The New Tariff.

The new tariff was discussed at a Public meeting at the institute on Friday. It was not as largely attended as it should have been. The tax on all imported articles will increase the cost of living 3/- to 5/- a week and in many cases more. Why is this increase in Government income necessary? To pay the Parliamentary salaries.

[This column of condemnation is not, on the whole, well argued, being vague, generalised, and lacking in carefully argued logic.]

Accident. Charley Preiss fell asleep on his way to Baldina last Friday and the horses fell into the deep creek on the turn towards Barker’s. One horse fell on top of another one and the wagon became jammed in the creek and needed seven or eight horses to pull it out. A third horse escaped and went home. The animals in the creek were both injured and one is not expected to recover.

[The article makes no mention of injury to Charley or to his fate!]

Obituary. John Honan, an old resident of Mutooroo, aged c. 52 has died of cancer of the jaw. He leaves a wife and four children, the youngest aged 14. Mrs M. Honan of the Paddock, Kooringa, is his mother.

Tennis. The AGM of Kooringa Methodist Tennis Club on Wednesday reported it was in credit £10-0-6.

Milner; Treasurer, Miss G. Pearce. Court to be tar dressed.

J.E. Greenwood has commenced business in Kooringa as a tinsmith and ironworker, next to Pederson’s cash boot shop. He worked here some time ago before going to Adelaide and Gawler.

VX, 787, 4 Sep. 1907, page 3

The Tariff. There is 12⁄3 column of detail of the meeting chaired by the Mayor, W.C.L. West.

Cr J. Wise moved a long motion in opposition to the proposed tariff. He considered how the tariff would affect primary industries, both agriculture and mining. Mr McGilchrist 2nd. He considered how it would affect the working man in particular. The tariff is supposed to protect local industry, but it is absurd. To protect one small wire netting manufacturer in NSW the whole country will pay £3 per ton duty on imported netting. There will be 3d per lb on tobacco and 6d a lb on tobacco leaf. 3d per gallon is added to kerosene and there are 15 million gallons of duty free kerosene in stock on which importers will make £137,000 etc.

Mr Winnall said that though intended to protect Australian industry it also ‘protected’ those things it was impossible for us to produce.

Dr Sangster also spoke in support of the motion, as the burden would fall unequally on the poor.

Motion carried.

Cr W.G. Neville then moved a motion condemning the recent increase in Parliamentary salaries. 2nd E.K. Collins and carried unanimously.

The propositions as carried are to be forwarded to Sir Frederick Holder, MP for the district.

St Joseph’s. The ladies arranging the church bazaar held a successful dance on Wednesday in the Institute and the £5 nett profit will be distributed amongst the stalls.

Michael Tobin. The WA Government has sent a substantial cheque to the parents of the late Michael Tobin as some compensation for the death of their son, together with a letter acknowledging the high regard in which he was held in the 13 years or so he was in their service.

Burra Defence Rifle Club. Matches are reported. R. Fairchild won the vernier that was given as the prize, though it is thought he rather tricked the handicapper by having a practice target at Leighton unknown to the handicapper.

Firing on Monday saw I.A. Macindoe 97 and J. Clarke 93, in the lead for Capt. Lord’s medal and J. Clarke 103 and W. Lomman 100, leading for the Caroona Cup.

Football. On Saturday Kooringa beat the Ramblers when each played with about half a team plus substitutes. [Scores are not cited.]

Burra-Adelaide Cycle Race.

On Saturday a fairly large crowd gathered in Market Square to see off the riders in the bicycle road race to Adelaide. It was reported that tacks had been strewn over the road about a mile from town and as there were a number of punctures just about there, it was probably true. 42 riders left Burra. All went well and the worst injury to a rider was to McDonald, who was so fatigued he fell getting off his bike after finishing and cut his hand badly. Fastest time was A. McDonald (WA) in 6 hrs 10 59 3.5 [three fifths of a second?] and the winner on handicap was H.G. Williams in 6 hr 14 5 2.5 with a 33 minute handicap.

The Burra Show was held at Victoria Park on Wednesday last in fine weather and proved to be the best since the society’s resuscitation. The day began drizzly, but cleared by 10 o’clock. The gate takings were £70. Much of the success was due to the thoroughness of Secretary, John McLaren.

Bert Opperman and his brother dug out four young foxes on Wandillah last Saturday. They have caught 14 in the same area in 12 months.

Attempted Suicide. Last Friday the three small children of Fanny McWaters missed their mother and despite a search and enquiries could not find her. In the early hours of Saturday morning they found her bed not slept in and began looking again at dawn. They eventually went to a well in Paxton Square at the rear of the house and found their mother at the bottom. They informed Mr Luke Day, who sent one to the police and returned to the scene. M-C Clarke was lowered, but when at the bottom could do little as he had put his shoulder out in descending. J.H. James of Kadina assisted. M-C Clarke was brought up and then Mrs McWaters. She said she had jumped in because she was starving and Cummings, with whom she had been living, was coming home. So much rubbish had been thrown down the well that there was a surface layer over the water that supported her. Even so it is remarkable that she survived given the rocky projections on the walls. Dr Sangster sent her to the hospital when she had been extricated from the bedsteads, tubs, kerosene tins and broken bottles at the bottom. Her injuries proved to be minor.

Accident. G. Burton of Mt Bryan was badly shaken and required medical treatment after running into sheep on his bicycle when going home the other night. The sheep apparently were camped on the main road for the night!

Philanthropy. After the pathetic McWaters’ incident last week when five children were left friendless and hungry with no one to say a kind word Joe (‘Battler’) Halls [11] appealed to his parents to take them in, promising to share his tucker with them if they did so. Mr & Mrs T.P. Halls did take them in and cared for them. Mrs Halls washed and ironed their clothes and Joe cleaned all their boots. They were perfectly turned out for their appearance in court. [See below.] Mr & Mrs Day sent along food to help them in the first stage of their troubles.

Redruth Court, Friday morning.

Fanny McWaters was charged on the information of M-C Clarke with attempting to murder herself on 16 November by throwing herself down a well in Paxton Square. Clarke said he was asked to go and see about getting Mrs McWaters out of it. He descended the well and the woman was subsequently brought up. She said she had committed the act because she expected Cummings home and there was no food in the house for the children. She was not called to give evidence and was bound over to keep the peace for six months on her own recognisance of £5.

Before the same bench the children: Morton Harold (11), Otto William (8), Dorothy (8), William Henry (5), Birdie Evelyn (5) and George Stanley William (3) were charged with being neglected children. Evidence was tendered that the mother Fanny McWaters was addicted to drink and her home was visited by men on one occasion from 9 to 11 November she had left her house and children and had subsequently tried to do away with herself. The children were sent to the Industrial School till age 18. The mother made no demonstration at the decision, but asked for custody of the baby aged three, but this was refused.

Mt Bryan East Public School held its picnic 19 November in Messrs Thomas & Gare’s paddock about two miles from the school with plenty of shade and water. All kinds of sport were played by both students and adults. A ladies v. gentlemen cricket match was regarded as great fun when the men had to wear women’s apparel and use a pick-handle as a bat. Walking blindfolded for the rooster in the box was one of the most amusing events and the bird was won by Mr B.H.K. Dunstan. He gave it back to be contested for by the ladies and it was then won by Mrs B.H.K. Dunstan who also gave it back to be tried for by the younger ladies and this time it went to Miss G. Taylor.

Redruth Court

Michael Roberts was charged with not taking a direct line to market with 5,000 travelling sheep as required under the Act. He said that although guilty it was an unintended offence. He explained that he was a stranger to SA and in attempting to change from Jamestown Market (which was full) to Crystal Brook he had doubled back. The ranger was clearly not buying this excuse, but the bench which could have fined him £50 settled for £2-10-0 plus costs to bring the total to £4-8-0.

Burra Sports have been postponed from Boxing Day to Easter Monday. Boxing Day has many other attractions in other places and it is impossible for riders and runners to get to the sports and then to their holidays as well. For farmers it is also a busy time.

Mt Bryan Agricultural Bureau met on 18 November when the discussion was on fallow. It was mostly about how to fallow and how much breaking up of the soil should be involved. The view was that finely tilled soil was highly desirable. Speakers generally agreed that ‘fallow could not be worked too much’. Moisture was best conserved on well-worked fallow.

Burra Town Council Ratepayers’ Meeting will be held tonight when the Mayor will read his report.

Obituary. Mr E. (Emanuel) Fredrick who for some years kept a boarding house in Thames St died on Friday morning. Some weeks ago he developed trouble swallowing and then refused food. He got weaker and became mentally deranged.

He leaves a wife and 10 adult daughters: Mesdames Walter Morgan (Ironmine), Robert Williams (Queenscliff), Thomas McBride (Redcliffe Station), Arthur Jordan (Gawler), D. Kelly (Pt Pirie), William Morgan (Kooringa) and the Misses Lottie (Pt Pirie) and Alice, Myrtle & Gertie at home.

Burra Waterworks. It is a long time since the system has been extended, but now pipes are being laid in Thames and other streets. It had been thought the reservoir would not cater for expansion, but we now know the problem lay with the pump and as this has been made more powerful expansion is possible and will be lucrative, as in many cases the water will not be used, but will be charged for. The aim is to extend water to all streets.

Editorial on Christmas, which has the usual platitudes before turning to local affairs.

As far as Burra is concerned there is no industry in progress that would promise better times ahead. The mine is still inactive and likely to stay so. Despite hearing of a change of ownership and a substantial deposit put down, arrival of boring plants, no satisfactory work has resulted. We would not be surprised to hear of work being abandoned in the near future. Morphett’s Shaft was retimbered and a start was about to be made to unwater the mine when copper prices slumped from £104 to under £70 per ton. Work was curtailed and the men at the shaft were laid off.

The closer settlement scheme has been more promising and has placed some 35 families on properties within a few miles of Burra.

Burra School juniors had a tea party on Wednesday given by their teacher, Miss Cleggett, assisted by parents.

Burra School Break-up last Friday is reported in 1 column. The head teacher, Mr G. Scott gave his annual report. The program of songs is printed. There were 329 on the roll and an average attendance of 230 (For the previous four years it had been 291, 269, 254 & 244.) The new regulations requiring so many days a week instead of a quarter had led to many regularly missing one day a week. The prize list is printed. There were 21 boys in the Cadet Corps.

Characteristics of the 1907 paper.

Page 1.

The usual large advertisements both local and other.

Page 2.

Some larger advertisements along with public notices and small advertisements, though there was less of the latter than in past times. Editorials almost vanished. There was an annoying interspersing of printed advertisements with the news.

Page 3.

Correspondence from other towns. Sporting events are reported: at length in the case of football. Overall little evidence that the paper went out to get news – rather that it waited for it to be sent in. Court cases are mostly briefly reported and the Town Council reports are brief and uncontroversial. There are lots of boring repeated advertisements in small print and while the size of the humorous fillers varies greatly, they are sometimes substantial.

Page 4.

Large advertisements and usually one column of Town Information giving who’s who, timetables for trains and a diary of regular meetings for associations, lodges etc.

Numbering of issues in 1907

Volume VX continued for the whole year, having started 12 July 1905.

The year began with Volume VX Number 753 on 2 January 1907

And continued to Volume VX Number 803 on 28 December 1907

Within this series the number 764 was used twice.

Christmas Holidays in Burra. Christmas Day was very hot and Boxing Day was one of the worst for many years. There was a hot sultry and windy morning, but in the afternoon the change came with thunder, lightning and a short, heavy shower of rain. The weather was cooler from then on. Christmas Eve had not been as bustling as the previous year, but trade was better. The Salvation Army serenaded at various places with carols.

A good attendance saw £14 taken at the gate and people came from as far as Petersburg and Morgan and some £26 was collected. Most of the prize money went to J.C. O’Dea of Booborowie and J. Quinn of World’s End. There was a ball in the evening at C. Green’s residence.

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. The company shares are down to 1/3.

There will be a general clean up at the mine and boring will cease. Rumours of something not very encouraging to residents or shareholders have been around for some time. Some time ago the Kooringa Prospecting Syndicate took up an option over the property and was going to spend some £15,000 in developing the mine. A couple of boring plants were erected and after much trouble a start was made, but there were many problems, and ultimately little headway. A fortnight ago some sulphide ore was found, but not sufficient to excite interest. All the old timber etc. will be handed over to the Burra Burra Copper Co. and all hope of the mine starting again seems gone. Boring will probably cease on 15 February when the contract expires.

## VX, 808, 5 Feb. 1908, page 2

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co.

The announcement of the proposed stoppage of the boring operations means there is now no hope of the Burra Mine being tested and certainly not while copper is at its present low price. We still believe that with sufficient capital the mine would make a handsome profit.

Some 4-5 years ago, when the Burra Burra Copper Co. took over the mine property it was thought that mining would be revived. The old SAMA now has no mineral rights in the Burra Mine. The Copper Co. began well, but it was soon apparent that progress was not being made.

A few months ago Mr Horn, a well-known mining mad from Great Britain, came out and paid, it is said, a substantial deposit to hold an option over the mine for nine months, during which £15,000 was to be expended.

After many rumours, a couple of boring plants arrived and were erected. There was much trouble with them, but eventually they got going to look for the sulphide lode, said to lie at the bottom of the open cut. Time has revealed that nothing has been found to induce the Kooringa Prospecting Syndicate to proceed further. The men are busy taking down the plants, which will be done in a few days, and the mine will again present a desolate appearance.

Four bores have been put down and considerable development below the surface in close proximity to the old workings. The mine was partially unwatered, but only to a depth of some 10 to 12 feet. The advantage this offered was lost and after a while pumping operations ceased. The retimbering of Morphett’s Shaft is work that will last forever. When this shaft was cleared out a few months ago hopes were high that the mine would be completely unwatered and driving at depth undertaken, but copper prices fell suddenly from £105 to £90 and then to the present £61 per ton. This caused orders for machinery to be cancelled and since then things have gone from bad to worse. The few men have been paid off and the chance of mining at Burra is more unlikely than any time since the old mine whistle ceased to blow.

Mt Bryan now possesses one church (Methodist), a public house, a public school (moving from one place to another), a Council Chamber, and an Institute in the planning stage.

The Education Dept. has given one month’s notice of their intention to resume possession of the State schoolroom. The District Clerk will make arrangements for the removal of his office and furniture to give possession on 21 February.

Burra Mine. Burra Burra Copper Co. It is certain that mining is practically dead as far as Burra is concerned. With new American mines coming into existence and some millions of pounds spent in their development, there is no chance that copper prices will rise to the heights of a few months ago.

The young men who were engaged at the boring operations have behaved in an exemplary manner: ‘their lives and conduct can well be emulated by young men even in our town.’ They were required to maintain a very quiet attitude in respect to the progress of the bores and what was being discovered and not once did they betray the confidence reposed in them.

Redruth Court

Luke Day v. Charles Streicher to recover £6 in lieu of one month’s notice and damages of £15 for leaving without giving notice. Streicher had a counter-claim for £4-19-0 for unlawful detention of a passbook and £2-16-11 in due wages.

Defendant had been employed for c. 10 years with Day and he just stopped coming to work one Thursday. His mother told Day he had bought a business. Defendant had been ill and on return to work pay had been reduced to 25/- from 30/-, as he could not do all he had previously. This was by mutual agreement. Bert Knevitt, aged ‘over 30’ had taken his place and was cross-examined re his work with Day.

J.A. Knevitt: went to work for Day on 21 Dec. 1907. Was getting 27/6 a week.

Foster, for the defendant, said that Streicher was a weekly servant and the notice he gave was proper.

Streicher said he went to work at Day’s when he was 16, about 10 years ago and then had got 4/- a week plus board and lodgings. He said he gave notice on 26 February – giving a week’s notice. He gave notice on a Wednesday and left on a Wednesday. Said Day had not treated him as well as he ought to have. Was asked: when your mother came to Burra about four years ago did not Mr Day give her a house rent free for 12 months? Streicher was reluctantly forced to agree.

Frank Streicher also gave evidence.

The SM gave a verdict of £2-10-0 to Day in lieu of two weeks’ notice and £3 damages less £2-16-11 due in wages for a total to Day of £2-13-1. Costs against defendant.

Burra School Sports are arranged for Empire Day, 25 May.

Court, 11 May.

On 3/5 at Millerton Mrs Caroline Jones ‘distributed an unlimited amount of billingsgate’ on Mrs Wahlert’s daughter. A little later she appeared and ‘essayed the task of telling the latter [Mrs Wahlert] the pedigree of Hetty Wahlert’ and she then told Mrs Gentle ‘something she did not know before, and couldn’t understand when she was told’. Evidence was taken from Amelia Walker and Mrs Lepley. Mrs Jones then gave evidence that it was all lies and actually Henrietta Wahlert had ‘sulphured the surrounding atmosphere’, but her version lost some credibility when Hetty Wahlert interjected: ‘You’re a liar Mrs Jones.’

‘Yes I am, just like you!’ said Mrs Jones.

David Rees Jones said he had heard the quarrel, but there ‘was nothing out of the way mentioned’.

Mrs Jones was fined £1-17-0.

The Labor Party Social & Dance to aid Mrs Davies was held on the very cold and wet Thursday evening last week. Attendance was thus not as great as hoped for, but a number of tickets had been pre-sold, so financially it went better than it appeared.

A Quadrille Class will begin at the Burra Institute on Friday week and then run fortnightly through winter. A season’s ticket is 7/6.

The Telephone. There is general dissatisfaction with the Postmaster-General’s reply to the request for a telephone link to Adelaide. There is no reason why Burra should be dependant upon Petersburg in this matter.

The Aberdeen Ballast Quarry was sold on Wednesday to H. Collins of Mt Bryan, but he immediately resold it to someone else who, finding that the Government did not intend to work it, in turn sold it to Mr Elisha Ford.

The Government has decided to cease operations at the quarry and on Saturday 22 men and boys were thrown out of employment. Over the past two years it has had a good run, employing up to 36 men at times. The bidding on Wednesday was apparently higher than the Government was prepared to go. At present it is cheaper to bring ballast from the Mitcham Quarry. Aberdeen would need to put in crushers to make it pay. The Government has a lease for four years, but at present will not work it except for occasional small quantities.

Snow fell heavily on Monday morning and remained in some places all day.

Rain is urgently needed in the eastern country.

The Eastern Telephone Syndicate.

The eastern country at present gets one mail a week, and even so many have to travel several miles to collect it. A meeting on 17 July at Frank Treloar’s office in Commercial St will consider the establishment of a telephone line out to the eastern plains. There is no doubt it would be a paying venture and no doubt therefore the Government will give a helping hand.

Ross’s Pictures will be shown at the Institute tomorrow evening. They claim ‘the only absolute flickerless machine in Australia’.

Snow. It was bitterly cold on Sunday with a heavy fall of snow on Monday morning. Small fry indulged in snowballing and so did old fry. Snowmen were manufactured. One misdirected snowball broke a window of Stan Lane’s shop in Market Square. Many horse baulked completely at the white surface. By about 9 a.m. the thaw was general, though some remains on the hills in places yet. About 2 p.m. a very heavy fall occurred, but by then the ground was too warm to retain it.

The Ivy Dance & Social at the Institute on Friday was peculiarly successful with almost all the invitations sent out being accepted.

Burra Rifle Club. The finals of the Squatter’s Aggregate saw J.A. Riggs win by one shot from L.G. Stephens with R.D. Pascoe five points behind the leader.

The late J. Ford’s sale is reported in some detail, though the lack of section or allotment numbers makes it hard to pin point the blocks sold. The polo paddock went for £9-17-6 an acre for 79 acres. The 21⁄2 acres of the Bon Accord Mine went to the SA Government for £255. Truscott & Harris’s shop, office and butchers premises drew £560. Mrs Rogers bought the Black Waterholes garden of 25 acres for £13 per acre.

Snow fell between Burra & Hallett last Monday and remained on the caps of the ranges for several days and in places is still there. It was the heaviest fall on record at Mt Bryan.

Mt Bryan residents are divided on the need for a hall. A further meeting will be held after the new Council settles in. The proposal is for a hall 44’ x 33’ with a 16’ x 7’ platform and a reading room and Council chamber 151⁄2’ x 15’.

Weather. Burra has been exceedingly cold in the last week. Tuesday had a severe frost, which remained all day in sheltered places. Water in pipes froze and water in the creeks froze enough for children to run on the ice.

St Mary’s Diamond Jubilee will see W.J. Davey, of the Record office, produce a souvenir of photographs of the interior and exterior, the organ, the past clergymen, trustees, lay readers, wardens, sides-men, choristers, Sunday school children, groups at the celebrations, bishops, and other views. The photographs will be worked up in the finest coloured inks. Souvenir to measure 9” x 7”.

Celebrations will commence on Sunday next with Holy Communion at 8 a.m., Matins at 11 a.m. and Choral Evensong at 7 p.m. Rev. W.G.M. Murphy, of All Souls’ St Peters, will preach.

The Quadrille Committee has sold then 100 season tickets they had printed and have ordered 50 more at 7/6 for the season.

Mt Pleasant Estate was sold at Mt Bryan on Wednesday and realised very high prices. They went to £8-1-0 per acre in one case, which is well beyond the real value of the land. There were 11 lots for which details are given. Cheapest was lot 10 of 370 acres to T.E. Richards for £3-19-0 per acre. Most of the others went for between £5-5-0 and £5-15-0 per acre.

The Kingston Hotel and a lot of 1,543 acres of grazing land were passed in.

Mt Bryan Hall meeting recently favoured building a hall and the latest meeting was to resolve the financing of it. Chairman H.S. Stephens favoured a special rate of 11⁄2d for 22 years (or a lesser rate if for 40 years.) Eventually it was decided to borrow the money from the State Bank for a term of years. A special rate will have to be struck to guarantee the repayment

[The editor replies that Mr Day is misinformed. Rev. Winter thought that all hawkers should be abolished, including Assyrians and Chinese.]

The Eastern Telephone Syndicate.

The meeting on Friday in F. Treloar’s office to discuss a proposed eastern telephone line was well attended. W.P. Barker presided. He believes promoters would receive very little encouragement from the Government and that they therefore had to consider constructing it privately. Those present were:

W.P. Barker (Baldina) J. Gallagher (Pualco & Quondong)

L.W. Gebhardt (Mokoto) C.B. Warnes (Woolgangi)

T. McWaters (World’s End) J.A. Riggs (Murkaby)

J. Reed (Mongolata) J. Tennant (Oakbank)

J. Bowman (Manunda) H.S. Stephens (Mongolata)

T. McBride (Redcliffe)

F. Treloar, as acting secretary, had collected much information. The Government response so far is that even if they wanted to help there was no money, but some might be placed on next year’s estimates. It was thought that a privately erected line would be best so that no time was lost. The proposal is for a trunk line to Quondong, 95 miles from Burra. Costs were established and then attention turned to the method of erection. A decision to go ahead was made with only one dissention. The proposal is for iron posts for the first mile and then timber, with the posts carted from the east. One gentleman said he could provide them for £1 a mile. Private erection is estimated at half the Government cost of £30 per mile. The Postmaster-General reserved the right to erect all such lines within any railway reserve, municipality, township or public road. On private land the method of construction is at the discretion of the persons constructing. With approval of the landowner. A licence to operate is needed from the Deputy Postmaster-General when he is satisfied. Another meeting was scheduled for 7 August.

He wondered why sweatshop workers didn’t go into domestic service where they would be paid more and get better status. [The report reveals very little about what he may have had to say about Aborigines.]

Mt Bryan has had an influx of new settlers and only one or two pioneer residents have survived to see it. Fruit and flower gardens are holding their own and vegetable gardens are extensive. On older properties the older inadequate houses have been replaced by nice dwellings, but most new settlers are making shift with primitive homesteads. Today there are about 60 farms in the district. They are practical farmers getting the most from their land. Mt Bryan’s jollifications in clued ‘at homes’, surprise parties etc. Tennis is much practised and football will become more prominent. Several town allotments have been sold. Closer settlement is just the thing for the Mt Bryan District.

Light refreshments preceded the dash to the home of the bride’s father.

Mr Robert Fuss writes complaining that in three cases prizes were awarded at the Burra Show when the pots containing plants exceeded the 7” diameter allowed. The secretary disallowed a written protest. Even more concerning, he says, was the taking of a plant of his from a collection of six to make a third in another person’s exhibit in the three-plant section. And ‘to finish up this bungling I was awarded a prize for six plants with only five showing.’

‘Shareholder’ writes agreeing with a suggestion in The Advertiser that when Labor MPs visit Burra they should inspect the mine and report on the way things have been done since the company [Burra Burra Copper Co.] was floated. He thought a Parliamentary Commission would be a good thing.

## VX, 820, 23 Sep. 1908, page 3

The Burra Show was held at Victoria Park on Wednesday in moderately fair weather. Though the threat of rain may have kept some people away, there was still a record attendance. John McLaren as secretary is to be congratulated. Horse numbers were down, but the quality was up. A later show would help horse entries. (But if by more than a fortnight it would harm sheep entries, as seed would appear in the wool.) Agricultural and dairy produce were both good. Fowl entries were high with over 300 this year.

‘Mr A. Forrest scored well with his three-year-old filly, plough and dray horses and a team of six, and approprirted [sic] Mr Thos. Sandland’s splendid prize of £5 for the latter.’

Cattle were poorly represented and there were only a few dogs.

Sheep and wool were well represented and pride of place went to Thomas Sandland of Koo-owie and W.T. Mortlock of Martindale. Also doing well were A. Gebhardt & John Collins and for small flock owners, Mr F.G. Dawson.

In vegetables Chin Young predominated and in flowers R. & A. Fuss did well.

No trace of the missing woman has been found despite search parties.

A near drowning. Two little girls named McGowan fell into the Burra Creek on Friday from a footbridge, when a couple of foolish boys shook the planks. Mr Rundle, the postmaster, saved the life of one by wading in after her. He was assisted by Mr John Harry. The older sister fell near the edge and was assisted out by Miss Pearce who was close at hand. Mr Seabury got a trap and drove the girls home to Hampton.

The Tilly Kubel Case. [Further details occupy 11⁄2 columns.]

Matilda J. Kubel (Tilly) went missing on Wednesday. Pearl Montgomery, the nurse girl, found her missing at 6.30 a.m. Two letters in her room instructed Mrs Sangster what to do with Tilly’s machine and money. The bed had been slept in. Searches were instigated. Mrs Sangster and the Doctor are at a loss to explain why Miss Kubel disappeared so quickly. Tilly had not complained of being despondent and had been an excellent servant. There was a belief she had thrown herself into the Mine Pool, but it has been dragged and it is now thought she may have thrown herself down a shaft. The Doctor doesn’t believe this, as she had access to poisons in his dispensing room had suicide been her intention. Dynamite in the Mine Pool on Monday failed to lead to any discovery. Her sister at Farrell’s Flat (Mrs Przibilla) was notified. A reward for information has been posted.

Obituary: The Tilly Kubel Case.

The body of Miss Kubel was found by three small boys. It was floating in a pool by the old ford just south of Roach’s Mill. They told the news to Mr W.J. Richards and M-C Farrell retrieved the body. A crowd soon gathered to see the ambulance pass and Dr Sangster jun. identified Miss Kubel at the morgue. It is surprising that she was not discovered earlier in such a frequented place.

[Details occupy a 11⁄3 column report, but add little of substance.] Mr McGilchrist JP decided no inquest was necessary. [Born Johanna Mathilda Kubel 25 February 1884 at Bundey: died Johanna Matilde Kubel 14 October 1908 at Burra, residence Kooringa.]

Some 32 years ago he took up land at World’s End. He was born at St Tossell’s in Cornwall. [In paper of 25 November called St Ostle; in fact St Austell.] He came to SA with his wife and one son (William Henry). He leaves a wife, three daughters and three sons: Mrs Bruse (World’s End), Mrs Fisher (Bower), Miss Prior (at home), William Henry (World’s End), John (Murray Bridge), James (at home) and 39 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.

Marriage. Last Monday Martin Pederson, eldest son of Mr M. Pederson of Kooringa, married Olive Wise, daughter of Cr & Mrs John Wise.

J. McLaren writes re the removal of the footbridge across the creek opposite the Kooringa Post Office. The reason given was that two boys had fallen from it. On this basis the bridge near Henderson’s will also no doubt have to go. A handrail would have been a more reasonable response. Now people are forced to go to the bridge near the Burra Hotel with its more dangerous approach.

Children will now cross at the more dangerous slag crossing. The bridge removed is also the busiest one when events are at Victoria Park. South of the post office there are four bridges, but north of it none until the Aberdeen [Redruth] Bridge.

Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting, at the Institute last Wednesday.

C.A. Fuss presided. Attendance was fair.

The mayor, W. West said that the year opened with a credit of £7-15-10 and ends in credit £67-17-9, but another pay sheet is yet to come for the year which will virtually use up all the funds.

The expenditure included two new acetylene lamps, to bring the town’s total to 10 and the Council bought a block of land in Kooringa. [The depot in Thames St.]

Sanitary condition of the town is good with the exception of the Hospital septic tank, which has given much trouble and has been offensive for much of the time. Considerable changes will have to be made to rectify the problem.

While thanks go to the whole Council the work of the Town clerk, Mr A. Bartholomaeus, is especially notable and he has made a great effort to collect the rates.

## Concluded on page 4

Dr Sangster, candidate for Mayor, thought a rate increase was desirable. Scavenging is costing more and so is lighting and yet better lighting is needed. More trees are still needed. Market Square needed improving and Victoria Park had had money spent on it to little avail. He wondered why land had been bought in Kooringa. It could hardly be for a Council building as the arrangement with the Institute could not be bettered for 7.9 a week.

Cr Walker could not endorse the remarks of the Doctor with respect to market Square because he could not see his way clear of supporting anything done in Kooringa.

The present site of the oval was ridiculous and needed quite £200 to level it.

Cr Ockenden was more concerned with sanitation than with beautifying the town. There were places where water closets were shared and these problems came before beautification. The problem at the Hospital needed to be fixed. He favoured a public abattoir, so that meat might be inspected before being consumed in the town. At present only O’Leary Bros had their meat inspected and he recommended one and all to buy their meat there. He believed £40 would make a big improvement to the oval. He was not keen on seeing an oval developed at the northern end and he believed if the show went there businesses in Kooringa would suffer. The mayor’s allowance should be abolished. Rates should not be increased.

Cr Wise was also against any increase in rates. The land bought was merely for a depot for Council tools. The old Baptist Church met that need. A pound at the back of the property would be useful. He was not satisfied about the small rent reduction the Council had won from the Institute committee.

Mr Winnall did not agree with Cr Walker that all the work should be done in North Ward: an entirely too narrow view. He was for improvements in Market Square with a band rotunda. A pound in Kooringa would do away with what the Record calls facetiously the Inspector’s levee. More streetlights were desirable, but cost money.

E.W. Crewes favoured improvements with fencing and plantings in Market Square and was in favour of increasing rates to achieve good outcomes. He thought they needed a new post office and that footpaths needed attention and tar-dressing extended on them. He thought the Mayor’s allowance should be increased.

SAR has erected bells at Shannon’s Crossing a few miles south of Burra, but ring only for some trains. This is lunacy and the bells must ring for all trains or be removed.

Holidays. Little has been arranged in Burra for the holiday period.

Burra School resumes on 18 January.

Ice Works production began last Saturday.

Fire. On Wednesday about 1 p.m. a fire started on Stuart [Steward] McWater’s farm and burnt considerable stubble. Men cutting thistles on Booborowie Station came to the rescue, followed by neighbours, who controlled the blaze. Mr McWaters thanks all those concerned.

The Record will not be issued on 30 December, but will reappear on 6 January 1909.

Fire. On 16 December a large grass fire occurred on Canowie and wind carried the flames towards the homestead. By noon 300 men were engaged. The fire brigade’s pumps were blocked by debris from the impure water supply. After it had travelled some 4 miles a wind shift enabled men to drive it towards the three-chain road and save the homestead. A whirlwind spread it to another paddock though, and it got away again with a gale behind it. It was heading to a small wheat crop of C. Collins, but determined action saved it. A second lot of back burning finally succeeded in holding this outbreak by 7 p.m. The cause of the outbreak is unknown, but possible a spark from a farmhouse fire near its origin.

Rechabites. The female Lily of the Valley Tent reports on 3 December that it had 154 members with a profit for the year of £50. Benefits are 10/- per week for subscription of 7d (rising with age).

Kooringa Methodist Church held its annual Hospital Service on Sunday. Sir Frederick Holder preached three times that day.

Burra School break-up and prize giving was on Thursday. There are 150 boys and 121 girls on the roll for a total of 271. The prize list is printed.

St Joseph’s Convent School also has its prize list printed.

Tennis. Saturday: Aberdeen Juniors 55 games defeated Burra School 39 games.

Characteristics of the 1908 paper.

Page 1.

Large advertisements both local and other.

Page 2.

Smaller advertisements, sales notices, public notices.

Editorials are rare.

News items are annoyingly mixed with paragraphs of advertising matter, posing visually as news.

Page 3.

The news and advertising mixture continues. The ‘Short & Sharp’ column is not as cryptic as its earlier forerunners, but is sometimes annoyingly brief. News items are not generally followed up and there seemed little attempt at journalism. Sport is badly reported. Football for example is mentioned inconsistently and when it is mentioned the scores are generally omitted. Clearly if the club did not send in results the paper didn’t follow up. This page also carries reports from Broken Hill and other country centres in the district and state. Such evidence as the editor lets slip from time to time suggests a politically conservative view. For example he never analyses why men might be going on strike, but is always against such action. Holder had earlier outline reasons for such behaviour, even if he was against the action.

All in all the local news is fairly well covered, but some things slip through and there is little that is controversial and little evidence of a firm editorial hand.

Numbering of issues in 1908

Volume VX continued for the whole year, having started 12 July 1905.

The year began with Volume VX Number 804 on 8 January 1908

And continued to Volume VX Number 833 on December 1908

Within this series numbering was chaotic, running as follows:

804 to 809

Then numbers 800 to 809 were repeated.

Then 810 to 816

Then number 817 was used twice

Then 818 & 819

Followed by a repeat of numbers 810 to 819, within which 817 was used twice, making three times for it an all.

Then 820 to 833.

Obituary. John Michell [sic] Hunt died 24 December at his residence in Kooringa aged 83.

[John Mitchel Hunt died aged 82. See more on page 3 of this issue.]

Kooringa Methodist Sunday School held its annual picnic on New Year’s Day at Sod Hut in a paddock lent by J.C. Sandland. Any amount of refreshments was available and a large program of sports was carried out. Mrs A. Boulton was struck in the side of the face by a cricket ball and had to rest for the remainder of the day.

World’s End Sports on 1 January were a great attraction for people from Booborowie, Robertstown, Eudunda, Waterloo, Baldina, Burra & elsewhere. Horse events were well contested and the whole day went well and improved upon last year.

Christmas Holidays. On Christmas Eve Burra’s streets were thronged with people and very good order prevailed. There were clear signs of prosperity in the district. Storekeepers reported excellent business. People from both the town and district were much better dressed than usual and seemed more refined. The holidays passed quietly and pleasantly with many picnics arranged. Several churches held special Christmas Day services.

Weather. Last Saturday was the most disagreeable day for a long time. The shade temperature varied from 107°F to 112°F. The wind began in the morning and as time wore on it raised dust and the heat was almost unbearable. Towards evening the wind eased and was replaced by a muggy atmosphere with some thunder and lightning, but there were only a few drops of rain.

Sunday was sultry and oppressive with some thunder later and two or three heavy showers.

Black Springs Sports were successfully held on 25 December and about £10 was taken at the gate. Results are printed.

Mt Bryan held its usual Sunday school tea on 25 December. Takings amounted to over £9.

Fire. Several fires have occurred in the past week in the Mt Bryan area, but only one did much damage. That was in the paddock of Messrs Collins & Co. and burnt a quantity of grass.

W.T. Bell caught his hand in the pinion wheel of a reaper on Christmas Day and after treatment at the Burra Hospital is getting on as well as can be expected.

Hanson Tea Meeting. 229 came from Burra by train on Christmas Day besides numerous people by other conveyances. It is estimated that over 400 sat down to the tea which was connected with the Methodist Church Anniversary. There were so many to dine that the public meeting could not be held before the express came to return Burra visitors to their homes. Supper completed the day’s proceedings and the anniversary including Sunday’s collections raised £18-12-6.

Mrs I.J. Warnes gave a grand Christmas tree at her Leighton home and invited all the Leighton School children. The festival was quite unexpected till just before it was held. Some of the children had never seen a Christmas tree before. Toys were given to each child and there was a sumptuous spread. Mr Warnes showed people around the place, including the recent bore which provided an object lesson on the use of water for irrigation.

World’s End Sports are reported at greater length. P. Fuss of Burra won the Sheffield. Results are printed and details occupy c. 13⁄4 columns.

A Redruth Sunday School Concert was held in Jubilee Hall last Thursday to raise money towards funding a change to a more modern system of working. Despite the heat the hall was filled. The concert is reviewed in 1⁄4 column.

Burra Town Council, Monday night

Sir Frederick Holder wrote about the idea of a new post office for Kooringa. He was not encouraged to hope for a new building that would be a credit to the town. He thought it might be just as well to seek a complete renovation rather than an entirely new building.

The rates were set at General 11d, Health 5d and Park Lands 1d.

The Waterworks will be asked to provide water to the public at Aberdeen free of charge.

A petition for a new post office at Kooringa will be drawn up and someone will be employed to get it signed throughout the town.

Cricket. At Hallett on 1 January: Ketchowla 158 defeated Hallett 71.

Last Saturday at the Lucernedale pitch: Ketchowla 6 for 239 v. Burra 5 for 53.

Burra Brass Band. A meeting is called on 22 January to form a town band. If Terowie and Hamley Bridge can boast bands surely Burra can.

Annual Terowie Sports were held on 1 January. The gate of £21-13-0, concert of £21 and ball of £7 resulted in a profit of £16. C. McLaren of Burra won the Sheffield.

Morgan Sports on 1 January saw Johnson of Burra win the Sheffield Handicap and Frank Shortridge was second in the hurdles.

Obituary. The late John Mitchell Hunt died at his residence in The Paddock Kooringa on Thursday evening 24 December aged 83. He arrived in SA from England with his wife about 47 years ago and came to Burra where he worked as a Bootmaker and after some time went to Adelaide as manager for Mr Peacock in the skin trade. He later returned to Burra. He enjoyed good health though weakened by old age. He had a good memory, but his eyesight was failing. On Sunday 20 December he suffered an apoplectic stroke from which he did not recover. He leaves one daughter and three sons: Mrs Walker (Uarana NSW), A.J. & E.R. Hunt (Burra) and Fred. (Broken Hill). Mrs Hunt died about three years ago.

Leighton Hall. A meeting held at Leighton on Saturday night received plans and specifications for a new assembly hall and it was decided to call tenders. So far they have received every encouragement and between £80 & £90 has been promised and with concerts and the like it is expected the amount required will be raised. The building will measure 40 x 20ft internally.

Cricket. At Farrell’s Flat last Saturday Burra 9 for 289 & Farrell’s Flat 4 for 115.

Demolition of the Bible Christian Church.

For some time the church has been decaying. The first part to go was the ceiling, but after the union of the churches wind moved some of the slates and allowed water to penetrate the walls. It had been hoped the building might fall of its own accord. The western end of one of the principals decayed and last Thursday night it left its bearing and the western wall bowed out about two feet at the top, but did not fall. In the interests of public safety the building had either to be demolished or made safe. The uncertain state of the wall made demolition uncertain and eventually it was decided to use dynamite. Many of the community found this news distressing. Some wished to end the church’s life by singing a hymn or two and saying a prayer in the building, but the clear movement of the walls made this too dangerous. Between 9 7 10 o’clock on Saturday holes were drilled halfway up the walls and plugs of dynamite inserted. A large crowd watched as the first explosion in the damaged section had little effect; neither did the second in the western corner. Three more charges had been inserted when the western wall gave way, bringing down the roof with its estimated 60 tons of slate along with the massive rafters and principals. The building was erected some 48 years ago at a cost of about £2,200. The cable between the two gables snapped leaving the front one untouched and the northern gable out of plump [sic] about six or nine inches.

The crash of the roof and thud of the wall was heard for a considerable distance and the dust that rose obscured the whole of the building and sent observers back to escape being smothered. The Record photographer emerged from the dust cloud covered in it, but having secured the desired photographs. One who had experience of using dynamite in Broken Hill said the old building was stronger than ever he had anticipated. They then resorted to taking down the wall by manual strength, but only a little headway was made due to the quantity of the stuff to be moved. The side walls are 18” wide and the gable ends 2’. The roof and associated woodwork is estimated at over 80 tons.

Present were Mr John Sampson, the oldest adherent in the town, Mr Richard Thomas and William Harris. On Methodist Union the gallery and floor were removed and sold and many seats scattered round are testimony to the sale. Sam Hill and William Harris, who were selected for the demolition, had scrambled over the scaffolding when it was built. The church replaced the small building near Henderson’s Bridge now known as the schoolroom. The enlargement was needed when Rev. Way brought about a revival and nearly 300 members joined the church. It had in its time a fine choir. The first minister was Rev. Samuel Way [sic: corrected next issue to James Way] then Revs. Hillman & Rowe. Cornish miners gave all the necessary labour carting the stone, timber, iron etc. free of charge during the building of the church. When many people went to the Yorke Peninsula mines there was plenty of room in the church, but the remaining adherents never lost interest in it. Now it is roofless and floorless with the windows destroyed and the two huge gable ends still standing.

The [original] contractors were Messrs Burgoyne (the present MP) & Baker, both of whom lived at Port Augusta at the time. All the trustees are now dead except for Mr William Davey who is the original trustee and who helped did the foundation for the building, and Mr John Snell who was elected later and acted as Sunday school superintendent for many years.

W.J. Davey of the Record Studio was on the scene by special appointment and took several pictures. Numbers 1 & 2 show workmen drilling holes for the dynamite.

Number 3 shows the smoke of the explosion with no effective result.

Number 4 shows the wall in the act of falling which can be traced in various movements from the building to the ground. The apparatus fixed to the camera for this purpose was the work of and design of the operator. These pictures are for sale at the Record.

Aberdeen Ballast Quarry. Work resumed with 18 men after the Christmas holidays.

Fire. A large fire destroyed many acres of wheat crop and bagged grain at Farrell’s Flat last week.

Marriage. At Springbank on 12 January, Miss Brown married Mr A. Hancock.

Advt. Mt Bryan Sports will be held 3 March.

Bible Christian Church Demolition continued this week, but slow progress was made. The bulging part of the wall was made safe with the aid of a crab-winch and the northern gable held together as it rotated and fell to the ground in a piece, where it crumbled. The slates weighed c. 6 lb 10 oz each and had they been replaced by iron the building would no doubt have stood without the walls decaying. The sale of the pictures of the demolition has been phenomenal.

Burra Band Meeting.

The Mayor (Dr Sangster jun.) said it was almost a disgrace to have to call in a band from elsewhere for the recent church parade and for the annual show. He proposed a provisional committee be formed to get out subscription lists and collect money through the town and district. He hoped to occupy some of the youth of the town currently ‘gracing the kerbing around the streets’. They could start with a band of 12 performers, which would cost c. £177. 16 would run to c. £247, or 20 to c. £350. He hoped the larger sum could be raised over three years. Mr Middleton spoke in support and moved the meeting deemed the formation of a band desirable. C.A. Lott 2nd. Carried and a committee elected.

Obituary. James Tiver died at Aberdeen on Friday, aged 80. He arrived in SA in April 1855 from Bristol in the David Malcolm and came to Burra as contractor to the Smelting Works. He erected the first buildings in the town of any note as well as bridges and the making of roads. He constructed the black bridge over the creek in Aberdeen.* He took over the Aberdeen Railway Stores and ran them for over 40 years. He also bought land between Hallett and Yarcowie and secured Tiverton and Banbury. He was an earnest Christian who occupied many of the offices of the Redruth Methodist Church and was for over 50 years the Superintendent of the Sunday school, relinquishing it two years ago. He represented the Redruth Circuit at Conferences. He was also a JP, a Member of Loyal Aberdeen Lodge of Oddfellows. A cortege of 70-80 vehicles followed the coffin to the cemetery in one of the longest funeral seen in Burra for some time.

He reached Burra in a bullock dray and once went to Wallaroo to erect a mine building when water cost £1 for 33 gallons. Mrs Tiver was an invaluable helpmate. Once on going to join her husband at Wallaroo they had to erect a cottage for her and the children in one day. He leaves five daughters: Mrs Gray (Glenelg), Mrs E.F. Opie & Mrs A. Sara (Broken Hill), Mrs J.G. Sara (Aberdeen Railway Stores) & Mrs Stock (Campbelltown) and 43 grandchildren & 8 great-grandchildren.

Kooringa News, 26 June

Monday was a public holiday as mid-summer’s day (or rather mid-winter’s day). There was a dinner commemorating the anniversary of the Miners & Tradesmen’s Club. The Masonic Lodge also held a dinner and the following day saw the opening of the new Redruth Bridge. The work for this was commenced on 25 January and work proceeded steadily except on one occasion when workmen had to wait for the delivery of material. It is constructed on the laminated arch principle and has a span of 68 ft 6 inches, being built askew so that the span on the square is 60 ft. The abutments and wing walls are of coarse hammer-dressed rubble masonry. From these spring four laminated arches or ribs, bearing a framed wooden superstructure, surmounted by the roadway, which is formed of two transverse thicknesses of three-inch gum planking laid diagonally. The side rails are of white painted deal. The whole reflects great credit on the builders; Messrs Burgoyne & Baker for the carpentry and Messrs Tiver and Cole for the masonry.

For the Redruth Bridge standing in 1909 the contract went to Duncan Grant and he is mentioned in the paper throughout the construction of the bridge in 1879 and at its opening. See Burra Record II. 77. 19 December 1879, page 2. This bridge survived into the 21st century, though only as a footbridge after the Morgan Road by-pass was constructed in the 1980s.]

Redruth Court, Monday

Frederick Neydock was charged with behaving indecently before Alice Bevan a girl under the age of 14 on 14 March.

The girl said the defendant was about 20 yards from his own house and while looking at her he behaved indecently. She told her father who sent her out again saying he would follow and observe. The action was repeated. [Though on cross examination she said she didn’t look the second time and the repetition was observed by her father.]

Mr Winnall for the defence thought that this was extraordinary behaviour for the father. He also tried to suggest that it was extremely unlikely that someone would behave in such a manner while she was with her father, but the girl insisted that he had. He was at the time some 50 or 60 yards away.

Alfred Bevan said he was the father of Alice and recalled his daughter telling him what ‘Fred’ had done and he had sent her out again and followed her. He saw what the defendant was doing and sang out to him ‘that will not do, old man.’ The defendant then went inside.

M-C Clarke then told the court what had happened when he interviewed the defendant.

Mr Winnall said it was quite unreasonable to suggest a man possessing any grain of sense or self respect would carry on as the girl wished the court to believe. He suggested there was some animosity between the parties and this was how the plaintiff aimed to get even with the defendant. For this to happen in broad daylight among houses inhabited by people was beyond all probability. The evidence was conflicting and unreliable.

Fred. Neydock was called and said he was not guilty. He said he was outside looking for Bill Highet because they always went for a walk on Sundays. He said his brother Paul was only about half a yard away and his sister Mary was also nearby. As he was going inside he had heard Bevan call out, but had not seen him.

Paul Neydock confirmed this and said Fred didn’t do bad things.

Mrs Mary Mann, sister of the defendant gave similar evidence.

Mr Winnall said it was a case of trumpery altogether.

The court decided the evidence warranted conviction and though the highest penalty was £10, they would fine the defendant £1 + £1 court fees or in default 14 days. The fine was paid.

Obituary/Memorial Service for the late Jesse Humphrys: conducted on Sunday 11 April at the Wesley Bicentenary Church, Hanson by Rev. W.F. James.

Jesse Humphrys was born at Hassage, Somerset on 2 January 1835 to a large working class family. He married Miss Flower, sister of Joseph Flower of Stony Gap and reached SA with his wife’s parents in 1854. He worked for a few years for Joseph Turner at the Reed Beds and then for a few years on land he took up at Port Gawler. He then moved to Stony Gap where he served as a Councillor and Chairman of the Apoinga DC and helped to build a hall for temperance and other meetings and also for church services and day and Sunday schools. While at Stony Gap his wife and mother of ten children died and sixteen months later he married Mrs Turner of Black Springs who died in November 1902. He let his farm to the Hon. W. Duffield & Mr Makin for 21 years and bought a farm near Hanson from Thomas Glasson and remained there till his death.

He was converted in 1862 under the ministry of Rev. T. Lloyd at ‘The Gums’ and the next Sunday walked 10 miles to Kooringa to hear Mr Lloyd preach. For many years he was the leading man in the Hanson Home Mission of the Redruth Circuit. For 25 years he and others worshipped in the Council Chamber where his eight sons and daughters were converted. He was class leader and superintendent of the Sunday school at Hanson. In 1899 Mr Humphrys put £20 into a savings account to start a church building fund. A trust was formed and a 2-acre property was secured in Hanson, though little tangible activity took place for three years. Rev. H.J. Pope, President of Conference laid one of two memorial stones and Mr Humphrys the other and on Good Friday 1904 the church known as Wesley Bicentenary Church was opened. It had cost £315 and was free of debt. Mr Humphrys was regarded as the father of Hanson. He never fully recovered from a severe operation about four years ago and he died at Burra Hospital on 19 February 1909. He desired to see a grand revival and to get a Sunday school hall built at Hanson and he offered £40 towards the latter. Rev. James called for an account to be opened to build free of debt, the Jesse Humphrys Memorial Hall to stand alongside the Wesley Bicentenary Church and the meeting carried a resolution to effect that. One of Mr Humphrys’ sons has promised £50 towards the new hall.

Editorial on the New Oval.

It had been the fear of some that the object of the syndicate that purchased the Aberdeen Polo Grounds some time ago was against Kooringa and to abolish Victoria Park. Consequently their enterprise was condemned. In fact the object is not a moneymaking enterprise, but to give the town a site for show and sports purposes. The issue was thrashed out at a meeting at the Institute on Friday when Thomas Sandland, one of the Syndicate, which is now a trust, explained what the trust intended to do. The show committee has decided to move to the new ground and although the surroundings are not all that could be desired, a good foundation has been laid for future improvements.

Victoria Park has never served its purpose very well and it may now become even more of a white elephant. Having created an enclosure costing some £600 it would be thought it would be eternally useful, but in fact has proved unsuitable from the outset. It was soon seen that if much was spent on it to effect improvements, the returns would be inadequate. It is now too small for the needs of the show. Councillors do not believe money spent there is well invested; consequently four or five townsmen have acted in a practical way and bought the best possible piece of ground.

Burra Show Society Special Meeting re The New Oval.

There was great contention on the aim of the syndicate that bought the land from the estate of the late Joe Ford. But the meeting on Friday made it clear that they are not out to make money, but rather the town should be thankful for the provision of a fine sports and showground. There was a large attendance at the meeting and there was an almost unanimous vote of Show Society subscribers favouring the proposal to move the show to the new oval.

Mr E. Bowman presided and Mr Thomas Sandland moved the proposal 2nd by Mr Winnall.

Mr Sandland said the trust intended to erect a grandstand to seat 300 and if necessary it could be extended. A refreshment room would be included beneath it and a large shed for the display of produce. The trust would grant the society free use of the ground for five years if the society agreed to move the sheep pens, cattle yards and a small shed, from Victoria Park to the new ground. The cost was estimated at £27. Mr Sandland said after five years the rent would be £3-3-0, the same as at present. Subsequent improvements would be at the trust’s expense. One problem would be collecting admission fees at a site presently unfenced, but Mr Sandland said it didn’t seem a major problem for the races. Extensive tree planting was planned. Mr Sandland said the grounds would be ready for the next show.

The trust includes Hon. John Lewis MLC, L.W. & A.G. Gebhardt, Thomas Sandland, James Gallagher & W.P. Barker.

Football. The Aberdeen Football Club met at the Royal Exchange Hotel last week and decided that the juvenile club be not associated with the seniors.

Accident/Obituary. Death of Mr W. Hopkins.

Mr W. Hopkins left Mr Day’s store in Kooringa on Monday to do the usual grocery round at World’s End. At the gate of the late William Prior’s property his foot slipped while he was boarding the vehicle and became entangled in the chain attached to the pole.

Some suggestions include fencing it in a triangular form and erecting a rotunda there, with plantings of shrubs.

The Old Baptist Church. Having long been forsaken and falling into ruin, it was purchased some time ago by the Council for use as a depot for the sum of £60-£70.

Lott has almost completed re-roofing it. So far £30 has been saved by storing weights and measures there and if it were used as a Council Chamber the £20 p.a. rent of the Institute would be saved and the building would pay for itself in three years.

Obituary. Sir Frederick Holder died on 23 July in Melbourne.

Sir Frederick Holder, Speaker of the House of Representatives, had an apoplectic seizure after an all-night sitting discussing the Old Age Pension. He was greatly respected as Speaker for his fairness. He collapsed on the floor of the House at 6.30 a.m. and died without regaining consciousness at 4 p.m. He was born at Happy Valley in SA on 12 May 1850, the son of Morecott Holder. A promising student, he was induced to become a teacher and accepted a position under the Education Dept. He however, felt he would do better as a journalist and secured possession of the Burra Record of which he became editor. He wrote columns also for the Advertiser and to the English newspapers. While still editor of The Record he became Mayor of Burra. In 1887 he was elected to the SA House of Assembly at the head of the poll, along with W.B. Rounsevell with the latter edging out Sir John Cockburn by 5 votes. (Sir John then got elected for Mt Barker.)

On 27 June 1889 he became Treasurer of SA in the Cabinet of Sir John Cockburn.

He was renowned for thoroughness and helpfulness and was never factious in opposition. In policy he was consistent. Of the 22 years in SA and Federal Parliaments he was a Minister or Speaker for all but three of them. He represented the same constituents throughout. In the SA Parliament he represented Burra and was elected to Federal Parliament first on a State-wide basis and then re-elected for Wakefield, which included Burra. He was a strong supporter of Federal Union.

When the Commonwealth was formed he was Premier of SA. In SA he was mostly Treasurer, but for a while under the Kingston Government when he was Commissioner of Public Works. The state funeral took place in Adelaide on Monday and thousands attended despite torrential rain.

Editorial on Cemetery Finances.

Previously the curator had a commission on blocks sold and grave fees, but no fixed salary. He got about £1 a week – not enough to keep a man able to do heavy work. When Mr Thomas gave up the job an alternative was needed. The first applicants wanted £2-2-0 a week and suggested they work 3 out of six days on Corporation duties, but the dayman can do all that is required. There are not the finances to pay £2-2-0 a week, besides more land will soon be needed and there will then be the expense of enclosing it. We suggest appointing the dayman as curator and employing extra labour to dig graves and do other work when required.

The horse fled through Redruth, took the main road to Kooringa, went through Market Square, across Kingston St Bridge and through Paradise after which it took the stock road until stopped by a deep creek.

The necessary transformation has been made by Mr G. Bartholomaeus. Miss Natalie Sara is Post Mistress. The telephone from Kooringa has been enclosed for privacy and alphabetically arranged pigeonholes have made collecting mail much more efficient. Many have transferred their postal addresses from Kooringa as a result.

Ratepayers’ Meeting at the Institute on 24 November.

J.E.H. Winnall presided.

The Mayor’s Report occupies about 2 columns.

The mayor, Dr Sangster jun., expressed his regret at the death of Sir Frederick Holder during the year. Mr Bartholomaeus, Town Clerk, resigned through ill health in May. He had served 10 years without a holiday and he was presented with a silver salver in appreciation. His replacement, Mr Steele, was appointed to the combined position of Town Clerk and Inspector. Mr Thomas, curator of the cemetery, also resigned through ill health. Nobody applied to replace him under the old terms and the new conditions of £2-2-0 a week and 2/- per Sunday saw Mr W. Harris appointed from 5 applicants. This is a big increase in cost, but he will help the dayman, which will cut out the need for casual labour in ward works. The cost will be met £60 from the cemetery account, £46 from ward work and £8 from main roads. A new building on the site of the present Kooringa Post Office will begin to be built about March 1910 and it will provide for private boxes and a telephone exchange. Telephonic communication with Adelaide will be effected in 1910. The community benefited greatly in 1909 from the generosity of a small group of well-known men in the formation of the Aberdeen Oval and the transfer there of the Show.

Attendance at Council meetings has been excellent.

Major public works for the year:

Erection of the Corporation Depot and its fencing: £54-17-3.

The making of the George St Ford across the Burra Creek.

Lamp lighting cost £36-9-2.

In Health the septic tank at the Hospital has been the main concern and efforts now being made to combat the smell should be effective. The tank is now completely covered and the effluent will discharge into a deep pit, presently being sunk.

Otherwise the town has been healthy.

The incoming Council will have to extend the cemetery and enclosing this will dispose of the credit balance now standing at £74-8-2.

Councillors then spoke.

Cr Burns:

He had served the ward for 4 years and was retiring from that position. He had always voted for what he considered right and against what he considered wrong.

Cr Crewes:

He had not much to say now, but would later offer a personal explanation. He had only served half his term as a Councillor, but circumstances had led to his seeking the Mayoralty. Anyone looking over the minute book would see he was not the sleepy member for East Ward, but always wide awake.

Cr Lowe:

Believed he had striven to do his best over the past two years and must have given satisfaction or he would not have been pressed to stand again.

VX, 880, 1 Dec. 1909, Page 4

C.A. Fuss moved thanks to the retiring Councillors and then the candidates for the Mayoralty were invited to speak. This was the first election for Mayor for about 15 years.

[Actually the last election had been when John Sampson jun. defeated E.F. Lockyer on 1 December 1897.]

Cr Burns said he had received a requisition to stand from c. 70 ratepayers. Of Course they had not always seen eye to eye on Council in the year, but after healthy discussion had done what was considered right. He could not say what he intended to do if returned, but would attend to business promptly. He did not believe in Councillors interfering with work in wards they didn’t represent. He was the oldest or next oldest Burraite on the Council and would not lose sight of the work needed to make it even more picturesque. He was against Market Square being fenced as a paddock, but would not oppose anything tending to make it truly more beautiful.

Cr Crewes said the time had come for personal explanation why he was standing in mid-term. The Mayor had asked him a few meetings ago if he intended standing for Mayor and he has said no. As soon as it was known that the Doctor was not going to stand a movement was set on foot to requisition the speaker (Crewes) to stand and the first he had heard of it was the day after the Council. His opponents had said it was all a concoction of himself and Mr Hardy, which was a falsehood. He was getting into a cab when Mr Hardy called to him saying that they were getting up a requisition and asking him if he would stand. He said he needed time to think it over. He had then tried to get Cr Wise or Mr Winnall to stand, but had been unsuccessful. On receiving a large requisition to stand he had agreed, not knowing Cr Burns intended coming out. As soon as he resigned as Councillor his opponents made a spring with a requisition to Councillor Burns. While he was Mayor he had more work to do than any Mayor before or since as it was during the Boer War, when scores of meeting had to be presided over and he had also attended in Sydney during the Commonwealth Celebrations. He knew the workings of Council and of 247 motions in the minute book he had moved 117. He would bring as much zeal and energy to the position as to his own business. He would like to see the town better lit and trees better protected. The Jubilee Avenue should be better fenced. The new Post Office and telephone exchange was the result of persistent pegging.

Cr Burns asked to rise on a matter of personal explanation and when allowed said he had lived all his life in Burra and defied anyone to say anything against his reputation.

The Mayor – That is not a personal explanation.

Burns – I am accused of telling falsehoods.

Chair – Cr Crewes did not accuse you of falsehoods.

[Crewes had said he was surprised that Burns was standing as the latter had said he was heartily sick of Municipal work.]

Cr Wise, when asked, agreed that what Burns had actually said was that Wise would have to find another colleague in West Ward in the next twelve months – quite a different thing.

Burns then objected to Crewes’s saying he had sprung up as an opponent as soon as Crewes had resigned. The chair said that Crewes had not accused him, but had referred to ‘opponents’ as distinct from ‘his opponent’.

Burns and Crewes were also engaging in some inaudible, but apparently frank exchanges and eventually Cr Crewes got up and seated himself on the opposite side of the Chairman.

Mr Ockenden then moved Mr Burns be allowed to explain.

Cr Crewes demanded the same right.

There was general hubbub and eventually the chair called on Cr Lowe to speak as candidate for North Ward. He said he would do his best if elected.

Mr Hardy was then called to speak as East Ward candidate, but he wondered how his name was listed as he was not a candidate – yet.

S.M. Lane then spoke briefly followed by C.A. Lott and then Mr Ockenden, who spoke at great length about the desirability of mayors not serving longer than two years, but regretted that Dr Sangster had not continued for a second year. He spoke in favour of protecting Victoria Park. The Council should also own a quarry of its own – in 30 years it had paid some £900 in royalty. It had also paid some £1,000 for use of the Council Chamber and should have a room of its own, or else own the Institute. He then had to stop on account of a pain in his heart.

Mr Hardy then rose to say he had decided to stand and denied the suggestion that he and Mr Crewes had concocted the petition calling on the latter to stand. He favoured tree planting, Market Square improvements and improvements at Victoria Park and a new fence to Jubilee Avenue. And a fire hose for the town – a matter that had still not been brought to a head. Tar paving of footpaths was needed and more work done in the back parts of town. A public abattoirs was needed.

A. Harris briefly called on voters to ‘give him a vote on December 4 and never mind the other fellow’. [i.e. Hardy]

Declaration of the Poll.

[Page 2 says that c. 150 attended.]

Mr Burns thanked his supporters and moved a vote of thanks to Mr Wade as returning officer. Mr Hardy 2nd. ‘Billy’ Hardy said he was sure he would be returned.

A voice said – ‘You want Tom Rabbich with you now.’

‘Some very injudicious remarks have been made in reference to his candidature, but he was willing to forgive and forget.’

Mr Crewes supported the vote of thanks.

He could not help, but refer to the way his opponent was trotted out after he (Crewes) had sent in his resignation to Council, but he had now finished with Municipal matters and would never again allow himself to be nominated, but he would watch the work done in Council meetings from time to time. He was consoled by the men who stood on street corners who admitted he was the best man for the position.

Groans and cries of ‘Sit down’ and ‘Your talking rot’. [sic]

Crewes – ‘Will you get that man put outside Mr Chairman.’

A Voice – ‘Look here, Crewes, it would take a better man than you to put me out.’

The Chair said he was repeating what was said at the ratepayers’ meeting, which was inappropriate here.

But Crewes continued in the same theme for a while. He thanked the 152 ratepayers who voted for him and was glad to know ‘There were at least that number of sensible people in the town.’

S.M. Lane thanked ratepayers for returning him unopposed.

A. Harris thanked his supporters, as did C.A. Lott.

Kooringa Methodist Church. The Mission Fair and sale of goods arranged by the Girls’ Church Aid Club in support of Foreign Missions, held at the church on Friday was very successful.

Tennis. On Wednesday Kooringa 5-40 defeated Aberdeen 4-35.

Leighton Hall was opened on 24 November by Hon. J. Lewis MLC, before a large crowd. He had known the area for 47 years – from a time when there was but one fence as a dividing boundary. Mr Bailey and Mr Gillett were the first to take up land after the survey, but eventually as conditions changed other settlers came in. Of late closer settlement had seen the cutting up of the large estates and there were more farmers and more wheat, giving more revenue to the state. He saw old friends like Mrs McDonald – an early settler of Leighton. He had not realised how large the Hall was and he congratulated the committee and the contractors. The committee had collected about £140 and the balance had been met by local guarantors. The crowd was so large they could not all fit inside the hall. The usual series of votes of thanks followed. The site was the gift of the Education Department and vests in four trustees, while the building is 43’ x 23’. The hand-dressed stone at the front reflects well on the mason, Mr Giet. The ceiling is Wunderlich steel and a movable 16’ x 9’ stage is provided and a new piano with chairs and forms. The first concert was under the supervision of W.J.C. Ewins and a ball followed. Over £12 was raised.

Burra Rifle Club. The first match for the wind gauge saw C.C. Lord 105 ahead of J. Kellock 104.

Ladies Political Social. Burra Institute 26 November.

W.G. Hawkes presided and the speakers were Mr Hawker, Hon. T. Pascoe and Miss Farr.

[They were a conservative group who spoke in favour of the current role of the Legislative Council and against any reform of it, or its abolition, which was Labor Party policy. Apparently it was organised by the National Defence League.]

We understand that as a result of the meeting a large number of ladies as well as gentlemen joined the league.

Olive Dew was given a 21st birthday party on 2 December at ‘Blue Bell’.

Burra Rifle Club held a social at the Burra Hotel on Wednesday last and the trophies recently won, were presented. [The winners were as previously noted and the report runs to 11⁄2 columns.]

Dr Sangster jun. presided. He was concerned at the problem Burra had in maintaining any sporting club for long. Young men might get one going, but it soon fell to older ones to carry it on and married men had other obligations. The absence of a cricket club in the town was an example. In passing he mentioned the old rifle range as being ‘near the cemetery’. He especially thanked Captain Lord for the present healthy state of the Rifle Club. Presentations were then made and toasts proposed.

He visited his brother Michael’s grave where the WA Government has erected a marble headstone and iron railing. [For Michael’s death see VX, 778, 3 July 1907, page 3 with more details VX, 783, 7Aug. 1907, page 2.]

Joe Pascoe, father of R.D. Pascoe of Commercial St, has returned to live in Burra after some years in Broken Hill. He previously worked for many years at W. Henderson’s blacksmith’s shop.

A. McLachlan for 22 months ticket clerk at Burra Station has been moved to Bordertown as stationmaster.

‘Old Subscriber’ writes thanking the paper for its sensible reporting of municipal matters. The Record was clearly in possession of the circumstances and was able to pour oil on the troubled waters and presented the facts without undue criticism or sensationalism. [See the Ratepayers’ Meeting VX, 880, 1 Dec. 1909, Pages 3 & 4.]

R.J.J. Ockenden writes as a one-time shop assistant. He thanks businessmen for agreeing to close their shops from Saturday 25 December to Thursday 30 December and on Saturday 1 January. He then goes on to argue the case for a half-day holiday on Saturdays. The Wednesday half-day is a boon without question, but Saturday would be a much better choice. It is the usual day for recreation and enjoyment. He hopes that traders will fall into line and grant the boon now sought. The argument that Saturday night trading is necessary has had the bottom knocked out of it long ago and any inconvenience at its loss would be trifling. Only a few inconsiderate customers and a few greedy traders stand in the way of the change.

Miss Fuss of Aberdeen has been in Broken Hill for some time on holiday and proposes returning to Burra this week.

Obituary. John C. Sandland died early on Sunday morning last at Koonawarra three miles north of the Burra railway station. He had been feeling unwell from time to time lately, but did not think it serious. Just after recent shearing at Koonawarra he went to Nackara to supervise it there, but felt so ill he had to return to Burra sooner than intended. He thought he had a severe cold, but it grew worse and medical aid was sought. The doctor ordered complete rest and he had an internal complaint occasioning excruciating pain. The local doctors concluded that an operation was required, but doubted his strength to cope. Dr Poulton of Adelaide was summoned and an operation was performed which revealed there was no hope of recovery.

He was the son of the late John Sandland of Woodlands Lyndoch and was born in Shropshire England in 1845, arriving in SA with his parents when only 2. He always led a life of uprightness and straighforwardness. He was connected with the Burra District Council for over 25 years and for 15 was Chairman, doing all he could to promote the interests of the district. He was a pillar of St Mary’s Church where he had filled almost every office. He had the oversight of the building of the new rectory at Redruth and was on the building committee of the church when it was built. For several years he was in charge of Koonoona Station and later took up the property where he died. He became acquainted with the most prominent sheep owners in SA and as a judge of Merino sheep scarcely had a rival. [John Chesters Sandland, born Loppington Hall, Shropshire England 1845: died 12 December 1909 near Burra.]

Obituary. Mrs W. Escott of Koonoona died on Monday after a somewhat lengthy illness.

[Born Lucy Julinda Fisher: died 13 December 1909 at Koonoona.]

Viceroy Tea Carnival

A great crowd assembled on Victoria Park on Saturday to witness the balloon ascent arranged by Messrs Wilkinson & Co. of Adelaide as a novel way of advertising their Viceroy Tea. It created a big sensation. The inflation of the balloon was watched with great interest. At the report of a pistol shot, it was released and rose quickly some hundreds of feet, carrying with it Rinaldo, seated comfortably on a trapeze. At the climax he hung by his toes on the fast drifting balloon and then, hanging by his hands, he turned a complete somersault before taking his seat again. The crowd cheered. Another pistol shot was the signal for him to drop from the balloon and his body fell towards the earth rapidly, but suddenly a parachute opened and Rinaldo was seen seated on the trapeze, from which he saluted the crowd with a cheery wave of his hand. Eventually he landed somewhat uncomfortably in P.L. Killicoat’s woodheap at Abberton Park, sustaining a shaking and several cuts, but with his grit and determination undiminished. W.J. Richardson brought Rinaldo back to Victoria Park in his motor car.

Cr Hardy moved Council write to the Postmaster General suggesting suitable sites for a new post office and the probable cost of the same. Not 2nd.

He then called for a public meeting on 14 January to consider this matter. Carried.

The committee is to report next meeting on the cost of enclosing the SE portion of the cemetery.

The Mayor will talk to M-C Clarke re vandalism in Kooringa.

A New Kooringa Post Office.

A party comprising the Mayor (S. Burns), P. Lane & Dr Sangster jun. met the Hon. R.W. Foster and Mr Murdock, architect for public buildings, to look over the post office.

While there an unofficial delegation (not from the Council) waited on Mr Foster requesting that the post office be sited in Market Square. This revealed deep divisions in the town between those for a Market Square site and those for leaving it where it is.

Mr Crewes:

For Market Square as being more central to business. The Aberdeen end’s needs were met by their own post office. Costs of renovation were very heavy and it was better to start again.

John McLaren:

Supported Mr Crewes, despite living very near the present site. Several people would be prepared to buy the old building as a residence.

J. Drew:

Supported Mr Crewes’ arguments.

John Pearce:

Also supported Mr Crewes’ arguments.

S. Burns:

Sat rather uncomfortably on the fence, saying ‘there were two sides to the question.’

Mr Lane:

Thought the post office was in the right place now. Many Aberdeen people got their correspondence through the Kooringa post office. The best site was ‘certainly not Market Square’.

Dr Sangster:

The post office might fit in Market Square, but not the residence and as there is a Post Office Savings Bank Assoc. that serves Aberdeen people as well, the present site is better.

The Hon. R.W. Foster said it was the first he had heard of a request for a new site – he said he would pass on the deputation’s ideas, but warned that division in the town could only cause delay. Wherever the new post office was built they could rest assured it would be up-to-date.

Characteristics of the 1909 Paper.

Page 1.

Large advertisements: mainly, but not exclusively local.

Page 2.

Smaller advertisements, though some cross two columns. Stock sales and public notices, though the latter were less numerous than in some years. There are only occasional editorials. Small items on page 2 sometimes get lengthier treatment on page 3.

Page 3.

Longer news items and reports from regional correspondents. Often fleshed out with jokes. The ‘Short & Sharp’ column is less cryptic than some of its predecessors, but the news is annoyingly interspersed there with advertisements. There is little evidence of journalism. It seems the editor waited for people to drop things in most of the time.

Page 4.

There are larger advertisements, which are generally not local, but include a few local regulars. On rare occasions some news or reading matter may appear here. For most of the year there was a useful town directory in column 1.

Overall the paper did a rather poor job at covering local events. The Town Council gets little space and there are a number of things mentioned in ‘Short & Sharp’ that are of some significance, but do not get further coverage.

The column for 15 December is a good example of this.

‘Short & Sharp’

Boy Scouts still hard at work.

Balloon ascent on the park on Saturday was a sensational affair.

The Bishop of Pt Augusta visited Burra on Sunday.

Kooringa Methodist Church Hospital Service next Sunday.

Fire threatened L.W. Gebhardt’s wheat crop on Saturday.

The usual Hanson Methodist Church Anniversary will be held on Sunday with the tea meeting on Christmas Day when arrangements have been made for the trains to stop.

The first three of these items deserve further attention. The balloon event is particularly interesting, but receives virtually no attention.

The Municipal Elections are another example. S.M. Lane is said to be elected unopposed to East Ward. Then at the Ratepayers’ meeting he speaks, but does not appear in the results. The election for East Ward appears to elect Mr Ockenden to that position, but at the end of the year he is retiring through the effluxion of time, making it clear that the election was for the extraordinary vacancy created by Mr Crewes’ resignation to stand unsuccessfully for Mayor. This is typical of the careless handling of material this year.

Numbering of issues in 1909

Volume VX continued for the whole year, having started 12 July 1905.

The year began with Volume VX Number 834 on 6 January 1909

And continued to Volume VX Number 883 on 22 December 1909.

New Year. Pranks saw some mischief done, but little damage resulted. At 12 o’clock guns were fired, tins rattled and horns blown. The year appeared on shop shutters, though in several cases 1901 rather than 1910 was written and even 1190 appeared. One or two gates were unhinged.

Pilgrim Star, a horse due to run at World’s End, was got at on Friday night and dosed with a quantity of wheat. Police are investigating. (The Pilgrim Star that ran is a completely different horse.)

Competitions at Christmas Time.

Drew & Crewes asked children to draw their store. H. West won 1st prize of a huge lucky stocking for the 10-14 age group.

R. Henderson won 2nd prize of a silver-backed hairbrush and L. Joraslafsky won a box of chocolates by coming third.

For the 8-10 year-old group M. Tiddy won a box of chocolates for coming first, Violet Wardle got an electroplated jam dish for second prize and Arnold Heinrich won a hairbrush as third prize.

Urwin & Co. had over 6,000 attempts to guess the number of lollies in a bottle filled with sweets of many different sizes. Mrs Mitchell was first and won a travelling bag worth £2-2-0. Miss E. Oates came 2nd and won a salad bowl and Mrs W. McDonald came 3rd and won a lamp with globe.

Frank Harris’s ‘Stocking’ was to be won by guessing the name of the doll, but 70 guesses failed to nominate ‘Lucille’ and so Mr Harris gets to keep his stocking.

E.J. Harris offered an 8-day clock to the one who guessed the time it would stop. This was won by Mr R. Gurney and Mrs W. Lee came 2nd, winning 5 lb of tea.

World’s End Races were well attended and in every way successful, except they got behind time and some events had to be cancelled. As well as six horse races there was a Sheffield Handicap, a cotton-winding contest, a boys’ race, wood chopping and a couple of other foot races. Results in 11⁄4 columns.

There is also a humorous article of a bit over 1⁄2 column describing a day at the World’s End Races. Among the description of the group’s troubles they took the wrong road and ended at ‘Midwinter’s old hotel, which has long since been demolished.’

H.C. Farley writes saying the mine pool is the only place our boys can learn to swim, but at present it is dangerous. He wonders whether the Mayor can get permission for it to be equipped with ropes and other aids to make it a safe place to learn.

The editor comments that the Mayor agrees with this and will look into the best way of going about it.

Burra Sports were held at the new Aberdeen Oval on 27 December, run by the Burra Bicycle & Athletic Club. They were well patronised and well competed. Some 180 acceptances ensured a good meet. There was a concert in the evening at the Institute, followed by a dance.

Kooringa Methodist Sunday School held its annual picnic at Sod Hut on New Year’s Day by permission of Mrs J.C. Sandland. Over 200 scholars attended. A sports program was successfully carried out.

Burglary. On Friday 24 December thieves broke into the powder magazine, where Drew & Crewes store explosives, and stole c. £3-15-0 worth of dynamite and an unknown stock of powder. Having got through the outer door by breaking the lock, they used 3⁄4” piping to lever away the inner doorframe after drilling between it and the wall.

Burra Town Council.

Cr Hardy moved a letter be written to the Commissioner of Police re vandalism in the town.

It was resolved to write to the Hydraulic Engineer asking if water to extinguish fires would be available and at what cost. Resolved also to buy 150” of 11⁄2” hose for fire use.

Notice is to be given to SAMA to remove the wall at S. James’s old shop in Lower Thames St.

Serious Accident. On Boxing Day at Fingerpost Mr R. Sharpe was dragged out of his trap when his horse turned short and broke a shaft. The horse then bolted and eventually Mrs Sharpe was thrown out, fracturing a thigh. The couple endured a 10-hour ordeal in the sun in getting into Burra and the hospital, only reaching W. Baynes’s place Baldina at 8 p.m. and the hospital about 11 p.m.

Capt. J.A. Watt was in Burra on 24 December on his way to Quorn where he has been recently a traveller for a spirit merchant, but has resigned and will return to the city.

Marriage. On 28 December, Maud Short, daughter of the late Joseph short married Herbert Warner, 3rd son of Robert Warner of Redruth.

He will be given a social tonight and will be presented with a travelling bag etc.

Marriage. Molly Kunouth, who has been cook at the Burra Hospital for three years, is going west to marry Blake Mago, who was in Burra some time ago with the boring machine at the mine. She was given a send-off and dance at the Institute on 28 December.

Burra Hospital Christmas Tree was held on 22 December. It was the result of efforts by Miss Edith Cave.

Kooringa Police Court, 28 December.

John Nelson was charge with assaulting M-C Clarke on 26 December. M-C Clarke asked for no heavy fine, but merely for ‘the protection of the court.’

Mr Crewes JP was clearly annoyed at this and rather indignantly fined Nelson £1 plus costs.

Obituary. Johnson Carpenter died 6 January at Hanson aged 64. He was the husband of Emma carpenter and is survived by one son, two daughters and six grandchildren.

Mr Carpenter took up land at Baldina in the earlier days and farmed there till about 12 years ago when he went to Hanson. The deceased was ill for about six months and was at Burra hospital, but as the end approached he expressed a desire to go home. He is survived by a son and two daughters: Mr R.A. Carpenter (Hanson), Mrs George Clarke (Wallaroo) & Mrs W.H. Bray (Silverton) and six grandchildren.

Burra, Examining Centre for Adelaide University. Four candidates from Burra, Yarcowie, Hanson & Point Pass took advantage of the centre and all did very well. The centre also holds examinations for the School of Mines and in Music.

The Season. Harvesting is in progress and the grain quality is better than last year and this year is expected to see record deliveries of grain to Burra, Mt Bryan, Hallett & Farrell’s Flat Stations.

New Year’s Eve Dance at Leighton Hall raised £3-15-0 which will go to reducing hall debt. T. Kelly was the MC.

Mr P.J. Pickering will succeed Mr Macindoe at the Bank of Australasia.

Miss Edna L. Killicoat has passed the examination in the higher division for the Associated Board of the Royal Academy & Royal College of Music.

Trip to World’s End, 1 January. The day was hot, but pleasant with a nice breeze. Visitors on New Year’s Day could either watch the races or spread out their rugs under the gum trees and have a picnic. They could walk up the gorge to the world’s End Ranges and the beautiful waterfalls and admire the overhanging gum trees and stately pines. Scores of people availed themselves of the opportunity. The wheat yields in the vicinity have been most satisfying this season. There was not a blade of green to be seen, but there were a number of haystacks as farmers here provide well for their stock. All World’s End and his family were out for the day on 1 January.

Weather. Last week was most changeable. A thunderstorm on Saturday produced heavy rain for about 20 minutes with a great deal of thunder and lightning. About two hours later hailstones the size of marbles fell, followed by an even heavier rainstorm. The creek rose and washed away the recently constructed ford at the Pig & Whistle. Redruth received only about half the rain recorded in Kooringa where water penetrated a number of premises and caused considerable damage. Sunday was unsettled with sun and some showers. Petherton received about 11⁄2 inches of rain in 20 minutes while very little fell between Mt Bryan and Burra.

At Hanson a flash of lightning wrenched the hook from Mr Geyer’s hand as he was mixing concrete and concrete splashed in his eye causing him to be laid up for a few days. A carpenter at Hanson was also slightly shocked by a nearby strike.

At Booborowie on Thursday a storm caused local dams to be filled and lightning started several grass fires. Mr S. Pearce lost about 75 acres, but the fires were soon extinguished by rain.

At world’s End there was much thunder and lightning last week, but little rain till Sunday when a torrential downpour for a few minutes brought down the creeks and caused flows to dams. The wheat harvest is over, but flies are very troublesome to man and beast.

Fire on Christmas Day broke out in J. Melrose’s paddock at Hallett, but was soon controlled.

Wirth’s Circus at Aberdeen tonight.

Fresh applicants for the old age pension are continually cropping up in the district.

The Boy Scouts went into camp at the Gorge on Tuesday expecting to be away from home overnight.

Mr I.A. Macindoe was accorded a farewell social on Wednesday evening in Hon. J. Lewis’s old schoolroom. He has been in a prominent position at the Bank of Australasia for five years and active in all kinds of sports and social gatherings. The report extends for 3⁄4 column. Dr J.I. Sangster Jnr presided. S.M. Lane proposed Mr Macindoe’s health and presented him with a handsome dress travelling bag. Other speakers were: the Mayor Mr S. Burns, L.A. Lewis, G.E. Dane (Burra Music & Dramatic Club), Rev. Farley, F.T. Harcus (Manager of the Bank of Australasia), J.F. Moore (Manager of the National Bank), W.T. Truscott (Football Association), N. Pearce (Burra Rifle Club), W.J.C. Ewins (for dramatic work), A. Lott (Ramblers Football Club), L. Gebhardt (Burra Automobile Club) and Messrs Milner & Cameron spoke as associates. Mr Macindoe gave a firm and collected response and his review of his life in the town and acknowledgement of the kind words of the speakers provoked the comment that he ought to have been a politician.

The ladies of the Tennis Club presented him with a set of electroplated hair brushes and the Burra Rifle Club gave him two Barling pipes in a case, a cigar case & holder and a tobacco pouch.

Boy Scouts. Acting Scoutmaster Rev. H.C. Farley and Mr Lott of the Cadets have taken the Scouts to World’s End Gorge for tonight’s camp to qualify them as ‘Tenderfoots’.

Burra Institute AGM Monday night. President Mr Pederson presided over 11 subscribers. The Institute had a credit balance of £120-3-11. On 31 December 1909 there were 3,580 books after the addition of 159 and withdrawal of 731 for the year. Subscribers:

December 31 1908 there were 25 Double + 73 single for a total of 98.

December 31 1909 there were 21 Double + 85 single for a total of 106.

During the year the card system of issuing books was introduced, doing away with the day book and ledger.

The dressing room floors at the back of the stage had been covered with malthoid, which is a considerable improvement.

Elected were President, Mr Harcus; Vice-President, Mr Page; Treasurer, Mr Wilkinson & Secretary, Mr Moore.

Redruth Court

Sam Roy Morphett was fined £1 per head, reduced to 5/- each + costs to a total of £2-4-0 for branding four cattle in the wrong position.

Daniel Horan was fined £2 or 7 days in jail for being unlawfully on the premises of the Burra Hotel on Christmas Day.

George Lord of the Burra Hotel was charged with allowing Horan on the premises during the time the sale of liquor is prohibited. Horan’s evidence that he was refused a drink resulted in the charge being dismissed.

A charge against Henry Nourse for stealing hay from a paddock of Albert Thomas Fairchild near Booborowie was eventually dismissed.

A Bolt. Ada McDonald, daughter of Charles McDonald, had a lucky escape from injury when the horse she was driving to meet the train at Hallett bolted and capsized the vehicle. She escaped with a shaking.

Salvation Army. Activities of the Army remind us of long ago when the band was heard nightly in the streets, owing to the advent of Ensign and Mrs Reeve and a lassie who perform on the cornet, euphonium and second cornet respectively. Meetings so far have been well attended.

Lightning. On 2 January at World’s End the family of Mr M. Quinn and Miss Martha Hill (Burra) and J. O’Dea (Booborowie) were having supper during a thunderstorm when a terrific noise as of falling trees was heard outside. This was followed by a flash of lightning which apparently entered the house and struck Miss Hill, Mr Len Quinn and Mr O’Dea. Miss Hill was rendered unconscious for two hours, but the others suffered only severe pains in the head. For a moment the whole room seemed to be enveloped in flame. All have since recovered.

AOF, Court Unity held its annual meeting at Burra Institute on Friday night where there was a good attendance. PCR J.E. Greenwood presided. There are 230 members.

Wheat. A record load of something like 12 tons was delivered to the Burra Station on Friday – probably a state record. There were 144 bags of wheat on the wagon drawn by 11 fine horses comprising the teams of Messrs P. Heinrich and V. Webb. The wheat came from Koonoona. No breakages occurred till entering the station yard when the awkward turn resulted in a broken shaft and one wrenched tyre.

Farmers are warned that inspectors are looking for overloaded vehicles and offenders will be summarily dealt with.

Alf Gebhardt’s horse in his cart was frightened by a motor cycle on Saturday afternoon and in swerving crossed its legs and fell, cutting one knee to the bone, probably ending its usefulness. Mr Gebhardt retained his position, but Thomas Highett and young Bourman were thrown out.

W.H. Hardy has been assured by a memo from the Surveyor-General’s Office that if a miscellaneous lease were to be granted over the Yakkalo Reserve Section 253 Hd of Ayers, access to the water would be reserved to the public.

Kooringa Post Office. A meeting at the Institute to consider a site for a new post office was held on Friday, presided over by Mayor S. Burns. Mr Wise moved it stay where it was. Seconded by Cr Hardy and supported by Mr Fuss and Doctors Sangster Sen. & Jnr. Mr McLaren spoke against it, but the motion was carried with only 3 of the approximately 70 attending dissenting. The mayor has passed on the result to the Federal authorities and it is anticipated that renovation work on the old post office will soon commence.

‘Short & Sharp’

No clue has been discovered in the recent powder magazine robbery at Redruth.

[Redruth? It is likely to have been the powder magazine on the mine hill.]

Wirth’s Circus performed at Burra on Thursday night and repeated many old-time acts.

The Boy Scouts were conveyed to Norman farm where they had lunch and were then sent on by Mr A.J. McBride to the Gorge where they arrived by noon. Dinner followed, after which the tents were pitched. The afternoon was spent swimming and exploring. Tea was followed by a campfire concert. The night was cold, but the boys were prepared. After breakfast and a swim there was a trip down the creek and time was spent cray fishing and swimming. The party left about 2 p.m. and got home about 5 p.m.

## Opening of Mt Bryan Hall

The hall was opened on 16 February by Mr H.S. Stephens, Chairman of the District Council. Messrs Miller & Newland MPs came from the city by the midday train and the opportunity was taken to make representations to them about the inadequacies of the local school. A banquet was then partaken of in the new hall. Mr Miller spoke of the Government’s buying of Petherton some five years since and its subdivision into farms. Mr Newland said the building reflected the enterprise of the locals and he admired the building’s dimensions. All this was the result of closer settlement. He spoke of the need for better station facilities. The speeches and toasts are reported in detail. A tea was provided and then a concert followed by a dance. The proceeds are said to have been £30-£40. [Though in another column the figure is over £40.]

The hall is 44’ x 33’ x 18’ and the ceiling is of V jointed Oregon, the stage is 11’ deep and the windows are of cathedral glass. John Pearce was the contractor. A tennis match added to the enjoyment of those attending. My Bryan-Hallett defeated Burra by one game. There were also sports organised for the children as well as a cricket match.

SA House of Assembly Elections. Messrs O’Loughlin, Miller, Hannaford and Newland addressed voters at the Institute on 28 February.

Hannaford called himself a ‘Ministerialist’ [Which basically meant he was a conservative, but was free to criticise a conservative Government.] He was pro-government and anti-Labor. He was in favour of increasing the 75% of revenue going to the Federal Government, because of the extra expense of the old age pension. He favoured cutting up the large estates for closer settlement and even, perhaps, for compulsory purchase.

## VX, 893, 9 Mar. 1910, page 2-3

L. O’Loughlin was a Liberal and favoured closer settlement. He thanked voters for their previous support. He did not want to say anything against the Labor Party, but would continue as a Liberal. He objected to vulgar interruptions, but would answer any questions. In his term in office great things had taken place in respect to farming and this was due to the cutting up of large estates. The Bill was introduced in 1897, though it had not made much headway for some years – he went on to say more about developments around the state that were a consequence of closer settlement. He made reference to the franchise and to tax and to proposals to open up Eyre Peninsula where new railways were required. He thought the Commonwealth should take over the NT and that strikes should never be permitted.

## VX, 893, 9 Mar. 1910, page 3

J. Newland, Labor, was for abolishing the property qualification for the franchise and hoped at least to get it down below the present £15. Everything was done in the interest of the farmer and nothing in the interest of the labourer. NT should belong to SA and the recent negotiations on it were so secret that even the blotting paper was destroyed.

Mr Miller said the greatest changes during the last 8 years that he had worked for Burra had been in getting people onto the land and he hoped a major scheme for increased settlement would soon be brought about on Eyre Peninsula, where the land was even better than around Pinnaroo. The opening of new country would probably obviate the need for compulsory purchase. The Booleroo Centre and Angaston railways helped this closer settlement. He then mentioned the Pekina creek water scheme. He believed in a progressive land tax. The federal Government should take over the Northern Territory. It was dangerous to have such a large area lying idle. An interjector suggested that the ‘Japs’ might ‘collar it’.

Women’s Branch of National Defence League held a social at the Institute on 25 February when Hon. J. Lewis presided. Mr Bakewell, President of the ANL*, which supported Gordon Charlston & Shannon for the House of Representatives addressed the meeting. The great question was Commonwealth finances because more money was needed for the old age pension and for defence. He believed that Labor men were not entitled to power in the [SA] House of Assembly. A district like Burra should be governed by representatives of the NDL.

[*The Australian National League would appear to have been an alternative name for the National Defence League.]

Miss Farr spoke on the inappropriateness of the Labor Party to represent the district.

Hon. R.W. Foster urged the ladies to educate their children in the ways of politicians just as the Labor Party did their children. He was against revolutionary socialism and pointed to Broken Hill and Newcastle as examples of Labor’s unacceptability. On the financial referendum they must vote ‘Yes’.

Refreshments and dancing followed.

Obituary. Mr Isaac McNeil, son-in-law of Mr E. Cock of Ayers Forest, met with a fatal accident on 5 March at Redhill. The horse in a spring dray would not start and he got down to induce it to move.

Although medical assistance was to hand he died in less than 40 minutes. He was married to the only daughter of Mr & Mrs Cock about 21⁄2 years ago.

Local Option Poll

Rev. John Paterson spoke to a fair number of people at the Institute on this question. Rev. T. Weatherill presided. He referred to recent disgraceful scenes in Adelaide where an organised mob threw eggs at a meeting organised to promote local option. ‘The drink traffic was a curse, and should be wiped off the face of the earth.’ Local option was not the idea of a few cranks as alleged by some. He referred to efforts in Iceland and Switzerland and to New Zealand licensing laws. He illustrated his appeal for abstinence with anecdotes of various people’s paths of self destruction. E.J. Davey moved the vote of thanks which was seconded by Mr Sara.

C.A. Horne the Unification Candidate for the Division of Wakefield writes on the desirability of doing away with the Australian States.

A Bolt. A horse attached to a masher cart got free from a post it was tied to on Thursday afternoon and bolted. It successfully got between several traps and careered up Ayers St, turned into George St, negotiated the Pig & Whistle crossing and the turn into Thames St, traversed Market Square and took the Adelaide Road. At Connor’s old place it encountered a closed gate and returned via Commercial St to Market Square and then went north to be eventually caught at the Royal Exchange Hotel. In all this no damage had been done except the initial breaking of the strap attached to the bit.

The Kooringa Auction Mart premises of Messrs Reid & Co. are to be extensively remodelled to make a very convenient motor garage for Messrs Murray Aunger Ltd of Adelaide.

The dayman withdrew the expression.’

[The previous Council report in the paper does not reveal what this refers to.]

Obituary. The late Mrs Catherine Flower who died on 14 March aged 65 collapsed the previous Sunday at dinner with severe head pains and died 14 hours later. She came to SA when two years old. After her marriage the couple went to Canowie for seven years before returning to Stony Gap and making their home there. Mrs Flower was a most helpful church worker and had furthered its interests in many ways since 1860. A husband, six daughters and five sons survive: Mrs G. Parker (Copperhouse), Mrs S. Jeffrey (Booborowie), Mrs Mark Jeffrey (Porter’s Lagoon), Mrs C. Heinrich (Copperhouse), Miss Amy & Miss Ethel at home, James (Braefoot), William (WA), Joseph (Canowie Belt), John (Stony Gap), Frank (Coonalpyn) and 28 grandchildren. 55 traps took part in the funeral.

Obituary. Mr George Camp was the second son of Mr Elliott Camp of Aberdeen. The deceased was taken ill in November, but recovered somewhat before illness again overtook him. He was operated on for an abscess in the ear and sent away to rest and recuperate. A few days ago he returned and required a further operation which seemed to have been successful, but apparently the abscess had worked itself on the brain and he died on Tuesday night. He had been connected with the Aberdeen Football Club and was a good son, steady and industrious.

Lane (Burra Musical & Dramatic Club), Mr Gebhardt (Burra Automobile Club), L.A. Lewis (Burra Racing Club), Rev. H.L. Ebbs (The Anglican Church) and various personal friends all spoke. The Mayor then made the presentation of a gold watch and chain. Dr Sangster replied saying he was leaving for two main reasons: to be better able to keep an eye on his sons when their time came to go to school and he wanted to rub shoulders with other medical men with a view to making further progress in his profession.

A public welcome was then accorded Dr Caw who is taking over Dr Sangster’s practice.

Burra Races were held last Wednesday in ideal weather and generally passed off well, though there were several unfortunate occurrences. [Surely something of an understatement!]

J.M. Cummings’ Myrtle was first past the post and a gate was opened for the entrance to the weighing-in paddock, but before reaching the scales Cummings dismounted and there was naturally a protest which was upheld.

In the Squatter’s Handicap the heavily backed chestnut Rifleman was left standing at the start causing much excitement among backers.

In the Welter the same thing happened with T. Barry’s Sunshine with the veritable Tim Wilks in the saddle. Four horses ran the race and places were declared, but then something happened [which is not disclosed and appears to be unknown to the reporter] and the race was declared a ‘no start’. It was then started again and this time Wilks got away and just managed to beat Fortola which had run first in the aborted event. As the writer not unreasonably observes, if Fortola had not just run two races to Sunshine’s one it would easily have won.

The Hurdle Race failed altogether when only one horse went to the starting post and according to the rules got half the stake.

The results are printed.

The deceased left home a couple of days earlier to go to Wonna scrub for some posts. He reached there, loaded the posts and started back. He stayed at Hallett overnight and the next day got to within three miles of home. The accident was not witnessed, but he seems to have been applying the brake when he overbalanced and fell onto the road. One wheel passed over the body. He seems to have managed to call to the horses to stop while in the act of falling, as they stopped before the second wheel reached him and remained there quietly until 5 o’clock when the Messrs Kelly came along and found the body. After the enquiry do inquest was deemed necessary.

A Railway Siding is being called for some 4 to 5 miles north of Saddleworth to ease the traffic for Apoinga, Emu Downs and Tothill’s Belt, etc.

Big Burra Fire

Early last Friday [April 8] morning fire was found to have taken a strong hold on the offices of W.J. Davey of the Burra Record and of the shop of Mr S.M. Lane, saddler and ironmonger. The only water available was from household tanks and the Market Square pump. A bucket line of men and women worked hard, some of them from the roof of adjacent buildings. The fire seems to have started at the rear of the buildings, but it has not been ascertained at which of them. All that could be done was to prevent the spread of the fire to the adjoining premises of T.W. Wilkinson, chemist and L.L. Wicklein, jeweller. The front room of Lane’s shop was soon cleared of stock, which was thrown onto the roadway. Mr Lane came in time to rescue his books and some valuable property, as did Mr Davey.

The four inch main of town water, which passes the properties could not be used.

Mr Lane’s losses have been covered by insurance, but Mr Davey will have losses of £500 in excess of the insurance cover. Several of those present received minor injuries. Mr J. Urwin tripped over his own skylight. On young man called Herbert fainted and another called Williams received a nasty gash from a sheet of corrugated iron. Some helpers behaved rashly and even foolishly – removing packages of ironmongery, but leaving flammable materials that fed the flames – or ‘saving’ boxes of lamp glasses by throwing them onto the metalled road. The calm night was all that prevented the fire from spreading disastrously. Mr Lane will be able to begin trading once he has sorted his stock, but the Burra Record will be closed for some time, pending the provision of type, machinery and stock. Several items of Mr Lane’s rescued stock were stolen.

Letter. ‘Warning’ writes with reference to the recent Market Square fire, saying that behind the shops in Market Square there was a festering mass of rubbish that authorities had allowed to accumulate. There was a foul stench apparently arising from a mass of ancient eggs and very bad fruit, under a pile of cases and other timber. This should not be allowed in any circumstances.

Kooringa Football Club held its AGM at Lord’s Burra Hotel on Tuesday. S.M. Lane presided. The club was reported to have a small credit balance. Secretary J. Allen tendered his resignation.

Lewis MLC; several Vice-Presidents; Captain, R. Hill; Vice-Captain, W. Kellaway and R. Johnson was appointed Secretary pro tem.

Recent Election Results in the Burra district show it is time for the Liberals to get organised. The Labor Party has given them an insight into getting organised – with the latter having all its forces at work, while the Liberals relied upon one or two, who were undoubtedly the means of saving the party from total extinction.

Halley’s Comet has caused many people to crawl out of bed in the early morning to catch a glimpse of this visitor. [The paper then gives times for the comet’s rising, which varied from 4.34 a.m. to 4.04 a.m. between 22 April and 30 April.]

The Federal Election

Labour will have a substantial majority in both Houses of Parliament. Of the 18 vacancies in the Senate, Labor won them all.

Streetlighting. Burra Town Council is beginning to see the need for better streetlighting. It has agreed to a proposal from Cr Ockenden for a lamp on the corner of Quarry and Kingston Streets to add to the 8 or 10 already in position. [As already noted, these two streets do not intersect. If it was in Kingston Street perhaps the intersection with East Street was meant, as that would be near the Salvation Army Citadel, but that is sheer speculation.]

The Kooringa Methodist Church Hall was the scene for an evening of unusual competitions last Friday. A few weeks ago the Girls Church-aid Club entertained the young men. On Friday the young men reciprocated with an evening of items and competitions.

The Railways. There are frequent complaints that trains arriving at Burra are up to half an hour late – in a 100 mile run this is preposterous.

The Burra Music & Dramatic Club. The Mutual Improvement Section met for the first time on Thursday when the Rev. Farley of the Methodist Church gave an address on ‘Elocution’.

Mt Bryan is showing signs of prosperity and improvement.

Thirty years ago this was one of the busiest spots on the railway. This was before the construction of the railway from Burra. [Sic]

[This is rather confusing. What the writer is attempting to say is that more than thirty years ago, before the extension of the railway north from Burra in 1878, this spot on the road north was very busy.]

It was a huge camping site for teamsters and others around the ‘Flat’, that area in the vicinity of the old District Council Chamber and not far from the old hotel that was some two miles north of the present town and which did remarkable business. Several years passed in which Mt Bryan was a town in name only – though that name was kept in the news by the district’s high quality of merino sheep production. Then wheat and hay production was introduced and the pastoral land became top-priced agricultural land. The district became populated by prosperous producers and the township is now busier than ever.

There are now besides the railway station four or five stores, an hotel, many dwelling houses, school buildings, a new public hall, postal, telegraph and telephonic accommodation, a blacksmith shop and a group of wheat agents’ offices. The Agricultural Bureau is well alive, as is the District Council. There are Methodist, Anglican and Catholic Church services and an active Music & Dramatic Club and a literary society. There are cricket, football and tennis clubs and other sporting bodies. As well as being the centre of a cereal producing district, it remains well-known for producing some of the best merino sheep in Australia.

Ratepayers’ Meeting

Last Thursday a meeting was held to discuss improvements to Market Square in place of the present structure around the pump. There was a large attendance and Mayor S. Burns presided.

Cr Wise said it would soon be necessary to remove the present unsightly structure and also the trees, which were interfering with the pipes. It was suggested that there be a wall topped with a steel railing; the enclosure to be in the shape of a horseshoe.

Mr George Sampson said that if something were done to improve the square he would be prepared to contribute a ‘fiver’.

Mr C. Fuss thought the Council was correct to consult with the ratepayers and he would like to see improvements if the costs were not too high.

Mr John Pearce would also support the work if at reasonable cost.

Crs Walker from North Ward and Lane & Ockenden from East Ward were opposed to any of the costs coming from their respective wards.

Cr W.H. Hardy supported the improvement scheme and thought it could be done for little cost to the Council. He moved that the Mayor start a fund with a view to erecting a suitable enclosure in Market Square, that the Council be asked to assist and that the proposed structure be dedicated to the memory of the late King Edward VII, bearing a suitable inscription or stone and that the Town Council be a committee to attend to the matter on behalf of the citizens and the town.

Cr Wise seconded and Crs Walker, Lane & Ockenden withdrew their objections.

Mr John Drew then expressed his support, but said it might be best not to confine the matter to the town, but to invite the sympathy of the residents of the whole district.

Cr Hardy then said that if Cr Wise was agreeable, they would withdraw his proposal in favour of something along the lines suggested by Mr Drew. Cr Wise agreed and Mr Drew then proposed:

‘That a public meeting of the residents of the town and district be called for Friday June 3 at 7.30 p.m., to discuss the whole matter and deal with same.’ Seconded by F. Treloar and carried.

Burra & the North East Agricultural, Horticultural & Pastoral Society. (The Show Society)

The AGM was held in Burra Institute last Friday. More than 60 people attended and P.L. Killicoat presided. Secretary Mr Frank Treloar tabled the balance sheet that showed the society to be in good funds. He said that the past two years had given the district many new residents and he had therefore sent out circulars to newcomers as well as old supporters. After discussion the date of the next show was chosen as Wednesday 5 October. Officers elected: Patron, Hon. J.J. Duncan MLC; President (for two years, when a new president must be appointed) P.L. Killicoat; and a number of Vice-Presidents.

[Stewards are then listed.]

It was decided to hold a sheepdog trial in connection with the show and Mr W.G. Hawkes & Mr T.H. Pearse moved it be on 2 August. Carried.

[It is surprising then that an advertisement immediately after this article gives the Show date as 5 October and the dog Trial date as Wednesday 10 August. Subsequently this was proved correct.]

Burra Town Council last Thursday met in connection with improvements to Market Square.

Cr Wise presided in the absence of the Mayor with influenza. Crs Lane, Walker and Ockenden were absent. Crs Hardy & Lowe moved that Council offer a site in Market Square about 40 ft by 50 ft for the purpose of the proposed enclosure. This was carried and will be put to the public meeting.

Obituary. Rev. Father Redden died on Wednesday last aged 38 at the residence of his parents at Pekina.

He was a patron and supporter of the local football clubs. For a time he was president of the Burra Association. About six years ago he left on an extended trip abroad in a search for health, but on his return developed consumption. [James Patrick Redden died 1 June 1910 at Pekina, residence Kooringa aged 40.]

Mr R. Gull of the SAR has been transferred from Mt Bryan to Adelaide after a stay of three years. He will be missed as a local preacher in the Methodist Church, leader of the local Band of Hope and a leading member of the Endeavour Society.

Public Meeting re Market Square

The Mayor S. Burns presided over the meeting and said the Council had decided to provide a suitable site in Market Square of about 50 ft in the centre of the square and to ask the assistance of the whole town and district. He said if they raised about £150 they could erect a worthy enclosure. Cr Wise moved ‘That in the opinion of this meeting it is desirable to erect a suitable enclosure in Market Square in memory of the late King Edward VII.’ This was seconded by Mr C.A. Fuss and carried.

Burra Rifle Club met on Tuesday at Lord’s Burra Hotel to hand over the two prizes won in recent competitions. The Mackerode Silver Cup went to Mr Clem Pearce and the Davey Photograph of World’s End Creek went to Mr F. Wheatley.

Mounted Constable Clark was farewelled.

Mr William Davey, District Clerk, has resigned on account of advancing age. He is one of the oldest residents and was employed as a clerk in the Burra Mine. He was afterwards for many years caretaker of the Institute and then Town Clerk before taking on the clerkship of the District Council.

Applications are called for the position of District Clerk.

No. 3,557, Vol. XLVI, 1 July 1910, pages 3 & 6

The SA Railways gave a special passenger train a trial run on Friday to record times and other particulars pertaining to rail traffic. It is rumoured that due to heavy passenger traffic on the line there is a need for an express to Burra in the morning, stopping only at Riverton for breakfast and returning in the afternoon, stopping all stations. Thousands living in the Mid North would hail such a new departure.

Page 6 explains this further.

The idea would be to run such an express occasionally on Fridays. It would be a boon to Burra stock markets, enabling buyers to reach Burra in time for the start of sales and by returning after the present afternoon passenger train, would mean buyers would not have to run away before the sales were over.

Burns, when there was a large attendance of ladies and gentlemen. Mr H. Roach was elected President and Mr J. Thompson, Secretary. Speeches in support were given by Rev. T. Weatherill, Mr H. Roach, Mr J. Tapp, Mr C.A. Fuss, Mr H. Thomas, Rev. Lower (Curate of St Mary’s) and Mr George Bartholomaeus.

Editorial on the phoenix-like return of the Burra Record after the fire, which destroyed it recently. Thanks are extended to all those who helped in containing the fire and especially to the men and women who ‘manned’ the pump in the middle of the night. [Unfortunately which night is not stated. 8 April MS] [The description of the effort suggests that women pumped water to fill tubs and then men carried buckets to the fire, where a chain of eight got the water up to the top of the wall to pour it onto the fire.] Water from tanks behind the building was also used. The front room was saved, but the machinery suffered through the heat and all the stationery was destroyed by smoke and the front windows were smashed. The wall the men had stood on was so weakened that it had to be rebuilt and it was very lucky that it survived to support the men without collapsing into the flames with them. The Record suffered heavy losses, but has risen now with the finest plant of any provincial paper in SA. At the moment we cannot yet work in our new and commodious offices. We start again today with an increase in circulation, which is already the largest of any provincial press in SA. The Record circulates in the mid-north, north and northeast of SA and across the border into Queensland. The fire destroyed all the back premises and with it all the type and the photographic studio. This is now being rebuilt two storeys high* to become one of the largest and best lit studios anywhere. The neighbouring shop of S.M. Lane also suffered. Thanks are also extended to the providers of tea, coffee and eatables during the firefighting effort.

[Advertisements make it clear the rebuilding was on the same site in Market Square.]

Elsewhere on the page there is a report that the new premises include a lofty and well-ventilated composing room that is well lit by acetylene gas. It was built by John Pearce.

[*But note that the report in VX, 902, 17 Aug. 1910, page 3 describes a three storey building, which photographs would seem to verify. It is ironic that this building was also destroyed by fire: see Burra Record Vol.76, 50, 19 Dec. 1950, page 1]

Marriage. On 2 July in Sydney Muriel Lane, the youngest daughter of P. Lane married C.W. Hooper. They will live in Cobar.

The Football Crisis.

On 4 July the names of H. Williams, A. Carroll, H. Gordon and E. Raymond were submitted by Kooringa for registration by the Association. Aberdeen held a meeting and voted that their delegates be instructed not to allow their registration for Kooringa. After a warm discussion at the next Association meeting the Aberdeen delegates left the room.

A recent rule says ‘no player be allowed to play for any club . . . living outside a radius of 12 miles and any player must reside in the district 14 days before being allowed to play for any club’.

The men in question have complied with this, but Aberdeen believes if they are allowed to play a game they then qualify to play in the final whether residents or not. Both Aberdeen and Kooringa have broken the previous rule in the past. The men in question are presently playing with the Clare Club, which is in the Mid-Northern Association, of which rule 22 forbids playing for more than one associated club without the consent of the executive, which Aberdeen says has not been given. Aberdeen says it has withdrawn from competition for the rest of the season. The Association has passed a resolution not allowing matches to be played on Aberdeen oval without Association approval. G.R. Maxwell has resigned as Association Captain to be replaced by R.J. Hill. Farrell’s Flat, Mt Bryan and Hallett teams are being asked to join the Association for 1911. The match with Broken Hill today will not include any of the Aberdeen players.

Truscott, Chairman of the Burra Football Assoc. writes to thank the Record for its fair reporting of the current dispute and says the only solution is for the Aberdeen Club to ask the Kooringa Club to withdraw the players in contention as delegates to the Association can only act in accordance with their club’s instructions.

The German Chapel Fire.

The old German Chapel at the rear of the Court House Hotel was destroyed by fire last week. The origin of the fire is a mystery. No alarm was raised. Mr C. Lowe was in the building the previous night cleaning the lamps and left c. 9 p.m. At about 10 p.m. a light was seen in the building, but was assumed to be a meeting. Even at 11 p.m. no one thought of a fire. Later a resident found the fire and tried to extinguish it with buckets of water from the creek, giving up only after falling in. Cpl Gibbons attended, but by then could only watch. The greatest losers are the Oddfellows Lodge in Aberdeen, who held meetings there and who lost their regalia, records and dispensation boards etc. The building was uninsured and no inquiry into the fire was held. [See next issue for clarification of this last point.] The Germans held monthly meetings in it, but another place will now have to be arranged.

No. 3,575, Vol. XLVI, 4 November 1910, page 6

Obituary. Mrs Jane Harvey, an old resident of Burra died in the Adelaide Hospital last week after a short illness. She was the mother of Mrs John Peak of Hanson and Mrs W.E. Jordan of Kooringa.

[This report seems to me to be wrong, though checking the background is not straightforward. Mrs Margaret Harvey died 23 October 1910 and was buried in Burra Cemetery 24 October 1910. Both sources say she was 74. Death registration however, gives the place of death and residence as Kooringa. The age suggests a birth c. 1836. Her marriage to John Harvey in 1865 suggests a birth date c. 1839. She does though, seem to be the mother of Mesdames Peak and Jordan.]

He left six daughters and two sons – George & Walter Ley of Farrell Flat.

Mr & Mrs H.C. Rundle & Miss Muriel Rundle were given a farewell by the Kia-Ora Tennis Club on the eve of their departure for Petersburg.

The Season

The outlook has never been better for both wheat growers and pastoralists in the Burra district. The new wheat areas around Shafton, Braefoot, Mt Bryan, Petherton, Koonoona and to the northwest and southeast generally are expected to break records. A few areas are infested with dandelion and they will need careful handling. Averages of 20-30 bushels are talked of. Farmers in the Mt Bryan area are jubilant.

For pastoralists lambing was good and shearing is expected to cut out considerably better than expected a few months since.

Dairymen also are having a profitable time.

Kooringa Cottage Homes

Recently five cottage homes directly opposite the Methodist Church, built by Mr J. McBride for the use of the worthy poor, were declared open by the Rev. Vivian Roberts, the President elect of the Methodist Church of South Australia. They are built on the site of old mine cottages, which had stood for many years, but which had become dilapidated eye-sores. The new buildings were erected by John Pearce & Sons and are replete in every comfort and convenience. Mr & Mrs McBride and family attended. Mr McBride, in handing over the deeds said it was simply a gift to God to be held in trust by the Methodist Church for the use of those worthy poor people who needed a home at the close of their lives. Rev. Roberts expressed his pleasure at accepting such a trust from ‘one who had done so much in his long life for his needy fellow creatures’. The visitors then inspected the buildings and expressed pleasure and delight at the cosy and homelike appearance of the dwellings.

Special Article on ‘The Gums’

[The article includes four poorly reproduced photos of sheep and a poor quality photo of the homestead.]

At one time farmers tried to cultivate the vast stretches of land between Burra and the Murray. For a year or two barns were filled with wheat, but soon the climate prevailed and one after the other the farms were abandoned and the story of how T.H. Pearse built up ‘The Gums’ is typical of others in this respect. After its recital one must eliminate all suggestions of ‘luck’ in connection with its success.

The property is now like one immense grassed prairie. ‘The Gums’ may be reached from Mt Mary or Morgan on the North Eastern Railway or from Burra on the main Northern Line. Mt Mary is the nearest rail point and the post town. [The article continues as the report by a visit of a reporter.]

I was met by Mr Harold Pearse, the youngest son of T.H. Pearse, who drove him from the Morgan railway station to the homestead at 20 m.p.h. in a 7 h.p. Swift, covering the 25 miles in 11⁄4 hours. There I was welcomed warmly. Shearing was in progress. The mail had started an hour before us, but arrived an hour later.

The homestead is on a rise north of a magnificent belt of gum trees, from which the property takes its name. The trees mark a big swamp, which is watered when the Burra creek overflows. The garden and lawn are objects of Mrs Pearse’s care and attention. A permanent supply of water has allowed a great range of flowers to be grown. Climbers and standards flourish.

T.H. Pearse has been on the property for 26 years. In 1884 in conjunction with Mr W. Cockrum he bought it from Mr R.J. McBride. The partnership lasted until 1895 when it was dissolved by mutual consent. Mr Pearse stayed on. He has three sons; B.W., N.H. and H.L. Pearse. B.W. Pearse was for some time the owner of Caroona Station some 40 miles northwest of ‘The Gums’. The second and third sons went to Roseworthy Agricultural College and now assist in the management of ‘The Gums’.

Mr Norman is in partnership with his father in the firm of Thomas H. Pearse & Son and lives at Corra Linn, about two miles away and the two homesteads are connected by telephone. The station covers some 95,000 acres of saltbush country, 15,000 acres having been bought in the last few months from Mr Harold Pearse, the youngest son. This vast area has in its time been practically devoid of feed and Mr Pearse can relate awful tales of droughts endured. In one such in an eighteen month period only 11⁄2 inches of rain fell and thirteen thousand sheep died – that was in 1889. The 1901-02 period was another terrible drought. The average rainfall is 9 inches. In the last year or two the gauge has measured c. 16 years. [Sic: presumably a misprint for inches.]

As the struggling farmers in the Hundred of Bundey fell, he gathered their properties one after the other – adding 33 such holdings to the original station. The South Australian Legislature was slow to acknowledge this change and short term tenure offers no inducement for expenditure on fences, water supply etc. Only in the last dozen or so years were those who persevered given comparative security of tenure with perpetual leasing and long leases, with right of purchase. This has encouraged investment in improvements.

Except for about five miles the whole of ‘The Gums’ is now protected by vermin-proof fencing and that gap will be closed this year. Paddocks range from 1,500 to 7,000 acres and are arranged to take best advantage of feed and water. Foxes are present, but keep down rabbits and the loss of 5-7% of the lambs to them is a bearable price to pay for that benefit. There are more than 30 dams on the property with a capacity of more than 20,000,000 gallons and dispersed so that no paddock is unsupplied. Water on hand now will serve for about eighteen months. Dams range in size from 175,000 to 2,100,000 gallons and two wells give an inexhaustible supply of good stock water. Burra Creek touches one corner for about 4 miles. Further bores are being put down to test the idea that the waters of Baldina Creek flow underground across the property. One bore at 164 ft is in operation in support of this theory.

Almost the whole of Mr Pearse’s efforts have been directed for some years to the raising of big framed strong-wooled merinos, which he has proved can be raised on saltbush country without special protection and are inured to the trials of a hot dry climate. The had observed that wool in the east had a tendency to become light and thus lose character and he aimed to retain that character.

In 1890 he shore 38,000 for 500 bales and in 1909 he shore 16,000 for 420 bales.

For all the conservation of feed, less management work and labour and better supervision of the smaller flock he gained greater commercial value of the sheep for a cost of 80 bales of wool. The average weight of shorn fleeces has increased 50%.

Last year 12,000 sheep averaged 12 lb each and the lambs a little over 4 lb.

This year they expect 13 lb and more than 5 lb respectively.

In establishing this flock Mr Pearse has secured the Koonoona and Murray merinos – large framed, grass-fed and strong wooled. He has culled anything indicating deterioration and now rears his own rams with occasional imported stud rams from the Koonoona-Wanganella strain and aims always to breed true to type.

The flock of stud ewes of 450 should average 18 lb fleeces this year.

In a drive around the property we saw lambs five months old that were almost as big as their mothers. These sheep are well suited to saltbush country and the lands opening back from the River Murray and the fame of the Pearse Stud is spreading.

Lambing at ‘The Gum’s takes place in March and April and this year there was a drop of 4,600 at a rate of over 90%.

Early on he suffered from overstocking, but has learnt that a safe rate is one sheep to 5 acres and now runs 15,000 to 20,000 sheep depending on the year. This year he could have run nearly 50,000, but prefers to look at keeping twelve months’ feed in reserve. Since the 1902 drought broke bare patches have been filling up and while the ground is not yet entirely covered, it does not bear the barren look, which is the despair of the pastoralist.

In the area fed by the overflow of Burra creek green feed persists to Christmas every year that has anything like a flood. Rich clover, succulent spinach, geranium and a wonderful variety of indigenous grasses and bushes grow in profusion.

This has been a marvellous season for the east and there is an abundance of cotton, salt and blue bushes, barley, silver, canary, prairie and spear grasses. The sheep have become choosey, being able to pick the choicest morsels. We drove through 6,000 acres of black spear grass 3 ft 6 inches high and yet in one drought year 3,000 lambing ewes were kept alive there on sandalwood that ‘all hands and the cook’ broke down for them.

The timber consists mainly of little mallee, myall, sandalwood, black oak and bullock bush, with magnificent stands of gums along the creek near the homestead. Rank growth of the tobacco tree is a problem that has spread over the swamp. Mr Pearse thinks that the seed must have washed down the creek in floods from the Burra area.

This year ‘The Gums’ will shear some 18,000 animals. The shed has eight stands and is fitted with the Moffat-Virtue Sheep Shearing Machines, driven by a 4 b.h.p. petrol engine. The Federal Sheep Shearing Company has the contract and they supply the shearers, overseer and book-keeper. The wool classing is done by students from the School of Mines under a foreman from the same.

The station has also bred splendid horses, suitable for the remount service. The name of T.H. Pearse & Son is well known in the half-yearly shows held in Adelaide by the royal Agricultural Society and at other shows.

Obituary. Thomas Hastie was born near Glasgow in 1826, where he was engaged in farming. He arrived in SA on the Shackmexon in January 1853 and worked as a farmhand near Gumeracha and then at Angaston and Dempsey Vale and then as a partner with George Mellor at Tanunda before buying a farm at South Rhine*. He first arrived in Burra shortly after the mines were discovered and carted copper ore to Pt Adelaide. He acquired a farm at Ironmine and after retiring from farming visited England with his wife in 1883. He had a shrewd knowledge of farming and stock and was a man of high principles.

[*The Hundred of South Rhine was renamed Hundred of Jutland on 10 January 1918. The sequence of events listed above seems a little odd. 1853 is 8 years after the mine started and the carting statements do not fit well with the farming statements for Barossa Valley areas. His retirement is suggested at age 57, which is possible, but rather young given that his health apparently allowed him to live to 84. I would suggest treating this account with caution.]

Booborowie District. There is a 1-column article inspired by the closer settlement scheme.

To North Booborowie (just purchased by the Government for closer settlement) you go southwest from Hallett through Cartapoo, through some magnificent farms. Previously it was worked by Alf. Coon and John Wise, the latter now a successful dairy farmer at Burra and a bacon producer. The country around Cartapoo and Petherton was once owned by C. Goode, but is cut up into agricultural blocks.

Nearing Booborowie you find the old stock road growing wheat and hay. You can get a history of the area from Ted Wall, a very old resident, who runs the Booborowie Eating House, Post Office and store etc. Booborowie currently boasts two churches (Methodist and Catholic), a District Council Chamber and a public school.

Booborowie was first taken up by the Doctors Brown in 1845 and after the death of Doctor Brown in 1897 it was divided. The Homestead and southern half was retained by Mr Brown, the Doctor’s son and the present owner. The northern half was bought by Messrs Dutton & Melrose and they produced magnificent sheep and cattle. Booborowie Station was managed for 20 years by Mr J. Loudon and since his death by Mr B. H. Beaven. Now that the Government has bought the greater portion many changes are in store for the district.

There are also complaints about the timetable, which has been changed to the disadvantage of many, but especially those attending the saleyards. The editor considers that allowing four hours for a journey of 100 miles is hardly a great sign of advancement.

A Notable Car Trip.

W.J. Richards conveyed John Collins and Mr Edwards (a relative) from Collinsville north on the 8 December in a 12 h.p. Talbot, to inspect new grazing country near Lake Frome. They left Collinsville at 5 a.m. and got to Yunta about noon. They proceeded via Waukaringa and Mt Victor to Coonamore and Curnanona, arriving by 6 p.m. having gone some 180 miles. The next day they went via Coondappie, Wilpina and Outowie to Frome Downs, about 40 miles. After travelling about 246 miles in all, including inspecting part of the property, the party started back and reached Frome Downs that night. They left the next morning at 5 a.m. and reached Curnamona in two hours. They reached Yunta for lunch, leaving at c. 2 p.m. and were at Terowie by 6 p.m. and Collinsville by 7.15 p.m. They covered 260 miles for the day and over 500 in the three days – all without a hitch.

Characteristics of the 1910 paper.

Page 1.

Large advertisements, both local and others.

Page 2.

Notices and moderate size local advertisements. Advertisements for stock sales, entertainments, coming events etc. There are no editorials and the news begins here as small items mixed with advertisements that appear very similar. This may extend to two columns.

Page 3

News continues with a couple of larger advertisements and news-like advertising.

Page 4

Larger advertisements and a column of the town directory. There is a column of humour in fluctuating amount.

After the fire.

Page 1

Much the same as before.

Page 2

Advertisements increase in number and the news contracts often to less than one column, but can be as much as almost two. There are a few editorials.

Pages 3 & 4

Much as before.

Overall the paper shows few signs of very active reporting and there is relatively little editorial comment. The extended illness of the editor and proprietor in the latter part of the year cannot have helped in maintaining the paper’s vitality. Locals do seem to have rallied round with advertising after the disastrous fire early in the year.

Numbering of issues in 1910

Volume VX continued for the whole year, having started 12 July 1905.

The year began with Volume VX Number 884 on 5 January 1910

And continued to Volume VX Number 920 on 21December 1910.

Within this sequence the numbering was consistent except that number 897 was used twice and number 903 was left out.

The New Kooringa Methodist Sunday School Kindergarten was opened last Sunday, 1 January.

Footpaths. People are complaining that storekeepers are leaving cases on footpaths in front of their shops: sometimes with jagged hoop iron and nails protruding, which can catch on clothing.

Kooringa Methodist Sunday School picnic was held last Monday at Sod Hut grounds.

Drew & Crewes held a Christmas competition to guess the name of a huge doll securing a gigantic Christmas stocking. But not one of the more than 200 entries guessed the name was ‘Mavis’ so the stocking has remained the property of the firm. We would suggest distributing the contents to the children.

Influenza, whooping cough, typhoid fever and other diseases have been prevalent of late.

Burra Hospital benefited by £25 from door money taken at the sale of Hill River land in Burra recently.

The New Year was welcomed quietly. No doubt its being a Sunday induced some residents to abstain from some of the less creditable acts of the past. A few lads threw stones on roofs, but otherwise peace prevailed.

Burra Primary School broke up on 22 December, but few parents attended due to the very rough weather. Mr Scott the headmaster expects to be transferred from Burra and Miss Grosser on the staff has gained her BA. [Personal interest: attending every day for 1910 were Maurice and Norman Fuss. The prize for perseverance in 5th Class went to Manville Fuss, but this seems likely to be a mistake for Maurice Fuss.]

Obituary. Mr John Morgan died 31 December 1910 aged 71. He was born in Gloucestershire in 1839 and arrived in SA in 1858 in charge of horses for the late Dr Brown. He was among the first to take up land at Baldina and one of the first to grow wheat on the east side of the ranges. Some time ago he sold most of his land and took the job of ranger, inspector and overseer of works for the Burra District Council. He was an active member of the Burra School Board of Advice. A short while ago he developed bronchitis. He leaves a family of six sons and six daughters: Walter (Ironmine), John (Yancannia Station NSW), Herbert (Redruth), William (Kooringa), George Brettle & Edwin Henry (Morganville Station [sic]), Mrs W. Byles (Redruth), Mrs D.E. Williams (Ironmine), Mrs Henry Motherall (Hanson), Mrs H.A. Byles (Old Koomooloo), Mrs W.H. McWaters (Sampson’s Well) & Mrs W. Morgan (Boulder City WA) and 42 grandchildren. [Born 6 October 1839.]

Christmas in Burra

Christmas Eve in Burra 1910 will be remembered without a doubt as one of the best. Every business did well and afternoon and evening business was exceptionally brisk. Purchasers in many instances showed that prosperous times had come along. Prominent businessmen reported record receipts. Fruit and cool drink shops did good trade and hotels were crowded. Youngsters competed to see who could make the most noise. Crowds were a record since the old mining days. Good behaviour generally prevailed and ensured one of the most pleasant Christmas Eves ever in Burra.

Thomas Sandland’s car got away from its park outside their house, Heathmont, and rolled down Limestone Hill. It came to rest among the remains of M. Hoare’s fence. The car was little damaged, but the fence suffered more.

Boxing Day Sports organised by the Burra Bicycle and Athletic Club at the Aberdeen Oval was well run and an excellent meeting. Results are printed. There was a dance in the evening.

Mr & Mrs I.J. Warnes gave a grand social and Christmas tree at Leighton Hall on 20 December when over 300 persons were entertained.

Christmas in Burra was cool.

John Pearce is making good progress in erecting the new Kooringa post office.

Earth tremors were felt around SA in December.

Aberdeen Ballast Quarry workers got only Christmas Day off as a holiday.

Hanson Methodist Church held its Anniversary on Christmas Day. Rev. T. Weatherill preached and the new Estey organ [of which details are printed] cost £72 and was opened on Christmas Day free of debt. The tea meeting on 28 December was very successful when 120 came from Burra by train with many more by other means. About £12 was raised.

Considerable sickness in Burra over Christmas period.

Miss Edith Cave arranged the usual Christmas festival at the Burra Hospital on 23 December with Christmas tree and entertainment etc.

Kooringa Methodist Church. Opening of the New Kindergarten Rooms.

For some time now the officers and teachers have been contemplating an up-to-date movement to provide greater accommodation for an increased number of scholars and to introduce new methods of instruction. Some time ago Me Lipson Hancock, Vice-President of the World’s Sunday School Union, visited and assisted in the drawing up of plans. The aid of a generous donor enabled work to be entered upon at once. Three months ago Messrs J. Pearce & Sons began the work. The new additions are of small corrugated iron and matchboard with Wunderlich ceilings. Sawdust has been used extensively as insulation in the walls. The building is at the rear and is attached to the present lecture hall. It contains Kindergarten and Primary schoolrooms, cloak rooms for lady teachers and a room for beginners. Space is provided for secretaries’ tables and work. There are two pianos, two baby organs and 100 kindergarten chairs, hygienic blackboards and adult chairs and space for parents and friends. There is an excellent supply of sand trays.

Rev. A.W. Wellington, President of the SA Conference, opened the new rooms on Sunday 1 January after a short service. Mr John Deene spoke words of explanation and appreciation. Mr John Drew as Superintendent of the Sunday school explained the vision teachers had for the new school. An appeal to the congregation for funds brought in £10, the Girls’ Church Aid raised £20 towards renovating the lecture hall and £30 towards the new building.

Burra Town Council, 4 January

A.W. Dobbie advises the plate for the rotunda will be ready in a few days.

Radford Bros. were given permission to erect private telephone poles through part of the Corporation.

Cr Hardy Moved that overtime worked by the Corporation employees be paid for and not be taken out as hitherto. Seconded by Cr Lowe and carried.

Cr Hardy moved a small gate be erected at the cemetery to allow public access at all times and the curator’s services on Sunday’s be dispensed with. Seconded Cr Parks and carried.

Local Board of Health

Cr Hardy pointed out that the scavenging of the town was very unsatisfactory and contentions had arisen over what the scavenger had to take away as per his schedule of duties. He moved a special meeting of the Board be held during the next two weeks to go into the matter and to ensure justice to both the scavenger and the ratepayers.

Cr Parks moved an amendment that no meeting be held and consideration of the matter be held over till the scavenger’s contract ran out.

Cr Hardy’s motion was carried on the casting vote of the Mayor.

The Liberal Union

Mr Thomas McWaters chaired a meeting in the Lodge Room at the Institute on Friday with a view to the formation of a branch of the Liberal Union in Burra. Mr Warren, the organiser, addressed the crowded room. He said the formation of a new group was necessary to fight socialism and the old organisations that were opposed to it, namely the Farmers & Producers Political Union, the Liberal & Democratic Union & the Australian National League, had all been fighting each other allowing the socialists to win. The three old movements had decided it was time to sink their differences. The new party aimed to create general interest in public affairs, to secure a fair representation in state and federal Parliaments, to promote sound, progressive and humanitarian legislation, to unite all persons who agreed with their objects and platform and to select and support suitable candidates. The new party did not agree with the present Government, the members of which had proved themselves incompetent. Neither did they support the Government’s taxation arrangements.

W.H. Hardy moved that a branch of the Liberal Union be founded in Burra. Seconded by W.E. Hodge and carried. J. McDonald was elected President and S.M. Lane & L. Lewis were elected Secretaries.

[The Farmers & Producers Union had represented mainly the pastoralists, the Liberal & Democratic Union supported the interests of the small wheat farmer and the Australian National League served the rural/urban establishment. The Liberal Union was formed in 1909, was later renamed the Liberal Federation, became the Liberal & Country League in 1932 and in 1976 the SA division of the Liberal Party.

Obituary. (From the Cootamundra Herald 6 January.) Mr Henry Scott of ‘Milton’ Cootamundra died on Thursday night after being a chronic sufferer. He arrived in SA when aged seven from Scotland – five years before it was created a province and eleven before it was a crown colony and nearly twenty before it gained responsible government.* He married a daughter of a fellow colonist (Elizabeth Thompson) who survives with three sons and six daughters: Murray & Percy Scott of Dirnaseer and the third son who lives in Adelaide. The daughters are Mrs Whyte & Mrs Richardson of SA and the Misses Alice, Janet, Edith & Nellie of ‘Milton’. There are five grandchildren. Mt Scott was a well-known and respected pastoralist. His station was Braefoot nine miles from Burra SA.

[* The underlined sentence is nonsense. Henry Scott was born in Scotland in 1836 and arrived in SA in 1839 with his parents according to BISA information.]

W.H. Martin, the retiring mail contractor of the Burra-Oakbank route, was farewelled at a gathering of some 30 people at Sturt Vale on Monday.

Burra Cabs. A meeting of the Town Council’s Finance Committee on Tuesday resolved that cab stands be made at Market Square and Young St Aberdeen. Fares are to be 6d per passenger from the stands to the railway station and 1/- per passenger from any locality off the stands.

Local Board of Health. Special meeting on scavenging, 10 January.

Cr Hardy said there had been bitter complaints about the unsatisfactory way in which scavenging was being carried out. He moved that the inspector be instructed to see that the work of the scavenger was carried out according to the contract he signed and that failure to do so be reported to the Board. Carried unanimously.

James H. Isaac writes complaining that good road metal is hard to break at the various quarries and tenderers are so keen to get work that they are offering prices that yield an income below the minimum Government wage. The present price of 2/3 per yard is too low and he hopes the Councillors will not accept the lowest tender.

‘One of Them’ writes concerning the Town Council’s decision to enforce section 2 of by-law 7 concerning obstruction of footpaths. They claim it is because boards placed outside business premises are a grave danger to public safety. He can’t see that, as they are only there in the full light of day. He says more serious obstructions are the verandah posts outside Cr Hardy’s office and Mrs Pressick’s shop, which people have walked into at night. Stray cattle camped on the footpaths at night are another danger with people falling over them and yet the Councillors ignore such glaring obstructions and centre their attentions on a few boards offering no obstruction at all.

‘Disgusted’ writes about the milk supply. Cr Hardy asked how many milk licences had been applied for and how many had been granted. The answer was none in each case. Why has this been allowed to slip past the Board? It is a serious and dangerous proceeding for a person to sell milk without having their premises passed by the authorities. ‘Disgusted’ goes on to echo the sentiments of ‘One of Them’ concerning the notice boards on footpaths.

Burra-Adelaide Telephone Line. The new copper wire is now nearly linked up from the city to Burra and with the opening of the new post office there will be better a telegraphic service and a telephone service.

J.M. McBride was 80 last Friday and almost the whole family was there to celebrate. He was born in Northern Ireland in 1831, the eldest son of the late Mr James McBride who held a commission in the British Army. He left home at 14 and was a seafarer till settling in SA in 1856. He arrived with 5/- in his pocket and worked himself up to being one of the most successful squatters in the district. He is the father of five sons and six daughters. He bought Broken Hill shares when they were £10 each and sold some later when they were £1,400 apiece. He presently owns Teetulpa Station of 900 square miles, carrying 50,000 sheep, as well as other valuable stations. He has been a great philanthropist, especially in later years. Although he had had severe illnesses he is in fairly good health at present. The Mayor sent a letter of best wishes.

Burra Town Council, Monday.

Notification of a Main Roads grant of £419 has been received.

F. Treloar was granted leave to erect tie-up posts opposite his house.

A new pump will be erected at the cemetery.

Cab arrangements were approved as noted above.

Burra in the Early 1850s

A recent visitor once lived in the first dwelling built in Kooringa. He expressed surprise at the pleasing improvements in the town. He said he arrived in Adelaide on Tuesday 29 July 1851 to find there was not the demand for workers they had been told existed. A great number of those who came with him went to the Victorian goldfields. The miners took houses in Adelaide for their wives and families and headed for Burra. Those who could afford it rode, but many had to walk. There were many unfamiliar sights along the way: parrots, cockatoos, trees that shed their bark rather than their leaves, trees that rotted from the inside first, trees with bark 1⁄2 to 3⁄4 inch thick. A man who could afford the £400 to £500 to take land generally did well. Of those tradesmen who started business only about one in twenty succeeded. At the Burra Mines many of the workers had been shoemakers, tailers etc. and they found the toil there very hard on them. Burra was a barren and desolate place with very little land in cultivation. Large gatherings of natives could be seen wherever water was handy. They were very quiet and did not interfere if left alone. They came to the whites for ‘tuckout’ and were glad of any discarded clothing, a little food and ‘bacca’. Miners were getting c. 30/- a week, blacksmiths 39/-, carpenters 7/- a day and shoemakers 7/6. Food was very dear, but got cheaper as time went by. Flour was 18/- a cwt and per pound beef was 2d, mutton 2d, sugar 41⁄2d, figs 6d, currants 7d, butter up to 2/-, tea 2/-, apples 1/6, pork 10d, soap 41⁄2d, soda 31⁄2d, salt 3d, tobacco 6/6 to 8/-, coffee 1/6 and eggs were up to 2/- a dozen. The town is heaven now to what it was then.

Two horses were killed instantly and one other had to be shot. Mr Opperman, who was standing on the shafts, was thrown against the fence and believed killed, but has survived and is now out of danger. He says he did not hear the train’s whistle, as he is deaf.

Farrell’s Flat postal business is to move from the railway station to Denton’s store and all telegraph business goes to Burra, which will be connected to Farrell’s Flat by telephone. This adds to the work of the already overburdened Kooringa office.

XV, 926, 8 Feb. 1911, page 3

A Revolutionary Socialist. A misguided youth who claimed this title arrived in town last week. He took a stand in Market Square on an empty case and sacrificed commonsense and a large portion of the English language in an effort to give people an idea of economics etc. His wild flights of fancy included what he wished to do or see done to capitalists, farmers, the Labor Party and in fact to all and sundry. Some of his statements were so wild that Mr W.H. Hardy (as a public man) challenged him and pointed out the illogicality of his platitudes and the fact that his wilful and uncalled for remarks were a grave mistake if he was trying to convince a respectable audience. He admitted mistakes in reference to the challenged statements, made an excuse of being tired and retired.

King Edward VII Memorial. The rotunda memorial to the late king was opened on Wednesday last, 1 February. A large crowd attended and children from the Burra, Copperhouse, St Joseph’s and Miss McMinn’s School attended. As well as Councillors and former Councillors those present included the local MPs Miller & Newland, I.J. Warnes, Chairman of Mt Bryan DC, and Thomas McWaters, Chairman of Burra DC. The former Mayor, Mr Burns, performed the ceremony. After speeches by Mr Burns, Mr McLaren (present Mayor), Mr Miller & Mr Newland, Ex-Councillor Wise gave an account of the idea leading to the erection of the memorial. Mr J.E.H. Winnall led all in three cheers for King George and the schoolchildren sang The Song of Australia. The structure cost c. £160 of which £150 had already been collected or promised. Prior to the opening the Mayor presided at a luncheon in the Burra Hotel for the MPs, Chairmen of the DCs and other members of the Corporation.

A Public Meeting at the Institute on Friday, chaired by Thomas McWaters, was largely attended to protest the new Land Tax assessment. In some cases the assessment was up by nearly 50%. Inferior country had risen along with the rest and sometimes had been assessed higher than good land. A motion was passed that all should appeal individually and John McLaren and Thomas McWaters were appointed delegates to attend a deputation to the Commissioner of Taxes this week.

Sanitation. The cesspit and water closet question will have to be addressed in Burra before long. It has proved impossible to secure a nightman and cesspits in town are filling rapidly. The health officer advocates a pan system. In any case the matter will have to be taken in hand.

Railways. Arrangements are underway to build a 1,063-mile railway from Pt Augusta to Kalgoorlie, which it is said can be done for £4,000,000. We believe it is a big mistake and 50 years ahead of its time. Far better would be to build the Oodnadatta-Pt Darwin line.

The Railway Commissioner has recommended a Saddleworth-Spalding line rather than a Riverton-Spalding line. [The latter was eventually built.]

Mushrooms are plentiful after the recent rain.

The Burra Scouts are still keen, but are in recess for want of a Scoutmaster.

Railway Timetable.

A petition complaining of the current timetable is being circulated.

[From the petition it would appear that the morning train was arriving 19 minutes later and the train to the city was leaving 22 minutes earlier, which gave some 40 minutes less time to attend to correspondence requiring an urgent response and in particular reduced the time in Burra for buyers on market days. These were three Fridays in the month and the new arrangements gave buyers only from 12.30 to 2.30. This calculation is somewhat speculative, since the paper continued to publish on page 4 the same timetable it had for months past.]

[A changed timetable is finally published on 19 July and it may be what the complaint is about, as the train from Adelaide is show to arrive 20 minutes later at 11.32 a.m. and the one to Adelaide departs 22 minutes earlier at 3.09 p.m.]

Advt. Olympic Picture Co. at the Institute tomorrow night: over 7,000 ft of film – includes all 15 rounds of the Johnson-Jeffries fight.

In the last five months there has been one case of pulmonary TB (arrived from WA), 2 cases of diphtheria, 2 of whooping cough and 1 of enteric fever. The trade premises and hotels are generally in good order. Cesspits could better be replaced by a pan system.

Booborowie Railway.

A public meeting was held at Booborowie in the large woolshed, chaired by I.J. Warnes, about a railway to the town. The meeting considered the three railways under consideration:

Riverton – Clare – Spalding

Saddleworth – Clare – Spalding

Farrell’s Flat – Booborowie – Spalding

The last named was favoured and is 30 miles instead of 50 and it could use the stock route for half the distance and South Booborowie land for the rest.

A second meeting on the same subject was held on Thursday night at Leighton Hall. Not surprisingly it too favoured the route Farrell’s Flat – Booborowie – Yakilo – Spalding.

E. Kiekebusche of Baldina says that in the past season on his property over 1,000 rabbits and 100 foxes have been destroyed. Four or five foxes are seen every day, but they seem to be doing little damage among the sheep and are rather serving to reduce rabbit numbers.

Closer Settlement

North Booborowie was purchased recently and is being surveyed now. In a few weeks it is expected the subdivided land will be gazetted.

Compulsory purchase for this purpose was considered some time ago, but in fact landowners have been offering land faster than it can be taken up. F. Maslin’s Bundaleer Estate for example of 30,000 acres cannot be considered by the Government at present on account of shortage of funds.

The Sports Syndicate. F. Treloar secretary of the syndicate reports that Mr Albert Gebhardt of Mackerode has made a gift of 23 acres to be added to the sports ground at the north end of the town, so now there is adequate land for the showgrounds and a racecourse. This is a valuable gift, seeing that the rest of the paddock sold last week for £10 an acre. Mr Gebhardt was a member of the original syndicate.

Brady Creek annual sports were held 25 February and about 500 attended. Results are printed.

Mt Bryan Estate. A portion of this subdivided estate was sold by Bagot, Shakes & Lewis at the Burra Institute on Wednesday. About 5,600 acres went in 25 blocks. Purchasers and prices are printed.

Obituary-Accident. P.L. Killicoat was found on Thursday unconscious by the roadside close to his home, with nasty head injuries. He was discovered by Ralph Hill: an employee of Mr W.T. Truscott. Mr Killicoat was conveyed to the house and the doctor sent for. He died between 8 and 9 that evening without rallying. Mr Hill found only half the swingletree was attached to Mr Killicoat’s trap. On retracing the deceased’s route he found other pieces by Mr W. Oppermann’s house at the bottom of a long hill. From the marks shown, one trace had dragged and the horse had pulled the trap with only one trace. On reaching the shallow creek the horse appears to have trodden on the hanging trace and suddenly stopped, throwing the deceased out. The horse broke free and walked slowly home.

Mr Killicoat was born in Parranwell [Perranwell] Cornwall on 18 August 1844 and came to Australia with his mother in the Malacca when aged 10. His father had come earlier in the Abberton with a shipment of mules from Monte Video. Mr Killicoat Senior purchased Abberton Park which, when he died in 1877 was one of the largest estates in the district. The deceased took over the estate on his father’s death and also held considerable land to the east. He had been a mayor of Burra and was a member of the hospital Board for 16 years. He was also President of the Show Society, a member of the Burra District Council and active in the Church of England. He married in 1874 and had 5 sons and 7 daughters. Mrs Killicoat was in Adelaide when the accident occurred.

[Philip Lander Killicoat died 14 September 1911 at Aberdeen. The place of death would more accurately be near Redruth.]

A letter of condolence was sent to Mrs Killicoat.

The Salvation Army is to be written to concerning their obstructing the road on Saturday nights.

Obituary. Frank Pearce, eldest son of John Pearce, contractor of Kooringa, was found dead yesterday morning in the old Bible Christian Church with part of his head blown away. It is believed he committed suicide between 7 & 8 a.m. having left his nearby home, seemingly to go to the Kooringa post office where the firm has the contract for renovations. When he failed to arrive there a search was made between 10.30 and 11.30 and his father found the body lying on top of a rifle. (He was a member of the Burra Defence Rifle Club.) It is assumed worry over work matters caused the rash act. He was aged 33 and leaves a wife and two small children.

Obituary. F.G. Richardson died in Adelaide last week. With his headquarters in Saddleworth, he did the bulk of the surveying in Kooringa. [Frederick George Richardson died 21 September 1911 at North Adelaide, residence College Town.]

Weather. Rain so far this year has come in light showers. Crops are doing well, but the Burra Creek has not had so little water for many years.

Burra Hotel. G. Lord is beginning the preparations for the erection of a second storey to the Burra Hotel. The parapet has been removed and building will start when materials arrive. Some 12 or 14 rooms will be provided upstairs.

Police. With M-C Kelly on leave the town has only Cpl Gibbons at Redruth and this is insufficient, especially with so many strange men in town at shearing time.

Hatpins. A man travelling on the Broken Hill express the other night received a nasty injury near his left eye from a woman’s hat pin as she adjusted her hat while sitting next to him. The pin was over a foot long.

The wool clip is coming into Burra from the outside country and sheds nearer the town will be busy in a few days. The clip is generally good.

Cricket. J.T.F. Johnson, head teacher at Burra School, made an effort on Thursday night to get a cricket Club formed in Burra, but too few turned up to do so. Another meeting in Mr Pickering’s rooms in Kooringa on Tuesday night was more successful and it was decided to form a Kooringa Cricket Club. Mr Pickering was appointed secretary.

West’s Pictures have been shown for almost a year now on Friday nights at the Institute and have done ‘very fair business’. They have decided to serve a new area, at least for a term, and the screening on 29 September will be the last ‘for some time’.

‘Police Protection’ writes taking up the theme of lack of police in the town, especially given that the policeman at Redruth is also Clerk of the Court. This inconveniently closes the court when he is called away. Police are also forced to collect various statistics and to deal with areas beyond the town. One is not enough, especially when so many strangers are about.

Football. Ramblers will celebrate their premiership with a smoke social on 3 October.

Obituary & Inquest on Frank Pearce, 20 September.

T.H. Wilkinson JP was coroner and held an inquest on the body of Frank Pearce, found shot in the Bible Christian Church at Kooringa on 19 September.

John Drew:

Identified the body, was called to the old church on 19 September where he saw the deceased lying in the northeast corner with a rifle under his legs. Sent for the doctor and the police. Last saw the deceased on 17 September when he looked haggard.

Elizabeth Jane Pearce, wife of the deceased:

Last saw him about 7 a.m. on the 19th at breakfast. Of late he had suffered from severe insomnia and had been depressed and weak. He was avoiding people. He had no known financial worries and was on good terms with his father and family. He had a rifle and had been a member of the Rifle Club for years.

John Pearce, father of the deceased:

Last saw the deceased between 4 & 5 p.m. on the 18th. He seemed dull and worried, as he had for 5 or 6 weeks. Went to see him about 8.30 a.m. yesterday at the post office and not finding him went to my workshop and then back to the post office before going to his house, on leaving which I looked into the old church and saw him lying in the corner, dead.

Gertrude Pearce, sister of the deceased:

Deceased had had trouble understanding business matters recently and seemed very worried. She generally confirmed his state of mind as the others had described.

G.E. Dane confirmed the worried state of mind of the deceased.

Dr A.R. Caw:

Deceased came to see him recently claiming he was depressed. There was nothing physically wrong. Gave him something to steady his nerves and recommended a holiday. He said he could not leave due to the contract. His worry was out of all proportion and by yesterday might have easily reached a stage of mental irresponsibility.

Dr Thomas B. Ashton gave evidence of the scene of the suicide, which was confirmed by that of Cpl F. Gibbons.

The coroner’s verdict was ‘death by shooting himself with a rifle in the ruins of the old Bible Christian Church, Kooringa on Sept. 19 1911, and that at the time he was of an unsound mind.’

The Northern Railway Commission was taken over the Farrell’s Flat-Spalding route on Thursday.

The advantages for this route were cited as:

It serves the Hill River & Spalding area as well as a line from Clare would.

It would serve the Booborowie area in addition.

It is a much shorter distance to build.

It is in better country for construction and would thus have lower running costs too.

It would open up over 10,000 acres, which with a railway could go into dairying.

The cost of the line from Farrell’s Flat to Spalding plus one from Riverton to Clare would be £25,000 less than the line from Riverton to Spalding via Clare, with the talked of extension to Booborowie.

Obituary – Inquest. At 9 o’clock Tuesday night 28 November W.J. Richards was driving Mrs Richards and two lady friends to the hospital to enquire about the health of their child. Near the hospital the car ran over a small girl, Jessie Bowen, daughter of Mr E. Bowen of Kooringa, killing her almost instantly. [Jessie May Bowen born 27 May 1906 at Kooringa.]

The inquest was held on Wednesday by J. McLaren JP.

Rev. S.J. Bloyd was at the site of the accident fixing up his own car on the side of the road. Richards, he said, was driving slowly and the lights were on and the car was on the correct side of the road. After the car had passed he saw something on the road and thought it had fallen from the car. It was the body of a child.

Mr Richards said he did not notice any bump or anything wrong.

The other children said that as the car approached one of them advised another to run across the road. Deceased fell in the middle of the road and was struck when she was getting up.

The verdict was that the child Jessie Bowen’s death had been caused accidentally and there was no blame attachable to anyone.

Isolation Block £263

Characteristics of the 1911 paper.

Page 1.

Large advertisements both local and otherwise.

Page 2.

A few notices and personal advertisements.

A mixture of small and large local advertisements including stock sales.

Some very large advertisements for International Harvester Co. motor buggies and tractors.

News mixed with small print advertisements extends usually for 1 to 11⁄2 columns.

Editorials are very rare.

Page 3.

A mixture of news and advertisements, many of which are disguised to look like news. Sometimes there is padding out with humorous items. The reporting of the Town Council is brief and uncontroversial.

Page 4.

Dominated by large advertisements.

Usually there is a column of civic information.

The political line of the paper is not very strong editorially as editorial columns rarely appear, but the general tone is anti-Labor and pro-Liberal. Liberal Union activities are very well reported and in small items an anti-Labor stance can sometimes be detected. Strikes are never justified and wages should never rise and the Liberals are the only Party that seeks to govern for all rather than for sectional or class interests. But generally matters beyond the local district’s immediate interest are not much discussed.

Numbering of issues in 1911

Volume VX which had started 12 July 1905 was presumably finally noticed to be an error and 1911 started with a reversion to Volume XV which had previously run from 7 December 1892 to 5 July 1905.

The year began with Volume XV Number 921 on 4 January 1911.

And continued to Volume XV Number 971 on 20 December 1911.

Railway Accident, Saturday afternoon.

About 11⁄2 miles south of Burra near Rabbich’s slaughterhouse the 3.09 p.m. passenger train from Burra was derailed when it ran over a bull on a level crossing. The engine plunged over a small embankment and just penetrated a wire fence. The next carriage was the post office van whose occupants were considerably knocked about. The first passenger car was stove in and crushed and how the half dozen passengers in it escaped is marvellous. The third car was slightly damaged and all three leading cars were derailed. The only person really injured was a man who leapt from the train. The engine and post office van were at right angles to the track. Repair gangs managed to open the line for the night train to get through about midnight. Work continued all day Sunday when hundreds of locals visited the site. Passengers were returned to Burra and went on in a special later. No one so far admits to owning the animal that was cut to pieces in the event.

Escape from Redruth Reformatory

Last week Naomi Paul [Paull in next issue] and Mona Goodall escaped from the reformatory. After a fruitless local search Sgt Gibbons had the news they were seen near Manoora. He went there and then on to Saddleworth where the girls were found at the home of Paul’s sister. They were brought back to Burra by the 11.30 train. Paul’s feet were badly cut and swollen and she had to be carried. Paul had escaped last November and had only been back six days when this escape was effected. While she was away she got married in the belief this would protect her.

Our Boys’ Institute Entertainment at the Institute last Wednesday drew a fair audience that appreciated the presentation.

M-C Kite of Terowie said he and M-C Kelly saw Halls the worse for liquor with his cab with the lamp out. When it was mentioned the accused lit it. Halls then said Kelly was b______ officious and struck him. A scuffle followed. Later near Dalgety’s & Co.’s Halls and Kellaway set on Kite and both kicked him when he was down. Someone came to his aid and then Kite went to the aid of Kelly who was by then under attack. Halls was got to a cell, but Kellaway ran off.

Obituary & Inquest. James Herbert Humphries died on Sunday after an accident the previous night.

On the Aberdeen Road, not far from the railway station at about 9.45 p.m. on Saturday a car driven by Mr James Herbert Humphries collided with a spring dray driven by Mr H. Parks. The car was going towards the station and the dray coming from it. Parks was well on his side of the road, but the car was not. In the collision the offside shaft of the dray penetrated the glass windscreen and struck the deceased on the chest. R. Hunt, A. Isaac and H. Parks were in the dray and were thrown heavily to the ground, but were little hurt. T.W. Wilkinson acted as coroner the next day after Humphries had died at about 1 o’clock in the Burra Hospital. Dr Steele gave evidence of the severe chest injuries sustained. Evidence indicates the deceased had been drinking, but his state of intoxication was not clearly established, though there was clearly an attempt to suggest he was less than completely sober. With the deceased in the car were James Gallagher, T. Gregg, H. Austin & W. Rule Senior.

The three on the dray all gave evidence. James Henry Gallagher’s evidence revealed they had been to the Exchange Hotel, Burra Hotel, Commercial Hotel, Kooringa Hotel and then the Bon Accord over a number of hours, including dinner [i.e. lunch] at the Bon Accord and then a drive and then tea and then to the Commercial Hotel and Court House Hotel and then the Bon Accord Hotel, Kooringa Hotel, Burra Hotel and were then going towards the Bon Accord. He said they did not go to Opie’s Hotel before noon. The accident occurred a little after Fuss’s shop. The occupants of the car all gave similar evidence to each other.

The jury said death was due to injuries resulting from the collision with the dray and attached no blame to the driver of the dray and they thought the car was travelling at moderate speed and the deceased had been confused by the approaching lights.

[Identification not certain, perhaps the Herbert James Humphries born 28 June 1876 in District of Grey, but this does not quite agree with an age of death of 34 as registered. Died 15 December 1912 at Kooringa, residence Adelaide.]

Characteristics of the 1912 paper.

Page 1.

Larger advertisements, both local and otherwise.

Page 2.

Notices and advertisements: mostly local, but there are often large advertisements by the International Harvester Co. There are the usual notices of sales and from the various local government bodies. There are no editorials. News starts on this page, but is often severely limited by the advertisements and notices.

Page 3.

News is mixed with news-like advertisements for items like aids to indigestion, for piles, for general debility and for sluggish livers.

Page 4. Large advertisements: mostly local.

There is a column of civic information.

The quality of the paper is generally so-so. The editor seemed to have waited for news to be brought to him rather than to have sought much of it out for himself. There is some padding out with jokes, but usually not very much of that.

Obituary. Mr Philip Lane JP died rather suddenly last Wednesday at his residence in Kooringa aged 79. He was an old identity in the district and was known to everyone. He arrived at Pt Adelaide by the Princess Royal in 1847 and came to Burra, where he started in business as a saddler and harness maker. During the Victorian goldrush Mr Lane travelled by the second boat to leave Pt Adelaide, but soon returned to his business. In 1874-75 he was a District Councillor and agitated for a Town Council. When this was brought about he was rewarded by being elected the first Mayor; a position he held for four years. After fifty years of successful business in the town he handed it on to his son Mr S.M. Lane JP about two years ago. He held many positions in the town over the years:

Member of the School Board of Advice for more than ten years.

By his agency the town secured the land for Victoria Park.

He was a string advocate for the establishment of the Public School.

He was also a strong supporter of the Institute, of which he was a trustee.

For many years he was the visiting JP at Redruth Gaol.

For more than forty years he was a member of the British & Foreign Bible Society – mostly as its treasurer.

He was a member of the Burra Benevolent Society from its inception.

He initiated tree planting in the town and collected the first money to make it work.

A long-time member of the Burra Agricultural Society.

He was asked several times to stand for Parliament.

Mr Lane was married for almost 50 years and is survived by his widow and a grown up family of two sons and six daughters:

Philip of Broken Hill

Stanley M. of Burra

Mrs H. Roach of Burra

Mrs A.J McBride of Burra

And Florrie, Mary, Annie and Muriel.

He was an old member of the Methodist Church and had filled every office in connection with the local church. [Born 1833, Winkleigh, Devonshire, UK: died 18 December 1912, Kooringa.]

Wheat. More wheat than ever is being produced to the west as land is cut up for farming. An increase can be expected next year too.

Mt Bryan Public School Annual Concert was held on Friday prior to Christmas. Mrs Taylor, the teacher, deserves credit for her efforts in preparing the students.

The Burra Hospital Christmas Tree was again organised by the Misses Cave of Redruth.

Christmas Festivities were a record for Burra, as with closer settlement in the district the population has increased and a large crowd assembled in the streets and indulged in a merry time. On Tuesday the shops were decorated with evergreens and artificial flowers, flags and bunting. Later in the day the youngsters added to the festivities and business was very brisk. After tea people came in on every sort of conveyance and by 8 p.m. the streets and Market Square were one mass of humanity. Hotel bars did good business, but excellent order was maintained. Gift shopping was very busy and youngsters were everywhere ‘with musical (?) toys’. The crowd dispersed as midnight approached.

Christmas Day enjoyed excellent weather. Services were held in the morning and large numbers of people went to World’s End Church in the afternoon, while others went to the tea meeting at Hanson.

The Burra Band played in the rotunda in the evening.

Boxing Day was a holiday with picnics and sports, though farmers returned to their harvesting.

Redruth Methodists had a successful picnic at Sod Hut.

Sports were held at Booborowie and at World’s End on New Year’s Day.

Kooringa Methodist Sunday School picnic is one of the oldest in the town. At one time it was held at Princess Royal, close to the woolshed, but of recent years it has been at Sod Hut on land of Mrs J.C. Sandland, largely on account of the splendid trees and the state of the road. This year’s event was as successful as ever and 8 or 9 trollies took the children. A splendid sports program was followed. Picnic parties from the town joined them.

World’s End Sports & Horse Races on 1 January were held on the south bank of the Burra Creek among trees. The results of the horse races are printed.

Edward Ernest Hardy (44), drover’s cook from NSW, was charged with indecently assaulting Florence Mabel Emma Mathews (14) of Firewood Creek, in an old mine building on Commercial Road.

Booborowie Sports were held on 1 January and were a great success. The results are printed.

Telephones. The erection of the new telephone poles is almost complete. Their convenience will soon be available.

Martin Dobrilla, who appeared in Burra last year, has just completed 124 hours of club swinging.

William Geake, a resident of over 50 years, had to have his appendix removed in an urgent operation last week and is doing as well as can be expected.

Fires.

W. March of Kooringa had a narrow escape when the roof of his house caught alight from a cooking stove at the rear of the building. Willing workers saved the building.

John Allen of Kooringa also was lucky to extinguish a burning bed on Saturday. It was started from a light children took into the room.

A small grass fire was extinguished on the premises of Mr Jones’s paint shop in Kooringa on Saturday before it could do much damage.

During the last year the committee have established a juvenile library. [Though actually they announced that at the previous AGM.] They also conducted a class in conjunction with the St John’s Ambulance Assoc. that resulted in the awarding of 5 certificates. They supported a Literary Association. The attempted winter series of lectures failed with only one being delivered. This was a very interesting talk by G.F. Dodwell on Astronomy.

The library now holds 3,816 volumes. The committee intend issuing free scholarships for young people to use the library.

Subscribers at 31 December 1912: 25 double, 89 single for a total of 114, which is an increase of 19.

Daily reading room use averages 30.

All cesspools at public buildings are to be condemned.

A new site for a rubbish depot is to be selected.

[A reference on page 2 suggests there had been an outbreak of infectious diseases with admissions to the hospital, but without saying what diseases. A report on 5 February says cases of diphtheria and typhoid had been brought in from outside the town and the above might be a reaction to that.]

Burra District High School. The new High School was opened on Monday with an enrolment of 25. Mr J.W. Statton is headmaster and Mr Johnson is headmaster of the public school.

SAR. There has been another narrow escape at the Bon Accord crossing. After previous trouble there, the railways for a time sent an employee to warn people when a train was approaching, but this has faded out. On Friday a farmer with a load of wheat barely cleared the crossing when a goods train came along. Surely a gate or even a bell could offer protection at little cost.

Local sheep continue to be widely sought. Recently L.W. Gebhardt and E. Bowman and the Koonoona Proprietors have sold selected rams and ewes to buyers in WA and Victoria.

J.M. McBride has donated £4,000 towards establishing a Chapman Alexander Bible Institute. This is but one of many philanthropic donations. It is estimated that in the last 20 years he has given away at least £3,000 p.a. ‘and he does it so unostentatiously that comparatively few people know anything of it, fewer still realise the full extent of his donations. A hundred pounds here and there, and sometimes a couple of hundred or more is quite a common matter with him.’

The Sports Syndicate. When half a dozen gentlemen secured the old polo club ground north of the railway station to make an area for sports and show purposes, the racing club discussed with them the making of a racetrack on the site, but it was found that extra land was needed. A. Gebhardt came to the rescue and offered 24 acres of his paddock at the northern end and with little expense a 1st-class track was established. Now Mr Gebhardt has donated the land to the syndicate free of cost. This is an important gift as the land is valued at upwards of £10 an acre.

A Liberal Union branch has been formed at North Booborowie.

Brady Creek Sports were held successfully on 1 February. He results are printed.

Note. Although there was no other printed announcement, this was the first issue to bear the legend ‘Printed & published by the Proprietor E.F. Marston.’ There was no editorial comment either by Davey concerning his departure or by Marston about his acquisition of the paper. The ‘Topics in General’ column which starts the news reverted to an earlier habit of omitting headings and of moving confusingly from one topic to the next unannounced. This was a practice resumed elsewhere in the paper as well. (In this issue column 7 on page 2 offers examples.)

Football. Ramblers Football Club AGM on Friday. A.D. McLaren in the chair.

In view of the Light Horse being likely to form a football club the Kooringa and Rambler Clubs would be left very weak. The chair thought it might be wise for them to combine. Mr Lackman supported this. The Kooringa club will be asked to consider this matter. On the same evening the Light Horse met at the Burra Hotel with S.M. Lane in the chair. It was decided to form a football club. Election: Hon. Sec., Mr Killicoat; Captain, L.A. Lewis; Vice-Captain, W.H. Stevenson.

Farrell’s Flat Annual Sports & Races were held on Monday last and all went well. The day ended with a concert and dance in the Institute. Results are not printed.

Football. The Kooringa Football Club AGM was held last Tuesday with George Lord in the chair. It was decided to solicit donations to write off the debt.

A combined meeting of the two clubs adopted the name of the Kooringa Football Club.

Cricket. Aberdeen on Saturday: Aberdeen 159 drew with Booborowie 5 for 118.

West Burra Copper Mine of William Blott & Son at Shafton about 3 miles west of Burra is proving to be the best discovery in the area since that of the Burra Burra Mine over 60 years ago.

Report of the Inspector of Mines.

The mine is situated on Section 118 of the Hundred of Hanson. [Since renumbered so on modern maps 116.] The recent discovery was accidental. A large quantity of stone was being carted from Mr Forrest’s cultivated field and placed on the side of the road. Mr Blott, who was employed breaking road metal, noticed copper carbonates and traced the source. Outcrops were not showing, so the land was trenched and a large lode containing malachite was found 18” down. In two of the surface workings a lode formation bears east and west with a slight angle to the south and is chiefly ferruginous calcite with malachite and copper glance from 1-4’. At one point an underlie shaft has been sunk in the lode to 30’. The formation is fairly defined and in the last 5-6’ of sinking and at the bottom the lode is 5’ wide of ferruginous calcite with a seam of malachite 3-4” wide on the hanging wall. The formation looks promising. At 26’ a drive has been started west. A better plan would be to resume sinking the shaft to prove the deposit. Present indications are highly encouraging. An analysis of samples taken is then printed.

Burra Town Council, 17 March.

Council resolved to try tar dressing of a road experimentally for a chain or two.

The Burra Band asked for the use of the Council Depot for practice on Sunday mornings. They regret the day, but can find no other.

Cr Wicklein was opposed, as there was a church right opposite.

The Mayor understood the band was practising in Victoria Park without permission and he would not care for the Council to officially sanction even that.

Cr Wicklein’s motion denying the request was passed.

Local Board of Health.

Mr Slattery of the Royal Exchange Hotel wrote that the Inspector of Hotels had ordered the removal of urinals and installation of a pan system. He had pointed out that this was not in operation in the town, but to no avail.

Cr Lane thought the pan system an abomination whether carried out in the night or the day. The Council should do all in its power to stop its use anywhere except where absolutely necessary.

Council approved the removal of the urinals.

Kooringa Post Office. Complaints about the poor lighting at the post office continue.

Obituary. Elizabeth Jane Pearce, daughter of the late Jeffrey Pearce, contractor etc. of Commercial St, died in Adelaide on 19 March aged 58. She had been born at Buckfact Lea [Perhaps Buckfastleigh?] in Devon and came to SA aged 2 in 1857 and lived in Kooringa until her death.

Kirk, Broken Hill), Mrs W. Cook (Perth) & Miss Thomas (Auburn). Also 31 grandchildren and 30 great grandchildren. [Identification not certain: possibly born Frances Reynolds. Died 25 February 1913 at Auburn aged 93.]

## The Seaside Trip to Semaphore took place on 19 March. Some 600 adults and children took part. The day was excellent and a picnic was held on the beach. People joined at Hanson, Farrell’s Flat and Manoora as well. The train departed Burra at 6.30 a.m. The Burra Coronation Band went along to enliven the day. At Semaphore rooms had been set aside by local authorities at the Institute for the use of excursionists. The train took about five hours to get to Semaphore travelling directly from Dry Creek without going into Adelaide.

George Lyons fined 10/- + 15/- costs for having no light on his vehicle.

George Lord fined 10/- + 15/- costs for owning stray horses.

Johannah Warner fined 10/- for a stray cow.

[These fines represented a change in policy. In recent times the fines had usually been 2/6, but the SM thought this was a ridiculously low figure that clearly had no deterrent effect.]

I.J. Warnes v. Morgan Bros. Warnes was seeking £20 damages for trespass.

The argument was over the right of the occupier to deny travelling stock access to a dam or dams in which he was trying to conserve water in a drought. There had been a Government dam within easy walking distance for the stock.

The evidence extends for c. 12⁄3 columns and resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff of £7-10-0 + costs. The plaintiff gave the damages, less expenses, to the Burra Hospital, having no desire to make money out of the affair.

Burra Town Council, Monday of last week.

G.R. Ridgway wrote expressing surprise at the tone of a letter from the Town Clerk threatening to regard his stock as trespass after his lease on the reserve expired in the near future. He offered to continue to lease the reserve for £1 p.a. for 1 acre of land.

Cr Walker did not see the need to threaten Mr Ridgway. He understood no harm had been done to the reserve, which was let for horses not cows.

Not a dozen horses, was the Mayor’s comment.

Cr Walker was not, however, in favour of leasing any reserves. Councillors generally were aggrieved at the use of the reserve for horses and a clothesline and refused to renew the lease. It would, they said, cost 5-6 years’ rental to restore the reserve.

The General Traffic Manager of SAR wrote to say that the Bon Accord crossing was comparatively open and trains crossed at low speed so that no electric bell or gong was justified.

The local MPs are to be approached about the matter.

Cr Lane expressed concern at the speed of motorcars in the town.

It was decided to make temporary repairs to the 24-year-old bridge at the rear of the Burra Hotel. The Overseer was of the opinion that ‘it will go down the creek most likely, the next flood’.

It was decided to place a new Grietzner lamp, like that in the Rotunda, at the Kooringa Post Office.

It was resolved to erect a retaining wall on the plantation near Lewis’s Bridge and remove a dead tree at the same site.

The Mayor said the plantation near Lewis’s Corner had not yet received an official name. [i.e. that on the corner of Kangaroo and Commercial Sts.] Several had been suggested, including McLaren’s Vale and Harris’s Pride.

Cr Walker thought that Philip Lane was worthy of remembering.

Cr Lowe agreed it would be a good way to perpetuate his memory.

It was agreed unanimously (with Cr S.M. Lane abstaining) that it be called Lane Garden, subject to the approval of the family.

Burra Town Council, Monday.

Cr Wicklein introduced the idea of lighting the town with electricity. Surely, he said, if smaller places like Crystal Brook and Jamestown could make it pay, Burra could too. The initial cost would probably be c. £5,000, maybe less. At Gawler it was £4,000, but the plant had to be doubled due to demand. He moved the clerk obtain all necessary information. The Mayor was aware of the great satisfaction expressed in Gawler.

Farrell’s Flat-Booborowie Railway. A petition for the railway from 198 residents has been presented to Booborowie District Council and they are asked to support it in presenting it to the Hon. Commissioner of Public Works. Mr Murray, Chairman of the District Council, addressed a large meeting of ratepayers in the woolshed on old Booborowie Estate, promising full support. The presentation will be made next Thursday in Adelaide.

E.A. Ridgway writes re ‘that’ parkland. He says the Mayor’s comments about parklands etc. do not fit this case. About 30 years ago the parkland in question was fenced by the Burra Corporation and handed over to my late father for 7 years. He planted all the trees and otherwise beautified it, but all he ever got was ‘abuse’. The Council have never improved it, though they have got close to £20 rent for it. Cr Lane believes the insulting letter was deserved and the Council to have been ‘scandalously abused’ in allowing horses and cattle there. I have never depastured cattle there – though three or four previous tenants of it have done so. There have been clotheslines in the park since its inception and only the ‘present ascetic Council’ has likened it to a backyard. I have one horse and a few of a friend were there briefly until I received the Council’s demand for their removal.

[I wonder if ‘aesthetic’ fits the requirements better than ‘ascetic’?]

Cricket. The season just ended was greatly helped by the formation of the Association. The premiership was decided by 2 points for a win, 1 for a draw and 2 for a forfeit. At the end of the season Ramblers with 21 led from Booborowie 20 and Hallett 19.

Salvation Army. Lt-Col. Graham had a good attendance at Slattery’s Hall on Friday 11 April and on Sunday at the Barracks. He spoke on Java and Its Millions in the afternoon.

Burra Institute Committee Meeting.

Much of the debate was over whether a lecture series was:

Desirable to ‘raise the intellectual status of the town’.

Able to attract an audience.

Would pay for itself.

Mr Nield thought that if they could pay £80 for a dance floor then £15-15-0 for three lectures was not too much.

Mr Johnson thought that the loss would be considerable.

Mr Fuss thought the lectures should be thrown open and the Institute bear the whole cost, which Mr Johnson supported.

Eventually it was decided that they would bear the cost of two lectures illustrated with lanternslides for £7-7-0, though Mr Wilkinson saw it as a dead loss.

The Secretary reported that with 121 subscribers the reading room was crowded. The President thought of throwing the reading room and the library into one.

The Institute has between £200 & £300, which Mr Wilkinson says was wanted for building extensions.

Editorial on ‘Ourselves’

For some few weeks the Burra Record has been under new management. The incoming proprietor is Mr Ernest F. Marston, late of The Leader, Numurkah, Victoria. It is usual under such circumstances to make some announcements about policy.

We believe the large important and growing district will support a larger journal than the Record as presently issued.

This will take a little time as we become better acquainted with the area, establish networks and overcome mechanical difficulties.

Our ambition is to see, in each issue, a chronicle of the week’s happenings in the district.

The local paper should represent the whole district and not any sect or section and in reporting public matters we will have neither friends nor enemies.

2nd Leader on Lighting the Town.

When Cr Wicklein brought up the question of electric lighting we were inly surprised it had not been raised earlier. Dozens of smaller towns in Australia manage it with good results. The initial cost will probably be c. £4,000 and maintenance, depreciation sinking fund and interest will all total c. £600 p.a. With over 300 houses in Kooringa alone and taking them all in would average c. £2 p.a. and though not every house would be connected, the hotels, shops and public buildings would compensate. The present lighting costs of c. £90 p.a. represent an assured revenue. In some towns the water supply is worked electrically and this could also be investigated. Electricity is undeniably more economical and superior for lighting. A generous lighting bill for electricity for a six-roomed villa in Adelaide is c. 7/- a month which compares well with kerosene at 5/- a tin. Generally electricity could be supplied cheaper than that if the Council did not have to make a profit. In addition to lighting electricity could provide for electric fans, electric irons and electric radiators.

E.J. Harris has been elected unopposed the Burra School Board of Advice. We have no doubt of his suitability, but there was an almost complete lack of publicity about the vacancy. Surely it should be advertised widely in the district.

SAR. The Bon Accord crossing has been much improved, but still has no protection. Increasing traffic has resulted from the population increase to the west and the new bridge being constructed between Burra and Copperhouse. Protection is needed.

Burra Hospital. A report on the state of the building says it is unsuitable as a hospital and the site is not ideal. The matter is to be brought to the attention of the Premier and chief Secretary who visit Burra today.

Stray dogs are a problem and someone seems intent on solving it by spreading poison bait, but unfortunately it seems valuable dogs are mostly the victims.

Note that for the first time news appears on page 1. It is only 2⁄3 column in column 6 and was certainly not a move to put major news in an eye-catching position. This week’s topic was a general article on forest conservation.

Acting Premier, Mr Butler & Chief Secretary Mr Bice visited Burra on Wednesday and the Mayor, Mr McLaren, took them to the school where the lighting problems were discussed. They then went to the Kooringa Police Station where the need for a verandah and another building was pointed out. After that they went to the Hospital where the building’s age and origin was explained. The Kooringa Ward was the main problem, having been built after the main building as a dance hall and it was in a dangerous condition, especially with respect to the ceiling and one of the walls. The Board proposes demolishing and rebuilding the ward to fit in with the W.H. Duncan Wing. They consider the rest of the building would stand for years. Mr Butler admitted that immediate alterations were necessary and thought the plan was reasonable. He will take it to Cabinet.

Burra Town Council.

Burra Burra Copper Co. writes saying they have placed the question concerning the purchase of frontages to the creek in Kooringa before their Board.

John Harvey has tendered his resignation as Overseer and Curator of the Cemetery.

A new footbridge is to be erected at the rear of the Burra Hotel.

Cr Walker moved for a fenced plantation in the triangle opposite the Royal Exchange Hotel.

Cr Lane opposed it as it was a bad corner and the enclosure would block Mr Pascoe’s business.

[Mr Pascoe owned a barbershop situated on the south side of the triangle.]

Cr Parks thought it would create a dangerous corner.

Cr Lowe said it would be no more of a block than the Rotunda in Market Square and make no more dangerous a corner.

Cr Walker said the suggestion came from those now opposed and he thought it would make a beauty spot.

Cr Lane admitted it was his idea at first, but after inspection he thought it undesirable.

The motion was lost.

A new fence will be put around the park in Aberdeen, comprising 4 wires and a top rail – 5’ in for the convenience of pedestrians.

[It is not clear what parkland is meant here, but Reed’s block was usually referred to as the Aberdeen Reserve and given the recent debate over Ridgway’s Parkland it is most likely to refer to that. This was the parkland on the west side of the creek immediately south of the Aberdeen Bridge.]

Editorial on West Burra Copper mining Co.

Is it possible to resuscitate the glory of the past mining era in Burra with the development of an adjacent lode? The indications of a rich find are there from assay results. Why let outsiders pick up the shares when anything from £1 up will buy a parcel of them? At those prices, even if it comes to nothing, no one would lose much. The money will be spent in the district.

St Mary’s. Former rector Rev. H.L. Ebbs dedicated the new reredos on Friday 23 May. It was a gift of Mrs W.P. Barker of Baldina. There are five panels finely carved in walnut by the ladies of the Cathedral Guild in Adelaide. The elaborate walnut framework reaches to the foot of the eastern window and flanking work extends across the eastern wall of the chancel. The work was executed by Messrs Boettger & Delank of Adelaide from the design of Mr Guy Makin and was put in place by Mr Delank last week.

Bowls. For some time people have had ideas of forming a bowling club in Kooringa. One site was near the Hocky Club, but that is too far from the centre of town. Cr McLaren suggests the area behind the Council Depot, which is almost level.

## Burra Musical & Dramatic Club has not been living up to its name and a meeting with Mr P. Milner (President) in the chair, has now decided to change it to simply ‘The Burra Club’ for the amusement of young men of the town. Entrance fee is to be reduced to 5/- and subs to 2/6 per quarter.

W.H. Crowder, for over six years manager for Elder, Smith & Co. has been appointed valuer for the SA Savings Bank and will leave Burra next month.

Burra Show Soc. Meeting on Friday in the Institute.

The main discussion centred on the requirements for depasturing sheep to be shown to allow them to eat anything growing in paddocks including lucerne etc. [and not just native grasses] as long as they cut their own feed with their teeth and be neither rugged nor housed. The changes were necessitated said Mr Crowder because of changed management practices now. Most breeders were now growing lucerne. The changes to be effective with the 1914 show. [A later amendment brought the new rules in for the 1913 show because, in Mr Hawke’s word: ‘as the song said, “Everybody was doing it”’.

Mr Warnes 2nd Mr Crowder’s motion.

There was discussion about allowing the sheep to feed on cut lucerne or whether this would open it up to stall feeding and the use of cake, bran and oats. T. McWaters wanted an amendment simply that the sheep be not housed or rugged. The amendment was carried.

Mr Warnes moved they ignore a protest from Balaklava about the clash of dates of the Burra & Balaklava Shows and this was carried after discussion.

G. Lord writes in support of the electric light scheme.

## XX, 1049, 2 July 1913, page 3

Electric Light. Ratepayers’ Meeting on 24 June at the Institute.

The Mayor said Burra was in a good position to install electricity with no competing gas supplies and no town debt. Gawler and Kadina, both with debt, had successfully installed it. Jamestown had borrowed £3,000 to install electricity and Angaston was to be lit as well. In Kooringa canvassers had promises for 450 lights without banks, public buildings or offices, where directors had to give consent. Council was for going ahead borrowing at 5%. He would not support paying more. A scheme for Kooringa could be got for £2,300 with another £700 to include Aberdeen, which would need another 300 lights to make it pay – or £12 a month.

The firm, Messrs Turner, Robertson & Co. would undertake to run the plant, guarantee to pay the interest, 8% depreciation and a certain profit – depreciation being on £1,300 and not on the wires and posts. He was in favour, but the Council needed sanction of ratepayers for the scheme to raise a loan. Mr Crewes said he was a novice and was present to learn the pros and cons, but was for electricity: acetylene gas was dirty and expensive.

Mr Turner said each light with lamp would cost 22/- and a 50 candlepower light would burn 2 hours for 1d and 16 candlepower 4 hours for 1d. The present estimate allowed for 60% extension, which was believed adequate. There would be a saving on street lighting of nearly £30 in Kooringa. In the unlikely event of the scheme not paying there would be a charge on the rates. Council would carry the wires 60’ from the main free and the charge would then be 1/- per yard to the consumer.

Mr Crewes thought a margin of 60% for growth was insufficient. Burra was going to grow and might have another copper mine. He also wanted North Ward included. He moved the meeting approve the installation of electric light. Mr H. Thomas 2nd.

He believed the powerhouse should be in the centre instead of at the depot down in Cemetery Flat. Mr Turner said any large plant was out of the question and uneconomic. In canvassing Aberdeen he could get a promise of 21 lights. [Though he says he was there for 11⁄2 hours of which 1 hour was wasted with hotel keepers.] If the powerhouse were not at the depot it would require land rental and another building and so cost another £1,000 and would not pay.

Mr Crewes thought if it wouldn’t stand another £60 p.a. costs then ‘it must be pretty near the rocks’.

Mr Turner said a large engine would mean a loss of at least £10 a month. It was cheaper to duplicate when needed.

Mr Dane thought the canvassing was inadequate: he hadn’t been asked and he lived next door to a Councillor and was dying for electric light.

The Mayor said the limit for the town was to borrow £4,000. More enquiries would be made and another meeting held after a thorough canvass of the town.

The motion was carried almost unanimously.

Mr Winnall was not sure that moving the Council borrow £3,500 was wise, as if passed any 20 ratepayers could demand a poll and the motion would not be binding on Council. Nevertheless, he did so move and Mr Hodge 2nd.

Mr Fuss thought it would have been better to have moved it after the town had been canvassed.

The Mayor said the Council would desire a poll be taken. The motion was passed.

Editorial on the Burra Institute. There are plans for a new members’ room. The committee has decided to get specifications for a new room and has shelved ideas for a billiard room, at least for the near future. The editor wonders whether the opposite choice might not have been better. What, he asks, does the Institute really offer the young men of the town. If the committee wants to attract young men it must supply something that will appeal to them. The Institute needs to be a club combining instruction and amusement. Once there they may be turned to other matters more profitable and elevating than billiards and such games. The Burra Club points to the need of such a place. The Institute should become a more popular resort for the younger people of the town even at the risk of incurring debt.

Fire. On Saturday last week J. Kelly loaded two bullock wagons for Oakvale and Pine Valley. Mr N. O’Brien took the first and when they reached Frank Ford’s about three miles out, Kelly saw smoke issuing from the front wagon. Woolpacks and chaff were alight. A futile attempt was made to smother the fire and then in trying to unload it a rope was cut and O’Brien fell from the top of the load onto the edge of the dray breaking two ribs. Mr Ford arrived and they got the load into his place where a hose soon extinguished the fire. About £50 damage was done. Mr W. Rule, who stopped at the incident, tied the wheels of his vehicle, but a passing car caused the horse to bolt and the vehicle was much damaged.

Burra Hospital sent a deputation to Council to lay before them the need for raising funds for the rebuilding program. Mr Thomson (Chairman of the Board) had raised with the Acting Premier, Mr R. Butler, the need for rebuilding and he had agreed, but the institution is a subsidised hospital, so funds will have to be raised which the Government will then subsidise. The Board believed the task was outside their province and ought to be undertaken by the Council in whom the property was vested. They suggested that they get plans from the Government and lay them before a public meeting at which representatives from adjacent District Councils would be present and a scheme for raising funds devised. The Mayor promised support and was glad the Government had recognised the need for redevelopment. The decision as to when a meeting be called was left to the Mayor.

The last of the properties owned by SAMA will be sold on Thursday and the plans show the Burra Creek in allotments. It is too late to bewail the short-sightedness of the Government or the supineness of the Corporation, but it is not too late for some local wealthy citizens to buy the land and hand it over to the Corporation on being repaid the purchase money. Allotments along the frontage have already been sold and in a few years it will be impossible without enormous expense to gain control of the creek. Only the Corporation should own the creek through Burra.

Cr Lowe argued for the North Ward to be included as in the long run usage would increase and he moved accordingly. Cr Walker 2nd.

Burra Institute Committee, Monday.

Mr Lester of the Theatregraph Co. wrote complaining of being kicked out of the hall on Friday nights after hiring the hall for every Friday. Mr Wilkinson said it was about three times a year and he understood special arrangements were made. Letters from Kapunda and Petersburg asserted that the Theatregraph Co. was never disturbed there. Mr Lane said there had been five such occasions this year. Mr Lane is to see Mr Lester.

E.J. Davey, Secretary of West Burra Copper Co. asked to be allowed to use the Institute as the registered office of the Company. Agreed for £10 p.a.

Mr Fuss submitted plans for the proposed new members’ room to be built on the west side in the angle of the present room: 25’ x 17’9” and 12’ high with two windows on the west side. Estimated cost is £150-£160. It was decided to call tenders.

Mr Lane was concerned that the new room would block another window in the hall with one already blocked by the lodge room. Another fire escape should be provided, more especially for the purpose of ventilation. Mr Fuss said a tremendous amount of excavating would have to be done in that case.

It was referred to the Hall Committee.

Mrs Tralaggan was the eldest daughter of Mr Sampson Montgomery. She was born at Walkerville in 1841 and moved to Upper Wakefield in 1851. The couple married at Mintaro in 1863.

They selected land at Mt Bryan in 1870 and farmed there for 40 years before retiring to Redruth. There are five children and 17 grandchildren. Mrs Tralaggan’s father is still living with them. He came out in 1838 on the Henry Porcha, as an employee of Mr Angas. He is aged 95 and has 54 grandchildren and 79 great grandchildren, the eldest of whom is 20. Mr Tralaggan’s mother lived to be almost 92. He has attended 24 Bible Christian and Methodist Conferences.

Ratepayers’ Meeting re Electric Light. Burra Institute.

The Mayor said that after the last meeting it had been promised there would be a complete canvass of the town and another meeting before a poll on the subject. The canvass resulted in 477 lights promised for East & West Wards and 174 in North Ward. The East & West Ward figures did not include public buildings or places where directors’ or a committee’s approval was needed. The expert advice was that it would not pay to extend the scheme to North Ward. Though commercially they could make the scheme work for just East & West Wards, they would have to pledge the general rate of the whole town to secure the loan. If the poll supported the scheme they would have to submit a statement of cost and then raise a loan.

Mr Fuss drew attention to the alteration in the proposed wording of the ballot paper allowing the Corporation to install the lighting in any part of the town it saw fit – giving it power to omit Aberdeen.

Mr Tietz asked if it were fair to ask North Ward to come into the guarantee and yet reap no benefit.

The East & West Ward Councillors were in favour of extending the scheme ‘when it is found to be a possible paying proposition’. The expert advice was that it required 300 lights to be economically viable in North Ward.

The Mayor said the present idea was to take the power as far as St Mary’s.

Mr Fuss, ‘It is only a right thing in a town like Burra that party feeling should be done away with and one part of the town assist another if necessary. Before long he had no doubt, the North Ward would be able to hold its own, and even now he felt sure that the scheme as a whole would pay.’

Cr Wicklein said, ‘There was no town in South Australia situated like Burra; it was so scattered, and consequently difficult to manage.’

Mr Thomas thought there should be a lighting rate and if Aberdeen were short of £50 equalise it.

The strong should help the weak.

Cr Wicklein would strongly object to a rate.

Cr Walker was opposed to leaving North Ward out – he said 430 lights in East & West Wards were said to justify spending £2,500, but an extra £750 needed 300 lights to justify it and even West Ward extended to Opie’s Hotel.

The Mayor said various places in East & West Wards would be uneconomic – like Cemetery Flat.

Mr Crewes thought the scheme should be extended to the whole town. Sacrifices would be needed to avoid cliqueism and party feeling. At present 33% of general rate expenditure went on streetlights and he doubted their moral or legal right to so use it. The health rate is in good condition so why not reduce it from 10d to 5d and have a 5d lighting rate?

Mr Winnall then effectively summed up the situation.

The Mayor picked up Mr Crewes’ point and said it was quite legal to pay for lighting using the general rate.

Electric Light Poll. Saturday 30 August.

For 141

Against 100

Informal 18

G.A. Ridgway writes re the electricity scheme. He was disappointed that the Council seemed to approach the whole question from a point of view of lighting Kooringa Streets. What was needed was a scheme to meet a policy of supplying the whole town. W.H. Hardy’s proposal at the meeting to adjourn until a definite scheme was before them had more merit than at first appeared. There is a need to think about Burra instead of Kooringa.

Burra Institute, Committee Meeting.

The committee accepted the tender of T. & C. Tiver for the masonry work for the new room for £56-10-0 and that of C. & A. Fuss for the carpentry at £66.

President (S. Lane) and Mr Winnall have seen Mr Lester of Theatregraph Pictures and arranged that from 1 September he have the hall regularly on Fridays for 12 months. Anyone wishing to have the hall on a Friday is to negotiate with him to waive his right for a consideration. Mr McLaren did not approve of this. The others however, did, as it was a paying proposition. The agreement, as Mr Nield pointed out, expired before the next run of fetes and need not be renewed if it caused trouble.

The Institute was in credit c. £300.

The issue of replacing the forms without backs was raised, but storage for forms with backs was not available and individual chairs would not last. It was resolved to get illustrations and prices for various alternatives.

Mr Nield gave notice of an application to use the Institute on Sunday evenings for services of the Kooringa Methodist Church with guarantees of no extra work would fall on the Librarian.

[This was a consequence of the Church’s rebuilding program.]

A football match will be put on in the afternoon. In the evening in the Institute 42 performers will put on a show for their own benefit. On Sunday morning there will be church and on Sunday afternoon a Grand Band Concert in Victoria Park at 4 p.m. where there will be a collection for Minda Home and to buy a convalescent chair for the hospital.

There was discussion as to who owned the creek from the Black Bridge to the bridge near the railway station. The Mayor said it was unclear.

Cr Lane moved that the Mayor and the solicitor (Mr Winnall) with the consulting engineer (From Turner & Robertson) form a deputation to lay the electric light scheme before the Minister. Carried.

South African War Memorial Service was held at the Rotunda last Sunday.

The troops, led by the Burra Coronation Band were in charge of Lieut. Killicoat & Lieut. Copley, were made up of the Australian Light Horse, Citizens Forces and Cadets and totalled in all about 70 men and officers. Several men [unnamed] who served in the war attended in the crowd. Rev. J.H. Nield, who had served as a chaplain in the war, gave an address, which is printed. Of the collection of £8-13-0 half goes to the local hospital and half to maintaining war graves in South Africa.

In the evening a service was held in Kooringa Methodist Church.

Burra Mine.

‘It is Said’ column

It is said that it has been suggested some relics of the Burra Burra Mine should be preserved by Council. The old fire engine was mentioned at the Council meeting on Monday night. The idea was not favourably received by the majority.

That the ‘statue’ of the ‘discoverer of the mine’ is mentioned is also very interesting.

[Is this perhaps a reference to ‘Johnny Green’?]

‘That some day these relics will be regarded as being of historical interest and will be valued.’

[See below for the report from the Council meeting.]

Cows continue to wander the streets, particularly on Sundays.

Burra Town Council, Monday last.

The minister of Crown Lands asks for the electric supply proposal to be in writing rather than as a deputation.

The Mayor reported that the Hon. John Lewis had bought the Burra Creek from the Black Bridge to Redruth Boundary. [Presumably from Kingston St Bridge to the southern boundary of Redruth at St Just St.]

He has asked the Council to wait on him to tell him what they want to do in the matter. It was resolved to wait on him Wednesday morning.

The Rotunda lamp has failed. It is assumed that the operation of this type of lamp is not understood. It was resolved to repair the two similar lamps.

Cr Wilkinson said it was thought the Government was making a large profit from the Waterworks. If this was true they should not be. Members of the District will be asked for receipts and expenditure figures.

Fear of the creek at the back of Vivian Lewis’s garage being obstructed was raised and the Mayor will take it up with the firm.

It seems that Mr Bewley has fenced 5-6’ of the plantation near the hospital onto the road. If so the Council fence could be carried inside.

Cr Harris said it had been suggested that the old fire engine at the Mine should be preserved as a relic of the mining days. Cr Lane agreed.

Cr Wicklein thought ‘there was no necessity to have anything to remind the people of the generosity of the Burra Mining Co.’ [Black and white print gives no certain indication of whether he was being ironic here, but it seems very likely that he was.]

Cr Parks did not see where it could be put and the matter dropped.

Mr Winnall, who was present by request, said if he was to fill up the application to the minister for permission to raise a loan he needed to know if they intended to extend the electricity scheme beyond Kooringa. Cr Wicklein said no.

Mr Winnall said in that case £2,200 should be sufficient. He also considered the estimated burning time of two hours per lamp was too long. If the estimate was correct he did not see how the scheme could pay as it only allowed £70 for wages.

Cr Wicklein said the driver would only be an improver and the plant would only be working three days a week. [This would suggest some type of battery storage system was contemplated.]

He moved a loan of £2,300 be procured. 2nd Cr Lane and carried.

Cr Parks gave notice of a motion that the resolution confining the lights to East and West Wards be rescinded.

Last Thursday Mr Mitchell SM conducted an inquest into the death of John Bull, found in front of the Bon Accord Hotel on Wednesday between 9.30 and 10 p.m. with a gaping wound in his neck.

Dr Steele had examined the deceased, having been called out to the hotel where the deceased was gasping for breath and died shortly after his arrival. The wound appeared to have been inflicted by a short bladed instrument. If he were right handed it could have been self-inflicted.

Ernest Warma, locomotive fireman, said he had seen the deceased talking to himself and pacing up and down outside the hotel about 8.30 p.m. He returned about 9.30 p.m. when the deceased was sitting on a seat. Warma went in for a drink and returned about 9.45 p.m. when the deceased was lying on the ground in a pool of blood.

John O’Brien confirmed Warma’s evidence.

Leonard John Hogan had noticed the deceased sitting and later on passing by heard the sound of liquid dropping. Two men then laid the deceased on the ground and sent for a doctor and the police.

Thomas Gregg of the Bon Accord and J.P. Turley, manager for Drew & Crewes, also gave evidence. Turley had known the deceased 20 years before at White Cliffs and to the best of his knowledge the body was that of John Bull, a native of the Hamilton District, Victoria.

M-C J.A. Skinner had found union tickets on the body in the name of J. Bull and his swag 300 yards from the hotel, but no other instrument.

[The deceased appears to have been experiencing hallucinations prior to his death.]

The verdict was death by a self-inflicted wound.

Those American Boys arrived by the midday train on Saturday and marched to the Institute with the band playing and were formally welcomed.

Saturday afternoon football:

Burra 1.5 3.12 4.15 5.21 (51)

American Boys 0.2 1.3 2.4 4.5 (29)

The evening entertainment at the Institute was crowded to the doors and was very well received, though the stage was too small to make the most of the drills.

On Sunday morning the boys could be seen all over town, with the old mine a popular place to visit and in the afternoon the band played in Victoria Park, but unfortunately it was cold and showery. The charity collection there brought in c. £7. The football match raised £8, of which one third was for the boys and two thirds for charity. The concert grossed £31. The party left for Broken Hill by Sunday evening’s express.

‘Burra Resident’ writes querying whether John Bull was supplied with liquor when already drunk and whether the person who did so was not then responsible for his death. The writer also considers that eight places for the sale of liquor in the town are too many.

The editor points out that the man appears to have been suffering from the effects of alcohol when he arrived. The landlord of the Bon Accord supplied him with water and a bowl of soup.

Burra Show was held last Friday and was very successful. Despite a pleasant start, cold intermittent showers spoiled the afternoon, but by then the crowd had come in record numbers and the gate took almost £90.

There was a fine display of dairy produce in which E.N. Finch was the most successful.

Poultry as usual was very good.

Draught horses had improved.

Cattle as usual were few.

Dogs were as good as usual and more coursing activity has resulted in over 30 greyhounds being exhibited.

Sheep numbers were down due to the dry weather, but quality was good.

Chin Young scored heavily in amateur vegetables, though it makes one wonder what constitutes ‘professional’.

E.N. Finch won the wheat prize.

Burra Town Council, Monday.

The Hydraulic Engineer advises that the capital cost of the Burra Waterworks was £10,750 and revenue for the year ending 30 June was £1,145, producing a nett return of 3.2%.

The visit of the American Boys raised £11-9-0 for charities. An invalid chair will be bought for the hospital and the balance will be sent to Minda Home.

Two boys have been seen pulling up recently planted street trees. The cost of replacement has been estimated at 10/- and the boys’ parents will be asked to pay, or legal proceedings will be taken.

The Railways Department will be asked when it is intended to place the bell at the Bon Accord crossing.

District MPs are to be asked if there is any truth in the statement that from November the Broken Hill express will not stop at Burra.

Kooringa Methodist Church celebrated the last anniversary in the present building last Sunday & Monday. Rev. Henry Howard of Pirie St, Adelaide, preached.

Ernest W. Crewes writes re early closing day. Some people favour Wednesday, as at present, others want the businesses to close at 1 p.m. Saturday and remain open till 9 p.m. on Fridays in lieu. He personally is of this view. Since other towns do this most sport is now played on Saturdays. He calls a meeting of storekeepers for Thursday at 7.30 p.m. and asks all businessmen from Aberdeen and Redruth to attend as well, to make the Saturday half-holiday general.

‘A Burra Resident’ writes stating that the late John Bell had been in town as early as Wednesday morning. The editor discounts this rumour and says police have made special enquiries and established he only arrived on the day he committed suicide, leaving some teams a mile or two outside of the town and passing straight through Kooringa to Aberdeen.

Mabel Dunstan. There is a 1⁄3-column article on this lady, who is one of half a dozen women architects in Sydney. She is the daughter of the former Mayor of Burra, John Dunstan jnr and was born in Burra. She studied with her father and now after 10 years takes charge of his office when he is away. She is left the domestic architecture, while her father concentrates on commercial buildings. She has been an architect for 10 years and arrived in Sydney about 8 years ago.

Mr Bailey arrived in Adelaide aged 9 and with his father helped to fence the Gawler railway. His father then took land at Mintaro and later at Gum Creek. Mr Bailey then bought land adjacent to his father’s and held it till he sold it upon retiring to Aberdeen about two years ago. The family are: Miss Sarah Bailey (NSW), Messrs George (Brinkworth), Alfred (Leighton), Henry (WA), James (Melbourne) and in Aberdeen the Misses Mabel & Mary and Messrs David and John.

Editorial. The Broken Hill Express.

Burra is the largest town north of Gawler and it is hard to credit ceasing to stop here for a saving of a paltry 5 minutes in a journey of 14 hours.

Many passengers for Broken Hill join in Burra.

Large interests beyond Petersburg are held by Burra residents who therefore often use the express – e.g. Messrs William, Robert, A.J. & Norman McBride, C. Bartholomaeus, L. & A. Gebhardt and the proprietors of Gum Creek, Koonoona and Manunda properties. All these own properties on the line.

Each of the stock salesmen has offices at Petersburg, Jamestown and Broken Hill and use the express frequently. All these will be greatly inconvenienced.

The mail we get by the express will of course be stopped.

On Wednesday Aberdeen Gents 11-107 defeated Kooringa 10-104.

[Presumably these are the figures corrected in the next issue.]

Aberdeen Ladies 7-44 defeated Kooringa Ladies 1-26.

Football. On Saturday the Aberdeen players went to Morgan.

[It seems probable that Morgan 8.13 defeated Aberdeen 4.5, though no one seems to have properly kept score.]

On Sunday there was a visit by motor launch to New Era before leaving for home at 2 p.m., arriving at c. 7 p.m. Travel was by motor lorry. [C.A. Fuss was part of the entourage.]

Kooringa Methodist Church Anniversary public tea meeting was held on Monday. Rev. J.H. Nield said that so far the amount promised for the new church was £993-15-9. The sale of the old Bible Christian manse raised £717-10-0 and the fete raised £154-2-8. Of the promises so far £366-18-3 had actually been paid and of the remaining £635, some £600 of it was promised by just six persons. Tenders for the new church have been called.

Rev. Burgess had been invited to conduct farewell services, but was prevented by age. Rev. W.G. Clarke has now been asked. Rev. Howard, President of Conference, would come to lay the foundation stone. He reported losses to the congregation by the removal of residents, particularly from the east of the circuit. Last Sunday at World’s End the congregation was 5 and at Douglas the other day it was 13. Baldina congregations had also declined. Everything was being concentrated upon Kooringa and the outside churches grew worse as the years went by. Mr Bailey had helped in the circuit till he went to the college. Mr Nelson had replaced him for six months, but would soon retire.

Meeting of Businessmen re Saturday Half-Holiday.

This was held at The Institute on Thursday with E.W. Crewes in the chair.

For a long time the half-holiday on Wednesday had worked well, but gradually other towns had changed to Saturday and now the Kooringa store closed on Wednesday and the Aberdeen one on Saturday. Then on Friday when there were [stock] sales the 6 p.m. closing time created an inconvenient rush. Also with most holidays being on Mondays, Saturday closing was a convenience for workers.

Mr Pederson favoured Saturdays. Mr Ridgway sent a letter lending his support to Saturday. Mr Crewes said Mt Bryan and Hallett stores now closed on Wednesday, but would fall into line with Burra. [Presumably he was speaking for Drew & Crewes’ branches.] F. Sara and Mr Hartnett also favoured Saturday. A deputation was established to go to the Mayor to convene a public meeting to discuss the matter.

Hockey. The Hockey Club held a dance to conclude the season last Wednesday.

Burra United Friendly Societies’ Demonstration & Sports was held last Wednesday.

The day was very warm and this, together with tennis at Aberdeen and the Rifle Club trip to Gawler, reduced attendance. The gate was £11-10-0.

Broken Hill Express. As a result of a meeting in the Institute on Friday a deputation will wait on the Railway Commissioner to express their great displeasure at the proposal not to have the Broken Hill express stop at Burra.

The Local Board of Health would like to see the banning of fireworks. Concern was expressed about car speeds, which are up to 28 m.p.h. It is thought that many drivers are unlicensed.

Accident. In Saturday evening the gas lamp on Park’s corner exploded at about 6.45 p.m. soon after being lit. The cause was probably due to its being dirty. No one was hurt, but the door of the lamp was driven into a tree about 14’ away to a depth of several inches and all that remained standing was the base. This is the second town lamp to explode.

Broken Hill Express. After the deputation waited on the Railway Commissioner yesterday there is a good chance of a satisfactory compromise.

Burra town Council, Monday.

The Railway Commissioner expects the Bon Accord gong to be installed this week.

Cr Wicklein moved that the footpath from Streicher’s to S. Burns’ corner Chapel St be tar paved. Carried. Cr Lowe moved the footpath from Sara’s to the Black Bridge be tar paved.

Lamplighters are asked to overhaul all lamps in view of Saturday’s explosion.

On 1 December the following officers retire from Council:

Mayor Mr McLaren

North Ward Cr Lowe

East Ward Cr Lane

West Ward Cr Wicklein

Cr Wicklein & Mr McLaren indicated they would stand again. Cr Lowe said he would not.

Nothing has been finalised about ownership of the creek. One idea was for the Council to own a chain road along the creek with openings for road access at certain points. Another idea was for Council to have absolute control to the rear of the fountain [Jubilee Fountain in The Avenue] and perpetual lease on any parts the Council might plant.

Messrs Fuss and Milner waited on Council for a reduction in the charge made for the oval for the United Friendly Societies’ Sports, which had resulted in a loss. After discussion a full refund of the £3-3-0 fee was carried.

Early Closing Meeting in the Institute Lodge Room last Thursday.

The Mayor said there would need to be a petition signed by at least 10% of electors to bring the town under the Early Closing Act. If a larger counter-petition were lodged a poll would be needed. The area of application would have to be defined. Murray Bridge for example had taken in two adjacent Hundreds.

Mr Crewes moved the adoption of the Early Closing Act for Burra and Mr Lowe 2nd.

Mr Wicklein wanted the area to include World’s End, Booborowie & Leighton.

[Selling from vans was one concern expressed.]

Mr Crewes said their vans came in on Friday and van men would enjoy the Saturday half-holiday.

Mr Wicklein then changed his motion to include the Hundreds of Ayers, Hallett, Kingston, Baldina and Kooringa. 2nd A.D. McLaren.

N. Pearce was for closure by mutual consent rather than by invoking the Act and Mr Treloar agreed.

Eventually other motions were withdrawn and a new one proposed to establish a committee to discover the wishes of the population.

Burra Town Council, Monday.

Notice from Rev. Bloyd about Hospital Sunday at St Mary’s on 7 December.

It was decided this time to issue warnings to those who let off fireworks in and near streets on 5 November and to prosecute in future.

Cr Harris said that the charge of 1/10 for a three-minute call to Adelaide was excessive. The Mayor will take the matter up with the Deputy Postmaster General.

The Mayor said the Hon. John Lewis had the right to purchase the Creek, but was prepared to waive it in Council’s favour, if they so desired. Bagot, Shakes and Lewis desired a right of way for which they were prepared to pay £3-£4 a year. The strip offered was from the [Kingston St] Bridge to the back of the Mill. At present the only public crossing was at the rear of the Burra Hotel. The price is £150 and would be more in open competition.

[Bagot, Shakes & Lewis had saleyards to the north of Paxton Square & east of the Brewery Cellars and presumably required the right of way for stock to the railway station.]

Cr Wicklein thought the offer generous and moved acceptance. Carried.

The Mayor reported that Hon. J. Lewis had purchased Paxton Square with the intention of giving it to the town for the use of indigent and deserving people who ‘did not get drunk’.

The Corporation would be the nominal owners. The Ministers of the town would have a say in deciding on tenants. No profits were to be made and the rents were to go in renovation and maintenance.

Crs Lowe and Lane moved a vote of thanks. Carried.

The Mayor had sent a £6 cheque to Minda Home, being half the proceeds of the American Boys visit.

Local Board of Health.

The matter of rubbish on the roadside at Redruth was raised. Cr Lowe said he authorised the infilling of a hole using ashes and unfortunately the load included a few tins, but no offensive matter. The hole will be filled with inoffensive matter and topped with soil.

‘Interested’ writes calling for fresh blood on the Council for 1914.

‘More Light’ writes asking for more information on the moves to get electric light for Burra.

‘Decency’ complains that groups of youths on footpaths are ‘interfering with our daughters as they pass along the public streets’.

‘Interested’ writes wondering what progress has been made in discerning the public’s views on the question of early closing.

The editor says the committee has fixed the first week in December for a meeting to review the findings.

A.C. Woollacott asks for a Municipal Court to handle breaches of the by-laws rather than continuing to use the SM.

‘Another Parent’ writes saying that if many people have lost control of their boys by the age of 14 it argues for military training. Although a teetotaller he does not agree that hoteliers are trying to ensnare our boys. If total lack of control occurs from 14 years on, this points to something badly wrong in [home] training. Perhaps the provision of alternative activities is needed. Billiards away from hotels for instance.

Burra Creek Huts. By Rev. W.F. James. [c. 3⁄4 column of Burra’s earliest years.]

Rev. James remembers the remains of several creek huts from his time in the town 1884-87. The first two huts were dug by Messrs John and Robert Collins. The huts once extended nearly two miles and over 2,000 people lived there. They were cut into clay banks about 10’ high. The roofs were pierced and stones or a barrel placed on top to form chimneys. Rooms varied from 2 or 3 to 5 and 6 and one person wrote to England that he had ‘an eight-roomed house with a river frontage.’ Large gum trees adorned the creek. Lime was freely used and some were papered and carpeted. Furnishings started out crudely, but became comfortable and even luxurious.

An account then follows of a witness to the flood of 12 May 1851.

James Blatchford’s experiences follow and Daniel Llewellyn’s. Blatchford had a hut in the cross creek near the Smelting Works. The flood of 1859 so damaged any remaining huts that very few lived there afterwards.

George Sara will turn 100 on 30 November. He was born near Mylor in Cornwall in 1813. He was a stone mason by trade and married in 1863 [sic – an error for 1836] He brought his wife and family to Australia in 1848 and settled at Willunga. George Sara & Sons erected many churches, chapels, mills, bridges and other large buildings. The firm erected a number of stations on the northern line and also the Gladstone Gaol. He was long a member of the District Council and a JP. He is the grandfather of J.G. Sara of Aberdeen.

John Reed visited his Mongolata farm last Friday and found that his manager there, Tasman Chaplin, had gone mad and was running around naked except for a belt.

‘Engineer’ writes commenting on the Mayor’s claim that ‘It would lower the dignity of the Council to take notice of anything in the Press’. This was in reference to Mr Morgan’s letter on rubbish. But last year the Engineer drew their attention to the sale of Burra Creek land and urged the Council to act to acquire some and they clearly did take notice.

H. Morgan writes citing the same quotation from the Mayor. This not only treats the writer with contempt, but the paper as a whole. The rubbish in question was not just ash, but general household rubbish. It is quite unfit to be placed near homes. Would such be tipped near the home of a Councillor or the Mayor? ‘To do such a thing would be to ‘lower the dignity’ of the municipal heads and the offender would be severely censured.

## XX, 1870, 26 Nov. 1913, page 3

Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting, Burra Institute 21 November.

Attendance was the largest for years at about 300 compared with last year’s 6.

Mayor’s Report.

The season promises to be the best for some time and both farmers and pastoralists will have had a good year. This prosperity augurs well for the town. Since the last report we have lost Philip Lane, our first Mayor and we have named one of our garden plots Lane Garden as a fitting, though insufficient, recognition.

We were able to buy the Burra Creek south of the [Kingston St] Bridge and through the influence and good services of Hon. J. Lewis MLC about 35 acres north of it to the rear of the Mill, including the plantation, or Jubilee Avenue.

The visit of the American boys was a pleasant interlude from which an invalid chair was bought for the hospital and a donation sent to Minda Home.

Electric lighting has progressed as far as permission being given for its establishment and power to raise money for it. The next step is the consent of the Commissioner of crown Lands, who has been applied to, but no reply has yet been received. If the answer is yes, then I suggest we hasten slowly, drawing on the experience of others.

The ornamental gardens, at first scoffed at by some, have since met with universal approval.

The seaside trip for children was an unqualified success and though not actually a municipal matter, it was started by the Council.

The increased lighting of the school owes much to the School Board, whose members are mostly members of Council and the Council fought successfully to retain the stopping of the Broken Hill express at Burra. The hospital is vested in the Council and a renovation is now in hand.

The general account is currently c. £47 in credit, though it will be in debit c. £20 by the year’s end.

The gong at the Bon Accord crossing has been established.

The Burra Coronation Band continues successfully.

Though details are not finalised, the Hon. J. Lewis MLC has bought Paxton Square and handed it over to Council as housing for the poor. Letting etc. is to be controlled by the Mayor of the day, a nominee of Mr Lewis and the ministers of the town. [Anglican, Methodist and Catholic.] Income is to be used in renovation without profit.

Cr Lowe retires after many terms service with my thanks for his years of attention to North Ward interests. [He served December 1907 to November 1913.]

The adoption of the report was moved by E. Crewes and 2nd Mr Fuss.

The candidates for office then took the platform.

Mr McLaren thought he had covered most of the issues in his report. The problem of Burra was that it was spread over 3,000 acres or 5 square miles and fell into two distinct parts, which made some think there was antagonism between the two parts. Indications that the central authorities wanted to take over main roads would be unfortunate, as the Council got more value for money. Cars were becoming a problem and their licence fees did not come to Council. If the electric light were a success he would see it extended to North Ward. As soon as possible he would like to see it extended as far as Fuss’s shop and Jubilee Hall, after which further extension would have to be guaranteed. But before establishing it at all more information was needed. He doubted the usefulness of a Municipal Court.

Mr Crewes said he had not intended to stand for Mayor a week ago, but had been approached by several influential men to do so and had consented. His previous service had been in the strenuous times of Federation and the Boer War. The big question now was the electric light. He had doubts about the so-called expert advice they had received. Imagine placing the running of the machinery in the hands of an apprentice at £72 p.a.! At Kadina the engineer got £275 p.a. This alone made him question the expert’s figures. The size of the plant was also questionable. Kadina was already seeking one three times the size of the one it had. If it could not extend to three wards it should be turned down altogether. He rather favoured a Municipal Court.

Cr Wicklein liked the garden plots and thought the Council had done good work in 1913 and was glad they had got the Bon Accord gong. He was for tar paving now that they had 50 barrels of tar. He favoured a new post office at Aberdeen.

Cr Lane had little to say except that he would do his best.

Mr E.J. Moore is not reported as having done more than announce his candidacy.

Jacob Richards was against lighting only part of the town and would not support the present proposal. A better one was needed.

Mr Radford said little, but agreed they needed more information before going on with an electricity scheme.

Mr W.H. Hardy thought administrative expenses were too high. More money needed to be spent in the back streets. An alteration was needed on the plate of the rotunda to give credit where credit was due. He favoured fencing the Avenue and a new rubbish depot was needed.

Leighton Strawberry Fete is reported in 3⁄4 column. Nett proceeds will be c. £60. Much of the interest was in the failure of Robertson’s lorry on the way home to Burra, which stranded about 50 and resulted in a variety of ways of getting home.

Burra Rifle Club. 7th match for the Killicoat Trophy. Aggregate points so far place H.E. Riggs on 13 ahead of R.D. Pascoe & G. Herbert both with 10. [25 points needed to win the trophy.]

John McLaren writes wondering why, some three years later, Mr Hardy wishes to change the plate on the Rotunda, when the committee that finalized the plate comprised Crs Lowe, Hardy & Lane.

John McLaren also writes defending what he said about letters to the press and the press generally. What he was really intending was to express his disfavour of airing matters in the press before the Inspector or Councillors of the ward had neglected or refused to do so at the request of the ratepayer. He also explains that, the Council having no other means of securing the creek north of the Bridge, he was behind the editorial, which Mr Morgan says secured the area for the town.

Football. The final meeting of the Association for the year failed to raise a quorum, but the year ended with a satisfactory credit balance of £19-14-4. Jack Field was awarded the medal for the most improved player in the Association. W. Kellaway won the medal for Best Man in the Association.

The wind-up meeting of the Kooringa Football Club showed they had a credit balance of £2-6-1.

Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting: Questions.

W.J. Richards asked if Councillors favoured putting manure from the roads on the racecourse instead of using it for blinding.

Mr Crewes thought townsfolk’s health would benefit from doing so.

‘When metal was recently blinded in Market Square, Mr George Lord had expressed his intention of growing cabbages in the street.’

The Mayor said using earth from the side of the road for blinding had always been done and using another source would cost money.

Mr Lott blames motorcars for the road problems.

There was a question regarding the legality of a Municipal Court.

Mr Milner asked if Councillors were in favour of erecting a town clock.

Cr Wicklein said yes, amid laughter. [He was a clockmaker.]

Messrs Wicklein, Crewes, Moore & Lane would favour a town clock if a generous benefactor would donate one. [The cost according to Cr Wicklein would be about £100.]

Mr Radford could not even support that proposition while ‘Aberdeen had not even a post office.’

[This led to an exchange about whether Aberdeen was asleep or awake and exposed the usual rift in the town.]

Mr Geake wanted to know if candidates were in favour of widening and straightening the bridge in Ayers St.

Mr Crewes favoured a new Bridge.

Cr Wicklein said Mr Grow had offered to exchange a bit of land to straighten out the road.

Mr Treloar favoured a lighting rate, as at present £100 p.a. went from the general rate and this deprived the back streets of attention.

The Mayor favoured this if rates could be kept reasonable overall.

Mr Crewes would favour it if one of the other rates could be reduced.

Radford, Wicklein & Lane were also in favour of it.

Wheat at Stations. [Presumably for the last season.]

Burra received 55,000

Hanson received 75,000

And at 31⁄4 bushels to the bag this is 422,500 bushels total for the district.

With 11⁄4 bushels reserved for seed and 25 acres of every 500 being cut for hay, then the average yield was 15 bushels per acre over a cultivated area of 33,200 acres.

Burra despatched 5,365 bales of wool.

Editorial on Holidays in Burra.

The Burra Cycling and Athletic Club has awoken from dormancy for Boxing Day Sports, which will be good for Burra. Coastal towns are favoured by summer tourists, but Tanunda does well with an ‘almost Continental gaiety’ & sports & local entertainments. Why can’t Burra do something similar?

Kooringa Methodist Church. The last services in the old church will be held on 4 January 1914 and the contract for the new one has gone to J.T. Quinn & Co. of Hamley Bridge for £2,600.

Redruth Court, 5 December.

H. Austin fined £1 + £1-16-0 costs for allowing pigs to feed on uncooked offal.

Charles Price fined 5/- for being drunk.

Edith Thompson fined 5/- for being drunk and 5/- + £1 costs + 2/- cab hire for resisting arrest.

When M-C Skinner tried to arrest her at c. 9.30 p.m. in Kingston St she lay down on the road and a cab was sent for. She said she had been to Bald’s for some supper and had had a bottle of ginger stout with her husband. Then M-C Skinner came across and interfered with them. Skinner said she at first had said she wouldn’t go and then that she would if her husband could get her hat, but the couple could not find the key to the door and Thompson had got in through a window. He then offered his wife a brown hat, but she wanted one he couldn’t find. He opened the door and the defendant rushed in. Skinner followed and then the door was locked, trapping him inside with the pair and their dog with a reputation for fierceness. The defendant was screaming and yelling and the stand-off continued to c. 10.40 when a cab passed and Skinner called to T. Halls. The defendant then got into the cab.

Archibald Thompson corroborated his wife’s version of supper, but said he had put his arm about his wife when Skinner came across and threw her off the footpath onto the road and put his foot on her chest saying, ‘I’ve got you.’ When she asked if he would allow her to get her hat, Skinner had replied ‘I’m damned if I will.’ He drew his baton and held it over his wife, saying ‘If you move I’ll drop you.’ Thompson said his wife did not throw herself down.

Archibald Thompson was also fined 5/- for hindering M-C Skinner in the execution of his duty.

Burra Town Council Elections.

There was an election in each ward and for the Mayoralty. The Mayoralty was certainly decided on the question of the electric light. Mr McLaren was for a scheme for East & West Wards only, extending to North Ward when it could be proved economical. Mr Crewes was for no scheme unless it included all wards from the start. The voting reflected these differences clearly.

Crewes McLaren

North Ward 99 29

West Ward 29 61

East Ward 61 92

182

East Ward Lane 109

Moore 44

West Ward Wicklein 58

North Ward Radford 88

Richards 41

[In his address at the declaration of the poll McLaren refers to Crewes having a severe accident a couple of days before and to an anonymous letter writer in the campaign – knowing that Crewes was absolutely above and beyond such a thing.]

McLaren was surprised by the outcome because he felt he had the Council behind him.

Mr Hardy said that although it was not the first time he had supported a vote of thanks to the returning officer, he thought it would be the last. [It was: he died in 1916 without standing again.]

Burra Institute. A report on the showing of Quo Vadis says: ‘The Committee of the Institute arranged a place for the lantern on the roof of the library, and this is a most decided improvement. All the glare from the lantern is now above the heads of the people, the noise of its working is hardly noticeable, and the danger of an accident is entirely done away with. The change makes the pictures much more enjoyable in every way and the Committee should have the thanks of every local patron of the biograph.’

Burra Town Council, Monday.

Expected to raise

The rates were set at: General 1/- £440-0-0

Park Lands 6d £220-18-0

Health 6d £220-18-0

The increase in general rate is to provide for £150 for the Creek and £40 is owing on the depot.

There are complaints from some outskirts of the town that the water supply fails in the evening. The present reservoir of 30,000 gallons and there is room to enlarge it to 130,000 gallons. The Hydraulic Engineer is to be written to. Cr Lane believed there was a sum on the estimates for this already.

Cr Radford said pressure was poor in North Ward all day.

Mr Sedgman had told the Mayor there was an intention to increase the height of the reservoir by 12’. A letter might hurry things.

Council discussed the eating arrangements at Burra School and a need for a Post Office at Aberdeen.

Obituary. Simon Roberts died on 28 November [in Hundred of Walloway aged 67.]

He arrived in SA 65 to 66 years ago in the Trafalgar and the family went farming at Mt Barker Springs. 58 years ago they moved to Auburn area farming and carting. With his brother, W.H. Roberts, Simon carted copper ore in the early days of the Burra Mine. He married the second daughter of Sampson Montgomery and farmed on the Wakefield for himself till c. 1872 and then went to Mt Bryan East. He was for a time a Councillor for the Hallett DC. He later moved north to Walloway near Peak Vale. His first wife died on 28 February 1884, leaving nine children. He later married the widow of Henry Dreyer, who survives. In 1889 he went to the Teetulpa Goldfield, but had little success. He was a staunch Methodist and a Sunday school teacher. The children are:

G. Roberts (Booborowie), Mrs J. Fisher (NSW), Miss A. Roberts (Broken Hill), Mrs A. Forrest jnr (Burra), Mrs M. Gregurkie (Broken Hill), Miss c. Roberts (Broken Hill), Mrs A.G. Miller (Yongala), Miss L. Roberts (Walloway) & Mrs A. Haynes (Orroroo). There are 27 grandchildren.

Legal advice now was that only the Corporation and the surrounding DC residents were eligible to sign. They were thus back to square one and he had heard that a counter-petition had about 500 signatures.

Mr McLaren moved that a fresh petition be started to bring the Corporation and the DC of Burra under the Act. Carried.

Communications will be made with Mt Bryan, Hallett & Farrell’s Flat to keep them informed.

He never recovered from an accident with a circular saw in June 1913. He leaves two sisters: Mrs John O’Leary (Burra) and Mrs Donnelly (Tumby Bay).

Editorial on Christmas Thoughts.

This is the usual goodwill and Christian wishes, but rather ironically for the last Christmas before the outbreak of WWI the editor writes:

‘Ideas rule the world and stronger and stronger, year by year, the conviction is growing in the minds of the people that war can be abolished, and therefore abolished it will be.’

Burra School Visiting Day

Visiting Day and prize giving was held last Thursday. The visitors were delighted with the new windows in the two principal rooms that had originally been only dimly lit be very small and high windows. The change followed persistent agitation by the School Board of Advice.

There was a fine display of fancy work.

The High School had some very good pictures on the wall.

Attendance was not as high as expected and Mr McLaren appealed to parents to send their children to High School.

The shelter sheds were found to be clean and cool – contrary to some reports.

Mr J.T.F. Johnson head teacher of the Primary School said there were 248 on the roll, 215 had been examined and 187 promoted (92 boys and 95 girls). For the first time this year the head teacher had promoted the students. Previously they had been examined and promoted by the inspector.

Mr Johnson made special reference to the work of his assistant of 3 or 4 years, Miss Bullen, who had done great work with 70-100 children under her charge.

## He made an appeal for more regular attendance, saying that children who came only 3 or 4 days a week were a drag on the progress of the whole school.

## For the High School Mr Statton said they had begun with 30 students and dropped to 28 with an average attendance of 25. As this was the first year of the school there were no public examination results to report, though 4 pupils had just sat for the Public Exhibition Exams and 1 for the Junior Public. These results were not yet to hand.

## The school had a library of c. 140 volumes, some lent by the students.

## Sports were not neglected and two football matches had been played against Riverton, resulting in one win to each school. A cricket club had been formed and the boys were very keen. The girls had engaged in basketball in winter, but as novices had not played inter-school matches yet.

## The Dux for 1913 was Harry Collins.

## Mr McLaren for the School Board gave and address as did the Mayor Mr E.W. Crewes.

## Mr Winnall explained the Institute’s donation of 14 free subscriptions to pupils and then Mrs McLaren presented the prizes. The list of prize-winners is printed.

Booborowie School Visiting Day was held on 17 December. A presentation of a beautiful leather travelling satchel and a well-fitted leather dressing-case was made to the teacher Miss Davidson in appreciation of her three years service.

J. Bailey Walker, Secretary of the Royal Alfred Aged Merchant Seamen’s Institute writes a very patriotic letter full of the greatness of the British Empire, seeking support for his institution.

‘Old Pat Carmody’ writes through Mayor Cox of Gawler acknowledging his grateful receipt of £3-7-0 from old Burra friends who had not forgotten him in his affliction through total blindness.

John McLaren writes protesting a report about Paxton Square in the paper. It had said the Mayor had asked Mr McLaren what the position of Council was in the matter and that Mr McLaren had said he didn’t know. This was wrong in fact. The Mayor had not consulted me and therefore I did not give the reply he stated I did. A man came to see me with a letter from Mr Hawkes asking about a room in the Square. I read the letter and re-addressed the envelope to E.J. Davey as Town clerk and directed the bearer to the Council Chamber. He said he had a letter for Mr Crewes, the contents of which I of course had no knowledge.

Tennis. 13 December: Kooringa 8-79 defeated Aberdeen 7-70.

Farrell’s Flat 8-67 defeated Mintaro 5-52.

The Bright-Robertstown Silver-Lead Mine has been closed down under exemption for some months. The mine requires the use of a diamond drill to continue exploration and they have been promised the first use of the Government drill that becomes available.

## Characteristics of the 1913 paper.

The paper began 1913, looking just as it had done by the end of 1912: looking a bit tired. The typeface had got larger, so there was less news and little editorial comment.

E.F. Marston took over with XV, 1034, 19 March 1913. Immediately there was more news, though general topics reverted to the annoying habit of being a continuous flow without significant breaks or headings to mark changes of topic. The masthead changed with XX, 1039, 23 April 1913 to a much plainer style, perhaps perceived as a more business-like format. This corresponded with the inexplicable volume change from XV to XX.

On 7 May there was some news on page 1 and by the end of the year this had become usual, but material was not located there because of its importance. From XV, 1036, 2 April 1913 news etc. also appears on page 4 in fluctuating amounts.

With the arrival of Marston editorials return – not every issue, but not infrequently and the whole paper is rejuvenated. Photographs appear throughout in the regular advertisements, but not in the news, apart from the sole exception of the bemedalled, but unnamed footballer of XX, 1059, 10 September 1913, page 3.

The oddities of the paper’s numbering continued with the typesetting mistake of 1060 being followed by 1861, which was then carried on from. By the year’s end page 1 had larger regular advertisements, which were mostly local, and some news or other items.

Page 2 had a few large advertisements, public notices and small advertisements and sales advertisements. There was also generally room for at least two columns of news.

Page 3 was a mixture of a few large advertisements and news items, together with advertisements in printed form to look like articles of news of general interest.

Page 4 is dominated by large advertisements that are mostly local and also carries a small amount of news and/or news-like advertising.

Numbering of issues in 1913

Volume XV which had previously run from 7 December 1892 to 5 July 1905 and which was resumed with Volume XV Number 921 on 4 January 1911 began 1913 as well, but from 23 April the volume number changed for no apparent reason to XX.

The sequence of numbers lurched from 1060 on 17 September to 1861 on 24 September.

The year began with Volume XV Number 1024 on 8 January 1913. Not number 1023 was not used.

And continued to Volume XV Number 1038 on 16 April 1913.

Then Volume XX Number 1039 23 April 1913.

To Volume XX 1060 17 September 1913.

And then leapt to Volume XX 1861 24 September 1913,

Which then continued to Volume XX Number 1874 24 December 1913.

Kooringa Methodist Church Closing Services.

Some months ago a report was ordered on the safety of the building which had served for 55 years. On the basis of this it was decided a new church was the better option. Subscriptions soon warranted proceeding with the new work.

P. Phillips of Burra won the contract to proceed with the removal of the old church and Mr Quinn of Hamley Bridge won the contract for the new building. Rev. W.G. Clarke of Unley and late of Burra conducted the closing services on 4 January 1914.

Kooringa Methodist Church: Closing Addresses on 6 January.

T.W. Wilkinson was in the chair.

T.W. Wilkinson’s address.

He had come to Burra with his parents and sister when most people there were Cornish. The church was then much as it was now, despite several alterations and additions, but he believed it could then hold c. 100 more people because the seats were then all straight-backed and could be put closer together. It was Rev. Stevenson’s time and the pulpit was very high. It was at this time that collections were instituted. There was no organ, but music of flutes, clarinets and other wind instruments, including a serpent.

Dr Brummitt’s address.

I entered this church 36 years ago next Monday, having arrived the previous day at Pt Adelaide and travelled to Burra on the afternoon train. I travelled up with a tall slender young man and we talked all the way without exchanging names. On Sunday he was the preacher, Mr Holder. That was in January 1877. Rev. G.W. Patchell was minister, but was soon succeeded by Rev. R.W. Campbell who was strong and perhaps rather stern and came to Burra from the great Moonta Revival. He had many admirers, but two of his children died here from diphtheria. Then came Rev. James Bickford, but the most striking ministry was that of the Rev. Samuel Knight who came in 1882. He was a zealous evangelist and a great and interesting preacher. His ministry led to many conversions and to the spiritual growth and uplifting of many more. Though 79 the Rev. Knight is still active in Melbourne and has recently celebrated his Golden Wedding. The Rev. George E. Rowe was Mr Knight’s colleague one year and he remained two years with Rev. S.F. Prior. He was genial, Kindly and a popular preacher, often giving special addresses to children. He has gone on to important positions in WA and Queensland. Rev. Prior’s great strength was his preaching. He took small texts and placed them under a microscope, where Rev. Rowe had taken whole epistles as texts.

In 1887 Rev. H.T. Burgess came when a reaction to Rev. Knight’s time required a renewal of the church again. His sermons were always scholarly and instructive.

Rev. R.M. Hunter came in 1890. His services were always attractive and successful and he had a strong musical voice. He always ‘put the best construction on the actions of others. He was charitable, thinking no evil and speaking none!’

Rev. R.S. Casely came in 1893; a kindly, courteous Christian who preached well.

Rev. J.Y. Simpson followed ably on until he dropped dead in my arms in Sept. 1898. (In fact four ministers died suddenly: Revs Patchell, Campbell, Casely and Simpson.)

Finally came Rev. W.G. Clarke whom you know well. I have not even named Messrs Bainger, J.C. Hill, Hodge and Hadley.

Memorable too were the visits of Rev. Dr T.B. Stephenson, founder of the Children’s Homes in London and Mark Guy Pearse. Of the lay workers I mention Father Sleep who travelled often to Canowie, Yarcowie, Muryibbar etc. and Dr J.R. Stephens.

F.W. Holder was a welcome preacher, an emergency organist, a good listener and invaluable in the Sunday school. Other tireless workers were Richard Snell, John Harris and Aleck Harris. Mr Charles Drew was ever interested and liberal and a great Sunday school teacher and class leader. T. Drew was a great conductor. There were too many Pearces to name, there must have been about fifty – William, John, & Miss Pearce. Mr Harry. Of the ladies Mrs Knight, the Casely family, Lady Holder, several Drews and Mrs W.S.H. Bruse.

Bible Christian Church in Burra. The Rev. W.F. James writes on efforts of this body in Burra. It began in 1848 with James Blatchford preaching in the open air. A church was formed with 40 members. Local preachers, James Blatchford, John Halse and John Pellew conducted services. A church to seat 200 was built. In 1850 Rev. James Rowe came from England and the church had to be enlarged to double its size. In 1859 Rev. James Way, the father of Sir Samuel Way, became pastor and witnessed one of the most dramatic revivals in SA Methodist history when 70 juveniles and 320 persons were added to the membership. A noble church to seat 600 was built and the work prospered for many years. The congregation suffered decline when the mines closed and great numbers removed to Yorke Peninsula mining towns. My own stay from 1884-87 saw the erection of a new manse.

Burra Institute, Annual Meeting

The Institute started the year in credit £251-9-5 and by December this was £186-2-7. The money had been well spent on a splendid reading room for members. Professor Henderson’s lectures had been fairly well attended, but they had hoped for better considering the expense.

Books now totalled 4,027

14 free scholarships for school children have again been given this year.

Burra Races, 17 January. This was a successful meeting in ideal weather.

The improvements at the course this year included a windmill and tank – a good well having been recently sunk and pipes laid to convey water to the course. Covered stalls have been supplied at the saddling paddock and an exercise ring laid out. We understand the grandstand is to be enlarged. The main race, The Burra Handicap, carried a purse of 100 sovereigns and was won by H.E. Press’s Flagfall ridden by Andrews.

Burra Town Council, Monday.

The Mayor reported the requisition from North Ward for better postal facilities has been forwarded to Parliament House.

Cr Lane moved that it was the wish of Council that the Mayor should be chairman of the [Burra Coronation] Band Committee. Carried.

The Australian Metal Co. will be pleased to submit specifications for an electric light plant for Burra – the cost of same being £25.

Cr Lane read from the Burra correspondent in the Kapunda Herald that Council had turned down the first electric light scheme in favour of a larger one ‘which was not to be a toy’. Such was not the case and he thought it unfair.

The mayor said ‘Certainly the scheme has not been turned down.’

Cr Walker thought that by now the Minister of Crown Lands should have said yes or no. It was resolved to ask the Minister. At present they will tell the Australian Metal Co. they are taking no steps in the matter.

Bagot, Shakes & Lewis advise the transfer of Burra Ck has been signed.

There was some discussion when it seemed that Drew & Crewes might not close for the day. Eventually Mr Crewes said he would ‘do his best to try and close’.

Obituary. Mr George Sara died 24 January 1914. He was born in 1813 at Strongate, Parish of Mylor, Cornwall. When he was 9 his parents moved to Perranwell and he was sent to mining work. Later he was taught to be a mason. He married in 1836 and came to SA 12 years later with 4 sons on the Westminster, arriving 9 July 1848. Not getting work in Adelaide he went to Willunga. Soon after he tried the Victorian gold fields, but with little success, though together with two sons he managed to get £600 worth of gold in six months. He returned to Willunga and took up contract work. He built many early structures there including the tower of the Roman Catholic Church, the old Anglican Church and the parsonage on Aldinga Rd and two Wesleyan Churches. He owned the Bangor Slate Quarries at Willunga, but abandoned them as unprofitable with a loss of £6,000. In business with his two sons they built all the railway stations from Riverton to Burra, the Burra School, the Gladstone Gaol, a hotel at Orroroo, the Aldinga Mill, the gorge Bridge at Yankalilla and the viaduct at Currency Creek. He was the grandfather of J.G. Sara of Aberdeen and leaves two sons, 24 grandchildren, 34 great-grandchildren and 2 great-great-grandchildren.

## Aberdeen Post Office

Inspector Skinner has visited and noted that the revenue at Aberdeen for 1912 was £312 and from January to September 1913 was £230. An official P.O. cannot be granted with revenue of less than £400. At that level a building would be rented and at £500 an office would be built. He thought he could remedy the closing of the office at certain hours and could arrange delivery if letters received were 100 a day. This is of course merely stating the regulations.

The Burra Automobile Club took their usual annual trip to Morgan on Friday last. 22 cars started. The usual stop was made at Mr & Mrs Pearse’s at ‘The Gums’.

West Burra Copper Mining Co. First Half-Yearly Meeting

The shaft is down to 95’ of the contracted 100’. Little ore is showing and the lode is 4’ wide. When the shaft is at 100’ we will stop sinking and drive at the 50’ level to the centre of the lode. It is believed that at 50’ level the drive will well pay for itself. After testing the drive, the inspector of mines recommends continuing the shaft. There is c. £900 in credit at present. The flotation raised £1,200. Expenditure so far has been £343. [Details of which are given.] With completion of the shaft we expect the balance in hand to be £809-1-9. G. Lord was in the chair in the absence of the chairman. Last Saturday ore was struck at the 95’ level 6-9” wide and it appears to be widening.

Utica Mine. Mr W. Allen continues hopeful of a valuable float of values found at the 100’ continue to 200’. Mr Jones, inspector of mines, thinks further exploratory work is well merited and the main shaft should go to 300’.

St Elmo Gold. Work continues.

## Burra Town Council

The Council again discussed the appointment of the Mayor as a member of the Hospital Board. The Mayor said the old board had again been gazetted without his inclusion.

[The Council felt very strongly they should be represented as the hospital is vested in the Council.]

The Mayor said the Board was believed to be about to ask the townspeople for assistance, but expected this without allowing the town representation. The mayor had also asked why the press was excluded from Board meetings.

Cr Lane moved that the Members for the District ask the Chief Secretary to make provision for the representation of the town.

Charlie was actually run over and much bruised and internal injuries were feared, but he is doing well. Henry sustained shock and a splintered fracture of the thigh. He is doing as well as can be expected.

He was interested in sport and was one of the syndicate which gave us the Aberdeen sports grounds. He was also a generous supporter of St Mary’s church and a generous, but quiet philanthropist. He was a brother of R.J. Barker of Barker Bros and of A.J. Barker (Mt Bryan) and Mrs H. Von Rieben (Payneham). He leaves a widow, four daughters (including Mrs Hooper) and one son.

Seaside Excursion last Wednesday.

Some were up by 2 a.m. to get ready. Public Bells rang at 2.30. Most people walked to the station in the keen morning air. The double-headed train comprised 10 carriages of six compartments and departed at 5 a.m. The first stop was at Manoora for water. There was a stop at Riverton for breakfast. The third stop for the Burra train was at Gawler, again for refreshments. After Dry Creek one engine was discarded, but the remaining engine had trouble in St Vincent St. The two trains carried just on 1,300 people. At Semaphore the crowd dispersed. Many took the local train to Adelaide where the Art Gallery, Museum, Botanic Gardens and particularly the picture shows were attractions. The return train left at 7 p.m. and most were asleep by Riverton. Burra was reached at 11.20 p.m. The Burra Coronation Band livened the day’s proceedings and in all it was a great success.

Burra Town Council.

Letter from the Bishop of Petersburg re a slip of land 66’ by 385’ adjacent to the Kooringa Cemetery. It belonged to the Roman Catholic Church. The writer suggested it be properly fenced and then used for Catholic burials under the control of the Council.

The Mayor had pointed out to the Bishop that it would involve a heavy expense. An estimate of cost to shift the wall is to be obtained.

Letter from Gerald B. Lincoln & J. Kenneth McDougal, consulting electrical engineers of Melbourne, offering to give detailed costs re electric lighting for a fee of 30 guineas — half refundable if the scheme went ahead.

Turner Robertson & Co. were paid £10 for preparing an electric light scheme. [There was no commitment to them beyond their use as consulting engineers.]

The Commissioner of Crown Lands has postponed gazetting the original lighting scheme at Council request. The mayor thought that it was time for a decision on it.

Cr Wicklein said the scheme at Jamestown had failed due to an insufficiently powerful engine.

The Mayor didn’t know if that was Turner & Robertson’s fault or not, but only a portion of the town was being lighted. Kadina had similar problems.

Cr Radford thought the proposal for Burra was inadequate and moved it be rejected. Cr Walker 2nd.

Cr Lane moved deferral for six months and Cr Parks 2nd. Amendment carried with Radford and Walker opposed.

5 chains of road from St Joseph’s to the National Bank to be tar-paved as an experiment.

Crs Walker & Radford then wanted 2 chains to be done from Sara & Co.’s towards Tiddy’s. [Since they thought 5 chains too much for a trial this might seem illogical, but then clearly the north end of town deserved a trial as well! The result of this motion is not reported.]

Pearce’s Building. John Pearce has a scheme for the building of up-to-date offices next to the Bank of Australasia which will supply a long-felt want. Designed by Mr Tillett of Adelaide, it will comprise two storeys. He has also erected an up-to-date workshop on the corner of Thames and Bridge streets. This two storey building has a ground floor 66’ x 60’ x 10’ and a first floor landing 60’ x 63’ x 19’. The front door opens into the shop and office with the timber room adjoining. The workroom is upstairs and is excellently lit and ventilated with 6,000 ft of superficial flooring.

Burglary. On Friday night burglars entered the premises of Drew and Crewes and also Luke Day, but met with little success. It was a clumsy and unskilled attempt. At Drew & Crewes they appear to have concentrated on desks in the office, looking for money. They then turned to the van loaded ready for a country round. Here they took about 500 cigarettes and £2 worth of tobacco. This is the third attempt in three months.

At the Aberdeen store chaff and wood is being stolen wholesale.

At Day’s the lock had been prised open. No significant money was taken. It is thought that one of the thieves fell down the open cellar door leaving his hat behind. The safety till was opened and 5/- to 6/- in coppers removed, but nothing else.

Football. The Burra Football Assoc. AGM. Only the representatives from the Kooringa Club attended. The Assoc. is in credit £19-15-4. Elections: Secretary, J. Allen; Patron, E.W. Crewes; President, L.W. Gebhardt; Treasurer, A.D. McLaren. [The Treasurer was corrected in the next issue to J. McLaren.]

Mr Truscott said the Kooringa and Light Horse teams should be combined and then with Aberdeen, Hallett, Farrell’s Flat and Terowie there would be a good association. The Corporation charged 1⁄3 of the gate, but the Aberdeen oval cost £2-2-0 for the season, so all matches would be played there which was unfair. Council will be asked for a season price.

There was on page 1 another in a series of articles called ‘Australia Limited’ which is probably a reference to a popular large book of the time which extolled Australia’s great achievements and unlimited potential, called Australia Unlimited. The writer was ‘Coralinga’ and the line was generally strongly pro-private enterprise, pro-Protestant work ethic, pro-small Government, anti-socialist, and Old Testament attitudes of ‘A tooth for a tooth, an eye for an eye, a life for a life.’ This quote being cited in the article in this issue.

Kooringa Police Court, 22 April.

James Henry Knevitt was charged with hindering police on 18 April.

P-C Horace Clyde Queale was on duty with F-C Correll outside the Burra Hotel at c. 11.15. There was a congregation of c. 50 including Knevitt, Rosewall and Halls. Rosewall was singing and ‘sidestepping’. Queale told Rosewall to go home. Knevitt stopped Rosewall’s departure and told police to leave him alone. Queale told Knevitt to stop interfering and repeated the instruction to Rosewall who went off arm-in-arm with Halls to Henderson’s corner. The three then crossed the bridge with the police following. A further altercation took place in which Knevitt remarked to Correll ‘that he couldn’t beat him (Knevitt) in a — “dinkum” go’.

James Knevitt (labourer) gave evidence that he saw Rosewall, who was pretty drunk, and was helping him home, but at Henderson’s Corner police told him to leave Rosewall alone. Halls and Rosewall then went on alone followed by the police. Shortly the police returned and told me to go home. The police followed [me] and in the lane in Paxton Square Correll said to me ‘I’ll give you fight you —.’ He came up behind and hit me on the ear and on the temple.

The bench queried the absence of Halls and Rosewall as witnesses.

M-C Queale described Knevitt as a nuisance who was always in hotels and doubted if he worked three weeks in eight. Knevitt was part of a troublesome clique.

He was fine £2 + £1 costs, or 1 month’s jail. Unable to pay by Saturday, he was escorted to jail.

Sympathy expressed for Cr Walker on his wife’s death.

Another appeal will be made to the Deputy Post Master General to get reduced telephone charges to Adelaide.

The Chief Secretary wrote re the Hospital Board. The Board had 11 members and he had no power to admit more. The only way to admit the Mayor would be to drop an existing member. The Board had been asked to change its rules, but at present nothing had been done.

[The problem was that the previous Mayor, Mr McLaren, was still sitting on the Board, though correspondence in 1912 seemed to indicate that the Governor had appointed him for one year c. March 1912. Mr McLaren took the view that he was appointed personally, not as Mayor, whereas the Council was of the opinion that he had been appointed as the Council’s representative and should therefore have resigned on leaving Council. The fact that he had lost the election to Mr Crewes at the end of 1913 might have influenced his decision to stay on.]

Further correspondence with the Chief Secretary was initiated.

Cr Radford referred to an old shaft at the back of Fuss’s which had only a low fence to protect children. The owners’ to be told to fence it or otherwise attend to the danger. The owners were Sincock & Burchell of Moonta and the shaft was about 80’ deep. The Council had fenced it on their behalf about 4 years ago, but last year Mr Woollacott had driven over the place and knocked the fence down.

Father O’Halloran is communicating with the Bishop re handing over a certain piece of ground in exchange for setting aside a certain portion of the cemetery for Catholic adherents.

Burra Town Council, 18 May.

Town lamps have all been cleaned except for one in Chapel St for which the lighter needed instructions.

The Hydraulic Engineer reported that the water from the old well is very little different from the well in present use and charges could not be reduced as pimping expenses were heavy.

The mayor thought the charges were very high. The Town Clerk is to get information from other places.

Sincock and Burchell say the land with the dangerous shaft was in the auctioneer’s hands for sale. Council will fence it and charge the owners.

Council is prepared to set aside the SE portion of the cemetery for Catholic use – an area large enough for 300 burials, but could not see its way clear to fence it in. The Bishop will be so advised.

As there has been no move on the verandah posts the Council will give a fortnight’s notice before doing the work itself and charging the owners.

The town pump is to be put in repair.

Sincock and Burchell are to be given 7 days’ notice that the old shaft is to be covered and fenced.

Burra Town Council

Bagot, Shakes and Lewis have undertaken to attend to the dangerous verandah posts.

The Deputy Post Master General says an extra light has been installed at the Kooringa post office. Electric or coal gas light would be installed if available, but they would not entertain the idea of acetylene gas lighting.

The Hospital Board is to consider the matter of the Mayor’s membership of the Board at its next meeting.

The deputation of the Town Council to the Chief Secretary re the Mayor’s seat on the hospital board is reported in over 1⁄2 column of detail:

Councillors are trustees of the institution, but are not represented on the board.

This being pointed out in 1912, the Chief Secretary appointed the then Mayor, Mr McLaren to the Board.

When terms expired the same Board members were reappointed, but now Mr McLaren was no longer on Council.

Mr Crewes thought the Council should be represented and the Board should include businessmen (those who had a stake in the town) and at present there was only one such.

The Chief Secretary said the ex-Mayor had not been appointed as a member of council and was reappointed on the same basis – as a representative, but not ex-officio. He had suggested rule changes to the Board to make the Mayor an ex-officio member, but it could only be a suggestion. The Board was wrong to say it had no power to suggest new rules – they were being invited to do so. If nothing was done he would in the coming session introduce an amendment to the Hospital Act providing for the Mayor of every municipality, in which a public hospital was situated, to be an ex-officio member of the Board. He would not now force the matter.

Leighton Hall was re-opened on 8 July after its remodelling. There was a good attendance despite the cold wind and showers. The side wall was shifted out 10’ to give a width equal to the Burra Institute. The building is ceiled with Wunderlich material. At the rear is a well-lighted stage and behind that is a supper room. The lighting is by petrol-air gas. The opening was by the Chief Secretary, the Hon. J.G. Bice, who was accompanied by the Hon. L. O’Loughlin MP. They were welcomed by the hall’s Vice-President, A.D. McDonald as the President, I.J. Warnes, was ill. The hall was opened in November 1909 and cost £400. That debt had been paid off. Closer settlement had called for a larger hall. The hall had been a great boon as a social centre. There was a dramatic club and a ladies guild.

The additions had cost £380, but Mr McDonald was sure it would soon be paid off. After Mr Bice had opened the hall afternoon tea was served. The contractor was Mr Marsh. A concert followed, including the farce The Wrong Box.

Letter from ‘Square Dinkum’ of Hallett re the Burra Football Association and umpires. [A lengthy, but clear and interestingly written letter.]

The Association calls for applications for umpires at so much per match, home and away.

All umpires declare their services are available.

When one shows his discontent he is fired instead of being told to fulfil his contract.

Having dismissed one umpire for favouring a home team, they then have but one left for two matches at the same time.

They then appoint a Terowie man to umpire a Terowie game.

The Hallett team leaves at half time on account of disgraceful favouritism.

Because the protest from the Hallett Captain does not comply with the exact letter of the rules it is dismissed as informal: witnesses were bundled out and the match awarded to Terowie.

One umpire was dismissed for favouritism and the other given their eternal blessing for the very same offence.

Hallett delegates must get the lid off and let in a little pure air.

Editorial on the OUTBREAK OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR

The cause is said to be Austria’s desire for a deep-sea port on the Black Sea as her Adriatic coast was too shallow. Russia could not allow that as it would lead to Austria disputing with her possession of the Black Sea. The Balkan States are allied to Russia. Germany has formed the Triple Alliance with Austria and Italy while Russia France and England form the Triple Entente. Everything points to a huge war and that is now inevitable. Australia will be affected in various ways. If the Motherland needs the assistance of Australia that will be gladly given. The Australian Government has offered its fleet and 20,000 men in the event of war.

Flags are flying and numbers of people are wearing red white and blue ribbons. As of 1 a.m. on 5 August war has not been confirmed.

[Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia 28 July, Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August and against France on 3 August, Britain declared war on Germany on 4 August, Austria-Hungary declared was against Russia on 6 August and Britain and France declared was against Austria-Hungary on 12 August.]

None are preserved with the hard copies or on microfilm and it is not clear how many of these ‘extras’ were printed, but the issue for the first Saturday of the war is specifically referred to.

This was a very sensible and calming column urging understanding for Australians of German origin and/or German descent, now that war had broken out.

‘Let us . . . treat our German fellow citizens with chivalrous consideration. Let us not by taunt, word or insinuation wound susceptibilities which at this time are very sensitive. We shall then deepen and enrich their devotion to our country, and our kindly feeling will react upon our own national character as well.’

Kooringa Court, 3 August.

Thomas Rosewall was fined 10/- for being drunk, 20/- for indecent language, and 40/- for assaulting M-C Queale, plus costs of 45/- and a medical fee of 15/-.

It was two years since his last charge and he couldn’t remember any of the incidents. He pleaded guilty and promised if he was given the chance he would not drink again. M-C Queale said the defendant had been drunk for a week and had 14 previous convictions. [All for alcohol related offences similar to the above.] The total payable was £6-10-0 or two months jail. The fines were paid.

Kooringa Methodist Church Japanese Fair on 7 August was a great success. Lady Holder opened the fair at 11 a.m. but gave her speech at 3 p.m. when the attendance was larger. She had just returned home from a trip to America. She had come to Burra with her parents when nine months old and people lived in huts along the creek. She remembered the opening of the Methodist Church and became a school teacher at 13 with a class of 60. At 16 she was converted in the vestry at the back of the old church. She remembered a very large bazaar held in Rev. Lloyd’s time. She met her husband when she was 20. She hoped the war would be brief with few lives sacrificed.

The takings were £167-0-11.

Burra Town Council, 17 August.

New rules for the Burra hospital have been approved by the Governor:

‘The management of the Institution shall be vested in a Board of not more than twelve members, appointed by the Government, one of whom shall be the Mayor of Burra (ex officio). The Board to elect its own officers,’ and E.W. Crewes JP was appointed a member of the Board.

The mayor suggested a meeting be called to start a patriotic fund. Cr Lane then moved to hold such a meeting to establish the ‘Burra Town and District Patriotic Fund’. The meeting will be held 24 August in the Institute.

A new flagpole and flags are to be acquired.

To start the Patriotic Fund the Councillors, Town Clerk and Inspector donated between them £12-1-6.

Leighton Hall Annual Dinner on 5 August was largely attended. The report of this dinner reveals [as nothing else in the paper does] that confirmation of the war was received on 5 August and that it resulted in a hurriedly arranged meeting in Market Square where the National Anthem was sung and three cheers raised for the king and the British Army and Navy. The crowd then gave three cheers for the Mayor. At the dinner ‘Rule Britannia’ was sung after three cheers for the British Empire.

The Hall debt stood at £350 after the extensions.

Burra Institute, meeting of 10 August.

The question of another fire escape door was held over to the next meeting. First aid classes are to be revived.

After the National anthem the Mayor delivered a stirring patriotic speech.

Money had already begun to be collected for the Patriotic Fund.

On Tuesday Mrs Crewes was calling a meeting to establish a branch of the Red Cross Society.

There would be finance, musical and sports committees. The finance committee would distribute the funds raised.

1⁄3 would go to the Prince of Wales’ Fund.

2⁄3 would be distributed locally as needed.

The Institute Committee was organising a monster performance of the choral and orchestral classes soon with over 100 performers.

Slips were distributed and provision made to enable either a lump sum payment of contributions over time.

N.J. Tiddy sang The British Lion.

Mr Winnall moved an expression of loyalty to King and Empire which Rev. J.C. Jennison 2nd.

W.G. Hawkes spoke in support as did Rev. Father Kett and it was carried by acclaim.

The Song of Australia and Rule Britannia followed.

Rev. J.H. Bloyd gave a patriotic speech and Mr Crewes announced the collection and promises amounted to £111-10-6 and so with about £30 in hand the fund would start of with about £140.

Mr McLaren moved the setting up of the committees: 2nd C.A. Fuss.

[The committee members are named and the report continues on page 3.]

La Marseillaise was sung before Rev. J.H. Nield gave a final brief address which was followed by the National Anthem. Donations are then listed.

Burra Red Cross Branch. 40-50 ladies assembled on Tuesday to form the Burra Sub-Branch of the Red Cross Society. The Mayor presided. They will make garments for men in the field: Flannel shirts, flannel pyjamas, flannel nightingales*, woollen socks, woollen balaclava helmets, coloured handkerchiefs and surgical bandages.

[*A form of scarf with sleeves for use of those confined to bed.]

Elections: President, Mrs E.W. Crewes; Secretary and Treasurer, Mrs Sangster; Assistant Secretary, Miss Sandland.

Fancy dress Carnival & Football Match last Wednesday.

This was to raise money for the Glover family whose breadwinner was rendered incapable by tuberculosis. A concert and fancy dress carnival and football match raised £32-5-3. Sports followed the fancy dress parade for which the Mayor and C.A. Fuss acted as judges.

The Liberal Union was addressed by the Hon. R.W. Foster and Messrs G. Fowler, Stewart and G.F. Jenkins at the Institute on Tuesday 18 August on Federal Politics.

Burra Contingent & the Patriotic Fund

The boys will return on Thursday on their final leave and depart again on Saturday.

A meeting of the Patriotic Fund decided on an hour’s farewell at the Institute from 7 to 8 p.m. Friday, without refreshments as the boys will want to spend the time with friends and family and in any case the hall had to be set up for the following day’s election. The band offered its services.

[C.A. Fuss, among others, added to the sports committee.]

Mr Winnall moved that the meeting recommend to finance committee that 2⁄3 of the fund be sent away and 1⁄3 be retained (instead of the other way round). There was some dissention. The report does not make the outcome clear, but probably it was left for decision at a more general public meeting

XXI, 1909, 2 Sep. 1914, page 2

There will be a memorial service for South African Fallen Soldiers on 13 September.

The Seaside Trip Committee is to meet and a donation of c. £20 to the Patriotic Fund will be recommended.

Mr Clark would support that ‘if there were no corkscrew attached.’

A penny fund will be established to involve the children.

The fund, including promises, stands at >£160.

Kooringa Methodist collection on Sunday for the Patriotic Fund raised £18-16-0. [Which is in addition to the £160 above.]

£3-13-0. Elected were Patron, W.G. Hawkes; President, R.J. McBride; Secretary & Treasurer, L. Neagle; Captain, W.H. Stevenson; Vice-Captain, F.T. Harcus.

Labor Candidates speak at Burra. Last Thursday at the Institute Ex-Senator Senior and Mr Jackson MP addressed electors with Mr Crewes presiding. [12⁄3 columns of detail.]

Burra Show Society committee meeting last Friday to decide whether to hold the show in view of both the drought and the war. John Melrose (by letter), T. McWaters, F. Duldig, J.E.H. Winnall and A.G. Gebhardt were for postponing on both economic and patriotic grounds. A.D. McDonald thought it might still be re-organised as a Patriotic Fund event. Winnall thought it would be a financial loss. I.J. Warnes then came in and took over the chair from Thomas Sandland, apologising for being late. He thought the catalogue should have been printed and he supported the show being run on patriotic lines. This got support from Mr Bailey and F.G, Scholz. J.Q. Hogan opposed it – he had never seen the country worse than at present. A.G. Gebhardt agreed with that: at least for the country around Burra. Thomas McWaters moved the show be postponed. F. Duldig 2nd. A.D. McDonald amended that certificates be awarded instead of prizes, no Government subsidy be applied for, and proceeds go to the Patriotic Fund. A.E. McWaters 2nd. The amendment was lost and the motion carried. £10 to be donated to the Patriotic Fund.

Burra Contingent Farewell.

Those most closely connected with the Light Horse decided on a dinner for the men and their friends before the public meeting. This was provided in the Skating Rink and c. 100 were present. E.W. Crewes presided at about an hour’s notice and made a suitable speech. Hon. J. Lewis MLC was present (though he did not now live in Burra, he had done so for many years) and he made a speech which included an appeal for understanding and support for Australians of German background. Other speeches were made by Rev. J.H. Nield, Lieut. Lewis, Lieut. Copley and Mr E. Cock.

The public meeting saw the hall and platform very crowded. Mr Crewes spoke again and Rev. J.H. Nield gave the valedictory address as a Boer War veteran. The Hon. J. Lewis presented the men with a New Testament and a jack-knife and SM Kenyon with a revolver. Lieut. Lewis responded.

Burra Town Council

Sympathy extended to Cr Lane on his bereavement.

Cr Parks drew attention to land owned by J. Griffiths on the way to the underway of the railway line, Redruth. [Aberdeen?] If fenced it would interfere with the road. He was prepared to sell it for a small sum to Council and it would be better to buy it than make a new road. The Overseer said he would have to measure it. It ran in a line with Mr Reed’s property and West Tce. Overseer to measure and Council to inspect.

Letter from E.W. Crewes re Glover Family Relief Fund. After paying all Aberdeen liabilities the Aberdeen people had in reserve £12-15-1. After paying all Kooringa liabilities the Kooringa people had in reserve £18-13-5. Consequently £31-8-6 was handed over to Mr & Mrs Glover on Friday last.

Burra Citizens’ Militia Force

E.W. Crewes addressed the meeting last Wednesday night with patriotic fervour.

Cr Lane moved a company be formed and G. Lawn 2nd. Lieut. Copley moved the name be the Burra Citizens’ Militia Force. A.D. McLaren 2nd.

Lieut. Copley said that as matters proceeded it would be necessary to approach the State Commandant for various things e.g. the Drill Hall, which was nearing completion. This would be very useful for night parades and lectures.

Captain Lord asked if members of the Rifle Club would be able to join – they already being a body of reserves. Lieut. Copley thought both they and members of the Light Horse could do so.

Lieut. Killicoat said there were very few of the Light Horse left in Burra now, but those had decided to help this movement in any way they could.

The committee would need to clarify the company’s status.

SM Morell said instructors would be a major problem.

A committee was elected and names taken.

Burra Cycling and Athletic Club

A meeting was held in Mr Carpenter’s room, Aberdeen. Mr Turley took the chair. He thought it would be well not to hold a sports meeting on Boxing Day this year as the Patriotic Fund would absorb all the available money. They had in hand about £34. The sports were then postponed due to the drought and the war. Mr Mazzoral moved they donate £5 to the Patriotic sports (with more if called upon). Carried. Mr Mazzoral was voted £5 for his work as secretary.

Mr F. Wheatley was farewelled for the front on Wednesday evening at very short notice. A farewell dinner was given in the Institute where the Mayor presided over about 50 guests. Mr Crewes made a speech about Fred Wheatley who he had known all his life. He produced a very patriotic outpouring. Captain Lord wished him well from the Rifle Club. A.D. McLaren spoke on behalf of the Burra Band. Mr Wheatley had worked very hard to establish the band, being its unpaid conductor for some considerable time during which, in three years, 40 persons passes through it and only 12 or 13 remained constant. He presented Mr Wheatley with a pipe and tobacco pouch.

Bro. E.J. Harris the Worshipful Master of the Kooringa Lodge, farewelled him on behalf of the Masons and presented him with a safety razor. He was supported by Bro. Dane, Past Master. Rev. J.H. Nield spoke and so did S.M. Lane with whom Mr Wheatley had been in business for 20 years. Mr Crewes presented him with a jack-knife.

Mr Wheatley responded.

Redruth Court 12 September.

Thomas Halls was charged with using indecent language.

The charge arose out of a fight between Thomas Rosewall and Copeland. Copeland accused Rosewall of coming around to his house while he was away. George Lines was also present. The fight and the offence took place at Bagot, Shakes & Lewis’s sale yards. The evidence report employs a great many —’s. Halls promised to sign the pledge if treated leniently, saying it was his first offence since a 1912 assault. He was fined £5 or two months in jail.

Thomas Rosewall faced the same charge, but was ejected from court as he was apparently drunk.

George Lines was also charged and seems to have changed his plea from not guilty to guilty in mid-stream.

Samuel Copeland was called but failed to appear.

The report then rather oddly says Halls and Copeland were each fined £2 or 14 days with £3-2-0 costs and Rosewall £5 or 1 month with £1-15-0 costs.

[Perhaps there was a second charge for Halls in this somewhere.]

Letter from R.J. Woollacott, dated 17 August 1914.

[R.J. Woollacott was a son of T.H. Woollacott of Aberdeen and he had been in England as an electrical engineer when war broke out. In this letter he says he is planning to return, but he soon decided to join up.]

He had spent the week war was declared in Scotland. Already preparations were evident with guards on the Forth Bridge etc. and on every pier. The harbours were mined. Great Britain was an armed camp with the railways under military control. There was an air of suppressed excitement with everyone still going about their usual business. Some big firms were paying the full wages of men who had gone to the front if they were married and half pay for those who were single. At Siemens [where Woollacott was working] the works manager had joined the German Navy and some of the leading technical men had gone to fight for Germany, and many of the men had gone to do the same for England. The firm was paying the wages of all alike. He says he intends to return home about the end of October or the beginning of November.

Just before going home Luke Day decided to take some things inside and he found fire in a room in which linoleum and matting had been stored. Embers from the original fire seem to have blown under the door and ignited packing straw. Some £20-£30 damage was done.

The Pascoe Collection. There is an important 11⁄2 column article describing R.D. Pascoe’s collection of sheep photographs. It outlines the reasons for the collection, the displaying of them and most importantly it describes the photographs:

SOUTH AUSTRALIAN STUD MERINOS: Mr R.D. PASCOE’S GALLERY

Too much praise cannot be given to the robust type of Merino sheep based on the high open land contiguous to the railway line from Manoora and extending northwards to near Terowie. Sheep from the Burra District are especially noteworthy. Bred as they are, under perfectly natural conditions, neither housed, rugged, nor fed on prepared fodders and sustained only by the indigenous grasses. Thus they are essentially adapted to arid pastoral country. The districts comprised in the area mentioned supply the bulk of the Merino stud rams for Queensland and Western Australia as well as many parts of New South Wales. The African stockowners are large buyers of both stud ewes and rams, and have expressed surprise that South Australia is so generous as to allow them to select from the State’s best Merinos for export to Africa, whilst Africa in return will not reciprocate in the ostrich trade by even an egg. At the present time the question is being debated whether the supremacy of the South Australian Merino can be maintained in the smaller areas (now devoted to pastoral pursuits) since the cutting up of Booborowie, North Booborowie, Gum Creek, Hill River and Bungaree, districts previously noted for ram breeding and now cut into smaller areas and devoted to wheat growing. These districts surrounding the historic town of Burra have for many years been known as ‘the home of the typical Merino’ and with the object of displaying to the many visitors, stockbreeders, and the general public the class of sheep bred on the various stations, Mr R.D. Pascoe, an enterprising and highly respected resident of Kooringa has during the past four years secured the framed photographs of no fewer than 129 different stud sheep. These he has tastefully arranged and hung in his spacious and splendidly lighted hairdressing saloon situated in Commercial St, therein securing a decoration of which he has every reason to feel proud. The collection of pictures has been inspected by many well-known dealers and breeders in the Commonwealth, and has been adjudged by all to be the finest and most valuable in the state. It has also been a source of great convenience to local, Interstate, New Zealand, and South African Buyers. The comprehensive nature of the collection can be judged from the following particulars which are recorded on the respective photographs:

Utica Copper Mine. Some time ago an engine and pump were fixed 30 feet in the drive from the 100’ level saving unnecessary rods, gearing etc. had it been placed at the top of the shaft. The exhaust was carried well up the shaft and helped create a draught of cool air which improved working conditions. On Saturday when six men were working in the drive the exhaust somehow became disconnected and filled the shaft with fumes. The men were trapped and help had to be got from above. The engine was, of course, stopped and candles put out to save oxygen. T. Geach managed to climb the shaft, barely reaching the top. Messrs Duldig & C. McWaters happened along and the men were hauled up one by one in the bucket. There should have been some ventilation from a 10” winsell, but it was a calm day and the winsell, being canvas, sagged and stopped the airflow. With hindsight the winsell should have been of iron. Involved were Mr C.W.H. Saunders of Horwood & Co. who installed the plant, Thomas Geach, H. Broad, William Pryor Sen., T. Pryor Jun., and W. Irlam.

Obituary. Mrs Richard Reed [Ann], aged 78, died on 4 November [at Redruth, residence Aberdeen]. She was the daughter of Mr John Henwood and was born at Lostwith[i]el Cornwall in 1836. She arrived at Geelong in 1856 and lived at Colac for 12 months before coming to Burra and was married two years later in old St Mary’s on Limestone Hill, by Rev. Ibbitson, to Richard Reed who survives her. (1859) They lived at Copperhouse for some time before taking up Wandillah. For the first three years they fought drought. They stayed there for 30 years, leaving about 20 years ago to retire to Aberdeen. There were 9 children, of whom 6 survive: Mrs George Sara, Mrs C. Bartholomæus, Miss Clara Reed, and Messrs Richard, John and James who are all stockowners and breeders. There are 26 grandchildren. Mr Reed Sen. came to Burra 66 years ago in a bullock wagon. Mr Montgomery, who drove the bullocks is still alive at 94 and lives nearby.

Burra Town Council, Monday.

Council will attend the opening of the new Methodist Church in Kooringa.

A petition seeking work for the 50 unemployed men in the district was received. A meeting is called for Tuesday night.

Cr Radford suggested they ask the Government for a £200 advance on the annual grant in order to raise road metal – preferable to a loan which would have to be repaid and would increase the assessment.

The Mayor thought they needed a special grant. (To be repaid via the annual grant.)

This was what was eventually carried.

Cr Harris moved the garden in Chapel St be called the Holder Garden. 2nd Cr Wicklein & carried.

Cr Radford moved the electric lighting scheme submitted by Messrs Turner, Robertson & Co. last year be not accepted. Carried.

Weather. Last weekend was hot, clammy, thundery and dusty. Rain fell further north at Petersburg which got 3” from Friday to Monday. Terowie had good rain and even Booborowie got 1.87” on Friday alone. Rain began in Burra on Monday and to 3 o’clock Tuesday 0.61” had fallen. Rain to the east is variable, but most stations report at least 0.50” and Sturt Vale 1.00”, Braemar 0.75” & Faraway 0.75”. It is still raining to the east.

Notice. There will be an extraordinary election for the West Ward due to the resignation of Ludwig Leopold Wicklein as Councillor.

Burra Town Council

Cr Wicklein asked leave to make a statement. Granted.

Of late many hard things had been said about him. They had been repeated to him and he had done his best to ignore them. He had been accused of disloyalty and cruel and false accusations had been made. It was falsely alleged he had been born in Germany. His father was of Hungarian origin but had been naturalised 50 years ago. His mother and all his family were born in SA. He was as loyal to his king and country as anyone, but under the circumstances he felt it would be better if he stood down from Council and he asked leave to resign.

Cr Radford said if it were him he would stick to his guns. He acknowledged the suspicion and no doubt there were disloyal persons, but he was sure this was not the case with Cr Wicklein.

Cr Lane thought it a hard matter to speak to and Cr Wicklein was in a painful position and if he thought it would help to stifle the rumours if he resigned then perhaps it was the better course.

Cr Harris was shocked by the statement and felt much as Cr Lane.

The Mayor acknowledged the rumours, thanked Cr Wicklein for his services and considered his decision a manly one, preventing further unpleasantness for himself and his colleagues.

Cr Wicklein thanked the Mayor for his kind remarks and hoped to prove his loyalty in the coming days and to offer his services again after the war. Even his children had not escaped slurs being cast at them.

Cr Lane moved Cr Wicklein’s resignation be accepted with the deepest regret and a minute be placed recording the best thanks of the town for Cr Wicklein’s service during his three years in office. Cr Harris 2nd and endorsed the motion.

Cr Harris announced he would not be seeking re-election due to changed family circumstances.

Mr A.J. McBride has been asked to stand for West Ward.

Mr T. McWaters will stand for East Ward and there is a move to get C.D. Wilkinson to stand for Mr Wicklein’s seat on West Ward.

Kooringa Court, Monday.

Thomas Casey was fined 10/- for being drunk, but whilst drunk he had said:

‘The King is a — rotten — cow’,

had made similar remarks about Queen Mary and Lord Kitchener and gave three cheers for the Kaiser. For this he was sentenced to 14 days for disloyal language and the matter was reported to Military Authorities for further enquiry.

Letter from ‘Caution’ re German loyalty:

[The paper of the 11 November had reported that the District Clerk had objected to doing what he regarded as the work of the Military Authorities in distributing forms from them to men who wished to volunteer – or at least that seems to be the meaning of the exchange of views as reported.]

Obituary. Mr W.T. Gillett, aged 44, died [at Kooringa] on 16 November from pleurisy and pneumonia.

Unemployment Meeting in the Council Chamber on Tuesday last week.

The mayor explained The Council was doing what it could and had decided at its meeting the previous night to apply for a special grant of £200 for main roadwork.

There were 48 names on the petition.

The mayor said the quarries were fully working with c. 30 men employed.

Mr Turley said he believed locals had been neglected with men from Port Pirie etc. working on relaying the local railway line.

The Mayor said the town had no debt and if it borrowed there would have to be an increase in tax [i.e. rates]

Mr Geach thought a loan a good idea.

Mr Lawn thought they should exhaust the Government grant first.

The mayor thought they should not be afraid to borrow if it was still needed after their income and the Government grant had been expended.

Mr Thamm moved they urge the Government to get on with enlarging the town reservoir at once.

Mr Phillips thought that married men should be employed locally and single men be expected to go further afield.

Mr Lawn said some single men support families.

Since the meeting work has been found but the report is not very clear about how many and with whom.

[It seems to say 10 married men offered jobs relaying the railway line and 30 men, including single men with dependants could be put on. (Apparently at the same job.)

In the next paper the Mayor’s report makes it clear that it meant that 30 men, married and single, were taken on the railway relay gang.]

Belgian Relief Fund

At a public meeting on Wednesday 18 November the Mayor, Mr Crewes, presided and saw the formation of a committee to raise money for Belgian relief. F.C. Harvey was appointed secretary and treasurer. As well as money there was an urgent need for clothing. Mr Crewes was elected President. Mr Dane offered the money from the next patriotic concert to the fund. Several sporting events have been suggested to raise money.

Patriotic Fund Committee

Mr Radford suggested that a portion of the fund be given to the Belgian Fund, but Mr Crewes said he did not believe it possible as they were committed for specific purposes. Also the Red Cross ladies have said they have enough to do without getting involved with the Belgian Fund.

The Methodist Sunday school children have given up their annual picnic and donated £10-10-0 to the Belgian Fund.

Mr C. Fuss moved that the request of the Belgian Committee be acceded to that for a time all patriotic fund raising from the various subcommittees go to the Belgian Fund.

Leighton Patriotic Fund: £55-9-10.

The Season: Leighton area farmers are expected to reap little more than seed wheat this year.

Burra’s Fire Bug. A little time ago Mr D. Pizzo’s house in Kangaroo St was damaged when the paling roof under the iron caught fire from soot. It was being repaired by Mr John Pearce and the family was living in an adjacent house. On Sunday morning an attempt was made to burn down the house under repair. Kerosene was used to ignite a door and fire was set in two other places. Footprints were found, but M-C Queale’s covering of them ‘fortunately [sic] did not make them rain-proof with the result that a shower washed them out.’ [Presumably should read ‘unfortunately!]

Burra Racing Club AGM was held at the Liberal Union Rooms on Friday last and reported a very successful meeting on 17 January 1914. £276 had been spent on improvements and money in the bank was now just £0-7-4. Robert McBride had sunk a well for them for ample water. C.B. Warnes timbered the same. A.J. McBride supplied a windmill and tank. John Berryman helped with pipes and laying them. The next meeting will be on 16 January 1915 with half the profits to go to the Belgian Relief Fund.

Cricket. Saturday at Victoria Park. Kooringa 170 defeated Squatters 155.

Mayor’s Report 1914

This year has been very dry and the harvest one of the worst known. Some farmers will not even reap seed wheat for next year. Hay and grass is very scarce and agistment has been sought where possible. This has impacted on town business as well.

War, of course, has been the other great event of the year. This immediately led to a grand patriotic meeting and the formation of the Patriotic Fund with its working committees. So Far £259-13-10 has been raised. Money raised locally for the war effort from all sources and for all causes is c. £800. The Red Cross Branch has raised £67-1-8. A committee to raise money and other aid for the Belgian Relief Fund has also bee established.

23 Burra Boys have already sailed with the 1st Contingent for service in Europe.

Unemployment.

War and drought combined have led to local unemployment. To counter this the Council has applied for a special grant of £200 to be repaid over several years. This plus the usual subsidy of £430 will be applied to main roadwork. We anticipate a favourable reply. We have also asked for more work for local men on relaying the railway and at the quarries and to immediately proceed with the new town reservoir. (Since writing the above 30 married and single men have been put on the railway re-lay gang.)

Electric Lighting

This has been much discussed and information from other centres gathered. In several places the schemes are too recent to allow useful evaluation. Under prevailing conditions of drought, tight money market and war, it was decided not to proceed and the scheme proposed by the previous Council was turned down.

Fire Brigade

In the light of recent fires the Council is looking into provision of a fire brigade.

Burra Coronation Band

This is still very active and has rendered valuable service in the year under the leadership now of Mr James Bentley following Fred Wheatley who left with the 1st Contingent.

The Seaside Trip was a great success and we hope a similar excursion will be held in 1915.

Trains

The Council has managed to get the restoration of the cancelled services on Saturday night and Monday morning.

Burra Hospital

The Mayor has achieved an ex officio place on the Board which Council deemed justified since the Hospital is vested in the Council.

[The accounts are then printed.]

The General account was in credit £1-10-1.

North Ward had a debt of £24-15-2.

East Ward had a debt of £0-8-7.

West Ward was in credit £4-0-10.

Rate income for the wards is fairly even with the north a little lower:

North £139-1-9

East £147-19-0

West £143-0-6

[Continues on page 4.]

The Parklands

The rate for the year had to be increased from 2d to 6d to pay for the purchase of the Burra Creek and another block of land bought by the previous Council. The sum was £184-6-0. The Parkland account, after very careful management is in debt £42-18-3 which is a good result. 600 trees have been bought, but held in reserve due to the drought.

Council wishes to form and plant gardens in previously unsightly spots. This year one has been made in Chapel St and named ‘Holder Garden’. Others are in course of construction in West and North Wards. It is also planned to plant the Burra Creek and the west side of the road from St Mary’s to the Mine Bridge.

Cemetery

This account is in credit £78-5-1 despite having a new portion surveyed and pegged out for use. A portion of the new ground is allotted for Catholic use.

Main Roads

In 1914 portions of roads in the south and north of the town have been experimentally tar paved. This has been successful and will be extended. The drought has made road making difficult.

Local Board of Health

The credit balance fell from £60-1-1 to £26-13-1, but the rate was dropped from 10d to 6d to transfer money to the Parklands account as above. A reversal of this adjustment is probable in future as we need to provide against epidemic outbreak.

The Health Officer reported only four cases of infectious disease: two of tuberculosis and one each of diphtheria and enteric fever. The tuberculosis and enteric fever came from outside the district. Influenza and pneumonia have recently been a major problem caused largely by abnormal weather.

Post Office

A new post and telegraph office for Aberdeen has been denied by the Department.

The town has, despite the drought, seen new business places erected and new and substantial dwellings erected and the telephone system greatly extended. [Note that as yet no advertisements in the paper cite telephone numbers.]

Obituary. William Nelson died at the Burra Hospital on 29 November. He was a brother of Mrs T. Halls Sen. and a long-term resident of Burra. The cause of death was pneumonia. [The death notice in the paper of 9 December gave his age as 64, but he was born 16 April 1854 at Le Fevre Peninsula SA.]

Obituary. Clement A. Pearce, aged 10, son of Mr & Mrs Walter Pearce died of pneumonia on 29 November. [Clement Alfred Pearce born 26 November 1904 at Kooringa.]

War Matters

The Burra boys of the 1st Contingent are said to be among troops currently employed in guarding the Suez Canal, though this is only rumour.

The 2nd Contingent: Burra boys are W. Klaufhause of Aberdeen [Klaffus], W.R. Hawkes of Koonoona, and Alan Carey of Kooringa.

The 3rd Contingent: volunteers are W. Pederson, R. Ockenden, W. Ford, Hartley Harris, Percy Fuss, A. Hopcraft, S. Jones and — Edwards.

Nurse Mosey and Nurse Woods, formerly Matrons of Burra Hospital, have gone to the front.

Ratepayers’ Meeting, Thursday 26 November.

There was a large attendance with Mr Winnall in the chair.

Mr [C.] Fuss moved a vote of thanks for the retiring Councillors.

Mr Crewes said he would gladly retire in favour of another candidate, but as none had come forward he was willing to continue. He referred to his report for the year. He was glad to have upset the unsatisfactory electric light scheme proposed for £2,500, but would work towards an efficient scheme which would probably cost £5,000, but would light the whole town. He thought the rates should be: General 1/-, Health 6d, Park Lands 3d and Lighting 3d. The cemetery now had 960 vacant blocks. He was glad to say the Council in 1914 had worked very amicably. The tar-paving had been an unqualified success and would certainly be extended.

Mr Thomas McWaters promised do what the electors wanted. (He had 25 years experience with the District Council before moving into town to live.)

A.J. McBride felt he could soon learn about municipal matters and would do his best.

C.D. Wilkinson said something similar.

J.C. Killicoat as candidate for North Ward thought the Aberdeen post office issue should be revisited. He had experience of electric light and believed most schemes had failures due to lack of horsepower in their engines. A fire brigade was very necessary.

Cr Walker would not like to leave the Council while the North Ward was in debt.

Mr J. Richards asked if candidates would get the dangerous ruins of the German Church torn down as they were ‘hanging over four feet’.

Mr Bevan said other premises were hanging over the footpath three feet.

The Mayor advised that all nuisances should be drawn to the attention of the Inspector. He said the structure known as ‘Dead Man’s Bridge’ on Cemetery Rd was a disgrace. The intention was to continue the road in front of Mr McWaters and put a new bridge in line with the present road. The problem was funding.

Mr McWaters said the £200 special grant should be used and if not the Government should be asked for assistance.

Cricket. Saturday at Clare: Kooringa 273 defeated Clare 151. (A. Gebhardt for Kooringa scored 105)

Burra Rifle Club reopened last Saturday when the best scores (with handicap) were A.P. Harris 104, from A.D. McLaren, A. Langford, & H.L. Riggs all on 97.

Fire Bug. The 5th attack occurred on Monday. About 12.30 a.m. Monday morning Mrs Lord heard a noise and told her husband she thought someone was stealing chaff from their sheds. While investigating Mr Lord saw flames and smoke coming from the rear of Walker & Sons and found a crate of crockery packed in straw burning quite fiercely. He contacted M-C Queale and also wakened Mr A. Walker who put out the fire with a patent fire extinguisher.

A blacktracker arrived on the Monday train. A man with a limp in his right leg was tracked to the National Bank and thence to Paxton Square and then to a house towards the cemetery. Investigation continues. The damage was c. £16 and a reward of £25 is offered.

Mrs Mary Blott, widow of William Blott, turned 94 on 3 December. She was born in Cambridgeshire in 1820. She has lived the last 20 years with her daughter Mrs Frank Smith, of Norwood. Five of her siblings are still alive: Mr John Tilbrook of Koolunga (91), a sister in Adelaide (88), and James Tilbrook (90) in the UK. The two eldest died aged 97 & 95. Mr & Mrs Blott arrived in SA in 1849 on the Octavia and took up land in the Onkaparinga District, but failed. Mr Blott then tried the Victorian Goldfields and on returning they came to Burra where they lived for many years.

War Matters

Mr Hartley Harris writes of good time in camp. There is a movement to get the boys from Burra, presently in camp, back for a day or so for a send-off. Mr F.C. Harvey of the Bank of Australasia is volunteering and Lieut. Copley is to go with the 3rd Contingent.

Kooringa Methodist Church. The new building was opened Saturday 12 December. The new church has been erected on the site of the old which served for upwards of 60 years. It is a handsome building. Designed in English Gothic, it is built in local bluestone, finished with cemented buttresses, dressings and mouldings with spinets. Inside it is 64’ x 40’ and almost 53’ hight to the top of the external gable. In front two flights of steps lead to two entrance doors and a fine vestibule. There is a window either side of the vestibule and a triple window above. All are glazed with lead-lights in a chaste and beautiful design. There are six windows on either side. Two are glazed with lead-lighted memorial windows. The hammerbeam principals are of red pine and the ceiling of fibrous plaster. It is well ventilated and acoustically good. The pulpit & choir platform are in blackwood and at the rear are two vestries. All is surrounded by a substantial retaining wall and handsome cast-iron railing and cast-iron folding gates to match. The builders were Messrs J.T. Quinn & Co. of Hamley Bridge and the architects were Messrs Cowell & Cowell of Adelaide.

The weather on Saturday was hot, windy, and dusty. The Chief Justice, Sir Samuel Way, arrived and the scene was photographed by Messrs Page, Penrose and Muller.

In 1859 Sir Samuel’s father, Rev. James Way, was in charge of the Bible Christian circuit in Burra. Present also were Rev. Samuel Knight, now of Melbourne, Rev. W.F. James and Rev. G. Hall, the President of the Methodist Conference. Also the present town ministers, Rev. J.H. Nield and Rev. J.C. Jennison. The doors were opened by two of the churches oldest workers: Mrs Sleep and Mr William Davey.

Mrs Sleep was a member of the first Wesleyan Church in Burra. Mr Davey was remembered for being in charge of the services of song in the old Bible Christian Church. He had been the first organist of the Bible Christian Church and his sons Will & Arthur had succeeded him until the union of the churches.

The two memorial windows were unveiled. One is to the late Philip Lane – representing the Good Samaritan. The other is to the memory of Alex. Harris and bears the figure of St Barnabas.

Tea was followed by a public meeting. In the building of the church £3,315 had been spent and of this £2,451 had been raised by donations and the sale of property which had brought in £700.

Mr Quinn was presented with a bonus of £100 in gratitude for the way he had fulfilled his contract. Mr Quinn said he was speechless with surprise. Sir Samuel Way remembered the opening of the Bible Christian Church in 1860. He related some of the history of the town and hoped Dr Brummitt would do justice to it by writing it up. The town, he said, was the birthplace or abode of many able men, among them:

Dr Williams – now important in Victoria

The late Dr Stevens – President of the Victorian Conference and General Conference

Dr Burgess – three times President of the SA Conference

Rev. W.F. James – who built the Bible Christian parsonage which contributed £700 to the new church fund and who built the Hanson Bicentenary Church.

Rev. Jenkins – a Burra boy

Rev. Pope – a Burra boy

Sir Frederick Holder – the first Town Clerk

Philip Lane – the first mayor

Dr Brummitt

Mr J.M. McBride

Dr Torr

Rev. Richards

Captain Roach

Wherever his father worked there was a revival and in Burra there were 250 adult converts in a fortnight and 70 children.

Rev. Hall congratulated them all on behalf of the Conference.

Rev. S. Knight gave a short address.

Rev. J.H. Nield preached on Sunday and on Sunday afternoon the choral service The Rolling Seasons was presented.

In the evening Rev. George Hall gave a short address and Rev. S. Knight preached the sermon.

On Monday evening Rev. Henry Howard of Adelaide preached to a full church.

Much praise must go to Mr G. Dane for bringing the choir to perfection and to the organist, Miss Beatrix Pearce.

Burra Freemasons welcomed sir Samuel Way on Saturday afternoon. He has at intervals since 1884 been Grand Master of the Masonic Fraternity in SA. Some of the oldest members to meet Sir Samuel were P.M. Bro. W. West (Master 1875-6 & 1899) and P.M. Bro. H. Pinch (Master 1886).

Letter from ‘Living Yet’ wondering why the bridge on Ayers St is called Deadman’s Bridge. It was placed there by public subscription in the days before either a Town or District Council and speaks well of the old virtue of self-help. The fund available would not permit a direct route and the position was chosen on account of the foundations. I hope the old bridge will be preserved ‘to the memory of men that once lived for the Old Burra’.

War Matters

Hartley Harris is in camp as one of the 165 out of 1,200 picked to act as reserves for the 1st Expeditionary Force.

R.H. Woollacott [actually R.J.] writes from England that instead of coming home he is volunteering. He is presently at Windsor and will soon go to the front. In his letter he writes: ‘we must all . . . be prepared to make sacrifices to assist them [the younger men] in carrying this out’.

Burra State School speech Day and Prize Distribution was held on Thursday 17 December at the Institute. Mr Johnson, head teacher, reported there were 119 boys and 126 girls on the roll. Only 4 got through the examination to enter High School, though he had expected about 20 to do so.

The Institute was awarding 12 annual memberships to students.

Mrs Crewes was ill and unable to present the prizes. In awarding the Mayor’s medal for dux they had considered three candidates. Dorothy Pederson and Mary West each secured 85 points, but had been two years in the school. Fred Scholz had gained 83% in one year and contended with travelling about 10 miles to school, so the medal went to him.

Rev. Durnford’s prize for the best essay on Burra and District attracted 26 competitors and seven were tied for 1st place: Jean Litchfield, Josephine West, Vernon Fuss, Dorothy Bartholomæus and Hedley Pearce.

The prizes were distributed by Mrs J. McLaren.

The prize list is printed and extends to page 3.

On the Sydney three men were killed and three wounded we were told.

There will be no leave in Colombo when we arrive.

Burra Town Council, Monday.

Bagot, Shakes & Lewis advise a contract has been let for the verandah in front of their premises.

New tie-up posts are to be placed at the cemetery.

The Mayor advocated the introduction of the Building Act to prevent the erection of unsightly structures.

‘At present anyone could disfigure the streets as they saw fit.’

To be further considered.

The Mayor said steps should be taken to get a hydrant and reel. A 3d rate could be struck.

Cr McBride said at present it wouldn’t be much good as two or three nights a week there was no water.

Cr Lane moved they write again to the Department.

Cr Radford thought the Railways Department’s reservoir at Firewood Creek should be big enough to supply the town.

A wire is to be sent to the Department and a deputation to follow after the holidays if there is no action.

Cr McWaters said three or four people had complained that they had been told by the overseer that if they raised more metal than their allocation it would be taken over by the corporation. About 100 yards had been so raised and the overseer said it could not be taken over.

The overseer said he had not given anyone authority to raise over their allocated quantity, but it was common practice by tenderers on the off-chance that it would be taken over by Council.

Cr Killicoat asked if the metal from the big Aberdeen Quarry was worth the extra money paid for it.

The overseer said it was worth an extra 1/- [a yard?] for its wearing qualities.

Cr McBride said the street lights were unsatisfactory and it was decided that the overseer would overhaul each lamp and then supervise their lighting for one month.

Local Board of Health

J.E.H. Winnall wrote concerning the depositing of rubbish on the approach to the depot in Bewley’s property.

Cr McBride said Mr Bewley had given permission for manure only to be put down, but tins had been thrown out too.

Cr McBride thought Council should get a lease of the road and then they would know their position.

The inspector is to inspect the railway quarry [ballast quarry] privies: said to be in a poor state.

There have been complaints about the behaviour of men working on the [railway] line at the navvy’s camp where there were no latrines. Railway department will be written to about this.

Cr McBride complained about the depositing of rubbish in the creek in Chapel St.

Mt Bryan East Methodist Sunday School Anniversary was held 29 November when Rev. Jew of Terowie preached.

Mt Bryan East School broke up on Friday 18 December and a concert was given in the evening. Mr Gare as chairman congratulated the teacher Miss Carter for organising it, but she was unfortunately absent due to a badly sprained ankle. A Christmas tree followed and all the children received gifts.

Characteristics of the 1914 Paper.

Page 1. This was a mixture of large advertisements and news, though the ‘news’ was often articles of general interest rather than current affairs type news. There was certainly no attempt to place the main stories of the week here.

Page 2. Larger advertisements and notices with a few classified advertisements. These occupy from half a page to about six columns and are followed by the news of the day.

Page 3. A few larger advertisements and news. There is thus quite a lot of space for news which is frequently given in great detail. Patriotic meetings, sport and Council meetings all get a lot of space. This was one of a number of years when the paper gave the buyer a lot to read each week.

Page 4. Small advertisements: mostly local. Some news was included here, but the amount varied greatly. Sometimes what looks to be a news article is an advertisement in disguise. News varies from about half a column to perhaps two columns.

In general the paper gave a detailed account of events in the town, particularly the patriotic events once the war started.

From the issue of 1 April an extra sheet was added as an insertion. This took the form of a literary and general interest supplement. It never carried advertisements or spill-over news and may well have been printed elsewhere as it is often on different paper from the rest of the publication.

It comprised a serialised novel, a short story, some poetry, often a children’s story and three columns devoted to women with fashion items, household hints and recipes.

Other articles of varying length were devoted to ‘Farm & Field’, ‘Science’, ‘Miscellaneous’ and ‘Odds and Ends’ [Jokes]. A column called ‘Items of Interest’ appeared sometimes

Numbering of issues in 1914

What would seem to be a practice of beginning a new volume each year is introduced, but this is an illusion: it holds for the start of 1914 and again in 1915, but breaks down in November 1915 and reverts to the usual irrational state of affairs in 1916.

The year began with Volume XXI Number 1875 on 7 January 1914.

And continued to Volume XXI Number 1925 on 23 December 1914.

Supplements 1914

Notes on the table.

a From 25 November the Miscellaneous column comprised mainly War Notes.

b The paper wasn’t published on 30 December, though the supplement is so dated: the microfilm for 6 January 1915 carries this with a hand corrected date.

You have probably heard by now of the crippling of the Emden so that it had to be beached on one of the Cocos Islands after an engagement with the Sydney. We got a pint of free beer in the afternoon. The 10th Battalion are holding sports today, but the weather has destroyed most interest. Rank and file were excluded from the deck and on hearing that several companies withdrew until the order was cancelled.

Letter from John Dun & Mrs Dun who tell of their experiences in wartime Paris – they were in Paris on 1 August.

Belgian Relief Fund. Committee meeting last Thursday. Mr Sommerville has been elected Secretary to replace Mr Fred Harvey, who has volunteered. So far promises are for £183-2-11 and £158-8-6 has been collected and banked. It was decided to make a special appeal for January and keep the Belgian Fund open till the end of the month. They decided again to purchase the pictures and run them on the oval as before.

Burra Institute, AGM. The President, C.A. Fuss, was out of town on business and Rev. J.H. Nield, Vice-President, took the chair. The Treasurer, T.W. Wilkinson was absent on account of ill health. In the last year the library has been rearranged. There are now 4252 volumes. Subscribers are up 8 at 138. The financial position is strong at £133-11-0 in credit. First Aid classes had been run by Drs Sangster and Steele. Orchestral and Choral classes had been run by Mr Dane. In the year improvements had cost £182-9-0, of which £72-2-4 had been for improved seating.

A platform had been erected for the convenience of picture shows to keep the operator away from the crowd.

The Council Chamber had been renovated with a beautiful new fibrous plaster ceiling and a new floor and the walls had been repapered.

The caretaker’s cottage now has a bathroom.

It is intended to place another escape door on the north side of the hall early in 1915.

Election: President Rev. J.H. Nield

Vice-President W.S. Thomson

Treasurer T.W. Wilkinson

Secretary J. Drew

Mr Crewes thought they should consider a billiard room, especially if 6 o’clock closing of hotels came in. E.J. Davey said the early closing would not affect billiard rooms. He could not support billiards which was surrounded by evil. Mr Sommerville said the Terowie Institute billiard room was a great success and the idea seemed to gain general acceptance.

Railways Standing Committee is considering the various proposals for a Booborowie railway.

Spalding to Booborowie via Yatina Gap

Farrell’s Flat to Booborowie

Hanson to Booborowie

This last seems the most favoured, but there is a complication in that any railway might interfere with the profitability of the Spalding Railway which was built under the guarantee system.

Lindsay Kemble, who is well-known in Burra, (aged 19) was arrested in Adelaide masquerading in women’s clothing as Miss De Vere. The report gives a detailed description of his attire.

Charles Thomson of the National Bank has been transferred to Moonta. Mr Wheaton comes here from Moonta.

Burra Unemployed. A meeting was held on Wednesday with E.W. Crewes in the chair. Following the reply from the commissioner Mr Crewes thought they needed to ascertain the numbers involved and their dependents. One complaint was that some single men were kept on and married men with families dismissed. The Mayor said that only the town reservoir was available locally and the Town Clerk had again wired Adelaide to try to get that moving.

[From Mr Turley’s remarks it would seem that 30 of the 80 dismissed were Burra men.]

The Mayor and Councillors will form a deputation to the Commissioner urging the reinstatement or the finding of work elsewhere. M-C Queale said that the number of unemployed registered was 72 with 130 dependents.

Letter from Elizabeth Ann Ward of Hill St defending the reputation of Lindsay Kemble. He is not disreputable, nor idle nor disorderly. In Burra, and until the war started, he was in a vaudeville company which he had to leave due to severe pneumonia. He left Burra with the Tom Thumb Co. The masquerade that landed him in trouble was an exceedingly clever joke and by no means as disgraceful as it appeared to be. [Lindsay’s later career with some reference to this incident appears in the papers for 3 Sep. 1919, 31 Mar. 1920 and 14 July 1920.]

Pte F.C. Carey was farewelled at the Masonic Lodge on Tuesday last week.

Accident. J.M.C. Bennett who was driving one of I.J. Warnes’ cars on Monday had a miraculous escape when the car skidded in sand on the Baldina Ford and broke part of its steering gear. The car plunged 14’ off the ford and landed on its nose before turning upside down. Mr Bennett was deposited in a water-filled cleft between rocks and as the door was open he could crawl out unhurt. The wire rope protection at the ford broke away some time ago and has not been replaced.

Seaside Excursion. The committee had £20-15-8 in hand and there was great division whether to hold a trip or not this year. A motion was put by Mr Harvey and 2nd Mr Lott to do so was eventually carried 36 to 17 and the date for the excursion to Semaphore is 27 February. Cost 5/6 & 2/9. The train departs Burra at 5.30 a.m.

XXII, 1928, 20 Jan. 1915, page 3

St Andrew’s Church Mt Bryan.

[There is a long and interesting if at times confused article on Anglican History in the Burra District occupying 11⁄4 columns.]

This is the first church built in the St Mary’s Mission District. The Church of the Ascension at Black Springs was bought from the District Council 17 [sic] years ago in the time of Rev. A.G. King, for £50. [In view of the dedication date this figure might be an error for 7 years ago.] It had previously been a Methodist Church, a dwelling, a District Council Chamber and various other things. It was thoroughly renovated and dedicated by Bishop Harmer 22 September 1908.

[The text here becomes garbled and the dates impossible to reconcile. It says the missions at the time were two in number – in the same year increased to three when T.H. Bailey allowed his Gum Creek schoolroom to be used for services. The text then says that in 1907 there were four missions and Mt Bryan is the youngest.]

It continues by saying there are now six missions with Farrell’s Flat being added the year before last, covering an area from Booborowie to Mt Bryan East and Farrell’s Flat to Ulooloo. To the north it adjoins the Hundred of Hallett and the southern boundary of the new Diocese of Willochra, whose first bishop is to be appointed on 26 January 1915.

[Though not specified, it would seem from the above that the six missions were then: Gum Ck, Farrell’s Flat, Black Springs, Hallett, Mt Bryan and Booborowie, unless Mt Bryan East was a separate entity.]

In 1890, the last year that St Mary’s stood alone without mission churches, the income was put at £1,369 – more than for any other church in SA, partly because in that year the debt of £825 was abolished. The Bishop’s Home Mission Society assisted the Hallett Mission by £4 in 1891 and now helps by £70.

At Mt Bryan, five years ago services were held in the Institute, even carrying the organ across the railway line for services.

The new church opens with a debt of £150, having spent £460 on building and furniture. The Ven. Archdeacon Bussell officiated. W.B. Page, organist of St Mary’s, played for the service of dedication.

The stone comes from the Burra quarries of Henry Thomas. The nave is 30’ x 19’ and rises 25’6” to the ridge. The chancel is in the form of an apse.

Donors of various furnishings are then listed.

Obituary & Inquest. John Hammer, aged 70, died as the result of a motor accident on 16 January. E.W. Crewes was coroner on 17 January.

J.W. Aldridge, farmer of Booborowie:

Was riding in the car with Dr Sangster going to Aberdeen from the races. About 100 yards from the bend we met a vehicle whose horse shied across into our path. Dr Sangster steered hard left. At the same time a man walking on the left started across from the left hand side to the right hand side which forced the doctor to pull strongly to the right to avoid him. In doing so a tyre came off which caused the car to swing around and strike the man. Dr Sangster examined the man, who was bleeding from the ears and mouth, and sent him to the hospital. Do not know who was driving the trap, but they lost control and got onto the wrong side of the road.

William Bass, labourer of Kooringa, gave evidence confirming Aldridge’s account. He believed the car to be doing c. 12 m.p.h.

Dr Steele gave evidence that the man had suffered a large skull fracture and haemorrhage of the brain.

Dr Sangster Jun.’s evidence was essentially that of Aldridge.

He said the man died just before the ambulance arrived. He believed he was doing under 15 m.p.h. He did not know of any carelessness on the part of the trap driver.

William J. Richards, manager of Murray Aunger Motor Garage had looked at the tyre marks and said they were consistent with the evidence given. They car had stopped within 15-20 yards.

M-C Queale gave evidence on receiving the body.

The verdict was of accidental death with no blame attachable to anybody.

Local Board of Health. There are presently two cases of typhoid in town.

Offence. Harry Mendelsohn was charged with stealing 2/6 from A.F. Heinrich at the Burra Races on Saturday by giving short change. After evidence was tendered he decided to plead guilty and was fined £5 plus 14/- costs or one month jail.

He was caught because he had tried the same trick on Thomas P. Halls Sen. who then watched him do it to Heinrich and gave evidence of how it was worked.

Burra Town Council, Monday night.

A letter from the Commissioner of Public Works saying that on application from the Mayor a special grant of £100 had been given.

Cr Lane complained that the Mayor had not been part of the deputation.

Cr McWaters explained that when Cr Lane met the train in Adelaide Mr Crewes had not been there because he had received a wire saying that work had been found for the unemployed at Oodnadatta and there was no need for the deputation.

Cr Lane said he had kept the appointment and had met Mr Butler. Cr McWaters had been introduced as Chairman of the District Council and the deputation had resulted in a special grant of £200 to the D.C. and £100 to the Town Council.

The Mayor said he had not shirked his duties as a wire had arrived from the Commissioner beginning ‘Deputation Unnecessary arrangements made with the Railway Commissioner . . .’

Cr Lane clearly thought the other Councillors should have attended as the work of the deputation extended beyond the finding of railway jobs.

Cr Radford thought that a public meeting could not appoint Councillors to act: only the Council could do that.

The mayor agreed that strictly speaking the actions of Crs Lane and McWaters were illegal, but he agreed the deputation was not confined to the reinstatement of the men. The action may have been illegal, but it was a good thing and their action must now be endorsed.

And so it was.

Burra Races on Saturday 16 January.

There was a fair attendance. The meeting was conducted almost where the 1876 meeting had been held. The results are printed. The main race was the Burra Handicap over 11⁄4 miles for 80 sovereigns and was won by W. Standley’s ALRAF ridden by J. Liddle.

Burra Unemployment. On Monday afternoon at the Burra Hotel 35 unemployed men met. The Mayor was surprised at the number as work for 50 was offered at Oodnadatta and only 12 were going. One problem was that it cost £2-18-0 for a return fare with no guarantee of the length of employment. F. Thomas was going – he said the work would last at least two months and probably six.

M-C Queale said he believed it was for 9/- a day for 5 days a week and tucker would cost 15/- a week.

A voice said that meant working for £5 for 9 weeks after paying for fares.

After a vote 15 said they would go for 2 months guaranteed work, but 16 declined.

Relaying work on the northern line was stopped due to lack of funds. There will be some work on the Morgan line soon and a railway reservoir will be built near Burra if a suitable site can be found.

It is said there are about 70 unemployed in the town.

‘are you keeping them home to do odd jobs, or perhaps drive you around in your motor cars, while the common drinking herd fight to save it for you? We, who love our liberty, and our glass of beer, when we feel inclined that way, think it time that you put some khaki breeches on your feather-legged-sons and send them to help our soldier boys, instead of maligning them.’

Leighton and Gum Creek Schools.

F.G. Scholz chaired a meeting at Leighton Hall on 30 January to consider the very dilapidated state of the school. The place needed rebuilding. There are c. 30 pupils. 75% come from the east and a new school could be built further east, but recent closer settlement meant that in future more might come from the west. Some thought two schools were needed. The Gum Ck School has an average of 14 with 18 on the roll. It is only a half time school and in future the inhabitants intend to erect a school and request a full teacher.

A motion called for the issue to be postponed for 12 months due to the bad season.

Burra Racing Club. The annual race meeting had made a loss of £125. I.J. Warnes presided and was surprised and disappointed at the absence of the President, Mr A.G. Gebhardt, at this time of crisis. Thomas McWaters wondered who owned the improvements: if it was the sporting syndicate they could guarantee the overdraft. G. Lord said £300 of improvements had been erected. The club had failed to go through with getting a lease and therefore had no claim on the improvements. Mr Truscott said the difficulty is entirely our own fault. A lease had been offered at £10 p.a. for 20 years and the Racing Club had failed to follow through. It was decided to try and get sheep men to give donations to write off the debt; in the meantime the committee would guarantee the debt.

Redruth Local Court.

George Thorpe sued Murray Aunger Ltd, Motor Importers, for £490 damages for libel. Thorpe had been manager for Murray Aunger in Burra for some years. W.J. Davey Jun. had purchased from Thorpe an electric torch for 5/6. He had paid Thorpe two weeks later and Thorpe had promised to send a receipt, but didn’t do so and Davey continued to get accounts for it. Davey wrote explaining the matter after receiving the 2nd monthly account. The company replied that having checked the matter with Mr Thorpe they believed the account was in order, but they would get back to Mr Thorpe and would let Davey know the result in due course. When the company wrote to Thorpe he contacted his solicitors who wrote to the company expressing his offence at the implication of their letter to Davey. Thorpe says he handed the money to J. Richards Jun., the bookkeeper, who then apparently failed to issue a receipt, though questioned twice on the matter. Thorpe denied:

He was ever questioned by the company about the matter

That he ever said the account was quite in order

That he had no right to accept the money

The letter to Davey was a false and malicious libel that injured Thorpe’s reputation for honest dealing. The company replied that before leaving their employ he had gone through the accounts and certified the list of outstanding debts to be correct. The list included the 5/6 for the torch.

The defence said the words complained of did not bear the meaning put on them.

[Thorpe had since transferred to manage Eyes and Crowles which had started under Thorpe.]

The very detailed evidence traces the company’s change of management to J.W. Richards and Thorpe’s subsequent departure, and runs for over four columns on page 1 with a concluding paragraph on page 4.

The court summed up in favour of the complainant and the jury assessed damages at £100 plus costs.

Advt. Labor Party Election Meeting in the Institute on 10 February. Messrs George, Pearce and Penglase will speak. Also in the Rotunda on Friday night 12 February.

Methodism and the War. A letter from a Methodist Chaplain in Egypt says there are 6,500 Methodists in the Australian Expeditionary Forces around Cairo and another source says they are 12% of the 1st Contingent. [A refutation of the previous week’s claim that they were but 2%.]

Volunteers. Chester Sandland and Trevor Hawkes leave today on the SS Moldavia, for

England where they intend to volunteer.

Redruth Court House is a disgrace. It is very poorly ventilated and the furniture seems not to have been replaced or repaired for 50 years. The witness box is wrongly placed behind the solicitors’ table. The bench is altogether too low.

Burra Town Council.

There is written confirmation that tenders for the new town reservoir will be called in February.

John A. Rosewall has been appointed Overseer. (From 12 applicants.)

H.J. Wilson has been appointed curator of the cemetery. (From 13 applicants.)

Editorial on the Seaside Trip. In such a time of financial hardship and war it was after considerable debate that the trip was decided upon. Some took exception to the idea that those in debt would go on an excursion practically at the expense of their creditors. Rumours abounded. Walker & Sons have been accused of threatening to summons any of their debtors who took the trip. Of course this is nonsense, but it is liable to do them harm. They have taken out an advertisement labelling it as ‘absolutely untrue’. Similarly wild rumours are reported from Mintaro because this year no second train will run. If the train from Burra is not filled the committee will consider the possibility of taking passengers from Farrell’s Flat and Mintaro.

Theft. Mr H. Austin has had a dressed sheep carcase stolen from his slaughterhouse and has also lost hay, lucerne and other fodder. He offers a £5 reward.

The Mine Pool. Last Saturday was a special ladies’ day at the pool and 20-30 took advantage of the instruction available. A large number of envious youths had to content themselves with a seat on the bank. A number of young ladies have returned for a sunrise dip since, or for an evening swim.

Burra Rifle Club. The progressive points for Mrs C.W. Pearce’s oil painting are: A.P. Harris 14, J.E. Pearce 12 and E.A. Riggs 12, Captain Lord 11.

Burra Town Council, Monday.

The cost of tar-paving Commercial St was £6-17-1 per chain, which rose to £7-4-6 where some shouldering was required. Three chains in Aberdeen, where no shouldering was needed were done for £6-16-2 per chain.

There was debate over the need for a pound within the town as the present one at Ford’s was 11⁄4 miles out and it was difficult to get old milch cows so far.

Redruth Police Court, 26 February.

Percy Clark was charged with unlawfully assaulting M-C Horace Queale and in turn charged M-C Queale with assaulting him. Queale said he had entered the Commercial Hotel at 11 p.m. on 30 January and asked 7 or 8 men to leave. They did so and then Clark abused him and told him to get out of his hotel and then struck him a blow on his lip, cutting it. Clark seemed the worse for drink and threatened to fight him in the yard as well.

Queale said he was on duty at the picture carnival till 10.45 p.m. He had then had two glasses of beer at Clark’s and then stood on Dalgety’s Corner till 11 p.m. before returning to Clark’s. W.H. Stevenson, who was one of those in the parlour who was asked to leave, gave evidence supporting Queale’s account.

Percy w. Clark, hotel manager, claimed he had warned the men in the parlour to leave and had told them not to ride bicycles without lights as the John Hops were about. [The others had denied this.] He claimed to be sober. He said that Queale, on coming out of the parlour had shaken his cane at him and he had grabbed it and a wrestle had followed. He denied hitting him with a fist. All witnesses were mistaken about his condition and he did not offer to fight Queale.

Various hotel employees gave evidence which largely corroborated the Queale version of events. They tried to put Clark in the best possible light and said he was sober and tried to suggest at least some degree of provocation on Queale’s part.

The charge against Queale was dismissed and the costs of it awarded against Clark for £5-4-0. On his charge Clark was fined £5 including costs.

Letter from ‘Fairplay’ responding to ‘L.A.M.’ variously countering his points and maintaining with some force that ‘if a man owes the money he gambles away it is [a crime].

Letter from ‘Sympathetic’ urging that the Belgian Fund remain open beyond the projected £250 in view of the level of distress there.

Obituary. Nicholas Dunstan Bennett died suddenly at Nailsworth on Saturday. The deceased was born at Constantine, Norfolk in 1834 and arrived in Adelaide in January 1856 on the Marion after a voyage of 113 days. He went to the Victorian diggings for five months before coming to work in the Burra Mine. Later he opened a school at Black Springs and in 1859 took charge of the Government school at Redruth and in 1860 bought the goodwill of Mr Forder’s school. Five years later he became clerk of Moonta Local Court and filled various Government positions for the next 27 years, retiring in 1892 to Nailsworth. Four sons and one daughter survive: A.D. Bennett, Dr T.C. Bennett, Dr A.H. Bennett (Hampstead), C.E. Bennett (Adelaide) and Mrs Bennett Willinson [sic: for Wilkinson] (Perth). [Died 20 February 1915 at Prospect aged 80.]

Letter from ‘L.A.M.’ again, attacking ‘Fairplay’ and asking whether the latter would care to go to Oodnadatta, work under the conditions for the amount on offer and try to support his family on what is left.

‘He would come creeping back like a whipped puppy with his tail down, not even heart enough to carry his swag.’

‘Fairplay says it’s the workers’ fault they are so badly off now because they waste what they earn.’

This terrible drought is enough to cripple nearly all the industries . . .

Letter from E.A. Wohling attacking the cowardly ‘Fairplay’ for insulting the working men of Burra from behind a nom-de-plume. Consider the Oodnadatta men: five men worked for five weeks in blistering heat and dense flies and mosquitoes, contending with sand and sore eyes. After paying for provisions for the five weeks they could send £1 to their families. He [‘Fairplay’] also contended that those at Pinnaroo must be well off to afford living in a hotel as some are. At 17/6 a week they are doing well: otherwise they would have to buy a tent and utensils etc., buy food, which in the heat, ants and sand would involve considerable wastage. ‘Fairplay’ would need much more evidence otherwise intelligent workers ‘must accept the assurance that you narrowly escape being a natural born lunatic’.

Belgian Relief Fund. There is considerable enthusiasm to take up the challenge for further money raising. Mr McLaren as secretary of the fund has sent off another £70 from the sum raised. The Mayor has arranged a band concert for Friday night. Mr Lane will lend his shop next to the Savings Bank as a depot for goods to be auctioned. Mr McLaren offered to do the auctioning. Mr Walker thought stores with old stock might make a donation. A weekly donation scheme was also suggested. The above were all endorsed by a public meeting at which nearly £18 was immediately promised. The Musical Committee meeting saw the Hockey Club agree to give a concert and Miss Pearce will arrange a ‘Birthday Party’ and Miss Bullen a Children’s Concert. The Brass Band concert last Friday raised £3-15-10. The town will be canvassed with weekly subscription cards. The fund now totals £259-6-10.

An East Ward deputation wants a street lamp in Kingston St near Mr Davey’s.

Cr McWaters said the light near the Recreation Reserve seemed useless, but Cr Lane said it served a dozen residents.

The deed of gift of Paxton Square to the Corporation from the Hon. J. Lewis for the housing of deserving poor was read. The property is to be vested in the Hon. J. Lewis and the Mayor of the Corporation. A committee comprising the Town’s ministers, Hon. J. Lewis and the Mayor will control the property and select inmates with the power to set such a rent as is needed for maintenance and power to expel on a week’s notice without reason.

Cr McBride thought it might become a liability.

The Town Clerk said the rents were c. £70 p.a. He thought a Health Officer’s inspection would see half the cottages condemned. On taking over the property the Council would lose £13 p.a. in rates.

The council resolved to inspect the property.

The Burra Burra Coppermining Co. in liquidation advised that in future the Council would have to occupy the rubbish depot on one month’s notice as the property was for sale.

The Council resolved to buy a horse and dray and do its own scavenging. The position of scavenger is to be advertised at 9/- per day for 6 days a week.

Booborowie Railway. 100 met at Willalo Hall on Tuesday 23 March [sic] [Presumably really 23 Feb.] to confer with railway officials about the proposed line either from Hanson (23 miles) or from Yakilo Junction on the Spalding line (17 miles). The Comptroller of Accounts, John Pickering, gave figures suggesting the Hanson line would lose a small amount each year of c. £600. The Hanson route gave the better outlet to Adelaide and also to get livestock to the Burra Markets or to send hay and chaff to the north. (For this last purpose it was 100 miles better.) It is also the easier route for construction. The meeting unanimously endorsed a Hanson-Booborowie railway.

Market Square Fire, Tuesday 2 March.

About 11.30 p.m. fire destroyed the row of old buildings on the south side of Market Square owned by Walker & Sons. When the alarm was sounded by Mr Harrap all aid was given, but without a proper appliance the position was hopeless. The fire seems to have started in J. Allen’s office. G. Lord, who was one of the first on the scene, almost put out the fire in the front room with a fire extinguisher before the machine was exhausted, but the fire in the back room continued. Mr A, Walker tried another extinguisher with similar success. The fight continued with buckets, but this was inadequate and the attention had to be focused on saving Pederson & Sons’ boot shop at one end and Harrap’s pie shop at the other. The fire ran quickly along the old paling roof under the iron and was impossible to control without appliances. Pederson’s was saved by its high parapet wall and a 60’ hose was able to keep the fire from more than scorching the verandah and slightly damaging the wall.

Next to Mr Allen’s office on the other side was Walker and Sons with a stock of crockery, tinware and linoleums etc. This was practically all destroyed. Then came Mr Harrap’s private residence. This could not be saved so all the furniture was removed. Fortunately this was done with little damage, as it was uninsured. Across the 12’ right of way was the pie shop and had this caught fire it would have been impossible to save Mr W. Truscott’s butcher shop or Mr E.J. Harris’s shop. Wet bags on the roof and a hose kept the flames at bay. The crowd of workers did an excellent job despite clouds of smoke attacking those on the pie shop roof. M-C Queale supervised operations effectively. Mr Allen’s office contents were insured for £30. Also lost in it were records, guernseys etc. of the Burra Football Association and the Kooringa Football Club.

The buildings were insured for £500 and Walker & Sons’ stock for £300.

On Wednesday evening the fire started again at the rear of Mr Harrap’s residence, but was soon controlled.

There have of late been several attempts to start fires in the town:

27 Sep. 1914: at the rear of the same row

2 Oct. 1914: an attempt to burn F. Harrap’s place

26 Oct. 1914: an attempt to burn A.D. McLaren’s shop

29 Nov. 1914: another attempt to burn the buildings destroyed last week

an attempt to set fire to Clark’s Commercial Hotel which did no damage

an attempt to set fire to Mr Pizzo’s house which had been partially destroyed by a fire of known cause.

This makes clear the necessity of forming a fire brigade in the town. Had the fire occurred on the other side of the square with a favourable wind the damage could have been enormous.

No hope of putting it out and raised the alarm. The fire seemed to be right at J. Allen’s back door. The wooden place at the back of my house was not burned, though the ceiling was charred. Cannot understand its escaping. Heard no one about Tuesday night.

[There is then evidence that he and Mr Walker had talked on Wednesday about burning down this wooden room, but the matter is more clearly put in Walker’s evidence.]

John Allen:

Was in the front room of the office that night with A.D. McLaren c. 9.05 p.m. and used a kerosene lamp. We left after 10 minutes and extinguished the lamp. Passed the office c. 11.05 p.m. and saw no sign of fire. Office contents were insured for £30. It would have been possible for someone to get through the shed and through the window into my office. No idea of how the fire started. There was a drum of paint oil in the storeroom, half a tin of kerosene and 1⁄3 bottle of benzine. The floors in the front room were brick and in the two back rooms were dirt. There was no matting.

A.D. McLaren corroborated the first part of Mr Allen’s evidence.

Walter T. Truscott:

He gave evidence of the small fire that broke out the following night at the rear of Harrap’s previous dwelling among some straw envelopes in a shed there. He also gave evidence of the night of the main fire, but added little to the above.

A.L. Walker, storekeeper:

Hear the alarm c. 11.30 p.m. When I got to Dalgety’s Corner the fire was coming out of Allen’s office. Took a fire extinguisher from our drapery store to the fire. I put out the flames in the front rooms, but did not notice the flames in the back room. Before more water could be got the fire burst out again. Went to the adjoining shop. There was then no sign of fire there. Opened the back door to unlock the gate and filled a bucket with water in case fire should break out at the back. Went into the street and closed the doors. 10 minutes later re-entered our shop and found flames coming along the ceiling in the back room. Premises were insured for £500 and the stock for £300. Our financial position is good. On Wednesday night when the second fire occurred I was with M-C Queale from 6.30 p.m. to 9.00 p.m. and from 9.00 to 11.00 p.m. at my home with Mr Day. Could not replace my stock for under £500. There is no trace of fire at Allen’s back door. Thought the fire must have originated in the front of Allen’s. Was in the room at the back of Harrap’s between 7 and 8 Wednesday. Mr Crewes and Harrap and some boys were there. Harrap showed where the ceiling had been burnt a little. He put a match to the ceiling and suggested he should burn it down. I told him to stop. He said it would be better burnt because it might catch fire in the night and ignite the buildings across the lane. I said it would cost us the insurance to do so. He said it would clean the whole place up. I said he was a fool to do so. When M-C Queale sent for me at 10 o’clock there had been a fire in Harrap’s yard in the outhouse and against the washhouse.

M-C Queale:

Heard the alarm at 11.30 p.m. on 2 March and saw Allen’s place alight. The ridgepole was then burning. Tried to save Pederson’s boot shop and Truscott’s. Stayed all night watching the fire and then put on another man. Was watching again the next night as there was still some stuff smouldering at the front. Spent 10 minutes in Truscott’s and went home, returning c. 10.15 and saw people running in the lane next to Harrap’s. Found Truscott throwing water on boxes of straw and straw envelopes and noticed smoke coming from the outhouse. Paper was burning on the seat. There was no doubt an attempt had been made to cause another fire. There was no sign of fire between 6 and 9.45 p.m. On Wednesday afternoon visited the room behind Harrap’s and some paper had been burnt on top of a modern dresser and the calico ceiling had been burnt. Don’t see any connection between the burnt paper and the big fire. It seems a deliberate attempt to burn the room down. Allen’s back door looked as though it had been pulled out. The shed was not scorched. On Wednesday morning there was no sign of fire in Harrap’s back room. Don’t recall any burnt hessian in the ceiling Wednesday afternoon, but there was some in the evening. On two other occasions there have been attempts to burn these premises. Got a black-tracker up, but there was insufficient evidence for an arrest.

Harrap was recalled:

Saw fire at the back of Allen’s first. Could not understand how the shed was not burned. On the second attempt I did not say that it was a pity the whole place was not burnt down as I might have got a new shop and bakehouse.

The Mayor summed up. He thought the evidence was clear that the fire started in the front part of Mr Allen’s office; that it spread from there to the next building occupied by Walker and Sons. There had been a deliberate attempt to complete the destruction the next day, but there was no evidence to say by whom.

The jury came to the same conclusion.

Cr McBride moved that a footbridge be constructed at the Mine Bridge. Cr McWaters 2nd. Carried

The Pig and Whistle [footbridge] is to be repaired.

Some repairs will be made to the Rotunda roof.

Cr Radford moved that Bagot, Shakes and Lewis be approached to allow their yards to be used as a town pound yard.

The Mayor pointed out that such a move would involve appointing a pound-keeper and pound fees would not cover feed. The motion lapsed.

Paxton Square.

Cr McBride acknowledged the Hon. J. Lewis’s generosity, but pointed out that the present condition of the property would involve the Council in very great expense. Perhaps it would be better if it were transferred to a private trust.

The Mayor said in the first place the Council stood to lose £13-£15 p.a. in rates.

Cr Radford said the Council should have a full report from the Inspector and Health Officer to put before Mr Lewis. Carried.

A letter will be sent to Mr Lewis outlining the Council’s position.

The Mayor said it was essential that they take steps to establish a fire brigade.

Cr Lane said Kapunda had a volunteer brigade and the water pressure in Kooringa was excellent.

The Mayor said a couple of lengths of hose and a hand reel would suffice and he heard the tender for the enlarged reservoir had been let.

The Town Clerk said the Adelaide Fire Brigade estimated the cost of a reel etc. at £63.

Cr Radford suggested postponing till the annual meeting of ratepayers, when the matter could be put before them. He didn’t know where all the money would come from.

It was decided to visit Kapunda and Gawler and gather all the relevant information and report next meeting.

William E. Escott Murdered at Koonoona.

On Tuesday night last week (16 March) W.E. Escott was shot in the face through the window as he sat in his office at about 8 p.m. He staggered onto the verandah where he fell and died. At the time those at home beside the victim were his son Clement Escott and his wife, a younger son Harold Escott, and C.T. Fisher, brother of the late Mrs Escott Sen.

After the evening meal deceased went to his office and both Messrs Clement and Harold left to visit neighbours. The others remained chatting in the kitchen. When the shot rang out Mr Fisher ran into the garden, but unable to ascertain its origin he went around the front verandah. The victim was alive and tried to speak, but could not be understood before he died.

Clement Escott returned soon afterwards and then drove into Burra to report the matter. Harold Escott returned c. 11.30 p.m. M-C Queale, Dr Steele and S.M. Lane as coroner, went out to Koonoona. Detective Allchurch with M-Cs Johns and Merrett and the Black-tracker Alf Ryan came on the first rain on Wednesday.

The coroner and a jury of six inspected the body at the Burra Hospital and then went out to Koonoona with the police, arriving at 3 p.m. They surveyed the scene of the crime and the damage done by the shot gun at very close range. The tracker was soon busy. The inquest was opened at the house with the jury of F. Treloar (foreman), W. Hodge, a. O’Brien, T. McWaters, George Lord and A.J. McBride.

Clement Escott:

Son of the deceased, who would have been 70 next month, gave formal evidence of identity and the inquest then adjourned till 10 a.m. 25 March at the Burra Institute.

Christopher Fisher:

Was in the kitchen after tea with Clem Escott. Mr Escott Sen. had gone to his office. About 7.20 heard someone in the passage – not heavy steps like Mr Escott, thought it was Harold. After the shot I rushed out from the kitchen around the house to the front and found Mr Escott lying on the ground. It was very dark with no light in the office. Mrs Escott thought it was best to let him lay where he had fallen. She lit a lamp in the office and between 8 and 9 o’clock Mr Clem came home.

Clement Escott:

Left at 7.30 to go to G. Webb’s, a neighbour, about 2 miles away. Came back between 8.15 and 8.30. Turned out the horse and went to the stables to feed the draught horses before stopping the windmill and going to the house. I found the door locked and my wife asked who was there. They let me in and told me my father had been shot. I went to Mr Kelly, a mile away and brought him back, covered father with a rug and went to Burra for the police. Know of no one with a grudge against my father.

Harold Escott:

About 7.30 went to Black Springs to post letters and then to Mr McCarthy’s – 10 or 11 miles in all. Returned c. 11.30 and went to the stables to feed the buggy horses and the one I had ridden. Found the door locked and went to the kitchen, saw a light and went to the dining room and found Mr Kelly there. They told me what had happened and we waited for the police. I had been living at Echunga, but came home on 12 December and have been with the McCarthy’s for two months. Don’t think father had a cross word with anybody in the district. Have not seen any strangers about. None of us went to bed that night. About 1.30 a.m. my other sisters came from Burra. About 6 a.m. I was going to Farrell’s flat to get my other sister and asked my sister to come to my room as I wanted to get my watch and was scared. On entering the room I noticed a candle on the bed and one of my waistcoats on the floor. My watch was missing.

[Some money was also missing, but the evidence as reported is not easy to follow – perhaps £42 in notes and some coins.]

On Thursday a double-barrelled breech-loading gun was found in a 65’ shaft by the tracker Alfred Ryan, who descended by rope and recovered it.

The funeral was on Thursday 18 March in unpleasant dusty conditions.

On Monday 22 March Harold Escott was arrested for the murder of his father, William Escott Escott. The case was adjourned till 26 March and the Inquest reopens 25 March.

West Burra Copper Mine: report of the Inspector of Mines after a visit on 18 Feb. 1915.

The mine is on section 116 H. of Hanson and 31⁄2 miles SW of the Burra Mine. The main underlie shaft was sunk on the dip of the lode for 100’ and then for a further 55’ on a soft break in the country. At 53’ the lode was cut off in a fault and the displacement is not yet determined. A fair amount of driving at 100’ has not found the lode though some isolated patches have been found. Lode is well defined to 50’. Some recent driving on the lode has shown high grade ore in a fairly defined lode for 20’ when a fault is found.

The inspector goes on to suggest further driving to find the displaced lode and winze sinking to assist in locating a drive to intersect the ore at 100’. All in all he says the mine is still promising.

Patriotic Concert, Thursday 25 March.

The Belgian Bees and the Burra Hockey Girls staged a very successful concert in the Institute Hall in aid of the Belgian Relief Fund. [All prior references are to Belgium Bees. These were a specially formed group of male and female performers for this concert apparently, as the review says they have had but a short life of three weeks or so. Their inspiration seems to have come from the idea of ‘busy as a bee’ and also from the colours of the Belgian flag (red, black and yellow) which were repeated in their costumes.]

State Election. Counting of votes from last Saturday has not been completed, but so far it suggests a sweeping Labor victory with a probable majority of 6. In the early closing referendum 6 o’clock was by far the most popular time. In the Burra electorate it got 5,137 and the other hours (to 11 p.m.) together got 4,143 of which 3,174 were for 11 p.m.

For the state so far there were: 87,025 votes for 6 p.m.

64,560 for other hours, of which

52,201 were for 11 p.m.

In the Burra electorate the three Liberal candidates (Pick, Miller & O’Loughlin) were returned with majorities much like the previous election.

The Escott Murder Inquest: 25 March and continued 26 March.

S.M. Lane JP as coroner. Burra Institute.

William Clement Escott was called, but failed to appear.

Dr D. McDonald Steele:

On 17 March went to Koonoona. Body of the deceased was lying c. 3 yards from his office door. The face was covered with blood and there was considerable blood on the ground. We took the body to the office. No blackening or singeing of the face. There was a large wound on the right side above the upper lip, from which I extracted a wad. The upper jaw was smashed and the right eye completely collapsed. There were many small wounds, many minute wounds contained fragments of wire from the window screen. The injuries were consistent with a shot from the gun and cartridge produced. Death was from shock and haemorrhage. The wad penetrating the skin points to a shot from at most a few yards.

William Clement Escott:

Gave an account of his movements, essentially the same as previously reported.

James C. McCarthy, farmer of Hundred of Hanson:

Owned a double-barrelled breech-loading gun – missed it a month or five weeks ago from a trap in the buggy shed, also about five cartridges, some of them Eley’s speedites. Cartridge produced is similar. The cartridge had been knocked about and McCarthy recognised marks on it where he had had trouble extracting it from the gun in February when he had used a pocket-knife for the purpose. Harold Escott was present on the hunt on that occasion. He described features of the gun which made it highly likely to be the same one, but would not swear to its being the one. Harold Escott had been staying at their place from before New Year till sometime in February. (About 2 months) Saw Harold at my father’s on 16 March: he arrived about 9 p.m. Said he was on his way to Farrell’s flat to have the horse shod. It is about 5 miles to Escott’s from our place – it might be covered in about half an hour on a good horse.

Christopher Tennant Fisher, retired farmer, who had been living with the deceased for about 15 years:

Evidence was largely as has previously been reported. He added that if after firing the shot the person had returned to rob Harold’s room he would have run into Fisher. When Harold came home I said ‘Have you heard the news, your father is shot.’ Did not tell him he was dead and Harold did not go to see.

Alvina m. Escott, wife of W. Clement Escott:

The evidence adds little to the picture [except the possibly strange point that there was no light in the office when the body was discovered and she said there was no evidence the lamp had been alight as the glass was not hot. She had carried a light from her bedroom to light the office lamp.]

Alfred Ryan, Police Tracker:

There was a track from a galvanised iron fence to the window: a distance of about 11 paces. Someone had stood there and the tracks returned to the fence. The tracks suggest a hurrying person. The tracks went towards the stable and got lost in motor traffic, but the same tracks come from the front of the house to the stable and return. A circle round the house did not reveal tracks of a stranger. Horse tracks led from the homestead to the back road. Later he details how he tracked a horse to where the rider got off and then the tracks of the rider to a deep shaft in which he could see a gun. The horse returned to the stable and then came from it galloping. The galloping horse had gone towards Black Springs and after a while the horse stopped, rider dismounted, got back on and a mile from the homestead took a side road to a back way to the homestead. This track eventually went to McCarthy’s Farm. The tracks were those of the mousy-coloured chestnut. The tracks to the shaft were the same as those made by Harold Escott. He identified the prints in front of the window and near the shaft as those of Harold Escott.

M-C L.G.J. Merrett of Adelaide:

His evidence corroborates the movements of the tracker and his conclusions. He also made enquiries about the gun and was told the story as outlined by James McCarthy.

M-C W.J. Johns gave corroborating evidence.

M-C Queale’s evidence is largely repetitive also, but adds information about the alleged robbery from Harold Escott’s room. Miss Minnie Escott reported this about 7 a.m. on the 17 March, saying he was missing £42, a gold watch, pendant and chain and a safety razor. Asked Harold how he came to have £42. £17 was a cheque from Bagot, Shakes & Lewis, £25 was from G. Marshall in Adelaide in payment of a gambling debt (details of which are given). On the night of the murder Harold said he had ridden the mousy-coloured horse to McCarthy’s.

Mr Winnall appeared for Harold Escott and asked the courtroom be cleared of children.

Herbert Allchurch, Detective, gave parallel evidence about the tracks and the alleged robbery. Confronted with the findings of the tracker, Harold Escott made no reply. The police checked his story about the gambling debt, but could find no evidence he had sent the telegrams he had claimed to have. He then changed his story and said a man called Murphy, who was with him at the races, actually sent the telegrams. They found Murphy had sent one telegram to Marshall at a hotel. Harold Escott had said four or five telegrams had been sent to Marshall c/o P.O. Adelaide.

Harold Escott was called, but refused to answer any questions.

The jury found that Mr William Escott Escott’s death on 16 March 1915 ‘was caused by some person outside the office window. From the evidence placed before the jury we consider that person was Harold Escott.’

Mr Lane committed Harold Escott to stand trial at the next Criminal Sittings in Adelaide.

The Drought Breaks

The rainfall for 1914 was a total of 7.17”. In the first three months of 1915 the drought continued with 0.33” in January, 0.02” on February and 0.14” in March.

Then from Easter Monday we were teased with 0.13” and 0.02” on Tuesday and 0.06” on Wednesday. On Thursday there was 0.30” to 3 p.m. after which it began to pour down. Premises were flooded and all the creeks were running bankers. The flood began to be compared with the great flood of 1874 and was generally reckoned bigger. About 1.70” fell in the day and by 9 a.m. the next day 1.95” had been recorded. The flood swept away footbridges at the Burra Hotel and at the Pig and Whistle. The Commercial Hotel cellar was filling up and water was pouring through S. Burns’ shop, through Bagot, Shakes and Lewis’s Office and at E.J. Harris’s they were fending it off with brooms. A number of private bridges also went and Mrs Howell had to be carried out of her cottage.

In Aberdeen there was a lake from the railway line to the Racecourse. W.B. Page took a great photo from the railway line near the Bon Accord Hotel, with Mr Robertson’s house in the foreground and Drew & Crewes’ bulk store surrounded and a great mass of swirling water under the Bon Accord Bridge.

Robertson’s was quickly flooded. The two ladies took refuge on the window sill, feet dangling in the water, till swimming snakes made them turn around and close the window. When their predicament was noticed M-C Queale was sent for. Mr Shakes tried to get to them, but was almost swept away at the footbridge leading to the house. Mr McKeogh swam out to them. They were eventually reached from the Copperhouse side and rescued on horseback by M-C Queale, W. Field, C. Rabbich, F. Highett and Shakes. Damage to the house is estimated at £150.

Lionel Oppermann was caught trying to cross the White Hart ford by Gully’s house when a sudden wave of water washed the horses round one post of the footbridge and the lorry round another. Oppermann tried to save the horses. He managed at considerable risk to cut the harness and both horses eventually clambered out of the water. The lorry ended up in the creek opposite Walker & Sons Aberdeen shop, where it was secured by ropes. The footbridge was soon after swept away.

About 15” of water invaded A. Thamm’s.

Mrs Allen’s house was also flooded with furniture floating in the rooms. [The old Bushman’s Rest Hotel] Here it was high enough to run out of the windows, leaving cartloads of mud behind.

Drew and Crewes lost 7 cases of benzine, 31⁄2 cases of kerosene and 1 of methylated spirits, along with fencing posts, strainers and the harness and lorry at the ford.

Sara & Co had their benzine magazine flooded and their chaff shed was 3’ deep in water.

News from Mt Bryan and Hallett is scarce, but falls there were heavy. At Leighton falls were light only and at Baldina only 1.64” fell, but floodwaters came down the creek. Barker Bros lost 60 sheep and A.G. Gebhardt of Mackerode lost 40. At Hogback the flooding was severe and at King’s Well the torrent was half a mile wide and 4’ deep. Several miles of the Eastern Telephone line are washed away. Clearly much fencing has been lost. There are also further sheep losses.

Eastern rainfalls were very variable from as low as 0.35” at Glenora and 0.35” at Koomooloo to 1.64” at Baldina and 1.50” at Mongolata.

Belgian Relief Fund: £352-1-101⁄2.

There are efforts being made to organise a Belgian Flag Day – perhaps on the Monday holiday, the 2nd Monday in May and perhaps with another appearance of the Belgian Bees.

Redruth Court, 7 April.

T. Halls v. J.E.H. Winnall for defamation of character: a claim for £490 damages. The basis of the claim was that Mr Winnall on the occasion of the prosecution of Harry Mendelsohn had said that Halls ought to come into the box with clean hands. Halls took this to mean his hands were dirty and since then some friends have shunned him over the same thing. The charge failed on two counts: firstly the utterances of Mr Winnall in court were privileged and could not be the subject of a charge and secondly the words uttered meant that he should come into court free from reproach. Judgement for the defendant.

Burns v. Fairchild.

Burns sought £5-5-0, being the balance due on a roller made by him for Fairchild. This was not a standard order and the machine had to be invented from Fairchild’s description of what he wanted. He felt he had been grossly overcharged and paid £16-10-0, believing this was sufficient. The court found for Burns as no doubt now they had a roller as a pattern one could be made very much more cheaply, but the first one produced was not unreasonably much more expensive.

Belgian Guessing Competition. Guessing the number of shot in a bottle for prizes given by Archie Williams of Redruth. Miss Katie Hales of Oakbank won with 13,000. The actual number being 12,997. The winner was Bob Bettison of the Court House Hotel with 13,013.

Burra Institute.

J. Pearce won the contract for the second escape door for £29-10-0 and for work on the lantern platform for £6-17-6.

The committee considered the need for a billiard room and perhaps a gymnasium and a room for draughts, chess etc. Rev. Nield (President) was concerned that after a short while interest in each entertainment lapsed.

Obituary. Miss M. Lovell of Middleton died at Aberdeen on Sunday while coming to see the doctor. She had been visiting her sister Mrs Tester of Mt Bryan. [Born Minnie Myrtle May Mary Lovell 21 August 1895 Pt Elliot: died 18 April 1915 Aberdeen, residence Middleton.]

Inquest into the death of Miss M. Lovell by E.W. Crewes JP.

She had died either in a trap or soon after being taken into the Bon Accord Hotel. Gertrude Tester, her sister, gave evidence of symptoms of nausea, stomach pains and dysentery. She had suffered a fall from a horse at Middleton one day since Christmas.

Dr Steele had been summoned to the hotel and pronounced life extinct. The post mortem examination was not conclusive. He recommended stomach contents be sent for analysis. She was an emaciated young woman aged about 19. In the absence of other information from the stomach he would have no hesitation in giving the cause of death as diabetes.

Burra Town Council.

T. Woollacott wrote seeking permission for use of the right of way between the shop lately occupied by A.D. McLaren and Drew & Crewes, while he rebuilds McLaren’s shop and for permission to erect a verandah. Verandah permitted, but Council had no jurisdiction over the lane.

Paxton Square.

The Hon. John Lewis has received a letter from the Council stating the cottages are in a bad state of repair and although Mr Lewis’s generosity is acknowledged it will not be possible to put them into repair and maintain them from the rents. He writes to the Council pointing out that before buying them he spoke to the Council and asked if he bought them would they be prepared to take them and the answer was yes. Having no wish to burden the Council if the Council is prepared to transfer them back to him, Mr Lewis will make other arrangements.

The Town Clerk said the property had never been transferred to the Council.

Cr McBride said as Mr Lewis didn’t want to discuss the matter a re-transfer of deeds would be the simplest solution.

Cr Lane said that the members of the late Council had met with Mr Lewis. He had offered the property and said he would spend £500 in repairs and on that condition it had been accepted at the meeting, but the acceptance had never been formally ratified by Council.

A letter is to be sent to Mr Lewis explaining that Council had never officially accepted the property and that members who were present at the conference with him stated their willingness to accept on the understanding that it was to be put in repair and consequently the present Council considered the proposition now before it to be entirely different from the original one.

The mayor thought that Council should seek a further conference with Mr Lewis.

Cr Radford thought that if the buildings were condemned the Lewis trust would be liable and personally he would not like to be a member of the trust.

Cr McBride said the deeds would be in the Council’s name.

Belgian Relief Fund: £373-11-6.

Fire Brigade

This question was again discussed by Council where Cr McBride reported on the Kapunda Brigade which came under the Fire Brigade Board. The board paid 1⁄3 of the cost, insurance offices 1⁄3 and the Council 1⁄3. There were two permanent men and a horse reel. The Council contribution was £112 p.a. which was too costly for Burra. Cr Radford said a horse reel was out of the question. Cr Lane thought a hose and hydrant would be sufficient to cope in Burra. Further discussion will follow.

Burra Football Association.

Kooringa wanted the Football Association to continue.

Aberdeen was not in favour of joining if there were to be only two teams in it.

Mr Sleeman thought Aberdeen would join if a third team could be found.

Belgian Flag Day was held on Monday 10 May.

After just three weeks preparation it was a marvellous success. Shops were decorated and bunting hung out in Commercial St, Market Square and Aberdeen. The news of the sinking of the Lusitania cast a temporary gloom over the morning.

The rotunda was gay with flags and bunting and Belgian colours. One group was busy taking goods for auction from Lane’s empty shop which had been used as a depot. The weather, though cold, was bright and sunny. 28 motor cars formed the procession. [Owners are listed.] A.J. McBride’s car was judged the most appropriate, F. Custance’s was the most beautiful and I.J. Warnes’ car which was disguised as HMAS Sydney was the most original. It had a gun which fired to the thrill of young ladies and smoke issued from one of the three funnels. The Ragged Orchestra appeared on the old Mine Fire Engine – Masters Frank Howard, Reg. West, Vincent Cox, M. Cox, Clarence & Cyril Griffiths and R. Fuss. [Probably Eric Russell Fuss]

Streicher Bros lorry was a perfect imitation of a Red Cross ambulance.

The auction was due to start at 3 p.m. and the first items were the Belgian Flags signed by Lady Galway. The first went to Messrs Henry Collins & Co. for £11-11-0. J.M. McBride bought one for £10-10-0 and in all £101-17-6 was raised. 53 were sold [increased to 55 in the next paper] at prices ranging from 10/6 to 11 guineas with most fetching £1-1-0. [Including one to C. Fuss.] Other items were then auctioned.

In addition there were collecting boxes, guessing the weight of a sheep, the sale of small flags, badges etc. Total proceeds are expected to reach £270.

In the evening the concert raised a further £24 so that the eventual sum raised on the day would be c. £300.

Rev. J.H. Nield was farewelled at a service on Wednesday evening, followed by supper. The proceedings were reported in over 11⁄3 columns.

Theft. A sneak thief stole a Union Jack from S.M. Lane’s after Belgian Flag Day and four boys whose names are known were seen pulling down decorations in the street. If Mr Lane’s valuable flag is not returned action will be taken.

Burra Cheer-up Society.

When the first volunteers left they were accorded an enthusiastic send-off and public recognition. Since then the return of volunteers on their final leaves has been in ones and twos and this, together with the frequency of it, has meant no public recognition for most. It was decided a Cheer-up Society would provide a permanent group to take action whenever and as often as necessary. Mr Frank Harris and Miss Trix Pearce convened a meeting for this end last Saturday in the Lodge Room and 26 ladies and 10 gentlemen attended. [They are named.] The Mayor took the chair.

The Adelaide Cheer-up Society was there to be emulated. Mrs Seager, founder of the Adelaide Society, suggested a kind of club where the boys would be at home, and that entertainments be arranged.

Mr Lane moved the foundation of the Society & Miss G. Pearce 2nd.

The mayor was elected President with Trix Pearce as Hon. Sec. And Ethel James as Assistant Hon. Sec. Mr F. Harris is Treasurer.

What Burra has Done and Is Doing for the European War.

£286-11-3 has been raised for the Patriotic Fund, of which £80 was sent to the Prince of Wales’ Fund. The balance is being held to aid any of our boys who become wounded and disabled. The committee is considering ways of augmenting the fund.

A local branch of the Red Cross was formed. Large numbers met for months to prepare clothing, bandages and other requisites for the wounded soldiers. The sum of £70 was also collected.

Belgian Relief Fund. Various efforts to raise money for the sufferings of the Belgian refugees and Belgians at home were made, culminating in Belgian Flag Day. This brought out the largest crowd ever seen in Market Square and visitors said it exceeded even Adelaide in its procession etc. The sale of flags raised over £100. Sale of a fat sheep over £20 and the concert over £25. With the auction of goods the taking on the day were c. £300. The Belgian Fund has now raised £800, of which £720 has been sent to Lady Galway and the committee is aiming for £1,000. Several cases of useful clothing have also been despatched.

A Cheer-up Society has been formed and almost all the young ladies and many married women joined. They meet several times a week, knitting and making garments for our boys at the front and in camp.

Including money subscribed directly to funds in Adelaide as well as locally it is estimated that over £3,000 has been donated in cash from Burra and also large quantities of apparel and medical necessities.

The greatest contribution has been about 110 of our young men.

In addition for the district Leighton, Mt Bryan and Booborowie have subscribed largely to the Patriotic and Belgian Funds

We have just heard that numbers of wounded are now returning and a call has gone out for bedding, pyjamas and other clothing.

Our Soldiers’ Aid Society

A meeting was called 31 May at Jubilee Hall to decide how best to assist our wounded. The meeting was convened by Rev. J.C. Jennison and Mr C. Bartholomæus and chaired by E.W. Crewes.

The Mayor thought that the Government ought to be providing the basic necessities such as blankets etc. and that Burra donations were extensive. The Cheer-up Society and the Red Cross were already in the field so he was unsure what the convenors had in mind. If they were thinking of another branch of either society he thought that divided efforts were not always the best, though he admitted that the distance to walk to attend meetings in Kooringa was a factor.

Cr Radford said that blankets etc. would doubtless be provided, but that for items like pyjamas ladies could make them at half the cost. He moved the formation of ‘Our Soldiers’ Aid Society’ with the aim of rendering such aid to soldiers wounded or on active service as was deemed necessary. He envisaged pyjamas, slippers, sheets and possibly patchwork quilts. When convalescent temporary homes might be required and light work. Also little luxuries like bacon, eggs etc might be sent to hospitals. He felt that Aberdeen needed its own organisation. By the time ladies carried their machines etc. to Kooringa they would be out of breath. There was no sense of opposition to Kooringa.

Mrs Killicoat would provide afternoon tea at 3d a head to cover the cost of material.

If the committee so desired they would offer Abberton Park for the duration as a convalescent hospital – it could accommodate 25-30 beds. Burra could equip it and offer it to the authorities complete, but for the nurses and medical comforts.

The motion to form the society was carried.

Rev. J.C. Jennison nominated Mrs Bloyd for President. Mrs Bartholomæus was elected Vice-President, Mrs Frank Sara became Secretary and Mr Guy Tiddy was elected Treasurer. Mr C. Fuss moved membership be 1/- for ladies and 2/6 for gentlemen. Lieut. Killicoat’s offer of Abberton Park was accepted in principal and the authorities are to be informed of it. The Methodist Church trustees offered Jubilee Hall free for all meetings. Subscriptions so far are £9-3-6.

Sergeant Wheatley writes from Mena, Egypt, dated 8 Feb. 1915. They expected to be involved in the fighting along the Suez Canal, but so far had not moved. At Sunday church parade Wheatley conducted the massed bands. Afterwards he and several other sergeants dined with a local sheik (Head of a Village). They rode donkeys to a house about 2 miles away. They dined in a large room with a long table and were waited on by servants in long brightly coloured silk robes. They were served a dish of quail, then turkey, rice rolled in lettuce leaves, then skinless sausages. They were then almost full, having had whisky and cigarettes between dishes. The meal ended with stewed fruits and nuts and a big dish of something with nuts floating in it. The host did not eat with them, but afterwards.

Mr Warnes also attacked the Burra Racing Club for not paying its secretary. Perhaps it is time the Racing Club had another meeting to take action to write off its debt.

N. Hiles Pearse wrote to the Burra Council from ‘Corra Lin’ Florieton 2 June.

The family is grieving the death of his brother, Bert Pearse, and he writes suggesting Burra have a memorial to those of the Burra volunteers who fall in action. Such a thing could be done inexpensively and we would be willing to give £5-5-0 or more if required. ‘It is the least we can do for our brave lads who fall in a foreign country, away from their own kin, to be buried in unknown graves.’

Mr Crewes’ thoughts turned to the South African War Memorial in Adelaide, though not on so large a scale of course.

Cr Killicoat thought it a good idea.

A statue had been erected in Jamestown with respect to the South African War, though unfortunately the wording made it sound as if the lads had been killed by the people of Jamestown.

Though a bit early, perhaps it was not too soon to start a subscription list.

It was resolved that the Council arrange for a memorial.

Souvenir of the War.

A large meeting of the combined Patriotic Committees was held in the Council Chamber on Thursday to consider a souvenir book of the war. Mr Crewes couldn’t see how anything could be done till the war was over. The cost was also a problem. He thought that with illustrations it would be c. £100. Cr Lane was strongly for the project.

E.J. Harris said it was necessary to gather the information for the publication as the war went on.

Cr Radford said if anything were premature the monument was. He thought there ought to be a committee to gather information and photos with the idea of publishing when the time came. He believed it would pay for itself.

A motion to collect information and prepare for publication at the end of the war was passed. A committee of seven was elected comprising the Mayor and Messrs Page, Marston, Winnall, Johnson, & Crs Lane and Radford. Mr Page to be secretary.

Redruth Court 20 June.

The Kotz v. Kielow case continued. Adolph Alfred Kotz, father of the complainant, gave evidence he had seen the incident. Theodor Kotz, aged c. 11 corroborated the evidence as did Clara Kotz, aged 9.

Mr Winnall, for the defence, asked for a dismissal on the grounds that the informant’s evidence had been most unsatisfactory and had been considerably corrected. The evidence of the so-called witnesses was clearly unreliable. They claimed to have heard a conversation at 350 yds. Only one shot from the gun had touched the informant and it was reasonable to believe it was not direct but had dropped onto the informant’s shoulder. The bench thought there was a case to answer. The accused did not desire to give evidence. Augusta Pauline Kielow gave evidence with a different version of the shots and said there were shot marks in her son’s hat that had not been there in the morning. Eventually the case was dismissed with each side to pay its own costs.

Obituary. Mr W.S. Thomson, the manager of the National Bank died suddenly on 21 June. He was recovering from severe gastritis, but collapsed in the street while talking to Dr Ashton who was visiting Burra. The latter at once sent for Dr Steele and the patient was sent to hospital, but died two hours later from a cerebral haemorrhage. He was aged 54 and had been manager in Kooringa for c. 5 years. He came to SA about 32 years ago from Scotland. At his death he was Vice-President of the Institute. He leaves a wife, three sons and one daughter. Mr M. Thomson is gaining station experience in the North, Charles is in the bank at Gladstone and George is fighting in the Dardanelles. [Wyville Smythe Thomson.]

Letter from ‘Britisher’, Kooringa, 15 June, complaining that the Burra District Council gave a tender to a ‘German councillor’s son in preference to the Britisher on the ground that the lowest tenderer had no horses, at the same time he would have employed a man that had a team and had to struggle to feed them as well as the councillor.’

[The last phrase reads oddly, but the general tenor of the complaint is both clear and typical of the time.]

W.B. Martin writes from Thames in New Zealand saying his family arrived in Burra in 1848 and left in 1862 to move to the Wallaroo Mines and then in 1872 went to New Zealand. His father was Martin Martin, who sang in the Bible Christian Choir. He remembers people in Burra named Killicoat, Drew, Lane and Truscott. The writer is Bill, Martin’s eldest son. When the family arrived in Burra the creek was full of big gum trees and most people lived in the creek. I was playing with Joe Reed when he went to wash his hands in the creek and the bank crumbled. He fell in and drowned. Remember two men, Prior and Johns, I think, who suffocated in the mine. My wife was born at Kooringa on 11 October 1846, her father was Samuel Gribble and he left Burra about 68 years ago. There were 14 in our family, of whom four survive: a sister in Broken Hill, Mrs Simons in Aberdeen, a brother in Wallaroo and I. We have just celebrated our Golden Wedding and have 21 grandchildren and 7 great grandchildren.

Utica Copper Mine: inspected 19 May. Six miles south east of Burra.

Recent work has been confined to the 100’ level of the underlie shaft. 31 feet in on the SW crosscut a winze in the lode has been sunk 17’, yielding about 4% copper. The engine for pumping water out at this level makes it hot and unfit for men to work. Nothing more will be done here till this improves. A half mile east an underlie shaft is down 60’ in ore of 5% to 1% copper. 90’ east of this there is a shaft 65’ deep from former exploration some years ago and this will be further explored.

West Burra Copper Mine: inspected 19 May.

The main underlie shaft is at 100’ and driving extends a total of 18’. One vein 3-6” wide is fair, but the rest of the formation is low grade. The drive east meets a fault after 16’ and the ore body beyond has not been located. At 50’ the east drive hasn’t found anything while the west drive at 42’ is more promising. A winze from here to the 100’ level is to be dug. The indications on the west side at both the 100’ and 50’ look promising. The seam in the 50’ west drive is 15” wide and gave 34-36% copper.

Burra Show Society. Meeting last Friday with I.J. Warnes in the chair.

The committee for the Sheep Dog Trials decided to allow dogs in the Novice Class to compete for the Championship Cup because this was allowed by the Strathalbyn Rules. This was against a resolution of the Burra Agricultural [Show] Society, which barred them. The committee also decided on one judge for the day when the annual meeting had decided on two. Mr Warnes believed the committee was bound by the resolutions of the AGM. The committee held that such resolutions were recommendations only.

Mr Warnes held they were wrong, but even if it were so they would have to report back to the Burra Show Soc. And when the committee decided to go on with the program he decided to call the present meeting. Since then the card from the Strathalbyn Society showed that only Open Class dogs competed in the Championship.

After a long and at times heated discussion it was resolved that the lines on which the Championship was decided at Strathalbyn should be strictly adhered to at Burra.

The secretary was inclined to resign. He said if the President and not Mr Radford had been in the chair at the time there would have been no trouble.

Bob Voumardt, well-known local drover has had a run of bad luck this year, losing dogs to the value of £70 to cars, poisoning and distemper. On Saturday week last he lost most of his camp equipment when his tent blew onto the fire while he was out checking the sheep. He narrowly saved the dray which was beginning to burn. His loss here was c. £50.

Fire. At the pictures on Saturday night at the Institute someone seems to have deliberately set fire to the scenery. It was discovered before it did much damage, but it did cause people to leave the hall, fortunately without panic.

Violet Day in Burra.

The day was set aside to commemorate the fallen and to raise funds for a home or club for the wounded and incapacitated. Up to now the Burra Cheer-up Society had sent away about £100 worth of goods, had £25 worth in hand and had farewelled departing soldiers. Mr Crewes called for a fresh application for the cause to be funded by Violet Day. He gave a stirring speech to rouse the patriotism of the locals. Mr Winnall then spoke of the sacrifice of the men in the Dardanelles and how those at home should be willing to make sacrifices in turn. I.J. Warnes said Leighton would unite with the Burra Cheer-up Society to make a common fund. W.G. Hawkes spoke of the volunteers in the loftiest of terms and of an empire based on magnanimity, justice and truth. Following this series of dramatic and impassioned speeches a bunch of violets was sold on the Bugler system. Trix Pearce reported on what followed.

It is the intention of the Cheer-up Society to build a club in Adelaide where wounded soldiers can go when they please. Burra is glad to assist in this aim. In Burra the aim was to sell violets, violet ribbons with a cross, and ‘in memory’ printed on them and programs for the day. Unfortunately the ribbons never arrived, but the flowers and programs sold rapidly. At 3 p.m. businesses closed and the Mayor, E.W. Crewes, and Messrs Winnall, Hawkes and Warnes addressed the large crowd at the rotunda. Mr O’Brien of Dalgety & Co. then proceeded to sell a modest bunch of violets by the Bugler system. The bidding was marvellous and soon totalled the sum of £243. When Mr I.J. Warnes finally bought the bunch for £5-2-6. But after that voluntary contributions continued to roll in and the final price was £382-2-0. Other proceeds for the day brought the total raised to £414. The buyers’ names are listed.

Soldiers’ Aid Society.

The society is growing and meetings are well attended. A large parcel of goods is ready to be sent and sufficient is retained to equip Abberton Park as a convalescent hospital if needed. Mr Morton’s Bible Class social raised 10/6. Seven little girls from Hampton gave a concert there and raised 12/6. The Society will provide luncheon for the sheep dog trials. Mr Jesser will give his billiard hall for one Saturday afternoon.

So far the fund is £25-10-41⁄2.

The Premier has sought co-operation in making Australia Day a success on 30 July.

The aim of the day is to raise money for the wounded and their dependants and for incapacitated nurses. At present the fund had £24,000 and their aim was for £100,000.

Cr McWaters said that 30 July had been set for the sheep dog trials.

Guy Tiddy for the Soldiers’ aid Society suggested that the military authorities be approached to let all Burra boys return at the same time for a public farewell.

Cr Killicoat thought that it might be arranged.

Cr Redford said it was vital every soldier get a public farewell. ‘Young Camp, the first who died, left without any.’

Mr Crewes said the 1st twenty-three who went did so in twos and threes making it impossible. He had communicated with the military authorities.

Messrs McLaren, Treloar, G. Lord, O’Brien and Dower waited on Council re the relocation of the bridge from the back of the Burra Hotel.

It was the shortest route from the corner of Paxton Square and buyers [at the saleyards] were inconvenienced by the lack of it. A number of ratepayers had also objected to its removal. It had served well for 40 years. The site upstream would not be as convenient for the saleyards or the Recreation Ground.

The Mayor said he had received expressions of directly opposite views and after much discussion the Council had decided on the Institute site.

Cr Radford said there was vandalism destroying street lamps in Aberdeen. One was down and another saved in the nick of time. Police are to be informed.

Patriotic Meeting at Farrell’s Flat

A meeting at Farrell’s Flat on Saturday night to consider celebrating Australia Day was addressed by E.W. Crewes and Mr Winnall.

Mr Crewes gave a stirring patriotic speech and was proud to come from Burra where, with only 1,750 people they had raised over £1,500 and sent 128 men to the front. On Violet Day they had raised £414. Gawler had managed £45 and Adelaide £750.

Mr Winnall followed.

[The patriotic enthusiasm and the claiming of the moral high ground for Burra backfired on this occasion however, and Mr Bartlett, no doubt expressing views shared by others, took offence at the implication that Farrell’s Flat had not done its bit and also at the fact that Burra’s catchment area for donations extended to within two miles of Farrell’s Flat, where a man giving £20 to the Burra Fund would have had more credit if he had donated it locally.]

Mr Winnall apologised if he had trodden heavily on somebody’s corns. He had no thought of belittling the town.

But this did not quite quell the situation.

Mr Denton moved a vote of thanks to the speakers and said while Mr Bartlett had taken what was said in the wrong way, the Mayor must have known that a portion of Violet Day money had come from the Hanson District and it would hurt people’s feelings to have it all claimed for Burra.

Mr Crewes then said he was sorry he came and took Mr Denton’s remarks as an insult. Some of his friends lived in Farrell’s Flat and he would not travel there to insult them. If he had said anything to hurt their feelings he apologised.

A committee was then formed to organise Australia Day at Farrell’s Flat, but by that time anything said was interpreted as an insult by one side or the other and the meeting was adjourned.

One result of the above meeting was that Mr Ley, as Chairman of the District Council, who had invited the Mayor and Mr Winnall, grew so disgusted by the attitudes of the ratepayers as expressed at the meeting that he resigned as Chairman of the District Council and has since refused to change his mind.

Burra Cheer-up Society

The Hon. J. Lewis has loaned a piano to the Society for the duration.

Mr Pearce has had acetylene gas lighting installed in the room.

Letter from ‘One Who Cares’ urging the cancellation of dancing at the Institute and the playing of football ‘while this horrible war is raging’. The editor comments that on Monday night the Institute committee prohibited dancing until after the war.

Letter from I.J. Warnes, defending his stand on the fracas over the Burra Field Dog Trials.

Letter from M.A. Radford on the same subject.

[For anyone interested in the whole thing this letter is perhaps the most clearly articulated outline of the dispute and sets out the chronological sequence of events and explains how it all came about in fairly dispassionate terms. Nevertheless some of the statements about who said what are at the core of the matter and these remain in dispute as shown in a letter in the next issue.]

Burra Institute Committee

Mr McLaren elected Vice-President for the rest of the year to replace Mr Thomson, deceased. Subscribers number 120. The committee discussed the issue of dancing for the duration of the war and decided to ban it in the hall. Six subscribers and the committee then considered the desirability of a billiard room. Three schemes were considered:

A room 18’ x 45’ with one table, costing £460 (Though costs have risen sharply since this costing was done.)

A room for two tables with the building and table to cost £570

(The third option does not seem to be reported in the paper.)

Terowie seems to be the only Institute to run a billiard room successfully from the four written to.

Mr Lane moved that with building materials so costly and the time inopportune, the matter stand over till after the war. Mr Wilkinson 2nd.

Given the general lack of response from subscribers the motion was carried.

Rev. F.H. Durnford has been appointed Chaplain with Australian troops and received only 24 hours notice to join them. A farewell social was hastily arranged in St Mary’s Schoolroom on Wednesday evening last. Rev. Bloyd and Mr Winnall spoke and so did Mr Treloar, Mr Page and Mr Crewes. Mr Durnford made a suitable response. He left on Thursday morning’s train.

Australia Day.

The combined patriotic committees met on 13 July to arrange for Australia Day on the 30 July.

The money raised is to supplement the pensions of returned soldiers.

A decorated motorcar procession was agreed upon. The Burra Automobile Club was asked to help and the Burra Band to play selections in the afternoon. It was resolved that an auction sale be held in the afternoon and a large silk flag of the Commonwealth, 6’ x 3’ signed by Lady Munro-Ferguson [wife of the Governor General] to be offered on the day by the Bugler system, to go in the end to the highest aggregate bidder – also 50 silk Australian flags signed by the Governor – or by the Governor General if his signature was obtainable. The ladies to provide afternoon tea. A concert to be held in the evening in the Institute. Various committees were established to organise the above.

Burra Cheer-up Society. Visit of Mrs Seager.

Mrs Seager, organiser of the Cheer-up Society visited Burra on Wednesday. The Mayor introduced the visitor. The President of the society, Mr Sowden apologised for his absence. Mrs Seager came not to solicit fresh funds, but to thank Burra for the money and packages already sent and specifically as the result of Violet Day. Mr Winnall asked for clarification on how the funds were to be expended and how Australia Day and Violet Day were differentiated.

Australia Day funds would go towards supplementary pensions for the wounded and helping their dependants and providing light employment.

Violet Day raised money for the Cheer-up Home which was a place the returned wounded could visit at any time when they were discharged. Many coming from all parts of the state had nowhere to go and this provision was important for them. They also found a lack of utensils at the camp and the Keswick Hospital was not well equipped and the funds helped there. Burra had supplied over 100 beds. The Government had supplied some land for the building.

In the evening of Mrs Seager’s visit we also farewelled two more Burra boys: Ptes J. Kellaway and Stagg. Mr Crewes presided.

Mrs Seager suggested Burra and Leighton branches provide the soldiers with a luncheon on Australia Day.

On July 17 an inscribed bugle was presented to Lieut. Stevenson’s battalion from Burra Cheer-up Society.

Some 30 dozen handkerchiefs have now been sent from here.

Pte Bruce regretted he could not attend the social.

Monday we had a send-off for Pte Lance Tiver.

Burra Show Society met on Friday for a general meeting to consider holding a show in 1915. The committee recommended reducing prize money to £200 and members volunteered to do the carting of exhibits from the railway station, saving £20-£30.

Mr Radford moved an amendment that it be held. 2nd Mr Flower.

Mr Winnall was for the motion and Mr A.D. McDonald was for the amendment as were Mr Harcus, Mr Warnes, Mr Hodge and Mr Duldig. The amendment was carried 13 to 12.

The date settled on was 21 October.

Re the Dog Trials it was resolved that four dogs from the open class be taken to compete for the Championship.

Letter from Isaac J. Warnes seeking clarification of whether the proposed War Memorial is for Burra or Burra District. If the latter then other local government bodies should have been consulted. In any case the move is as yet premature and could lay up money for years that could be put to better use.

Recruiting. A meeting was held on Monday evening to form a recruiting committee for Burra. Dr Steele thought it should be pushed vigorously. He was trying to go himself and on two or three occasions had almost lined up a locum and only on Saturday had a letter from one who had now decided to go himself. The mayor mentioned a strapping young fellow, out of work, whose parents would not let him go. A demonstration has been arranged for the 1st anniversary of the war on 4 August.

Farewell to Our Boys. The Institute was practically full on Saturday at 3 p.m. for a farewell to another batch of our volunteers. E.W. Crewes presided. Since the inception of the Burra Cheer-up Society no volunteer has left without a gathering to wish him well. Rev. Bloyd spoke after Mr Crewes. Mr Winnall then made an impressive speech and Lieut. McBride responded. Lieut. Kidman, as a visitor, also spoke briefly.

[Strangely the volunteers are neither numbered nor named.]

Letter from Sgt R. Woollacott, France, 1 June 1915, with more about Burra than the war or France. Another is dated 6 June when he was back with his battalion, having come up to the front by train from Le Havre. He was then about 8 miles from the front.

Letter from Horace Oates at Mitcham, dated 24 July. He was there in camp where about 3,000 were housed 12 to a tent or 60 to a hut. The ground he says is hard, but the food was good. They get plenty of drill and there is a ‘bird cage’ for the incorrigibles.

Letter from Eric Roach from the Dardanelles, dated 9 June. He tells of the difficulties of writing with a lack of paper, and of the landing at Anzac Cove. He got wounded when a bullet went through his shoulder and into his neck. He spent three weeks on a hospital boat and then went to Alexandria and Malta before returning to Gallipoli.

Burra Cheer-up Society report on the farewell to the volunteers. This report lists them as: Lieut McBride, & Privates James, C.A. Brown, Wahlert, Wilson, Bowman, G.A. Brown, Field, Lowe, B. Collins & Nicholls along with Lieut. Kidman (a visitor). Pte Niemann could not attend. We thank Mr E.J. Harris for allowing us the use of his crockery free of charge and J.T.P. Johnson for use of a copper.

M.A. Radford responds briefly to his critics, but sneers at the use of a nom-de-plume.

Advt. Centenary of Australian Methodism. Thanksgiving services in the Kooringa Methodist Church 8 august. Dr H.T. Burgess from Adelaide will preach. On 10 August public tea at 5.30 p.m. and meeting at 7.45 p.m. with an address by Dr Burgess.

Notice. Dr Ashton has established a temporary surgery in premises next door to Lord’s Hotel.

Obituary. George Kemble, aged 64 yrs 11 months died 29 July at Baldina, leaving a widow, four sons, and three daughters. He was a very old resident of Douglas who was born at Cherry Gardens near Adelaide and worked in this district first as a station hand. 40 years ago he took up land at Douglas. Among children are Mrs A. Woodman of Kooringa and Messrs D. & H. Kemble of Burra. [Death registered as at Douglas.]

Fred Moxam of Parcoola was farewelled on 26 July at Old Koomooloo before going into camp.

Dr Ashton, formerly of Burra, has purchased the practice of the late Dr J.I. Sangster and has resumed work here. Pending the erection of a house and surgery in Commercial Road Dr Ashton has fitted up a temporary surgery in the premises recently occupied by Mr J.T. Hartnett, next door to the Burra Hotel.

Australia Day was held in Burra last Friday.

The weather, which had been threatening, turned out to be ideal. A team spent the morning decorating Market Square. An afternoon tea tent was erected at the northern end of the square and at the south end was T.P. Hall’s pie-stall, lent for the day to another group of ladies. In front of the rotunda were the articles to be auctioned. The procession began approximately at 2.30 p.m. from Redruth. It was headed by the police Cpl McCarthy and M-C Queale, then the Light Horse, Citizen Forces, Cadets under Lieut. Killicoat, Burra Coronation Band under Conductor Bentley, Burra Rifle Club under Captain Lord, Burra School Children under Mr Johnson, Copperhouse children under Mr Mazzarol, a large number of vehicles and 20-30 cars, the Kazoo-tin-can Band and the Copper Escort of small boys dressed in brilliant uniforms and carrying battle-axes and swords.

A.J. McBride’s car was judged most artistic; Mrs Barker’s car in wattle blossom and gold streamers was much admired. Dr Steele’s car was most appropriate: a boat-shaped frame carried samples of state recruiting posters. R.M. McBride Jun.’s car ‘was got up as a blackfellows’ wirley and was said to be from Oodnadatta’. The tin-can band was organised by Mr Hann and consisted of about 40 boys in black faces and patched costumes with jam-tin hats and kerosene-tin drums. At the rotunda Mr Crewe’s made another stirring appeal.

The Auction. Bidding for the flag signed by Lady Munro-Ferguson opened with Mr Tennant’s bid of £200 and W.G. Hawkes had a bid of £50. The highest bid of the day got the flag and bidders of £25 or more got a smaller one signed by Her Excellency. Bidders of £1-1-0 got a small flag signed by Sir Henry Galway.

The bidding for the flag brought in the amazing sum of £1,600.

Sheep Dog Field Trials, 30 & 31 July

Novice Stakes won by Mr White’s black and tan Koonoona Jack who penned in 133⁄4 minutes.

Puppy Stakes won by Willie Wade’s Logie-’o-Buchan

Open Class won by Mr A. Collins’s black, yellow and white dog Rap, getting maximum of 100 points and penning in 12 minutes.

The Championship Cup of SA was also won by Rap with another perfect score.

Letter from ‘Loyalty’ who takes exception to remarks of two of the speakers farewelling volunteers on 24 July, one of whom said

‘There ought not to be one able-bodied man in the hall who had not volunteered.’

And another said ‘all those physically fit who do not go are called the cold foot brigade’.

But some must stay behind as indicated in a cutting from the Register of 22 July.

The point made there was that the biggest harvest yet in Australia is on the way and men are needed to gather it in and farmer numbers are so depleted. Harvesting food for the nation is serving the country as faithfully as he who goes to the front.

Letter from ‘Supporter’ continuing the squabble over the Sheep Dog Trials. Also did Mr Radford say recently ‘men that are going now are not half as worthy of a social as others who have gone and those who go later should get no send-off at all’?

Why does Mr Radford stay at home?

‘Our roads are in good order now and our ratepayers may possibly be induced to give Cr Radford leave of absence for a few months.’

Letter from ‘Dog Owner’ noting Mr Warnes failed to thank Mr Killicoat for providing the sheep or Mr McBride for presenting a trophy at the Sheep Dog Trials. Was this because both were on the much-abused committee? But why was Mr George Melrose not thanked for presenting a medal. It is time Mr Warnes ‘climbed off his perch’.

Burra Town Council

The Commissioner of Crown Lands has offered to build three bridges in Burra for £400 each if the Council will pay half.

Cr McBride said the offer was absurd.

The Council had £150 and he suggested the Department be asked for the other £150.

The matter will be taken up with the local members.

The Aberdeen Bridge certainly did not need £400 spent on it.

Eventually it was decided to ask for a £600 special grant.

Kooringa has been brought under the Public Amusements Act.

Aberdeen will get private post boxes, but none are presently in stock.

Obituary. Mary Anna Snell, aged 81, wife of the late Richard Snell, died at her daughter’s residence in Kooringa on 8 August. She was born near Truro, Cornwall in 1834 and arrived with her father, the late Henry Bishop in 1848 and her uncle the late Richard Boundy, afterwards a captain at the Burra Mine. They came straight to Burra. In 1852 she married Richard Snell and they went to the Victorian goldfields and they then lived in various places: Avoca, Daylesford, and Castlemaine, before returning to Burra in 1877. They lived here until Mr Snell died in 1906. In 1910 Mrs Snell moved to Saddleworth for four years before returning to Burra. The surviving children are: Messrs Frederick Snell (Saddleworth), John Snell (Westbourne Park), Mrs J. Hocking (Yackanandah Vic.), Mrs H. Young (Long Plains), and Mrs F.J. Carey (Kooringa). [Born Mary Ann Bishop.]

Accident. Cr T. McWaters was shocked and bruised when a car driven by Clem McWaters turned on its side in a creek crossing due to its tyre coming off.

St Mary’s special service for the fallen last Sunday night had a small attendance due to the heavy rain which also prevented the Rev. Bloyd from getting back. The service was taken by Mr Letheby.

Dr Burgess preached at the Kooringa Methodist Church on Sunday in connection with the centenary of Methodism in Australia. Wet weather kept numbers down somewhat, but £50-10-0 was collected.

West Burra Coppermining Co. 4th half-yearly report, 28 July, Burra Institute.

Messrs A.J. McBride, George Lord and Thomas McWaters were re-elected as directors. (The other directors are S.M. Lane and C.B. Warnes.)

Work has continued and though little ore has been sent away the three tons processed gave encouraging results, assaying at 27% copper. In six months 158’ of driving and 34’ of sinking was done at 30/- per foot. Western drives now extending at the 50’ and 100’ levels. The company is in credit £630 following the issuing of the 5,000 shares held in reserve. The directors took 2,330 of them, showing their confidence in the venture.

Railway Accident at Burra Station.

On Friday evening the Broken Hill Express was accidentally run onto the wrong line and into a rake of cattle trucks. The sound of the collision was heard for two miles. Luckily the driver applied the brakes promptly and the cattle train locomotive was not attached. There were no serious injuries, though some passengers were bruised and one lady was cut on the head. The engine passed halfway through a combination passenger and luggage van, smashed two cattle trucks and more or less damaged a score of others. The roof of the van enclosed the engine up to the cabin and the smoke stack of the locomotive was lying some distance back along the line. Some of the buffers on passenger carriages were also damaged. It was fortunate that the cattle train was able to move somewhat and so absorb part of the force of the collision. It seems the points were set right by one official and another, unaware of that changed them back. The system in use is said to be absolutely out of date and considering the line’s traffic it is time a more modern one was in place.

Red Cross Bazaar at the Institute last Friday.

The weather was about as bad as possible, but despite that c. £200 was raised. Mr Crewes introduced Mrs Hawker of ‘Bungaree’ to open the bazaar. Her speech and descriptions of the stalls etc. extend for c. 11⁄4 columns.

J.E.H. Winnall advises the Council is entitled to the rates from Paxton Square while acting as trustee for the property.

J.B. Griffiths is appointed lamp lighter in Aberdeen until the end of November.

There are complaints re the lamp lighting in Kooringa, but nothing was resolved.

A petition was presented asking for the footbridge, formerly behind the Burra Hotel, to be re-erected opposite the Institute.

There was another bridge only a few yards from the hotel and it was not desirable for schoolchildren to go through the back premises of a hotel. There were 92 signatures.

The Mayor said they had already resolved to erect the bridge opposite the Institute and he could not say whether that would be altered in view of the two contrasting petitions now received, but both would be considered.

Utica Copper Mining Co. Half-yearly meeting in the Institute on Wednesday last.

After beginning a winze at the 100’ level the prospect was poor and after a few feet it was abandoned. The capital is down to £136. We consider it would be unwise to spend any more money in exploration. The liabilities of the company are:

To the Government £208-0-0

To Horwood & Co. £37-6-4

£245-6-4

In the last six months William West resigned as secretary and E.J. Davey was appointed at £20 p.a. The office has moved to the Burra Institute (£10 p.a.)

Messrs Horwood have offered £110 for the engine. We advise acceptance if you approve total cessation of work. The directors intend to call a shareholders’ meeting soon to consider winding up or reconstructing the company.

Redruth Court, 19 August.

Benjamin Gully was charged with having possession of two fowls reasonably believed to have been stolen. [From Mr W. Short.]

W.J. Short missed two fowls from his yard on 12 August, out of 22. The door had been opened and tracks of a man were seen. Reported to police and on Wednesday he believed he saw his fowls at the defendant’s. But when the police arrived could only find one of them. William Thomas gave evidence he kept fowls and had missed three on Tuesday: the door had been broken and the thief had left tracks.

On Wednesday he went with the police and identified two he believed were his.

T.A. Gregg, licensee of the Bon Accord Hotel similarly identified one of two fowls he had missed.

The accused stated he was a labourer at the quarry earning 9/- a day. He had lost only two weeks work in the last 12 months. Until six weeks ago he had lived with his mother, 500 yards away. He swore he owned all the fowls and geese and gave details of how he identified them etc. He did not claim the speckled hen: [which had been identified by Gregg] it had joined his fowls, having been loose in the paddock. His fowls are sometimes mixed with Rule’s as there is no fence between the places.

Edith Gully, wife of the accused, corroborated his story.

Mr Hann for Gully would have called Mrs Gully Sen., ‘but unfortunately, that lady suffered with her heart and they were afraid that if she were put into the box there would be an explosion.’

The accused had been charged with having two fowls in his possession, but evidence having been tendered about four the information was bad and the case was dismissed.

Obituary. Mrs Annie McWaters, wife of Cr McWaters of Burra Town and District Councils, died on 25 August, suddenly at Kooringa, aged 62, of heart failure.

She was born in Devonshire in 1853 and came to Australia with her parents Mr & Mrs Farrow in the Ilatanic and resided in Burra a number of years before marrying Mr McWaters in 1872. They went to live at Leighton. After two years they moved to a farm at World’s End, retiring to Burra after about 40 years (about 2 years ago). The surviving family are: Mrs Irlam (WA), Mrs Inman (Broken Hill), Mrs Hewitt (Sydney), Misses Florence and Dulcie (Burra), Messrs Steward McWaters (Penola), William Hedley McWaters (World’s End) and Clement M. McWaters (Kooringa). [Born Anne Luscombe Farrow 28 October 1853 Devonshire.]

Burra Show Society. A general meeting was called last Wednesday to decide whether the withdrawal of the Government subsidy this year should influence the holding of the show. It has been learned that Saddleworth, Tarlee and Kapunda will not hold a show this year, but that shows at Clare, Petersburg, Balaklava, Gawler, Jamestown and Eudunda were going ahead. Gawler expected to be very successful because of the cancellation of the Royal [Adelaide] Show. Clare’s prizes were down 15%.

Mr Winnall remained opposed to holding a show. He moved the suspension of standing orders to allow the decision to hold a show to be rescinded.

Mr Crewes opposed the motion. Surely, he said, the removal of a £25 subsidy was not going to affect Burra after it had done so well towards patriotic funds.

T. McWaters endorsed Mr Crewes’ remarks. A.D. McDonald, S.M. Lane and J.H. Gallagher also opposed the motion which was lost 5 to 12.

Profits, if any, this year would go to the Wounded Soldiers’ Fund.

The sheep dog trials ended £1-4-6 in credit, but they had yet to pay for advertising and trophy inscriptions.

Letter from ‘Municipal’. Recently the Council has shown concern about the quality control of milk in Burra. The quality is very good and it should be under the control of the Council, but they must first show they are capable of it, and judging by their action in meat inspection I would say don’t let them. At present anyone can come in from outside and sell from uninspected carts. Premises are not inspected. The Food and Drug Act allows for the inspection of carts. Four butchers in Burra pay licences and as many do not. Why not enforce Clause 103 of the Health Act of 1898 re the approval of slaughterhouses? Two other Corporations in SA enforce this and it ensures that meat is killed in an approved place. [Even if outside the Corporation area.]

French Flag Day is next Friday.

Badges will be sold in the street.

Afternoon tea will be provided by ladies of the Burra Red Cross, the Burra Cheer-up Society and Soldiers’ Aid Society.

Burra School was inspected last week and the very favourable report by Inspector McBride is printed.

George Thorpe received nasty burns to the face and right arm when he struck a match and an explosion occurred in a shed at the garage. Apparently rainwater had leaked into the carbide tin and generated some gas.

Weather. The end of last week was unpleasantly windy and dusty, but rain fell on Saturday. 1.80” was recorded at Burra and falls to the east ranged from 0.40” at Koomooloo to 0.85”at Quondong. The Mongolata area received 1.58” to 1.95”.

Obituary & Inquest.

Cornelius Horrigan died 16 September at the Burra Hospital from a broken spine sustained in a railway accident on 1 September.

[Death registered as Cornelius Hoorigan 15 September Kooringa, residence Brompton aged 47.]

E.W. Crewes was coroner at the inquest. Dr Steele gave evidence of the spinal injuries.

Michael Bolton, spiker, gave evidence that three section cars were travelling to the work site on 1 Sep. He was on the second which was carrying 12 men when it ran into the first at about 4 m.p.h. The third then ran into the second knocking their car into the first and forcing it off the tracks. The deceased was thrown from the first car and found lying on the ballast. He attributed the accident to wet rails and a stiff brake. He denied any racing or speeding. He thought 12 men too many for the car. The stiffness of the brake had not been reported.

John Ross, labourer gave similar evidence.

Daniel Ryan had been working the rear handle of the first car and the deceased the front handle. Ryan was also thrown off and somewhat hurt. He saw Horrigan dragged along under the car.

Francis Butler was on the second car and gave supporting evidence.

E.S.J. Clark, foreman, said he had reduced the numbers riding on cars from 14-16 to 12. There was no rule. [Ten cars had left Hallett that morning.]

Verdict was accidental death.

Burra Rifle Club. On Saturday A Sugars 97 from N.W.R. Pearce 96.

Burra Cheer-up Society is preparing for a big Anzac Day on 13 October 1915. [This day seems also to be referred to as Cheer-up Day.]

Pte Wahlert has sent a picture of himself to be hung in our room – the first such to arrive.

Pte L. [Lyall] Fuss was home too briefly for a social, but was given a gift.

French Flag Day raised £300 for French Red Cross. Lunches and afternoon tea was provided in Market Square and at the saleyards. The Band under A.G. Shortridge played in the rotunda. Badges and ribbons were sold. Mr Crewes gave one of his patriotic speeches. A French flag and a French banner were auctioned.

Mr Winnall supported the Mayor.

Mr J.M. McBride’s donations eventually totalled £56-5-0 so he ended with the banner which realised in all £125-5-0. The flag raised £84-8-0 and Mr J.H. Gallagher paid the highest aggregate. The total raised for the day was £308-4-10.

Pte Herb. Riggs writes from hospital in Malta on 31 July. He describes his wounds in which he lost a finger and has wounds to his palm, back and over the left kidney. He says he is progressing as well as he can and better than he expected. He is full of praise for the treatment he has received. Food is good and plentiful. He described the occasion of his wounding in some detail.

The British League is a society of young men who have hired a room in Queen St. On Wednesday they farewelled Robert Jones who has been at Walker & Sons for 13 months. He has been a member and librarian of the Burra Band.

Mr J.M. McBride was invited to Adelaide to ‘set’ a post in the construction of the Cheer-up Hut in recognition of his generosity to the cause. After French Flag Day he subsequently handed on a further cheque for £200 to be credited to Burra’s effort. After the ceremony in Adelaide he presented another £100 which we understand is to be credited to Burra Cheer-up Day.

Birth. A son to Mr & Mrs J.D. Kelly of Hallett on 6 September. [Ronald Cullen]

Mr J. Statton, from the High School has been accepted as a volunteer.

Fire. The Burra fire maniac has struck again and on Saturday c. 10.30 p.m. he tried to burn down W.J.C. Ewins drapery in Commercial St. Luke Day raised the alarm and the crowd from the picture show was soon there. The rear verandah and lean-to were ablaze and the shop roof was burning so the worst was feared. The thick smoke and the high fenced small yard made access difficult. Had the fire got a firm hold on the shop probably the whole block would have gone from Miss Snell’s corner. There is still no fire fighting equipment in Burra. After much effort the fire was extinguished. Two or three of the workers were much affected by smoke and the hard-working M-C Queale was rendered unconscious and had to be treated by Dr Steele. Though recovering, he still feels the effects. He was overcome trying to get to the books. That it was the work of an incendiary is undoubted.

Volunteers. Though Hampton had only 10 young men of military age, eight have been accepted and one rejected for military service. Five of them belong to the Brown family.

On Monday in an empty house there belonging to Mr Brown the people gathered to farewell Cliff Turner, Leslie McGowan, Thomas Brown, William Brown, and Albert Dunning. Lloyd Pearce from Aberdeen, who has also volunteered, was also present. Three of the Browns are in camp. J. Stewart was rejected. The odd one out is young McGowan, who is presently working on Lilydale Station.

Burra WCTU has sent a deputation to the Burra Show Society objecting to the provision of liquor at the show and seeking the prohibition of alcohol at the showgrounds. The petition contained 328 signatures.

The King had banned alcohol from the Royal Household for the duration.

The President could not say he was pleased to be waited on and it was a matter for the committee to decide.

The society was hard put to make ends meet with the war, the recent drought, loss of the £20 Government subsidy and this request would cost a further £20. The calling of a meeting required 14 days notice. He suggested the temperance people buy the liquor booth themselves – they had wealthy members – Mr Thomas for example could put up say £50. Rev. J.C. Jennison thought this a bit hard when last time it went for £10-£15.

The President [I.J. Warnes] said Mr Thomas could bid £25, but ‘we know he’s a liberal man and out for the cause’.

Also they could all join the Show Society and change things that way, but there was nothing he could do for this year.

Sgt R.G. Baynes writes from Gallipoli on 8 June. He writes 1 column on the Anzac landing on 25 April.

Bible Christian Centenary by the Rev. W.F. James.

The denomination began in a farmhouse in North Devon in October 1815 and circuits, districts and conferences were organised as it spread. It started in Canada in 1831. In SA James Blatchford took five days to come to Burra from Adelaide by bullock dray. He began services at Burra as a local preacher with John Pellew and James Halse. A church to seat 200 was built and there were soon 40 members attending and a Sunday school. In 1850 James Way arrived from England with James Rowe. Way settled in Adelaide and James Rowe came to Burra. He lived in the creek till a house was built. The church was doubled in size. Later in James Way’s pastorate there were 320 converts and a church to seat 600 was built. During my first term in Burra a new manse was built and over £500 raised towards it. Centenary celebrations will be held throughout Adelaide on 9 & 11 October.

Patron W.G. Hawkes

President R.J. McBride

Secretary L. Neagle

Captain W.H. Stevenson

Vice Captain J.T. F. Johnson

R.J.M. McBride: from an article in the Register on Saturday.

He is one of the grand old men of the pastoral industry. He is characterised by enterprise, energy, sound commonsense and a shrewd judgement rarely at fault. Though of recent years he has shed responsibility for sheep and wool interests he has continued to do good work principally of a philanthropic nature. The public would be surprised to discover how much money he has distributed in the last decade to benefit others. In connection with the different war funds alone he has subscribed £7,086 since November 1914. He was born in Nowry in the North of Ireland in 1831 and went to sea at an early age. He twice doubled the Horn. He tried his luck at the Victorian Goldfields and arrived in Adelaide in 1856 with 5/- in his pocket. He walked to Burra and was there engaged in carrying between Burra and Adelaide. He later took fencing and other contracts on sheep stations. In 1859 he became a squatter and over the years has owned many sheep stations. He established ‘The Gums’ out from Mt Mary and occupied it for 20 years. He was always interested in mining and early on recognised the potential of the Barrier field. He bought 100 £10 shares in the Propriety Co. and subsequently sold some of them for £1,400 each.

Miss Oehme has been transferred from the Burra School and Mr Thomas has replaced Mr Statton who is in camp.

Wilfred Geake, son of W. Geake of Kooringa, has been transferred from Bordertown where he was assistant telegraph operator to be senior operator at Quorn.

Notice. All arms and equipment of the Commonwealth must be returned by Friday under the War Precautions Act and failure to do so risks imprisonment and/or a heavy fine. [This was directed especially at members of the Light Horse etc.]

Pte Arthur Ockenden was on leave last week before departing on Monday on the same ship as Dr Steele.

Dr Steele was farewelled Thursday afternoon at the Institute. E.W. Crewes took the chair. Over 200 had now gone from the district including four nurses and two chaplains. Dr Steele was presented with an inscribed wristwatch of which the dial and hands were treated with radium so the time could be ascertained in the dark. There was also a parcel from the Burra Cheer-up Society. J.E.H. Winnall added to the Mayor’s remarks and so did Rev. S.J. Bloyd. He reminded the Mayor that Burra had already sent Dr Caw to join HMAS Australia and he had already served a terrible winter in the North Sea. J. McLaren, T.W. Wilkinson and Mr Harcus added their endorsements and Dr Steele made a suitable reply.

Burra Town Council.

On Monday night the Mayor reported that Mr Sedgman of the Waterworks had written to the Hydraulic Engineer with reference to the recent fire drawing attention to the fact that the people had drawn water without first giving notice. He told M-C Queale that he had exceeded his duty in using the hydrant and when he noticed the fire he should have returned to his office and written and posted an application to use the water. The Department had now claimed the hydrant and taken possession of it.

Cr Killicoat suggested they inquire what notice they would require for use of water in the event of a fire.

Cr McBride suggested formal permission be asked for use of water in the event of a fire.

Cr Radford moved that and also to allow the Council to hold the hydrant. Carried.

Volunteers.

Captain Lewis, Pte E.C. Collins of Hallett, Cpl J.E. Hatherly of Mt Bryan and Pte Stewart Cameron were all ill in hospital.

Sgt F. Treloar, nephew of F. Treloar of Kooringa, has been promoted to Lieutenant.

Cheer-up Day in Burra.

The task for the day was to look after those who have answered the call. It was to raise funds for the Cheer-up Hut in Adelaide and to inaugurate a fund to give assistance required by any local soldiers who may return incapacitated. The Governor and Lady Galway arrived at the station in the state car on Tuesday night. At 10 a.m. Wednesday they were given a civic reception by the Mayor and Councillors with a guard of cadets. There followed a procession to Kooringa.

Lieutenant Killicoat and the police were followed by the mounted Cheer-up Girls, the Vice-Regal Party, the Light Horse, Cadets, Citizen Forces, School Children, Burra Band, Boy Scouts, Despatch Riders, Rifle club, Representative Groups and Tableaux, Unattached Riders, Motor Cars and other Vehicles.

The most striking feature was the 42 mounted Cheer-up Girls, uniformly dressed in blue skirts, white blouses, white hats with red bands and coloured handkerchiefs loosely tied around their necks. The despatch riders were also a great acquisition. The two motor tableaux – one representing the Allies and the other Russia – were also striking. ‘Russia’ was a scene in greenery and snowflakes and Mr Schneider, manager for Vivian Lewis Ltd drove dressed in a bearskin.

An arch over the station gates carried the sign ‘Welcome’ in blue on white. Aberdeen was brilliant with flags and another arch reading ‘Welcome’ in white roses and greenery. In front of the Institute was another arch reading ‘Welcome’ in blue surrounded by greenery. Flags and bunting were everywhere. The procession ended and deposited their Excellencies on a platform in the square surrounded by the Cheer-up Girls, Light Horse and Cadets. The band played the National anthem and Mr Crewes welcomed the visitors with a patriotic speech which outlined the town and district’s contribution to the war effort: 200 men, 2 chaplains, 4 nurses, 2 doctors.

The Town Clerk, Mr E.J. Davey then read the beautifully Morocco-bound illuminated address to the Governor and Lady Galway. His Excellency responded.

Mrs J.H. Nield presented Lady Galway with a tinted photograph of the bunch of violets that sold for £381 on Violet Day. Lady Galway responded.

W.G. Hawkes then spoke followed by W.J. Sowden as President of the Cheer-up Society, Adelaide.

The Governor’s party then visited the old mine and inspected the Boy Scouts before lunch.

Lunch was taken in a tent erected for the occasion. And was organised by Mrs McLaren.

After lunch the Governor delivered a stirring address.

In the evening there was a concert at the Institute with more patriotic speeches between the items. Mr Sowden hoped the fine cavalcade of Cheer-up Girls would be in Adelaide for the opening of the Cheer-up Hut on 6 November. He believed Burra’s contribution to the war effort which amounted to c. £8 a head of population was the finest in Australia. Details of the sum raised are then given and the total turned out to be over £800.

Obituary. On 28 September Robert James Woollacott was killed in action in France. He was the 5th son of T.H. Woollacott and was aged 28. [Born 10 March 1886 Aberdeen: died at Vermelles, France.]

R.J. Woollacott was born at Aberdeen. He learned shorthand and typing in Melbourne and worked with Mr Radford. He left there and went to work at the Magnetic Works under Mr Maryatt. When the works closed he went to Adelaide for a time before getting a position in electrical machinery at the Central Mine in Broken Hill. Here he studied and passed exams in 1905-07. He continued studying electrical engineering in 1909-11 while working in an electric tramway powerhouse. He passed each year with honours and became an inspector over his own and other powerhouses. In May 1913 he went to work for Sims Bros of Stafford in England – electrical machinery manufacturers. He intended to return to a position in the Melbourne electrical railway system. When war broke out he enlisted on 3 September 1914 and was in the trenches from about Christmas time until 28 September when he was killed. He distinguished himself in the army, rapidly rising from the ranks and being mentioned in despatches by Sir John French for valour.

Obituary. QMS P.D. Killicoat, known as Darby, was wounded at Gallipoli on 18 September and died on 19 September. He was the son of the late P.L. Killicoat. He was educated at Roseworthy College and was a noted athlete and footballer. He was a member of the Light Horse and among the 1st to respond to the call-up. He was aged 24, the 3rd son in the family. His brother, Dave, is also at the front and his sister, Madge, has volunteered as a nurse. [Phillip Darby Killicoat born 12 June 1890 Redruth: died 19 September 1915 on board the Maheno, off Gallipoli.]

Burra Cheer-up Society

Last issue we briefly mentioned welcomes for Chaplain Captain Nield and Trooper Ockenden and Pte Parks and farewells to Sgt Lewey and Pte Oates of WA who were on a visit and to Ptes Horace Oates of Leighton, Stanley Pearce of Kooringa and Ashton of Farrell’s Flat – the latter group on their long leave before embarkation. Rev. Nield responded. He said how glad Burra boys were to get a copy of the Record and how proud they all were of the effort to support the war. In Burra one in thirteen had volunteered. In England it was one in fifteen and for Australia generally one in thirty-five. They were aware and appreciative of the fine work of Mr Crewes and the Cheer-up Society. He reported very favourably on the treatment of the wounded. He talked too of soldiers suffering shock from wounds, but also from seeing mates blown away from beside them. Red Cross gifts from Australia did arrive, despite delays at times. On their return they had been feted in Fremantle, Melbourne, Ballarat, Stawell, Horsham and Murray Bridge with gifts of oranges, chocolates etc.

Pte Oates of WA thanked them for their kindness. He had been born in Burra and left 20 years before. During the evening Pte Parks had to retire as he is quite unwell.

Public Welcome for Volunteers.

On Tuesday at the Institute there was a public welcome for Captain Chaplain Nield, Trooper Ockenden, Pte Ashton and Signaller [Ross] Harris. Mr Crewes welcomed the returned men followed by Rev. J.C. Jennison who urged the Government to adopt conscription. He tells a story of the discovery of a whole series of buildings at a Lutheran Mission near the top of the Australian Bight near a beautiful bay for landing and within easy reach of the overland railway – all of which he found very disturbing. The social evil of drink should also be put down and prohibition introduced for all. Rev. S.J. Bloyd spoke and then Mr Winnall. Captain Nield responded on behalf of all the returned men. He included some interesting observations on the broadening effect the adventure was having on Australians and how their admiration of the Indians they had encountered would mean ‘The boys would come back feeling that the White Australia policy must go by the board’.

Ross Hayes, who was wounded twice and contracted typhoid, writes from Epsom Hospital in England on 24 August. His brother has also gone to the front and his father is about to leave. He writes of terrible episodes in Gallipoli – of one attack where the roll call found only 232 of the 850 who had advanced. After he was wounded he was sent to England and describes the journey on the Aquitania. He reports very favourably on his medical treatment and conditions.

Leighton Hall annual dinner was held last Thursday. It was a wet night, but attendance was still very good. The hall president, I.J. Warnes, presided. The Mayor of Burra, Mr Crewes, Captain Chaplain Nield and Signaller Harris were especially welcomed. The speeches of course were dominated by the war and Captain Nield gave an address. He spoke of the positive outcome of the war and the possibility it gave for the rebirth of the nations of Europe from the melting pot of war. Mr Crewes thanked him for his vote of confidence and the hope which was sadly wanted. He regretted that the war had seen the delay in the building of a Hanson-Booborowie railway. Details of speeches etc. extend for c. 21⁄2 columns.

Kooringa Methodist Church Anniversary last Sunday. Rev. Henry Howard officiated to large congregations. Miss B.E. Pearce, for so long organist at the church, was presented with a purse of sovereigns.

Mr W. Wilson, an old and honoured veteran of the Crimean War was presented to the Governor on Cheer-up Day.

W.B. Page has applied and been appointed acting general secretary to the Liberal Union in Adelaide, so we lose one of our most able townsmen.

Burra Cheer-up Society presented Lieut. N.H. McBride with an inscribed bugle on Tuesday 12 October. Due to the short notice of his leaving an impromptu farewell was organised for him at 2 p.m.

During the week five of the Cheer-up girls assisted at the farewell dinner to 2,300 soldiers in Adelaide.

Farewell gifts were given to Ptes Foster, Lee and R. Wilson who were not here long enough for a social evening.

£50 worth of packed billycans has been sent off as Christmas gifts to troops. E.J. Harris has sent a large crate of eggs to the Keswick Hospital.

Visiting Day & Speech Day at Burra School was held last Friday. The headmaster Mr J.T.F. Johnson gave an address of welcome. Mr Thomas reported on the High School where the numbers were 33 (17 boys and 16 girls) at the start of the year, but were now only 21 (9 boys and 12 girls). In 1914 the numbers had been 26 in January and 24 in December. In 1913 there had been 28 in January and December. This year boys had left to fill the gaps created when others volunteered for the war effort.

Captain Chaplain Nield and Signaller Ross Harris were welcomed. Mr J. McLaren as chairman of the School Board of Advice said it was probably for the last time he would serve as such as the new Education Bill proposed to abolish the Boards and substitute a committee for each school. The present system did make it hard to keep in touch with the condition and needs of each school in the district. Mr Winnall spoke as a Board member and Mr Crewes as Mayor. Captain Chaplain Nield spoke of Egypt and a visit there to the El-Ahzar University which had 11,000 students, all male, and whose 500 teachers were each paid just 6d a month.

West Burra Copper Mine

Last week 90’ west from the 50’ level a piece of bornite was found. This was a high % ore. At the 100’ level good ore is showing at 87’ west of the shaft.

Salvation Army. The Self-Denial Fund has raised £165. Miss Laura C. Pearce collected £81 of this sum.

Fire. Last week a spark from discarded ashes apparently set fire to curtains at the residence of Mr C. Lott in Paxton Terrace. Fortunately the fire was extinguished with about £10-£12 damage done.

The Eastern Plains. A lunatic has been frightening womenfolk to the east for some weeks. He has been wandering about with a gun and now and again approaches homesteads and demands food. Last Wednesday he visited Redcliffe. Mrs McBride tried to phone in, but could not make contact till evening. M-C Queale went out Thursday and found the man in the pigsty where he had spent the night. He seemed quite harmless, saying he found the bed quite comfortable and not too smelly, but the fleas were awful. He said his name was Smithers and after examination he was sent to the mental home.

Burra Show. This turned out to be a brilliant success. Despite the reduced prize money exhibits were good and attendance was also good in excellent weather. The main difference seems to be the later date. It is impossible to find a date that suits both farmers and pastoralists equally well. Perhaps we could hold a sheep show in conjunction with the dog trials. ‘The sideshows were numerous if not uplifting.’ The agricultural produce was not plentiful, but was of high quality. Butter was particularly good and cattle and horses were of good quality. Gate takings were £96-10-6 which was said to be a record. Attendance was very large.

Burra Town Council

Letter from the Hydraulic Engineer re the use of mains water for fires, to the effect that the matter was under consideration.

Cr Radford moved that water be laid on to the reserve in Ludgvan St and it be planted with grass. Carried.

The fire hose has arrived. Resolved that a fire reel be purchased and it be stored at the depot.

Mr Sedgman has been ordered to return the hydrant to Adelaide and had done so.

The Department is to be written to asking for its return.

The Mayor to convene a meeting at a suitable time to discuss the formation of a fire brigade.

Cr Radford moved the relaying of the ford near Gully’s as required. Lowering its height was debated. It was resolved that no action be taken till the road was put on the Main Roads Grant.

The Mayor was asked to stand again. He said he had approached Mr Winnall to stand, but as that gentleman had declined he would stand unless some other candidate came forth.

Sympathy was extended to Cr Killicoat and Mrs P.L. Killicoat on the death of Sgt D. Killicoat in action.

Soldiers’ Aid Society. Approximately 500 sandbags have been despatched. The fund stands at £116-17-6.

Burra Cheer-up Society. On 1 November Captain Chaplain Nield gave an interesting lecture on Egypt. L.M. Gordon, who was leaving for the front, wrote to thank the Society for its gift.

Pte F. Tiver writes that he is ill in hospital in Egypt.

A social was given to L-Cpl Bennetts, Pte Edmunstan and Pte Higgins on 2 November.

Cheer-up girls from Burra will provide the mounted escort for the Governor when he opens the Cheer-up Hut in Adelaide at 3.30 p.m. tomorrow.

Pte John Lockett was given a farewell social at Leighton on Saturday. Pte E.S. Williams and Pte J. Williams were also present.

Pte Hartley Harris writes from the convalescent home that he is now in good health, bur an old knee injury had flared up and he may either be confined to light duties in Egypt or sent home. He describes his accommodation in the convalescent home and the daily routine. He has seen Lieut. Copley and Stewart Cameron and Nurse Walker at No. 3 Auxiliary Hospital before he was sent to convalesce. Nurse Walker said Sister Wood was in Gallipoli.

Pte Will Pederson writes from Gallipoli on 6 September. He reports that Kenyon and Frank Treloar have both been promoted to Lieutenant. He also saw Jim Hatherly, Percy Herbert, Reg. Sandland, Sport Lord and the Killicoats. Lance Lewis and Fred Harvey are away sick and Graham Dow is in England, wounded. On the 20 September he writes that he saw Lel Kellaway who has been made a corporal. Herb. Riggs has gone to England wounded. He tells of German aircraft bombing the trenches in Gallipoli.

Letter from ‘Bandsman’ re Patriotism

The Burra Show society enquired about the Band’s terms for playing at the show, given it was a patriotic function. The Band decided to play for £5-5-0, to defray expenses – little more than half the usual fee. The Show Society refused and accused the Band of being unpatriotic. The Show Society itself will pay all over expenses to the patriotic fund – not all, but all over expenses. Did they ask anyone else working that day to do so without pay? I guess not! Did they ask the sideshow men to contribute their takings?

‘Again where was our show committee’s patriotism when [deciding on] prizes for the best German cake.’

He then outlines their patriotic activities:

Sacred concert for Cheer-up funds

Sacred concert for Soldiers’ Aid funds

Have come out for all functions held for patriotic funds

Have worked sideshows etc. as well as playing on Cheer-up day

Pte H.L. Riggs writes from the hospital ship Oxfordshire en route to England 31 August. He is just about convalescent now ‘and got about a little sightseeing in Malta. He writes of his transfer from Southampton to London and the sights along the way to the hospital at New End, Hampstead.

Charge Nurse Faulkner, here for some months, left Burra on Monday en route for service in Egypt. Nurse Meldridge, a trainee of Adelaide Hospital succeeds her in Burra.

Burra Cheer-up Society had a good time in the city last Thursday at the opening of the Cheer-up Hut and the mounted girls were much admired. The Mayor, E.W. Crewes was almost rendered speechless by the tremendous ovation he received when called upon to make an address in recognition of the magnificent work done for our boys in this town and district.

Captain Chaplain Nield gave a lecture on Egypt at the Institute on Monday evening to a crowded hall. Proceeds went to the Cheer-up Funds. Visiting soldiers L-Cpl Bennetts and Ptes Edmondson and Higgins were also on the platform. [Report extends c. 1 column.]

Burra Cheer-up Society.

On 2 Nov. there was a welcome for visiting wounded soldiers L-Cpl Bennetts and Ptes Edmondson & Higgins. Pte Alf Isaac was farewelled.

4 Nov. about 40 members went to Adelaide by the morning train to participate in opening of the Cheer-up Hut in Adelaide. At noon they were given lunch by the Adelaide Cheer-up Society and after lunch they paraded the main streets mounted on their horses before forming a guard of honour for the Governor and Lady Galway. In the evening they were again at the Hut, where a number of soldiers were entertained.

6 Nov. there was a farewell social for Ptes W. Herbert & R. Winders and for Troopers Lloyd Pearce, Eric Vivian, will Brown, Tom Brown, L. McGowan and Albert Dunning.

(Half of them from Hampton.) Three other soldiers were given parcels: Sgt Wadmore & Ptes Trevilyan and Przibilla. The first two sent their regrets at not being able to attend.

Redruth Methodist Sunday School anniversary was held last Sunday. Rev. Thomas P. Willason of Saddleworth officiated. The tea meeting on Monday was largely attended. F. Sara (Sec.) said 84 girls and 64 boys were on the roll and average attendance was 114. There were 25 teachers. Two old scholars had so far been killed in the war: R.J. Woollacott and Pte Camp. The Treasurer, Mr H. Fuss, reported receipts of £48-17-11⁄2 and expenditure of £45-4-71⁄2. Anniversary takings were £12-10-1, so the new year starts with a credit of £16-2-6. Primary and Kindergarten reports are printed.

Thanks were extended to ‘the boys’ L. Clode, A. Tiver and H. Fuss, who, by their own unaided exertions had erected a pulpit in the church which had proved so eminently convenient.

Sgt R.J. Woollacott’s letters continue to arrive. One on 26 August tells of his movement towards the front and on 5 September, two days after the anniversary of his enlistment, he reflected on the year past and speculated on the good that might come out of this catastrophe – of the lessons the war might teach.

Sgt R.J. Baynes writes from Gallipoli dated 12 Sep. He is on a hill called Sari Bair and he describes the landscape: ‘I cannot describe to you what a bayonet charge is like. It is a very awful affair and is like getting drunk – it is alright while the fun is at its height. You have no time to think, but after it is all over is when you feel it.’

‘Nearly all the chaps who landed here are either gone away wounded or sick, I have only four left out of fifty-nine I landed with.’

F. Harris, Treasurer of Burra cheer-up Society, writes explaining what has happened to all the socks made for the boys at the front – to dispel all doubts that they are getting to those for whom they were intended.

Redruth Police Court.

Gustav Kuchenmeister sued James Edward Donaghy for the balance of:

£28-4-3 for labour and work done, £30 for the loss of two horses, £95 for the depreciation in value of 19 horses at £5 a head and £60 for loss of contract profit.

The ground were alleged fraudulent misrepresentation, or breach of warranty.

There was a counter-claim for £70 for breach of contract. The details are extensive and extend for over 23⁄4 columns. The bench eventually gave judgement for the plaintiff for £13-7-2 and for the counter-claim of £70 with no costs on the £13-7-2, but costs on the counter-claim of £70 and plaintiff was non-suited on most aspects of his claim.

Notice. John Herman Schneider, garage manager of Burra, has changed his name to John Glenister and his wife will henceforth be known as Doris Glenister instead of Doris Schneider.

Reg, Sandland & Cecil Lord are sick in hospital in Malta.

Volunteers.

Reg. Murray & Fred Highett were examined, but not accepted.

A. Bartholomæus, A. Tiver & T. Carpenter were passed.

Burra Boy Scouts now number 38, under Mr Rigney. Last weekend they enjoyed a camp at the showgrounds despite the rough weather.

Re John Glenister, formerly John Schneider, we point out that the Schneiders have been residents of London for over 100 years and have no connection in any way with any enemy country.

Incendiarism. Last Friday at c. 10.30 a box of shavings was set alight and drawn up against the back door of F. Harris’s shop. The flames got a good hold on the door and shed and in a few minutes more would have been hard to quell, but they were fortunately quickly extinguished. An inquest will be held today.

Fire Brigade. A meeting on Monday to discuss forming a fire brigade drew surprisingly few in view of the events of recent months. Volunteers were called for and Messrs Truscott, J. Allen, G. Burns, S.M. Lane, A.J. Collins, Wilson, J.W. Bowen, A.J. Gebhardt, M.A. Radford, F. Moore and L. Lihou handed in their names. Mr Truscott was elected captain and E.J. Davey the Hon. Sec. It was decided to ask the Burra Coppermining Co. for the mine fire-bell and the leather buckets lying around the mine. We note that in 1885 the Record strongly recommended the formation of a fire brigade.

Burra Town Council

The Hydraulic Engineer’s Office has offered to supply a hydrant etc. for £5. If a fire brigade were formed 24 hours notice of a wet practice would have to be given to the fitter in charge who must attend the same and be paid by Council. When a fire occurred the mains could be tapped without notice. When the last fire occurred the covering on one fireplug was damaged. The Mayor said the most ridiculous part of the whole affair was the taking of the hydrant to Adelaide. Had the fire last Friday got a hold half the town might have burnt down although the Council had procured everything else to fight the fire. ‘Had it not been too late he would have telegraphed to the Department asking them to return the hydrant with permission to use the water. The terms of the letter will be complied with and a hydrant procured. The approximate cost of a fire reel is £7-10-0 and S. Burns offer to make on was accepted.

C. Wilkinson moved Lane Gardens be planted with grass.

Belgian Relief Fund now at £1,157-17-3.

Copperhouse School visiting day was last Friday. The inspectors report presents the school in a most favourable light. The monitor, Miss Brenda Edwards, got 95% for her junior and first classes. The head teacher, Mr Mazzarol introduced the Mayor who was invited to unveil a photograph of the late Pte John Camp, who was a former scholar at Copperhouse. Among other things there was an exhibition of flag signalling by the boys. The report extends for 1 column.

Burra Racing Club AGM last Friday at the Liberal Union rooms. The club was in debt £128-9-6 and had a signed guarantee for £125. The President, Mr A.G. Gebhardt said the debt was due to a bad year last year combined with costly improvements. This year £20 would get the track in order and with reduced stakes a good part of the debt might be wiped out and the rest in 1916. The secretary has applied for the 3rd Saturday in January for a meeting. It was agreed to go ahead with the meeting. The Hon. J. Lewis was re-elected Patron and A.G. Gebhardt was re-elected President. Mr Treloar tendered his resignation as Secretary as he was not greatly interested in the sport and they needed someone with a keener interest and furthermore he was likely to be absent from the town in January. The position will be advertised at £20 p.a. The stakes were fixed at £225.

Burra Cheer-up Society held three farewell gatherings for the week ending 12 Nov. Two have been reported and on 12 Nov. the farewell was for Pte S. Lihou, while Driver Williams, a returned soldier, was welcomed to Burra. Sympathy was extended to Pte Page who broke his arm while here on leave last Tuesday.

Thanks to A.J. McBride for a generous contribution towards the expenses of the horses at the opening of the Cheer-up Hut. Also to G.E. Dane who took general responsibility and to Lieut. J.C. Killicoat for drilling the girls and to the young men who trucked and cared for the horses and to those men who lent their horse for the occasion.

Court of Appeal

The Railway Commissioner said railway residences were not subject to rates under the Act and cited Mr Justice Murray in 14 Nov. 1914. The mayor said that notwithstanding that the Dec. 1914 Municipal Corporations Amendments Act provided residences used by the Government were subject to rating. A test case being conducted by the Mitcham Council might decide the issue and the matter was adjourned pending that decision.

The hotels asked for a reduction in rates due to the early closing. This was refused, but will be reconsidered after the Early Closing Act comes into force.

W.I. Short had an assessment reduced from £7 to £3-15-0 on blocks and an uninhabited house rendered unfit for habitation by the recent flood.

Accident. When returning from Koonoona on Saturday the king bolt in the trap came out and the occupants were thrown out. In the process Mr Lewis’s knee knocked out two of Mrs Lewis’s teeth and she fainted. A car was sent from Koonoona and returned the party to Koonoona and later home.

E.J. Harris has put in a plant making butter fresh daily at his Kingston St Premises. A room and cellar have been set up and dairy owners will be able to dispose of cream locally instead of sending it away by rail.

Burra Creek. There is still disagreement about the use of the Burra Creek. Mr Lewis held the right to buy the creek including the plantations made by Council, but he would allow the Council to buy the Creek at the same price provided his firm was assured a right of way for their stock to their yards. As part of this they need the right to impound to prevent town cattle from grazing there and so preserving a bite for the travelling stock. This would not prevent the Council’s own horses from grazing. The current dispute is over this right to impound. Cr Radford had understood Mr Lewis was leasing only the bed of the creek. Mr Winnall believed the Council was at least morally bound to grant the lease and since he also points out that the Council is a continuing body he seems to imply it also may have a legal obligation.

Soldiers’ Aid Society. Another 300 sandbags have been either made or taken home to be made up. The fund stands at £135-16-0.

Black Springs Red Cross held a garden fete and concert at Koonoona which raised some £50. Reported in 1 column.

Burra Hospital. Mr H. Walker has resigned as porter owing to advancing age and John Harvey has been appointed in his place.

Inquest. On Thursday E.W. Crewes JP conducted an inquest into the attempted incendiarism at F. Harris’s shop in Kooringa on 12 Nov.

Francis Harris:

In the afternoon unpacked three cases of confectionery and put the cases three to four yards from the back verandah outside. There was some packing paper in the cases. Locked the back doors at 9.45 and closed the shop about 10.00 or 10.10. Everything then seemed alright. Went home to Chapel St with my brother. Was not home ten minutes when the Methodist Church bell rang. Went outside and could see the glare of the fire. Ran down the street to opposite the police station where I met George Lawn who said it was my place, but the fire was under control. Got to the shop and one of the three boxes was still burning and the matchboard enclosing the back verandah had been pulled away. Do not smoke and had no light in the yard. The stock was insured for £400. No idea of the origin of the fire. There are two entrances to the yard. On behind Miss Snell’s and the other through Ewins’ yard. Saw a strange man leaning against a tree on Dalgety’s corner.

E.J. Harris corroborated his brother’s evidence.

Frank Blott had helped to unpack the confectionery about 3-4 p.m., but was not in the yard in the evening.

Clare Tiver, groom, was in front of the Burra Hotel about 10.20 when he saw the fire and ran across the square and through the Record office to see that the fire was at Frank Harris’s. Someone pulled the box away and F. Streicher kicked in the door and threw some water on the fire.

J. Allen said he had gone through the Record office and pulled the box away.

‘Did not apply to the Commissioner of Water Supply for permission to use the water.’

E.G. Burns saw someone walk from Dalgety’s corner up the lane opposite, but did not see him return. This was c. 10.10. Ran to the fire around Miss Snell’s corner.

Annie Snell gave evidence of hearing M-C Queale checking at the back. Soon after heard crackling, but couldn’t believe it was fire so soon after the police inspection. Soon after she put on a coat to check out the continued noise and by the time she got there the fire was almost out.

M-C Queale said he had not been there, but on Dunk’s corner watching some boys. Then she said it was someone in uniform. ‘Heard the crackling noise almost immediately after Mr Queale turned the corner.’

On the Saturday Queale admitted he had been around the back ‘for a private purpose’.

Eva Reynolds, who lived with Miss Snell, gave evidence consistent with Miss Snell’s.

M-C Queale:

Went to Truscott’s house at 9.45 p.m. to get my wife, but she was playing the piano so went across to the Burra Hotel and could hear some young fellows rapping the sign boards on the verandahs opposite with sticks. Walked to Miss Snell’s and up the side street and waited a few minutes for the boys to appear. They walked quietly past so I did not speak to them. Walked on to the lane entrance and c. 2 yards in for a private purpose. Then returned to the street, passed Mr Harris at his shop and went home. Did a little in the garden then turned the hose off and saw E.J & F. Harris going home. Went into the office: it was then 10.15. Went and collected my wife and heard the cry of Fire!

The jury concluded that the fire was caused by a person or persons unknown. That M-C Queale was in no way connected with it and his name should not have been brought into the case. When questioned by Mr Winnall, who was appearing for F. Harris, the foreman said they had not specifically mentioned Mr F. Harris as the evidence conclusively proved he was not connected in any way.

Annual Meeting of Ratepayers, Monday 29 Nov. at the Institute.

J.E.H. Winnall took the chair.

A motion approving of the way Mr Crewes had discharged his mayoral duties was passed by acclamation.

Cr Lane thanked all for returning him unopposed.

Cr Radford did the same. Cr Killicoat’s enforced absence on military duties, even to the neglect of his own business, had placed more work on his (Mr Radford’s) shoulders and he thanked the other councillors for their assistance. It was nice now to have Cr Killicoat back to share the load in North Ward.

Cr Dane, who had been elected unopposed was surprised as two candidates had withdrawn whom he thought would have filled the position much better, in W. Hodge and J. Drew and he thanked them both for their courtesy.

The Mayor felt he had neither sins of commission or omission to confess. The parklands account practically being the only one in arrears. When he took office two years before £150 was owing on the creek and £40 for a block of land purchased by the Council. Of that £150 had been wiped off. He felt the town was spending too much on lighting. He intended to make further enquiries about electric lighting, but it would cost £5,000 to £6,000 which would be hard to raise at a reasonable rate of interest. With reference to the bridges washed away, the Government was paying for one to be erected opposite the Institute and the other two would be erected when the department had funds. The tar paving would be more effective with a £20 or £30 heater.

Cr Lane said he was in favour of tree planting, tar paving and electric lighting, provided a scheme reasonably sure to pay was submitted.

Cr Radford thought one of the three permanent billets on council should have gone to Aberdeen [i.e. one of the three employees] He thought they needed a heater to make tar paving satisfactory and he favoured an electricity scheme as soon as the Burra Mine reopened.

Mr Crewes thought the only use of the creek was for a plantation and spending £150 to buy it had been a waste of money.

Cr Lane thought it one of the wisest things Council ever did.

Mr McLaren said that the Hon. John Lewis had offered the Council £100 if it would stand aside and not purchase the creek – Would Councillors accept £250 for it now?

The Mayor would. Cr Radford said it should never have been out of Council hands.

The mayor was in favour or re-erecting Deadman’s Bridge and borrowing money to do it.

Cr McWaters concurred.

Crs McBride and Lane thought it would have to remain as it was under the circumstances and Cr Killicoat thought the same until the bridge at Gully’s was re-erected.

The Mayor’s Report for 1915.

After last year’s disastrous drought this year’s season has been very good with prospects for an excellent harvest.

Unfortunately the war that started in August 1914 still rages. In supporting the war effort Burra has shouldered the burden with energy and a great cheerfulness.

Burra and district has sent 220 men, 2 chaplains, 5 nurses and 2 doctors to the front and subscribed £13-968-14-9:

Patriotic Fund Cash £301-0-0

Belgian Fund Cash £1,156-15-3

Belgian Fund Clothing £100-0-0

Commercial Travellers’ Day £279-0-0

Red Cross Cash £324-0-6

Red Cross Clothing £122-0-0

Cheer-up Society Violet Day £414-0-0

Cheer-up Society Cash £103-0-0

Cheer-up Society Blanket Fund £250-0-0

Soldiers’ Aid Society Cash £109-19-0

Soldiers’ Aid Society Clothing £210-0-0

Australia Day Cash £2,100-0-0

French Flag Day £608-0-0

Soldiers’ Memorial Fund £50-0-0

Cheer-up Day in Aid of Soldiers’ Hut

And Wounded Soldiers’ Fund £805-0-0

Cash direct to City Funds £7,036-0-0

The Cheer-up Society is doing wonderful work for those who have left for the front and for those returning sick and wounded.

The Soldiers’ Aid Society is working hard doing similar kinds of work to the Red Cross.

Violet Day was a red letter day in Burra with the auction of a bunch of violets raising £384 and a total of £414 for the day.

Australia Day was the town’s best effort with £2,100 raised.

French Flag Day raised £608 for the French Red Cross.

On 13 October the town welcomed Sir Henry and Lady Galway. Welcome arches were erected at the station gate, in Aberdeen and in Kooringa and the whole town was gaily decorated with flags and bunting. Of the £805 collected £250 was sent to Adelaide toward the Cheer-up Hut while £550 was kept for the purpose of assisting wounded soldiers who may return to us later on. The funds are still open to receive donations.

During the year the drought broke and heavy rains did much good, but consequent floods badly damaged roads, footpaths etc. and swept away three of our bridges: the one near Lord’s Hotel, one at the south end of town [presumably at the Pig and Whistle crossing] and one at the old White Hart Hotel at the north end of town. We have received £350 special grant to repair roads and arrangements have been made to replace the bridges. Plans and specifications have been received from the Government Engineer and tenders called for the first one to be built across the creek opposite the Burra Institute.

The town has been brought under the Building Act which will prevent the erection of unsightly buildings in the town. It has also been placed under the Places of Public Entertainment Act which provides for means of safety in places of entertainment in the event of fire or panic.

For many years Burra has been totally unprovided for in the event of fire. In the last 12 months there have been several outbreaks. In most cases we were fortunate to control the fires before much damage was done, but in one case considerable loss of property resulted. The Council has now purchased hydrants, a hose and a hand reel and have organised a volunteer fire brigade.

The Burra Band continues to make progress and has rendered great service to the various patriotic committees by responding to their appeals for help. Mr James Bentley has resigned from the leadership and Mr A.G. Shortridge has taken his place.

Rates collected: General £437-15-4

Parklands £73-2-10

Health £255-5-6

Lighting £109-6-11

Total outstanding rates £12-19-4

The general account began the year £24-18-9 in debit and is now £68-0-3 in credit.

North Ward began £24-15-2 in debt and is now £11-2-7 in debt.

East Ward began £0-8-7 in debt and is now £23-13-4 in credit.

West Ward began £4-0-10 in credit and is now £38-4-2 in credit.

Parklands. In the year all dead trees were removed and hundreds of young trees, mainly pines, were planted, but unfortunately not with great success. A new garden is being planted in Ludgvan St. There is a plan to plant the eastern side of the Creek.

Cemetery. Mr H. Wilson has been appointed curator and when not employed there he attends to the various garden plots and other general work. This arrangement has been a success.

The main roads continue to be maintained and two sections have been added: Sara’s Corner to the junction with the Mt Bryan Road and the length from the Bon Accord Corner to the western boundary of the Corporation. The grant this year was £430. The special grant is still in credit £135-0-8.

Tar paving was proceeded with during the year and extension of it is intended. Though expensive to begin with it is the cheapest way to manage main roads in the long run.

During the year our Health Officer, Dr J.I. Sangster, died. Dr Steele took over until his departure on active service and now Dr Williams carries out the duty. The present balance of £34-15-4 is needed in case of any outbreak of infectious disease.

Mr George Lawn has been permanent scavenger – previous appointments by tender had generally proved unsatisfactory. The Council purchased its own horse and dray for the purpose.

Health Officer’s Report. There was an outbreak of enteric fever [typhoid] early in the year and then little infectious disease. There were three cases of chicken pox and one of tuberculosis. The typhoid outbreak was of 12 cases, mostly in March and April.

Electric light continued to be discussed by Council, but at this time it was thought inopportune and the Council decided to wait for an easier money market after the war. Of the rates of £109-8-5, carbide cost £41-19-1 and the lighting of lamps cost £50-14-0.

The new reservoir erected by the side of the old one has assured the town of adequate water supply in the future.

Burra Mine. An article reprinted from the Register of 23 October 1915.

The Burra Mine is to be sold on 27 January 1916 by public auction.

On 16 April 1845 the SA Mining Association came into being to develop the colony’s mineral wealth and prevent it all falling into the hands of one or two of the wealthy.

It issued shares to £5,000 in £5 shares with liberty to increase them to £20,000 worth. Its aims were:

To purchase or sell mineral lands

To carry on mining operations when they were advisable

To let on royalty or otherwise

In response to an advertisement placed by the Secretary, H. Ayers, a shepherd named Stear produced a valuable copper specimen he said he had discovered on unsold wasteland to the north of Mr F.H. Dutton’s Princess Royal sheep run. The part of the Burra Survey which comprises the Burra Burra Mines was not known to be metalliferous till a few weeks after Stear’s find when Thomas Picket, a bullock driver employed by William Robinson, then of Gum Creek, had his attention taken by an outcrop of red oxide of copper. A special survey of 20,000 acres was made embracing the two finds and on 20 Sep. 1845 it was divided into two parts. The northern moiety which turned out to be the really valuable one fell to SAMA.

Ten Cornish miners, a blacksmith and a Captain were sent north and arrived at Burra on 29 Sep. 1845. They blasted out the red oxide and sent it back on the drays that had carried their supplies north.

After purchasing the freehold of the 10,000 acres SAMA had just £1,800 of working capital, but in the first seven months they made £20,000 profit and the ensuing eleven months produced a nett profit of £70,000.

For the 291⁄2 years of the mine’s operation between 1845 and 30 Sep. 1877:

Ore produced 234,648 tons

Realised nett. £3,110,911

Cost of production £2,284,325

Profit £826,586

Wages £1,400,988

The peak employment half year was to 31 March 1859 with an average 1,087 and a peak of 1,170.

The peak output was for the half year to 31 March 1851, of 12,966 tons.

And the peak half year for the sum realised was to 30 Sep. 1850, £127,410.

To the end of May 1867 dividends had been £315 per £5 share.

Official records show that in the six months to March 1849, 9,310 tons of ore was carted to Pt Adelaide over 100 miles of unmade roads by c. 600 teamsters, using between 6,000 and 7,000 bullocks.

A strike in 1848 held up operations for 6 months. Before it ended arrangements were made for the Patent Copper Co. (Now the English & Australian Copper Co.) to smelt the ore and the first copper was produced there in the winter of 1849.

The establishment of the smelters made possible the handling of lower grade ore profitably.

The mine was at its peak of success at the end of 1851.

Gold discoveries in Victoria saw the suspension of all work below water level as men left for the goldfields.

Pumping ceased on 1 Oct. 1852 and it was not resumed till 4 January 1855. It then took 17 days to fork the water at the 40 fathom level.

Work was resumed after the Governor, Sir H.E.F. Young induced the Emigration Commissioners to relax some of their more stringent regulations and allow Cornish miners to migrate to SA. The low price of copper and the unprofitable working with high costs of open cutting led to closure in 1877.

For many years mining was limited to tributing, but in 1901 the present Burra Burra Copper Co. was formed to buy the mine and work it. It bought everything except the interest of SAMA in the township blocks.

Old Reports show that there were no extensive operations below the 300’ level. In 1901 it was considered there were tailings and other material on the surface estimated at between 170,000 and 440,000 tons that would yield between 0.86 and 2.72% copper which might give a profit of from 2/- to 3/- per ton and some of 4/- to 5/- per ton. They did not propose to carry on where the old mine left off, but to treat the tailing etc. and to prospect likely places where indications were favourable.

Every visitor to Burra notes with interest the open cut. About 1,000’ south is Morphett’s Shaft which was connected with Waterhouse’s and Peacock’s Shafts at the 300’ and 360’ levels by drives and crosscuts and with Waterhouse’s at 420’. Drives were also put in at 510’ and were in sulphide for considerable distances. Sulphide was also found at 600’ at the bottom of Morphett’s Shaft as reported in the final report to the directors of SAMA by Captain Sanders on 11 October 1877, shortly before it was shut down. He reported that Morphett’s Shaft had been completed to 100 fathoms, the last 10 feet on part of Kingston’s Lode of soft quartz, carbonate of lime and fluorspar, and patches of very rich purple yellow and flesh-coloured ore and scales of asbestos.

A bore pit several years ago confirmed this lode at 600’ and that it was continuous in strike and exists at 800’. At the time the Government Geologist, H.Y.L. Brown thought it justified putting Morphett’s Shaft in order and restarting mining operations from that point.

Magnetic treatment of the tailings was tried by representatives of Elder, Smith & Co. and F.H. Snow, but was unsuccessful. An option was let to the Great Fingall Consolidated, but the bursting of the 1907-08 copper boom put an end to their interest, they paid a substantial sum for release from their obligations. Since then little or no work has been done.

Characteristics of the 1915 Paper

Page 1 had large advertisements and sometimes a considerable amount of news, but not necessarily news of any more importance than that on other pages.

Page 2 had smaller advertisements and notices of sales and from Councils and various other public organisations. Classified advertisements were very few. This led to local news. There was very rarely editorial comment.

Page 3. This was a page largely of news, especially of the various efforts to support the war and also news from the surrounding districts. The division between pages 2 and 3 was very fluid.

Page 4 carried both large and smaller advertisements, many of them local. There was a varying amount of news, mostly of less importance and sometimes there was only advertisement.

The literary supplement continued as a loose double-sided sheet: see table.

The paper was dominated by war news with many letters from soldiers and especially the efforts of Burra and district to raise money for the various funds. These efforts are reported at great length and with great care to acknowledge all financial donations, gift items and other assistance. Jingoism is relatively restrained, but not entirely absent. It naturally appears in reports of some of the stirring speeches at major events.

Numbering of issues in 1915

The apparent intention to begin each year with a new volume number breaks down.

The year began with Volume XXII Number 1926 on 6 January 1915.

And continued to Volume XXII Number 1975 on 24 November 1915.

Within this sequence numbers 1953, 1954 & 1955 were not used.

Presumably through an accident the volume number then changed:

Volume XXXII began with Number 1976 1 December 1915

And continued to Volume XXXII 1979 22 December 1915.

Editorial on The Holidays.

Burra was quiet with a rush of people to the seaside and elsewhere. The weather was extremely hot, especially on 28 December, which ended with a long and severe thunderstorm and 65 points of rain.

On Wednesday another storm dropped 16 points. On Monday 4 points fell in the town, but there was a deluge to the east in patches. Koomooloo got 50 points and Woolgangi 32.

Business was brisk on Christmas Eve and Christmas day was very quiet.

New Year’s Eve was unusually quiet. 1916 arrived without any shouting or other noise – just a general wish for peace.

Miss Edith Cave again provided the Christmas tree at the Burra Hospital on 22 December. The grounds were decked out in flags and Japanese lanterns. A fine program of music accompanied the distribution of gifts.

Percy Fuss is about again after being critically injured in a train accident on 11 September.

Burra Boy Scouts. 17 members had a camp on Saturday at Princess Royal, by kind permission of Mr J. Tennant.

Mr J.T.F. Johnson, head of Burra School, has been moved to Moonta after 5 years. He was active here in cricket and golf clubs and was a local preacher and Circuit Steward for the Kooringa Methodist Church. He was also active in patriotic matters. He is replaced by Mr C.J.W. Mundy.

There was a picture show in the Institute in the evening to bring further revenue to the fund.

The Wounded Soldiers’ Fund will benefit by about £20.

Hill, who is so ill in Egypt. So we now have photos of C. Lord, J. Bailey, J. Field, Winders, Wahlert and Hill.

Cpl J. Murison’s letter is printed. He tells of the scene near Ypres and of the plight of Belgian refugees.

Burra Town Council.

Police Commissioner approves the storage of the fire reel in the police yard.

Bridger Ltd will send a representative to give information on a possible electric light supply and power plant.

Cr A.J. McBride has presented to the Council two 18 pounder high explosive shells: the first turned out in SA. They were made by Murray Aunger Ltd.

Cr Radford complained of larrikinism in Aberdeen on New Year’s Eve. Paint was splashed on windows, gates unhinged, and a buggy placed under a verandah.

Mr H. Wilson said he was on duty and there were five mobs of larrikins around. There was no paint evident when he had been around Sara’s Corner at 3 a.m.

Cr Killicoat thought the special constables’ appointment was a slur on the soldiers present in the town.

Cr Lane said they had been appointed before it was known that any soldiers would be around.

Cr Killicoat wondered what they could do to help Pte Ockenden to get a job – it would help recruiting to show the town caring for returned wounded soldiers – perhaps he could be trained for the telephone exchange.

The Mayor said the Government had made provisions and wounded men needed to apply.

It was decided that the Mayor interview Mr Ockenden to ascertain his wishes.

Local Board of Health.

The Adelaide Hospital reports admitting Elsie Rosenthal and Tommy Halls.

[Later made clear they were the two meningitis cases mentioned in the previous paper.]

Letter of condolence sent to the parents of Pte Jones who died from meningitis.

[The report here suggests that the arrangements for the transfer of the two patients to Adelaide were botched at the Adelaide end, but only permits inferences on what happened – the ambulance seems to have failed to meet the train. See later for more details.]

In the last fortnight there have been three cases of typhoid and three of meningitis.

The typhoid has been attributed to unhygienic milking conditions in Burra.

The Mayor outlined the events of the Sunday outbreak of meningitis. Dr Ramsay-Smith in Adelaide had recommended the transfer of the patients to Adelaide, but insisted that travel arrangements etc. had to be handled by the Local Board of Health. After much difficulty the Mayor had got the Medical Superintendent of the Adelaide Hospital to arrange for the police ambulance to meet the train. He then had to pay the fare of the nurse and patients to Adelaide. A carriage had been reserved and the patients admitted to Adelaide Hospital.

Cr Killicoat said Pte Jones case was sad; he had been placed in the isolation ward, ‘a shed not fit for a dog to live in’.

Cr McBride said he had not been there, but in a room at the rear of the hospital.

Of the cases sent to Adelaide he said the nurse and her patients were left in the carriage at the Adelaide Railway Station for two hours without a soul coming to help. Finally a nurse arrived with an ambulance and the two nurses had to get the patients into the ambulance as best they could. He thought a complaint to the Central Board was only fitting.

XXXIII, 1981, 12 Jan. 1916, page 3 [Note new volume.]

Burra Institute Annual Meeting.

Rev. J.H. Nield took the chair. Two of the committee had died in the year: Dr Sangster jnr and Mr W.S. Thomson. The President (Rev. J.H. Nield) had been given nine months leave for war service, but had returned due to illness, though he had recovered sufficiently to resume duties as President. In October Dr Steele had resigned due to his war duties. In July J.E. Pearce and W.E. Hodge joined the committee.

At the end of 1915 the library held 4,442 volumes.

The membership in the year had fallen from 138 to 124.

The financial position was good.

The Orchestral & Choral Classes were much disturbed this year by the illness and then the death of Mrs Dane.

During the year a new escape door was placed on the northern side of the hall.

A fire proof box has been erected around the picture operator’s machine and panic bolts fitted.

Elected for 1916: President, J. McLaren; Vice-President, J.E.H. Winnall; Treasurer, T.W. Wilkinson (who has been so for over 40 years) & Secretary, J. Drew.

Mr & Mrs J.T.F. Johnson were farewelled at the close of the War Intercession Service at the Kooringa Methodist Church last Wednesday. [Details in c. 1⁄2 column.]

[Mr Johnson was headmaster of Burra School.]

Soldiers’ Aid Soc. Fund at £164-18-6.

Burra Rifle Club. On 8 January the shoot was led by E.A. Riggs 92, from N.H. Pearse 89.

Obituary. Mrs T.W. Rabbich (Elizabeth Jane) of ‘Kondening’, Williams WA, died after a fall from a cart when the horse made a sudden rush forward. She landed on her head. She was 62. The deceased was born in Kooringa in 1854, the daughter of the late John Boundy. Mr Rabbich was Mayor of Burra for a number of years. [Born Elizabeth Jane Boundy 11 March 1854 District of the Murray.]

[Williams is about half way between Perth and Albany.]

[Actually he was Mayor only from December 1892 to November 1893, but he was North Ward Councillor December 1880 to November 1882, December 1888 to November 1892 & December 1894 to November 1896, though he received leave from Council when he went to WA in July 1896.]

Ptes E.S. & C.J. Williams & Tpr F. Gebhardt were accorded a farewell at Leighton Hall with I.J. Warnes in the chair.

Belgian Relief Fund. A further £25 has been forwarded to Lady Galway’s fund to make the total forwarded £1,125. The total raised stands at £1,201-9-3.

Burra Cheer-up Society.

Pte Carpenter’s parcel was sent to him and as soon as we have addresses parcels will be sent to Pte Wilmott, Pte Pryor and the two Ptes Williams.

Condolences were sent to the family of Pte Jones.

At the general meeting on 10 January the Mayor took the chair.

There was some discussion about soldiers who had not come to socials to receive farewell parcels.

[In fact the tone suggests that it was felt they had somehow shirked their duty in not attending and the society appeared quite peeved at being snubbed, though doubtless they would have denied this, had they been challenged on the point.]

Mr Milner said the fund should be audited – having had £1,352 handled to the end of December.

Mr Lawn regretted that Pte W. Jones had had such a quiet funeral. He thought the Society should pledge themselves never to allow one of our soldiers to be buried ‘as this young man was’. The fact was that it had occurred on a public holiday and no one, not even Mr Crewes, had known when the funeral was to be held. It was resolved to place a wreath on the grave.

E.J. Harris referred to the designation of the room in the Adelaide Cheer-up Hut as ‘The Burra Hall’. The name was on a small brass plate about the size of an envelope and he thought something better was warranted.

Mr F. Harris had spoken to Mrs Seager and said the Society was displeased with the way in which the name of the Burra Hall was exhibited, as Burra had done so much for that hall. Mrs Seager promised to see that the present plate was replaced by a large scroll, and would like it to be unveiled by somebody from the Burra Branch. It was resolved that a letter of thanks for this be written.

Ptes Lihou and W.J. Herbert have sent photos to the Burra Cheer-up Society.

Mr Dawson, the teacher at Hanson is being moved to Tarlee. Mrs Dawson ran the post office

Burra Town Council.

Main Road Grant for 1916: £277.

Position with respect to bridges.

A deputation from Council had waited on the Commissioner of Crown Lands and asked that the three bridges destroyed in the floods be replaced, as the Council had no funds. This was unsuccessful. Later an inspector came up and reported on the sites and said the bridges would cost £1,200 or £400 each. Another deputation then asked the Commissioner to grant £600 on the assumption that the Council would fund the other half. The Commissioner said that money was tight and he would do what he could. The Council was to call tenders for one bridge and erect that and when money was freer the other two could be considered. After considerable debate Cr McBride moved that the Commissioner be informed that the Council would accept the tender of Harland for No. 1 type of bridge and, if the Government approved it, asked them to grant the money as promised.

The Mayor reported that the tar heater would be completed that night.

Cr Lane moved that tar dressing be carried from the Post Office round Commercial St. Carried.

Cr Radford moved tar dressing be done in North Ward, where previously carried out, except for two chains in front of Ridgway’s which were not in a fit state for it. Carried.

Local Board of Health.

For the month 9 cases of typhoid were reported.

The Central Board of Health to be asked if the Local Board was responsible for expenses incurred when typhoid cases were sent to hospital.

Burra Hospital had written alleging such was the case.

Burra Hospital asks for an explanation why Elsie Rosenthal and Tommy Halls were removed.

The Mayor was doubtful about explaining this: ‘The letter ought have been written in a little different tone.’

Burra Hospital Furnishing Fund stands at £471-3-5.

Annual Seaside Trip. A meeting on Monday night in the Council Chamber was told a special train to Henley Beach or Semaphore would be £76-16-0 and to Brighton £82-16-0. Heavy traffic on the line would prevent a trip to Semaphore on a Saturday. It was decided to go to Henley Beach on Saturday 19 February. Mr Mundy was appointed secretary. The balance on hand from last year was £17-4-2. Fares would be 6/- and 2/6 for children. Copperhouse, Booborowie, World’s End and Leighton Schools would be included. [Tarlee School had organised a trip for 17 February for all stations between Saddleworth and Hamley Bridge.]

Burra Cheer-up Society continues to make sandbags – 470 were sent off in the last week. Pte Rogers of Spring Bank was given the usual Cheer-up parcel.

Belgian Relief Fund at £1,204-9-3.

Burra School. A subscription list has been opened for a presentation to Mr J.T.F. Johnson, headmaster, who has been moved. Mr Oldham has been welcomed in Mr Thomas’s place and Mr Mundy replaces Mr Johnson.

Burra Rifle Club. The final shoot for J. Carr’s kitbag resulted in a close finish. R.D. Pascoe and J.A. Riggs both shot 94 ahead of N.W.R. Pearce & G. Herbert on 92, followed by N.H. Pearse & A. Sugars with 91. This resulted in a shoot-off for the kitbag between N.W.R. Pearce & N.H. Pearse, which was won by the former 95 to 93. [Shoot-off a result of the aggregate scores for the series.]

Soldiers’ Aid Society. On 31 January Hampton children will hold a bazaar in Jubilee Hall. Two beds have been presented to the Burra hospital. Chaplain Captain Durnford writes from Alexandria acknowledging parcels despatched to them. The fund stands at £192-3-101⁄2.

Burra Hospital Board: meeting of 13 January.

Local Board of Health to be informed that the hospital will hold them responsible for the cost of infectious cases sent to hospital. They requested a full explanation of the arrangements made and the manner in which patients were sent to Adelaide on 3 January.

Proposed to assess several chronic cases with a view to their removal to the Home for Incurables.

New Men’s Ward to be named McBride Ward. The Women’s Ward to be named the Victoria Ward and the Surgical Ward to be called Nesbit Ward. The old portion of the hospital will be thoroughly cleaned.

New Education Act. The key provisions of the Act are printed. Attendance now became compulsory from 6 to 14 (previously 7 to 13) and attendance was required on every school day, but a child who gains a Qualifying Certificate may leave any time after turning 13. The Qualifying Certificate will allow the child to attend a technical or high school. Children within compulsory ages must not be employed in school hours or outside them if it handicaps them in doing their schoolwork. Persistent truants may be committed to an institution.

[Significantly, given the war, was the provision that the education given each day had to be through the medium of English for at least four hours. This was aimed at the system of German language schools in the state.]

West Burra Copper Mine. 5th Half-yearly Meeting: Saturday last at Burra Institute.

While no large body of payable ore has been found, some rich bunches have been found at both the 50’ and the 100’ levels with some samples of high grade. The winze has been sunk to the 100’ level and workings are now well ventilated. The half year cost of work and management was £226-5-0 and the company is in credit £360-9-0. So far drives and crosscuts total 473’. The shaft is at 152’ and winze of 38’. It may be advisable to send a parcel of 10-20 tons for smelting as copper is now at a very high price. The proposal is to test the width of the lode at 100’ and sink a winze on the course of lode to water level. Confidence was expressed in the directors.

Burra Hospital. When the new hospital opened on Tuesday there were nine members of the Woollacott family in beds: T.H. Woollacott Sen., Miss Bessie Woollacott, Mr T.H. Woollacott jnr, Mrs T.H.

Burra Hospital. The Chief Secretary said in his opening remarks that the Burra Hospital was obtained from SAMA, but Mr J.A. McBride said the hotel was bought by Mr White, a private schoolteacher, whose business collapsed when a public school was opened. He bought it from Mr Paxton. Knowing nothing of hotel keeping Mr White did not prosper and he asked Mr McBride’s advice. Just at that time there was a move to establish a hospital and tenders had been erected for the erection of a building opposite the present mill. Mr McBride suggested that the hotel would make a good hospital and the building committee bought it for £1,000 and even though they had to compensate the contractor a large sum was saved in building.

[This account is clarified by reference to the papers of 1877.

The original proposal was to use the old Mine Hospital known as Bleak House.

The contract for enlarging and converting this building went to G. & W. Sara for £1,791-14-0. (See paper of 12 Jan. 1877)

Expenditure on the eventual hospital up to the time of opening was £1,893-0-11. (See paper of 2 March 1877.)

The conveyance of the hospital from SAMA to the Council was signed later: see the paper of 18 May 1877.

SAMA asked the Council for £583-10-8 as purchase money for the hospital and interest, with the deed to be handed over on payment. Payment was passed by Council: see the paper of 20 July 1877.

There is no mention of payments to White. Presumably White had bought the business and a lease, since it is clear that SAMA held the freehold.]

Burra Hospital. The new building was opened on Tuesday last week by the Hon. A.W. Styles, Chief Secretary. He was accompanied by Mrs Styles and the Chief Inspector of Hospitals, Dr Morris and Mrs Morris. Mr Styles gave a speech, which is printed. In it he outlines the hospital’s history.

Preliminary steps were taken in 1875.

There was a need because Burra was then the railway terminus and the centre for a very large district.

A public meeting was held to take subscriptions etc.

The old Burra Hotel was purchased from SAMA.

Initial subscriptions totalled £2,000 and after a short time the hospital was proclaimed a public hospital.

In 1915 the Government had contributed £1,496, the public had subscribed £24 and the paying patients had contributed £380.

Of the eight public hospitals in SA the Burra Hospital was the only one that had a contract with the Government in which the latter agreed to make up any shortfall in funds needed for its upkeep.

In 1911 the Board asked that the building be renewed.

The old building had by then had £6,118 spent on it.

The new building cost upwards of £4,000.

Mr Winnall responded. He said the Government did not in fact make up for any deficiency, but limited its input to £1,500 (dating from c. 12 years ago). Economies effected by the Board had reduced the subsidy to below that figure. The average number of patients any year was 276. The main problem with the building was the number of steps within it.

I.J. Warnes thanked the ladies who had raised about £600 for furnishings – though he admitted that there had been one donation of £250.

[The acknowledged subscriptions so far amounted to £521-15-5 from a report on the same page.]

The new buildings comprise a Men’s Ward, a Women’s Ward and a Surgical Ward. The Committee has provided 30 beds and mattresses at £6-10-0 each, plus new pillows, bed linen, wire blinds and doors, verandah curtains and railings.

‘Wet it’ writes wondering why the water is turned off ‘pretty well every night’.

Kooringa Court, 4 February.

Jessie Margaret Halls was charged on the information of her husband Thomas P. Halls Jnr with the embezzlement of £31-0-6 between 13 December and 30 January 1916.

Thomas P. Halls Jnr charged Hilton Grow with embezzlement of £24-10-0 between 13 December 1915 and 30 January 1916.

Thomas P. Halls Jnr was also charged by his wife with assaulting her on 3 February.

The embezzlement cases were adjourned to 10 February and the assaults to 4 February.

On the resumption of the latter Thomas P. Halls Jnr was charged with assaulting Hilton Grow on 3 February, but counter-charged his own wife and Grow with assaulting him on 3 February.

Halls objected to W. Crewes being on the bench because ‘he Mr Crewes has got his knife into me’ and has had since a municipal election some years ago. Crewes remained on the bench with T.W. Wilkinson.

Mrs Halls:

Last Thursday Halls told her that Hilton Grow has signed a statement at Halls Senior’s house alleging misconduct between Mrs Halls and Grow. Mrs Halls had denied it and Halls had struck her each time she had, with a clenched fist and kicked her in the stomach, tipped a water-bag over her to revive her and then struck her again. Then Grow drove up in a cab and Tom called him in. Mrs Halls asked Grow about the alleged statement of which he denied all knowledge. Grow told Halls to stop hitting his wife. Halls pushed Grow over the back of the chair he was sitting on. Did not actually see Halls strike Grow as she was escaping at the time. She denied hitting Tom with a coffee pot or that Grow hit him with a frying pan. He accused me on Thursday morning of impropriety with Grow. Grow drove my luggage to my sister’s. The children (four of them) are with Halls.

Hilton Grow.

Confirmed what had happened up to Mrs Halls’ escape. He denied signing any statement. Said Halls had attacked him after Mrs Halls left, but he had got away after a minute or two. There has been no impropriety.

Thomas Halls Jnr.

Returned home from hospital after recovering from typhoid on Sunday. He accused his wife of impropriety with Grow, alleging she had been found on the bed together. She admitted Grow had been on the bed, but she was only tickling him. Told her he was finished with her. Noticed her bags were packed and said that looked like guilt. Repeated the conversation to Grow when he arrived and that was when both of them attacked me – she with a coffee pot and he with a frying pan and fist. She fell on her head climbing over the wall. He admitted to striking Grow, but not his wife: pushed her, but never hit her. I said nothing about a signed statement. At one point everybody was hitting everybody else. Untrue I pushed Grow over the chair. Wife was pretty regular in attendance at hospital while I was there.

Judgements:

T. Halls Jnr v. Jessie M. Halls & T. Halls Jnr v. H. Grow were both dismissed with 5/- costs in each.

Jessie M. Halls v. T. Halls Jnr. Defendant fined 20/- with £1-1-0 costs + 15/- court fees.

H. Grow v. T. Halls Jnr. Defendant fined 10/- with £1-1-0 costs + 15/- court fees.

Redruth Court, 2 February.

R.H. Bruce v. E.A. Nankivell in a claim for £39-5-0 being the balance owing on a contract for wages, conveyance, board and lodging etc. – amended to £38-10-0.

The plaintiff had been employed by Philip Nankivell who died and he had been asked to continue to work by Miss E.A. Nankivell. He was eventually non-suited on a technicality that he should have sued Miss Nankivell personally and not as executrix of the estate. The SM thought that in justice the defendant should have allowed the claim to continue on its merits, but had to agree that technically she could object as she had.

Robert Fairchild v. I.J. Warnes. Mr Bright for the plaintiff.

A case for £30 for the use and occupation of land, or in the alternative £30 damages for trespass.

This arose out of a contract for sheep agistment on the plaintiff’s land in the Hundred of Ayers.

Plaintiff:

Am owner of sections 473 & 474 in Hundred of Ayers, comprising one paddock of 180 acres. Defendant asked the plaintiff in August 1915 what he wanted for the feed in it. Plaintiff said 3d per head of sheep per week. Defendant said it was too cumbersome to count sheep and offered £50 for the feed until the end of September. Plaintiff agreed for sheep to arrive in two weeks and stay for the last two weeks of August and the whole of September. Near the end of September Warnes agreed to remove the sheep and pay by cheque at the end of the term. A cheque for £50 was received on 8 October at a farewell to a soldier at Leighton Hall. There was no means of getting a receipt at the time, but the sheep remained in the paddock. Plaintiff wanted to put his own sheep in on 19 November. Defendant said he had the use of the paddock till the end of March. Plaintiff believed the sheep were there till 4 January. He estimated the feed at 50 tons of self-sown hay. A low estimate of the value would be 3d per head. The plaintiff had based his claim on 1d a head.

Another dispute arose over another paddock of 80 acres of good feed for which the defendant paid £5 for its use till the plaintiff wanted to plough it.

The defendant, through Mr Winnall claimed he had bought the feed for £50, provided he didn’t start ploughing before 1 October. On other paddocks paid £5 – because the plaintiff said he would start ploughing in two to three weeks. £50 cheque was paid in front of Bagot, Shakes & Lewis’s office in Kooringa on 7 October. If the judgement is that I have to pay for October, November and December that would not in Warnes’ opinion have been worth more than 50/-. Warnes had no recollection of any function at Leighton about 1 October. The cheque had not been handed over at Leighton Hall.

The verdict was for the plaintiff for £15 plus costs.

Local Board of Health.

Concerning the meningitis cases sent to Adelaide.

The Police Ambulance left the barracks at 7.10 p.m. and returned at 10 p.m. The train arrived at 7.22 p.m. and at 7.45 p.m. the Central Board of Health was asked by the Adelaide Stationmaster to make arrangements. At 8 p.m. Nurse Wylie of the Central Board left home and arrived at the station at 9 or 9.05 p.m. and the patients were transferred to hospital. The Local Board had to make all arrangements as the Central Board had no power to act. The Mayor had understood this matter with respect to responsibilities, but had relied upon an understanding by the Superintendent of the Adelaide Hospital to organise the transfer from the station. The central Board also advised that the Burra Hospital could not recover costs of infectious disease cases sent there by the Local Board of health unless some agreement had been reached.

Cr McBride said there was an agreement.

The Town Clerk said no: one had been proposed, but had not been finalised. The Hospital Board will be asked for its authority to charge any amount.

Ultimately it was decided to call a public meeting to see how the appeal could be best handled.

Soldiers’ Aid Soc. fund stands at £211-1-4.

Burra Town Council.

The Commissioner of Crown Lands has approved the tender for the bridge opposite the Institute for £215 and the Department will pay half.

Cr Lane said that in view of the estimated cost of the three bridges being £1,200 and the Department offering to pay half, this offer of half of £215 seemed poor and the Commissioner should be interviewed.

Cr McBride said as he remembered the Council offered to erect the three if they were given £600 and subsequently the Government offered to give favourable consideration to paying for one bridge if tenders were called.

Cr Dane said the Government could interpret half the £215 as ‘favourable consideration’.

Cr McBride will wait on the Commissioner and if settled satisfactorily the tender is to be accepted.

Burra Hall.

The tablet bearing the name of the hall was unveiled by the Mayor of the town, Mr E.W. Crewes, on Saturday morning at the request of the Society’s President, Mr W.J. Sowden. The donations from the Burra Town and District roughly equalled the cost of the hall and their contribution was being acknowledged by naming it the Burra Hall. The hall will also contain a picture of the great demonstration at Burra on Carnival Day, which was opened by the Governor. Mr Crewes gave a stirring speech. Burra Cheer-up Society had now raised £1,500 in cash. Of which about £360 had been invested to help local boys in particular. In the district about £15,500 had been raised for the war effort by various agencies and funds. Lately they had concentrated on the local hospital and had raised c. £600 for it. [‘They’ here means the community rather than the Cheer-up Society.] Some 300 men had now enlisted from the District. The tablet was unveiled. Under the direction of H.J. Henderson it had been artistically prepared from Burra copper.

E.J. Harris, Secretary of the Belgian Fund, writes assuring ‘Warm Feet’ that the fund would be only too happy to accept any donations, is still very much alive, and has a total of over £1,200 and is still growing.

Burra Show Soc. met on Friday. Last year it was decided the profit would go to the Wounded Soldiers’ Fund. The Secretary read the report. They started 1915 in credit £47-1-5 and ended in credit £164-17-4. The profit was £117-15-11. This included £39 of returned prize money and the sale of a ram presented by Messrs H. Collins & Co. for £63. It was resolved that the Secretary’s salary of £50 for 1914 & 1915 be a charge on the money in hand prior to the show. It was resolved to donate £130 to such patriotic funds as might be decided, leaving c. £12 to meet any outstanding liabilities. There was then debate about what the 1915 resolution had meant – did it mean only The SA Wounded Soldiers’ Fund? Some thought the idea was that and others that it was more generally for wounded soldiers. Eventually Mr Winnall gave notice he would move that the motion giving all profits be rescinded and if that were carried, would then move that £130 be paid to such war funds as the committee deemed advisable.

Burra Town Council.

The Government will advance the total cost of the bridge opposite the Institute, but half will have to be repaid in five equal annual instalments.

Cr Radford thought the Government was very reasonable and suggested they be asked to finance the bridge at Gully’s on the same terms.

Cr McBride thought it would be cheeky, but Cr Radford was serious and so moved.

Cr McWaters thought it absurd. A bridge was not needed in Aberdeen. It would only be used for the show and races. He moved as an amendment that the request be not sent. Carried.

Mrs Richards of the [Court House] Hotel, Aberdeen [i.e. Redruth] was given permission to keep pigs.

Bridgers Ltd said they could not raise capital to construct an electric light scheme during the war, but would happily negotiate on the matter after the war.

Mr Winnall explained the lease of the creek to Hon. John Lewis. It was for 99 years, giving the lessee right of way for stock from Kingston St Bridge to below the Mill for £3-15-0 p.a. or 5% interest on the money paid for the creek. The portions needed were shown on a plan: the rest could be fenced and planted.

Cr Killicoat was against a lease, saying it ought to be open to all as a stock route. The lessee could block the route to others. Mr Winnall did not think Mr Lewis could block other users, but he could impound straying stock or stock at large on it.

Cr Radford was concerned as well, apparently along similar lines to Cr Killicoat.

Mr Winnall thought Mr Lewis would agree to the route being a right of way for all travelling stock.

Cr Killicoat said that no lease was needed; let the route be a proclaimed stock route for all time.

Mr Lewis will be asked if he would be satisfied with no lease, but it being proclaimed a public right of way and so registered on the deed.

Mr Winnall pointed out that Mr Lewis had given the Council the option of purchasing the creek on the condition he got the lease.

Proposed Sheep-breeders Association. Up to 1913 the Burra Show was held in September and served the sheep-breeders well, but the move to October, which was better for farmers, does not suit the pastoralists. The later show is better for the public and consequently a meeting of pastoralists was held on Friday to consider holding a separate sheep show. A special meeting of the Show Soc. is called for to consider the matter.

Soldiers’ Aid Soc. No further sandbags will be made for the present as needs have been met. The fund is now £214-11-5.

Burra Hospital Furnishing Fund is now £534-10-5.

Burra & District Ambulance Fund. The Mayor chaired the meeting last Wednesday at the Institute. Agreement to help in raising money came from H. Morgan representing Mongolata, Mr Tiddy as Sec. of the Soldiers’ Aid Soc., George Ley as Chairman of Hanson DC and Miss Trix Pearce for the Cheer-ups. The Mayor also said the Commercial Travellers had promised to do something. E.J. Harris moved for a day for a united Burra & District Demonstration. Support also came from the Red Cross Soc. and from representatives from Farrell’s Flat, Booborowie, Mt Bryan and Hallett. Indications already are that the fund can easily get one ambulance and eyes are set on three. Messrs A.J. & Phil McBride have, through the Cheer-up Soc. offered to fit up one of their big cars and hand it over fully equipped, so that is No. 1. Has someone else a big car: the ambulance committee is prepared to put the top on. Donations so far:

General £99-16-0

From Cheer-up Soc. £50-15-6

From Soldiers’ Aid Soc. £37- 1-6

£187-13-0

A demonstration is planned for Wednesday 19 April. The Military Authorities have been asked to give a demonstration of trench digging and wire entanglements. Shopkeepers will be asked to close all day.

The Dearlove Family have sent a cheque of £22-14-0 to the Ambulance Fund and also Harry & Archie Dearlove are about to go into camp.

Utica Mining Co.

Annual Meeting of shareholders was held on 8 March. A.L. Walker presided. G. Sampson was elected a director to replace J.M. McDonald who retired.

The engine and pump have been disposed of to Horwood & Co. of Adelaide for £110. Proceeds will have to go to the Government. No mining has been done since the last meeting, but with copper at £108-£110 per ton this meeting will have to decide on the desirability of recommencing developmental work. The ore on the surface should certainly be sent for treatment and it may be advisable to see if it can be augmented from work at 100’. We are in credit £100. If we decide not to go on then all property of the company should be removed from the mine and placed in the care of the secretary.

Redruth Court.

T.P. Halls jnr was charged by his wife, Jessie Margaret Halls, with cruelty and wilful neglect to provide maintenance. She applied for custody of the four children and reasonable separate maintenance. Mr Bright appeared for the plaintiff and sought to add cruelty in August, September, October and November 1916 [sic] [presumably 1915]. This was disallowed.

Jessie M. Halls:

Married 8 February 1908 and had five children, four of whom are living. The eldest is 7 and the youngest 19 months. Lived unhappily with defendant till his admission to hospital 13 December 1915. Married at 16, when he was 22. The unhappiness was the result of his bad temper and drinking. He was in hospital 7 weeks with enteric fever and I visited daily till meningitis broke out and I was quarantined. He has been a cab proprietor for 12 months and had two cabs and four horses with receipts of £8-£11 a week. While he was in hospital T. Halls Senior drove the cabs and kept the fares. Hilton Grow drove the small cab and paid me £24, which he said he had received in fares. When I showed the defendant the memorandum of receipts he threw it down and demanded the money and then beat me and told me to pack up and get out.

[Details are then given of the disagreement with Grow that had already been before the court and of financial matters. Much more detail is given of the alleged impropriety with Hilton Grow, aged 17.]

The defendant admitted swearing false oaths in charging his wife and Grow with embezzlement and the SM said that tainted any evidence of his that was uncorroborated.

T.P. Halls Senior:

Swore to seeing his daughter-in-law commit acts of gross impropriety with Grow and of seeing them in the same room three or four times. [He also said he still owned the cabs etc.]

The SM concluded that much of the defendant’s jealousy and bad behaviour resulted from his recent illness and neurasthenia. The bench believed he had assaulted his wife as described and then had her locked up on a false charge. Cruelty and failure to provide maintenance was proved. A separation should be granted and custody of the children, also defendant to pay 30/- a week to the State Children’s Council in Adelaide. Professional costs of £4-4-0 were awarded against the defendant.

Burra Show Soc.

A general meeting was held on Friday in the Liberal Union Rooms. The President said he had been approached after the last show about a separate sheep show, as the date of shows near the end of October was unsuitable for sheep breeders.

As President of the Pastoral Assoc. he could not ignore it, but as President of the Show Soc. he could not move against its interests.

Mr E.W. Van Senden spoke and felt that a show at Burra under the auspices of the Burra Show Soc. in August or September would not clash with the Adelaide Show.

H.H. Thomas supported a sheep show.

Mr Hawkes pointed out how sheep breeders had to fit in with other shows, and not only with those in SA. For the Sydney show in August the sheep had to be shorn in July. HE favoured a pastoral committee for the Burra Show Soc.

M.A. Radford also favoured a separate sheep show. He thought a committee should be appointed at once to get things going.

Mr Winnall proposed that the society was prepared to hold a sheep show on a separate day from the general show. Mr Hawkes 2nd. Carried 17-4. A committee of twelve was appointed.

Burra Town Council

S.J. Harland wrote saying that since he tendered for the suspension bridge there had probably been a rise in the price of materials, furthermore 4” wire rope was now unobtainable, but 31⁄2” was approved by Crown Lands Office.

The Overseer reported that the best road metal was from the hill near the Burra School. A letter will be sent to Hon. J. Lewis asking the price per acre for land near the school. The same is to be asked of owners of blocks in front of the Mill.

Hon. J. Lewis has offered to pay 12 months rates on Paxton Square only. Mr Winnall advised acceptance of the offer as the properties were not on the assessment book till last August and it was doubtful if they could claim more than 12 months rates. Accepted.

Cr Radford said the fire reel had now been under construction for four months! Without a reel the hose would soon become useless. The contractor is to be given 10 days to complete the work or the job will be taken elsewhere.

Given the dilapidated state of the Redruth Court House the Mayor supported moving the court to Kooringa. The SM, Mr Hinde would support such a move. Pearce’s Building would be suitable and Mr Pearce would consent to letting one or two rooms as offices, plus the main hall as the Court House. Council supported the move, as the Redruth Court was entirely out of the way and Kooringa was the centre of business.

Local Board of Health.

Burra Hospital writes referring the Council to the Health Act [for its power to charge for the hospitalisation of infectious diseases cases. The whole matter of who was responsible for both the treatment and the payment seems to have been quite confusing for the Local Board.]

A conference with the Hospital Board will be arranged.

Fire at the Old White Hart Hotel.

On Tuesday night last week [14 March] the old White Hart Hotel was nearly all destroyed by fire. It was used as the home of Mrs A. Sara and partly by the Boy Scouts for their gatherings. The house belonged to Mr James Reed. It was one of the oldest buildings in the town, being built 65 years ago. [1851] It comprised 22 rooms and was not insured. The fire broke out when no one was at home. The Boy Scouts were at the Institute giving a concert and the alarm was raised during the interval. Captain Truscott was raised by the bell rung by Mr Crewes. He got the hose and hydrant, but then had trouble getting to Aberdeen. Several cars sped past without stopping and eventually Mr Lord got his car out and took Mr Truscott to the fire. They arrived within 20 minutes of the fire being discovered, but lack of practice still delayed then from plying the fire with water. The front part of the house was then saved. Mrs Sara’s furniture had already been largely saved except for the kitchen and her own bedroom. The Scouts’ Rooms and equipment were saved. In the process the water from the hose brought down a ceiling on top of a number of men, but fortunately it was lath and plaster and did little damage except to blacken them. The origin of the fire is unclear, but perhaps a spark in the kitchen was responsible.

John McLaren writes concerning the ‘extraordinary action of the Council repudiating an agreement of a former Council’. If there are no minutes of such an agreement the Town Clerk is at fault as it was a regularly called special meeting. Particulars should also have been noted by the Council’s solicitor (Mr Winnall) attending for that purpose.

When SAMA decided to sell the creek the Council asked that it be dedicated to the town.

SAMA, as a public company, decided it couldn’t do that.

The area in question extended from Kooringa to the Mine Bridge and on to the rear of the Mill and the Council had no rights to any of that or to any crossing between the Black Bridge and the rear of the Mill, except for Ursula St, near the Burra Hotel.

To maintain access between their yards and the railway station, Bagot, Shakes & Lewis would have purchased the whole length of the creek, but Council thought it should be under municipal control.

Mr Lewis used his influence to get a definite price placed on it of £150 and could have bought it at such a price, but waived his right in favour of the Council, on the condition that Bagot, Shakes & Lewis had the grazing rights and pay £3-15-0 p.a. (5% on half the value.)

This gave the Council the right to plant and fence such portions as they wished. Three large crossings were to be left in agreed positions.

I consider Council should sign the lease as agreed. If there had been any thought that such would not be done the registration of the transfer could have been delayed till both it and the lease were ready together.

F. Harris writes saying Burra Cheer-up Society balance sheet will be published in May, at the end of the financial year.

‘North Ward’ writes expressing amusement at the attempts of the Council to get money from the Government. First they wanted £600 for three unnecessary bridges when £100 would do all that is required. At the last meeting of Council they endorsed the Mayor’s agreement to borrow half the cost of the proposed bridge in Kooringa. Can the Council borrow without ratepayers’ approval? The sum is not large, but if they can borrow £100 without approval why not £1,000?

‘Warm Feet’ writes expressing approval of the great welcome accorded Cpl Sandland and Pte Stewart at the railway station.

Kooringa Court, 24 March.

Thomas Arnold (alias Westall, Weston, and Williams) was charged that between 20 & 23 March he broke into the house of Johann Gottlieb Rooke of Baldina and stole two purses valued at 2/-, £4-15-0 in cash, a gold ring, gold locket and articles to the value of £10-15-0.

The accused had been seen in the area and the purse was found on him and other items in his swag. He sold the ring and locket to Thomas Woodman. He pleaded guilty and was committed to the Criminal Sittings at the Supreme Court for sentence.

W.J. Davey jnr was farewelled at the Record office on Monday. Mr Crewes spoke of his creditable conduct and accurate reporting of meetings. He presented Mr Davey with a handsome travelling rug. Various people spoke including Messrs Drew, Milner, E.J. Harris, F. Harris, & A. Walker. Mr E.F. Marston endorsed all that had been said. On one occasion for six months Mr Davey had been entirely in charge of the Record and on Mr Marston’s return everything was entirely satisfactory. Mr Davey has joined the staff of the Horsham Times in Victoria.

‘Ratepayer’ writes condemning any move to shift the court house from Redruth. Repairs must be cheaper than ongoing rent. Quietness would be out of the question in Pearce’s Building with three nearby garages. The present location is quieter, has good areas for horses and vehicles, has four hotels for accommodation and is nearer the station.

E.J. Davey writes in reply to Mr McLaren’s letter. The meeting referred to was not a regularly called special meeting, but a hastily summoned one called together verbally to suit Mr Lewis, who was that day in town. He [McLaren] says he has heard there were no minutes taken. He was the Mayor, and should know. He should have ensured minutes were taken and that they were correct. The only reference in minutes is that an agreement was to be drawn up by Mr Lewis’s solicitor and submitted to Council. This has now been done, but because one clause would practically give Messrs Bagot, Shakes & Lewis a monopoly over the route, the present Council has objected to this clause. The Council desires the route to be kept open for all travelling stock.

‘Ratepayer’ writes saying Mr McLaren’s admission and his idea of excusing himself is only worthy of a politician. Such regular meetings were frequent when he was Mayor. If regular, was it in order? When were the minutes confirmed? There is no doubt that as Mr McLaren says had he expected to be beaten for Mayor he would have certainly finalised things previously. ‘What is stirring him now, his interest in Burra, or, as per usual, other quarters!’

J.C. Killicoat also attacks John McLaren ‘for his absolutely slack management during his abruptly-ended regime as Mayor’. He ‘characteristically blames someone else’. I fail to see where the Council repudiates any agreement, they are merely being businesslike and keeping the interests of ratepayers before them as first consideration.

## Ambulance Day in Burra.

The committee has received an offer from Mr Lester of Theatregraph Pictures to give ‘all above usual proceeds’ to the fund. The Mayor has been authorised to buy an Overland or an Oakland subject to Military approval, so it might be in Burra for the day. Someone had suggested that Mr Crewes would get a handsome commission on the purchase – well he hoped he would – as large as possible, and the fund would get every penny of it. The Trench Digging Committee had reluctantly concluded the idea was impracticable. There were not enough young men in the town now to carry out the work and if let to tender it would cost £30-£40.

The procession would start at 11.45 from Aberdeen.

A Punch and Judy show was to be obtained if possible.

A concert and an auction will be organised.

Mr A. Walker is organising a sideshow where for 6d everyone will get a prize.

Burra Show Soc. AGM last Friday. President’s Report.

He makes reference to the war and the splendid season, in marked contrast with the previous one.

The Sheep Dog Trial on 30 & 31 July had record entries and for the first time the Championship Cup of SA was sent on from Strathalbyn and won by Mr A. Collins with his dog Rap.

Unfortunately the trials were not a financial success.

The show was held on 27 October, mainly due to the lateness of the season – it was an unqualified success. There were record entries almost everywhere except in sheep (due to the lateness of the date.) There was a record attendance and the return of considerable prize money yielded c. £130 for the patriotic funds.

The balance sheet showed a profit of £130 of which prize money returned was £39. Sale of a ram presented by H. Collins & Co. yielded £63 and there was a £5 donation from E.F. Marston.

The President said a luncheon room was required at the grounds. A tent was hardly suitable for entertaining such visitors as the Governor. An iron building 60’ x 30’ would do. Perhaps they could issue debentures to finance it.

R. Fairchild suggested that the profit was more or less fictitious, as over £100 of it had been returned for patriotic purposes.

Elections for 1916-17: Patron, Hon. John Lewis; President, I.J. Warnes; Vice-Presidents, T. McWaters & A.D. McDonald.

There was considerable discussion re the meaning of the original motion to donate to the Wounded Soldiers’ Fund, because there was a Central Fund and a Local Fund. Mr McLaren thought that when it was passed the Central Fund was meant and he strongly opposed any other course. [SA Wounded Soldiers’ Fund] Mr A.D. McDonald thought it was not specified originally which patriotic fund and H.H. Thomas favoured giving some to local bodies. Mr Winnall was sure that when Mr Crewes moved the original motion the local fund would have been in his mind – he is after all President of the Burra Cheer-up Society, which initiated it. The motion to rescind the original motion was lost 20 to 11 and the whole £130 was voted to go to the SA Wounded Soldiers’ Fund.

He became engaged to Miss Frances Hicks on the way out and they were married on arrival in Burra in the old Church of England on Limestone Hill by Rev. J.C. Bagshaw. He brought the first team of horses to Burra for the Patent Copper Co. and worked on the Mine for 20 years. For a time they lived in one of the historic dugouts until he built a brick house in Redruth. In his spare time he put the roof on. Due to high transport costs he carried all the timber from Kooringa on his back. He sold his creek residence for £3 shortly before the flood that washed out all those huts. Mr Pinch’s was the first house in Redruth. Later he bought a farm of 704 acres and held it for 18 years before selling it to Mr J. Cockrum; though later still he re-bought it and handed it to his son-in-law. He then retired to Redruth. He was much involved in public life. He was a District Councillor for three years and Chairman of it for some of that time. He was a Town Councillor for two years. He was also for a time a Member of the Burra Hospital Board and a member of the MUIOOF Lodge for 65 years, twice being NG. He was also a Freemason and was Master of that Lodge in 1886. Mrs Pinch died in 1912 aged over 90. The couple had celebrated their Diamond Wedding in 1909. There were two children: Mrs E.N. Finch & Mrs Josiah Thomas.

Ambulance Day in Burra was held last Saturday, 15 April. It was a huge success. The morning was cold and somewhat threatening, which reduced attendance somewhat, but the afternoon was very pleasant. The 43rd Battalion Band arrived by train. They did a fine job supplying delightful music to help the day along.

The procession was led by M-Cs McCarthy & Kain, then Mounted Boy Scouts with Scoutmaster Rigney. Then came the Red Cross Tableaux and the Burra Band under Mr Shortridge. The ‘Bruce’ Stall attendants came next with the ‘piano’ for 6d. This was followed by the Boy Scouts’ cart especially fitted up in grotesque and fantastic style as ‘Hann’s Imperial Chariot’ and Rainbow Tableaux. A zeppelin followed that inscribed with several labels: ‘Billy’s Baby-Killer’, ‘His Sausage Majesty’ & ‘William the Weed’ etc. The school children then came along before John Bull and ‘The Allies’ before a Hay Scene and then ‘Warm Feet’, which featured Charles Burns, F. Harris, P. Milner, F. Dew & boys, the Birtle Bros on bikes, Messrs Glenister & N. Burns. Next was The Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe with about 20 children and then Nation’s ambulance, a clown, the Rag-Time Band [A group of female musicians], followed by the star of the show, Burra & District Ambulance No. 1. Decorated traps and motorcars brought up the rear with ‘His Satanic Majesty’ (not the Kaiser).

At the Square a splendid marquee had been set up for lunch and afternoon teas. Mrs C.J. Pearce was in charge of Paddy’s Market, while Mr A. Walker ran the ‘Bruce’ Stall. There was a pie stall, a lolly stall and The Burra Bunyip, but some boys who gave the game away by revealing it was only a huge pumpkin in disguise, reduced the latter’s takings to only 9/6.

Mr Hann ran a mock Bruce Stall, promising to take down all the people and succeeding very well. His bag of chaff turned out to weigh only about 2 oz and his coil of wire was about 6” of hat wire rolled in a coil. He collected £4-5-9 in sixpences. The real Bruce Stall took £93-15-6.

The Westminster Warblers were a great success. They appeared on Robertson’s motor lorry as a band of niggers and gave some good songs. The day’s takings were c. £500. [Subscriptions before had exceeded £224.]

At the luncheon the Mayor welcomed the 43rd Battalion Band. A few months ago Burra had quite a good band, but now about half had volunteered. Although Burra & District had subscribed over £15,000 in various appeals it was felt something else was wanted and so they decided on an Ambulance Day. They had started with the idea of one ambulance, but at present there was every prospect of four.

XXXIII, 1995, 19 Apr. 1916, page 3

Towards that they already had £400 in cash and Mr J.M. McBride had promised a donation of £150, while Messrs A.J. & Phil McBride had decided to give an ambulance complete.

Messrs Pearce Bros [sic, for Pearse] of ‘The Gums’ had promised to submit a 30 h.p. car to the authorities and if suitable would have it fitted up as an ambulance. He thanked in particular Mr J.M. McBride: his name as a philanthropist was a household word throughout SA. During the war Mr McBride had given: to the Belgian Fund £3,600

to the Serbian Fund £2,750

to the Salvation Army Field Service £2,000

to other funds smaller amounts

Total £10,900

To which another £1,000 would shortly be added.

Mr Hawkes gave a patriotic speech after the Mayor’s, ending with a patriotic poem by Will. H. Ogilvie that had been published in London Punch.

## Sunday Concerts

On Sunday the Military Band gave a concert in Best Place. The mayor announced that Mr J.M. McBride had now decided to personally give a fully equipped ambulance and also to donate £50 towards paying off the instruments of the Military Band, which he understood was in debt to that amount. Chaplain-Captain Cuttriss gave an address including the remark: ‘There was no word in the English dictionary which described properly a man who could and would not go, the only thing to say was that he was “worse than a German”, we knew were [sic] the latter stood, but it was impossible to say how the shirker, the dawdler and the postponer stood.’

In the evening the band played in the Rotunda. Captain Cuttriss again appealed for volunteers and believed ‘the church should make itself one of the most active agents to send men, money and munitions.’

‘The war . . . was a contest for supremacy between the Devil and God.’

The collector then played on north-south rivalries in the town in order to collect £55.

Mr Lester gave £19-18-6 from the picture show.

Soldiers’ Aid Soc. The fund stands at £224-5-11 and £54-15-4 has been sent to Burra & District Ambulance Fund.

Burra Town Council.

The Mayor said the fence at the station yard had to be moved back. It intruded onto the road 1⁄4 of a chain (16.5 feet) and was unsafe. Matter to stand over pending an inspection.

The contractor for the suspension bridge was granted an extension of time.

Letter from Messrs Bright & Bright for J. Lewis threatening legal action unless the Council gave the lease it was alleged they had agreed to.

Cr Killicoat said the objection to an exclusive right was that anyone crossing from Princess Royal would be stopped and would have to go to Farrell’s Flat.

The Town Clerk was not sure Mr Winnall had written to Hon. J. Lewis on this point as he was away. All correspondence to be reviewed and a decision made on the reply at next meeting.

The Inspector said the land offered by R.M. McBride as a quarry was unsuitable, but there was a suitable site in the old mine.

Cr Killicoat asked if there was ever a motion passed to fence Best Place, as some ratepayers were anxious a portion be fenced.

Cr Lane said there was a motion that it not be fenced. It was thought that if it were fenced off level there would not be a chain road. The Government had taken away the water troughs when they took over the water supply, but it was not with the idea of fencing.

Cr Killicoat asked if the Council would object to a monument there. The first three soldiers to die were from Aberdeen and it was the intention to place a monument there in best Place.

Cr Lane said, though this was a worthy idea other men had fallen also and it was the intention of Burra & District to erect a monument to all.

The Mayor said there was the nucleus of a fund to erect a monument in Market Square. He would prefer a single monument for all and would not subscribe to one that was for Kooringa boys only.

Ct Killicoat said that personally he would not subscribe to a separate monument to any great extent. His brother had died, but he intended to place a memorial window in the church.

Matter deferred for further consideration.

Local Board of Health.

The Hospital Board have agreed to a conference about infectious disease costs.

Burra Hospital Board, Thursday last.

The Chief Secretary wrote warning against the Board paying unnecessary interest [on an overdraft] because the Government sent a cheque every month to meet liabilities.

Bur Mr Harcus said it often came up to 10 days after the end of the month and it would not be fair to keep staff waiting for wages. Mr Warnes moved that accounts other than staff wages be held until the Government remittance arrived.

On 16 December Dr Ashton wrote that the Matron had told him it was impossible with the present staff to give the special attention he needed for certain enteric fever patients during a recent severe outbreak. He asked for steps to remedy this deficiency.

The secretary asked for clarification of the closing statement, which referred to the consequences of this problem in Reice’s and similar cases.

An Acknowledgement has been received signed jointly by Drs Ashton & Williams:

‘Your notes of the 11th inst. have been received.’

The Board was indignant at what seems to have been a decision not to answer their request at all and were also annoyed and puzzled by Dr Williams’ signature, as the case referred to occurred before he was in town.

Mr Gebhardt wanted individual replies.

Mr Crewes thought the Doctors should be asked to a conference with the Board and Mr Warnes so moved.

Mr Hawkes said the letter was not only rude, but also intentionally rude and a conference would achieve more than letters, which could easily lead to unpleasant developments. Motion carried unanimously.

The Board agreed to meet with the Local Board of Health on the issue of responsibility for the payment for infectious diseases cases referred by them to the Hospital. Mt Bryan Local Board of health wrote accepting responsibility. Hallett agreed to pay without accepting any responsibility to do so. Their attention is to be drawn to the Act.

Mr Hawkes said something had to be done about the Isolation Ward. It was an abomination and a veritable death trap: like a camp oven in summer and an ice-chest in winter. It was an iron structure.

Mr Warnes moved the Government be written to pointing out to them that the Board felt it endangered the life of any patient placed in it.

Other urgent work was cellar accommodation, ward wash-up house and a ramp to the new buildings from the operating theatre and the removal of some of the old buildings. Request that they be allowed to get the work done locally, but at Government expense.

Capt. D. McDonald Steele, after a short illness, has been RMO to the 16th Battalion near the Suez Canal for almost three months now.

Burra School Board of Advice was dissolved with the new system and was to be replaced by a Committee of Seven. The old board offered itself, comprising: Messrs McLaren, Winnall, Lane & E.J. Harris, but no one else came forward. Mr Mundy, headmaster, has asked the Minister if he will nominate the three required members.

Anzac Day yesterday was remembered at 9 a.m. when businesses, trams and trains were asked to stop for 2 minutes.

The Juvenile Foresters Annual Picnic was held on Monday. It went well until about 4 p.m. when rain forced an early departure. It was held at Sod Hut and was served by Streicher Bros’ charabancs.

Education Act. Recent changes now require a doctor’s certificate for every day absent. This is clearly unworkable and also discriminates against the poor.

Burra Cheer-up Society.

On the afternoon of 25 April we entertained 24 soldiers who were welcomed as usual by Mr Crewes. Rev. A.J. Finch was welcomed for the first time since his arrival in Burra. The soldiers present were: Sgt F. Thomas, Ptes Honan, Hunt, Preiss, A. Harris, L. Harris, Turner, K. Drew, Bowen, Cullen, G. Hill, Fitzgerald, Fuller, Ockenden, Morgan, White, Humphris, T. Harrap, A. Gebhardt, Morgan, Nelson, L. Lafsky, R. Henderson and L-Cpl Manson. [The two Morgans were probably E.B. & G.H.]

‘Indignation’ writes that it is with a mixture of amusement and disgust that I read that the Hospital Board considers the isolation ward a ‘death trap’ etc. They are obviously aware that for more than 12 months the nursing staff were compelled to use these apartments for their sleeping accommodation!

Newsprint.

A deputation of representatives from 700 country papers has asked the Minister of Customs to assist in getting newsprint from Canada and the USA. New Zealand has already acted on this. The cost of paper has risen form £15 to £40 per ton and papers will not be able to continue at this price – or not beyond the end of 1916 at any rate. Mill prices have changed little; it is the transport costs that have rocketed. Aid was promised.

Deteriorating Mail Service.

Until about two years ago mails for the morning train closed c. 5 a.m. Then they closed at 10.15 p.m. This practically prevented mails received by the evening train being answered by return. Now there is a move to close at 6 or 8 p.m. A letter written Monday evening would not be delivered in Adelaide till Wednesday morning and the same applies to Broken Hill. It was also promised that with sufficient subscribers the phone service would be continuous, yet on Sundays it is available for only a few minutes at a time.

Anzac Day in Burra. The Mayor presided at the Burra Institute with Rev. Father Kett, Rev. A.J. Finch, and Rev. D.B. Bridgwood. (Rev. S.J. Bloyd was absent from Burra.)

Mr Crewes read the names of the Burra enlistees who had taken part in the Gallipoli Landing:

Newton King, Essen Rule, Fred Wheatley, Fred Harvey, George Thomson, Vernon Day, Hartley Harris, Arthur Stewart, Eric Roach, John Camp (killed) and Harry Skinner (missing).

He gave a short speech, followed by a few words from Rev. Father Kett, who recited the Charge of the Light Brigade. This was followed by the hymn, For the Men at the Front. Rev. A.D. Bridgwood then spoke and was followed by the hymn, Onward Christian Soldiers.

Rev. A.J. Finch was briefer, but equally full of the sentiments of the others and the evening closed with the National Anthem and God Bless Our Splendid Men.

Boy Scouts. Having lost their room in the fire at the White Hart in March, they thank Mr Sedgman of the Waterworks for a large room in which to store equipment etc. The room will now become their headquarters. The scouts recently got a letter from Fred Fuller, who is on the training ship HMAS Tingira.

Burra Town Council.

A letter will be sent to the SAR telling them that in the event of an accident they would be held responsible for the misplaced fence. Several near accidents have occurred.

The offer from R.M. McBride to sell blocks 8 & 9 in Graham for £30 is rejected. The offer of another block from Roach & Son for £100 was also rejected.

Cr McBride said his firm would be happy for them to open a quarry on the mine property for a royalty. The inspector reported good quality metal there. Offer accepted.

The premises opposite the Institute are to be moved further along (away from the new bridge) and painted. [Presumably this refers to a toilet block.]

The Town Clerk read a letter from November 1913, which contained the adopted minute re Hon. John Lewis and the Burra Creek lease.

‘The Council should reserve certain parts of the creek as they may require for planting, which should be marked on the plan and then granted your firm (Bagot, Shakes & Lewis) a right of way over the creek, excepting the reserves, in perpetuity at a nominal rent.’

The Mayor said the agreement submitted by Mr Lewis was totally different.

Mr Winnall will be asked to draw up an agreement in line with the above clause and submit it to Council for approval and inform Bright & Bright that this was being done.

It was pointed out that this did not give Bagot, Shakes & Lewis the sole right of way along the creek.

Local Board of Health.

The Inspector said two cases of diphtheria and two of enteric (typhoid) fever and one of measles were reported in the last two weeks.

Alexander Black’s Costume Comedy Co. on Wednesday last drew a small audience after only short notice of their visit. The quality of the show deserved a much larger audience, which they will get if they return.

Soldiers’ Aid Soc. Knitted goods continue to be made and despatched. Guy Tiddy has resigned as correspondence secretary, as he has enlisted.

Burra Cheer-up Society.

The Adelaide branch of the society is having a big fair in the Adelaide Exhibition Building on 18 & 19 May and donations for a ‘Sing a Song of Sixpence’ stall are being requested (i.e. items to be sold for 6d.). Parcels have been sent to soldiers unable to be at our recent social: Ptes Voumard (2), Kelly (2), Parker & L. Griffiths. D. Kelly has written back with thanks.

Lady Galway is editing a book of 182 pages on Belgium, including 26 views and 16 other pictures. 2,000 copies in an exclusive edition at 7/6 each will raise £750 for the Belgian Relief Fund if all are sold. The Publishers, Hussey & Gillingham are donating labour and material.

‘Visionary’ writes deploring the lack of any are that could be developed to encompass tennis courts, hockey, bowling greens and a garden. The only possible site is occupied by Paxton Square.

‘It can hardly be contended that these are an ornament to the town.’ For the price a few better modern replacement cottages could be erected for the old people sheltering there now.

## XXXIII, 1997, 3 May 1916, page 4

The All-British League. A branch was formed in Burra at a meeting called by the Mayor on Thursday evening last. He worked himself up into a fine patriotic fervour reading from a speech delivered by the Kaiser in 1908, which outlined the latter’s plans for world domination. The Mayor went on to say that ‘no one blames a German [in Australia] simply because he was a German or of that descent, but it was expected that everyone with German blood in his veins who lived in a British community and enjoyed British liberty and prosperity, that they should stand up and declare on all possible occasions that they had no sympathy with the Kaiser and his brood.’ Etc., etc.

In church one man could sing the hymns, but was dumb when the National Anthem was sung. In Market Square some omitted to take off their hats when the National Anthem was sung. Should Britishers take these insults? The Government was still giving jobs to Germans when Britishers volunteered for the front. The Mayor then read the objects of the league and people who joined should be prepared to carry them out to the letter.

Mr Pederson said that according to the rules he was not eligible to join, not being of British lineage, but he had seen German armies overrun his own country [Denmark] in 1864 and had suffered under German rule. This was sufficient evidence that the movement had his sympathy. Many years before he had been a member of the volunteers.

Mr Lane gave it his support as did Mr Milner.

Mr Lawn thought it should have been long established.

Mr W.H. Pearce moved that a branch be formed and W. Lee 2nd.

Mr Crewes was elected President and Mr Horner, Secretary.

Vice-Presidents are: Messrs I.J. Warnes, E. Cock, T. Sandland, A.J. McBride, John Tennant, R.J.M. McBride, W.G. Hawkes, J.M. McBride & P. McBride.

Ambulance Day Results. Ambulance Day produced one ambulance from J.M. McBride and one from Messrs A.J & P. McBride and raised in cash nearly £900 despite the fact that the highest donor gave £25. This is a magnificent effort from those in moderate circumstances. It is well known that some of the wealthiest have given practically nothing to the war effort. They are prepared to stand by and let another man be smashed up in their place and then refuse to help even to carry him to hospital. And they have the enormous audacity to point the finger of scorn at young men who haven’t the courage to plunge into the maelstrom of war itself.

At a meeting of the committee it was decided the Mayor should hand over the ambulance already bought, to the Military authorities as soon as possible. The other three will be presented as soon as they are ready and it was decided to do this at a ceremony. Clem Sampson, H.L. Pearce and Clarence Humphrys are to be recommended as drivers.

After all expenses are paid some £20-£30 will still be needed to pay for the two ambulances.

Supreme Court, Adelaide.

Thomas Arnold (50), who admitted to stealing from the dwelling of Johann G. Rooke at Baldina on 23 March, was sentenced to five years. He has a long history of offences and was warned that another offence would see him liable to be declared a habitual criminal.

Disputed Will.

The last will of William Develaing, who died 30 October 1914, was disputed.

The plaintiffs were Mary Develaing and Mrs Bell, for a will dated 29 October 1914, for which they were executrixes. Defendant was Sarah Honan, through her guardian Maud Mary Honan.

The plaintiffs’ claim was for probate to be granted.

Defendants claim was the will was not properly executed and the proper will was another made on 19 March 1914. Both wills were drawn up Mr Winnall.

Mr Winnall:

Was called to make the second will when the deceased was very ill because he had married on the previous day. The witness considered the deceased understood the new will. Mrs Short was in the room. The testator signed with a mark.

Mary Ann Develaing said she had lived with the deceased 15 or 16 years in Kooringa and had been known as his wife all that time. The deceased owned four houses in Kooringa. She was not sure she was present when the testator signed the new will. The instructions for the new will, she said, were it was to be the same as the old one except for the omission of a bequest of two houses to Mrs Bell, his daughter. The will as prepared did not conform to this. It left out the bequest as instructed, but made other alterations not authorised.

His Honour considered that because of the state of health and age of the patient he could not accept as conclusive that the testator was aware of differences between the instructions and the terms of the will. The will could not stand. This was no reflection against anyone. He made no order in favour of the plaintiffs regarding costs. Defendant to have costs out of the estate.

Burra Rifle Club. Saturday shoot. A. Sugars 100 led J.E. Pearce & E.A. Riggs each on 99.

Volunteers. Two more from the district: George Giles (Mt Bryan) & J. Griffiths (Aberdeen).

Burra Hospital.

A document in the possession of Council shows that not only is Council the trustee of the Hospital, but also its registered owner. In 1877 the property was sold to the Council by SAMA for £500. This makes rather comical the struggle of the owners to get a representative on the Hospital Board of Management. Also recently a great portion of the old building was demolished and a new one erected without reference to the wishes of the owner. More recently the Council was told that if some monetary arrangement were not arrived at they would have to isolate cases of infectious disease somewhere else.

Film made in Burra.

Denver Dixon, the American cowboy who has been here recently has now written and produced the first drama to be filmed in SA. Stockman Joe stars Denver Dixon as hero with locals of Burra as the villain, heroine, reckless-riding stockmen, etc. The main scenes were shot around the mine.

During the late epidemic of enteric (typhoid) fever the Burra Hospital sent accounts totalling over £300 to the Local Board of Health. The Local Board of Health received them, but took no action, holding that it had not authorised the admission of the patients, nor had it made any agreement to pay. Eventually they asked for a conference with the Hospital Board for last Thursday.

Mr Winnall

Also present were the Town Clerk, Mr E.J. Davey & Burra Hospital Secretary, Mr F. Treloar.

Mr Crewes said an attempt at an agreement had been made years before, but had failed. He believed the Local Board should be responsible only for the debts of the destitute.

Mr Winnall said:

The Local Board was responsible for isolation cases of infectious disease.

They could make arrangements with anybody to that end and would be responsible for such payments as agreed upon.

There were two doctors in town: one was health officer.

The Hospital held that the Local Board was responsible for all cases admitted by the health officer even without an agreement: a view endorsed by Dr Morrison, the Inspector General of Hospitals.

The Hospital Board could stand by the law and refuse to admit cases without authority.

The Local board would have either to provide authority or find another place of isolation.

As for those already admitted it was a question of whether the Local Board would stand behind the law or treat the matter in a fairer spirit and accept responsibility.

They could collect the fees from the patients and hand them on to the Hospital.

If the Local Board attempted to evade payment the Hospital could refuse all infectious cases.

Something had to be done, as the Hospital could not meet its liabilities.

[Mr Winnall then said that in Adelaide they paid 30/- per week for infectious cases and he thought that would serve, BUT as typhoid cases were not dearer to treat than non-infectious diseases the hospital should waive its claim in that respect. This seems odd since the whole issue of the £300 liability arose over a typhoid outbreak and if the hospital waived its claim for that against the Local Board presumably much of the £300 would remain their problem. Presumably all that Mr Winnall was prepared to waive was the gap between normal charges and infectious disease charges because typhoid treatment actually involved no greater cost.]

Mr Winnall said at Kapunda the Local Board paid a flat £40 p.a. and at Jamestown it was £30 – as a sort of insurance premium.

Mr Lane could not see how the annual lump sum solution solved anything – at least not in an epidemic. The Adelaide agreement was for 30/- a week for infectious cases, typhoid excepted, plus £1 for burials and the cost of removing patients to hospital.

Mr Winnall said the local burial charge was £3.

The Mayor suggested that the Local Board collect what it could from patients and hand it over as a full discharge of past debts and then apply the Adelaide agreement for the future.

Mr Hawkes was not impressed.

After further discussion Mr Winnall moved that an agreement similar to that in force in Adelaide be put in place. Carried.

With respect to accounts already rendered a committee of three are to be appointed to work out a compromise.

Both the Boards met separately subsequently and endorsed this resolution of the problem.

Mr W.B. Martin, an old Burraite, writes from Thames in New Zealand with some brief reminiscences on the past.

Soldiers’ Aid Soc. Currently the main work is making sheets and towels for the Red Cross Convalescent Home in Adelaide. 850 sandbags were sent off this week.

John McLaren writes re a proposed railway line from Wentworth to Morgan. He suggests one from Wentworth to Burra would serve more country, as there is already a Paringa to Adelaide line.

[In any event neither line was built.]

‘Burra Every Time’ writes recommending a Roll of Honour in a public place at the Institute to record the names of all volunteers.

The Editor comments that the Council has already resolved upon a roll of honour for the Council Chamber, but the more public location seems like a good idea.

Burra Town Council.

A.J. & P. McBride have offered to allow the Council to raise metal on the mine property free of charge, provided the site was kept fenced.

4-5 chains of the west wall of the cemetery are in need of repair. To be done.

Cr Lane said that as there was a good balance in the account a bridge should be put in George St. He said the bridge would require to be c. 88’ and he believed it could be done for £1 a foot.

Cr Killicoat thought the Aberdeen Bridge was needed more.

[This produced the usual north-south division on the two bridges.]

Estimates will be obtained.

Council will inspect to see what type of bridge is needed at the Mine Bridge.

V. Riggs writes, dated 26 March, of their train trip from Marseilles to near the Belgian border.

Cpl Bob Crewes writes, dated 27 March, from France, also of the trip from Egypt and the train journey north to the front.

Burra Hospital Board.

They discussed the communication problems between the isolation ward and the rest of the hospital.

The telephones in the hospital were questioned. There were two – were two still needed? [While not spelled out, this appears to refer to two direct lines to the town’s two doctors, which were installed before the town exchange became a continuous service – and possibly before there was a local service.]

The Matron appeared to have appointed a probationer nurse without reference to the Board, which provoked considerable discussion. The Chairman went to the Matron. On returning he reported that she said they had needed a nurse urgently and on consulting Mr Bartholomaeus and Mr A.J. McBride they had told to write and tell the young lady to come. But this was a misunderstanding: they had intended only that she be sent an application form. There was then much debate about what sort of nurse was required – a charge nurse or a probationer. Mr McBride said that the doctors had worked on the staff and made them feel that the Matron and seven nurses were insufficient. After further discussion about the new probationer nurse it was decided to ask her to put in her application along with others to be considered next Thursday.

The Chief Secretary wrote to say a new isolation ward, scullery and cellar accommodation was being considered. A letter of explanation was received from Drs Thomas B. Ashton & A. Evan Williams.

In Riece’s case a delirious typhoid patient died suddenly after sitting up in bed. The probationer nurse explained she had to leave the patient alone because she had patients to see in another ward. This was reported with recommendation that further nursing strength be made available. The Board had misconstrued this as an attack on the nursing staff and passed a resolution ‘That Dr Ashton had been grossly unfair to nursing staff.’

We submit that cases are recommended by us as fit cases for treatment in the hospital in a medical sense, in our capacity as private medical practitioners and that the Board has no power to dictate the conduct of our private practice, but can refuse patients admission to the hospital at their own discretion; hence our terse acknowledgement of the Board’s effort.

The Board must make its own arrangements with the Local Board of Health for responsibilities for payment for infectious cases.

The lack of a definite understanding concerning the admission of infectious cases complicates the conduct of private work in the town and district.

The resolution of the Board placing obstacles to the admission of ‘children of tender years’ is especially prejudicial to the interests of children suffering from diphtheria and other acute diseases. There are only two fully qualified nurses, including the Matron and the probationer nurses, mostly in the early part of their courses, if worked excessively, have no time for the study to fit them for their future profession.

Consideration of the letter was postponed and the medical officers will be asked again to meet the Board.

Burra Hospital Board.

Drs Ashton & Williams failed to attend the meeting held last Thursday.

Miss G. Berriman of Saddleworth was appointed Probationer Nurse.

Matron clarified the confusion over the previous appointment of a probationer and the Board accepted it was a misunderstanding.

The Superintendent of Public Buildings gives no hope of a cellar, wash-up house or new isolation ward till the war ends. In the meantime wooden ramps will be made where needed.

Mr Winnall & Mr Gebhardt said they were a waste of money and too steep to be used – one was a slope of 1:5.

The Board reviewed the case of Dr Ashton’s complaint about inadequate nursing.

The Board considered Dr Ashton had first attacked the nursing staff, then when the patient had admitted being drunk; he shifted his ground to the inadequate numbers of staff. When asked for an explanation the two doctors merely acknowledged receipt of the letter and had now declined to attend a meeting of the Board. Dr Ashton refused to attend until the censure motion was expunged.

On the 12 December a motion had been passed requiring an order from a member of the board for admission to the hospital etc. This was awkward.

On 12 January this was rescinded, with the effect that in practise the doctors could now admit whom they chose. The register of patients to be read at Board meetings.

Mr Hawkes thought the doctors would come and the whole thing be settled if the censure motion was rescinded.

Mr Winnall was in the chair and objected to any recantation.

Dr Ashton did not complain at the time and resigned in January, when he left the town. The membership of the Board had changed greatly during Dr Ashton’s two-year absence and it was a direct insult that the doctors would not confer with it.

Mr Hawkes said that after the alleged unfair motion Dr Ashton had attended meetings, then resigned and finally accepted re-instatement under the Board which had insulted him.

Mr Warnes moved that as the hospital was meant to care for destitute persons; all persons treated should be free of all fees except hospital charges. In regard to the vote of censure he recalled that the Matron and nurse were examined at the time, three years ago, and were now away. If the doctor was not satisfied then why did he not ask for a special conference and have the matter thrashed out again whilst the parties were in the town? The case was not specialised and the nurse had to attend to other cases. If it were so bad the doctor should have given instructions.

When anyone left an institution and returned again it was generally taken that old sores had healed. The two-line reply from the doctors was not worthy of gentlemen and an apology should have been demanded. The financial and medical management were inseparable. Dr Ashton said all he had to do was look after his private practice, but a good deal of that was done in the hospital. Medical officers were paid to look after the patients on alternate weeks. Many non-paying patients were surprised to receive doctor’s bills. Then again the doctors had free use of the operating theatres and use of the nursing staff. Concerning children, the only ones objected to were babes in arms as one of those would need a nurse to itself. If the rules were unsatisfactory why didn’t the doctors come and help to amend them? He felt certain that when they could no longer follow their private practice in the hospital they would ask for a conference. Why Dr Williams involved himself in the matter was hard to say.

Mr McWaters 2nd the motion.

Mr Hawkes felt the motion was too drastic and in admitting paying patients the doctors were standing behind hospital rules. It meant that of a person able to pay met with a serious accident and was taken to hospital the doctors might reasonably refuse to treat them.

Mr Gebhardt thought that to pay them £75 p.a. without the right to treat private patients would not be reasonable.

Mr Harcus thought a reply sent to the doctors’ letter might bring them to a more reasonable state of mind.

Mr Crewes suggested three members of the Board interview the Medical Officers.

Mr Warnes: Crawl to the doctors!

Mr Crewes: No. Matters were critical and they had to think of the patients. He moved an amendment that Mr McBride and Mr Hawkes wait on the doctors and discuss the question.

Mr Warnes then suggested it all be put to the Chief Secretary for guidance.

Both the motion and the amendment were lost.

Mr Warnes suggestion about the Chief Secretary was then carried.

Australian Pastoralists’ Assoc. Burra Branch had its AGM last Friday. I.J. Warnes was re-elected President with Mr T. McWaters as Vice-President. The report extends for 11⁄2 columns.

W.B. Page, having been appointed Secretary of the Liberal Union and having removed to Adelaide, was farewelled at St Mary’s on Sunday after the evening service. He had been the church organist.

The All-British League met at the Institute on Thursday evening with the Mayor presiding.

He said the League was not out to make enemies or say nasty things about anyone.

Mr J.H. Clouston, Mayor of Pt Adelaide and General President of the All-British League spoke of its aims:

Foster national ideals and keep alive patriotic spirit.

Defend British freedom, rights and privileges against German aggression.

Defend British industry and labour against German competition.

Fight German influence in social, financial, industrial, municipal and political life.

Guard against the ascendency of any language over English in state-aided schools.

Remember the Lusitania, the rape of Belgium, Nurse Cavell’s murder, etc. He spoke of the League’s growth and against Germans in high places – naming Messrs Meucke & Basedow, who had been MPs, and of Mr Schomburg and of German language in schools and German language newspapers, which had continued till recently. Mr Owen-Smyth also spoke on the history of German aggression since 1863, of German economic plans for domination and the need to buy nothing of German manufacture. Rev. John Warren then spoke on the German goods issue and the need to drive all Germans from public office. During the evening the Institute Orchestra played and the Messrs Ewins and Glenister sang a duet. [Somewhat ironic given that Glenister was born Schneider.]

Weather. Welcome rain has been falling. Mr Hardy reports that to the east falls have been significant. Quondong got 25 points and Old Koomooloo 19. Most other places fell in between. Redcliffe recorded 30 points. [This would suggest that Hardy was still the telephonist for the Eastern Telephone Exchange.]

Burra Show Soc. has decided to get quotes for a luncheon booth – an unlined galvanised iron shed either 60’ x 30’ x 14’ or 60’ x 30’ x 12’ with a 7’ roof without a floor. The agreement with the Recreation Ground Syndicate has expired and a new agreement is needed to acquire security of tenure. Up to now use has been free, but all permanent buildings become the property of the Syndicate. The Syndicate’s view of the proposed building will be sought.

The Collins Brothers have lost two valuable sheep dogs to a poisoner two days before they were to compete at Strathalbyn.

The Temperance Party is out to end the alcohol booth at the show. Mr Thomas urged this in view of the war and the example of the King. He will seek a hearing at the General Committee or even at a General Meeting.

Empire Day was celebrated at the school on 26 May.

Obituary. Mr William Gerard died at Miss Hill’s Hospital aged 73. He was a colonist of 50 years, arriving with his wife in the Trevillian in 1866. He was a resident of Burra for 44 years.

Burra Cheer-up Society, First Annual Report.

The group first met 15 May 1915 in a room at the Institute. The aim was to give all those who were leaving for the front a happy send-off, to assist soldiers in various other ways and to support other patriotic efforts. Elected were President, E.W. Crewes; Hon. Sec., Miss Trix Pearce; Assistant Secretary, Miss Ethel James; Treasurer, Mr F. Harris; Vice-Presidents, S.M. Lane, E.J. Harris, G. Lawn, E.F. Marston, J. McLaren, R. Jones & P. Milner.

Ladies Committee: Patron, Mrs A. Seager; President, Mrs J.H. Nield; Vice-President, Mrs W. Thomson.

In the year the membership grew to 334.

We soon procured a room free of cost from Mr J. Pearce. Monday evenings have generally been work evenings for knitting woollen comforts.

A bugle was presented to the 10th Battalion by Mrs Seager on our behalf.

Blankets, sheets, etc. were collected to equip hospitals in the city for wounded and sick heroes on their return to SA and over £250 worth was sent away.

In June we lost Mrs Thomson, who went to live in Adelaide following the death of her husband. Mrs J.A. McBride was elected in her place; though later she too had to resign on moving to Adelaide.

28 June Burra Cheer-up Society provided afternoon tea at Burra Rifle Range and on 2 July Violet Day was celebrated to raise money for the Cheer-up Hut in Adelaide and a bunch of violets was auctioned for £384. On 14 July Mrs Seager visited us.

Norman McBride was presented with a second bugle from the Society and a third went to Lieut. M. Stevenson.

Meanwhile members gathered 30 dozen handkerchiefs and 6-dozen face-washers, plus writing material and bootlaces for the troops. Six-dozen milk jug covers were also sent to Keswick hospital.

On 13 October Cheer-up Day in Burra was held to aid the Wounded Soldier’ Fund and we were visited by the Governor and Lady Galway and the President of the Adelaide Cheer-up Society, Mr W.J. Sowden. The Adelaide Society recognised the large contribution of Burra & District by naming the Adelaide Cheer-up Hut’s main hall ‘Burra Hall’. 40 Cheer-up Girls formed a mounted guard of honour when the Governor visited and they were also asked to repeat it when he opened the Cheer-up Hut in Adelaide on 4 November.

Male members formed a class to make sandbags and several hundred were despatched.

On 10 December we ran YMCA Button Day in Burra.

On 5 December we sent large parcels of woollen comforts etc. to our boys in Egypt.

Fruit & cake were sent to Keswick Hospital for Christmas and 100 billycans filled with Christmas gifts were forwarded to the city for despatch to soldiers.

In February Mr Crewes unveiled the Burra panel in the Cheer-up Hut in Adelaide.

In April a ‘Cheer-O’ concert was given in the Institute to raise money for comforts for men of the 32nd Battalion. Recently we sent four cases of pickles etc to the Cheer-up Hut and held a 6d gift evening to collect materials for a stall at the Exhibition Building for the Carnival on 18 & 19 May.

We had also sent sufficient poultry, ham and cakes, etc. to provide lunch for 300 soldiers.

Socials have been held, sometimes up to three in a week, to farewell departing soldiers and in 12 months we have given away 182 parcels of comforts for departing soldiers.

So far 11 volunteers have been returned to Burra and we aim to welcome back all returnees as we farewelled them. The Society has provided a bed in the new part of the Burra Hospital.

Recent removals from the district mean we have lost Mrs J.H. Nield and Mrs A.J. McBride. We have been proud to receive photographs of many of the volunteers and would welcome as many more as possible. Thanks especially to A.J. McBride and Mr Glenister for free use of motor vehicles and to Mr F. Robertson for never charging to transport our Cheer-up parcels.

The balance sheets for the cheer-up Society and its Wounded Soldiers’ Fund are then printed.

Significant income for the year was:

YMCA Button Day £83-18-3

Ambulance Fund Collection £103-0-0

Main Expenditure for the year:

To Adelaide Cheer-up Society £414-0-0

Obituary. Mrs William Blott died in Adelaide aged 95. She was a colonist of 62 years. She was born 4 December 1820 in West Wratting, Cambridgeshire. She was one of seven children of whom the eldest three have now died in order of their birth and all in the neighbourhood of 96 years of age. The youngest is James aged 86, who lives on the King’s Sandringham Estate. He was for many years head gamekeeper to the Duke of Cambridge. Mrs Blott came to SA in 1854 in the Octavia. She and her husband settled first at Clarendon, but soon came north and spent several years on northern stations before settling in Burra over 50 years ago. Mr Blott died at Burra 23 years ago and Mrs Blott went to live with her eldest daughter, Mrs Frank Smith. She was blind for the last 17 years and bedridden for the last four, but her memory remained wonderfully bright. She died on 25 May and has been buried at Kooringa. [Born Mary Tilbrook.]

Obituary. Samuel Burns JP died 3 June aged 58. Until 51⁄2 years ago he was noted for his strength. He then suffered a stroke from which he never fully recovered. He had another 5 weeks ago and a final one on Thursday night from which he did not regain consciousness. For 30 years he had been a local preacher. He was strictly honest in his business and very kind-hearted. He was born in Burra on 23 June 1858 and established a blacksmiths and wheelwright’s business about 30 years ago. He was a member of the Town Council for some years and Mayor for one. During his second year had to resign on account of ill health. [He was West Ward Councillor Dec. 1905-Nov. 1909 and Mayor Dec. 1909-Nov.1910. Through ill health he did not contest the mayoralty for 1911.]

He was chairman of the trustees of the Burra Burra Lodge MUIOOF and a trustee of the Rechabite Lodge. He was a prominent Freemason and Superintendent of the Methodist Sunday School. He leaves a widow, six sons and three daughters: Norman, Gladstone & Charles in Kooringa, and Garfield in Egypt with the Light Horse. Robert enlisted in Fiji and is with the King’s Royal Rifles in France. Jack is in Melbourne. The daughters are Mrs Alan Murrie of Pt Pirie and Misses Lydia & Melva of Kooringa. There are three grandchildren. Rev. J.A. Burns of Mildura is his brother.

[Death registered as 4 June 1916 aged 57.]

R.D. Pascoe’s Sheep Photographs.

[Article reprinted from ‘Bendleby’ in the Australasian.]

While commenting very favourably on Pascoe’s collection for the modern Merino there are interesting references to collections, which go much further back. One of the best collections of old-time portraits of Merino sheep is in the possession of Alick J. Murray in his Mt Crawford home. These show the evolution of the long-necked ram free from apron or cross folds such as are still seen in the Carngham flock in the Western District of Victoria. These were evolved to cope with the spear-grass seed troubles of the north. Cross folds acted as a trap for the seeds and caused endless trouble to the rams and indirectly for the owners. The Mt Crawford gallery contains some prints and engravings and photographs of old-time sheep collected by the late E.M. Pitts of the Levels and were secured by Mr Alick J. Murray after Mr Pitt’s death. For a collection of sheep in modern times nothing compares with the collection of R.D. Pascoe of Burra SA.

Not older than 12 years, it contains all of the most noted rams and ewes which have been making history in that period in SA. It began with two or three portraits of local sheep and a small case of wool from Koonoona Station.

Pte Dollard & Gunner Keynes were farewelled at Leighton on Thursday & Saturday nights respectively. I.J. Warnes presided.

Burra Hospital board, Last Thursday.

It was decided to switch from two telephones to one and to connect the isolation ward and get a switchboard.

The Chief Secretary acknowledged receipt of a letter from the Board re the town’s doctors.

Nurse McNeil has resigned as a probationer because both of her brothers had enlisted and she was needed at home.

The Chief Secretary expresses concern that the expenditure is exceeding the Government grant of £1,500 and thought more should come from paying patients.

Mr Harcus said the excess would be about £112.

The hospital financial year should be brought into line with the grant year running from 1 July to 30 June and it would be more even. This will be done.

Patient contributions varied greatly from year to year. There was a low of £242 in 1910 and a high of £726 in 1914 for instance. The secretary thought that outstanding accounts should be placed in the hands of a solicitor.

Outstanding accounts totalled about £300.

Pte Hartley Harris writes from France dated 22 April. He is presently with the 9th Battalion Band. Their billets were shelled the day before and c. 30 were killed including three members of the band. The letter was continued on 23 April, when two more bandsmen died and the band was broken up as a consequence.

Leighton Hall meeting was held to decide on the best format for soldiers’ farewells. Sometimes heated, the discussion eventually ended with a decision to have patriotic speeches, songs, games and dancing, subject to the soldiers’ approval.

Redruth Court, 7 June.

J. Duncan Kelly and Hector Bagg were each fined 5/- + 15/- costs for driving an unlit vehicle.

T.P. Halls Senior was charged by his wife Isabella Halls with acts of cruelty and improper relations with Mrs Evans, Dolly Churchman and other unknown women and with neglecting to provide maintenance from 9 April onwards.

Isabella Halls:

Before 9 April had been allowed £2 per week, but he then told me the two boys could keep me. Have been married 32 years. On 18 April said he would ‘make an Alf. Lyons [sic] job of the whole lot of you’. [This is a reference to Alfred Lines, who in June 1885 shot his wife and her lover before shooting himself.] Have seen him in the company of the women above and heard him with others unknown. Am afraid he might shoot me. About five weeks ago saw his bankbook – he had about £700 in the bank. The house I live in is my own. Would accept 30/- a week. Four children from the marriage are still alive: the youngest is 19. Defendant lives in another house, but comes to mine for dinner and tea. He had been in mental hospital for six months.

S.L.G. Halls (Joe):

Joe gave evidence of his father’s behaviour with other women and of threatening him and his brother with a revolver.

T.P. Halls:

Said they had not lived happily for the last 16 years and had not got on well with the children since they grew up. About 18 months ago my wife told me not to enter the house any more. I have given Tom £200 and Joe £110 and handed over the cabs and business to them on condition they provide for their mother. The houses belong to me and I am getting no rent. Remember saying recently I paid Tom wages to drive the cab. Never used the expression ‘Alf Lyons’ to my wife. Had no improper relations with any of the women. Brought home a water pistol: had no revolver.

The Bench decided that much of his behaviour was due to his being kicked by a horse about two years ago. Cruelty was not proven, but the improper relations were circumstantially proved and sufficient to grant a separation. Mrs Halls accepted an offer made by Halls as to assignment.

Bright & Bright sued T. Halls Senior for legal costs of £21-5-4, which arose out of a case that T. Halls Senior brought against T. Halls jnr for assault. A dispute arose over which Mr Bright had been engaged – W.S. or T.R. – who had to come up from Adelaide. Under all the circumstances the magistrate thought there should have been a written agreement and gave a verdict for £11-5-4 plus costs.

Burra Cheer-up Society. Gifts were sent to Ptes H. Pearse, Hogg, Stewart & Goddier, for whom a social could not be arranged.

Burra Institute Committee will send a letter to Mr Lester asking him to have better order maintained at the pictures.

Burra Town Council.

Mr Winnall advises that Bright & Bright have written stating that the offer made by Council re the lease of the creek was unacceptable by Hon. J. Lewis and asking whether the Council’s solicitor would receive service of a writ.

Estimate of cost of Roll of Honour obtained.

Cr Dane was against a costly roll if there was also to be a big memorial. Also there was some objection to its location in the Council Chamber.

Cr Killicoat said the memorial would be to the fallen, but the roll of honour would include all those who enlisted. Cost of having names in brass to be obtained.

S. Hyland, contractor, advises he could build the George St Bridge for £130 and one in Aberdeen for c. £160. It was decided to do nothing at present.

Cr Killicoat urged the uprights at Gully’s Wharf be removed, as they would act as a baulk in another flood.

Cr Radford said all but one were sound and might be of use if a bridge similar to the old one were to be built.

Cr McWaters said if they were a baulk, then what was the bridge itself?

The site is to be inspected.

A message of regret at the death of Lord Kitchener to be sent to H.E. the Governor.

Condolences sent to Mrs Burns and family.

The Mayor and two or three Councillors have inspected the quarry at the mine and think it is first class. All main road metal in future will come from there.

Burra Town Council.

After talking to Mr Winnall the Council has instructed him if necessary to accept service of a writ.

[E. Thamm was obviously having drainage problems and the Council Inspector seems to have been less than helpful. This may have had something to do with Mr Thamm being thought by some people to have had pro-German sympathies, but nothing of that nature is hinted at in the paper.]

An old well near the Mine Bridge is to be filled in with rubbish.

A photograph of Mr Burns is being sought for the Council Chamber.

Cr Dane said he believed Burra was the only town in SA with sufficient subscribers for a continuous telephone service, but which had not one.

The department will be urged to rectify this at once.

The Postal Department will be urged to revert to the early morning closing of mails as was the former custom.

Cr Dane complained of the lack of a men’s waiting room at the station.

Sergeant Lackman, who had been manager for Elder, Smith & Co. for about three years, was given a banquet at the Cheer-up Hall by friends and former clients on Friday evening. Mr Winnall presided. Mr Hawkes & Mr Crewes, H.H. Thomas and Cr Radford all spoke warmly of Sgt Lackman and the report extends over 11⁄2 columns.

50-60 ladies have attended meetings. We have sent 12 cases of made garments, 1 case of 100 sheets for Mareeba Hospital – each case being worth c. £20. Last 15 July we sent £60 to Adelaide Rad Cross. The branch was most active in Australia Day 1915 with other patriotic societies. In August our Bazaar raised £200, of which we sent £180 to Adelaide for medical supplies following a special request from Lady Galway. On 3 March 1916 £73-10-6 was raised at a garden fete. We also strongly supported Australia Day. On 28 April a garden fete at ‘Benacre’ by Hon. John Lewis raised £10 for the Mareeba Hospital. On 16 June Red Cross Button Day raised £200. Very cold wet weather meant a small house for the Petersburg Dramatic Co. and the sale of sweets by Miss Lane and Sister Solly produced a profit of £4-10-0, which allowed a total profit of only £5-15-9 to be paid into the general fund. In summary since October 1914:

Sent to parent society in Adelaide 324

Sent to Mareeba Convalescent Hospital 210

Given to Ambulance Day, Burra 15

Mr Killicoat said he was a member of the Soldiers’ aid Soc. and had heard no such thing.

It was agreed to go ahead with the building of a luncheon booth for £215, financed by 5% debentures. The relationship with the Syndicate over this is to be clarified.

Burra Hospital Board, Thursday.

The Chairmen reported considerable success in collecting money owed.

Mr Warnes moved and Mr Lane 2nd a move to charge anything from 2/6 to £3-3-0 a week depending on the ability to pay. At present they were charging either 25/- or nothing. Mr Winnall was vigorously opposed. If he went into a general ward he would expect to pay for that. If he went into a hotel he paid 1/- for a 1/- dinner no matter what his income. Mr Gebhardt also thought the idea ridiculous and Mr Hawkes could not imagine the board doing such inquisitorial work. Mr Crewes thought the motion a step in the right direction. Mr Winnall said if he travelled by rail he had the right to travel 2nd class and pay a 2nd class fare and it should be the same in hospital. The Chairman, A.J. McBride, thought they could increase the ward fees and allow the House Committee to reduce them where necessary. Mr McLaren sided with Winnall etc.

The motion was lost 6 to 5.

Sister Wood has resigned.

The Chief Secretary writes that the Department cannot at present provide a scullery and cellar. The Superintendent of Public Buildings reports the isolation ward is a disgrace to the Board.

Mr Warnes said the Superintendent only glanced at it.

The Chief Secretary advises that Mr P.A. McBride has been appointed to the Board.

Mr McLaren found himself unable to congratulate the appointee. It was an insult so young a man should be appointed and ‘further one whose father was the chairman and who had two uncles and a father-in-law on the Board’ – it was a discredit to many eligible people. [P.A. McBride was then 24. His father was A.J. McBride, his uncles were W.G. Hawkes and S.M. Lane and E.W. Crewes was his father-in-law.]

He moved the Board respectfully protest against the appointment of Mr P.A. McBride. Mr Warnes regretfully 2nd saying ‘it looked as though there would be a block vote on occasions. The appointment looked as though undue influence had been used.’

Mr Crewes denied any prior knowledge of the appointment. He could not see that the relationship would make any difference – he had a mind of his own.

Mr Hawkes disapproved also and concluded that the board was being made ‘a training ground for public office’.

‘He had no doubt that influence, and most improper influence had been at work. He did not impute the influence to members of the Board. As a member of the family he wished to repudiate any connection with so undesirable an appointment.’

Mr Lane denied any prior knowledge of the appointment.

Messrs Winnall and Bartholomaeus moved the motion be not put and that was carried 6 to 4.

The Chief Secretary suggested the Board appoint a special committee to confer with the Medical Officers about an amicable arrangement of their differences. This was complied with.

The six-month balance sheet showed that £900 of the £1,500 had been spent.

Mr Hawkes said they were worse off than ever before, but the Chairman said they had got in £102 this month with more to come.

Hon. J. Lewis agrees to accept the Council’s lease as offered except for the impounding clauses.

Cr McBride suggested some of the slagheap be tried for blending [sic: blinding?] and suggested a trial near the Black Bridge. Carried.

The Mayor said he understood the Aberdeen Post Office was about to be separated from the store and a postmaster appointed.

Local Board of Health.

The Inspector reported that all meat in the town came from outside and therefore the whole of the killing was without inspection.

Mr Crewes said slaughtering could be enforced in the town if the Council provided a place.

Crs Killicoat & McBride said meat was too dear in Burra as it was.

The Mayor reported that the conference with the Hospital Board resulted in the Local Board of Health honouring accounts for infectious diseases except for enteric fever. This amounted to c. £30, most of which could be collected from the patients.

Mr Winnall will draw up an agreement.

Burra & District Motor Ambulances.

Burra & District has sent 400 young men to the front and raised over £18,000 for the patriotic funds. It has now collected £850 to buy two motor ambulances for the military authorities. Mr J.M. McBride and Messrs A.J. & P.A. McBride each agreed to provide an ambulance. As a consequence the committee, of which Cr S.M. Lane is secretary, was able to hand over four motor ambulances to the Defence Department on 18 July: two Overlands, a Buick and an Oakland. The presentation was made opposite the South African Soldiers’ Memorial on North Terrace, by His Excellency the Governor, Sir Henry Galway. About 35 Burra residents travelled to Adelaide for the presentation. Unfortunately the weather was showery. Mr Crewes had the honour of asking His Excellency to make the presentation. He thanked in particular the generosity of the McBrides and Mr W.G. Hawkes supported the Mayor’s remarks. Brigadier-General Irving accepted for the defence department. These brought to 52 the ambulances presented by SA.

The prices quoted were 8d lb in Clare and 1/- lb in Burra, but in Clare the 8d refers only to the lowest quality meat and is misleading. Actually prices in Clare are Beef 8d to 1/- lb, Mutton 8 d to 11d lb and Lamb 9d to 11d lb.

Australia Day.

Half a column outlines the coming meeting of the Supreme Court in Kooringa when as many citizens as possible would be fined for diabolical and nefarious offences.

Burra Hospital Board, Thursday last.

The Board was unable to suggest any plan that would cut costs to the extent demanded by the Government’s reduction of its grant from £1,500 to £1,000.

Mr Hawkes thought the reduction reasonable. The Government could not be expected to allow over £1,000 p.a. for the care of the indigent. Since all the staff employed seem indispensable, all they could do was ask for subscriptions and raise the prices for paying patients. The charge for ward patients at present was 25/- per week, which raised £62 and the cost was c. £100. Those who could afford it should pay £2 per week.

Mr Crewes thought the Government should have given more notice and if they expected subscriptions to rise then the Board should be elected by the residents of the district.

Mr Warnes said that the district had to subscribe one sixth of the revenue before the public had the right to vote.

The doctors are considering the request for a conference with the Board.

An appeal for subscriptions will be made.

Mr Hawkes said when old age pensioners went into hospital their pensions were stopped, a procedure which benefited the Federal authorities, but not the State.

‘Bill’ writes following on from last week, gently poking fun at the Council and other town institutions.

‘Subscriber’ writes thanking the Record for reporting the Hospital Board so well and is critical of the attitude expressed by Mr McLaren etc. against the appointment of Mr P. McBride.

‘World’s End’ writes saying that if there is concern about family influence on the Burra Hospital Board, then what about the Burra District Council?

‘Chairman, son, ranger and son-in-law.’

‘Also has Mr McWaters been charging mileage right from World’s End or only from Kooringa where he lives?’

‘A Britisher’ writes complaining about the way the secretary of the Black Springs Hall is charging for its use.

Australia Day in Burra.

Would Burra produce the goods again? In the past five weeks nearly £600 had been collected for Red Cross, the YMCA and the Cheer-up Society.

The day was fine. Bunting, marquees and stalls were erected in Market Square. Souvenir sellers were afoot. By 1.30 the crowd was still thin, but by 2 p.m. it had thickened. There were a series of addresses at c. 2 p.m. Rev. A.J. Finch was followed by I.J. Warnes who scorned the wealthy men in the district who had not managed to spare even £100 and some not even £1 for patriotic purposes. Cpl W.M. Hanell, who served under Sgt Darby Killicoat, spoke.

Then Mr Hawkes spoke, followed by Mr Winnall. The Mayor welcomed Ptes James & Oates. He had been asked what sum the committee would be satisfied with and he had said £1,000 and been laughed at, but he knew he had not overestimated.

Ray Chambers of Bagot, Shakes & Lewis then auctioned a Union Jack signed by the Governor-General. The bids totalled over £900. In the end it went to J.M. McBride who had bid £210 and J. Tennant was not far behind with £200. Just as significant was Mrs Brown of Hampton’s bid of 10/-: she has little enough to spare and five boys at the front.

The Mock Court then appeared.

Chief Justice (Mr Hann), and two Judges (Messrs Glenister & Horner), Judge’s Associate (Mr Milner), Court Crier (young Jack Hann) and a bodyguard of women police.

Many were fined from 6d to 5/-. Finally M-C Kane arrested the judges, jury and police and the Mayor fined each on 1/- for impersonation.

A list is then printed of the takings from the various stalls and activities.

Total takings £1,367-8-4.

Burra Cheer-up Soc. On 31 July Driver Horace Oates was welcomed home from Egypt. A photo of Pte W. Pederson has been received. Parcels have been sent to Ptes Duldig and Muller, who could not be present at a social. Condolences were sent to Pte Tralaggan’s family.

The Recent Floods.

The last week’s floods saw two narrow escapes from drowning. On Friday Harry Seeley was coming in from Austin’s Farm for supplies and was swept off the ford while trying to cross on foot. He was spotted by Stan Field who jumped in further down and pulled him to the bank.

On Saturday Mr H. Greatbatch, manager for T. Pearce, & Cr Fennessy were crossing the creek near McWaters’ at Leighton in a light dray when the horse was swept away and the dray and men with it for half a chain. Fennessy jumped out and swam to the bank, pulling the turnout with him. Greatbatch climbed along the shaft to safety, but the dray then overturned. The horse seemed to be dead and Fennessy cut the harness, but later the horse recovered. A bridge has been sought there for some time.

‘Fairplay’ writes on the same theme.

Ray Carter, Hon. Sec. Of the Black Springs Hall writes to say that Red Cross had enjoyed free use of the hall for about 10 months and he had offered to pay £2-2-0 towards the cost of the hall, leaving them to find just £1-3-0 for the use of it till 1 July 1917. As for the Red Cross ladies support of the hall before the war – they had supplied supper on two occasions in four years! He goes on to explain the situation further.

‘Johnny Trevaskis’ writes a letter in dialect agreeing that the recent appointment to the Hospital Board is wrong: ‘cause to maney relationes in a govment is as bad as to maney on a orspital Bord.’

He thanks Mr Crewes for his work towards the war effort and is sorry the north end of town is giving him trouble about letterboxes. He wonders why, now the new swing bridge is in place it isn’t finished off so it can be used.

[This is the first reference to this job for a long time.]

Council voted to erect temporary approaches to the new suspension bridge.

Council informed Mr Winnall it was prepared to grant right of way along the creek to Hon. J. Lewis on the conditions agreed to two years ago for 1/- p.a.

Casual hands were granted a pay rise to 9/- per day as from 3 July.

Council is concerned that the railway quarry bridge is holding water back and causing silting up of the channel. The bridge was too low and had been narrowed.

[Presumably this means that the width of the opening for the water had been narrowed.]

A conference on the matter was sought with the Railways Dept.

West Burra Copper Mine: Sixth half-yearly report to shareholders. G. Lord presided.

No large ore body has yet been found, but 81⁄2 tons of high-grade ore were raised and sent to Pt Adelaide. The financial position was not strong and there was a need to raise 10-20 tons. In the six months just gone a winze has been sunk from the 100’ to water level, c. 46’ at a cost of £92. A rise from the 50’ level to the surface cost £47 and 56’ of driving and crosscutting cost £79. The 81⁄2 tons despatched cost £61-7-0 to mine and forward, for a return of £200. Working costs have been £317. Presently the sinking has been 246’, driving and crosscutting 529’ and rising 47’. We believe further development is justified at the bottom of the winze. Funds can be obtained from work at the 50’ level. We began with a credit of £360-9-6 and end in credit £54-10-9.

S.M. Lane and C.B. Warnes were re-elected as directors. The directors were instructed to take out as much ore as possible in the light of the high price of copper.

Obituary. Jane Gibbons died 11 August at her daughter’s residence (Mrs M.A. Kellock) in Kooringa. She was the relict of the late Philip Gibbons and was aged 88. She came to SA in the Pestongie Bomajee on 12 October 1838. She lived for some years near Clarendon before coming with her husband to farm at Baldina just before the Mine closed. Mr Gibbons died in 1881 and Mrs Gibbons remained on the farm until a few years ago when she moved to live with her daughter. She had 10 children of whom 6 survive: Mr John Kemble (WA) [sic], Mrs William Kellock, Mrs M.A. Kelloch [sic], Mrs Fanny Kellock, Mrs Holman (Laura) & Mr H. Motherall (Hanson) [sic]. There are 51 grandchildren, 49 great grandchildren and 2 great great-grandchildren.

[Mr Kemble & Mr Motherall are accounted for because Mrs Gibbons was married three times: John Kemble in 1845, William Henry Motherall in 1863 (died 1875) and Philip Gibbins/Gibbons in 1878 (died 1881). Born Jane Waymouth 1828: died at Kooringa aged 87.]

Burra Hospital Board.

The Board told Matron to discharge a man admitted on a note from Mr Crewes, but without a doctor’s authority.

Water was penetrating one of the walls of the new ward.

Tenders will be called to remove part of the old building if the Chief Secretary permits.

Mr Dane reported on the state of the Hospital piano. It would cost £20 to repair and was not worth it. If they sold it for £10 he would run a couple of concerts and raise money for a decent one. His offer was refused with thanks.

Mr Hawkes moved that a suggestion be made to the Chief Secretary that he consult the Board before making appointments to vacancies thereon. Carried unanimously by the 8 present.

Fees were suggested by Mr Hawkes: Ward Patients £2 a week

Private Rooms £3-3-0 a week.

Mr Warnes brought up the idea of assessing patients’ ability to pay again. The others wanted to reduce charges when people couldn’t pay.

Mr Hawkes then suggested: Ward Patients 5/- a day, (£1-15-0 a week).

Private Rooms 10/- a day, (£3-10-0 a week).

Special nurses to be extra, but medicine & bandages included. Carried.

He leaves one child. He was employed by the British Imperial Oil Co. in Adelaide and enlisted in December 1914. He spent six months on Gallipoli before being taken ill and was six months in England on sick leave before going to France on 28 May 1916. [Born 8 April 1894 Kooringa.]

Burra Hospital Board, Monday.

Mr Crewes took up the case of the man admitted to hospital on his note and then turned out. He said the man was brought to him by Josiah Thomas and was spitting blood and looked seriously ill. He said Dr Ashton would not admit him to hospital because it was in a state of insolvency. After his discharge Mr Thomas took the man in and on Saturday night as much as a pint of blood and phlegm came away from his lungs.

Cr McBride said that at the Board meeting it was said the reason for not admitting him was that he was not ill enough.

Mr Crewes said he wanted to know if Dr Ashton had said the hospital was insolvent. If the Doctor said the man was not ill enough, that was a different matter.

Cr McBride said Dr Ashton did say so and refused to sign the admission form. Matron said there did not appear to be very much wrong with him.

Mr Crewes said this did not close the matter and he would take other steps.

Josiah Thomas writes outlining the case already put by Mr Crewes above, but going into more detail. He ends by saying he is sending the sick man, Briant, to Adelaide to see a doctor and hopes he will get better treatment there. He thanks the Mayor for his efforts.

The Red Cross Society expresses sympathy to Mrs Tennant on the death of her daughter and to the Davey family on the death of Pte H.E. Davey.

Burra Show Society met on Friday in the Liberal Union Rooms. For probably the first time a number of ladies attended. Mr Winnall moved to make the decision of the meeting binding on the General Committee with respect to the sales of intoxicants at the 1916 show. He linked a vote of no to the loyalty of the members. This produced uproar and cries of ‘Sit down’ and ‘Wowser’. He alleged that alcohol was as big an enemy to Britain as Germany, which provoked laughter. The vote in favour of a publican’s booth was 123 for and 54 against.

A Girls’ Patriotic Fair was held in the Institute on Friday under the auspices of the Salvation Army, assisted by representatives from other churches and over £46 was raised. The Mayor opened the fair in the absence of Mrs J.M. McBride, who was unable to attend because of Mr McBride’s ill health. Ensign Day had organised the event.

Burra Town Council.

The Deputy Postmaster General writes to Senator Foster saying the average number of letters posted between 10.15 p.m. and 9 a.m. was one and therefore keeping the mails open was not justified.

Cr Dane said this was a ridiculous reply. Of course people didn’t post letters then because they wouldn’t be cleared, but people going to Adelaide on the early train were rushed with requests to take letters with them.

The Mayor reports that the railways sent two officers to discuss the obstruction caused by the [Aberdeen Ballast Quarry] bridge, ‘the removing of fence road’ [?] and the building of a waiting room. They agreed that if levels taken showed that if the bed of the creek were made available for water for the full width it would be alright, then it would be done. At the fence they agreed to have rubble unloaded near the fence.

With respect to a waiting room money was short and they didn’t know where to build. However, a spot on the western side was found and the estimated cost was £200. They would do what they could and in the meantime would arrange for a fire in the refreshment room and for it to be made available to passengers.

Two framed photos of the presentation of the ambulances are to be obtained for the Council Chamber.

Burra Cheer-up Society.

On Wednesday 16 August there was a social to farewell Pte Norman Ford and Trooper Reuben McBride.

WCTU. An afternoon address by Mr Stanton, General Secretary of the SA Alliance, is reported in 1 column: The Hereditary Influence of Alcohol.

The Australia Day Committee met on Thursday and the treasurer said there was c. £1,139 in hand with about £59 outstanding, some large amounts having been forwarded directly to Adelaide, but to be credited to the Burra Committee. It was resolved to send £1,000 to the Central Committee.

Repatriation Fund. There was a meeting in the Council Chamber last Thursday to consider starting a movement to help along the Australian Soldiers’ Repatriation Fund.

Mr Crewes said the Federal and State Governments would start the fund off with £500,000. It would be entirely separate from the Wounded Soldiers’ Fund or any other and would be to enable returned soldiers to help themselves. They would be advanced loans without interest to help establish themselves in a farm or business, or acquiring tools of trade etc. He thought there should be country representatives on the Board to encourage country donations. A major effort is planned for the 27 October.

Mr Lane moved the establishment of a Repatriation Fund in Burra. Carried.

Mr Dane was elected Secretary and Mr Milner, Treasurer.

Booborowie School. A site has now been surveyed on the parklands for a new school.

Leighton had a farewell social on Monday last week for Pte Murray Pens.

XXXVIII, 35, 30 Aug. 1916, page 3

H. Jennison writes a letter from somewhere in France dated 26 June and describing the trip to France via the Suez Canal and a 63-hour train journey to the front. He goes on also with something of life at the front.

Leighton School Committee. Last Wednesday Mr I.J. Warnes, Chairman, presented pictures of Lord Kitchener, King George V and Queen Mary to the school. Mr Robinson, the head teacher, accepted the three pictures. Mr McLaren, representing the Burra School Committee, congratulated Mr Warnes on being appointed a JP.

‘Jimmy’ writes in Cornish dialect. He has a go at the situation of the Hospital Board and ‘poore ole Bryan’ and then turns to a reference concerning why the Council has warned people about the ford at Gully’s Wharf, which doesn’t seem to have been reported as news anywhere.

‘Ded i tel e aboute the Meyor getin stucke in that there crake, Counciller dane was with un. Law twas funy, the motter car got in the big ole, by Gullie’s warf. They ded un think their was one, but they foun un rite enuf.

Camps were held at Aberdeen Oval in November, at Princess Royal at New Year, with permission from Mr Tennant and at The Forest with the permission of Mr Cock.

Other activities are reported.

XXXVIII, 35, 30 Aug. 1916, page 4

‘One Interested’ writes strongly supporting the Black Springs secretary. Red Cross had free use of the hall for 10 months and then were offered effectively a year’s use for 101⁄2d a meeting. They should realise that the interest on the hall loan has to be paid, war or no war, and they have had a very fair go.

‘A Supporter of the Hall’ writes, putting a similar case very forcefully.

J.H. Dawe, of Mirra Mitta, Way Back, complains of the money paid to those who run the Bush Mails and the conditions imposed upon them. He says they should be allowed to charge more for passengers and large parcels.

‘Justice’ writes about importing goods from Germany and other enemy countries. With Germany subject to an effective blockade, taking goods from her and preventing her importing does more harm than prohibiting the importation of German goods.

A.E. Goodridge writes chiding ‘Wayback’ for supporting a pub at Booborowie.

James Reed of Wandillah writes thanking the Scouts for the ‘beautiful swastika medal presented to me at their first Annual Social held at Jubilee Hall on Thursday night in return for use of rooms at the White Hart.’

The Mayor pointed out he did not see why the troop should not have a room of their own. I think if an appeal were made there would be a ready response. I would be only too pleased to help such a move. Mr Reed enclosed £3-3-0 to help the work of the troop.

‘Householder’ writes agreeing with ‘Assistants’s’ [sic] letter about the Early Closing Act in a recent issue.

XXXVIII, 36, 6 Sep. 1916, page 2

Burra Town Council has agreed to sign a lease giving Bagot, Shakes & Lewis a 99-year unrestricted right of way to the Burra Creek for 1/- a year. The right of way will be free to all – the lease merely enforces the provision that the creek not be fenced to prevent stock movement.

The dog poisoner has been active again. W.J.C. Ewins has lost his well-known bulldog, ‘Buley’.

Golf. P. Roach won the tournament last Saturday.

Wattle Day last Saturday was not celebrated with any demonstration in Burra. Sprays of wattle were sold and raised £1-17-6 for a patriotic fund.

Wheat. Farmers meeting at Booborowie voted that they considered the time inopportune for the introduction of the bulk handling of wheat.

‘A Resident’ writes about the Black Springs Hall controversy, strongly in support of the secretary and deriding the writers ‘Anzac’, ‘Britisher’ and ‘Fairplay’ and wondering why the good ladies of the Red Cross, daughters and wives of Liberals, rushed off to a Labor supporter’s barn.

‘Fairplay’ of Mongolata writes believing all that Mr Thomas has to say of the Burra Hospital incident and expressing the hope that the Hospital Board will investigate thoroughly and complimenting Mr Crewes on his compassion.

‘Jimmy’ writes in Cornish dialect supporting Billy Hughes on the conscription issue, and supporting the Mayor’s latest vitriolic attack on shirkers and also supporting Christmas boxes for ‘our solgier buoys’.

‘Assistant’ writes about the Early Closing Act again, on the requirements to separate goods that are allowed to be sold from those not allowed.

XXXVIII, 36, 6 Sep. 1916, page 3

Soldiers’ aid Soc. A social by the Girls’ Club raised over £3 for tennis racquets for Auxiliary Hospitals. Produce and knitted goods continue to be donated. The fund stands at £354-19-2.

[Personal interest: Miss D. Fuss gave 2 pairs of knitted socks and Mrs C. Fuss 3 face washers.]

Christmas Boxes for Soldiers. Mr F. Harris has 250 boxes from the League of Loyal Women for packing. He will also pack for out-of-town-people if required. Matches must not be included. 20,000 are to be sent from SA. [On page 2 Mr Harris advised that filled boxes were required back for despatch by 13 September. The boxes themselves cost 7d.]

Burra Rifle Club. Best two shots on Saturday: P. Milner 105 and N.H. Pearse 104.

Burra Cheer-up Soc. On 30 August there was a welcome home social for Trooper August Brandt, who is recovering from wounds. Photos have been received of Ptes A. Isaac, H. Webster & V. Preiss.

Burra Town Council.

The Burra Burra Copper Co. writes claiming rent for the Council Rubbish Dump as it is not on the property recently purchased by A.J. McBride, but on that purchased by Mr Kellock.

[This does not make clear why then the rent goes to the company.]

The Railway Commissioner has decided that the traffic does not justify a waiting room.

Cr Radford moved that Gully’s Wharf [Ford] be attended to and done thoroughly. He was glad the Mayor and Cr Dane got stuck in it, but would have preferred it to have been Cr McWaters, who had opposed the work. (Laughter.) Carried.

Cr Radford moved that the Deputy Postmaster General be asked to buy the late residence of Mr Rabbich for use as a Post Office. Carried.

The Mayor thought the council employees should get an extra 1/- on account of the high cost of living.

Cr Killicoat said another aspect was that they could lose their employees to shearing, which needed men, or to the quarry, which could absorb 40-50 and their replacements might cost 12/6 a day instead of 9/-.

Cr Radford cautioned that it would add £45 a year to costs to increase wages.

Cr Lane and Cr McWaters moved that the wages for permanent hands be raised by 1/- a day. Carried.

Burra Scouts. PL Tom Luke has left the town with his family.

Mr & Mrs Keogh were given a farewell on Saturday. Mr McKeogh goes to Orroroo to take charge of the Pekena [sic] Irrigation Works. He has been in Burra for three years in the Hydraulic Dept. He received a solid leather brief bag and case of pipes and Mrs McKeogh an umbrella. She was also given a dressing case from the ladies of St Joseph’s Church Bazaar Committee on Saturday afternoon.

XXXVIII, 36, 6 Sep. 1916, page 4

Golf Club. The tournament last Saturday was won by Father Kett with two 57s and a handicap of 30.

Burra Cheer-up Society. On 5 September there was a farewell social for Ptes H. Killicoat, B. Dew [a.k.a. A. Dew] and R. Motherall. Photos of Cpl K. Drew, Pte H. Turner, Trooper J. Turner, Pte L. Harris & Pte H. Harris have been received.

Through the League of Loyal Women we are sending 200 Christmas puddings. 250 boxes, obtained through our society, have been packed with Christmas gifts for the troops.

Burra Show Soc. met last Friday. They resolved that the 1916 show be on Wednesday 25 October. Debentures of £195 have been taken up to cover the new luncheon room cost.

Details of rules etc. are reported in 2 columns. Section Fours were deleted ‘so that young fellows who would not enlist would at least not be allowed to play toy soldiers on the showground.’

W.H. Lloyd moved that ‘German cake’ be struck off the prize list. Carried unanimously.

The President, I.J. Warnes, asked permission to invite the Governor at his own [Warnes’] expense.

‘It was his last year of office and he desired to make it one upon which he could look back with pleasure.’

He was supported by Messrs Winnall, Harcus and Laidlaw and the move was carried by applause.

XXXVIII, 37, 13 Sep. 1916, page 3

Ptes A. Dew & R. Motherall were given a farewell social at Hanson on 4 September.

‘Equity’ writes drawing attention to a long and complex clause 64 of the Licensing Act of 1908 in which it would appear that any organisation ‘of which the members are or may be, of less than twenty-one years of age’ cannot be granted the form of liquor licence required for the show. The Show Society has such members.

‘Billy Shugg’ writes in Cornish dialect. He wonders why the paper reported not a word of the ‘grett hindiggnation meating’. [This appears to be the meeting referred to by ‘Jimmy’ where Mr Crewes berated non-volunteers and from comments it appears to have been on the subject of ‘Billy Ewes’ conscription referendum. Jimmy’s reference suggests the meeting was held on Friday 1 September, but I can see neither any advertisement announcing such a meeting nor any report of it other than the references in this pair of dialect pieces. Even ‘Billy Shugg’s’ complaint elicits no editorial explanation.]

‘Most Indignant’ writes to attack Fairplay’s attack on the Burra Hospital board.

Ray Carter, Secretary of the Black Springs Hall, writes spelling out with great clarity why charges for hall use need to be made and attacking the ‘anonymous’ Leighton writer whom he identifies as living at Black Springs when the hall was built, in the house ‘commonly known as a post office’ and saying he had ‘only about 250 yards to journey to get to the meeting’, but apparently decided not to attend because dances might be held there.

Obituary. L-Cpl Cliff. Oates was killed in action 20 July in France. He was the youngest son of Mrs M. Oates and the late P. Oates of Victoria Park Perth and late of Burra. He departed 18 November after being farewelled by Burra Cheer-up Society in the company of Sgt Luly. He spent some time at the defence of the Suez Canal. He had been employed by Dalgety’s & Co.

Burra Town Council.

Letter from Burra Burra Copper Co. asking whether the rubbish depot was on land owned by Mr McBride or that owned by Mr Kellock. They are to be informed it was on land owned by Mr McBride. [This seems a rather odd report since the last council report has a letter from the same company asserting it was on Mr Kellock’s land and yet asking for the rent to go to them.]

Mr Winnall presented the amended lease for the Burra Creek.

Local Board of Health.

The Health Officer reported an outbreak of measles with 9 cases so far.

A letter from Dr Williams condemns a cottage recently occupied by Mr O’Leary and owned by Mr R.M. McBride, as unfit for human habitation. Mr McBride says he has ordered Mr J. Pearce to put it in order for £150.

W. Howard Turner writes indicating he will reply to the Black Springs Hall Secretary when he has time. [Presumably he is the unnamed person formerly of Black Springs and now of Leighton who was referred to by Mr Carter.]

‘Fairplay’ writes attacking ‘Assistant’.

‘Father of a Light Horse’ writes condemning Mr Warnes for his remarks about the Light Horse competing in the show. ‘Fancy any man – quite fit to go to the war himself – mentioning toy soldiers.’

J.C. Killicoat writes from Cheltenham explaining that the term ‘Drill Order’ meant rifles, side arms, belts, bandoliers etc., which it is now unlawful to possess. He had advised the term ‘riders be in uniform’ would have been alright. He regrets that some members saw fit to cut the event out and hopes they will reconsider.

‘Jimmy’ writes in Cornish dialect, taking up the matter of the ‘indignasum maiten’.

‘Just fance peepul sayen our orspital was mismanaged an a disgrace, an onely fance cutradictan the doctors, aw, tes railey orfall.’

Thomas T. Shortridge confirms that his son has not been killed in action.

XXXVIII, 38, 20 Sep. 1916, page 3

Burra Hospital Board.

So far the doctors have not managed to keep a meeting with representatives of the Board.

There was a letter from J. Halls objecting to pay £13-10-0 for 17 days hospital attention. Though in isolation he could see no reason why a special nurse had been engaged from Adelaide. The ward was unfit for human habitation.

Mr Lane said as they had an agreement with the Local Board of health to treat infectious cases for 30/- a week, how could they charge more?

Mr Winnall moved the bill be reduced to £4-10-0. Carried.

Two other bills were reduced from 30/- a week to 25/- for enteric fever, as this was the ordinary ward charge.

The hospital had a shortage of patients – there were presently 9 – in the last two months the highest number any day had been 14 and the lowest 4.

Mr Winnall felt this had causes other than the level of health in the community and needed to be investigated, as a staff of 13 attending 7 to 8 patients was unsustainable.

Mr Gebhardt moved that the Chief Secretary be informed that under the circumstances the Board could not carry on the management.

Mr Winnall agreed that the Chief Secretary should, if necessary, appoint a new Board.

It has been stated that patients are being sent to private institutions.

Mr Crewes said it was a very serious thing to suggest closing the hospital.

A deputation will wait on the Chief Secretary.

Burra Cheer-up Society. On 13 September there was a farewell social for Gunner E. Wilks and on 18 September one for Pte C. Bruce. On the same occasion Trooper Gordon Hills was welcomed home.

The question of the condemning of the cottage next to Dr Ashton’s was discussed, but little real light was shed on it. Cr McBride said that at the time it was not let, nor was it being offered to let.

Court Unity AOF was visited by two District Officers on Tuesday evening last week and they were entertained at a social at the Institute. The lodge is 57 years old.

Burra Cheer-up Society. Photos have been received of Gunner Norman ford and Pte Lindsey Lafsky. Sgt Harold Hatherly arrived back in SA last Saturday and we sent him a welcoming telegram.

Burra Show Society General Committee met last Tuesday. The profit from the Sheep Show will probably be about £16. The rest of the 1-column report deals with details of preparations for the show. Following a letter from Lt Killicoat explaining the legal position about Section Fours they were reinstated.

Conscription Referendum. A meeting on 27 September in the Institute formed a committee to work for the carrying of the referendum in favour of conscription. Mr Crewes spoke strongly in favour, supported by Mr McLaren & Mr Winnall. Other participants were: T.H. Woollacott jnr, E.J. Harris, Mr Mundy, Cr Dane, Mr Mitchell, Mr Pledge & Mr G. Herbert. A special ladies meeting is planned.

Pte W.J. Herbert writes a letter dated 22 August from the 3rd General Hospital in England where he is recovering from a wound in the left arm close to the shoulder. He reports seeing Jack Steadman wounded in the knee and that Twist [Oliver] Ockenden is in the same ward as he is with a small piece of shrapnel through the knuckles of his right hand and one finger, but is getting on all right.

Soldiers’ Aid Society. The main effort of late was the provision of luncheon at the Sheep Show, which raised £25-18-5. The fund now stands at £386-16-10.

The Jubilee of Rechabitism in Burra was celebrated in the Cheer-up Rooms Tuesday of last week with c. 130 present. The 1st meeting 50 years ago was held in the old Baptist Chapel, now the Council Depot. Only two of the foundation members survive: Rev. J.A. Burns & Thomas Parks, both in failing health. The 1st secretary was the late David Wells, followed by David Anderson. C.J. Pearce has been secretary for the last 40 years. Membership is now 149. The strong female tent has 170 members and there is also a juvenile tent. The tent was financially strong.

Pte W. Pederson’s letter dated 16 August is printed. He wrote of the trenches, the deep fortified German trenches and of receiving a small wound in the leg.

[The conclusion of his letter is bitterly ironic, as he had since been reported missing: later confirmed as killed in action.]

‘When we go into the firing line there are three things that can happen to us; if we are lucky we get a trip to another world; others not quite as lucky get wounded and go to Blighty; and there are the unlucky ones, those that get through safely and have to go in again, so it is a bit of a speculation with us as to which of the three is going to happen.’

He was for a considerable time a Town Councillor and Member of the School Board of Advice. He was for many years the Burra Correspondent for the Register and was for a time on the staff of the Record. For much of his life he was a commission agent, but of late has been in charge of the Eastern Telephone Extension Exchange. He was aged 63 and leaves a wife and family of 12, including: Mrs A.

Obituary. Will Pederson was killed in action at Pozieres, France, on 21 August aged 29. He was the 2nd son of Martin Pederson. Letters to hand from other Burra boys confirm the death and Pte F. Wheatley returned Will’s diary. Pte Pederson was born in Burra 14 August 1887 and educated at Burra Public School. He later entered his father’s business. He enlisted in December 1915*[sic] and left for the front in April 1916 [sic], landing in Egypt in May. He went through the Gallipoli campaign and was among the first batch to land in France. He was very popular. Pte Hartley Harris writes to say that he was killed by a shell.

[*Actually December 1914, which is clearly also indicated by his presence in the Gallipoli campaign.]

[William Pederson born 14 August 1887 Kooringa: died 21 August 1916 Pozieres France.]

WCTU continues to hold monthly meeting at Redruth [in Jubilee Hall].

Hartley Harris & Bob Hawkes have returned to the front.

Burra Cheer-up Society held a welcome home social on 10 October for Sgt Hatherly, who has returned due to ill health. Photos have been received of Sgt L. Kellaway & Pte J. Kellaway. Sympathy is extended to the Pederson family on the death of Pte W. Pederson.

Burra Town Council, Monday. The Deputy Postmaster General wrote to say the revenue of the Aberdeen post office did not warrant the buying or leasing of a building at present.

Continuous telephone operation will be arranged as soon as possible.

Condolences were sent to the West, Hardy and Pederson families on their recent bereavements.

The Mayor indicated he was willing to stand again if that was what the people wanted, but was equally ready to stand aside if another candidate came forward.

Cr McBride did not feel inclined to fight an election, but would stay on if no one else came forward.

Cr McWaters said he felt until recently his health did not permit him to stand again, but it had improved and he would continue if no one else came forward, but would prefer some one else to take the position.

Local Board of Health.

There have been 9 cases of measles locally since the last meeting.

XXXVIII, 42, 18 Oct. 1916, page 3

Sapper Harry S. Blunt of Hanson writes of the exploits of his brother Keith, who was wounded while rescuing a runner and was unconscious in the field for two days before being found. He also refers to Clarrie Bishop’s death and to Hedley and Stan Bishop. [In all c. 2⁄3 column.]

Boy Scouts. The Scouts had a bicycle trip to Riverton, returning by rail.

Leighton School Children’s Concert last Saturday was in aid of school funds. The school has at present about 40 students and c. £4-10-0 was raised.

Burra Hospital. The Chief Secretary is to be advised they were not seeking to nominate members, merely that they might be consulted.

It has not at present proved possible to have a meeting with the Chief Secretary concerning the Doctors.

The meeting was adjourned for a week to devise a way of reducing staff as a consequence of the low usage of the hospital.

At least two probationer nurses desired to leave, as they could not receive their ATNA Certificate under present circumstances.

Black Springs Red Cross Society Report. The interesting sentence is that which reveals that the barn to which they had fled after the hall secretary asked for hall fees was that of Mr W. Turner ‘which has been generously lent for the purpose’.

[From the letter on page 4 W. Turner appears to be the father of W. Howard Turner of Leighton, who had featured in the correspondence.]

Soldiers’ Aid Society is working hard for the luncheon and afternoon tea at the show and Mr E. Cock has procured the cool drink stall for them too.

XXXVIII, 42, 18 Oct. 1916, page 4

The Black Springs Hall saga continues with a short letter from ‘Soldier’s Friend’ against the secretary’s stand and another very long letter from W. Howard Turner of Leighton, which is hardly surprising in view of the secretary’s last letter challenging Turner to join him at the front to establish the patriotic credentials of them both. 11⁄4 columns of print are expended in an effort to clarify the matter.

Cr S.M. Lane has volunteered for service abroad.

‘A Member of 11th Light Horse’ writes a letter dated 21 August recounting heroic stories of the Anzac Landing.

[This letter from an un-named soldier so long after the event and so very apt for the conscription debate and the referendum seems suspiciously like a plant. It reads like a patriotic speech from E.W. Crewes or one of his ilk, rather than a genuine letter from the front, but perhaps it is what it purports to be.]

Burra Cheer-up Society. Pte Voumard arrived home on Thursday evening, unwelcomed due to the very important meeting at the Institute. [The pro-conscription meeting.] We are sorry that he cannot see his way clear to attend a Cheer-up social. A photo of Trooper August Brandt has been received.

Ray Carter writes again inviting the Leighton correspondent to subscribe to the Black Springs Hall for 5/- a year and reporting that he obtained unanimous support at the Hall’s Committee meeting on 7 October.

Ray Carter writes in response to ‘Soldier’s Friend’. He comments on how willing people were to subscribe to sheep dog trials when Cpl George Powell was welcomed home and yet they are now saying we shouldn’t pay for the hall in wartime. ‘If the latest nom-de-plume has £90 to lend free of interest for a term, I will let the hall free of charge to all patriotic affairs for same term providing we can cry off with our present financier.’ The Red Cross ladies have been more helpful and it is only an outside party causing the trouble – and all over a 10d charge.

‘A Resident’ writes pointing out the financial folly of ‘Soldier’s Friend’. He is glad the Hall Committee have re-elected Mr Carter as Secretary.

XXXVIII, 43, 25 Oct. 1916, page 3

Conscription Referendum Campaign.

The addresses by the Rt Hon. Joseph Cooke and Senator Newland to the women are reported at length in over two columns. [But with no reference to Mrs Carew Reynell as advertised.] The evening addresses received another column and another 1⁄2 column reports a similar meeting at Booborowie. The meeting at Burra seems to have been for the proposal: ‘the speakers were listened to patiently and without interruption for nearly three hours.’

At Booborowie things were different in the woolshed. The seats provided were not all filled and there was amply standing room. There was organised opposition and Mr Hague MP was shouted down. M-C Kane ejected four or five and Mr Hague then proceeded amongst countless interruptions and boos. Senator Newland gave as good as he got and received a somewhat better hearing. Two or three eggs were thrown, but to no real effect. Mr McDonald had three of his car tyres slashed with a pen-knife. Rocks and eggs were hurled at the cars of the speakers as they later left the homestead and a gun was fired into the air.

A meeting at Mt Bryan was similar to the Burra meeting.

XXXVIII, 43, 25 Oct. 1916, page 4

Letters from Officers re the death of Pte C. Bishop are dated 18 & 26 August. They also report that Hedley Bishop is missing. A card from Major General Sir H.V. Cox KCMC [check KCMG?] CB CST congratulated Pte C. Bishop on his great bravery between 12 & 14 August 1916.

It includes a history of the Bible Christian Church in Burra and illustrations of the original Bible Christian Church and manse and also the newer one now in ruins as well as pictures of a number of the ministers well known here, like Rev. James Way and Rev. Joseph Hancock. There is reference too to the great revival when 400 attended weeknight services and 390 converts, including 70 juveniles, were made. Sunday school under Thomas Richard contained over 500 scholars. The church cost £2,217 and seated 600. Proceeds of the sales will aid Adelaide Central Mission and Dr Torr’s Training Home at Brighton.

The Conscription Referendum.

In the Kooringa Division of Wakefield (Stretching from Mt Bryan to Farrell’s Flat)

Burra Show, Wednesday 25 October.

[The introduction to the report cites 1897 as the date of the 1st show, but it was actually 12 September 1877 and they were held annually to 1885 and then not til 1894.]

The weather was perfect and taking were a record £99-6-9, up from £96-12-6 the previous year. With more than double the number of members the crowd was conservatively said to number 2,000. Livestock entries were good. Dairy produce was good in butter, eggs, ham and bacon. Poultry was magnificent with 256 entries. Draft horses were very good, but bloodstock was poor with only three entries in four classes. The ring show was excellent. (Ladies now-a-days ride astride.) The Gawler team won the Section Fours. The 29 entries for cattle were a record. The dog show was good as were vegetables and flowers with over 105 entries – if not quite as good as last year. The President, I.J. Warnes, entertained for lunch the Patron of the Society, Hon. J. Lewis MLC, the President of the Clare Society and the Secretary of the Petersburg Society.

XXXVIII, 44, 1 Nov. 1916, page 3

Burra Cheer-up Society received a cheque for £74 from Elder, Smith & Co. Ltd, being half the proceeds of the sale of a ram presented by the Canowie Pastoral co. Ltd and sold on the Bugler system. A photo of Trooper Dixon Thompson has been received.

‘T.R.W.’ writes castigating Ray Carter and saying Carter made a condition of his gift of £2-2-0 to the Red Cross that the ladies should ‘stop all outside talk’.

Ray Carter writes re-affirming that ‘the father offered a free barn’.

W. Howard Turner offers a further 3⁄4 column resenting the personal turn taken by Ray Carter’s letters, but it adds little to what has gone before and Turner has been just as personal as Carter.

‘One Interested’ seems to attack both sides in the Black Springs Hall matter and suggests that both writers are ‘sturdy young men’ who would be more useful at the front.

Soldiers’ Aid Society was busy on Show Day. The fund stands at £389-10-3.

Whooping cough and measles kept attendances low between July and October. Mr Biddle, Headmaster of the High School said in January there were 38 pupils and 4 had since obtained positions while 4 had left the district and one girl was engaged in domestic duties to leave 29. This was the greatest number in November since the High School was founded in 1913. Attendance was not as regular as was desirable.

Farrell’s Flat Horse Show on 1 November is reported. Some 800 people attended.

Burra Cheer-up Society held a welcome social on 1 November for Sgt C. Bennetts and Pte C. Brown was welcomed home wounded. Photos have been received of Gunner Wilks, Pte L. Jesser and Capt. A. Lott.

W. Howard Turner offers a brief letter on the usual topic and also offered a lengthy one that the editor decided not to print.

He stayed briefly in Adelaide before going to Mt Gambier where he was employed by Charles Aubrey, general storekeeper. After about 31⁄2 years he came to Burra where he worked for several years for Young & Drew before buying the ironmongery business of T. Builder, which he conducted till about two years ago. He was active in civic and church life and was a prime mover in the establishment of the Burra Institute* and was a committee member until recently. He was Town Councillor for 2 years, [Dec. 1899-Nov. 1901] Treasurer and a trustee of the Forester’s Lodge and a trustee of the Kooringa Methodist Church and a Sunday school teacher. On 5 September 1879 he married Miss Catherine Watson, daughter of the late Thomas Watson of Nottingham. He is survived by a widow and 2 daughters: Mrs James Peak and Miss G. Williams.

[* Since he was in England when it was established this presumably refers to the rebuilding of the Institute in 1874.]

Weather. Last Friday there was a severe storm after 5.20. A huge clap of thunder was followed by hail and rain and 35 points fell in 5 minutes. Market Square was flooded. Lightning struck a chimney on Norman Pearce’s in Thames St, but no serious damage was done anywhere in town.

At Mackerode Mr A.G. Gebhardt just managed to get Mrs Sangster Senior, who was visiting, inside before she was blown over. A chimney came down, a tree fell across the verandah and iron flew off sheds in all directions: ‘about 200 out of 400 large trees were torn up or twisted and broken. He reckons his loss in five minutes at c. £1,000. A heavy trolly was blown over and a cultivator moved 150 yards. All shed, stables and outhouses were unroofed and some of the iron travelled 3⁄4 mile. Water in a dam was lifted into the air about 50 feet and the level in the dam dropped two feet. Several windmills were destroyed and telegraph poles on the main road were bent, some westerly, and others easterly. Elsewhere the effects were felt, but less drastically.

[This was clearly a tornado.]

To the east Sturt Vale got 1.4”, Old Koomooloo 0.76”, Caroona 0.49” and Mongolata 0.3”.

Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting, Burra Institute, Monday 27 November.

About 50 attended with Mr Winnall in the chair.

The Mayor’s report was read and adopted.

The Mayor said he had neglected to mention the removal of the railway fence and the straightening of the road near the Bon Accord Hotel. He said he had done his best and thrown his weight behind the patriotic efforts. The Council had worked as a happy family with some differences of opinion, but no bickering. The town was badly lighted, but it could not be improved without raising the rate. Dead Man’s Bridge was an eyesore and a danger and he would like to see the road straightened.

When the candidates were invited to speak J.E. Greenwood said nothing about policies. J.E. Harris thought that decreasing the general rate and increasing the lighting rate might have advantages. Dead Man’s Bridge needed something done and the Pig & Whistle crossing needed a bridge.

All Councillors and candidates favoured doing something at the Pig & Whistle.

There was also an idea of doing something at Gully’s Wharf, but the north end and south end Councillors had different views on that. Cr McWaters would oppose any bridge there and Mr Greenwood agreed with him.

Mr J.E. Pearce expressed dissatisfaction with the amount of tar paving in the main street in Kooringa.

Cr Radford thought that North Ward deserved more than its four lamps – they contributed one third of the rates.

Things were admittedly limited at present, as carbide had doubled in price.

Soldiers’ Aid Society sent £20 last week to a large military hospital in England (with 1,600 beds) where many Australians were being treated. The total fund was now £522-9-11.

XXXVIII, 48, 29 Nov. 1916, page 4

The Mayor’s Report for 1916.

Last season the harvest was very good. The Government commandeered the whole crop and at present farmers received 2/113⁄4 per bushel, but perhaps more may come due to the high prices prevailing in home markets. A good harvest this year also seems assured. The pastoral industry has also been prosperous with feed abundant and wool prices good.

The war continues, but the tide seems to have turned. The effort to support the war has continued very successfully here.

Red Cross

The Button Day and Fair raised £200. Since the branch started 14 cases of goods, each worth over £20 have been sent away and over £550 in cash in addition to donations to other causes, such as £55 to the Ambulance Fund.

Band of the 43rd Battalion

£112 was collected at two open-air concerts to aid trench comforts for soldiers.

Australia Day Celebrations

Held last July by the various patriotic societies, these celebrations raised almost £1,400.

Ambulance Day

The enthusiasm for this cause saw four ambulances handed over to the military authorities. One came from J.M. McBride, one from A.J. & P. McBride and two from money raised locally. The handover took place in September in front of the South African War Memorial in Adelaide, the Governor making the presentation on our behalf.

Anzac Anniversary

On 25 April a memorial service was held in the Institute.

YMCA

In September a visit from representatives of the YMCA sought funds for the Lady Galway Club House at Henley Beach. £150 was raised.

United Memorial and Intercession Service

On 27 August at the Institute the first united service in memory of the fallen and of intercession for those still fighting was held at the Institute.

Australian Soldiers’ Repatriation Fund

The first meeting to collect funds for soldiers on their return was held in August. Action was deferred pending the outcome of the referendum.

The All British League

This branch was formed last April and membership is 70 and growing.

Burra Cheer-up Society

This continues to meet weekly and makes useful articles for the boys at the front. A social farewell is tendered every lad on leaving and a presentation of a parcel of serviceable articles is made. A welcome home is accorded every returned soldier. Last year when celebrating Violet Day Burra Cheer-up Society raised £414 and a bunch of violets sold on the bugler system realised £384. This year the special effort on 7 July raised £232-2-0. Since starting nearly £2,000 in cash has been raised.

Soldiers’ Aid Society

This does similar work to the Cheer-up Society and has collected over £580.

The Boys Scouts

Under Mr Rigney they are making great progress and now number 42.

The War Effort

The district has raised and sent away c. £21,000 and nearly 400 have volunteered.

The Supreme Sacrifice has now been made by:

John Camp B.W. Pearce P.D. Killicoat

Stan Pearce J. Duell W. Pederson

H.E. Davey W.L. James R. Woollacott

H. Skinner H. Trevillyan J. Honan

J. Sommerville C. Kuchenmeister B. Collins

B. Jones F. Trallagan C. Bishop

And reported missing or prisoner:

A. Bruce T.W. Dixon L. Fuss

O. Niemann

[Of these, A. Bruce & L. Fuss were POWs while T.W. Dixon was killed 16 Aug. 1916 & O. Niemann was killed 23 July 1916.]

Burra Coronation Band

During the year most members of the band enlisted and it became impossible to carry on. The young ladies of the Cheer-up Society under the leadership of Mr James Bentley have formed a band to do their work. Funds to enable them to do so are solicited.

Fire Brigade

The town at last has a fire-reel, hydrant and hose and a fire bell has been placed in the police yard. A volunteer fire brigade has been formed with W. Truscott as Captain. So far only one use has been made of the service.

[Details of income and expenditure then follow.]

Rates per ward:

North £146-12-3

East £167-12-0

West £154-16-6

Rates assessed £974- 3-6

Rates collected £937-14-4

Arrears £36- 9-2

Parklands

Dead trees were removed and new ones planted. Of the new trees, mainly pines, many have died and others have been wantonly destroyed.

The new garden in Ludgvan St has improved that part of town and a plot reclaimed and fenced near the Mine Bridge will soon be planted.

The account started in debit £47-17-4 and ended in debit £22-4-1.

Cemetery

Mr H. Wilson is curator. The account started in credit £89-9-4 and ended in credit £141-7-4, but impending repairs to the cemetery walls will reduce that considerably.

Main Roads

The grant this year was cut from £430 to £377, but money in the special grant account will allow repairs to the ford at the old White Hart Hotel.

Tar paving both of roads and footpaths continued and will go on next year.

Bridges

The application for funds to replace three bridges washed away by flood last year resulted in funds for only one bridge. The one previously near Lord’s Hotel has been replaced with one opposite the Institute at £210. The Government paid half and the Council will pay the other half over five years at 5% interest. The Government has promised to assist later with the bridges near the White Hart Hotel and the Pig & Whistle.

Local Board of Health

The move to appoint Mr George Lawn scavenger with the Council’s own horse and dray has been very successful. It has proved economical with the dray used elsewhere when not required for scavenging.

Electric Lighting

There have been several approaches about electric lighting, but while the war continues and money markets are difficult we decided to defer any decision. At present there are 20 acetylene lamps in town and the cost of maintaining them amounts to £5-5-0 per lamp and the rates do not allow more lamps without increasing the rate.

Generally the town has made progress with many new and substantial houses erected and roads improved. The telephone system has been greatly extended. With peace we can expect much more progress.

Theatregraph Pictures will soon show in Burra war films featuring The Big Push or The Battle of the Somme. Lloyd George says: ‘If the exhibition of these films does not stop the war, god help civilisation.’ These are the first official films to be taken under fire.

The writer says: ‘The film does not lacerate the feelings. On the contrary, it uplifts, it searches the soul.’

Clarice Eva Clark was charged in Adelaide with the theft of two gold necklets from Mrs A.G. Gebhardt. She had previously been employed at ‘Mackerode’. She had not tried to sell the property. She was bound over on a surety of £10 to keep the peace for 12 months.

Burra Town Council.

Letter from English & Australian Copper Co. saying it intended to dispose of its property in January and asking if the Council wished to purchase any of it. The area included the Smelts. A road starts at Victoria Park and ends at the Company’s property. Councillors considered that the road should go right through. Cr Radford believed the road had been surveyed through.

An arrangement had been made in a similar case at Penfold St [sic], but was not shown on the survey map. A sketch plan of the land to be sold is to be asked for.

[There is no Penfold St, but perhaps Penglawdd St is intended.]

The Railway Commissioner appealed against the assessment of railway cottages. A decision is pending in the Supreme Court.

The White Hart Hotel ford is to be paved.

T. Highett is appointed lamplighter at Kooringa at 1/- per week per lamp for 15 lamps.

J.B. Griffiths applied for the north end of town at 12/- per week for 5 lamps, an increase of 2/- a week. Accepted.

G.A. Ridgway writes attacking Cr McWaters for his gratuitous insults on the women of the North Ward at the ratepayers’ meeting. A bridge at the White Hart would serve a racecourse, showgrounds, sale yards and a quarry and in wet weather the way around involves a steep climb to use the Redruth Bridge. Any argument that it is not required is equally applicable to the bridge just built in Kooringa.

‘Consistency’ writes complaining of infringement of the Early Closing Act – perhaps at Aberdeen, as that was his address.

The Boy Scouts thank Mr Morton for the gift of a small generator for gas lights.

St Mary’s Annual Strawberry Fete was successful despite heavy rain. About 170 lb of fruit was sold at the strawberries and cream stall. £118 was taken.

Repairs to the cemetery wall are progressing well.

Cr Harris asked if it was Council’s intention to have a roll of honour.

The Mayor said a motion to that effect had been passed.

The idea most suitable was similar to Mt Bryan’s Roll. The cost was about £20 for the 1st 50 names.

Given the large number two rolls might be needed.

He estimated the cost at £100 to £150.

Cr Dane had seen a diagram for 400 names at £60-£80.

The Mayor counselled delay at this time.

Cr Harris feared the records of some men might be lost.

The location suggested was the Hall or the Public Reading Room.

The proprietor of the Record offered to publish all names available with a view to obtaining others not on the list.

Red Cross Christmas Tree was held last Friday at the Institute. Mr & Mrs Cock brought in the tree from the forest. As well as Father Christmas there were various stalls. Nett proceeds were £86-9-4.

The Mt Bryan Roll of Honour was unveiled in the District Hall on Sunday last before a capacity crowd. The roll is in copper bronze mounted on oak with each name inscribed on a brass plate. It cost over £20. The committee chairman, Mr Rush, spoke. Mr Crewes represented Burra and other speakers were Rev. H.A. Miller, Mr Winnall, R.C. Winfield (for Salvation Army) & W.J. Wilson.

A collection was taken and I.J. Warnes promised to give 1/- for 1/- up to £25. The collection reached £10 and John Collins made it up to £25 so that the total will reach £50. The balance over the cost of the roll will go to the local Red Cross sewing circle. Mr Warnes then spoke and took away the Union Jack covering the names.

Characteristics of the paper in 1916.

Page 1.

Large advertisements usually fill the page, but from early in the year some news items etc. also appear. The advertisements are mostly local.

Page 2.

Dominated by smaller advertisements, public notices, notices of sales and the like. Editorial comment is rare. News begins and there are usually between two and three columns of it.

Page 3.

A couple of large advertisements and then the rest is news. The news was dominated by war issues, especially the activities of local patriotic societies.

Page 4.

Smaller advertisements compete with a widely fluctuating amount of other material which varies generally from 2 to 4 columns, but sometimes vanishes.

Due to the war the quality of the paper is not very good, but the general newsprint is better that that used for the literary supplements, which are worse and by now are very brittle.

Coverage of local news seems to be quite detailed and the editorial position is very strongly behind the patriotic efforts as might be expected. This was also very evident when the matter of the conscription referendum was being debated. The paper strongly urged a YES vote.

Numbering of issues in 1916

The practice of beginning a new volume each year failed.

The year began with Volume XXII Number 1980 on 5 January 1916.

But the very next issue saw a change to Volume XXXIII Number 1981 12 January 1916.

This continued to Volume XXXIII Number 1997 3 May 1916.

For no apparent reason there was then a change to:

Volume XXXVIII Number 19 10 May 1916

And continued to Volume XXXVIII Number 51 on 20 December 1916.

Literary Supplements 19161

1 Only a few of the supplement for 1916 are preserved and most of those only in the hard copy.

2 The dates for these supplements are unclear because the bound hard copies and the microfilm disagree. The problem stems from the first of those above which is dated 29 December 1915, but no paper was issued on that date. It is omitted from the microfilm, but bound with 5 January issue in hard copy.

Leighton Public School Prize Day is reported from 21 December. The head teacher, Mr H.O.J. Robinson, parents & friends assembled on 23 August to see the unveiling of three portraits and two flags. (HM the King, HM the Queen & Lord Kitchener and the Union Flag and the Australian Flag.) They had been presented by I.J. Warnes. At present there were 36 on the roll with an average attendance for 1916 of 27, which is good considering that 70% of the children travel over three miles.

Burra Institute, Annual Meeting.

The credit balance was over £200. In the year Commercial Classes have been run.

For two years ending in December 1916 the committee has given £44-8-6 worth of hall use to patriotic efforts.

The Library now has 4,658 books. 12 scholarship subscriptions have been again given for 1917. Mainly due to Orchestral Classes becoming members the membership has increased.

In December 1915 single members 99 and double 25 for total of 124

In December 1916 single members 148 and double 25 for total of 173

Orchestral and Choral Classes were limited by the war, especially the Choral Class, due to enlistments.

Burra Roll of Honour.

A first draft of the roll is printed and additions and corrections are requested.

West Burra Copper Mine. 7th Half-Yearly Meeting.

Work has been continuous and while not particularly profitable the returns have been sufficient to keep the men fully employed. We began the period with £54-10-9 and ore sales brought in £386-15-4. Expenses were £309-3-3, leaving a balance of £132-2-10.

Prospects remain encouraging. Stoping work has been done at the 50, 100 & 146’ levels with most ore coming from the 50’ level. We believe the main body of ore is below the water table and the mine merits much further development.

Obituary. The death of ‘Raspootin’ has been confirmed.

Burra Cheer-up Ladies’ band & AIF Boys Concert.

As the boys enlisted the Burra Coronation Brass Band numbers fell and at the end only a couple were left and it had to be disbanded. The Cheer-up Girls decided to take its place. Appeals were made for donations and for instruments. When news reached the Exhibition Camp in Adelaide a concert party was organised. The Burra Cheer-up Society had done so much to help the boys and this was a chance to repay something. Lt W.A. Read OC gave permission for a visit to Burra for a concert. The aid of Miss Hilda Felstead and Miss Kitty Sullivan was enlisted. The concert on Monday was packed. The Ladies’ band led off with Templesmore and given the short time for practice the result was impressive. It was a pleasure to listen to and earned the storm of applause it got. The rest of the concert was very good and was rapturously received, especially Miss Kitty Sullivan’s burlesque of The Melodrama and Miss Felstead’s comic songs. The sum raised for the band was £33 including a £5 donation from Mr T.H. Pearse. [Details of the review run to almost 1 column.]

Burra Identities.

Mr Richard Reed

Mr Reed was 80 on 22 January and is the person longest resident in the town*. He was born in Cornwall in 1837 and came to Adelaide aged 10 with his parents. They settled first at Kapunda where Mr Reed’s father was a miner. 12 months later they moved on to Burra. Richard was engaged here in whim driving and other tasks and after a few years turned to plastering. When gold was discovered in Victoria he made three trips to the gold fields in 1853-54. He then returned to Burra and purchased a team of bullocks and engaged in wood carting and carting other requirements of the mine. The men working on top were on tribute, but underground workers had wages. The hours underground were 7 to 3. Aborigines were common in those days and corroborees were a common sight. There were magnificent gum trees on either side of the Burra Creek. Eventually Mr Reed turned to sheep farming and took up the property of ‘Wandillah’. Money then could only be got at 10% and wool prices were low. The droughts of 1863 and 1865 were disastrous and he lost practically everything. Mr Reed retired to Aberdeen about 14 years ago. In 1859 he married Miss Ann Henwood, daughter of Mr John Henwood of Burra and has three sons and three daughters: Richard Reed (Aberdeen), John Reed (Mongolata), James Reed (‘Wandillah’), Mrs George Sara, Mrs C.H. Bartholomaeus (Aberdeen) and Miss Reed who lives with her father. Mrs Reed died about four years ago. He has never taken an active part in public life. He celebrated his 80th birthday by ‘doing’ the Murray trip with Miss Reed.

* While this may have been true, statements of this sort are not to be relied upon.

Mr Sampson Montgomery.

He resides with his son-in-law and daughter, Mr & Mrs Henry Tralaggan of Aberdeen. He celebrated his 98th birthday on Thursday. He is active and has never consulted a doctor. He spends much of his time in the garden and is a great smoker. He was born in Cornwall in 1819. His father was in the British Army in the artillery and fought against Napoleon. He came to SA as an employee of Mr George Fife Angas and is believed to be the last survivor of those who came out on the same boat, the Henry Porch [check this], arriving 1 July 1838. He became a gardener for a Mrs August in the vicinity of Walkerville before becoming an engineman and fireman for Mr John Dunn. Mr Montgomery took up land at Dry Creek and after five years moved to the Upper Wakefield District where he stayed until retiring about 25 years ago. He has lived with Mr & Mrs Tralaggan for 24 years. In 1849 he married Mrs Harding, a widow whose husband had drowned in the River Torrens. She died several years ago. The family are: Robert Montgomery (Jamestown), John Montgomery (Brookton WA), James Montgomery (Aberdeen), Thomas Montgomery (Quorn), Mrs H. Tralaggan (Aberdeen), Mrs James McGowan (Aberdeen) and Mrs W. Dunstan (Broken Hill).

Mrs Simpson attained her 93rd year on 31 January. Her first visit to the town was before the mine started. The township of today was then about three houses and one hotel, ‘The Pig & Whistle’. She was born in Forben, England in 1824. He father, Mr Samuel Hawkes being engaged in farming. Her mother died when she was 10. In 1844 she married Mr Richard Simpson, a shepherd. They lived in a hut a good distance from the head station on Booborowie Run, having been engaged by Dr William Browne whilst coming out on the Schacamchen in early 1851. They travelled from Adelaide by bullock wagon, passing only about three houses on the way. Mr Browne once told her husband to engage anyone who came along, but he replied he had not seen anyone looking for work for the previous three years. Aborigines were common and at first very wild, but later became more friendly. Her first visit to Burra was made on foot – about 18 miles from Booborowie. After about 20 years the family took up land at Mintaro, but after 12 months returned to Booborowie and then after a while took land at Mt Bryan. After a hard battle they retired due to Mr Simpson’s ill health and settled in Burra, but her husband died after a short time, in 1889. She recalls the dugouts in Burra Creek, some of which were very comfortable and roomy. In early days Mrs Simpson was an active worker in the Primitive Methodist Church. Until the last year she has been very active and managed her own business affairs in connection with property she owns in the town. She has two sons and a daughter: John Simpson (Belalie North), Richard Simpson (Burra) and Mrs J. Robinson who lives with her mother.

Obituary. Mr D. [David] Radford died at his residence ‘Condellara’ in Aberdeen last Thursday [15 February] aged 80. He was born 4 April 1836 at Exeter, Devonshire. The following year his parents migrated to Australia with their family of six sons and three daughters in the Prestonjee Homanjee [Pestonjee Bomajee] with Lt-Col. George Gawler on board. They arrived at Holdfast Bay 12 October 1838. After four years in Adelaide they went first to Encounter Bay and then to Greenock where they raised sheep. This was successful at first, but later failed due to scab in the sheep. In 1852 Mr Radford and some of his brothers went to the Victorian gold fields. They were successful and returned to SA briefly before a second visit. The second time they returned to SA by means of a boat they built at Swan Hill. A few years later Mr Radford prospected with others for gold in New Zealand, but this was unsuccessful and the party suffered privations. In 1872 he was part of a party led by John Ford to the Northern Territory for the Yam Creek Gold Mining Co. The Hon. John Lewis was also a member. Several members lost their lives in the wreck of the Gothenburg, including Mr Thomas Radford. Mr Radford then turned his attention to farming at Clare and Angaston in partnership with some of his brothers. In 1879 he took up land near Gordon for sheep farming and later continued in this line to the east of Burra, remaining there till retiring to Burra. In 1861 he married Martha Smith, daughter of the late Samuel Smith of Angaston, but she died soon, leaving one son and he remarried in 1865, Jane Roberts of Angaston, daughter of the late George Roberts. He took no part in public life, through a hearing affliction, but he took an interest in the Redruth Methodist Church. He leaves a widow, five sons and a daughter: S.O. Radford (Durban, South Africa), D.H. Radford (Burra), M.A. Radford (Burra), F.W. Radford (Burra), G.L. Radford (Sydney) and Mrs John Bowman (Leighton). Also 13 grandchildren. He was the last of his generation to die.

Redruth Court, Saturday 24 February.

Arnold John Collins was charged with secreting 61 letters. This was withdrawn on a technicality and was replaced with the charge of wilfully detaining an article sent by post, to wit a letter addressed to Mrs W.A. Gebhardt.

A.A. Dale postal assistant had discovered the offence when he went to Collin’s room on 16 February acting on information – they both live in the same boarding house.

Henry John Rutter, acting postmaster, gave evidence of receiving 17 letters from Dale and marking them and then going to the room and finding 44 further letters. The postmarks on the letters were from 20 January to 5 February.

The Seaside Trip to Glenelg was held last Saturday. The morning was cold in Burra and also in Glenelg. The lack of platforms at Glenelg was somewhat inconvenient, but the railways provided stepladders. Many people went to Adelaide instead of the beach, but others went to the amusements like the merry-go-round, the big wheel, swinging boats and the shooting gallery.

The start from Burra was marred by a crush on the platform and hoodlum-like behaviour by some young men who pushed through regardless of comfort and safety. There were 1,000 people to accommodate and the use of different coloured tickets for the two trains would have helped. The failure of the railways to provide sufficiently powerful engines for the return journey meant the run home was two hours late. The first train arrived at 1.40 a.m. and the second at 2 a.m. But overall, except for the road accident at the start and the late arrival and the slow journey home, most people had a good day’s outing.

Recruiting Meeting, last Wednesday.

Mr Anstey said 95% of our boys will come back and promised preferential treatment for them from a grateful nation. There was a scheme to train returned soldiers for farming. A training farm had been set up at Pompoota and one at Mt Remarkable. Reclaimed land along the Murray would be made available – a house, dairy cattle, pigs and poultry supplied to the value of £500 on a loan with no interest in the 1st year and then 21⁄2% in the second year, 31⁄2% in the third and 41⁄2% in the fourth and then at the current rate. The Repatriation Fund would pay any deficiency in earning and £25 free paid for furniture. The Mt Remarkable training was for mixed farming. Other options were aid in setting up a business and pig and poultry farms at Seaton were another option.

W. Hutley gave a short address. If he could get 30 young men they could stay together as a Burra contingent.

Motor Accident.

On Saturday morning c. 4.30 a.m. Streicher Bros.’ small charabanc was going to the station with passengers with Mr P. Pederson in a Buick just behind. Mr Wicklein in his ford approached from the other direction. Apparently confused by lights and dust Mr Wicklein drove onto the wrong side of the road. Mr Streicher pulled almost onto the footpath and stopped, but the Ford struck the charabanc amidships and turned it over. All escaped unhurt except for Mrs Ambrose Harris who sustained a fractured collarbone. Even she was able to continue her journey and is now progressing well. Mr Pederson only avoided running into the scene by going up a steep bank onto the footpath at the risk of overturning his own vehicle. Prompt action by both drivers averted a potentially serious accident.

‘Horatio Copperhouse’ writes that on the day of the seaside trip he and others decided to picnic at the Recreation Ground, but on arrival found the four iron gates all locked and the sole occupant of the grounds to be ‘the Municipal Horse [which] was fast asleep’.

‘One gentleman who was present recklessly leaned against the gate and the chain, which was about the same age as the horse, gave way at its weakest link and lo, the way was open before us.’

‘We entered the forbidden ground, careful not to disturb the poor old horse, which, considering the present exorbitant price of meat must have been worth at least 3s 9d.’

He considered arrangements for access could be made on future such occasions.

Marriage. Miss Winifred Dew, 2nd daughter of Mr & Mrs Fred Dew of ‘Blue Bells’ was married to Mr H.A. (Art.) Przibilla, 5th son of the late Andrew & Mrs Przibilla, late of Farrell’s Flat, at ‘Blue Bells’ recently. After the honeymoon in Broken Hill the couple will live at ‘Beltimore’, Tothill’s Belt.

The Recruiting Meeting, Wednesday. A further report with in excess of 2 columns of detail.

[The incentives now being offered surely indicate that getting volunteers was growing more difficult.]

‘If two or three friends enlisted and desired to remain together they would be guaranteed one tent and would not be parted.’ If a lad a distance out desired to enlist they would go and get him and fill out papers, arrange the medical and pay him 10/- for the day. He could also have six months leave without pay, which would count as active service. Volunteers could choose which section of the army they entered. For the Commonwealth the requirements were for 3,375 a week and enlistments were 1,368. Men from WA and Victoria had to make up for the SA quota.

Speakers were Lt Robinson, recruiting officer for the Wakefield District, Hon. E. Lucas, Mr Anstey and Mr W. Hutley.

Burra Town Council.

James Pryor sought a pay rise of 7/6 a week to 22/6 for lighting lamps in Kooringa and the right to the proceeds from the sale of carbide holders and a pair of leather gloves.

Cr Harris moved it be granted.

Cr McBride said the carbide lamps were useless and it was time kerosene was substituted. It cost more than the rates brought in ‘to light lamps which were never alight’.

Cr McWaters agreed – some of the lamps had not been alight for weeks.

The matter will be considered.

[The outcome of Cr Harris’s motion is unclear.]

The Main Roads grant is for £400.

It was proposed to tar dress from the post office to Drew & Crewes’ corner and from Dalgety’s corner to across the Black Bridge.

Cr McBride objected – it was nonsense to put tar on a flat road that would not carry it. He wanted the tar dressing postponed till they saw how it was done in the city.

Cr Harris moved that roads already tar dressed be redressed at once. Carried.

Soldiers’ Aid Society is currently responding to a great demand for socks and has just bought £40 worth of wool to be made up. The fund now stands at £586-7-2.

Notice. Burra Recruiting Committee calls a meeting in Council Chamber on Thursday to make arrangements for a demonstration early in April to be called ‘Win the War Day.’

Obituary. T.A. Gregg died 2 March. He was born in London in 1862 and came to SA in the SS John Elder in 1882. He knocked about various stations for some time and then joined the Railway Dept. at Quorn c. 1885 and stayed with them for 27 years. For 20 years he was a driver, mainly on the Adelaide-Morgan and Adelaide-Terowie lines. He left the Railways in 1912 and took the Bon Accord Hotel. He leaves a wife and one daughter.

Redruth Court, Wednesday.

J. Lauritsen of Booborowie was charged with making unlawful threats to an elector, L.L. Larwood, schoolteacher of Booborowie to influence his vote in the Referendum of 28 October. The accused and another threatened to dip him in a trough unless he voted NO. Mr Bright got a dismissal for the defendant and £2-2-0 costs for want of proof that (a) Larwood was an elector and (b) a referendum was taken on 28 October. [In both cases typical legalistic nonsense.]

Repatriation Day, 9 March.

The aim was the raise funds so that when the boys came home again there would be money to help them return to civilian life and establish homes, businesses etc. Platforms and booths were erected in Market Square on Thursday night. Allied flags and bunting decorated the place. The sweets and cool drinks booth was run by the Cheer-up Society. There was a huge marquee for luncheons and afternoon tea and large boards to record the votes of the ‘popularity’ competition. There was also a baby competition. A procession was organised by Mr Hann from the Railway Station to Market Square led by M-Cs McCarthy and Kane followed by Jack Hann under a huge cat’s mask. Then came the Burra Cheer-up Ladies’ band comprising: Trix Pearce, Nelly Pearce, Annie Pearce, Hilda Hunt, Edie Harris, Dulcie McWaters, Lily Riggs, Doreen Pressick, Myrtle Isaacs, Lydia Burns, Ethel James, Olive Hopgood, Gladys Lawn. They were followed by two decorated perambulators and the Soldiers’ Aid Society with a beautiful display on Robertson’s motor trolly. Young ladies in white bearing red, white and blue umbrellas were followed by a couple of Red Indians before Britannia in a Golden Chariot, built by August Fuss and drawn by a crowd of little girls. Military Cadets under Lt Phillis were followed by the Adelaide Locomotive Band, which in turn was followed by the Boy Scouts under Scoutmaster Rigney and Lt Robinson and the Recruiting Staff. Next were a quaint lot of little nigger boys in a ramshackle cart and a group in giants’ masks. Following them was Mr [Jack] Allen as John Bull and Mr Hawkes’ decorated car labelled ‘Back to the Land’, which was decorated with primary produce, but framed as a boat. W.H. Sandland’s car was fitted up as an aeroplane and was followed by other cars and traps.

At Market Square speeches were made by Rev. S.J. Bloyd, Mr Winnall, Mr Hawkes, Recruiting Sergeant Stacey and the Mayor.

A Union Jack sold under the Bugler system finally went to H.H. Thomas for 50 guineas, but raised in all £260-12-0.

[Personal interest: Edna Maud Allen raised 17/21⁄2, Dorothy Eileen Allen £3-12-61⁄2 and Ruby Myrtle Bernhardt 16/5.]

A Band Concert in the evening was packed out. The ladies Cheer-up Band played with the Locomotive Band for the overture.

The Mayor estimated the takings for the day would gross c. £2,000. In fact so far the gross takings have come in at £1,999-0-9.

Burra Cheer-up Society. The sweets and cool drinks booth raised £31. A photo of Pte O. Duldig has been received. Correction: last week’s parcel did not go to Pte C. Sangster, but to Gunner Frank Sangster.

Burra Show Society. A special general meeting last Friday changed the rule forbidding the President to serve for more than two years consecutively. The argument was that originally nominations were openly done at a meeting and voting was public, but now nominations are sought ahead of time and voting, if needed, is by secret ballot. Mr Winnall outlined the reasons for desiring a change and Mr McWaters moved the motion, which was 2nd by Mr R.M. McBride. Mr Hawkes supported the change, as did Mr J.

Burra Town Council.

In reply to a question of Cr McBride’s on notice, the Town Clerk said the cost of tar-paving roads was:

£69-18-1 for 21 chains [c. 1⁄4 mile or 422 metres.]

£60-14-3

To metal a road cost £10-15-1 a chain [or £225-16-9 for 21 chains], which without tar lasted about 3 years.

Cr McBride said this cost only represented repairing and the original cost of tar was c. £8 per chain. There were 61⁄2 miles of main road in Burra and a grant of £400, which represented c. 15/- a chain, so it would not be possible to keep other roads in repair if £3 per chain went in tar dressing.

Someone needs to be sent to Adelaide to see how it is done properly.

Mr McBride and Mr Crewes than had an altercation over whether a Mr Brown had or had not told the Mayor that the Burra tarred roads were a credit to the town. The Mayor said the road from Dalgety’s to the bridge was perfect for tarring and should be done. Cr McBride disagreed.

The motion to tar the road was lost.

Monday.

Cr McBride said the present street lamps were very unsatisfactory. Of the twenty, half were never lit. There were ten days a month they were not lit at all, so effectively they were paying the lamplighter 9/- a day to light 20 lamps.

The Mayor said the present generators were unsatisfactory. To go back to kerosene would be to go back 50 years and in any case lamp glasses had risen in price by 300% and the result would be even worse than the acetylene.

Cr Harris said he had been talking to the lamplighter and all but three lamps were going all right.

The Mayor said there were two or three lamps belonging to the old Band that might be used. The Town Clerk reminded them that they were German and parts were hard to get.

Particulars of the most recent streetlamps are to be obtained.

Cr McWaters moved that the request of the lamplighter for more pay be refused. Carried.

Captain Truscott of the Fire Brigade said that at present the reel was a fowl roost and was rusting and unless some arrangements were made he would refuse to take any further part in the brigade.

Council will inspect the situation.

Burra Show Society. AGM last Friday.

President I.J. Warnes’ report.

The war has continued for the whole year and many of our members have been at the front. We extend sympathy to those parents whose sons have been killed or who are ill or wounded.

The season has again been splendid, with local wheat yields at 18-19 bushels per acre – the best ever. Some paddocks reached 40 bushels per acre. The season was late. The Imperial Government bought the whole crop at 4/9 bushel. The year was poorer for wool with almost no rain till July and therefore poor lambing, but wool prices were high.

Membership has grown by 111 to 275.

A large majority of members voted to retain the publican’s booth for this year.

A luncheon room has been erected and a ticket office jointly with the Racing Club.

This year there was no Government subsidy.

Sheep Dog Trials were held and . . . [The rest of the paragraph was not printed.]

A separate Sheep Show was held in September and was a success.

The annual show was on 27 October and was an unqualified success. For the first time the cattle yards were well filled.

Visit of the Premier and Senator Senior.

At the Burra Institute last Thursday evening there was a small attendance to hear the speakers explain the object of the National Party. [Actually it was the Nationalist Party.] This was the union of the Liberal and Labour Party on the one platform. The Premier, the Hon. Crawford Vaughan, spoke. The election had been brought about by the actions of certain senators. He made scarcely veiled suggestions impugning the loyalty of his opposition.

[This election followed the split in the Labor Party between Billy Hughes and his followers and the anti-conscription part of the party.]

The Premier’s speech is reported in 12⁄3 columns and Senator Storey’s comes in the next issue.

Burra Town Council, Monday.

Bagot, Shakes & Lewis have presented an account for 5/- per load of crusted slag taken without permission.

Mr Crewes wanted the matter referred to the solicitor, as he believed the Council could take any road material on payment of a royalty.

Cr Dane said it would amount to c. £3 and moved it be paid.

Cr McWaters 2nd, saying it had been wrong to take it without permission.

Cr Radford moved a letter be written stating the Council thought there would be no objection to taking the slag, that the price was unreasonable and should be reduced.

The Mayor said the tar was hot when the suggestion was made to try the slag. He was not aware it was on Bagot, Shakes & Lewis’s land.

Cr Harris thought it was on the English & Australian Copper Co.’s land.

Cr Killicoat said the firm was simply making a point. The men had made a mistake and took from the wrong end of the heap. The opposite end would have been on English & Australian Copper Co.’s land for which permission had been granted.

The motion was altered to pay for four loads at the rate quoted with a quotation sought for quantity. Carried.

Cr McBride said if the heap was worth 5/- a load it was worth the assessor’s attention!

J.S. Pryor forwarded his resignation as lamplighter for Kooringa unless the pay was increased to 1/6 a lamp per week. The contract for lamp lighting was cancelled and new applications will be sought for Kooringa and Aberdeen.

Ed. Bowen’s quote to paint the Mortuary Chapel was accepted at £10-5-0.

Cr Dane said the continuous telephone service was failing at times when the exchange could not be raised. The postmaster’s attention will be drawn to it.

Obituary. Mrs Thursa Finch died suddenly 15 April after collapsing suddenly at breakfast with heart failure. She was born in Devonshire on 10 March 1833 and married 15 April 1857 to Mr William Finch. In about 1870 Mr Finch came to Australia to try his luck and Mrs Finch followed in 1872 in the City of Adelaide. Her two sons, William and George, came with her. In England Mr Finch was in the trawling business. In Australia he worked for his father who had migrated a few years earlier. After several years they took land at World’s End until retiring to Burra. Mr Finch died about 6 years ago. Sunday was the 60th anniversary of her wedding.

Frank K. Nieass writes explaining that Mr J.H. Sinclair’s interpretation of the advertisement about the recent Labor Party Meeting was ‘hairsplitting’ and arrangements not to interfere with the Patriotic Films had been made by the ULP speakers and that was all the advertisement referred to.

Norman Makin, ULP candidate writes taking up a question asked at the recent meeting concerning the high cost of shipbuilding in Australia. He basically says the costs of setting up an industry cannot be legitimately all applied to the first item produced.

Federal Election Meeting, Monday evening, Burra Institute.

The nationalist Candidate, Hon. R.W. Foster and Senator Newland spoke.

Mr Foster’s speech was strong on patriotism and on the evils of the anarchic socialism of the IWW, which had captured the Labor Party. He also attacked the Senate as undermining the war effort and preventing Australia from sending delegates to the Imperial Conference. Australia is not doing enough for the war effort.

Win the War League.

Under the auspices of the Red Cross there were addresses on Wednesday afternoon by Dr Gertrude Halley of the Public Schools Service and Mrs Christophers, Secretary of the Women’s State Recruiting Council. Their object was the formation of a branch of the Win the War League in Burra. It was now up to the women to get the remaining men to enlist. Those who answered a call of duty or were attracted by military pageantry etc., or who had nothing else to do had already gone. Women needed to point out that the % of men killed was very small and most of the wounded recovered. Australia was prosperous and personal needs in Australia showed little self-denial. Children should give up their sweets and buy war stamps. Interview the womenfolk of eligible men. Women could take on men’s jobs.

Mrs Harcus moved a branch be formed in Burra and Mrs W. McBride 2nd. Mrs Amy Harris was elected secretary. The election of a President was held over, as Mr Crewes was absent on electioneering business.

Burra Town Council.

J.E.H. Winnall writes that an anonymous donor has offered a roll of honour for those who have fallen and may yet fall in the war. Accepted with thanks.

Mr Thamm appeared protesting that his residence in Young St had been assessed at £20. It had cost £235 and a neighbour’s 5-roomed house was assessed at £8.

Cr Killicoat: ‘Why, isn’t it true that the pro-Germans got all they wanted at the last election.’

Mr Thamm: ‘I don’t want to be called a pro-German.’

After some discussion Cr Killicoat moved to reduce the assessment to £17-10-0, as they had reduced Mr Kellock’s from £26 to £20.

Mr Thamm thanked the council for its ‘careful consideration of the matter and the magnificent result achieved.’ [Mr Thamm’s letter in the next issue, page 3, confirms that the tone here was sarcastic.]

The Mayor reported on the deputation to the Commissioner of Railways re a Saturday night train. The deputation represented towns from Gawler to Petersburg. The response was an unpromising one: to consider the matter.

In the matter of private post boxes at Aberdeen it seems the only way they will be obtained is if the local postmaster buys them and has the revenue from them.

This was left in the hands of North Ward Councillors.

Cr Killicoat declined to accept the responsibility.

A letter of Sympathy was sent to Mr Carey on the loss of a son on active service.

There have been no applications for the lamplighter’s position. Mr Pryor indicated he would take it on at 30/- a week if Council would undertake to give him a few days other work per month when available. Accepted.

## N. Hiles Pearse has received an interesting souvenir from his brother, Driver H.L. Pearse in England: a brooch in the shape of a boomerang made from aluminium from a zeppelin brought down in England in 1916.

Redruth Methodist Church, Sunday evening last. It was noted, not for the first time, that a man of German descent in business in Aberdeen, was not singing the National Anthem. A father of a boy killed in action signalled him to do so and he refused. He was then knocked lengthwise into the aisle and forcibly ejected from the church. He has since written an apology and promised to sing it in future at church. [The man was E.E. Thamm.]

[This version of events is challenged by E.E. Thamm in the paper of 13 June, page 3.]

At the Kooringa Church a similar offender being in receipt of a Government pension was threatened with its loss unless he sang the National Anthem. Now he sings louder than the loudest and, of course, means it.

Springbank Estate has been bought by the Government from W.H. Stevenson to be subdivided for closer settlement. It comprises 4,652 acres of 1st class agricultural land. It came on the market because Mr Stevenson’s two sons have enlisted. In the last nine years, which included the 1914 drought, he has averaged over 20 bushels per acre. Two bores produce a splendid supply of water.

Dr Caw writes from HMAS Australia to Mrs Harcus.

Insect Powder. Annie Wilson of Hindmarsh Red Cross seeks donations to send insect powder to the trenches. They are the only branch getting it mixed and they pack it and send it themselves.

E.E. Thamm writes in rather a bitter humour commenting on his treatment when he appealed his assessment. Cr McWaters reinstated the original £20 after a small reduction [to £17-10-0] had been moved by Cr McBride. He invited Cr Dane to visit and see for himself the value of the property. He offers to provide a plank 16’ x 12” x 11⁄2” to convey Cr Dane from his car across the slush to the verandah steps!

Mr Warnes and Mr Hawkes were also on the Royal [Show] Society in Adelaide and had there supported an Adelaide Show, but Mr Warnes also supported a Burra Show. The smaller breeders would miss out if only an Adelaide Show were held. Mr E.W. Hawker, Mr W.S. Murray, Mr T. Sandland, Mr W. Duncan & Mr R. Hawker spoke in favour of a local show. Mr M.

Violet Day was held on 7 July and was very successful even if not as big an effort as last year. Christmas cheer was again collected and sent off through the League of Loyal Women. 400 Christmas puddings were despatched and cigarettes for 400 men in the navy. Well-packed Christmas boxes were sent to 50 nurses in Egypt. Mr F. Harris got 250 Christmas boxes from the League of Loyal Women and these were speedily bought and packed by people. Parcels were sent to two prisoners of war, but we don’t know if they arrived. In January we appealed for khaki handkerchiefs and 2,250 were handed in.

The Burra Cheer-up Ladies’ Band was formed to replace the Burra Coronation Band that disappeared with the enlistment of most of its members. The first practice was on 9 November under Mr Jim. Bentley. The Burra Town Council donated the Coronation Band instruments, but most had to be replaced. The band first appeared in public on 19 February 1917 and has appeared on a number of occasions since, including the opening of the Girls’ Reformatory lawn a few weeks ago. The band now has 7 new cornets, 4 new tenor horns, 2 new baritones and I new euphonium with 12 new music stands and 4 acetylene gas lamps.

History of the Burra Burra Mine by James Thomas Snr No. 1

Initially problems were not great, but as the workings deepened water became a difficulty and four water whims were kept running day and night to keep the water level down and this led to the ordering of an engine. 40 bullocks dragged the parts of it to the mine. The engine house was built to suit the engine, but it was unfortunately sited. In the first three years they produced 10,000 tons of copper and realised £700,000 and it was equally productive in the next three years to 1851. The first setback was the loss of men to the Victorian goldfields and the works ceased and the engine fell idle, allowing the mine to be flooded.

When they came to restart the pump the building was found to be crushing the shaft out of the perpendicular and twisting it. The house cracked and another shaft and engine were needed. Even then they positioned its replacement on similarly honeycombed ground and this No. 2 engine (Schneider’s) began to show similar signs of collapse. The third attempt was Morphett’s on solid ground. Developmental work was not carried out and any signs of it were stopped by the directors on visits. The proper management of the mine was hampered by these men, who knew nothing of mining or its requirements.

Burra Cheer-up Society farewelled Sister L. McWaters and Pte W. Nankivell on 4 June. Sister Armstrong could not attend.

A farewell social for Pte D. Eig was held on 11 June.

Photos have been received of Drivers T. Carpenter & J. Carpenter, Gunner McCarthy, Ptes D. Eig, J. O’Brien & C. Jones. A parcel was sent to Sgt Marrion.

E.E. Thamm writes concerning the disgraceful scene recently in the Redruth Church.

He denies he was signalled by Mr Tiver to sing, neither was he knocked into the aisle, nor was he forcibly expelled from the church. He admitted to bowing while the National Anthem was sung. He was pushed ‘a little off his equilibrium’ and then joined in the last bar of the anthem. He was leaving with his wife when someone unknown to him suggested he leave – probably fearing an altercation with Brother Tiver.

[Mr Thamm does not actually say why he was not singing the National Anthem in the first place, but does say there was no harm in holding his tongue while an appeal was made to God on behalf of the King, implying less than fulsome agreement with the sentiments expressed. He seems also to agree with the sentiments of one observer that singing the words really signifies little unless you mean them. The letter is interesting because of the marked German accent that comes through in the writing.]

Mr & Mrs Harcus were given a farewell social at the Institute on Wednesday evening last. They had been in Burra for about 12 years.

Rev. S.J. Bloyd spoke for the Church of England.

J.E.H. Winnall for the Hospital Board.

Mr McLaren for the Institute, of which Mr Harcus had been Vice-President.

Mr W.G. Hawkes had driven 500 miles to be present.

Mr Treloar spoke for the Show Society.

Mr Pederson endorsed the above.

Mr Crewes (Mayor) spoke of the work of Mr Harcus and Mrs Harcus in patriotic activities and then presented Mr Harcus with a gold watch and Mrs Harcus with a purse of sovereigns.

He then welcomed Mr & Mrs Ruthven who replace them at the Bank of Australasia.

Mr Harcus responded.

Pte R. Burns then arrived from the front to the National Anthem and God Bless Our Men played by the Cheer-up Band, which continued with patriotic airs.

The paper then publishes, at the request of C.G. Tiver, a letter from E.E. Thamm JP to J.E.H. Winnall dated 11 June in which he denies that he had charged Mr Tiver with using bad language in church and adding that nothing would have been heard from him (Thamm) had not ‘a stupid and untruthful report appeared in the press’.

A second letter dated 18 May is also published.

[This date is puzzling because the original press report appeared on 30 May and refers to an incident that occurred ‘last Sunday’, which would thus have been 27 May and even if it had been a week earlier it would have occurred on 20 May.]

In this letter E.E. Thamm accepts an apology from C. Tiver for an incident in church. He says he has talked with Rev. Bridgwood over the matter. He has never thought lightly when the National Anthem was being sung and was deeply moved for the boys at the front, having close relations in the fighting line. He says that on reflection he will sing the National Anthem in the future and expresses sympathy for one who has lost a son in the conflict.

C. Tiver writes that on receiving the above he would have let the matter drop, but for Mr Thamm’s outburst following the paper report [on 30 May] where Mr Thamm says Tiver’s language ‘might have caused the King to blush’, which surely is an accusation of the use of bad language and a reference to ‘whitewash’ and ‘bulged eyes’ – but he assumes Thamm’s supply of ink will eventually run out as Thamm uses it ‘not only on me, but on several other well respected men of our town’.

[This is presumably a reference to Thamm’s recent altercations with Council members, but there may have been other unpublished matters as well.]

Burra Rifle Club. At the match on 16 June the best shots were O.G. Walker 101 and J.E. Pearce & A.B. Riggs both on 99.

Trooper N. Ford writes from France saying he was injured in a railway accident in which six men died and eleven were injured.

History of the Burra Burra Mine by James Thomas Snr, No. 2

With Morphett’s engine set up it could scarcely keep pace with the water. Another engine was needed. An excavation in solid ground was needed. The engine house was erected, but the engine was never installed. The shaft to raise the water was excavated and said to have cost £160 per fathom. Why work stopped when it did was never revealed, just when they could have been made useful. Some said the company was chicken-hearted. They closed the mine and left it idle for a quarter of a century with a caretaker in charge. Many expected it to start again with higher copper prices because well-defined fissure lodes had been encountered at the bottom levels, suggesting to mining men proof of its permanency as a mine. Its closure seemed cruel to shareholders, miners and tradespeople in Kooringa and Redruth and it was also a shock to the Patent Copper Co. [Actually to the English & Australian Copper Co.] In full working order the mine employed 1,110 hands. The surface men earned 21/- a week with 1/- withheld for the doctor and club. The lived in the creek bank, which was then 10-12’ deeper than today from Aberdeen to the cemetery. The prices of necessities were about as they were before the war except meat which was 1-11⁄2 lb. The miners supposedly got 30/- a week, but were generally paid by results, so much a fathom for tutwork, or on tribute at a % of value of ore raised. If they cut a rich lode they could be very well paid. There was nothing in the way of labour troubles so water was the only real difficulty. The water could easily have been kept down had they kept Roach’s engine and used it with Morphett’s – but they sold it to Karkulta Mine. They succumbed to a phase of hydrophobia.

Nurse McWaters was farewelled at Leighton on Thursday 7th instant.

YMCA Army Dept. Burra Branch was formed on 14 June at a meeting in the Council Chamber where Capt. Shoebridge explained the work of the Department and sought to stimulate interest in the formation of a local branch committee. The YMCA provided secretaries and equipment on each troop ship and provided stationery etc. at the front and elsewhere. They organised trips and entertainment at places en route like Colombo and sold items to the boys to add to their comfort, which had cut the cost to the men by 50%. A committee was formed comprising: E.W. Crewes, P. Milner, G. Lawn, J. Drew, N.G. Burns, F. Harris, G. Horner, Rev. A.J. Finch, Mr James, G. Dane, H.H. Thomas and E.J. Harris.

History of the Burra Burra Mine by James Thomas Snr, No. 3.

The copper deposits at Burra were different from elsewhere in that down to 40 fathoms the ore was a jumble of patches of rich copper ore in irregular and often unexpected places. It was easily worked with little blasting required, but the miners all expected ‘she would make down’.

The Bon Accord Mine was sunk to 50 fathoms where they cut a proper fissure lode. John Nickles of Copperhouse worked on it and it embraced the width of the engine shaft and its depth and direction suggested it was a continuation of the Burra lode.

As for Princess Royal, Mr John Nickle and F. Harris, father of the esteemed present townsman, worked there too. They found good malachite a few feet down. In all probability there is a connection between the two mines, but companies would have to be prepared to go deeper than the Burra Co. that only scratched the surface. I lived on the Burra Mine in the 40s and early 50s and as a whim boy hauled hundreds of tons of rich ore from every level and nearly every shaft. Mt father was the timberman who inspected the mine daily to see timber was secure. Much rich ore was washed into the Burra Creek in periodic summer thunderstorms and no doubt lies buried under silt brought down from the Mt Bryan watershed. The bed of the creek now being some ten feet higher than originally.

Burra Cheer-up Society.

Burra Cheer-up Ladies’ Band was invited to Adelaide to play at Violet Day there and arouse public interest. The Military Band greeted them at the station and they proceeded to the Cheer-up Hut where they were welcomed by the Naval Band. After a cup of tea the Ladies’ Band then marched along Adelaide streets led by the Bandmaster of the Locomotive Band, (which had also lent the use of its drums). On entering King William Street the girls played Templemore. They turned into Rundle St where they attracted large crowds before taking Gawler Place to Grenfell St and thence via King William St to the GPO where they paused for another selection. They then returned to North Terrace for the Memorial Service where the Military Band played the Recessional and a bugler played Last Post with all traffic halted. The Ladies’ Band then played the National Anthem. The Governor and Lady Galway congratulated the girls on their achievement and they were asked to appear for the Wondergraph operator for moving pictures.

The President of the Cheer-up Society entertained them for lunch where speeches from those assembled praised Mr Bentley’s and their achievements and that of Burra and District in patriotic causes. In the afternoon they again marched through the streets followed by half a dozen Light Horsemen leading a horse with an empty saddle. The crowd was enthusiastic. In the evening they appeared at the concert at the Exhibition Building where their first item was The Trail that Leads Home, followed by Little Lad in Khaki – the latter to great applause.

Burra Town Council.

The mayor reported on the visit of the Ladies’ Band to Adelaide and its great success. Sir Henry and Lady Galway had had their photo taken with the band and he thought the Council should obtain a copy for its chamber. The Councillors agreed to subscribe for it.

Violet Day in Burra. The gross takings were £356. It was celebrated last Friday in very adverse weather. The rotunda was decorated in memory of the fallen with a wreath for each of the fallen and also Ptes Lindsay Stephens and Reg. Johnson who enlisted elsewhere.

Just as preparations were complete steady rain set in for the rest of the day and evening. Despite this the Ladies’ Band marched up Commercial St and played a number of selections. John Drew gave a moving address followed by Mr Winnall and the Mayor. Lt Donaghue appealed for recruits. A bunch of violets sold on the Bugler system raised £185. Postcards of the Ladies’ Band and Sir Henry & Lady Galway sold well (18 dozen).

The ceremony at the rotunda had to be abandoned on account of the wind and rain and the speakers stood in the rain so the public listening could shelter under the Market Square verandahs. Despite this the response was good. The produce market had to be moved into Henderson’s Buildings (courtesy of Harris Scarfe & Co.) and thanks went to the many shops that dressed their windows in purple and white in memory of the fallen.

Burra Sporting & Athletic Club – Local Wounded Soldiers’ Fund.

At the meeting on Friday in John Allen’s office the President, J. Gallagher, reminded them that the fund was intended to offer immediate help to local returned wounded men. The intention was to make a donation without asking what the recipient was going to do with it. The Burra boys were by no means all in the same position. Some parents were living on their son’s military pay, while others were banking it for their son.

The executives would try to allot gifts according to the club’s funds and the individual’s needs, but all would get some sort of gift regardless of their financial position. Mr E. Weymouth who had two sons at the front spoke in support of Mr Gallagher. Donations will be sought widely from the community. Funds in hand were £61-5-4 plus some collected in the past week, making £79-16-1 in all. It was decided to present Messrs R. Ockenden, Syd Williams and Cardigan Jones with a wallet at a social evening on 18 July at the Oddfellows Hall, Aberdeen.

Burra Hospital Board, meeting last Thursday.

[It is clear from the report that there had been certain unspecified difficulties between Dr Ashton and the hospital staff.]

Mr Winnall reported that the Secretary had written to Dr Ashton asking him to put in writing his general instructions to staff. Mr Winnall referred to a number of other incidents as well. Dr Ashton had not responded and Mr Warnes then moved to terminate Dr Ashton’s appointment as a medical officer of the hospital at 31 July 1917.

Mr Crewes sought to have Dr Ashton given the opportunity to carry out the instructions before further action was taken, but the motion passed.

Pte F. Gebhardt writes from France of better conditions and of the front having advanced c. 10 miles and of the surrender of numbers of dispirited Germans.

Pte Norman Ford writes from France of a visit to the Battalion where his brother was serving before he was taken prisoner and of heavy fighting. He makes reference to various other Burra boys.

History of the Burra Burra Mine, by James Thomas Snr, No. 4.

Was it a golden time and a time to accumulate wealth?

Surface workers got £1 and underground workers £1-10-0 a week, but wet weather could reduce the pay. There was no rent to pay on dugouts. These were dark and not well ventilated and their position made the getting of the necessities of life to them strenuous. Fuel and water etc. had to come down rough steps. Butchers, bakers and grocers shouted down chimneys to summon women up to be served. Finding a place for a woodheap, clothesline, water barrel and other outside matters called for ingenuity. The view from the door was creek bed and distant hills. Sunday was a bright spot in the week. Furniture was little and crude and home made and light came from a slush lamp or tallow candle. Camp ovens were a necessity. Many kept the Sabbath, but others desecrated it. One set regularly went out kangarooing, but more often returned with a bandicoot or wildcat. There were many colours and nationalities, including a few Negroes. Some fancied cockfighting or dog fighting. Mr Paxton built four hotels and a square of houses: i.e. the Burra Hotel (now the hospital), Lord’s Hotel [then the Miners’ Arms], the Pig & Whistle in Kooringa and in Aberdeen there was a little hotel called the Southampton Arms, which had to be strangled to give him a monopoly, so he built Opie’s Hotel on the north boundary of the mine, ‘just across the chain road from the Southampton Arms’. Soon the peace-loving, law-abiding community was converted ‘to a drunken, wife-beating rabble’. The first publican I remember was Mr Wren of the Burra Hotel and Messrs Cowper kept the other two. The shops were then:

General Stores: Boord Bros.

Thomas & Kekwick

Marks & Gollin

Thomas Bath

Samuel Drew

Warren Bros.

Doctor Moore

Chemist: Mr Greenwood

Saddle & Harness P. Lane

Henry Dawson

The SM was Mr Lange

History of the Burra Burra Mine by James Thomas Snr, No. 5.

The Strike of Miners & Labourers in 1847.

They wanted higher wages, were refused, and struck. A few continued working and were then rounded up by the strikers, wheeled about in barrows and branded as blacklegs. But they lacked unity or organisation and slowly drifted back to work and the only outcome was a handful of ringleaders got the sack.

The gold rush to California saw a few depart. In Burra nothing in the way of schools had been attempted except for an old lady or two with an infant school in a private room. From the age of 8 or 9 boys were employed horse driving or picking over the ore.

Black Thursday.

The Blacks had set fire to the grass in many places to secure new shoots for emus and kangaroos, when the wind from the north blew a hurricane and this added to a normal ‘brickfielder’. The air was full of ash, grit and dust. The temperature I should judge was about 140°F [At 60°C probably an exaggeration!] with a wind at 90-100 m.p.h. blowing gravel as large as peas as well as dust and sand. It was hard to breathe. I was 13. The day was dark and candles had to be lit indoors and even then a tallow candle only appeared as a blue speck on the table. The fires had depleted the oxygen and increased the carbonic acid gas in the atmosphere. Many thought it the end of the world; others sought refuge in the hotels and drink. The creek was even then silting up and observant people saw the dangers of flooding and the wise were building houses. A flood followed Black Thursday.

History of the Burra Burra Mine, by James Thomas Snr, No. 6.

The heavy rain took some time to send the floodwaters as far as Burra. They arrived in the early morning and the evacuation of property began. As it was summer it was not cold, but the piles of furniture etc. by the flour barrel chimneys were pitiable enough. The men went to arrange shelter and every available building was soon occupied – churches, schoolrooms, engine houses and sheds of all sorts. Nearly all of the huts caved in.

Soon after news of the Victorian gold discoveries arrived. People sold everything they could to finance a trip to the gold fields. Many went by ship, but some walked. Within a month virtually every able-bodied man had gone. They aimed to get enough to return, but when they got £200 or £300 most could not resist a rest, which generally meant a spree. A few did manage to retire, but most returned after four months or so and returned with money to squander. Some repeated the journey and the folly several times. But by the second or third time their ground had been taken by others and the alluvial gold was mostly gone and capital was needed for mining the reefs. All in all a few did well and saved their money, many did well and spent it and a few did not return.

Burra Show Society.

The Sports Syndicate has offered a 21-year lease for £3-3-0 per annum. Mr Winnall thought they should have it on easier terms considering the amount of money they had spent on the luncheon booth. The President also thought it high as they had spent £250 in the last two years and £200 before that. The President suggested asking for a reduction to £1-1-0. Mr Winnall thought it didn’t really matter much as the Syndicate spent the money on improvements. The lease was accepted.

The President of the Burra Poultry & Kennel Club waited on them with requests about the prize list for the Burra Show.

The President said poultry was already well treated with about £23 in prizes and anyway it was too late to make alterations for this year.

Mr Winnall said the aim was to encourage the breeding of use rather than fancy breeds. No action.

History of the Burra Burra Mine, by James Thomas Snr, No. 7.

In the early years of the colony the Sa Colonization Assoc. got a grant of the colony to sell at not less than 12/- per acre with the revenue so obtained going to an emigration fund. Control of the company’s affairs vested in a body of commissioners and a Governor nominated by the Crown. In 1838 Governor Hindmarsh was recalled after acrimonious dissension between the Governor and Commissioner over the allocation of choice blocks in Adelaide. Colonel Gawler took his place and was also Resident Commissioner. He had a scheme of public works which was not approved and he too was recalled to be replaced by Governor Grey who had a policy of retrenchment. Eventually a constitution for self-government was framed in 1856 and an election of members took place in 1857. Voting in Burra took place in the original Burra Hotel. Voting then was open, with no secret ballot. The candidates were G.S. Kingston and Henry Mildred. Beer flowed freely and men shouted for either candidate and waved green or blue ribbons. Members did little for Burra for many years. By this time two or three fairly good schools had opened. Rev. Ibbetson, the Anglican minister was a chief mover in getting the Institute built and in securing a library.

[Thomas then goes on to talk of SA history generally and of the colony’s acquisition of the Northern Territory, rather than of matters of local concern.]

War Poem. Our Beloved Dead, by E.A. Ward.

‘Taxpayer’ writes annoyed that at a time when economy needs to be practised a hospital with a £1,000 subsidy from the Government is under-utilised due to ‘a “tiff” between the Hospital Board and Dr Ashton.’

The writer refers to the increased dangers in cases being sent to Jamestown or Adelaide instead of being handled locally. He calls for a public meeting to resolve the situation.

Burra Cheer-up Society farewelled Pte Charlie Ockenden on Friday and has received a photo of Pte W.G. Bruhn. The society has at last acquired a good piano.

Redruth Court, 17 October.

Martha Gentle [a daughter of Lucy Gully] was charged with assaulting a pensioner, Mr Henry R. Bartsch. Gentle did washing for him and he accused her children of breaking his door and stealing his sugar. This led up to the alleged incident, which had resulted in his spending 31⁄2 days in hospital. The evidence was conflicting with Gentle’s defence supported by Lucy Gully and Hetty Williams [presumably the Mrs Williams elsewhere described as the informant’s sister.] The case was dismissed.

John G. Sara writes suggesting the Kooringa Branch of the YMCA become the Burra Branch in view of the widespread appeal being made in its name.

L.A. Morrison writes on the Burra Hospital situation in support of the call for action. The Board members can presumably get a doctor from anywhere they wish or go anywhere for treatment – money is no object to a good many of them, but it is to the majority. Recently my child was seriously ill and required an operation and had to be taken to town: ‘it is no thanks to the Board that I was in time or that she never died on the way there. I know of several cases that have been sent away from here and the Burra Hospital is standing almost idle.’ It is time for action.

Burra Boy Scouts welcomed Seaman Fred Fuller at a social on Thursday evening. He was a founding member of the troop.

A.J. McBride writes as Chairman of the hospital Board in response to the letter of L.A. Morrison’s suggestion that the Board was well off and therefore indifferent to the sufferings of the poor. He says the first consideration has always been for the poor. There is nothing to prevent either of the doctors from admitting any patients they like to the hospital and attending to them as far as the Board is concerned. Burra people like Mr Morrison who take their sick to Adelaide or Jamestown etc. are helping those who want to see our hospital kept idle.

## The YMCA at Burra

[There is a series of confusing letters about the name of the YMCA in Burra and the title of the recently unveiled Honour Roll.]

Ernest W. Crewes writes assuring J.G. Sara that the steps needed to change ‘Kooringa District’ to ‘Burra & District’ on the Honour Roll are in hand.

[That seems straightforward except that the paper at the time of the unveiling the report says it was headed the ‘Burra District Honour Roll’.]

Then ‘Disgusted’ writes suggesting that Mr Sara should go to France and stop nitpicking over the title of the Honour Board.

[Even when I re-read the letter of J.G. Sara published the previous week I still got the impression he was asking for a change in the name of the local YMCA Branch and that the changing of the name on the roll was cited as a parallel, but with both Crewes and ‘Disgusted’ drawing very different conclusions the situation must have looked different at the time.]

Hon. Sec. G. Horner of the local YMCA writes saying that the official name of the local branch was chosen when it was formed two years earlier and was ‘Burra Auxiliary Committee YMCA Army Department’.

[The cause of the dispute was either the inappropriate narrowing of the scope of the Honour Roll which was expected to serve a larger area than the title apparently implied at first, or (perhaps ‘and’?) the inappropriateness of the narrow title of the Burra YMCA, when they were currently making a special appeal across the wider district.

In any case this was indicative of attitudes that can be seen emerging elsewhere indicating a feeling in the wider community that the town of Burra liked to bath in the glory of patriotic efforts that drew their strength from a much wider area that the name ‘Burra’ by itself seemed to imply. Mr Crewes later got into other difficulties over this and I.J. Warnes was outspoken on it as well. It probably is most prominent in the heated debate over the Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial that was yet to come.]

For many years he managed Sir John Duncan’s Gum Creek Station, until it was subdivided, when he bought a portion and lived there till his death. He married first Miss Dora Norris and they had three children: Herbert (with 3rd Light Horse in Egypt), Miss Vera Bowman (South Africa) & Miss Amy Bowman (at home). In 1903 he married Miss Jessie Radford and there are two children: John & May. He was a keen sportsman.

Burra Town Council.

Members of Council expressed their general view that they did not really approve of long terms of office for the mayoralty, but under the circumstances of war and with Mr Crewes’ tremendous energy and self-sacrifice they thought he should be supported for another year. [At least thus for Crs Dane, McWaters & Radford. Cr Harris hoped Mr Crewes would be returned and the views of Crs McBride and J.C. Killicoat are not reported – the latter being absent.]

Mr Crewes said he would willingly stand aside if another candidate would come forward, but one man approached had declined.

Burra Hospital Public Meeting Thursday 1 November.

The Institute was 75% full. The Mayor took the chair and he with Crs Dane and McWaters were the only Hospital Board members present.

W.G. Hawkes wrote from Koonoona dated 31 October that he had an important prior engagement. He thought the present management needed drastic alteration and was glad there was a meeting of the people. ‘As matters stand at present, the once noble institution is a wreck and no other result could have been expected from the reckless and indecent quarrelling with the medical profession that has signalised the Board for some time past.’

Thomas B. Ashton wrote a long letter.

He considered the present situation bad for the town and those of moderate means, but that it would not have occurred had he been treated fairly. He felt his presence could only lead to his adversaries accusing him of fomenting trouble. This would not help while the Chief Secretary was considering the matter of his exclusion from the Hospital. He was prepared, if asked, to explain any points arising. He was being careful of what he said for fear of litigation. He felt the Board had shown no genuine desire for information from the medical officers.

‘It is my duty to insist that patients in my care receive the treatment required as ordered . . . and I was not prepared to work in an institution which permits that principle to be invaded.’

‘I wrote for an explanation of the Board’s action in excluding me from the Hospital. Mt letter was not acknowledged, and consequently I stayed away from the Hospital under protest, in writing and without prejudice, notifying the Board to this effect, until I have heard whether the Chief Secretary endorses their action or otherwise.’

On 11 August 1917 the Board appointed Dr Ashton honorary surgeon without any application from him, which he said ‘demonstrates that their action in excluding me from the Hospital was unwarranted and unjust’. He points out that the patient, Mrs Morrison’s child, referred to last week in Mr McBride’s letter to the paper, was Dr Williams’ patient.

Mr G. Hann then moved for the resignation of the entire Board, their management not being in the best interests of the people and that they be replaced by an elected and representative Board.

He lists five reasons for this:

Large numbers of sick people, many not fit to travel, are seeking hospital treatment elsewhere.

Refusal of one doctor to work at the hospital under the present conditions.

Complaints re fees charged and the character of the accommodation.

Incomplete and unsatisfactory reports of Board meetings.

The Hospital is not keeping up its standard of a 20-bed hospital as registered in the Australian Trained Nurses Assoc. Or even the minimum recognised 10-bed standard.

E.J. Davey 2nd – not he said as Town Clerk, but as a ratepayer and secretary of the Foresters’ Lodge.

## XXXIX, 45, 7 Nov. 1917, page 3

When the Corporation bought the Hospital from SAMA in 1877 the people subscribed £500 and a condition of transfer was it was to be used as a hospital: a condition hardly being met.

The real purpose of the hospital was to treat the poor, which was why there was a Government grant. If Dr Ashton’s services had been dispensed with why had he been appointed Hon. Surgeon a few days later? Has the Board approached Dr Ashton with a view to a settlement?

Mr P. Roach: Wasn’t Dr Ashton invited to attend Board meetings?

Mr Davey: Board members had told him there was no hope of a reconciliation. When put to Dr Ashton he had said that because the Board had backed the nursing staff he would decline to enter the institution whilst the present Board controlled it.

A letter in the paper had said there was nothing to prevent either doctor practising at the hospital. It was strange that in the past month there had been one week when it was without any medical man at all. It was time the Chief Secretary took the matter in hand. The Board had to retire or be told by the Government to go. Ratepayers should see proper men were nominated and they should not allow the present Board to renominate themselves.

J.G. Sara moved a lengthy amendment asking the Chief Secretary to take such steps as he may deem necessary to get the hospital functioning properly.

H.H. Thomas 2nd and spoke in support and favoured leaving the resolution with the Chief Secretary. He did not believe either party had been guilty of any serious misdemeanour. The whole thing was trumpery and above all needed speedy resolution.

Cr Radford said the whole thing was a disgrace to someone. He supported the amendment, believing the original motion went too far. He believed the whole thing went back years. They had heard Dr Ashton’s defence, but there were always two sides. He thought the Board had some right to an enquiry. The old practice of the Board had run up expenses and the Chief Secretary had called for economy. And this had caused trouble in cutting expenses. The matter wanted thorough sifting. The Board had taken a stand which reacted on the members.

Mr P. Roach asked: ‘Why did the Board dispense with Dr Ashton’s services?’

Mr Crewes said he privately had no objection to telling ratepayers the reason.

If ratepayers subscribed £1,000 p.a. they could elect their own Board.

Mrs Ashton said Dr Ashton had never been given a reason for his dismissal.

Mr Lawn asked Mr Davey if anyone had been refused admission since the trouble began.

Mr Davey believed not, but a number would not seek it.

The Mayor explained that under present arrangements the Board was appointed by the Government and on the expiry of their term they signified to the Chief Secretary if they were willing to continue and were appointed as a matter of course. He did not know who sent along nominations when a vacancy occurred.

The amendment was lost with only eight supporting it and the motion carried overwhelmingly.

T.H. Woollacott asked if it were true the military authorities had cabled for Dr Steele’s return. Mr Crewes said he didn’t know. A delegation was elected to take the decision to the Chief Secretary.

Navy Day in Burra on 2 November was very successful. The effort was in aid of the Navy and Port Adelaide Seamen’s Mission. The street was decorated and the Rotunda decked in red, white and blue with placards around it calling on people to remember Jutland, Heligoland & the Cocos Islands. The Naval Band from Adelaide under Lt Argent attended. Mr J.N. Laurence represented the Seamen’s mission. The band arrived by the midday train and marched to Best Place where they played several selections before marching to Kooringa for a welcome lunch at the Burra Hotel. In the afternoon the various stalls in Market Square came to life selling souvenirs, buttons, cool drinks, flowers, lollies, luncheon and afternoon tea.

At 2.45 p.m. the Naval Band played unde Bandmaster Duffield and the Cheer-up Band played the National Anthem at 3 p.m. to introduce speeches by the Mayor, Lt Argent and Staff Surgeon Morris, interspersed with selections from both bands. At the end the bands united in selections before marching to the Cheer-up Hall for afternoon tea.

A union Jack from Mr J.M. McBride was sold on the Bugler system by Mr J.R. Wilkinson and raised £186-13-6 and a lifebuoy raised £39-6-0. J.M. McBride donated his gold button from Australia Day which raised a further £110. J. Gallagher ended up with it and he in turn donated it to Seaman Fuller’s father by whom it will be much valued.

Burra Hospital Board, Friday 16 November. The Premier, Hon. A.H. Peake, presided.

Present were: Messrs C. Bartholomaeus, J. McLaren*, I.J. Warnes*, Thomas McWaters, P.A. McBride, G.E. Dane, E.W. Crewes*, J.E.H. Winnall*, Secretary Frank Treloar and Doctors Ashton, Williams and Morris. [The paper manages to get the initials of those marked * wrong.]

(The Chairman, Mr McBride, was detained in Adelaide.)

The Premier expressed the hope that the meeting would restore harmony between the doctors and the Board. He desired to hear all sides and hoped that after all was aired differences might be reconciled.

Mr Winnall, Vice-Chairman:

He said he was to present the Board’s case. They felt they were on trial to some extent and he suggested they hear Dr Ashton first so the Board could answer the charges brought against them.

The Premier then read the resolution passed at the public meeting.

Mr McLaren said he was obliged to leave at noon and asked that any questions to be addressed to him be put before then.

Mr Winnall then put the case for the Board. He said the statements made by the deputation were not entirely accurate.

## XXXIX, 47, 21 Nov. 1917, page 3

With reference to Mr Hawkes, who says he has been a Board member for 15 years and resigned last January on account of the manner in which the Board conducted the affairs of the Hospital: he was not one of the most regular attenders. In his last year he attended 12 meetings, but in the previous year only 3. He was re-appointed last time only after advising the Chief Secretary he would attend. Mr Hawkes blamed the change in the Board on ‘a new element’ that came in about 5 years ago.

Mr Winnall then cited patient’s payments and free gifts since 1909 to show what the ‘new element’ had achieved in a financial sense. (In 1909 £371 and in 1917 £702.)

Mr Hawkes claimed the humiliation of the doctors resulted in a complete debacle because doctors will not now come to the hospital. This surprises the Board because on 26 March 1916 a letter was sent by the Board to the Chief Secretary. A committee of Mr McBride, Mr Hawkes and myself produced the letter, which was drafted by Mr Hawkes. It is hard to reconcile that letter with his statements at the deputation.

The letter drew the attention of the Chief Secretary to a serious difficulty that had arisen between the Board and Doctors Ashton and Williams. The difficulties have spread over a considerable period and have now reached such a critical stage that the Board feels the hospital is seriously imperilled. The Board sought assistance and direction. The essentials of the trouble are cited in the letter as:

The Board believed the Doctors were abusing the legitimate uses of the hospital to their personal gain at Government expense.

Despite repeated requests the doctors have refused to attend the usual meetings of the Board.

With reference to (1) above the Board believed that doctors had been sending cases to hospital that could reasonably have been treated at home, using hospital staff, the operating theatre, instruments and dressings. These patients are charged full fees by the Doctors and while the hospital is a convenience and concentrating point for the Doctors, these actions considerably increase the cost of its upkeep. Recently a single woman employed at 10/- a week and which the hospital regarded as a non-paying patient received a threatening letter from Dr Ashton’s solicitor demanding payment of £17 odd for medical attendance. This the Board strongly condemns. Under the rules the Board can refuse admission, but this is a grave responsibility and the Board must rely on the good faith of the Doctors as to proper cases for admission.

As regards (2) the refusal of the medical officers to attend monthly meetings of the Hospital Board and their determined attitude to evade any personal contact with it and their curt acknowledgement or total ignoring of communications with it, brought about the situation that is incompatible with the proper management of the hospital.

As well as the issues raised above their absence from meetings precludes the Board from professional advice on constantly occurring issues arising in the running of the institution.

Dr Ashton has recently said he would not attend a meeting with the Board until a certain resolution had been expunged from the Board’s minutes. The resolution is: ‘That the action of Dr Ashton in making a complaint against the nursing staff of the neglect of the enteric patient Riese is very unfair’. This took place at the board meeting on 15 August 1913. Dr Ashton was present and attended a subsequent meeting and apologised for not attending another.

On 8 January 1914 he resigned from the staff and left the district and on returning in 1915 accepted appointment as a medical officer of the hospital on 12 August 1915. He at no stage complained of the resolution in question. This suggests to the Board that the pretext for refusing to meet the Board is flimsy and has no relation to the situation.

Dr Williams is acting as locum tenens for Dr Steele, who is with the AIF and previous to last October he [Williams] had no knowledge of the hospital’s affairs.

The Board is fully aware of the gravity of the situation and has always sought to avoid aggravating the situation. The situation is now so deadlocked that an appeal to the Chief Secretary was seen as the only course available.

Dr Williams had instructions from Dr Steele to attend Board meetings and has done so.

This letter, drafted by Mr Hawkes, makes it difficult to see how he can later say in the deputation that the treatment of the Doctors by the Board is the cause of why they will not meet us.

Mr Hawkes said further at the deputation that an instance of the Board’s arbitrary management involved the treatment of a nurse. The Matron with 17 years’ experience applied for 9 months leave of absence without pay to take up obstetrics in Sydney. The Matron, he said, was ruthlessly turned down and as a result resigned. This is not true in substance or in fact. Nurse Morney [Mosey] started as a probationer and worked her way up to be Matron. No one can say a word against her. Her training however, was confined to this hospital and she had no experience in obstetrics, so she applied to a Sydney hospital to take a course there. When she approached me I said it would be hard to replace her for just that period and I thought it would be best if she resigned and when she returned she would have the best claim for first vacancy. Just before a Board meeting she saw Mr Hawkes and changed her views. At that meeting in June 1912 she asked for 12-months leave without pay. The Board considered they could not grant it as she was going for her own advantage to acquire qualifications we could not use and we could not replace her for 8 months. [sic] [12?]

After she put in her resignation her mother fell ill and she asked to be allowed to withdraw it. We agreed. Later in November she resigned and left under the best conditions with a social send-off and presentation.

It is not true Dr Steele was annoyed with the Board. Before he left he appointed me his attorney, so there can’t have been much wrong with my relations with him. Dr Steele was in sympathy with the Board (for which I can produce documents) and instructed his locum tenens to attend Board meetings.

Mr Hawkes asserts that the Board became obsessed with a grudge against Dr Ashton, who is the only man capable of conducting operations in Burra. I say that Dr Williams holds the same qualifications as Dr Ashton. There is no grudge against Dr Ashton.

Mr Hawkes also says that in his last fortnight on the Board a vacancy occurred and young Mr McBride was appointed. This is not true. Mr McBride was appointed in July and Mr Hawkes resigned in the following January. He goes on to comment on Mr McBride’s youth and lack of mature judgement.

## XXXIX, 47, 21 Nov. 1917, Supplement.

But this was a Government decision and nothing to do with the Board. Mr Hawkes says that when I asked the then Chief Secretary (Mr A.W. Styles) about the appointment he replied that a letter from Mr George Lawn had suggested Mr McBride as suitable. Mr Lawn is the town scavenger. He then says we (the Board?) feel the appointment should not have been made in this way. The Board knows of nothing that influenced the appointment. Mr Lawn is a strong Labor supporter and a letter to a Labor Government would have some weight, perhaps. Previous to the Verran Labor Government, when a vacancy occurred we would suggest a replacement. The Verran Government said we had no power to suggest or to nominate.

Mr Hawkes also says ‘the rude, rough, and ruthless treatment of the medical men by the Hospital Board has been the whole cause of the trouble.’ After writing the letter to the Chief Secretary already cited, this statement is inconceivable.

Mr Winnall then referred to the curt reply to the Board on 15 March 1916: ‘Your note of the 16th received. Yours T.B. Ashton and a. Evan Williams.’

Dr Ashton also said to Mr Warnes he should ‘come over into a quiet corner over the bridge and settle the matter’. If the board has been asked to resign we have no knowledge of it. Mr Winnall had been a Board member over 20 years.

Mr Winnall then turned to Mr Davey, who said he represented all the Friendly Societies. Mr Winnall disputed this. He was appointed a delegate at an ordinary meeting of the lodge for which no notice was given of the business.

Mr Davey asserts that surgical operations cannot be performed in Burra, but Dr Williams has an equal degree. When we appointed Dr Ashton an Honorary surgeon there were some who asked if he would co-operate with Dr Williams. Dr Ashton recently did refuse to consult with Dr Williams unless his instructions were carried out. Dr Ashton then said ‘It is no use my giving advice if it is not carried out.’

Mr Davey questions whether men appointed to the Board because they held high financial positions, were the best for that position. Mr Winnall said these men represent all classes.

[This seems a specious argument at best. They may have been representatives of the town, but they were certainly not drawn from all classes.]

Mr Winnall claims not to have a high financial position.

[Such matters are, of course, relative, but he was a solicitor and clearly at least comfortably off.]

He claimed the Board was as representative as possible – given that conflict of interest would preclude including any businessman likely to tender for hospital supplies.

Dr Ashton interjected to ask whether the Board ever called for a report.

Mr Winnall said that the Board always believed that Doctors were there to advise the Board on any matters and they do not have time to send for a report. What the Board asked was for the Doctors to attend meetings to see what is needed and enable the Board to deal with matters.

The Board has never interfered in substance or in fact between the Doctors and their patients in the legitimate workings of the institution.

Had the public had as full a knowledge of the facts as the Board, then the representation to the Government would have been very different. There are many more inaccuracies floating around the town. The resolution of the meeting is asking a good deal in demanding the Board resign without a hearing and that Dr Ashton be reinstated without hearing the facts. The reasons which actuated their resolution are puerile.

It is also asserted that the reports of Board meetings are incomplete and unsatisfactory.

The trouble began in August 1913 and on the 13 April 1916 there is a minute that the press be admitted to meetings. Until then they had not attended and the secretary gave them a report. The reports since 13 April 1916 are in the hands of the press and nothing to do with the Board.

As for training nurses. The Board wrote to the Australian Trained Nurses’ Association and they told us to carry on as usual.

Mr Winnall then returned to the cases in 1913 that seem to have initiated the trouble with Dr Ashton.

He read from a Board minute of 15 August 1913.

Matron reported that a patient (Terry) had left the hospital and returned under the influence of drink. Dr Ashton reported that while he was out Terry had called on him and complained that the nurses had neglected treating his leg. Matron and Nurse Dorrington were examined with the result that the charge of Terry being intoxicated was sustained and the charge of neglect against the nurses lapsed.

Mr Winnall continued, saying that Dr Ashton said Terry was not drunk when he called on him. We called on Terry, who admitted that he was drunk on his return and he said he had no complaints of neglect to make. This was the first conflict with Dr Ashton.

Dr Ashton interrupted to claim that Terry was browbeaten.

Mr Winnall reverted to the minute of 15 August 1913.

Dr Ashton complained that an enteric patient of his had been allowed to get up during the night and he asked if the nursing staff could be considered satisfactory if that happened. The Matron explained that the patient had sat up in bed during the absence of the nurse who was busy with a patient in an adjoining ward. She had left a convalescent patient on watch and he reported to the nurse as quickly as possible. The resolution was passed ‘That the action of Dr Ashton in making a complaint against the nursing staff of neglect of the enteric patient is very unfair.’

[This case was that of Mr Riese who was a delirious typhoid patient who died suddenly when sitting up in bed.]

Mr Winnall continued. The patient was a ward patient with no special nurse and the nurse in charge had to treat him with other patients. Dr Ashton says in his letter that the Board minute says he had been cruelly unfair to nursing staff, but I did not say that. At the next meeting there was an apology for his absence and then he left the district, coming back after two years.

[Earlier in the statement this time interval was said to be from January 1914 to August 1915.]

When he returned he accepted an appointment as a medical officer of the hospital and remained so until he said he would not come to meetings whilst that resolution remained on the books.

Dr Ashton again interrupted: ‘History repeated itself. It occurred again.’

Mr Winnall continued. Dr Ashton wrote that certain enteric patients needed special attention, which the Matron said was impossible with the present staff. In view of the Riese case Dr Ashton asked for steps to be taken to remedy this. Mr McBride went out at 10 p.m. to obtain another nurse.

Dr Ashton interjected that it only happened because he said if a death occurred he would not sign the certificate and would write to the coroner.

Mr Winnall resumed. Mr McBride did it: he went and got Nurse Fuss at 10 o’clock at night.

Mr Winnall then turned to orders for surgical instruments, which he said amounted to £15 worth, which were ordered without any Board knowledge or approval, after the Doctors had just submitted a list for £2 worth.

Dr Ashton returned in August 1915 and there is a resolution of the Board that he be appointed medical officer in place of Dr Sangster and in October 1915 a resolution of the Board asked the Doctors to attend meetings of the Board. On 9 March Dr Ashton was written to drawing his attention to the closing portion of his letter of the 16 February and asking him to explain it. He did not reply.

On 30 March 1916 Dr Morris, Inspector of Hospitals, attended a special meeting of the Board and Dr Ashton was asked to attend to thrash matters out, but he did not. On 13 April a letter to Dr Ashton asked for a reply to the Board’s letter of 11 March.

Dr Ashton’s reply of 27 April was then read.

[This letter went back to revisit the Riese case and on that basis said conferences with the Board had proved unsatisfactory. In reporting the incident to the Board Dr Ashton said he recommended that further nursing staff be obtained and this, he said, was interpreted as an attack on the nursing staff and the resolution ‘That Dr Ashton had been grossly unfair to the nursing staff’ was passed. The letter went on to say that this was an improper way to receive suggestions from the medical officers. It continued:]

It was in view of this that Dr Ashton’s letter was written in the last epidemic, when again there were delirious typhoid patients and the additional necessary nursing staff were not forthcoming. In regard to the resolution of the Board that medical officers get permission of the Local Board of Health before sending infectious cases to the hospital we submit that cases are recommended by us as fit cases for treatment in hospital in a medical sense in our capacity as private medical practitioners and the Board has no power to dictate the conduct of our private practice, but can refuse patients admission at their own discretion. Hence the terse acknowledgement. We feel we should not be implicated with the financial side of the institution and the Board should make its own arrangements with the Local Board of Health for the responsibility of payment for infectious cases. The lack of such arrangements complicates the conduct of private work in the town. The resolution of the Board placing obstacles in the way of admitting children of tender years is especially prejudicial to the interests of children suffering from diphtheria and other acute diseases requiring constant skilled nursing. We have no desire to interfere with the Board’s legitimate powers, but draw attention to the fact that the hospital has only two fully qualified nurses plus the Matron who has many administrative duties.

Signed Thomas B. Ashton

Signed A. Evan Williams

Mr Winnall then said the Mayor knows we have no claim against the local authorities in infectious disease cases unless they are admitted by the medical officer of the district or town. As they come from many districts we suggested that the consent of the Local Board be obtained so we might collect the fees from the Local Board of Health concerned. The Adelaide Hospital has consent without getting it in every case. We have an agreement with the Burra Town Council. It would be an easy matter to get into communication with the town or district clerk for the necessary consent.

Dr Ashton interjected to dispute the ease of doing this.

The discussion then moved to the issue of the admission of babes in arms. Dr Ashton saying it was a question of saving lives. There was nowhere else to send them. To which Mr Winnall’s reply was that the hospital did not have the staff to deal with babes in arms and could not accept them. They (the Board) have had to complain to Dr Ashton for doing it. He then said the nurses were not getting the lectures required.

On 16 April 1916 there was a resolution passed asking for a conference with the Doctors. The Doctors refused and sent the letter cited of 27 April 1916.

A further special request to attend was sent on 18 May, with no action from the Doctors.

Dr Ashton then conveyed through Mr Hawkes that he would not attend until the resolution of 15 August 1913 was rescinded.

It was then that the matter was referred to the Chief Secretary, through a letter drafted by Mr Hawkes as already outlined.

A further effort to meet with the Doctors was made in July 1916, but nothing eventuated and on 14 December Mr Crewes reported that the committee had still been unable to arrange a meeting.

The matter was again referred to the Chief Secretary on 14 September 1916, saying a meeting with the Doctors had not been possible and the Board could not carry on the management under the present circumstances.

The Board had then let matters drift.

A full explanation was made through the Inspector General of Public Hospitals.

After we discharged Dr Ashton as a medical officer me did all he could to hamper us. He sent a telegram to the Chief Secretary about patients not being admitted and to the Inspector General that we would not admit an indigent patient requiring observation. When I rang him Dr Ashton said the patient’s name was Harrison and I knew Harrison was earning £7 or £8 per week and we could not admit such as an indigent patient.

Dr Ashton’s Dismissal.

The hospital was short staffed and a series of appendicitis cases were coming in. The staff was overworked and having a difficult time. The Matron asked if operations could be arranged for early morning or late afternoon to ease staffing arrangements. Dr Ashton refused to be accommodating. He would arrange an operation for 10, turn up at 11.45 and run through the dinner hour. When Matron remonstrated with him he told her she was ‘Too damned tired.’

Nurse Fuss said ‘I won’t stop if Cr Ashton is going to contradict his orders the way he does.’

Mr Winnall said despite advertising it was impossible to get nurses and if the Matron were to leave they would have to close. There was a cancer case and Dr Ashton said he would operate in the morning, but in the morning he changed his mind. Winnall then took the decision to admit no more until staffing improved. He wrote to Dr Ashton asking that he put his instruction to nurses in writing – the nurses had been frightened after the Riese case. Dr Ashton refused to write instructions and we decided he had to go. There have been cases where Dr Ashton has operated in an emergency. We appointed him honorary surgeon so he could come in and give the anaesthetic or carry out the operation if necessary.

Dr Ashton asked: ‘You did not seriously expect me to treat wealthy people without any fees?’

Dr Morris said that he thought there had been a misunderstanding.

There was then a discussion about who paid fees and who did not.

In the Adelaide Hospital there were no private patients, so it was different.

The Chairman pointed out that there were clearly some misunderstandings and the doctor’s position with regards to private patients in the hospital needs to be made clear.

Mr Winnall then referred to a letter of Dr Ashton’s quoted by Mr Davey in his letter about lodges. Dr Ashton says in it: ‘I am not disposed to undertake any operations until a proper guarantee is obtained that my instructions concerning the treatment of a patient will be carried out without alterations.’

We know of no occasion when this has not been done and the Matron says she knows of none either.

Dr Ashton continues [in the letter] ‘it is positively criminal to the patients to allow the whims of irresponsible persons to endanger the patients’ lives.’

We are charitable enough to assume that was directed at the Board rather than the nursing staff, where the accusation would be much more serious. But this imputation must be wiped out before any reconciliation can be considered. We have had difficulties since 1913 with Dr Ashton and he has refused to talk things over. Now when the Matron and the nurses would leave us we were compelled to dispense with Dr Ashton’s services.

If you ask me to resign I am willing to go. If my colleagues think there should be an enquiry, then there should be one. With respect to the deputation, will you ask us to resign without an enquiry?

We ask for a proper investigation into the affair and that we not be asked to resign without a much fuller investigation than has been possible today.

Mr Warnes then spoke of Dr Ashton’s offer to settle the matter on a plot by the bridge, but was mostly concerned with expressing his disappointment with Mr Hawkes’ contribution to the debate after he resigned from the Board. He adds little of substance to the story, but reminds us that Dr Ashton’s dismissal was carried with only Mr Crewes dissenting.

Dr Ashton contended that his whole dispute with the Board had been over his insistence that his patients should be properly cared for. Lives depended on it. He also referred to the incident with Mr Warnes in a rather ambiguous way: seeming to assert it both was and was not a proper challenge.

Dr Morris questioned Winnall on the refusal to admit patients.

Winnall said: Yes, only emergency cases, as Nurse Fuss had signalled her intention of leaving and the present staff would have been unable to cope with more patients at that time.

The Chairman (The Premier) considered they ought to be able to get together and talk and let the past go by. The hospital is struggling and we must consider the interests of the patients. A little forbearance and a strong desire to get the institution on a firm footing and you should be able to come to an understanding.

Mr Crewes said if the amendment at the public meeting had prevailed it would have covered that ground. Mr Crewes had suggested at the next meeting that in lieu of Dr Ashton being discharged a letter should be sent to the doctor seeking a conference for the express purpose of putting the past behind them. Dr Ashton to be reinstated and a guarantee that the rules of the institution should be carried out with respect to nurses and all other matters.

The Chairman said he was happy to give them a fortnight to settle matters themselves before taking further action. If you cannot settle it ‘you will communicate with me and I will know what steps to take’.

Dr Morris said there were only two points of difference.

The Chairman said it was largely a question of temper:

‘I am not a judge in this case. I have no power to give a verdict; I can only form my own opinion.’

## XXXIX, 48, 28 Nov. 1917, page 2-3

E.J. Davey wrote concerning the Burra Hospital Meeting with the Premier.

He writes in response to Mr Winnall.

[Whose approach was quite legalistic and sounded like a defence presented in court.]

Mr Winnall said the public meeting decision was a result of misconception and lack of knowledge. The Board at no time placed the facts before the public. The public was fully convinced that the situation was intolerable. The resolution passed almost unanimously and the petition received 400-500 signatures and as many more could have been easily obtained after that. My letter was not a Foresters’ letter. On 26 September a letter was sent to all Friendly Societies saying that on 25th a meeting of Court Unity discussed the hospital situation and the opinion of the Court was that something must be done to clear the atmosphere. Enclosed are copies of the letters sent to Dr Ashton and received from him. I ask that your Board of Management meet the Members of my Board in the Lodge Room at the Institute 2 October to discuss the matter with a view of laying something before a combined meeting of Lodges.

This conference was duly held with three delegates from each of the Friendly Societies and it was resolved to send a letter to the Chief Secretary pointing out the serious position in which the Lodges were placed by the disagreement between Dr Ashton and the Hospital Board. The letter was written and signed by the Chairman & Secretary of each Lodge.

Mr Winnall is wrong in asserting it did not come from the whole of the Lodges. ‘I grant Mr Winnall that he is a member of the Foresters’ Lodge and also a trustee, but I do not think he is as fully interested as he might be, otherwise we should see him at the meetings more often than once in six years. When a full reply is received from the Chief Secretary a further combined meeting of all members concerned will be held.

Mr Winnall asserts the Hospital board is fully representative, but public opinion is otherwise. If the Board would not accept the advice of the medical men, the Board are surely at fault.

The public feel that the only solution is for the Board to resign. Having now had the facts placed before them from the inquiry of the 16th instant, I believe the public opinion is unchanged.

As for the letter drafted by Mr Hawkes: I believe he drafted it at the request of the Board, never having the intention of signing it himself and it expresses the views of the Board, not his own. As for the appointment of Mr McBride: it was not Mr Hawkes who first objected. The Record of 9 July 1916 shows it was Mr McLaren who suggested the Board respectfully protest the appointment and Mr Warnes 2nd.

## XXXIX, 48, 28 Nov. 1917, page 3

W.G. Hawkes writes re the hospital crisis.

He says he sympathises with Mr Winnall in his difficult position.

‘His legal vampings must be viewed with tolerance, but I am afraid he has not improved the dire situation.’

‘I ask you to allow me to traverse some of his remarkably elastic liberties and deductions.’

I am a Board member of some 20 not 15 years. My attendance was never very regular, but I was always in keen touch with the affairs of the hospital. Things went smoothly for years until a ‘new element’ came in with a policy of management.

‘Part of this policy was to use an axe where a pen knife would have answered the purpose.’

He then takes on the issue of Matron Mosey’s requested leave of absence and takes the view she was treated very badly for one with 17 year’s service. He denies seeing her before the Board meeting. When she left she did indeed have a social, a presentation and well-wishers, but where were the Board? Where were the appropriate speeches from Board members? As far as most of them were concerned ‘it was a dull soulless gathering’.

While denying that Dr Steele was told to mind his own business over this matter Mr Winnall does attempt to gloss it over by saying ‘although some such expression was on one occasion used by Mr Bartholomaeus to Dr Steele.’

Would ‘such an expression, or anything approaching it have been allowed under the old Board.’

Mr Winnall says: ‘That in all our dealings with the doctors we have tried to be gentlemen.’

They have been the reverse, not only in concrete cases, but also in distrust, suspicion and indirect thrusts more difficult to pin down.

One specific case – they gave notice to the doctors severely restricting their rights to admit patients and handing that prerogative largely to members of the Board. This was a clumsy and stupid departure that had to be rescinded. The humiliating motion against Dr Ashton that he had been unfair to nursing staff was not conducive to discipline and obedience. As for offering the Doctor the position of honorary surgeon: this amounts to saying ‘You are discharged for bad conduct, but we expect you to come and help us when we are in extremis and the blame is on you if you don’t.’

‘I believe this motion was made by that courageous and youthful expedient Mr P.A. McBride. The letter I drafted was but an embodiment of the Board’s views, not all my own views by any means. It was the Chairman’s letter.

Mr Winnall endeavours to involve me in an attack upon Mr George Lawn’s occupation, but I honour every man’s legitimate calling equally as much as either of these two gentlemen. [Winnall & Warnes]

To suggest that the work of the Board was hung up because of a question over my reappointment was simply nonsense. How many vacancies are there at present – and why have they not been filled?

‘Mr Winnall’s plaintive appeal on behalf of his Board, and his shedding of crocodile tears, has not helped the position.’

‘I understand that the Board’s hope is in the return of Dr Steele, a hope we all most cordially endorse.’

‘Their experience may protrude upon their minds the fact that a hospital might be run without a Board, but never without doctors and nurses.’

Ratepayers’ Annual Meeting, Monday.

Only about 25 persons attended. Rev. A.J. Finch took the chair.

Cr Harris said a fair amount of kerbing had been done in East Ward and a garden established at the Black Bridge.

Cr Dane reported on a series of relatively minor or mundane achievements for West Ward.

Cr Radford did the same for North Ward, though he did report the installation of private letterboxes (finally) at the Aberdeen Post Office. They were trying to get a pillar or two for Aberdeen, as people were charged extra for mailing letters at the station.

There was concern at the lower rate income in North Ward with its large number of roads to service. Lighting was a major problem. It was impossible to carry on with the present rate and yet not justifiable to increase it. More trees were required. Gums were dying and the pines had not been very successful.

Mr Greenwood had little to say in support of his candidacy for East Ward.

The mayor thanked all for his re-election unopposed. He believed that but for the war they would have had a worthy lighting scheme by now.

E.J. Harris had little to add.

Mr Kellaway questioned the paying of the curator 8 weeks full time while he was sick in May 1916, but Mr Crewes and other Councillors backed the proceeding, which they said had not been concealed, but overlooked. All Councillors were in favour of a bridge at the Pig & Whistle when possible.

## XXXIX, 48, 28 Nov. 1917, page 4

The Mayor’s Report for 1917.

The last wheat/hay harvest was exceptionally good, but the mice plague and the damp winter have led to severe losses in storage. The Government commandeered the crop and so far has paid 3/- a bushel. The coming harvest looks like also being a good one. The pastoral industry has been prosperous and lambing has been encouraging.

The war continues and the revolution in Russia and setbacks for the Italians have made it more difficult for the Allies. Burra & District have continued their strong support for all patriotic efforts.

The seaside trip on 24 February was a great success and over 1.000 adults and children went to Glenelg.

Burra Cheer-up Ladies’ Band

The Burra Coronation Band did creditable work, but as more and more boys enlisted it finally collapsed with only one or two players left. The idea of a Ladies’ Band emerged and Mr James Bentley was approached to do the tutoring. The old instruments, which were cheap to start with, were found to be mostly useless, but the girls set about raising money and were soon practising. Much of this effort was due to Cr McWaters. Since the foundation of the band Mr I.J. Warnes has proved a strong supporter, together with others on various occasions. The band has provided valuable assistance at all local patriotic occasions and has also visited Adelaide and other towns and been enthusiastically received by the public.

Anzac Day on 25 April saw a public demonstration in Market Square with a march of school children and speeches at the Rotunda.

A Memorial and Intercession Service was held in the Institute on 29 April and the hall was crowded. Addresses were given by the Mayor and Mr J.E.H. Winnall.

Repatriation Day on 9 March was held to provide funds to help our boys on their return. There was a procession headed by the Ladies’ Band and the Adelaide Locomotive Band visited. There were patriotic speeches by the Mayor and Messrs Hawkes, Winnall and Rev. S.J. Bloyd. A Union Jack was auctioned under the Bugler system and various stalls did brisk business. The Locomotive Band gave a concert in the Institute in the evening. A little over £2,000 was raised.

Red Cross Day on 1 June took the form of a fete in aid of Red Cross and Trench Comforts Funds with the sale of gifts in the Institute. About £225 was raised.

Violet Day on 6 July was held in appalling weather and the auction of a bunch of violets under the Bugler system raised £185 and the total for the day was £356, which under the circumstances was encouraging.

The Anniversary of the War on 5 August saw a large gathering in Market Square. The Ladies’ Band attended and speeches were delivered by the Mayor & Messrs W.G. Hawkes, J.E.H. Winnall, Rev. Father Prendergast, Captain Trigg & Mr H.J. Penno.

Australia Day was held on 1 September. The Ladies’ band again headed a procession. A gold button auctioned under the Bugler system realised £978 and became the property of R.J.M. McBride for £225. (The second highest bid was £200 by A.J. & P.A. McBride and the third £100 by Messrs Hawkes & Daskein.) The town’s patriotic societies took part – the Cheer-up Society, Soldiers’ Aid Soc., & Red Cross. A picture show in the evening raised £40-16-0 and the total for the day was c. £2,000. World’s End Friends contributed c. £30 and the Burra School Fife & Drum Band and the Boy Scouts gave valued assistance.

Navy Day on 2 November again saw a visiting band – The Naval Band from Adelaide. They and the Ladies’ Band contributed to the success. £700 was raised for the men of the Navy and Mercantile Marine. Speeches were made by the Mayor, Lt Argent, Staff-Surgeon Morris and Mr Lawrence. There was a concert in the evening at the Institute.

YMCA Red Triangle Day on 12 October saw the sale of buttons and a burning candle guessing competition raise c. £50.

Burra Cheer-up Society continues its good work with regular weekly meetings and farewell socials and a parcel for departing boys. Soldiers and sailors returning are met at the station by the Ladies’ Band and a welcome home social is given later. In January 2,250 khaki handkerchiefs were despatched, 400 Christmas puddings were also despatched and £20 provided for cigarettes and tobacco. Christmas Boxes for 50 nurses at No. 14 Hospital in Egypt were also provided. Much valuable help has also been given the Adelaide Society. Many grateful notes have been received from recipients of these gifts.

Soldiers’ Aid Society is doing many of the things that the Cheer-up Society does, especially making comfortable and useful clothing for the troops.

Patriotism. We believe the district has raised about £45,000 for the war effort and about 500 local young men have volunteered.

The Boy Scouts under Scoutmaster Rigney are doing splendid work in the town and for the patriotic efforts.

The Supreme Sacrifice has now been made by about 54 local men and many others have been severely wounded.

On Australia Day a handsome Honour Roll was presented to the town by Mr & Mrs C.J. Pearce, containing the names of Burra & District Boys who have fallen in the war. Lt-Col. Beevor unveiled it and Scout Patrol Leader Tiddy sounded The Last Post. It is now fixed at the public reading room of the Institute.

[A detailed statement of income and expenditure then follows.]

Rates collected for the year amounted to £945-13-0.

North Ward £142-11-0

East Ward £171-0-0

West Ward £152-11-0

All wards ended the year in credit: North & East with about £21 each and West about £42.

Parklands. Dead trees have been removed and replaced and hundreds of trees added. Wanton destruction of trees continues to be a problem. A garden has been planted by the Black Bridge in Kooringa. The account began in debit £23 and ended in debit £3-5-8.

The Cemetery. The main expenditure has been in repairing the walls for £28-8-6 and in painting for £10-5-0. The year opened in credit £140 and ends in credit £113.

The main roads grant was £430.

Tar paved roads previously done have been attended to. We look forward to tar paving all the main thoroughfares.

Local Board of Health. Started the year in credit £101-11-0 and ended in credit £47-13-6.

Lighting. This account opened in credit £3-1-8 and closes in debit £6-18-4. Carbide was very dear this year and greatest care had to be exercised. The town has 20 lights and each one costs over £7-10-0 to maintain and yet the results are far from satisfactory. Improvement to a more up-to-date system is needed, but will have to await the end of the war.

Carbide costs for the year £71-7-7

Lighting [Lamplighters] £70-1-0

The Corporation owns 2 horses, 2 drays, 1 water-cart, 1 road-roller, 1 hand-roller, 1 sanitary cart, 1 tar sprinkler plus tools etc.

In general the town has made satisfactory progress considering the war raging. Many new and substantial houses have been erected. Roads have been reclaimed and new gardens formed. The appearance of the town has improved. The telephone system has been extended. With stock, wool and produce prices high only the return of peace is a hindrance to prosperity.

[Check this last statement, which surely is the opposite of what was said!]

I thank citizens for conferring on me the honour of filling this important position. I had intended to retire ‘for I feel that . . . in normal times two years should be the longest period a person should hold the position.’

Municipal Election.

East Ward J. Greenwood 84 elected

E.J. Harris 74

Informal 2

This turnout was remarkable. There were 240 names on the roll and 177 possible voters allowing for absences etc. 160 of 177 possible electors voted, or a turnout of c. 90%.

Fire. A large fire has been raging for several days out east. The Mutooroo Pastoral Co. has lost 500-600 square miles of feed, but no loss of stock and the fire is under control as a result of successful firebreaks.

On Quondong J.H. Gallagher has lost c. 100 square miles of bush and grass and miles of fencing. Loss of stock is unknown. It is believed to have started from lightning.

Thomas B. Ashton writes concerning the settlement offered by the Hospital Board as already reported. A reply by Wednesday is requested.

Dr Ashton wrote on 28 November that he had to submit his reply to his solicitor before sending it, as the trouble is mixed with pending litigation.

The requirement to attend Board meetings when required cannot be met with an unqualified undertaking, due to the nature of a doctor’s calling.

I am unable to acquiesce in the implied suggestion that my dismissal was not the consequence of my non-compliance with the instruction to give instructions to the Matron and charge-nurses in writing.

‘The intimation did not contain the words ‘general instructions’ and was not given by the secretary, but by Mr Winnall himself, in a letter written on his professional letter paper, containing reference to the resignation of Nurse Fuss.’

‘Dr Williams . . . was not favoured with a similar intimation to give direction to nurses in writing, though he did receive similar intimation re Nurse Fuss.’

For my comments on the foregoing and the Board’s letter to me of 11 August 1917 appointing me Honorary Surgeon Mr Winnall has launched an action for libel against me. The writ was served after I left the meeting, which I attended on the invitation of the Chief Secretary.

He then goes on to discuss mention of ‘cupidity’ against ‘one of the Medical Officers’ and the case mentioned before where it was alleged he unreasonably sought payment from a servant. He denies any improper or inappropriate actions.

‘I regret that until the subsequent development of the libel action is disposed of, bygones cannot be bygones nor do I think that matters offensive to me, where they touch the feeling of a gentleman, should be treated as bygones until the Board show by their readiness to extinguish all offensive significance (if any) about such matters, that they are also prepared to treat them as bygones.’

War Savings Groups.

The movement to form groups in Burra got off to a good start on Friday when Mr George Brookman spoke in Market Square and in the evening at the Institute. A canvas of the hall resulted in promises to purchase £2,253 worth of war certificates.

Obituary. Pte Clarence Melvin Humphrys was wounded 29 July and died 6 October. He was the second son of Mr & Mrs E.T. Humphrys of Hanson and was born in Burra 10 October 1893. He was educated at Hanson School and then worked with his father and brothers on the farm before enlisting in February 1916, arriving in England in September 1916. He sprained an ankle badly after some time and was in hospital for a month, returning to the trenches to fight till 29 July when he cut his foot badly on a barbed wire spike. He had been convalescent before he died. He was a member of the Hanson Methodist Church and of the choir. He was also Sabbath School Librarian, Assistant Librarian and a local preacher, a member of the Rechabites and of the Farrell’s Flat Rifle Club. He was a grandson of the late Luke Tiddy of Burra and of the late Jessy [Jesse] Humphrys of Hanson.

Obituary. Pte George Hill died of wounds at 53 Casualty Clearing Station on 19 November. He was the third son of Mr & Mrs R. Hill of Kooringa and was born 23 Feb 1892 at Kooringa. He was educated at Burra School and then worked in the Record office, and then for Dr Sangster Senior and Mr T. Sandland on Koo-owie & Belah Stations for 2 years before going to Mulyungarie Station on the Mutooroo Country, from where he enlisted in March 1916. He left Australia in June 1916 and after being some time in camp on Salisbury Plain he left for France in November 1916. He was severely wounded 9 December in the left thigh, only to return to the firing line in October 1917. He had many friends on the sporting field. The Hill brothers were well known sprinters and he was a footballer. Sam, who died in France on 1 January 1917, was his brother. Two other brothers are in Egypt: Ben in the Camel Corps and Horace in the 9th Light Horse. A younger brother, Charlie, is in Kooringa and a sister, Mrs T. Quinn, is at World’s End.

Burra Red Cross, Half-Yearly Meeting.

Mrs C.J. Pearce reported. We regret the departure of Mrs Harcus, the late secretary who left the district. The half-year has been rather quiet as far as making garments. There are lots of goods on hand, but a glut on the market and no shipping facilities. A spinning display raised over £14 on 17 July. On 26 July the Red Cross helped the Cheer-up Society on Violet Day. We also participated in Australia Day. The buttons we sold raised c. £120.

The Children’s Fancy Dress Carnival was a success and raised £25. We assisted other patriotic societies on Navy Day.

Weather. A thunderstorm on Tuesday afternoon was the fiercest for many years. Heavy rain and very vivid lightning was accompanied by the continuous roar of thunder. Many who were outside were thrown to the ground by the concussion of one bolt. Messrs George Lawn & Rose received the full force of it on Mr McBride’s farm and were considerably dazed. Another even louder noise and more intense flash occurred as people made their way to the Referendum Meeting. George March’s cab horses bolted and crashed into trees opposite C.J. Pearce’s shop, damaging the cab and smashing the pole. In one afternoon shower 88 points fell and in all 1.27” was recorded. T.J. Hams lost a horse struck by lightning at Ironmine. Dollard Brothers lost 90 tons of hay burnt by a lightning strike at Leighton. Another stack at P. Reddin’s Booborowie was also ignited, but saved. Many smaller fires were started throughout the district.

Mr McBride has given the Mayor £3-3-0 for groceries for the poor at Christmas – though he doesn’t think those who go to the pictures each week deserve so much as others.

Mr A. Litchfield, Burra Stationmaster for five years, has been moved to Riverton. Mr & Mrs Litchfield will be missed at St Mary’s Church where they have been great workers and in all things patriotic too.

Referendum Meeting. Burra Institute on Tuesday 11 December.

Hon. R.P. Blundell, Minister for Industry and Mr Peter Reidy MP spoke to a fairly large audience (reduced no doubt by the downpour just before the start). They supported the YES vote at the referendum on conscription. [Referred to as the Reinforcements Referendum: it was to bridge the gap between numbers required and volunteers coming forward.]

Mr Winnall presided, as Mr Crewes was stormbound in Clare on his way back from Adelaide by road. The Cheer-up Ladies’ Band began the night’s proceedings.

The speeches are reported in 12⁄3 columns.

Electric Lighting Scheme Revived.

At Burra Town Council on Monday Messrs Christie & Gardiner, consultant engineers of Melbourne, offered to draw up a report and give an estimate of the cost of lighting Burra with electricity. The report is to be gratis. The cost of the plant would be £5,000 to £5,400. The engineers had inspected the town at the Mayor’s invitation. They considered a scheme would pay and suggest a powerhouse site between Kooringa and Aberdeen. The railways would be a customer. They showed balance sheets from various plants they had installed with the cost to consumers, and each was very payable. The mayor though something needed to be done at once if at all since several residents were on the point of installing private schemes. Mr Lord had already done so. Mr Crewes had just had time to cancel an order for his firm and Mr Clark was holding off on a Council decision.

Cr Radford moved the offer be accepted.

‘The present lighting scheme would be a disgrace to a wayside pub.’

The Mayor said £5,000 at 6% would cost £300 and at present they paid £150 per year for 20 miserable lights, which often would not burn.

## Civil Court [Supreme Court SA]

After almost a month’s litigation the case of the land dispute between R.J.M. McBride of Burra and his daughter Mrs Caroline Sandland for possession of Flagstaff was settled on Saturday morning. His Honour gave a verdict in favour of the defendant. He judged the original agreement of 22 August 1895 valid and the defendant had the right to purchase the land after the plaintiff’s death for £4,167, the cost price. In the meantime she was entitled to retain possession on paying the rent of £208-7-0. The plaintiff to pay costs.

Burra Hospital Enquiry.

Mr Morris, Inspector General of Hospitals gave some purely formal evidence.

Mr E.J. Davey (Town Clerk) gave evidence as representative of the Foresters’ Lodge. He thought the enquiry was more to do with the Hospital Board and Dr Ashton. Two Lodge patients required operations for appendicitis, but owing to the disagreement Dr Ashton refused to act and one was sent to Adelaide and the other to Jamestown. He had refused to treat any Lodge patients in the hospital. Many other cases had been sent away and he thought it a disgrace and a position to be altered at any cost to the Board.

There was some legalistic sort of quibbling from the Board about what the Lodge’s complaint was and what Mr Davey expected of the Hospital and what area the patients should be admitted from.

Dr Smith elicited information that the Local Board of Health agreement with the Board concerning the payment for infectious cases had not been signed due to laxness on both sides and that the Government subsidy had in part been used to pay for cases for which the Local Board of Health should have been responsible.

Frank Treloar had been hospital secretary for c. 17 years. He produced figures to show average daily occupancy of patients in his early years had been 28, 30, 29. It then fell to c. 20 until 1916 when it was 15. In the months so far for 1917 they figures were: 9, 10, 10, 13, 14, 12, 10, 9, 6, 6, 7. The Hospital had 35 beds plus private rooms. (The latter at 10/- a day and the ward beds at 5/- a day.)

District Councils subscribed £5-5-0 each, but of recent times the Town Council had not.

Dr Smith wondered why Board Members did not recommend patients.

Mr Treloar said it was allowed under Rule 18, but the Medical Officers objected when it was tried.

There was no agreement with the Lodges over patients. Such patients’ payment was decided on their ability to do so. He believed the cause of the trouble was the Medical Officers’ refusal to attend Board meetings. Dr Williams had done so recently.

Dr Williams said he came to Burra on 2 October 1915 as locum tenens for Dr Steele. He did not think there was any seniority as to the Medical Officers at the Hospital. He had treated Lodge patients at the Hospital, sending them in without enquiring as to payment. At present staff were sufficient and he had no complaint about the attendance given. Dr Ashton had assisted at operations, but not recently and about two months before had refused to administer an anaesthetic. On another occasion he had refused to have a consultation, as it would have been Dr Williams’s orders that were carried out. Doctors reserved the right to charge patients, except Lodge patients, apart from Hospital fees. He attended some Board meetings and did not think it unreasonable and had no complaints about the Board. He had no similar experiences elsewhere. In Victor Harbor Lodge Patients were looked after at home: facilities for them in Burra were much greater. In country hospital with only one doctor the Matron or someone else administers the anaesthetic.

W.G. Hawkes said he had been a member of the Board for 20 years until January 1917, when he did not accept reappointment. Of recent years the Board had not worked amicably. He cited the Sister Mosey incident and Mr Bartholomaeus telling Dr Steele to ‘mind his own business’. Mr Hawkes thought that improper and said so at the next meeting. When it was proposed to allow Board members only to admit patients the doctors continued on the old way and he felt members could not have the responsibility. He then repeated his motion where Dr Ashton was said to have been unfair to a nurse. He was not then present, but considered such a motion to make good working conditions impossible and it could have been handled in a different way. But above all it was the demeanour of the Board that had created distrust between doctors and the Board. Had he been on the Board he would have opposed the dismissal of Dr Ashton.

Mr Mitchell asked if the Board was offensive in renouncing their right to admit patients – practically a rule in all hospitals. He asked if it had occurred to Mr Hawkes that the doctors might have intended to injure the Board.

Mr Hawkes thought Dr Ashton had been goaded, but he could not defend him entirely.

Mr Mitchell then asked a question containing a double negative re the offensive motion: apparently suggesting the matter should have been raised on Dr Ashton’s return and reappointment.

When Mr Mitchell was looking for support for the antagonism in the minutes Mr Hawkes said it was not there.

Dr Smith asked if the Board was really out of line in refusing Nurse Mosey’s request and Mr Hawkes conceded that they had a right to decide. When Dr Smith tried to elicit who would benefit by her studies Hawkes equivocated.

Dr Smith: ‘If an employer [sic] refused to do his duty until you withdrew insulting words, what would you do?

I would dismiss him but I would not put him on again.’

[The context needs ‘employee’ rather than ‘employer’.]

Asked if the Hospital could continue with one doctor Mr Hawkes was sure it could not.

Dr Smith pointed out to George Hann that if you went to a public hospital you could not expect to choose your own doctor unless you paid 10/- for private accommodation and then if your own doctor doesn’t attend it is his fault.

Mr Treloar was recalled and said he had notified Dr Ashton of his appointment as an honorary Surgeon with the same status as at the Adelaide Hospital – Dr Ashton had not accepted the position.

Sister Mildred, Matron since March 1917 and previously charge sister since November 1915 (except for 6 months sick leave) said she had no complaints about Dr Williams or the Board and was not aware Dr Ashton had made any complaints about her to the Board. On one occasion he wanted to operate at 11 a.m. and she had said it was very inconvenient, as they were short handed and she requested any time after 6 a.m. or 4 p.m., so she might have the aid of the night nurses. He had said ‘Be damned to you, it is none of your business, you want to manage my business. If you don’t do as I say, I will report you to the Inspector-General of Hospitals.’

The doctor’s desired arrangement was a practical impossibility. The charge nurse was away on examination, there was only one junior nurse, a probationer, on day duty, the ward could not be left and the witness required help in the theatre. The operation was postponed.

Dr Ashton’s preferred time for operations was to start about 8 p.m., which meant the nurses who had worked all day were up till 1 and 2 a.m., as there was no one to relieve them. So far as the matron could judge some of the operations were not urgent. Some cases had been in the hospital a fortnight and other arrangements could easily have been made. She had reported the matter concerning the patient whose case had initiated the trouble to the Board.

One day Dr Ashton came to the hospital at 11.40 and asked a nurse if she had the patient in the theatre at 11 a.m. The nurse said she knew nothing about it. Dr Ashton asked the Matron if she had not received an order from the night nurse to prepare the patient. She had not. He said he had instructed Nurse Fuss to do so for 11 o’clock. Nurse Fuss subsequently said she had received no such orders. Dr Ashton told the witness the staff was not sufficient and Matron said by the Board’s orders she had tried to get help and could not. Dr Ashton said that was not his affair whether the staff was sufficient or not, if anything happened he would refuse to give a death certificate and would report the matter to the coroner.

It would be an advantage to hospital administration if all orders for operations were given to me. There were not always consultations before operations. In most hospitals certain days and hours are recognised for operations: in Burra the hour was determined by the operator’s convenience except in emergencies, and not by the necessity of the patient, or the convenience of the staff. It would be easier if there were a recognised rule and the lack of such caused all the friction so far as I am concerned. The doctors used to make it a point to visit daily at meal hours. She asked the doctor not to go into the ward at meal times and the reply was ‘it suited him and he would do so’.

Mr A.J. McBride, Chairman of the Board, submitted the minutes and other documents and said he believed the trouble was largely due to the Board’s desire to control admissions. Mr Hawkes was the first to object to their having sole control and the regulation fell into disuse. As far as memory served the alleged discourtesy to Dr Steele occurred 12-18 months after the Nurse Mosey case. In the context of the occasion Mr Warnes had appealed to the Chairman re the doctor’s power to intervene and the Chairman had said to the doctor ‘You mind your own business.’ But it had been neither intended nor taken as an insult.

Dr Ashton had been given the reason ‘disregarding instructions’ as the reason for his dismissal.

He was appointed Honorary Surgeon because a father of a boy patient wanted him to operate on the boy. Dr Ashton still had the power of sending anyone to the hospital. He had not acknowledged the letter appointing him Honorary Surgeon.

In operations he thought the interests of patients and staff should be considered before the convenience of the operator. The causes of the trouble were: the hours of operating, the method of giving instructions, the refusal to attend Board meetings and the method of admitting patients. Many patients treated as ‘poor’ by the hospital and not made to pay, had been charged by the doctors. A man named Honeychurch, a poor farmer of Baldina, was charge 25/- per week for 11 weeks’ nursing medicine etc. (£25-5-0) and Dr Ashton charged him £34 for the operation. Under the rules as Dr Ashton was a paid officer he thought the hospital could have charged the patient a fair thing for the operation, but that was not contemplated.

[Two other examples of Dr Ashton’s charging poor patients are cited.]

Dr Smith queried whether Dr Ashton could legally claim such fees when he was an employee of the hospital. Mr McBride thought he could not.

Matron Mildred was recalled and further questioned re the 11 a.m. operation called when staff were unavailable. It was postponed for about two days. ‘I did not go into the theatre because of friction between myself and Dr Ashton’. She was questioned on appendix cases and the need to disinfect the theatre after septic appendix cases.

Mr Mitchell found the evidence amazing: ‘it looked as though the doctor wanted to operate on another patient before the theatre had been disinfected after a septic case.’

Mr Crewes. Dr Smith asked Mr Crewes: ‘You think that the doctor should have the power to do as he likes in regard to hours, upset the meal times of the nurses and the arrangements of the hospital generally?’ Crewes said: Yes for cases of urgency.

Mr Crewes considered his position of Mayor and member of the Board produced a conflict of interest and he wished to say as little as possible. He did consider that in the case of Dr Ashton alleging he could not get his orders carried out no finality could be arrived at in the enquiry because Dr Ashton refused to attend any meeting.

‘In my opinion he was very foolish not to attend.’

Dr Smith asked that if all the trouble results from Dr Ashton’s foolishness what should be done.

Mr Crewes was not passing judgement, but if the Board had lost the confidence of the people it should resign.

Dr Smith asked: On the other hand if a paid employee of a Board refuses to do his duty, whose duty is it to resign?

Crewes: There is only one thing to do, pass him out.

Dr Smith: Did you satisfy yourself that Dr Ashton had refused to carry out the written instructions of the Board?

Crewes: I felt the time was inopportune for dismissal and fought unsuccessfully for deferral until another letter had been written asking him to attend.

Mr Mitchell: Several letters had been written by the Board and Dr Ashton had been interviewed and he would not do as requested. How long do you think the patience of an employer should hang out?

Dr Smith: Do you know that the ex-officio appointment of the Mayor of Burra as a member of the Board is illegal under the Act?

Mr Crewes: No.

Nurse Fuss said she was temporarily acting as night nurse on the occasion when Dr Ashton alleged he had given orders for a patient to be prepared for an operation at 11 a.m. Dr Ashton had given her no such order.

Mr I.J. Warnes said he had brought the account sent by Dr Ashton to Miss Store to the notice of the Board. It had been said he obtained the lawyer’s letter demanding payment by unfair means. It had been handed to him by another member whom he understood to have got it by fair means.

Subsequent statements by Dr Ashton had shed a different light upon the case.

The enquiry was adjourned.

Characteristics of the 1917 paper.

Page 1.

Large advertisements: mostly local.

Page 2.

A few larger advertisements in columns 1-2, then notices, small advertisements, classifieds and the beginning of news. Rarely any editorial.

Page 3.

The news continues with a few larger local advertisements.

War news, mainly about ‘Our Boys’ and patriotic efforts at home dominate the paper.

The Town & District Roll of Honour is printed most weeks.

Page 4.

A mixture of smaller advertisements for local businesses, patent medicines etc.

Several columns of news and articles. The latter are of a more general, as opposed to local, interest. Often they relate to patriotic matters, the recruiting drive and pro-conscription propaganda.

Letters from the front or from those on leave or in hospital were common on pages 3 and 4.

This year there was little sporting activity to report for obvious reasons, and not much reporting of the little that did take place. Patriotic activities dominated all else.

Paper was hard to get and there were few supplements as a result.

Paper quality was not good, but better than might be expected and the paper itself is not as brittle as the literary supplement for 1916. Only two of the literary supplements for 1917 are preserved in the hard copy.

Numbering of issues in 1917

There appeared to be another attempt to get the numbering of volumes and issues on a more rational basis with a new volume and new series for the issues at the start of 1917.

The year began with Volume XXXIX Number 1 on 3 January 1917.

And continued to Volume XXXIX Number 52 on 26 December 1917.

Edward Wall (151⁄2) & Alfred Jones (12) and Harold Arthur Harrison (14 yr 9 months) were charged with maliciously damaging property at Burra Showgrounds on 13 January to the value of £1. Jones and Harrison were also charged with writing an indecent word on the grandstand, totalizator room & refreshment room.

George Hann, Secretary of the Burra Racing Club reported it. The words were fortunately in whitewash and relatively easily removed.

M-C McCarthy said these three were merely imitating the actions of older lads of whom he was on the track.

Mrs Jones pleaded she was the mother of 14 and this was the first offender and he would promise not to re-offend. She had one son at the front and one had given his life.

Mr Harrison also undertook to closely supervise his son in future – he had been working for his father for six months.

Mr W. Carpenter spoke for Wall whose mother was a widow.

Mr Crewes imposed a fine of £1 each, damages of £1 each plus costs.

On the second charge Harrison & Jones were fined 5/- each plus costs.

They would face the reformatory on default or if they re-offend.

Fire.

On Monday a large grass fire started on A.G. Gebhardt’s property at Mt Bryan in the paddock known as Develaing’s to the east of the railway on part of Boolcunda Station. The origin is unknown. Help soon rushed to the site and fighters were helped by the lack of wind. The fire ran through both A.G. & L.W. Gebhardt’s and into Mt Cone – O.R. Robinson’s and thence towards James Reed’s Wandillah. 500 acres of this was burnt to check the oncoming flames. After midday the wind rose, but by 4 p.m. the fire fighters had it contained to the edges of a creek when a whirlwind spread it to another 4,000 acres of splendid feed. Control was established about 8 p.m. It was about 6 miles east of Burra and every available man had gone. Miss Clarice Reed worked tirelessly on horseback moving sheep from the line of fire and wasn’t out of the saddle till 10 p.m. except to change horses. A.G. Gebhardt has lost almost all feed on the run and with W.L. Gebhardt has seen about 6,500 acres of feed burnt. Mr R.O. Robinson’s [sic] Mt Cone loss is c. 800 acres and Mr R.M. Hawker’s c. 50 & James Reed c. 1,000. It is believed not more than 12 sheep were lost and the fire moved too rapidly to burn fences.

Dr Ashton’s response to the Board of Enquiry runs to almost three columns.

He blames the ‘new element’ on the Board for the trouble and brands the Enquiry a whitewash of the Board. To say he is the cause is to confuse cause and effect. He draws attention to the way hospital finances improved after he arrived towards the end of 1910.

Income from subscriptions and free gifts 1909 £371

£242

£376

£660

£645

£726

£388

(In 1915 an accounting change meant this figure was for six months only.)

£702

Dr Ashton was excluded from 5 August 1917 and the present unsatisfactory state of finances hardly indicates the brilliance of the ‘new element’.

Dr Ashton gave no evidence to the enquiry because on the day the Premier heard the Board’s side of the story he was served with a writ and so he declined to attend.

Ashton’s response to allegation (a) is confused, or at least confusing.

To allegation (b) he says he personally heard the offensive remark to Dr Steele who expressed his disgust.

Of allegation (c) re written instructions to staff he says the findings are irrelevant and merely camouflage hostility and discrimination to Dr Ashton.

On allegation (d), that the Hospital Board refused to admit cases, the finding flies in the face of facts and is inconsistent. In the time of the Riese case there were 30 patients, some delirious, and five nurses and there was a refusal to get more staff. In the later situation with only 11 cases and those chronic and convalescent, admission to all but emergency cases was denied. The hospital contains 35 beds.

With respect to the allegation (e) concerning the hours of operations, Ashton essentially denied the allegation and claimed operations were at reasonable hours.

Allegation (f) was covered under (c).

Allegation (g), that he requested an operation before the theatre was fumigated, was a fabrication.

As for allegation (h) alleging personal animosity, that is clear from his being excluded from the hospital and then offered Honorary Surgeon’s rights. Honorary Surgeons are not allowed to charge fees.

In allegation (i) the Board disregarded long established custom at the hospital allowing private fees to be charged: a custom followed by the other practitioner and acknowledged by the Inspector-General.

Allegation (j) accused Ashton of overcharging Miss Stone & Mr Honeychurch. Ashton includes a letter from Mr P. Honeychurch disclaiming any complaint about charges and similarly from E.J. Villis and another disclaimer to which no name is attached, but the sum involved suggests Miss Stone.

Allegation (l) suggested he left the hospital without a medical man to conduct operations, but the resolution of the Hospital Board reported in the Record of 17 October 1917 refutes the finding.

With respect to allegation (o): if there was no need for patients to go elsewhere why have patients other than Ashton’s chosen to do so?

As for the allegation concerning the instruction to Nurse Fuss – Ashton says he has a witness who heard him give the intimation first over the phone to the probationer and later on, the order to the nurse.

‘I certainly hold the view “that the Hospital should exist for the convenience of all sorts of sick people” and fail to see why I should be censured for maintaining that view against recent innovation.’

Essentially Ashton shows that he held the view that he had been victimised and singled out unfairly and treated very unprofessionally.

XXXX, 4, 30 Jan. 1918, Supplement

Burra Hospital Board of Enquiry.

[As explained in Dr Ashton’s letter, the enquiry reached its conclusions without hearing from him.]

[The conclusions of the Board were very strongly against Dr Ashton, but it also found that the Hospital Board was at fault in allowing the situation to develop and in not acting firmly early. Practices that had developed over many years were inappropriate and the Board should have known that and acted. A thorough revision of hospital rules was required.]

Findings on allegations against the Hospital Board

The Board was justified in passing a resolution on 15 August 1915 declaring Dr Ashton’s accusation of neglect by nursing staff in the Riese case unfair.

The Board was justified in not granting leave of absence to Nurse Mosey, as the course she wished to take could be of no benefit to the hospital. The insult alleged to have been made to Dr Steele was in circumstances now unclear and if it occurred does not seem intentional and did not appear to make him specially aggrieved.

Under the circumstances of the time the Board was justified in asking Dr Ashton for written instructions, if that was taken to apply to orders concerning operations. [Though the enquiry admitted that the definition of ‘instructions’ was not clear.]

Concerning advising Dr Ashton on 16 June 1917 that only emergencies were to be admitted, that was also justified in the circumstances.

In supporting the desire of the hospital matron to have hours for operations fixed, the Board was not unreasonable.

The resolution of 5 July 1917 terminating Dr Ashton’s appointment as a medical officer ‘was proper in the circumstances’.

There was no evidence that a nurse revised or countermanded a surgeon’s instructions about an operation. [They added that to have carried out the operation at the time requested would have been unsafe.]

There is no evidence of personal animosity to Dr Ashton, or of a desire to strip him of remuneration.

The Board did not find ‘in the constitution of the hospital or in any agreement with the medical officer of the hospital that Dr Ashton possessed any right to charge for operations on his own patients at the hospital, such patients paying the ordinary hospital charges’.

[While this finding is no doubt true in a legalistic sense, this finding would certainly appear to fly in the face of long established custom and certainly it was not only Dr Ashton who was involved. Dr Ashton says in his letter that he was told when he came to the town in 1910, by the Chairman of the Hospital Board ‘doctors could charge private patients fees just as if they were in their own homes.]

The evidence shows that Dr Ashton charged a non-fee paying patient for attendance on her while she was a patient at the hospital.

[The statement by the patient included in Dr Ashton’s letter, while not making things quite clear on this, does raise doubts about this allegation. She says the £17 was ‘for private and hospital attendance together’. She was never told the £17 was for hospital attendance alone. She further says she was never asked to pay the bill after explaining the circumstances.]

There is no evidence of the Board seeking to humiliate medical officers.

Evidence shows the hospital was never left without a medical man to conduct operations.

There is no evidence to show that the appointment of Mr P.A. McBride to the Board was unsuitable. [The objections by some at the time had been on the grounds that he was rather young and that his appointment gave the McBride family too many connections on the Board either by blood or marriage.]

There is no evidence that the Board did anything to discourage subscriptions.

There was no need for patients to be sent out of town for treatment as a result of the way the Board treated Dr Ashton.

The Board was not responsible for people travelling elsewhere for treatment (often in unfit conditions for travel).

There is no evidence the Board charged excessive fees. The Board is not responsible for Dr Ashton’s refusal to work at the hospital.

Meetings of the Board are open to the public.

The Board is not responsible for gathering sufficient patients to satisfy standards set for training probationers.

Findings on allegations made by the Hospital Board

See general conclusions. [Essentially confirming that it is doing its duties.]

[That legitimate uses of the hospital are being abused by medical officers.] See general conclusions.

The assertion that contributions fees and gifts have risen since 1909 is true only if the amount subscribed for equipment is taken into account.

Dr Ashton did refuse to attend Board meetings and Dr Williams attended sometimes and apparently is now regular in his attendance.

The resolution of the Board concerning the complaints about the treatment of the enteric patient Riese was justified and Dr Ashton made no complaint about it for over two years and then it was not a bona fide objection.

See b) above.

Dr Williams is a gentleman of equal standing with Dr Ashton.

Dr Ashton was not considerate to the staff regarding times of operations and visiting hours and was disrespectful to the matron.

Nurse Mosey’s application for leave was dealt with properly.

The hospital has always been available for patients.

There are at least 35 beds available.

The Board has no reason to doubt the evidence of Nurse Fuss that she received no orders for preparations to be made for an operation on a patient named Rogers.

[Nurse Fuss was B.M. Fuss.]

General Conclusions

The Hospital Board and nursing staff have done their duty under difficult circumstances: ‘had it not been for certain actions of Dr Ashton, the circumstances which necessitated the holding of this enquiry could not have arisen.

The trouble has originated and came to a crisis in connection with.

admission of patients

attendance of Medical Officers at Board Meetings

the Board’s desire, conveyed to Dr Ashton re giving orders

hours of Medical Officers’ visits

arrangements regarding operations

The hospital was established as a public hospital for the purpose of

treating the sick poor

emergency cases

cases which for special reasons needed hospital treatment

Sources of income are:

Government Subsidy

voluntary contributions

payments made by patients for maintenance and treatment

Over time all sorts of people were admitted irrespective of social and financial circumstances on the medical practitioners’ orders – Members of Friendly Societies, persons with infectious diseases and well-to-do patients were admitted irrespective of provisions that existed for treatment and expense of such patients under friendly society rules, provisions of the Health Act or individual financial ability. ‘The view of the Medical Officers seems to have been that the hospital existed for the convenience of all sorts of sick people.’

These views led to abuses which became more complicated with the possibility of personal gain on the part of doctors. For instance Dr Ashton was MO for certain friendly societies as well as MO at the hospital and drew pay in each capacity by sending to hospital patients to whom he was obliged to give medical attendance and medicines at their homes. There is also evidence that poor patients in hospital, judged unable to pay, have still been charged for medical attendance by the MO.

About 5 years ago the Board believed Mos were admitting patients improperly and that if Mos admitted patients they were paid to attend at the patient’s home there was a way of transferring cost to the hospital. On 12 December 1912 the Board passed a resolution regarding hospital admissions which worked for some months. Had they found out the actual state of affairs and dealt with it this Board of Enquiry believes there would have been no further trouble.

Some Board members saw this as a want of confidence in the doctors and a personal slight on them and an attempt to lessen their powers. Private matters and personal feelings may have obscured the real issue.

Misunderstandings followed re the Board’s aims and attitude and this seems to have influenced Dr Ashton in the way he carried out or refused to carry out his duties. He refused to attend Board meetings, took exception to a request to place his instructions in writing, he fixed operations times that gave maximum disturbance to hospital routines and made visits commonly at meal times. He was removed from office as MO, on the grounds that he disregarded the Board’s instructions, on 5 July 1917.

Recommendations

Hospital rules should be revised to:

bring them within the terms of the Act of Parliament

regulate the admission of patients

establish a proper routine of hours for ward visits, operations and other necessary matters

Admission of members of friendly societies and those with infectious diseases should be made only under arrangements with the societies and Local Boards of Health respectively.

Only persons unable to pay for attendance should be admitted free of charge – except for emergencies and accidents where the Board should consider each patient’s circumstances.

The duties and responsibilities of the Inspector-General of Hospitals need proper definition.

The Government should consider appointing a medical practitioner as Government MO at the hospital at a reasonable salary with the right of private practice.

J.V. Lord writes from Oakvale Station re the huge fire then raging. He understands the fire extends from near Wentworth right through the north to Buckalow and Netley boundary and from Popalta Station to Oakvale – an area about 70 miles wide by 100 miles long. So far we have kept the fire off Oakvale, but it fronts the whole eastern boundary (about 20 miles long) – in places quite close and in others distant. Wind is the real threat. We have had a fire on the southern boundary 28 miles long, which was held with great difficulty. Postmark Station lost much grass. This fire is now going south towards Morgan vale & part of Pine Valley, but we expect to hold it at the Morgan vale boundary. 13 points of rain last night have checked, but nor extinguished it.

Burra Town Council.

Advice from the Hon. Foster is that the permission of the Federal Treasurer is needed to get a loan for an electricity scheme. This is unlikely unless it can be raised locally. The Municipal Assoc. gave contrary advice.

Peterborough advised that the cost of their scheme was £10,000 and charge 10d a unit for light and 6d a unit for power. Strathalbyn’s plant cost £5,500 including batteries. Light is charged at 8d a unit and powers at 6d. There are 102 consumers. Both schemes are said to be satisfactory.

Miss Bubb replied to Mr Halls’ recent allegations. She denies letting him know at the last minute – he is not on the phone and the Reformatory is distant. The Exchange Hotel is phoned in the morning and a message is left for him on his return from the morning train, or an officer intercepts him on a trip to or from the earlier train.

E. Schutze applies to be lamplighter at 9/- a day.

Tar-dressing of Market Square was discussed as outlined above.

The Electric Light Scheme:

The Mayor said the scheme suggested had no accumulators. The firm alleged the batteries would cost £1,400 and last only 7 years.

Cr McBride said the estimates were absurd. Fuel was estimated at £60 p.a. – the engine at the Burra Mine cost 30/- a day to run. Salaries at £180 p.a. were also much too low as was the cost of the dynamo at £150.

Cr Radford said they had allowed for only a few hours running in the evening.

It was resolved to write to the firm for an explanation of their fuel price (given that wood in £1 a ton) and of the wages and oil costs. They would also say that the Council would not entertain a scheme that did not include a battery.

Cr McBride will get an engineer’s evaluation.

Mr O’Halloran said the party was against property qualifications for the Legislative Council and was for that chamber’s abolition. They were in favour of reducing the House of Assembly to seven electorates with three members each – a reduction of over 50%. Farmers and labourers were not receiving true value for their labour. There had been profiteering on kerosene in the war years. The party believed in equal opportunity, education for all and equal wages for men and women.

Mr Buxton was an anticonscriptionist. The prosperity of farmers and labour was intertwined. Exploitative middlemen were the bane of farmers and workers.

Mr Willcott spoke for the 1⁄2d tax on land on unimproved values and in favour of the bulk handling of wheat. He was in favour of irrigated land for returned soldiers and the party aimed to raise £22 million for repatriation purposes.

Re-opening of the Leighton School. I.J. Warnes re-opened the school on Tuesday 11 March. E.W. Crewes also attended with J.Q. Hogan, Chairman of the Booborowie School Board and M.A. Radford as a representative of the Burra School Board. The school building has been enlarged and lighting and ventilation improved.

Mr Warnes said the first school had been held in the old Wesleyan Chapel and in 1878 the first school had been built. During the alterations school had carried on in Leighton Hall. Wartime problems with labour and materials had delayed the project, which had begun in November 1917. The 40 pupils certainly deserved better than the old cramped, badly lit and poorly ventilated room. There had been a move to build a new school at Blacksmith’s Corner and a second one by the creek, but this was no time to be building new schools – perhaps in better times.

A.D. McDonald then explained that the Government had contributed £75 and expected the rest to be found by parents, but in fact Mr Warnes had taken over the balance himself.

Messrs J.Q. Hogan, E. Cock, M.A. Radford, E.W. Crewes and Robinson (the head teacher), all spoke. Mr Warnes was warmly thanked.

State Election. Report in 31⁄2 columns of the Farmers & Settlers’ Candidates in Burra.

Mr Pick spent his speech outlining his split from the Liberal Union and in running down the latter, though not without interruptions from time to time from Mr McDonald.

Mr O’Loughlin spoke in favour of the Todd River Scheme on Eyre Peninsula, attacked the Vaughan Government, opposed proposals for a deep water port at Pt Victor and strongly supported the Repurchase Act of 1897 to see large estates cut up for farming. He did not believe in fewer MPs.

Mr Mills spoke passionately about the problems of new settlers faced with land tax and with hordes of rabbits from Crown Land. The Farmers & Settlers’ Assoc. had stopped bulk handling from being introduced – it would have cost millions and taken 10 years to complete. Instead they had gone for shelter sheds for grain – though the Government had been slow to erect them. He was for better educational facilities in country areas and a whole list of other measures to assist farmers. He was for the developmental railways on Eyre Peninsula and for the Todd River Scheme – it would be necessary to provide land for returning soldiers.

Correspondence with the Railway commissioner re the restoration of the Saturday night train continues.

Enquiries re possible electric light schemes also continue. Mr Christie of Messrs Christie & Gardner was present re their electric light proposal.

The main question was whether it was better to have a large and small generator or a large generator and storage battery. Mr Christie said in theory a small town should be better off with a battery because it enabled continuous service without having to run an engine continuously, BUT a battery cost c. £1,000 and because it was impossible to get engineers who understood them well its average life was not over 5 years. Their firm would therefore recommend one engine of 100 h.p. for the heavy evening load until about 11.30 p.m. and a small automatic 15 h.p. engine to carry the load from 11.30 p.m. to daylight. This could run for six hours without needing attention. When told that Jamestown would not be without its battery he said their experience was only of 12 months and a battery would be good for a year or two. The best one he knew was at Numurkah in Victoria, which with extraordinary care had lasted 61⁄2 years and might go another six months. With a battery a 70 h.p. engine would do. If they went for the automatic set option they would need to have a boy on the premises when it operated. He would send them an estimate of the relative costs of the alternatives over 5 years.

The Hydraulic Engineer will be asked about the possibility of using electricity to pump the town’s water and the railways will also be approached about their usage.

Burra Show Society. AGM 30 March.

The President, I.J. Warnes, took the chair.

He reported on the impact of the war on the district – mainly with respect to volunteers for the front.

The season had been generally splendid, though somewhat varied due to the mice plague which affected both the sown seed and the bagged wheat awaiting transport. Pastoral interests had a good year with a heavy lambing and good prices and feed is currently good with good prospects for the next season. In fact everything was good except for an increase in the blow-fly problem.

Membership was stable.

The Sheep Show was cancelled due to heavy rainfall at the time it was scheduled and creeks made it impossible to move stock.

The Dog Trials were a great success.

The Show on 24 October was an unqualified success and gate money was up again.

The luncheon provided by the ladies was especially helpful in making the show a success.

They began and ended with a credit balance of £75.

Elected were

Burra Hospital Board.

Nurse [B.M.] Fuss resigned as charge-nurse. Accepted.

The Chief Secretary asked for any comments on the Board of Enquiry findings. The Board was quite happy to regulate the admission of patients and to establish a proper routine of hours for ward visits, operations and other necessary matters.

The recommendation that the rules be brought into line with the Act of Parliament was acceptable as far as not permitting the Mayor to be an ex-officio member of the Board was concerned, but not acceptable as far as refusing paying patients was concerned.

Mr Radford moved that the Board objected to the exclusion of paying patients and to the exclusion of the Mayor being an ex-officio member.

Mr Crewes 2nd Mr Radford’s amendment, saying the Chief Secretary of the time said he intended extending the concession to all towns with hospitals.

Mr Winnall said he would be agreeable to making a suggestion that the Mayor be appointed every time, but not that it be imperative.

Mr Crewes thought a change of Government could mean fighting the whole issue over again.

Mr Dane supported Mr Radford’s amendment.

Mr McLaren said as the hospital was vested in the Corporation, provision for a representative should have been made in the trust deed.

Mr McLaren said he was not appointed as Mayor.

Mr Radford said the Council had thought that he was and it was therefore surprised when he continued in the position.

The amendment was carried on the casting vote of the chairman, Mr A.J. McBride.

The Board agreed that Friendly Soc. members and infectious disease patients should only be admitted under arrangements made with such societies and the Local Board of Health and only patients unable to pay be admitted free of charge and in emergency and accident cases the board should consider each patient’s circumstances.

The Board thought the appointment of a medical practitioner as a salaried Government Medical Officer was inappropriate in the absence of Dr Steele.

Children’s Patriotic Demonstration, 13 April, in aid of the Red Cross.

The effort reflected great credit on Mr R.T. Hitchcox, Headmaster of Burra School, Mr Biddle, Master of the High School and the teaching staff. The day began with a basketball match between two teams of Burra girls.

Then there was a procession of about 50 pets.

The Boy Scouts then staged a demonstration.

They were followed by physical drill by the High School boys and girls, with the Girls’ Fife & Drum Band.

Organised games came next.

A party of returned soldiers from Springbank Estate provided songs.

Stalls comprised afternoon tea, sweets, plain goods, fruit & nuts; guess the weight of a pumpkin (89 lb). A kookaburra and a basket of dahlias were auctioned. Buttons were sold.

All in all £130 was raised including £25 worth of buttons sold on 2 April (to the Children’s Patriotic Fund.)

Burra Cheer-up Soc.

There was a farewell social on 12 April for Pte Elliott, Pte Penns and Tpr W. Hopkins.

Burra Town Council, Monday.

Christie & Gardner advise that an auxiliary electric plant would cost £131 p.a.

A battery would cost (assuming a life of six years) £400 p.a. including interest and depreciation.

Henry Roach & Sons said they couldn’t say if they would use electricity until they knew its cost.

Drew & Crewes would use electric light.

The mayor said they had not yet sufficient information to lay before ratepayers to justify calling a meeting about electric light.

Cr Radford thought that the cost would be 30% more than in normal times and therefore it would be silly to call a meeting.

The Mayor wondered if people were prepared to wait seven years or so until things got back to normal – even if the war ended tomorrow it would take years to return to normal. He favoured going to the ratepayers.

Plans and specifications would cost £150 and before spending that it was necessary to know that ratepayers would not turn it down. One problem about the scheme’s viability was the number of private plants that would be installed if delay went on.

Cr Dane moved that the Town Clerk write to Christie & Gardner saying that if they were prepared to run the scheme at their own risk for two years as stated by Mr Christie whilst in Burra, the Burra Council would do its best to carry out the scheme.

Carried with Cr Killicoat opposed. He favoured getting other opinions. He believed the proposed scheme was unreasonable. He thought the costings for labour were absurd.

B. Bourman has been appointed lamplighter.

L.H. Foote writes re open gates at ‘The Gums’. He asserts that the only gates left open were gates found open. He gave the names of the alleged road hogs as L.H. Foote, H. Austin & B. Burgess and claims the reward offered for supplying the names.

Obituary. Jane Berryman, widow of the late Richard Berryman died 18 April at her residence in Kooringa aged 95. She is survived by three sons, five daughters, 35 grandchildren and 43 great grandchildren.

The late Mrs Jane Berryman was born at St Boeague Cornwall, 7 August 1822, the youngest daughter of Mr & Mrs Thomas Pellew. Soon after her marriage the couple left England in the Peakingham and landed in SA 22 March 1849, coming directly to Burra. After a time Mr Berryman took up land at Springbank where they lived until his death in 1895. Mrs Berryman then moved to ‘Springbank’ Mt Pleasant. A few months ago she fell and broke a small bone in her hip, but she had recovered from that and was able to get about again. She was a long time member of the Bible Christian Church and had a family of 10, 8 of whom survive: T. (Yongala), John (Kooringa), William (NSW), Mesdames J. Russell (Hallett), D.T. Robinson (Mannanarie), J.T. Walker (Adelaide), M.M. Bert (Adelaide) & Miss Berryman (Kooringa). There are 35 grandchildren & 45 great grandchildren.

Editorial on: The Burra Hospital.

The Board is wrestling with the problem of the reduction in Government subsidy. In the 12 years to 1915 the upkeep was £18,000 and only £900 or 5% came from paying patients and donations. Recent experience suggests that many of the patients knew a good thing when they saw it and were actually in a position to pay, which was surely unfair to those who did pay. The difficulty is to get those who can afford it to pay while [not?] depriving the needy of free access. At present the scheme most in favour is to supply each member of the Board with admission tickets. A person who needs admission and is unable to pay, or can only pay part, will explain this to one member of the Board, who can then issue an admission ticket. This would not prevent immediate admission to urgent cases without question.

Mr Richard Thomas will be 80 on 25 April.

The Burra Sporting & Athletic Club is forwarding a welcoming wallet to: Lieut. Chester Sandland, & Ptes J. Williams, E. Dollard & Leslie Harris.

Obituary & Inquest. Booborowie Tragedy.

On Saturday last William Jeffery shot his son Arthur and then himself in a fit of temporary insanity. There was no known immediate cause, though he seems to have been much worried by the war. He lost a brother and son-in-law at the front and has a son there. His son Arthur was aged 27.

I.J. Warnes JP was the coroner at the inquest on the body of Arthur Jeffery.

Samuel Jeffery identified the body of Arthur Albert Jeffery.

Jane Elizabeth Jeffery, mother of the deceased, said her husband had driven their daughter to the train at 4.20 a.m. and returned home about 1.20 p.m. He had been cheerful and bright on leaving. On reaching home he went to the front room and when asked what time he had got to the train he had replied that he would shoot himself and his wife too. His wife had hidden in the chaff shed after telling Arthur what had been said. Her small daughter had come to her and told her that William Jeffery had shot Arthur and then himself. When she emerged Arthur shook his head, but didn’t speak to her and her little boy went for Mr Bertlesmier.

Eileen Jeffery aged 13 described seeing the shooting and then telling her mother.

Alfred Victor Jeffery also saw the incident and said that after he was shot Arthur had told him to go to get Mr Bertlesmier.

Fred. C. Baldock, farmer of Booborowie, had seen Jeffery in Burra and was with him about half an hour. He had commented unfavourably on Baldock’s driving a German wagon and said his son was going out with a German girl and he didn’t like it. They had two glasses of beer together and Jeffery appeared to be quite sober.

M-C North described finding the bodies of father and son.

Dr Wilson, acting for Dr Williams, described the injuries.

The verdict was that A.A. Jeffery was killed by a gunshot fired by his father.

At the inquest on the body of William Jeffery it was revealed that he had been sunstruck when Arthur was a baby and since then he was very irritable and had at times shown signs of insanity. There was a sister in the mental home.

The verdict was that he had shot himself while temporarily insane.

Mr Virgo CBE Empire Secretary of the YMCA addressed a large audience at the Institute on Sunday afternoon. Donations and promises totalled £313, besides a collection. Mr & Mrs J.M. McBride gave £100 each.

The Burra Institute Committee has for some time been considering enlarging the hall and negotiations are proceeding.

The editor commented that the increased size was needed only occasionally and a new piano was a more urgent requirement.

A Bolt. Clem Pearce was crossing the creek at the old White Hart Hotel ford when part of a load of loose timber moved and touched the horse which bolted, throwing Mr Pearce and some of the load into the creek. The horse went around the corner into Morehead Street and then turned left at Fuss Bros. and went up the hill towards the reservoir, past Winnall’s house and was coming down the hill when the reins got tangled in a wheel and pulled the horse up suddenly, pulling it down and capsizing the dray. In the outcome the only real damage was a broken rein.

Burra Town Council.

Christie & Gardner have agreed to stand by their scheme and guarantee the Council against loss for two years as long as they are appointed consultant engineers. They would appoint the engineers in charge of the plant and the Council would follow their directions concerning the working of the plant.

The Railway Commissioner needs more details before agreeing to use electricity.

The Hydraulic Engineer would need to be convinced that electricity was cheaper before going over to its use.

Further advice was given by Clutterbuck Bros. against small cheap plants, which they said had always failed.

After discussion the Mayor said something had to be done: either adoption of the scheme or it had to be turned down.

Cr Radford was against paying wartime inflated prices.

Mr Crewes thought it would be at least seven years before normal times returned.

Cr McBride wanted it put to the ratepayers. As far as he could see there would be 20 streetlights at a cost of £6,000 and some convenience to consumers. There would be interest and depreciation and operating costs of £1,400 per year and therefore a considerable loss.

The Mayor said that wrote off the plant in ten years: not a fair estimate.

The Mayor was for getting a decision from the ratepayers.

Cr Radford would resign if they (the ratepayers) decided to go on with the scheme.

Cr McBride would try to make a success if it if the ratepayers wanted it. [But he was clearly opposed personally.] He moved for a ratepayers’ meeting. Carried.

The Saturday night train will run through to Broken Hill from the introduction of the winter timetable.

[Cr Greenwood for East Ward wanted a hole filled in Kuchenmeister’s Creek – is that the creek running past Kuchenmeister’s slaughterhouse to the cemetery?]

The issue of Mr McLaren’s appointment to the Hospital Board was raised by Cr Killicoat. The Town Clerk said that in 1912 the Chief Secretary had been asked that ‘His Worship the Mayor, Mr John McLaren, be appointed a member of the Board’. The Chief Secretary in reply wrote that ‘His Excellency the Governor has been pleased to appoint John McLaren, Esq., Mayor of Burra to be a member of the Board for that year’.

Cr McBride said McLaren was Mayor, but had been personally appointed.

Cr Killicoat asked why the Council had intervened and nominated a candidate if not to get a representative on the Board: they did not write when other vacancies occurred.

Mr Crewes said it had at the time been distinctly understood that it was ‘The Mayor’ who was appointed.

Cr McBride dissented and the matter dropped.

Burra Hospital Board.

Residents have been complaining of a bad smell from the hospital drainage and steps had been taken to remedy it.

Patient numbers for May were c. 4.

The Staff comprised Matron, a not-yet-qualified nurse, 3 probationers, a laundress, a cook, a wards-maid and a porter.

Mr Crewes doubted that this reflected efficiency.

Mr Warnes said the hospital was equipped for 30 and had to be maintained in case of an outbreak of disease.

Mr Crewes wondered if a special nurse for isolation was warranted under the circumstances.

The Chairman said that with no charge-nurse it was necessary.

Mr Crewes: but in spite of the numbers we are trying to get a charge-nurse at £80 p.a. He moved that the cost of the upkeep of the institution be considered.

Mr Warnes said the 3 probationers got 32/6 a month, so could hardly be reduced in pay or numbers. The Matron and porter got £100 p.a. each, which was little enough. The trouble was the shortage of patients.

Dr Williams was to be complimented on the work he had done to keep serious operations coming in. If townspeople were not going to support the hospital possibly the doors would be closed. Mr Warnes denied any extravagance.

Mr Radford said that without a charge-nurse the Matron was on duty practically 24 hours a day, as there was no other qualified nurse. She could not be asked to continue on those lines.

One probationer wanted to leave.

The Chairman said in his opinion if the townspeople did not support the hospital it must be closed. Some had gone to Adelaide, told a tale of woe and been admitted as paupers. As a result of such abuse Adelaide hospitals were full. The Inspector-General intended to force such people to be treated locally unless a very good reason could be shown.

Burra Show Soc. 7 May.

Proposals for new membership charges were discussed.

Mr T. McWaters proposed there be:

Traffic was stopped and a vast concourse of people attended. The Band played several selections. Mr Crewes appealed for funds after each selection. After an adjournment for afternoon tea there was a final selection and a last appeal. A cockatoo was auctioned. They had to catch the 4.50 p.m. train for Burra. The weather was dull, but perfect.

The Electricity Scheme.

There was a poor attendance at the ratepayers’ meeting on Monday. The Mayor was disappointed at the turnout. Some years ago a £2,300 scheme had been turned down and just as well it was. Over recent years we have raised £2,000 in a day; surely we should be able to raise £5,000 to £6,000 for a paying proposition. The mayor read the scheme of Christie & Gardner – estimating 130 consumers for light the capital cost would be c. £4,800 with a charge of 8d per unit for light and 4d per unit for power. Revenue was anticipated to be £916 in the first year, £1,066 in the second and £1,283 in the third including street lighting. Working costs for the three years were estimated at £270, £465 & £485. There would be no battery, but an auxiliary plant. They would guarantee the Council against loss for two years. The street lights at present, miserable as they were, cost £170 p.a.

Mr Winnall asked if all Councillors were in favour. Cr Radford was not. Cr McWaters was undecided; Cr McBride was for electricity, but against this scheme. Cr Dane would vote for it as a ratepayer, but as a Councillor he wanted more information. Mr Turner had offered plans and specifications free. Christie & Gardner wanted £150. They had plants in 30 towns in Victoria which spoke for their bona fides.

Cr McBride said Jamestown’s experience was cautionary. With 247 consumers they had outgoings of £1,779 and an income of £900 and electricity only from 6 p.m. to 11.30 p.m.

Kadina had an income of £1,176, a fuel bill of £750 a year plus interest and a sinking fund on about £10,000.

Mr Winnall moved that there was insufficient information to grant approval. He said the figures made it impossible to see how a profit could be made in light of evidence from other towns.

Cr Radford 2nd saying the costs seemed greatly underestimated. Carried & meeting adjourned.

Burra Cheer-up Soc. AGM was held 28 May with E.W. Crewes presiding.

This year there were only 20 socials for soldiers and most of these were welcome home socials. Only 47 Cheer-up parcels were given out this year and five nurses received fountain pens: sisters Hatherly, Roach, Armstrong, McWaters & Morris.

We have sent Lady Brown 99 pairs of socks and various other articles and many of our members send private parcels.

On 1 June we had the sweet stall at the Red Cross Fete and on 5 June we sent £30-2-6 to the Adelaide Cheer-up Hut to help entertain 700 returning soldiers and another £20 similarly at a later date. In June also £30 went to the League of Loyal Women to provide comforts for soldiers and sailors.

£25 was raised towards a piano for our room at the Rifle Match Day on 25 June. On 6 July Violet Day was successful despite bad weather and the same month we paid for 100 Christmas boxes to be sent through the League of Loyal Women. £20 went to the SA Auxiliary Tobacco Fund. That month also saw a thank you social for Mr J. Pearce, who supplies our room and a Frolic was held in aid of the Piano Fund.

In August £30 went to provide Christmas boxes via the Army Nurses Association and £30 for Christmas puddings for the troops. A Girls’ Frolic aided our sweets stall, which raised £40 on Australia Day. A Birthday Button Day on 30 November and a special gift stall raised £150 for The Hut. Cases of cake and fruit went to Keswick Military Hospital for Christmas. In January £50 went to the Trench Comforts Fund. £10 was sent to the Children’s Patriotic Carnival in April.

A horse was given to a returned soldier, otherwise stranded in Burra. We sent three large hams to The Hut for the Anzac Day luncheon. Altogether donations were over £400 for various patriotic purposes.

The Ladies’ band was a great feature of the year.

Their first appearance in Adelaide was on Violet Day 29 June 1917 and was very successful.

Their second was at the Commercial Travellers’ Carnival at Adelaide Oval on 27 October 1917.

The third was at the Seaside Trip to Semaphore combined with a recruiting meeting at Bowman’s Arcade and an afternoon’s program at Keswick Hospital.

Three other invitations to Adelaide have had to be refused up to 15 May 1918; since when there has been a visit.

The band also visited patriotic functions at Peterborough, Robertstown, Farrell’s Flat, Hanson, Leighton, Mt Bryan, Booborowie and in Burra for Violet Day, Australia Day, Navy Day, etc. Reluctantly they had to refuse two invitations to Clare and two to Pt Pirie and also invitations to Gawler, Saddleworth, Hallett, Spalding and World’s End.

The band owes much to Mr I.J. Warnes who has donated a large sum of money for instruments and has financed two trips to Morgan. There are several other generous donors we cannot mention individually. Thanks are also due to other bands who have lent music. The principal reason for the band was to greet returning soldiers at the station. Almost all have been so greeted unless they came by the midday train. Many other people are thanked for their support of the society in various ways.

Burra Cheer-up Soc.: The Ladies’ band Trip to Pt Pirie

The Band, along with Mr J. Bentley, E.W. Crewes & E.J. Harris, took the Broken Hill Express on Friday 7 June [to Peterborough] and thence to Pt Pirie, a journey of 9 hours, arriving at 6 a.m. on Saturday 8th. They were met by Mr G. Bull of the Adelaide YMCA and local YMCA representatives. They were taken to their billets and at 11 a.m. assembled in front of the Town Hall where a platform had been erected. They were welcomed by the Mayor, J. Forgan, and Mr Crewes responded.

The Band played selections and then paraded the streets playing selections. In groups of six they were given dinner at various hotels. At 2.30 they returned to the platform and stirring appeals were made by Mr G. Bull & Mr Crewes interspersed with selections by the Band. They collected £67 in small money. At 3.30 p.m. they had afternoon tea at the Barrier Hotel, after which it was back to work till 5 p.m. Later they reassembled at 7.30 p.m. for further work till 9.30 p.m. when they retired to their billets.

On Sunday they were conducted over the smelter and refinery. Their hosts took several girls out to places of interest in the afternoon. Following evening church they performed a sacred concert at the Alhambra Theatre, where the collection was £25.

On Monday a trip in two motorboats was organised. After dinner the girls played at a football match until it was time to catch the train home. On the way they played at Crystal Brook Station for the large crowd assembled there. They reached Peterborough at 11.10 and then had to wait for the Broken Hill Express – in the interval they were shunted up and down every line in the yard. The express arrived at 3.40 a.m. and Burra was reached at 6 a.m.

Editorial on Violet Day, to be held 24 June.

The editor reflects on the first Violet Day in Burra when a bunch of violets was auctioned and bought, raising almost £400. The mood of that time was of ‘comparatively light-hearted enthusiasm’, which has become now more one of ‘a stern sense of duty and a determination to “stick it” to the last’. Unfortunately in the process some have become deaf to patriotic appeals. Perhaps what they need is an occasional air-raid to remind them that the deadliest war of all history is raging. The day is dedicated to the no less than 70 local boys who have made the supreme sacrifice and they deserve a large gathering and the breaking of previous records.

Senior Constable McCarthy has been transferred to Adelaide from Redruth. Mr T. McWaters presented him with a purse of sovereigns in appreciation of his time here when a number of gentlemen assembled in the Liberal Union rooms last week.

Robert James McBride has just won his case against his daughter, Mrs Caroline Sandland, on appeal to the Full High Court in Melbourne. This overturns the order of Mr Justice Buchanan in the SA Supreme Court previously given in favour of the daughter. [The dispute was over ownership of a property at Flagstaff, which Mr McBride had bought in 1895 for £4,167, but which is now valued at about £12,000.] The court also ruled that Mr McBride was not entitled to costs in either court.

Burra Hospital Board

P.A. McBride resigned, as he had left the district.

No charge-nurse has been procurable for the salary of £80. [The going rate in Adelaide being £80-£90.] With respect to a query from the Inspector-General of Hospitals the Board replied that it was not in favour of a resident surgeon being appointed, but if one were the question of his being allowed to charge private patients at the hospital would depend solely on what salary was paid to him.

There was considerable discussion arising from the Chairman’s previous suggestion that people who could afford to pay had gone to Adelaide and got free treatment. The Adelaide authorities now wanted names! Mr A.J. McBride (Chairman) said he had spoken generally. Mr Radford and Mr Crewes seemed to want Mr McBride to talk his own way out of the difficulty, but ultimately the Board stood with him and said that he had been generalising and if a specific case came to their notice in future they would oblige with a name.

Christie & Gardner were offering to supply further figures re the electric light scheme. They are to be informed that Council is seeking information from others for comparison.

Burra Show Soc. The annual show will be held on Wednesday 23 October.

The ring will be moved to the NW of the present site as a trial.

The finance committee’s proposals re members’ tickets in three levels (£2-2-0, £1-1-0 & 10/6) were adopted. The £2-2-0 ticket idea was not passed without dissension. Mr Hawkes thought it would lose them money by giving unlimited entries to the larger exhibiters – especially damaging to the Sheep Show. Mr Warnes believed increased membership would counter that – entry fees last year brought in c. £20 at the Sheep Show, so not many more memberships were needed to break even.

Early Burra District History: by ‘T.H.B.’ reprinted from the Register.

Violet Day in Burra, Monday 24 June.

This day is the annual effort of the Cheer-up Society to honour the fallen and hearten and cheer those still at the front. The weather this year was perfect. Over 100 wreaths and other emblems with the violet predominating were hung around the rotunda. At 11 o’clock a procession assembled at the railway gates to await the arrival of the train with Brigadier-General Forsyth CMG and Staff for the proceedings. They were greeted by the Mayor E.W. Crewes and escorted to the car, which was in readiness to take them to Kooringa. Mr P. Milner acted as marshal. The escort comprised 20 mounted returned soldiers and one sailor under Sgt Dickson Thompson and Mr James Reed’s car carried those unable to ride. Following these came the Cheer-up Ladies’ band in white dresses and violet emblems. Then came the car carrying the Brigadier-General, the Mayor, Capt. Brown & Lieut. Pollard. Next was a detachment of 30 diminutive Red Cross nurses in snowy frocks and caps, each wearing a violet rosette on their apron. The Burra High School & State School & their Fife & Drum Band followed and then a lot of children dressed in national costumes of The Allies. Decorated cars followed. The most original display was by the Aberdeen Boys Messrs E. Hopcraft (as the Kaiser), R.G. Bernhardt, F. Cox, C. Tiver, A. Fuss & G. Sara. Their display was a gun carriage driven by A. Fuss & G. Sara. This was followed by a turnout on which the Kaiser was tied down under guard, having been arrested, according to a notice, while embarking for Hell at Gully’s Wharf. The Boy Scouts were followed by the cadets under Lieut. Fewster. Other decorated cars followed. Most admired was Glenister & Sams’ decorated solely in violets and white ribbon with a large golden cross: ‘In Memory of the Brave’. L.H. Foote’s car represented a blackfellow’s wurlie with L.H. Foote as the blackfellow with lubra and piccaninnies. The Curlew Concert Party from Adelaide had a representation of Dick Pascoe’s shaving saloon.

At 1 p.m. the Ladies’ band marched in silence from their hall to the rotunda with a huge wreath of bay leaves and a card bearing the names of 69 fallen men. Mr Crewes gave a moving address: 606 had gone and many had returned maimed or blind, 69 had made the supreme sacrifice. He called for donations, half for the local Cheer-up Wounded Soldiers’ Fund and half to go to Cheer-up work in Adelaide. Afterwards the band played To the Memory of Our Brave.

Brigadier-General Forsyth addressed the crowd.

W.G. Hawkes followed, citing Pericles address to the Athenians from some 500 B.C.

A bunch of violets was auctioned and realised £250.

At 3 p.m. the Boy Scouts gave a creditable display.

The High School girls played a basketball match at 4 p.m.

There were many other attractions including entertainment from a Concert Party of Returned Soldiers.

Frank Harris ran a chocolate wheel where the holder of the lucky number, bought for 6d, won a large box of chocolates.

Mr Luke Day ran the Paddy’s Market most successfully, assisted by a number of helpers.

There were weight guessing competitions and various stalls set up under verandahs around Market Square

They included a sweet stall, fruit, flowers, jumble, souvenirs & buttons, luncheon and afternoon teas.

At the oval Aberdeen beat Clare at football by 2.5.

Total proceeds were c. £530.

Meetings have been held every other Thursday with 30-40 present each time.

This year there has been no demand for garments and bed linen.

We provided luncheon and afternoon tea at the Annual Sheep Dog Trials and takings of £64-16-10 were sent to the Red Cross, as September had been set aside as Red Cross Month. Earlier in the year we had sent them £80.

We supplied luncheon and afternoon tea at the Show, but were unfortunately somewhat short of helpers on that occasion, but nevertheless the takings were £125-10-8.

Burra Licensing Court sat 10 July concerning renewal of licences for Mesdames Gregg, Seal, Richards, Boorman, and Clark.

Emilie Othlie Clark (Commercial Hotel) was supported by favourable reports from Inspector Archibald Watt and Constable Thomas McCarthy. There was a billiard room, two sample rooms, stabling for six horses and pit toilets, but lavatories were in the course of erection. Adjourned.

Mrs F.A. Gregg (Bon Accord Hotel). The Inspector reported it to be fairly well furnished and clean. It had neither sample rooms nor billiards, but stabling for six horses. It was hard to say if it was necessary. It was used mainly by railwaymen and wheat lumpers. The toilets were pits, but septic tanks were being installed. Constable McCarthy said it was well conducted and necessary for the class of people who used it. Mrs Gregg had it for six months after her husband’s death: he had held the licence for seven years. She was very busy on sale days and when there were functions at the Showgrounds. It was largely used by Booborowie people. Several other witnesses gave support.

George Lord (Burra Hotel). The Inspector said it was well kept and had up-to-date sanitary conveniences and was lit with electric light. Constable P. North agreed it was well conducted as did Constable McCarthy.

Mrs Elizabeth Richards (Court House Hotel). The Inspector found it well kept and comfortably furnished with no billiards or sample rooms. There were pit toilets and it was lit by acetylene gas. Police evidence supported the application. Mrs Richards had held the licence for 12 years and had just renewed her lease for 5 years.

Mrs Annie Seal (Kooringa Hotel). The Inspector reported it was properly furnished and clean with a billiard room, but no sample room. There was an acetylene gas plant, but currently used kerosene lamps. There was stabling for 11 horses and the sanitary arrangements were pits. The police supported the application as did several witnesses.

Renewals were granted for the Burra, Kooringa, Commercial & Bon Accord Hotels. The cases for the Court House & Royal Exchange were adjourned till September.

‘A Ratepayer’ writes suggesting that instead of planting trees on a fine open space by the school that is useful for active sports, the children plant red gums along the bed of the creek.

Pte Cyril Stewart recounts his war experiences. He left for the front on 31 May 1915 and was 12 weeks on Gallipoli when he was taken ill, spent three months in hospital, returned to Gallipoli and then stayed till evacuation. He then went to France and fought at Armentieres, Messines, the Somme, Pozieres & Ypres. He was wounded on 5 November 1916 at Fleurs and spent 48 hours nearly up to his neck in mud before being rescued by the Germans and taken to Cambrai, where he was operated on without anaesthetic for the removal of a bone in the elbow. He later had two similar operations. He was then sent to Stettin where three further operations were needed, also without anaesthetic. His food was mainly mangolds and swedes. There was a final operation at Altdann. Red Cross parcels were then getting through and after three months he went to a camp where there were 80,000 prisoners, mainly Russians, but about 500 British & Australians as well. The prisoners had to work in the fields or the coal mines. Attempts to escape always failed because they were about 350 miles from Holland. Finally he was moved to Mannaheim and on 28 December 1917 was included in a prisoner exchange. Two of his brothers also enlisted. One was invalided home some time ago and the other is still at the front.

Burra Cheer-up Soc.

Last Friday the Ladies’ band went to Adelaide to take part in the Red Cross Appeal. On arrival they went to Flinders St where the procession was to begin. It being Show Week the crowds were huge. The procession began at 11a.m. Mounted Police led the Crusaders and Returned Soldiers carrying Red Cross Banners, then Lady Galway, the Red Cross Committee and The Ladies’ band. They were followed by about 3,000 women in white dresses and then the Red Cross Trollies. The Governor took the salute from a platform at the Town Hall. The Mitcham Band was opposite to play a march for the procession. The Ladies’ band played several selections in the afternoon.

On Saturday afternoon the Mitcham Band and the Ladies’ band provided music at the War Tank Demonstration at Unley Oval. A large crowd had come to see the tank from the French battlefields. Lady Galway christened it by the name of ‘Grit’ it with a bottle of champagne. A silk Union Jack was then auctioned and the Burra Cheer-up Society bought it with a £60 bid. Mr Crewes was presented with the flag by Lady Galway and he had a ride in the tank, which went over trenches and obstacles in a demonstration. It finally demolished a stone building labelled ‘German Headquarters’. The Band returned on a special train at 7 p.m.

On Saturday evening Pte Wesley Nankivell returned to Burra unannounced and so missed a welcome at the station, but he was on hand on Friday morning at the Adelaide Station to welcome the Band!

Burra Boy Scout Room: Laying of Foundation Stone

Mr Rigney organised the Scout Troop three years ago and since then great work has been done. When the building is finished the boys will have a home of their own in a solid well built form comprising two large rooms: one 45’ x 20’ and the other 20’ x 20’.

Proceedings began with a march from Market Square with the Cheer-up Ladies’ band and the school Fife & Drum Band with the Boy Scouts under Scoutmaster Rigney, Wolf-Cubs under P-L George Sara and the schoolchildren with Mr Hitchcox. Councillors and others assembled at the site. There were speeches by Mr Winnall, Rev. H. Hopton (who had been Scoutmaster at Auburn) and Scoutmaster Rigney before Mr Crewes laid the stone. They had their first home burnt down [the old White Hart Hotel] and their second was the Waterworks. The present site had been given by Mr James Reed with an old building on it. Mr I.J. Warnes had given a generous donation. Three years ago there had been 18 scouts and there were now 42. One of their old members, Horton Jennison, was at the front. A collection after the stone laying raised £60, including a horse worth £20 from Mr G. Sampson. The Soldiers’ Aid Soc. then provided tea in a marquee and added a further £8 to the total.

The Boy Scouts sought permission for their steps at the front of the building to encroach on Council property. Cr Radford thought it an unfortunate eventuality and wondered about liability in the event of an accident, but the request was granted.

The Seventh War Loan. Up to Monday evening the Town & District Council areas had promised about £31,000 and the target of £50,000 seemed a distant prospect, but on that evening Messrs A.J. & P.A. McBride decided to contribute £17,500, which enabled the town to carry the burden which in relation to other quotas was so unfairly placed upon it.

Other contributors in excess of £1,000 are:

C. Bartholomaeus £4,000

C.B. Warnes £3,000

H.H. Thomas £2,000

£1,000 each comes from Elder, Smith & Co., T.H. Pearse & Sons, J. Tennant & T. McWaters.

In surrounding areas Hallett trebled its quota and Mt Bryan doubled it. It seems that Booborowie, Apoinga and Hanson will reach theirs – in each case their quota was £5,000.

By last evening the district total had reached £53,000, but there are not more than 150 subscribers, so a large number of people have not realised their responsibility and duty yet.

Burra Show, 23 October.

The weather was not particularly good with strong NW wind raising dust. Nevertheless attendance was very large. Entries for horses were up. Cattle, pigs, sheep and dogs were about average. Implements were well displayed. In flowers the Messrs Fuss secured most prizes with W. Carpenter getting the honours in sweet peas & stocks and N.W.R. Pearce for roses. Mr Chin Young’s vegetables were first class. Dairy produce had a good display, especially Mrs W. Bryce of Hallett. Competition in cookery was keen. Children’s work and art and industry displays were admired. Art prizes went particularly to Miss Vera Pascoe, Mrs Bridgwood & Mr L.H. Foote. Side shows were numerous and did good business. Gate money was £1 up on last year despite members’ vehicles getting free admission for the first time.

Local Board of Health

The decision in the case brought by Lawn & Co. was in favour of the Board of Health.

The Salvation Army has just completed their annual Self Denial Appeal and the local corps has raised £553-10-0 compared with £181-10-0 last year. This result ranks second in SA and tenth in Australia. Captain Trigg and his fellow members can be proud of their effort.

A recruiting meeting was held at Leighton on 24 October by Sgt Thompson & Lieut. Phillips.

Navy Day in Burra was held on Friday [sic]

[For weeks the advertising had been for Wednesday 30 October, so this is presumably an error, especially as we are told the decoration committee set to work on Tuesday evening.]

Bunting went up all over the square etc., and marquees and stalls were erected, but by dawn a gale was blowing and decorations were hastily taken down to save damage. The demonstration was hastily transferred to the Institute. It was decided to proceed with the procession, starting from the station with the arrival of the Naval Band. The train was half an hour late. With the band came Lieut. Argent of the Naval Depot, the Mayor of Pt Adelaide (C. Smith) & J.N. Laurence of Adelaide Seamen’s Mission.

The procession was led by mounted returned soldiers under Lieut. Phillis & Sgt D. Thompson, then the Cheer-up Ladies’ band, the Boy Scouts, The Naval Band (26 in number), Copperhouse schoolchildren in sailor costumes, decorated pram of Miss Nellie Gray, Tin-can Band, Burra State School Children, then numerous cars and buggies, but with little decoration due to the boisterous weather.

At the square the Naval Band and the Ladies’ band joined forces in selections. Mr Crewes announced that the appeal and auction would be held at 2.30 in front of the Institute, which provided a little shelter. At 2.30 the two bands played again in front of the Institute and Mr Crewes spoke. Last year £700 had been raised and he hoped for a similar total this year. Lieut. Argent also spoke, followed by Mt Smith (Mayor of Pt Adelaide) and Mr J.N. Laurence.

Then a wonderful model of HMAS Sydney, made by men at the Naval Depot, was put up for auction by Lin Gordon, late Lieutenant in AIF and £435 was realised. Mr J.H. Gallagher became the owner for £106.

The report mentions four bands, but it is not clear which are intended; presumably the Ladies’ band, the Naval Band, the Men’s Band and the Fife & Drum Band, assuming the Tin-can Band was just a bit of procession fun.

The report then describes the usual stalls. By the end of the day c. £634 had been raised.

Dr Thomas Ashton writes denying that he had said sufficient isolation could be arranged at home in the ongoing squabble over the Kellaway case. He backed the action of Mr Crewes over the attack of Mr McBride.

Burra Sporting & Athletic Club reports that the profit from its sports meeting on 9 October was about £70. A heated discussion took place about making presentations to soldiers who returned a considerable time before the club started and eventually it was decided to send wallets to:

Pte Voumard Pte McBride Pte Prior

Pte Lockett Pte Stewart Pte Parks

Pte Aldridge

And to Pte W. Nankivell when it is established he enlisted at Burra.

The following minute was then recorded:

‘That wallets be sent to all returned soldiers who have lived in the Burra six months prior to enlisting and that have enlisted at Burra – but not otherwise.’

PEACE

News that the armistice had been signed reached Burra about 9.30 p.m. Monday evening.

The news was announced by ringing the fire bell and soon there was a regular pandemonium of noise and within fifteen minutes Market Square was crowded and the Ladies and Men’s Bands combined for the National Anthem and then the Doxology was sung. Cheers were given for Our Boys, The Allies, General Foch and The King. The Mayor and Mr Winnall gave short speeches and the bands played patriotic airs. It was the early hours of morning before calm returned. Tuesday was observed as a holiday and the town was decorated with flags and by 10.30 a.m. the square was crowded and a platform had been erected.

A procession of nearly 1,000 thankful men, women and children extended the length of Commercial St from Messrs C.J. Pearce & Son to E.J. Harris’s, headed by the Returned Soldiers, the Mayor, Councillors, the town’s Ministers and the combined bands. Cheer after cheer greeted the returned men and Lieut. Phillis made a suitable speech. A short thanksgiving service followed.

After a moving speech the Mayor read the official telegram from the Premier. There were brief speeches from Rev. H.H. Hopton, W.G. Hawkes, Rev. D.B. Bridgwood, Mr Winnall and Rev. A.J. Finch. In the afternoon the Men’s Band played in the street.

Obituary. Thomas Haskard died at Prospect. He was born at Barkstone in England 9 April 1858 [sic]* and arrived in SA in the Mary Shephard 18 April 1865. He was a blacksmith and machinist in Burra before going to Clare in 1875 and about 9 years ago went to live in Adelaide. He is survived by five sons and three daughters: Messrs J. Haskard (Broken Hill), J. Haskard (Jamestown), Gregory Haskard (Victor Harbor), A. Haskard (Crystal Brook), R.H. Haskard (Torrensville) – who was severely wounded at Gallipoli, Mrs Newman (Broken Hill), Mrs Ashby (Booleroo Centre) & Mrs Stockman (Hyde Park). There are 31 grandchildren and 9 great grandchildren. He was a member of the Burra Burra Lodge of Oddfellows for 52 years. Mrs Haskard, his widow was illiterate until the present war started and taught herself to read and write at the age of 80.

[* Given the age of his wife his birth date above seems likely to be an error, perhaps by 20 years and BISA gives birth 9 April 1838 at Barkestone Leicestershire (Barkestone-le-Vale?). Registration gives death 29 October 1918 Goodwood.]

Obituary. Dan Quinn of Hallett died at Jamestown Hospital last Saturday of pneumonia following influenza. His widow, Ada Quinn, is the fifth daughter of John Wise, late of ‘Cartapoo’.

T.P.L. Medwell, a porter at Burra station, was crushed between the buffers of two trucks when the frame of a wagon of wool caught on one of the trucks. He is progressing well in hospital.

The French Commission was given a brief reception at the station on Wednesday night when the train stopped for eight minutes. The Mayor welcomed General Pau and other members. Joan Maunsell presented a bouquet. The Ladies’ band played the Marsellaise as the party rejoined the train and it moved on.

Burra Cheer-up Soc.

The Ladies’ band was to have gone to Adelaide on the morning of the 12 November, but unanimously agreed that their first duty was to Burra and so stayed for the celebrations on Tuesday morning and left by the afternoon train. On arrival in Adelaide they were taken to The Hut and given a rousing reception. The Band then headed the Cheer-up Contingent to the Exhibition [Building?] where a multitude of mainly women had assembled to honour the French Mission, General Pau and the women of France. They played selections till the Governor and Lady Galway arrived, when they played the National Anthem and accompanied the singing in the evening. The Girls were invited to remain and take part in the Monster Peace Celebrations on Thursday, but they returned to Burra on the train carrying the French Mission.

On Thursday the Ladies’ band assisted at the demonstration in Market Square.

On Saturday they went to the Leighton Fete.

Today, Wednesday, they are taking part in the fete in aid of patriotic funds at Mrs A. Melrose’s ‘Kadlunga’ at Mintaro.

On Friday Cheer-ups are in charge of the sweet stall at the Returned Soldiers’ Fair in the Institute.

Booborowie Requirements

On 15 November about 120 farmers gathered at the Woolshed to discuss the needs of the district with MPs Buxton & Jenkins.

A railway was seen as the prime need – Hanson to Booborowie being preferred.

Mr Jenkins said the only thing preventing the construction was the cost due to the war and he expected that now it would fall. He feared the move back to larger estates.

School accommodation was the next issue.

Presently the school was very unsatisfactory. It was held in a church whose trustees have said it would not be available after Christmas unless decided steps were taken for a new school. The members promised as much support as they could for a new school.

PEACE Celebrations continued last Thursday.

Mt Bryan. Thursday was a school holiday. The children were given lunch in the Hall. Then there was a procession around the town and a joyous meeting in the Hall. Chair was I.J. Warnes, Chairman of the DC. Mr Warnes gave a speech hoping that ‘The Great War would be the last war’ and urging all to continue to support the fighting men when they returned. He also praised the patriotism of the area that had subscribed £21,800 to the 7th War Loan when the target had been £5,000. He expressed concern though about returned men without experience being put on the land; many would not be in good health. He feared many would not succeed. He called for understanding and support for those who would return with poor health and in many cases with shattered nerves.

Mr Crewes spoke after Mr Warnes, seeing God’s hand in the victory.

Mr Warnes said he felt a statue of some sort with the names of those who had gone should be erected in Mt Bryan and he would subscribe 25 guineas towards it.

Hallett

On hearing news of peace a strong committee was formed and a procession and sports on the oval was organised for Thursday with a concert and dance to follow. The procession left the Institute at 2 p.m. with District Councillors, Hallett Band, school children & decorated vehicles, including Drew & Crewes trolly with a gallows on it and the Kaiser hanged by the neck in effigy. At the sports ground there were speeches by Mr Richards, Chairman of the DC, Rev. I’Anson & Cr McDonald.

The sports results are printed.

Burra

Celebrations continued on Thursday afternoon when the united bands turned out and speeches were made and a good time had generally. Mr E. Cock hoped rumours of the Crown Prince’s death were true and the Kaiser with him.

Rev. D.B. Bridgwood was heartily tired of hearing ministers speak, but went on to give an address praising the allies for their honourable conduct in the war, compared with German atrocities.

Captain Trigg spoke also of the joy of victory, but scarcely knew whether to rejoice at rumour of the Crown Prince’s death as death was too good for him.

Sgt Harvey Sweeney, a visitor from Victoria, spoke of the ongoing need for support that returning men would need. In the evening there was a concert in the open air and among contributors were returned men Sgt Swanson, Cpl Burgess & Driver Darmody.

Peace Thanksgiving Services

On Thursday 14 November a service was held at Redruth Methodist Church by Rev. D.B. Bridgwood.

On Sunday 17 November a special service was held in conjunction with the Redruth Sunday School, conducted by the Superintendent Mr H.H. Thomas. There were addresses by Messrs Hitchcox & Dunhill. The evening service also took the form of a thanksgiving service.

Similar services took place at the Kooringa Methodist Church and Sunday school, where the Superintendent, John Drew, conducted proceedings. Rev. A.J. Finch conducted the church service.

Rev. H.H. Hopton conducted thanksgiving services at St Mary’s on Sunday at 3 p.m. & 7 p.m.

Burra Town Council

H. Lord offered to light the rotunda each night for a year till 11.30 with a 60 watt lamp, controlled from the hotel, if Council would pay £4 plus 50/- to 60/- for installation costs. Offer accepted.

A deputation will wait on the Commissioner of Public Works seeking enlarged water mains in the town. Cr Radford said almost continuous pumping scarcely kept the bottom of the tank wet.

Local Board of Health.

The Lawn case had cost the Board £45.

Cr Dane pointed out that the money resulted in a defining of the Board’s position. Lawn & Co. lost, but the judge had said that the inspector had no right to destroy the carcass and in that Mr McBride’s contention was correct. The mayor said the Board had won because the owner had acquiesced in the destruction of the carcass.

Catholic Ladies provided supper at 11 p.m. and dancing continued till c. 1 a.m.

Soldiers’ Aid Soc. The need for our work will continue for many months yet despite the end of the war. The fund now stands at £1,430-11-4 raised since the beginning of the society.

Burra Hospital Board.

Mr Fair-weather will provide specifications for electric light by 23 November.

Mr Warnes was concerned that the costs of infectious cases were not covered by the agreement with the Local Board of Health, but the others felt little could be done as the agreement was the same as in Adelaide. Mr Warnes said it would be fair if all infectious cases were sent to the hospital, but Dr Williams said many could be satisfactorily isolated at home. The hospital decided to end its agreement with the Railways & Tramways Hospital Fund, as the reimbursements received did not nearly match the costs of their members.

Mayoralty.

A deputation has waited upon Mr Crewes to stand again as Mayor. Because he would like to be part of peace celebrations and have a role in erecting a fitting memorial in Market Square for the boys of Burra & District, he agreed.

Peace Day

A meeting was held last Thursday to organise the best way to celebrate peace. The date cannot be fixed until after the Peace Conference at Versailles in January. Mr Penrose was appointed to be responsible for decorations. It was decided to have a two-day celebration: one in Market Square, historically the centre for activities, and a second the following Saturday at Victoria Park for the children.

Soldiers’ Aid and Red Cross will provide the luncheon, the Caledonian Soc. will be asked to send three bagpipers. J.C. Killicoat will convene the procession and funds collected will go towards the Memorial for the Town & District.

F. Harris is in charge of souvenirs and buttons. Messrs Crewes, McLaren & Dane were appointed a committee to put in a claim for a gun or two by way of trophies.

This was a great success with the firm backing of the local Red Cross, Soldiers’ Aid Soc., Cheer-up Soc. & League of Loyal Women. At the promenade concert in the evening the Burra Ladies’ band played several selections. So far reports in give a total of £177-12-8.

Returning Anzacs Sgts Cecil Lord and Graham Dow were welcomed in Market Square and a large crowd gathered to honour them. State schoolchildren arrived led by their school band and staff and pupils from Hampton Court were also present. The Ladies’ band played a selection and the National Anthem. E.W. Crewes welcomed the returned men, followed by W.G. Hawkes, Rev. Bridgwood, Rev. H. Hopton & M.A. Radford. Sgts Lord & Dow responded briefly.

An American flag was auctioned and realised £80. Mr Norman McBride getting it with a bid of £21. The honoured guests were entertained at afternoon tea by the League of Loyal Women. Total proceeds were c. £120.

Redruth Junior Sunday School was opened 23 November by Mrs J.M. McBride, introduced by Rev. D.B. Bridgwood. Mr H.H. Thomas had bought the building and offered it to the trustees to be rented as a Sunday school. The building was thoroughly renovated and adapted. He hoped it would not be long before a large Sunday school could be erected on the land adjoining. The children then had a treat of good things including cool drinks and ice cream. Strawberries and cream were provided on the grounds too and the afternoon tea room was well patronised by the large attendance of parents and friends. [This refers to a building then immediately east of the Redruth Methodist Church that had previous been Richards’ bicycle shop. It was subsequently demolished when the Memorial Hall was built.]

Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting was held on Monday night with Mr Treloar in the chair.

The Mayor read his report. There were apologies:

Cr Greenwood and Mr Thomas were unwell.

Cr McWaters was suffering from an attack of modesty.

Cr Killicoat was caught in a dust storm out east.

Cr McBride, who is standing for re-election said West Ward had a substantial credit balance because they had preferred to defer work while wartime costs were three times normal.

Clem Pearce said he was standing because he thought Councillors should be residents and Mr McBride was not. He thought the number of private electrical systems had made a town scheme impossible. He favoured planting fewer trees, but attending to them better.

Mr Sampson, candidate for East Ward, would do his best if elected.

Mr Kellaway, also for East Ward, was in favour of tar-paving, but more economical methods should be employed. He also favoured more attention to fewer trees and fencing in the back streets. All meat should be inspected by the Council inspector.

All Councillors favoured a bridge at the ‘Pig & Whistle’ when funds were available – though they also agreed ratepayers’ approval would first be sought.

Mr Crewes said he would endeavour to get the districts involved with the soldiers’ memorial.

Acting SM A. Baynes & Sgt W. Klaffus have arrived in Adelaide.

Pte Hedley Bishop, who lost his right arm, is having trouble with his left one now as a result of a wound in the left breast.

Obituary. Pte Laurie Turner, youngest son of Mrs A. Turner of Thames St, has died in France of bronchial pneumonia. [Lawrence James Turner born Geraldton WA 3 March 1898: died 14 November 1918.]

Burra Cheer-up Soc.

The Cheer-up Soc. sweet stall at the RSL Fete raised £13-13-0 clear.

Socks are still urgently needed for the front.

The Ladies’ band etc. welcomed Sgts Cecil Lord & Graham Dow at the station last Thursday. The two were among the first 23 to enlist in 1914.

Next Friday an empty stall will be erected in front of Mr F. Harris’s shop and by the end of the day we hope it will be well stocked with donated pickles, sauces, jams, eggs, etc. for sending to Adelaide Cheer-up Hut. Our last parcel of socks will be despatched on 11 December so please have all contributions in by 10 December.

Peace Day Meeting at Leighton School last Saturday.

Mr Warnes took the chair and said they could have had a celebration at Leighton or have joined in at Burra. To have a Leighton celebration was much harder work, but it would be remembered by the children. He did not think collecting for the soldiers’ memorial was appropriate on that day, but Burra had so decided. Was Leighton to have a separate memorial? He had started a fund for that purpose for Mt Bryan and World’s End had decided to go on its own. In 20 or 30 years a Leighton Memorial might be neglected while a Burra one would not, on the other hand Burra would get 99% of the credit. The Districts were never asked to be represented on the big days, but were always asked to contribute when money was wanted. If it was to be a district affair then all districts would have to have a say and a quota of money to raise.

Mr Fairchild congratulated Mr Warnes on his candour and favoured a second Peace Day for the children locally, even if they went to Burra on their day.

A separate Leighton Peace Day was agreed upon.

Mr McDonald said the Mayor of Burra should ask for representatives of districts to attend a meeting about a memorial. He was not much taken with the idea of a memorial Market Square in marble or granite, which is what seems to have been taken for granted.

[He seems to have favoured planting avenues and beautifying parts of the town.]

Mr Fairchild feared some ‘inartistic thing’ might result and also favoured tree planting and perhaps a weir in the creek to create a beauty spot.

The meeting called for a conference of district representatives.

Marriage. On 12 November at the Congregational Church Bordertown.

Wilfred Vivian Geake, only son of Mr & Mrs W. Geake of Kooringa married

The Mayor’s Report for 1918.

The season’s prospects for farmers locally are fair and the pastoral industry is doing well. The stoppage of the Great European War after more than four years has been the occasion of great rejoicing. People of Burra have responded most heartily to all patriotic calls during the war and especially over the last 12 months.

The Seaside Trip was held on 23 February and over 1,100 availed themselves of the trip to Semaphore. Two trains were provided and the whole day was a great success.

The Burra Branch of the League of Loyal Women was established at a meeting on 29 January as a result of urgent calls for assistance in the Trench Comforts Fund. Mrs W.G. Hawkes was elected President with Miss D.L. Hawkes as Secretary and Mrs T. Ashton as Treasurer. Since 19 July they have operated a Luncheon & Tea-room at the Cheer-up Rooms in Kooringa, which has been largely patronised and a great source of funds.

Children’s Patriotic Demonstration

A major demonstration was held by the children of the Burra School on 13 April in aid of Red Cross. The Boy Scouts, Soldiers’ Aid Soc. & Returned Soldiers all assisted and about £130 was raised. During 1918 the contributions of scholars to the Children’s Patriotic Fund have been:

Primary School £226-5-101⁄2

High school £26-0-3

War Certificates

Primary School £80-10-0

High School £26-2-6

Burra Cheer-up Ladies’ band

This has been fully occupied with patriotic work. As well as assisting at all local patriotic efforts they have on several occasions assisted at efforts in Adelaide. They have also visited several country towns. They have attended the railway station to welcome home every returning boy. They have also collected large sums of money for the cause.

Violet Day

This was celebrated on 24 June in excellent weather and a monster procession headed by the Ladies’ band went from the railway station to Kooringa where the usual speeches were given. A bunch of violets was sold for £250 under the Bugler system. The usual stalls etc. operated and there was a concert in the evening by the Adelaide Curlew Concert Party. Proceeds amounted to c. £550. At the service in Market Square over 100 wreaths were hung by relatives and friends around the rotunda and Brigadier-General Forsayth delivered a most eloquent speech.

Red Triangle Day

Sunday 12 May saw the visit of Mr Virgo, Empire Secretary of the YMCA who gave a lecture at the Institute on the work of the society. £330 was raised to keep its activities going. Red triangle Day on Friday 31 May again had fine weather and stalls were erected. Returned Soldiers’ Concert Party entertained the crowd and the Ladies’ band attended. A silk flag was auctioned for £70 under the Bugler system. The Ladies’ band took a prominent part in the evening concert and the day raised in all c. £700.

Boy Scouts

This important organisation for the boys has long felt the need of a drill hall of its own or a room for their meetings. On Saturday 28 September a crowd gathered in Market Square and marched to Aberdeen to take part in the laying of the foundation stone for the new building. The stone was laid by the Mayor and donations of £60 were laid on the stone and £8 came from afternoon tea. Membership has risen from 18 to 42 in three years.

Anniversary of the War

This was held on 10 August; again in perfect weather. Large crowds gathered in Market Square and the town was extensively decorated. The usual sort of procession led by the Ladies’ band took place with a Queen competition, stalls, Cheap Jack etc. Colonel S. Price Weir DSO addressed the gathering. The auction of a gold button under the Bugler system realised £273-14-0. The Institute was crowded for a magnificent film show at night and in all the total proceeds were c. £1,438.

Navy Day

This was observed in very bad weather on Friday 1 November. The Square had been decorated and stalls erected, but the latter were moved to the Institute and the decorations taken down to save them from damage. The Naval Band arrived at 11.30 under Lieut. Argent. The procession was led by the Ladies’ band and the Naval Band and the School Band took part. After speeches the model of HMAS Australia was auctioned under the Bugler system and raised £435. Despite the difficulties imposed by the weather the day raised £650.

Red Cross Day

On Friday 6 September the Red Cross under Mrs C.J. Pearce as Secretary held a most successful Button Day to raise funds to provide food and other necessities for POWs in Germany. The business places and streets were well decorated and stalls arranged in Market Square. Luncheon & afternoon tea was provided in Drew & Crewes new shops. A Union Jack donated by Mrs John Tennant was auctioned and raised £160. The Ladies’ band played during the day and the Dinkum Concert Party performed in the Institute at night. About £500 was raised.

Burra Sporting & Athletic Club

During the year this club provided many welcome home socials. Much has been due to the tireless work of the Secretary Mr George Hann and the President, Mr J.H. Gallagher.

Burra Show

This was held on 23 October which was a very windy day with raised dust, but attendance was very large and the show very good. The Soldiers’ Aid Soc. ladies provided luncheon and afternoon tea and did very well. The Burra Band was in attendance and played selections during the day. Gate takings were £94, up £1 on 1917.

Seventh War Loan.

Burra was set the target of £50,000, which seemed impossibly high, but on 4 October the war tank ‘Haig’ visited Burra and the Ladies’ band joined in and afterwards the appeal reached £22,020. Eventually over £52,000 was raised.

Supreme Sacrifice

Since the last report many more of our brave lads have paid the supreme sacrifice and to date about 66 have laid down their lives.

Cheer-up Soc.

On Friday 29 November the society made a special effort to raise funds and gifts for the Cheer-up Hut in Adelaide. The rotunda and streets were decorated and stalls erected. Cash proceeds amounted to £150 plus produce and goods.

Soldiers’ Aid Soc.

This has continued its splendid work and has despatched vast quantities of warm clothing, socks etc. to the front. The amount collected since the start is now £1,430-11-4.

PEACE

The message came through on Monday evening 11 November that Germany had signed the Armistice and hostilities had ceased. Soon bells were ringing and hundreds of residents assembled in Market Square. The Ladies and Men’s Bands assembled and played the National Anthem and the Doxology was sung. Tuesday was a holiday and the town was decorated gaily and a monster procession was formed of over 1,000 people at 10.30 a.m.

[The accounts then follow.]

The General account began the year in credit £60-9-1

It ends the year in credit £50-4-4

North Ward began in credit £19-6-5

And ends the year in credit £1-6-8

East Ward began the year in debit £22-10-2

And ends the year in debit £24-1-10

West Ward began the year in credit £36-18-6

And ends the year in credit £58-0-3

Park Land account began the year in credit £10-8-2

And ends the year in credit £7-15-8

The Cemetery account began the year in credit £112-11-6

And ends the year in credit £122-4-2

The Main Road grant was £350, which was £80 less than for 1917 and it was necessary to apply for £160 extra. This was advanced, but we have asked for it to be regarded as a special grant, not an advance, and we hope that comes to pass.

Tar Paving has proved both sound and economical when done properly. We look forward to a time when all the main roads will be paved. In February a move was made to do all of Market Square and storekeepers promised 17 casks of tar towards this. The work was not done due to a dispute over which ward should carry out the work. I urged it be done at the expense of the whole town. In the near future I hope to see the present enclosure enlarged to house a memorial to the brave boys who have made the supreme sacrifice in the Great War – after which tarring can be completed.

Local Board of Health

The general sanitary conditions in the town have been satisfactory. There were several infectious cases throughout the year. Despite some heavy legal costs of £45-11-2 over the Lawn & Co. case we started the year £48-16-8 in credit and ended in credit £13-4-11.

The Medical Officer reported 11 cases of scarlatina and 3 cases of diphtheria. Mouse-plague of favus was prevalent last summer. [A fungal infection: a form of ringworm.]

Lighting Account

The year began with a debit of £8-10-11 and ends with a debit of £30-9-4. The high cost of carbide was a major problem and had we not reduced lighting times the debt would have been worse. Costs rose from £7-10-0 to £9-10-0 per lamp. Various offers to install electricity have been made, but high costs of machinery etc. due to the war made Council defer a decision. In the meantime arrangements have been made with some private firms to provide a few electric lights.

Mayor E.W. Crewes elected unopposed

West Ward A.J. McBride 72

C.W. Pearce 32

Mr E.W. Crewes, now elected for his 6th term as Mayor, establishes a record, as no other person has held the office so long. Mr Crewes was born in Somerset in June 1859, but his parents were from Cornwall. He came to Burra in 1878 and was employed first by Gartrell & Co. of Aberdeen and then with Messrs Drew & Co. He later opened a branch business for them in NSW before going into partnership with Mr John Drew at Kooringa from whence branches were established at Mt Bryan and Hallett. Something over six years ago the business became drew & Crewes Pty Ltd with Mr Crewes as managing director. He has always had an interest in public affairs and has been a Councillor at various times. He was first elected Mayor in 1901 and held the position for three years. He was elected again in 1913 and each time the outbreak of war imposed a heavy workload, which he has discharged with energy and enthusiasm. He is president of every patriotic society in the town, a member of the Hospital Board and President of the Institute.

St Mary’s Strawberry Fete was held last Friday in the Institute. It was very successful and raised £125.

Visiting Day at Burra School was held last Wednesday.

Proceedings began with physical drill accompanied by the band. Then the headmaster Mr Hitchcox gave his annual report. The school had 262 on the roll, comprising 129 boys and 133 girls. At the inspection the school had been classed ‘A’ for excellent. Five one-penny concerts in the year raised £10 for improvements. A concert organised for 19 December aimed to raise money for a piano. The school had raised £252-6-11⁄2 for the Children’s Patriotic Fund: £132 from the Red Cross effort at Victoria Park in April, £18 from self denial tins, £15 from a Children’s Bazaar in Kooringa, £11 from the Aberdeen effort recently and over £100of War Certificates had been purchased by the children. Half of the scholars were wearing war service medals, some with up to five bars and two had earned the ‘Star’ decoration for giving over £6: the Misses Gwen Humphris & Jean McLaren. 27 framed pictures had been bought with money from the Seaside Picnic Committee.

Mr J. Biddle reported on the High School. With an average of 35 pupils the High School had raised £26 for the Patriotic Fund and worked with the Primary School in activities. 22 pupils had war service medals and one had a ‘Star’. The year began with 42 pupils and ended with 31 compared with 22 last year. Miss Jones had transferred from Primary to High to help with the numbers.

Last year Josephine West gained the Junior Public Certificate and Jean McLaren a Senior Commercial Certificate, topping the exam and winning the John Cresswell Scholarship.

Mr McLaren gave a speech on behalf of the School Committee. Rev. Hopton & Rev. Bridgwood, Mr Crewes & Mr Winnall also spoke, the last named announcing a half-holiday.

Soldiers’ Aid Soc. has donated £25 to the French Red Cross instead of holding a button day for them. They are making a final appeal for any socks on hand as it is assumed they will not be required for much longer.

Fires. Just after the Broken Hill express on Monday morning fire broke out in Messrs Kellock Bros wheat crop one mile west of Kooringa and about 40 acres were burnt.

This time Messrs Rogers lost 70 tons of hay and the fire reached the quarry near the hospital.

Soldiers’ Memorial. Conference of District Representatives.

Mr Crewes responded to the recent Leighton meeting and wrote to the DCs of Mt Bryan, Booborowie, Apoinga, Hanson, Hallett & Burra, asking the Chairmen to meet him and a conference took place at the Burra Institute on 18 December. Those present were the Mayor, Crs T. McWaters, Kellock, & Pearse (Burra), I.J. Warnes (Mt Bryan), A.E. McWaters (Booborowie), Thomas & Radford (Burra Corporation) & some town residents.

The Mayor said several schemes had been mooted

A statue in Market Square

A suitable club building for returned men

With respect to a club building – clubs had been tried before and always died out after a while and such a place would need a caretaker and ongoing expenses.

Mr McDonald, Chairman of the Booborowie DC wrote apologising for his absence and calling for public meetings in the districts to discuss the alternatives, and for a debate in the press.

Mr Hawkes for Apoinga also apologised, but he favoured one fine memorial at a suitable place and would not like to see districts split into sections.

Cr Roger from Hanson also wrote in.

Cr Warnes was rather surprised to see more than representatives there and under those circumstances did not see it as a conference. There was then considerable dissention about who should be present and what their role was.

Mr Crewes said his position was well known – a subscription from the districts and Burra of £1,500 for the purpose of a suitable memorial in Market Square. He did not support a memorial in each district and he feared if they were erected they would soon be neglected.

Cr Warnes was concerned that the outside districts were not given credit for their efforts and had to have representation. He personally did not favour many small memorials.

His others thought were for

an avenue of trees – say from Burra to Mt Bryan

a weir across Burra Creek

an isolation ward at Burra Hospital

He quite liked a statue, but was not sure it would be well received in outside districts.

Cr C.T. McWaters was not prepared to vote, but leaned towards a central monument.

Cr A.E. McWaters was also not prepared to decide yet, but leant towards a central monument, though each district would have to be represented on the executive and be duly represented at the opening etc.

Cr Warnes & Cr McWaters complained that they never got invitations to activities in Burra as official representatives of the DCs. Cr McWaters thought that if a monument was erected specific places on it needed to be allotted to each district. If a garden was to be maintained each district should have its own plot.

Cr Pearse favoured a lasting memorial – something like the memorial on North Terrace. Trees in a few years would be just trees.

Cr Kellock would like to see unity.

Cr Thomas favoured a central monument: in 50 years small memorials would be neglected and dilapidated. He favoured allocating each district its proper proportion and its proper representation on the executive. He hoped for no split – he had heard that even one of Burra’s own Wards wanted its own memorial. Nothing worthy could be done if they all split.

Cr Warnes did not think it fitting to raise funds on Peace Day.

The Mayor said there were to be three Peace Days: one of thanksgiving, one of rejoicing and one for the children. He thought it a most suitable day to ask for donations.

Cr Warnes thought there should be a Memorial Day.

Cr Radford said that concerning the lack of official invitations to District Councils that the Burra Town Council had nothing to do with that – it was a matter in the hands of the various patriotic societies.

Cr Warnes said the patriotic bodies never recognised the districts and as President of several district bodies he could say no official invitations ever reached them. He believed there would be better support for tree plantings or an isolation ward. He had been asked personally, never officially to functions.

Mr Crewes said: On how many occasions have the outside districts gone on their own? If the idea they were not valued was prevalent he was sorry: it was not the slightest intent of any patriotic body

[Continued page 4]

not to give the district due recognition.

Cr Warnes said Leighton had decided to have Peace Day at home, but he was prepared to advocate something in Burra if a scheme came forward that the district people could support. For a piece of statuary it would be difficult to get support.

Cr Kellock said public meetings were essential.

Cr A.E. McWaters said people might easily choose a small local memorial option.

Cr McWaters said that at World’s End they had decided to spend £100 on a memorial and at one meeting £60-£70 was subscribed.

Mr Crewes thought it would be a shame if the district’s names were not inscribed on the Burra Memorial.

Cr Thomas believed Burra people would be agreeable and anxious to give the districts representation.

Cr Pearse was averse to a number of memorials. Local Honour Rolls would perpetuate local memories. His firm had promised 50 guineas and would double it if necessary for a central memorial.

The final decision was:

That a suitable monument be erected in Burra by Burra & District.

That the Corporation & each DC be asked to appoint two delegates to form an executive committee.

Characteristics of the paper in 1918.

Page 1

Large advertisements in the main and mostly of local origin.

Page 2

A mixture of different sized advertisements, but nearly all are local and particularly concerned with sales, local government and public announcements. The amount of news fluctuates from none to almost half the page.

Page 3

News and a couple of larger advertisements.

Page 4

Some news in fluctuating amounts, but advertisements generally dominate, though some of them look very much like news items at first glance.

The paper in general gives a very good cover of district events throughout the year and in particular traces the lives and deaths of district servicemen and women. Local patriotic efforts are covered in considerable detail.

Numbering of issues in 1918

The year began with Volume XXXX Number 1 on 9 January 1918.

Redruth Court

William Wilks, farmer of Mt Bryan, sued Jehu Lomman, farmer of Mt Bryan, for illegal possession of a scoop. Wilks bought the scoop in 1916 from Robert Scott and it was missed in June or July 1918. M-C Giles found it in November 1918.

Giles gave evidence of finding the scoop on Lomman’s property in November 1918. Lomman claimed to have bought it in Adelaide in March or April, but could not remember the man’s name, didn’t think he got a receipt. Wilks identified the scoop.

Wilks gave evidence that the scoop belonged to his son, William, who is on active service. He swore to modifications made to it that identified it. Lomman claimed he had made the modifications and produced a piece of iron he said was left over from the job.

Robert Scott identified the scoop as one sold to Wilks on 28 April 1916.

F.F. W. Richards, stationmaster at Mt Bryan, denied the scoop had arrived by train from Adelaide as maintained by Lomman.

William Rule of Aberdeen, blacksmith, said he made the bottom plates for Lomman on 15 November 1918.

Arthur Rush, blacksmith, said he had worked on two bows similar to those shows for Albert Lomman, but could not swear these were the ones.

Lomman gave evidence of having bought the scraper in Adelaide and having had it sent up by rail. He recounted its use. He now claimed he had obtained a receipt.

His daughter gave evidence of having seen a receipt with J.S. and a date on it, but though she put it on file she had not looked for it.

Two sons, Clarence and Alfred, gave supporting evidence.

William Cornfoot, who had worked for Wilks, gave evidence that Wilks’s scraper was a foot shorter.

John Hedley Lomman & Charles Lomman also gave supporting evidence.

The SM said he disbelieved all the defendant had said and the corroborative evidence as well and fined him £20 with £3-0-0 costs or three months in default.

Obituary. Thomas Rosewall died 11 January at his residence in Paxton Terrace aged 84. Born at St Ann, Cornwall [Perhaps St Ann’s Chapel?] 19 July 1834 and arrived at Port Adelaide 4 July 1847. He came to Burra and worked in the Burra Creek at one of the ‘jiggers’ and then at the Princess Royal Mine and later at the Carculta [Karkulto/Karkulta] Mine at Black Springs, where most of his family was born. He was a long-time member of the Aberdeen Lodge MUIOOF. Mrs Rosewall died in 1889. He is survived by four sons and two daughters: John, Josiah & Thomas of Kooringa & Henry of Boulder, WA, Mrs T. Sampson of Boulder & Miss D. Rosewall of Kooringa. There are several grandchildren. [Thomas Rosewall died 11 January 1919 Kooringa.]

Obituary. Mrs Eliza Talbot died at the residence of her daughter, Mrs A. Patterson, at Kooringa aged 95. She was born at Froxfield, Wiltshire in 1824 and migrated with her husband, Thomas, and two children in 1854. She lived at Booborowie until old age forced her to come to Kooringa. Mr Talbot died several years ago. Four children survive: Mr David Talbot of Hallett, Mrs J. Blight of Hallett, Mrs M. Morrison and Mrs A. Patterson.

Burra Hospital Board.

Charge-nurse Cranston has left, having received a military call.

The mortuary roof needs mending and the interior painting.

The Board agreed to accept soldiers at 7/- a day, all included.

The Chief-Secretary wants plans and specifications of the proposed electric light scheme before any expenditure is incurred.

Mr Warnes moved the agreement with the Local Board of Health to treat infectious cases for 30/- a week be annulled. In 1916 the cost for special nurses for infectious cases was £39-15-0, in 1917 £28 and in 1918 £87-10-0. Receipts were £14-14-8, which resulted in a loss of £141-9-8 for nursing alone and with other costs this would rise to between £200 & £250.

Mr Radford thought the Government should pay as the loss is caused by poor people and is mostly due to the shortage of nurses [which in turn had much to do with nurses being called up for military duty].

Mr McLaren moved that legal opinion be obtained as to whether they could charge patients able to pay full fees and charge the Local Board of Health for poor patients.

Mr Warnes thought they could not in conscience charge £3-3-0 a week to stay in ‘that oven which is called the isolation ward’.

Eventually it was decided to seek legal advice and defer action till then.

Miss Kate Williams is to be appointed charge-nurse.

Probationers were being paid 5/- a week in the first year and 2/6 more each subsequent year. Mr Warnes said these were starvation wages and moved that the rates at other hospitals be obtained. Carried.

Tpr Charles Bartholomaeus & Tpr Tom Fuller are in Colombo on their way home. They, along with Pte G. Evans & Pte J.H. Knevitt are returning to Australia on the Leicestershire which departed Cairo on 23 December and is expected in Melbourne 22 January.

Pte Arthur Lihou, former POW, arrived in London on 17 December 1918.

Pte Bob Ford Pte Lisle [sic] Fuss & Pte Herbert Horner, former POWs, have also reached England.

Burra Institute AGM.

The balance sheet was signed by Mr Milner, but Mr McLaren, the second auditor, refused to do so because:

The librarian declined to give some information, specifically the names and addresses of G.E. Dane’s choral and orchestral classes and the number of books taken out by them. Also the number of meetings and average attendance of the same and the names of those attending.

He was not satisfied that the method of paying in such members’ subscriptions and paying them out again to claim the Government subsidy would meet the Institute Association’s Commissioner of Audit.

When questioned, Mr McLaren said he had no other faults to find in the statement.

The President said Mr McLaren had exceeded his duty and should have signed and then asked for an explanation of these other matters.

Mr McLaren then signed with an endorsement protesting the procedures noted above.

[Apparently 98 subscriptions at 12/- were paid in and immediately the same amount was paid out to G.E. Dane.]

Mr Dane explained that he had run classes for many years, then the Government decided to subsidise classes run by Institutes, so his classes were brought under the Institute, then the Government decided not to subsidise classes and subsequently Mr Dane had suggested making members of classes members of the Institute.

Mr Winnall had acquiesced and the committee adopted the idea.

Mr Drew said that he and Mr McLaren (then President) and Mr Winnall had drawn up the scheme and he thought it ill-became anyone to challenge a scheme he had helped to set up.

[The discussion as reported then becomes too confusing for me to follow.]

Commercial classes continued for three quarters, but had to be discontinued due to falling attendance.

Orchestral and Choral Classes have been active, but restricted due to the demands of patriotic work.

Improvements: electric lighting has been installed at a cost of £270-6-11, a move made necessary by the high cost of carbide. Parson and Robertson installed a Delco lighting plant, which has worked very well. An engine-house at the back of the building cost £16-7-0.

Steps at the side gate were altered and a rail fence erected from the ramp to the gate and a path made to the escape door.

A new piano was purchased for £130.

From January to July carbide cost £28-18-0.

From August to December kerosene, oil etc cost £5-1-2. The cost of kerosene works out at 6d per night.

This expenditure has prevented the enlargement of the hall and the erection of a verandah at the main entrance, until funds are available.

Disastrous Fire.

The biggest fire in the history of the district broke out on Friday 24 January. It covered over 30,000 acres in an area 12 miles by about 4 miles. The day was a ‘brick-fielder’ on which there was a strong hot wind raising dust. Clouds of smoke were seen in Burra about 10 a.m., followed by calls for help. Soon choking smoke enveloped the town and the fire was coming down the Copperhouse Hills and had entered Aberdeen. The sale at Elder, Smith’s Stockyards was interrupted when the fire entered the yards. In places the flames advanced at 30 m.p.h. The fire leapt the 100 yard gap of the railway quarry. It ran along Firewood Creek and was finally stopped when the wind dropped towards evening. Murkaby Dam, 40 miles away, was covered with cinders. Amazingly there was little loss of stock.

At night from hilltops it looked wonderful, if tragic, with haystacks, fences and stumps alight like an illuminated city.

The fire started at Mr J. O’Dea’s property at Booborowie and he attributes it to phosphorus from poisoned rabbits that dogs took under a haystack to eat. The phosphorus being left in the entrails that were left. Little damage occurred there, but the fire spread quickly into J. Barker’s ‘Corolinga’ and thence to A.D. McDonald’s and to E.N. Finch’s (late John Stagg’s). From McDonald’s it also crossed the road to R.J. Fairchild’s and into ‘Wildotta’ paddock, where it was split by the lagoon.

The south arm took ‘Blink Bonnie’ (rented by Henry Collins & Co.), W.H. Field’s, Mrs C. Sandland’s ‘Koonoowarra’ and thence across the road to Messrs Thomas and Gare’s & Josiah Thomas’s, cleaning up D. Bailey’s small holding. Part of this fire then ran through Copperhouse; down through Mr Austin’s paddock to Aberdeen, engulfing the showgrounds, greatly damaged Short’s and Robertson’s and went through Drew & Crewe’s woodyard, Elder, Smith’s saleyards and at Ford’s paddock went on to Firewood Creek, where it finally stopped.

The north arm travelled to M. Reilly’s, thence to J.G. Oates’s across the stock route and into E.N. Finch’s ‘Pencarrow’, across the railway line and up the hill. It continued through E.N. Finch’s ‘Wandillah’. From ‘Coralinga’ it spread to ‘Wildotta’ across the stock road and into the forest and thence to ‘Mackerode’, where it stopped.

‘Coralinga’

There were some 3,000 sheep there. With superhuman effort the homestead was saved with the very doormat being burnt. 3,000 acres of grass were lost with just 300 acres in one corner being saved. The sheep were saved in a neighbour’s paddock – Mr Symons receiving notice to remove them before dawn.

A.D. McDonald lost 500 acres of grass and almost all his fences, but sheds and the homestead were saved.

E.N. Finch lost 2,000 acres of grass and 150 tons of hay along with the chaff house, chaff-cutting plant, sheds, etc. The implements on ‘Wandillah’ were saved, but the losses on the two properties are not less than £4,000.

Messrs Thomas & Gare lost all grass: c. 900 acres, and 150 tons of lucerne hay. The residence and sheds were miraculously saved.

R. Reed jnr lost c. 200 acres of grass – the rest of his country had been previously burnt.

W. McBride lost about 400 acres of feed and c. 25 sheep.

R.J. Fairchild lost 30 tons of hay and 500 acres of grass.

J.G. Oates. All that survives on his property is the scorched and blackened house that was somehow saved. This year he was on halves with Mr Tohl who lost c. 400 acres of feed and fencing. There was just time to save the stock. Miss Marjorie Field galloped to Mrs Oates’s assistance and released the horses. Mrs Oates and her niece, Miss Crittendon, had a lucky escape. The large forest reserve nearby was swept from end to end. Damage at Oates’s is estimated at £4,000 – little of it covered by insurance.

W. Field. They rushed from here to assist when the fire was on A.D. McDonald’s property, but the blaze came swiftly on. The Misses Therese and Marjorie Field quickly saddled horses and mustered all their stock on the fallow and gave Mr Duell on ‘Koonoowarra’ the alarm. By then the fire was on their property. W. Field galloped back, but Stan Field and Mr E. Carter had to run to ‘Monavea’. They tried to save a load of hay, but it burnt and even the woodheap was burnt. Mr Field’s haystack was a record size and was destroyed. The Misses Field several times had to beat out flames that caught their hair or clothes and W. Field fell over a burning wagon, cutting his face and fracturing his jaw. His losses are less than others as his wheat was all at Burra Station and his implements and large sheds were saved. The fire scorched the house, burning one verandah post.

Mat Reilly. All that was saved was the house, a binder, a buggy and a wheelbarrow. His pigs were roasted in their styes and nearly all Mrs Reilly’s poultry were burnt too, along with 400 bags of wheat. He is uninsured.

A.G. Gebhardt was in Adelaide and the women had hard work to save the house. With the aid of help from Mt Bryan and elsewhere the house and sheds were saved, though c. 2,500 acres of feed and all fencing was lost. The stock was saved.

‘Koonoowarra’ Here the woolshed with two years’ seed wheat, a winnower, wool tables, etc. was destroyed along with six sheep. Also lost were a calf, sheep yards, three large loads of firewood and two large haystacks valued at £300 each. The stock had been mustered and run to fallow land, which left no time to save equipment, except for some harness from the harness room. The cottage of the overseer, Mr Duell, was saved. Here even the timber lining of the well was burnt to water level. Fortunately a recent fire had burnt around the homestead allowing it and the large implement shed to be saved. Poultry was largely killed by smoke without even being singed. Damage is at least £3,000.

In fact on all holdings on the main route of the fire the fences are largely gone.

Copperhouse.

Feed was abundant here, especially in the gullies. The north arm of the fire swept the paddocks in front of Copperhouse, separated from it by only the road. With almost all the men away fighting the fire, another arm came over the Flagstaff Hills and in 10 minutes from the hill had reached Copperhouse – about three miles. Residents were almost smothered in the smoke. They managed to save all the livestock except the poultry. The shifting wind meant that the town had three visitations. Mr J. Nickles lost a binder and all his grass, fencing, poultry and a chaff-cutter, but miraculously a haystack survived.

W. Kellaway lost all grass and hay.

R. Nourse lost 20-30 tons of hay, all feed and fences.

Bob Fuss lost all his sheds, outhouses and a beautiful garden, together with a spring dray, six tons of hay, tools, tool house, poultry, poultry yards and a 2,000 gallon galvanised-iron tank. Mrs Fuss and her neighbours removed the furniture onto the road and soon the back of the house was alight, but was extinguished with hard work. He estimates his loss at £70.

Mr Lomman lost a haystack, feed, fencing and a fruit garden.

Messrs Diplock, A.E. Wise, Fisher, R. Edwards, Mrs Nieman, W. Lomman, George Parker and Mrs McDonald lost their feed, fencing and poultry.

James Reed and H. Sandland used their cars several times to bring women and children into Aberdeen. Mr John Nickles, nearly 90 and Mrs Nickles were brought in.

The fire was stopped by Messrs Stockman & Nickles’ fallow paddock, which saved Spring Bank.

Aberdeen.

Firebreaks around the Show Grounds saved most buildings, but the Tote House was razed.

In Aberdeen Mrs Austin’s piggery was lost along with her grass and haystack.

Mr W. Short had a struggle to save his house and lost sheds, garden, builder’s plant, timber, etc. and a new dray, though an old one survived. His loss is estimated at between £300 & £400.

T.F. Robertson lost a stack of hay.

Drew & Crewes lost a wood pile.

Elder, Smith & Co. lost part of their saleyards.

In Aberdeen Mrs D. Bailey, alone in her little home with three children tried to escape in a horse and cart, but was trapped. She barely got back to the house. The horse took the cart to a bare patch in the paddock and survived. Three large pigs were roasted to death along with every fowl.

The Commissioner of Public Works advises the 4” main to and from the reservoir will be replaced by 8”. It is not yet intended to enlarge the reservoir. Pipes over the Bon Accord Bridge are to be 2” wrought iron.

The RSL was given permission to take electric wires across the road to their premises.

Electric street lights have been fixed at the National Bank Corner and in the Rotunda as arranged with Messrs Lord Bros. and Humphris.

On Friday morning the Mayor ordered the fire reel to assist at fire at the Drew & Crewes store and believed that but for the reel both the wood stacks and the store would have gone: the posts on the northern approaches to the Bon Accord Bridge had been burnt.

Cr Dare said there should be a fire brigade.

The Town Clerk said he was the secretary and about the only one left of the brigade. He would endeavour to get some men together.

Scoutmaster Rigney described how when the troop was formed some three years ago they had met at the old White Hart Hotel, but this unfortunately burnt down. They had then accepted Mr E.C. Sedgman’s offer of a room at the Waterworks Department for the next two years and now through the generosity particularly of Messrs James Reed & I.J. Warnes they had their own room.

Mr Crewes in opening the building said it had cost £395. They had £200 of that and hoped before the day was ended to have raised the other £195.

After the opening a bazaar had been organised with stalls on either side of the room. Mrs I.J. Warnes declared this open and together with the promenade concert in the evening £46 was raised.

The Great District Fire Coronial Enquiry.

I.J. Warnes JP acted as coroner at the enquiry held at the Booborowie Hotel last Saturday.

The coroner was anxious to establish the cause of the fire, which started on Mr J. O’Dea’s farm. If it could be shown that rabbit poison started the fire as alleged then the Government should be approached to have its manufacture prohibited.

John Charles O’Dea, farmer of H. of Ayers.

He described the morning’s activities of 24 January. He described his discovery of the fire in his haystack and the efforts made to extinguish and then confine it. He believed the fire started about 9.30 and that dogs had brought dead rabbits to the stack and that his stallion had trodden on the entrails causing the fire. He had not used rabbit poison himself, but it had been laid on Mr Barker’s land. He had lost 12-15 tons of hay, 1⁄2 ton of super, 5 acres of grass and a few posts. He was not insured. He had no problems with his neighbours.

On the night of the fire he told Mr Symons to take Mr Barker’s sheep out of his [O’Dea’s] paddock as it was the only feed he had and they would have skinned it out.

Cross-examined he said if he had concentrated on stopping the fire spreading to ‘Coralinga’ he might have been successful, but at the cost of his own house etc. Later he admitted he had not tried to stop the fire from spreading before trying to save the stack.

Harold James O’Dea gave generally corroborating evidence, but did not know how the fire started. He had no chance to beat out the fire: it was already too strong.

Thomas Symons. The first thing done was to save the sheep. He couldn’t have stopped the fire if he had gone straight to it. He had no theory on the fire’s origin. He had no problem with the O’Deas and never knew of poisoned rabbits causing fires, but had known S.A.P. to burst into flames when open. He was sure a horse treading on entrails would not cause a fire.

Others gave inconclusive evidence.

John Williams of Hanson had laid rabbit poison. He said 2 lb of S.A.P. was mixed with 1 gallon of water and sufficient pollard to the consistency of bread dough. Friction could cause a fire in an empty S.A.P. tin when it was quite dry, but he could think of no conditions which would make the mixed poison ignite. He gave further details of his activities.

John Barker said S.A.P. had been used for 15 years and it had never caused a fire and he considered it absolutely safe. Poisoned rabbits usually died in their burrows.

The coroner then said he thought they should adjourn to get the professional opinion of Dr Hargreaves, the Government Analyst, but he would be guided by the jury.

The enquiry was then adjourned to 11 February at Redruth.

Influenza.

The Mayor sought the advice of the Central Board of Health on the holding of the Burra Races and it was suggested cancelling them if influenza was feared, but this advice came too late. Mr E. Thamm attended the races and in the evening was taken ill with pains in the head and vomiting. Dr Ashton diagnosed serious gastric influenza. The patient’s temperature was 103°F. A short time later one of the boys had similar symptoms. The cases were reported to the Central Board of Health. On Monday evening as the Thamm children had gone to school it was decided to close the town’s schools (Burra, St Joseph’s and Copperhouse). Two of the Thamm’s little girls fell ill Monday evening and yesterday three more of the family: leaving only Mrs Thamm unaffected.

The performance of The Bing Boys was cancelled on the Mayor’s order. The schools were ordered disinfected and the Institute hall was ordered disinfected on account of its possible use as an isolation hospital.

At Mt Bryan Mr A.G. Gebhardt of Mackerode seems to have caught the disease: he was at the Burra sales on Friday.

Local Board of Health.

The Chairman reported his actions [as above] to a special meeting on Tuesday at midday and his actions were endorsed. Nurse Langley was sent to Thamm’s to assist Mrs Thamm and the Thamm house is to be isolated. There is only one room for 14 cases at the hospital and the Central Board was wired for advice.

The Local Board was disgusted with the reply from Adelaide, which came too late to stop the races and offered no practical advice.

The Masonic Hall will be disinfected during the day too.

‘A Woman Subscriber’ writes suggesting that the use of the Institute as a hospital will cause a great deal of trouble in the fumigation of the library books.

Influenza.

There has been an outbreak at the Girls’ Reformatory, but fortunately the cases of all the four girls and one officer affected have been mild. The picture show on Saturday was ordered cancelled and schools have been closed for a week, but reopened on Monday as there were no fresh signs of the disease. The Central Board of Health sent to Burra the full equipment for a 20-bed hospital, which was due to arrive Monday evening.

Dr Ramsay Smith of the Central Board of Health said in an outbreak the local hospital should not be used. Military authorities would not allow the Drill Hall to be used. He would inspect the Skating Rink as a possibility. Virulent cases could spring up inexplicably among mild ones and pneumonia might develop immediately or not for 6-7 days. The school could be kept open with a 15-30 minute inspection daily by the Medical Officer.

The installation of two electric streetlights by Glenister & Sams was reported.

The Mayor asked permission to retire from the Hospital Board following what he regarded as its inappropriate behaviour re the matron’s dismissal. The Council held the view that they needed a representative on the Board regardless of his personal feelings in the matter and declined his request.

Burra Burra Hospital Board of Guardians.

The new Board met for the first time.

Mr A.J. McBride was nominated Chairman by Mr Warnes and 2nd Mr Winnall.

Mr Winnall was nominated by Mr Radford, but declined.

Mr McLaren was nominated by Mr Radford, but declined.

Mr Crewes thought Mr Radford had in mind a resident Chairman, which Mr McBride was not. Though Mr Crewes had no personal feelings in the matter, he felt a resident Chairman was preferable.

Mr Winnall did not believe in changing horses mid-stream.

Mr McBride was elected.

(Other members were Messrs Bartholomaeus, Warnes, Dane, Crewes, McLaren, Radford, Winnall, McWaters, Dr Williams and the new members: Major L.A. Lewis & Mr Ruthven.)[[

[Mr Lane seems to have resigned.]

[The last meeting of the old Board had gone into committee to discuss certain matters, which were of course not able then to be reported in the paper. It now becomes clear that the complaints from nurses had resulted in that meeting in committee asking the Matron to resign.]

The two probationers concerned had asked to be allowed to resign and this request was granted.

Mr Winnall was against the drastic action proposed by the committee and especially in the present condition of the town [a reference to influenza]. No steps had been taken to fill vacancies generated by the decision.

Mr McWaters held that the carrying out of the decision was in Mr Winnall’s hands.

Winnall [who apparently had taken no action to implement the decision] held that the committee should also have taken action to fill the vacancy created. He was solidly against the decision to dismiss the Matron after three years of faithful service without the breath of a complaint. He was against the adoption of the minutes, which would see them implemented. He was glad that Nurse Cranston had come and gone after complaining about the Matron and her management of the hospital.

Mr Crewes & Mr McWaters held that the new members should not vote, not having heard the evidence.

Mr Winnall was determined not to have the institution’s future controlled by the word of two probationers. He said it amounted to two probationers saying that if the Matron were not dismissed they would leave: it was laughable if it had not proved tragical. [sic]

Mr Crewes thought that the probationers had proved their case.

Mr Winnall would use his last breath to see the injustice undone. Boiled down to its essentials Nurse Birdseye’s greatest complaint was a shortage of utensils.

The Matron replied that as breakages were often not reported, she did not always know of the shortages.

The other serious complaint was that the Matron, one night, refused to come and help her move a patient and the patient had to wait two hours till Nurse Hermann came on duty. Nurse Birdseye’s version of events was uncorroborated.

[Winnall then goes on a flight of fancy constructing a scenario he believed more likely to be what happened, but which is equally uncorroborated.]

After further statements by Winnall he moved that the minutes be not adopted. 2nd Warnes.

Mr McWaters considered this all a schoolboy-like action – to consider the matter carefully for two days and arrive at a decision and then come again and have all that had been done thrown to one side and not recognised. He had come ready to support the carrying out of the decision and intended to do so.

When the motion was put Ruthven, McLaren, Warnes, Winnall & Lewis were for it and Bartholomaeus, Radford, McWaters, Dane & Crewes were opposed.

Carried on the casting vote of the chair.

Mr Crewes moved that the Matron be discharged.

He was astounded that a member of the minority had planned to overthrow the decision of the majority. Why hold an enquiry at all? The business had been settled and at a subsequent meeting a decision reached was being cast out without any new evidence being brought.

Messrs Winnall & Crewes then went over the alleged incident of the 23rd when the Matron was held to have refused to aid a patient.

Mr Winnall had taken offence at the way the nurses’ letters were worded. Mr Crewes thought they were incorrectly worded through ignorance and some of their complaints were supported by charge-nurse Cranston, whom he regarded as a fine woman. He felt their actions in now not carrying out a decision of the Board would make them a laughing stock of the community.

Dr Williams was asked whether the nurse should have been able to move the patient without help and he agreed she should have been able. Mr Dane 2nd Mr Crewes.

On being put the motion was lost – the split in votes being as before.

The Matron is to be advised that the request for her resignation was withdrawn.

The Secretary of the ATNA wrote cancelling the hospital’s registration as a school for training nurses due to low patient numbers. Enquiries are to be made re the status of nurses admitted as probationers before the cancellation.

Inspector General of Hospitals is to be advised that Burra Hospital had not reduced its fees as alleged by Dr Ashton, to compete with his new private hospital.

D. Jones tender was accepted to paint the morgue.

It was advisable for all hospital staff to be inoculated for influenza.

Burra District Fire-Adjourned Inquest.

On 11 February the inquest resumed with I.J. Warnes JP as coroner.

Patrick Carmody, farmer of Leighton, gave evidence that fires on his property in November 1918 he believed to be the result of S.A.P. poison use. He had experimented and found that cloth through which S.A.P. liquid had been strained would spontaneously ignite and so would paper dipped in it. A drop splashed on his trouser leg also ignited. He had never seen poison pellets burn, but thought a rabbit’s entrails might catch fire. His experiments diluted the S.A.P. in 4 pints of water, where the instructions were for 12 pints.

Evidence was then taken from W.T. Rowe, Assistant Govt. Analyst. He had tried experiments in 1911 to get S.A.P. to cause a fire. He thought it was practically impossible for S.A.P. to cause a fire. He thought it quite safe if properly mixed, but it might be concentrated in a cloth used as a strainer, which might then ignite. The S.A.P. should not be strained before use.

Thomas Crompton, general manager for Gollen & Co., who are the agents for S.A.P., also gave evidence of its safety.

William Henry McWaters, Inspector for the Burra District Council gave evidence generally supporting S.A.P. being safe, though he though the empty tins might cause a fire.

The coroner summed up and the jury found no evidence to show how the fire started, but recommended the Government be asked to limit the use of S.A.P. to certain months of the year.

Copperhouse was disturbed the other night by an apparent tin kettling in the adjacent suburb of Westbury, but its cause is mysterious, as no wedding is known to have taken place for some months.

Burra Bowling Club.

A meeting last Thursday decided to form a bowling club. Mr C.D. Wilkinson convened the meeting. He said the idea had been discussed earlier, but shelved because of the war. Mr A.W. Gebhardt had given them an option on a piece of land adjacent to the Council Depot [Thames St]. If the Council would grant a piece of their ground this would make an ideal site c. 150’ square. Mr Gebhardt said they would need at least 50 members at £3-3-0 a year to maintain a green. Six rinks, a well, a pump etc. would be needed and would require £500 for initial expenses. A committee was appointed to report on possible sites and get estimates etc.

Mr McLaren suggested Paxton Square.

Mr Chambers suggested opposite the school on the creek bank where there were already tennis courts.

Burra Racing Club held a meeting last Friday.

The last race meeting had shown a deficit of £42 and there was a bank overdraft of £176. Outstanding subscriptions should reduce the deficit to c. £21. Guarantors for the debt were sought and obtained. Mr Tennant, the President, said a racing club that couldn’t pay its way should be wiped out. Unless matters changed he would resign. Major Lewis thought it could be made to work. A small committee was appointed to work out a rescue plan.

Burra Burra Hospital Board

Nurses Birdseye & Hermann had left the institution on 14 February. The Matron reported a patient had been taken from the isolation ward to a tent and had improved!

Tenders are to be called for renovations to the kitchen, which is in a bad state.

A letter of condolence is to be sent to the family of the late H.H. Thomas.

Messrs C. Bartholomaeus & G.E. Dane have forwarded their resignations to the Chief Secretary. Mr Dane sent a copy of his reasons to the Board, which related to the decisions taken at the last meeting.

The Repatriation Department wrote that Sister J.S. Wood, late Matron of the Burra Hospital, had returned from active service and was enquiring if she could be reinstated. The Chairman said that originally that had been the arrangement, but Sister Wood later wrote (in June 1916) that she was giving up nursing and so they had made the last appointment permanent, despite which Sister Mildred was willing to resign to allow Nurse Wood’s return. The situation as above will be communicated to the Department.

Under the circumstances of the hospital the secretary of the Australian Trained Nurses Assoc. (ANTA) thought that if a letter of explanation were sent the hospital might be reinstated for a time, but now a letter has been received from ANTA refusing such a concession while bed usage was so low. Because they had engaged nurses who would not now fulfil their requirements to get their certificates the Hospital Board felt there had been a breach of faith as ANTA had undertaken to allow the situation to go on till the end of the war. Another letter will be sent to ANTA.

Mr Warnes thought the agreement with the Local Board of Health to treat infectious patients for 30/- a week should be done away with. Each case cost the hospital £4-£5 a week and only 30/- could be claimed from the Board of Health. The debate then moved from the principle to the individual cases of the Thamms and Mr Crewes. Legal opinion from an Adelaide solicitor will be sought.

Burra Cheer-up Soc.

The Ladies’ band etc. gathered at the station on 10 March to welcome L-Cpl C. Bennett [probably C. Bennetts], Driver F. Gebhardt & Pte Ridgway.

Cricket. At Aberdeen Oval on Saturday: Burra 8 for 219 declared defeated South Booborowie 26.

Burra Town Council.

The Overseer reported on the Hampton Roads. Wellington Rd had not been formed and was very bumpy, but if gutters were cleared out and bumps attended to it would do. A watertable was needed on the South and East [sic] sides of High Street, but to make a proper road would cost £60 for about three users.

Cr Radford said Hampton produced about £4-10-0 in rates and about £3-10-0 was available for c. 60 chains of road, which would not pay for rubble for one of them. The road needed doing, but was on a hill and the first rain would wash away most of the work.

The matter was left in the hands of the North Ward Councillors.

The Postal Department said electric lamps could be placed on telephone poles for 3/- per annum.

The Bowling Club delegation waited on the Council.

They asked for 40’ adjoining the Depot in Kooringa, either purchasing it or on a 99-year lease.

An alternative site across the creek was mentioned. The Mayor said the creek site would be more central. After discussion the club was offered the 40’ requested at 15/- per foot. [£30]

Burra Show Soc. AGM

The appreciation of the Society for the work of the late H.H. Thomas was recorded.

This year a major expense was the new chicken coops. Another was the increase in prize money of £40. On the whole the President thought they were in a sound position, though they had not made any progress financially. He felt the town was not supporting the Society and had been quite absent from the dog trials. The bad weather had cost c. £20 at the gate and not enough had been paid for the publican’s booth, which was worth at least £20. Elected were

Patron Hon. J. Lewis

President I.J. Warnes

Needed improvements included lavatories.

Mr Warnes then donated £100 to offset the cost of the fowl coops. He thought that a minimum price of £25 should be put on the publican’s booth. (He said £70-£80 was paid at Jamestown.)

Black Springs Red Cross Circle held a social in the Black Springs Hall on 29 March to mark the closing of the branch after nearly four years. It had opened on 8 September 1915 and in that time had raised £551-18-0. Details of its disbursements in money and goods are given.

Burra Show Society Annual Report.

The report began with thanks for the end of the war.

Agriculturally the season began well, faltered and ended satisfactorily. The year for pastoralists was again good with a big lambing and big wool clip. Wool prices and stock prices held up. Fires had been a major down side for the year for some producers.

The loss of H.H. Thomas as a hard worker for the society who had died this year was an untimely blow.

Membership this year was 208 – up from 178.

Improvements for the year.

The biggest was the erection of 150 permanent fowl coops. The show ring was moved to the north of the permanent ring, making it more central and giving an opportunity for events to be seen from traps and cars.

The sheep show was a dismal failure with only one competitor.

The dog trial was a great success.

The general show on 22 October was very successful despite being unpleasantly windy.

Financially the Society began the year £70in credit and ends it £30 in debt.

The Burra Brass band aided the show by its presence and thanks was also extended to the ladies who assisted, especially those of the Soldiers’ Aid Soc. For the luncheon and afternoon tea. Thanks also to the Boy Scouts and the committee.

The Burra Bowling Club has accepted the land offered to them at 15/- per foot.

H.A. Harrop [sic – presumably T.A. Harrap] applied for a licence for a pie-cart stand in Market Square. Cr Dane said Mr Halls used the place for that purpose – request allowed at the Council’s pleasure.

He worked at the Kapunda Mine and then the Burra Mine before taking land at Mongolata, but this failed through the drought and he became a Home Missionary for the Methodist Church in the circuits of Hanson, Strathalbyn and Callington, having long been a local preacher, class leader, office bearer and Sunday school superintendent. Unable to make long journeys at last he settled at Wallaroo Mines in 1888 and continued there till he retired. He has been blind for the last ten years, but is otherwise in good health. Of his children the survivors are: Mrs James Wilson (Peterborough), Mrs J. Lomman (Unley), Miss C.L. Paull (Broken Hill) & Mrs F. Potter (Kadina). There are 11 grandchildren and 1 great grandchild.

Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial Hall v. a Soldiers’ Monument. Last Thursday a meeting was held to elect two representatives to attend a further district meeting to resolve the question. About 20 attended and E.W. Crewes took the chair. The Mayor said he had for some years advocated a memorial for fallen soldiers. At the last meeting held it had been unanimously decided to erect a memorial of some kind in Market Square and that was generally accepted till a few weeks ago and he had received many promises of support. Recently the RSL had sent invitations to the District Councils to send delegates to consider erecting a memorial hall in Burra. The Town Council had not been invited and even after discussing the omission with the secretary of the RSL no invitation had been received. The Mayor was given to understand that the proposed hall would cost c. £7,000. The RSL had accommodation that, though not good enough, would serve for the time being and he did not like to see division on the matter. He had called this meeting to appoint delegates to meet others from the district to reach a final decision. It would be thought to be folly to erect a building costing £7,000 that would need a caretaker otherwise the upkeep would be heavy.

W.D. Thompson, secretary of the RSL explained that the calling of the meeting short circuited extending an invitation to the Town Council. The returned men felt they had a right to put forward a proposal if they so chose. Their proposal was to erect a memorial hall for c. £6,500, not a hall for entertainment or meetings. Each district would have a bay in the hall for war trophies and memorial tablets and perhaps some guns in the central space. The League was trying to win, but not to force the people’s hands. Two plans were being considered.

A large hall with shop front and arcade with residential quarters and overhead offices with the rents to pay for the upkeep.

A hall with bays and lawns in front at a smaller cost.

Cr Radford was sympathetic to the League, but felt it had erred in not inviting town delegates. He thought the hall very ambitious and in 40-50 years the returned men would not be here. Adelaide had only raised c. £6,500 for a hall.

The Mayor said delegates had already resolved on erecting a Market Square memorial.

Cr Radford thought they had agreed to erect something in Burra.

Mr Sara said if the Mayor is correct then no further delegates are needed.

The mayor said the previous meeting had directed delegates to hold local meetings and he was to hold one in Burra. This meeting should appoint two delegates and instruct them to vote one way or the other.

Mr Thompson favoured the memorial hall, which would be more like a museum, not a meeting hall and he said he already had one promise of £1,000. He moved the meeting support a hall. 2nd Mr Lott. Mr McLaren moved a further public meeting be called.

The Mayor could see no reason for a second meeting – this one had been sufficiently advertised.

Mr Winnall thought it beyond reason to ask the district to support a £6,500 museum of no utility, which would cost a lot to maintain.

Mr Thompson said the League would support anything decided by the district. He could not say it would do so for this meeting alone.

Cr Radford thought the meeting could not instruct the delegates how to vote.

Mr Ruthven said there was no use appointing them if the meeting couldn’t instruct them.

In response to a question the Mayor said the monument was expected to cost c. £1,500.

The Mayor & Mr Winnall were elected delegates.

Mr Thompson moved the meeting adjourn to a date fixed to ensure a full public meeting.

Mr Winnall said if Mr Thompson’s motion was lost the question would be settled in favour of a monument as that is the position of the Mayor and himself.

The resolution was put and lost.

Memorial to Fallen Soldiers.

A meeting at Mt Bryan on 9 May was chaired by I.J. Warnes, Chairman of the Mt Bryan District Council.

Mr Warnes said the first meeting at Leighton had called on the Mayor of Burra to convene a meeting of delegates to consist of two from each DC and two from the Town Council. They had all heard a lot of what Burra had done and it had always taken credit, not the district. It had taken the money and decided what to do with it. The suggested meeting was held on 18 December, but it was not a meeting of delegates. Instead the whole Town Council was there and other residents beside. Though the residents left, the Town Council and members of the Burra DC stayed. All that was decided was that:

A suitable monument is to be erected in Burra by Burra & District.

The Corporation of Burra and each DC is to appoint two delegates to form an executive committee.

The Burra town meeting last week had voted for a monument in Market Square.

The RSL had asked for a meeting of delegates to hear their scheme at a meeting in their rooms. The scheme was put by Mr Thompson. They could please themselves if they wanted to join Burra (Voices of: ‘We don’t.’) or do something for their own district. (Voices: ‘We will.’) As far as Mt Bryan was concerned there was a proposal to add two rooms in front of the District Hall. (A library and a billiard room.) It was suggested the £240 to provide work for returned soldiers be so used.

Mr W.D. Thompson then put forward the RSL scheme for a museum hall as outlined in last week’s Record.

Mr Beaglehole thought any local trophies could go in the rooms on the Mt Bryan Hall and not to Burra.

Mr Quinn would do something at Mt Bryan first and then support Burra afterwards.

There was an awkwardly worded motion, the effect of which was to put Mt Bryan first.

Mr Warnes called on the meeting to think carefully – they couldn’t go to Burra without giving and if they tied themselves hard and fast to Mt Bryan they would be solely on their own.

The motion was then altered to put Mt Bryan first and then if they liked the Burra scheme, they would help them afterwards.

The motion was carried 9 to 1. [This figure seems surprisingly low, given that the report also says about 50 people attended, but subsequent proceedings suggest that some 40 abstentions might have occurred. The proceedings are not very clear, as the next paragraph says the motion was then withdrawn to enable a new one to be put.]

Mr Beaglehole then moved that Mt Bryan supported a local scheme and this time there were 30 for, 1 against and 21 abstentions.

Mr A. Pledge moved the memorial take the form of two rooms on the front of the hall. 2nd Mr Beaglehole.

Mr Warnes assured them the DC would not object if they could raise the money. Carried.

A committee was appointed and the building is to be called the Mt Bryan Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial

Influenza.

Local Board of Health, Monday, ordinary meeting.

Dr Lyndon attended in place of Dr Williams, who had influenza.

The secretary E.J. Davey reported that the telephone had been connected to the Isolation Hospital (The Boy Scout Room).

Mr Crewes said he had spoken to Dr Ramsay Smith when the outbreak began. He had expected to receive instructions by telephone, but got none. He had received a wire asking for a report and had replied by wire, but still got no response. The Board had then met and on Dr Williams’s advice had decided to close the schools and use the Burra School as an Isolation Hospital. Mr Hitchcox refused to close the school unless instructed by the Minister of Education. Mr Crewes then wired Dr R. Smith who asked if the Medical Officer wanted the schools closed. Dr Williams was by then ill, but Dr Steele had arrived home and after consulting with Dr Williams it was decided not to close the schools. Dr Smith then wired asking who had authorised the Town Clerk to ask the Mayor of Peterborough to send Central Board of Health equipment to Burra. Dr Smith was sending equipment for beds without blankets or sheets, which patients should supply.

Dr Williams reported the first case of pneumonic influenza on Sunday 11 May. He was taken ill the following day, but Dr Steele had arrived. Dr Steele selected the Scout Hall as the best Isolation Hospital.

Dr Smith sent a Matron to take charge and a VAD to assist and an orderly.

Cr McBride was somewhat annoyed at not being involved, but no one seems to have known that he arrived in town on the Tuesday and the Board had also believed Cr Bartholomaeus to be away, when he was actually available. He wondered why the Burra Hospital was not being used, but isolation problems there were explained.

The medical Officer said 10 cases, 3 serious, had been reported.

Dr Steele said serious cases should go to hospital and mild ones be treated at home.

There was some considerable discussion about where patients could and/or should have been treated.

Cr McBride was clearly annoyed at not having been involved and that there was little in the way of written records of what had been done.

[It should also be remembered that he was Chairman of the Burra Hospital Board.]

Dr Smith had stopped the movement of equipment from Peterborough. The Town Clerk thought Dr Smith, or Ramsay Smith as he called himself, had behaved unfairly.

The Town Clerk is to write for the loan of the Peterborough equipment – there have so far been no cases since the initial outbreak.

The Minister of Education had written to say the Department was anxious to assist, but would not do so under compulsion.

Burra Hospital reported three cases of influenza there.

Messrs Dring & Medwell, relatives of the late Mrs Medwell formed a deputation complaining that:

The home where Mrs Medwell had been had not been fumigated, though there were three small children in it.

Neither had it been isolated.

Mrs Medwell had been sent to a cold, barn-like place without a ceiling.

Mr Medwell was in the same place still.

The Isolation Hospital ‘was a den and highly discreditable to an important town and to remove a woman in Mrs Medwell’s condition to such a place seemed to him inhuman.’

The sanitary conditions in the neighbourhood of where his son lived were abominable and should have been supervised.

The ambulance was popularly known as ‘The Freezer’ and Mrs Medwell was moved without stockings or a blanket.

Dr Lyndon said heaters had been put in and professional nursing was the patient’s only hope.

Mr Dring suggested a bagging ceiling might at least prevent condensation from dripping from the roof onto patients.

Cr Dane moved all infected houses be fumigated at once and all possible be done re the ceiling.

Despite the risks Dr Lyndon said he favoured using the Burra Hospital, but pointed out he was only Dr Steele’s locum until next Friday.

Cr Bartholomaeus and Cr McBride moved to get part of the hospital set aside as the Isolation Hospital if the Hospital Board was willing.

Dr Lyndon thought if they were prepared to risk spreading the infection it was worth the risk.

Cr McBride was sure the Board would be. Passed unanimously.

Burra Cheer-up Soc.

On 13 May the Ladies’ band etc. was at the station to welcome Sgt Major C. Wiltshire, whose parents recently moved to Burra.

On 14 May the Ladies’ band etc. met the train to welcome home Courtney Pearce, Albert Bruce and Alan Bertram.

Ptes Carpenter & Fuss returned during the week, but evidently preferred no welcome should take place. [The Fuss was probably Lyall.]

Burra Hospital Board, meeting on Tuesday.

Dr Steele advised he would resume practice on 1 June.

The Board agreed to pay Matron £23-18-6, which had not been paid during her illness.

The Chief Secretary asked for suggestions to fill the five vacancies caused by resignations.

Mr Crewes said he had been given to understand a member of the Board had been going around trying to persuade people to allow themselves to be nominated, which was improper until the Board received the letter.

Mr Winnall took offence ‘if it refers to me’.

After a little fencing Mr Crewes said it was Mr Winnall.

The latter said it was common practice to sound out potential members and he had done so before the letter from the Chief Secretary had been written and had not tried to persuade anyone.

Mr Crewes then withdrew his remark in connection with the letter, since Mr Winnall assured the meeting he did not know about it, but not his remarks about interviewing residents.

Sister Carter, late of Wallaroo Hospital was appointed Matron and Miss Cain of Adelaide was appointed Charge-Nurse.

Football. At Victoria Park on Saturday: Kooringa 3.13 (31) defeated Mt Bryan 0.1 (3).

At Hallett on Saturday: Aberdeen defeated Hallett easily. [No scores are given.]

Sister Leonard answers criticisms of the Isolation Hospital.

When she was interviewed the Isolation Hospital was without patients.

We found the hospital comparatively comfortable. The walls are grey rather than white; otherwise it looked very like any hospital ward. A canvas ceiling has been put in place; otherwise it was like it was when the patients were taken in. The hall was cut off by a partition. Beds were of a good type (better than those at the Exhibition Isolation Hospital in Adelaide). Blankets were new and adequate. The building was airy, which is good for pneumonia patients. The ceiling had never dripped on patients. As for the transfer of Mrs Medwell: Nurse Miriam Pearce had been sent with the ambulance. Mrs Medwell was wrapped in four blankets and a rug and placed on a mattress in the ambulance with hot water bottles at her feet. The alternative story was gossip started in Aberdeen for unknown reasons and there are independent witnesses to the truth. The staff at the Isolation Hospital are Matron Leonard, Nurse Miriam Pearce, Nurse Birdseye and Miss Robin VAD, an orderly and a cook. There are stoves for heat and several armchairs and deck chairs. Matron and the nurses are accommodated in tents. Once the hospital is properly organised Matron Leonard will probably be recalled.

M.A. Radford writes objecting to some of the phrases used by F.H. Collins in his correction of the cricket report of a ‘draw’ recently. He finds some phrases rather strange and had one not know the writer to be a ‘sport’ they may have taken offence. He in turn corrects Collins’s use of ‘Kooringa’ instead of Burra as the team name.

N. Hiles Pearse writes re the Mt Bryan meeting about the Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial. He was struck by the undercurrent of selfishness permeating the meeting. He protests (as a brother of a fallen soldier) at the callous and unfriendly tone towards the Mayor and citizens of Burra. That there were broadminded and unbiased people present is shown by the 21 abstentions. It is time to cease eternal wranglings and bickerings and get down to commonsense. If Mr Warnes has announced all connection with Burra and their Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial ‘he will, to be consistent (and consistency is most essential to one basking in the rays of the public lime-light) withdraw from the various positions which he holds in connection with the town; for, if the Burra dead are unworthy of consideration, the living, many of whom are flesh and blood with the boys who have “gone West”, must, in his opinion, be ignoble and beneath contempt. This is of course merely a surmise. Mr Warnes jeers at Mr Crewes for “what Burra has done”. The writer may, of course, be of lower mental calibre than Mr Warnes, for he (the writer) feels proud to be associated with a man of Mr Crewes’ ability and organising acumen, and with a town like Burra . . . All honour to Mr Crewes and the Burra people, their record is probably unsurpassed in the Commonwealth.’

Burra and district must in a case like this be synonymous. Anyone with horse sense will admit that the big central memorial should be at Burra. If the outside districts each desire their own memorial well and good, let them have them, but surely they will be public spirited enough to support a central one too. [The writer then calls on all to forego petty differences and meanness and take a broader outlook.] One cannot but pay tribute to the Mayor, the wonderful girls of the Cheer-up Society, the Burra Athletic & Sporting Club and all the other organisations, district and otherwise, for their true patriotism. We can only succeed in taking a wider, more charitable view of things ‘by eliminating the hydra-headed demon of selfishness; and not by shouting gaily from the housetops about scattering largess disinterestedly, while all the time our little “axe to grind” is very obviously protruding from our pocket.’

L.H. Foote writes to correct the accusations made about the transfer of Mrs Medwell to the Isolation Hospital. He repeats the information supplied by the Matron, but he endorses the view of the place as cold. He said he called the ambulance ‘a wind shoot’ and the Isolation Hospital ‘The Freezer’. He continues to say that taking someone from a warm home to a cold store was inhuman and senseless, when the house was neither quarantined nor fumigated. Conditions have since been improved, but at the time of the Medwell case were shameful.

Obituary. A memorial service was held for William Stephen Pengelly Thomas on 18 May. He was born in Aberdeen 51 years ago. His father was a pioneer of the district. Will attended Stanton’s Grammar School and was one of five brothers, three of whom survive him, as does his father at 82. As a boy he worked with his father at Banbury and was converted in the old church under Rev. C. Tresise. [Is this a reference to the original Mt Bryan East Church or the old Mt Bryan Church?] Soon afterwards he went to the far north and into Queensland, before finally getting work at the Broken Hill Smelters, where he contracted lead poisoning. He married Miss Howe at the Bible Christian Manse there. He also worked for the same smelting company at Port Adelaide and Port Pirie – in total for 181⁄2 years. More recently he returned to the family at Mt Bryan East, but in a very poor state of physical and mental health. In his final months he found solace in God. He leaves a wife, two sons and a daughter. [Born William Steven Thomas 17 March 1866 Redruth: died William Stephen Pengelly Thomas 23 March 1919 Mt Bryan East.]

Empire Day was celebrated at Burra School on 23 May. Speakers included Rev. G.K. Haslam, M.A. Radford, J.E.H. Winnall, and J. McLaren (Chairman of the School Committee), after which a half-day holiday was granted.

Obituary. John Turner died last Sunday [1 June] at his residence in Railway Terrace Aberdeen from dropsy. [See correction next issue.] He was born at Linkinhorne, Cornwall in June 1849 and came to Australia in 1871. On coming to Burra he worked for the late Mr R. Ward of Kooringa and later went farming at Douglas before managing Shafton Estate for the late Thomas Cockrum. He then went into partnership with Mr John Sleeman at ‘Blink Bonnie’ for twenty years. Of late he has been employed by Messrs Drew & Crewes and has been widely held in high esteem. He was a member of the Redruth Methodist Church and MUIOOF. He married Miss Pearce of Ironmine who survives. There are two surviving sons and two daughters: Tpr Jack Turner in Egypt, Dick Turner on the E-W Railway, Miss Rita Turner & Miss Gladys Turner. Another son Pte H. Turner is missing in action, presumed dead in Germany. [Died 16 Apr. 1917 as POW.]

Lieut. Ian Macindoe, well known in Burra, passed through Adelaide last week on his way to Victoria, but expects to return to SA soon.

Pte Howard West writes from Cairo, where he is engaged in the War Records Section copying medical diagrams and graphs etc.

W.G. Hawkes writes expressing his concern at attempts by some to weaken efforts for a central expression of their obligation to honour fallen soldiers. ‘Any pride and importance it [Burra] possesses is well known to be due to, and shared by, its rich and prosperous surroundings. The setting up of rivalries or jealousies is deplorable in any case, but on such a solemn undertaking as I write, is most reprehensible.’

He goes on to say that the memorial he feels should be, as said by another high official, a district shrine ‘with a sense of detachment which would arrest and focus the attention of the vastness of the national sacrifices’. No utilitarian buildings could have such an appeal and war museums preserving the horrors and the material ingenuities of war would not perpetuate the nobler memories ‘or the spiritual ideals which have justified the war and its sacrifices’.

He goes on to support a monument, but wonders if a quieter, but nearby spot, might not be more suitable than Market Square. As a postscript he says since writing he has read Mr N. Hiles Pearse’s excellent contribution and agrees with that gentleman’s tribute to the patriotism of Burra war workers led by the worthy Mayor.

Burra Town Council.

A building application by J.A. Riggs was approved.

The Commissioner of Public Works does not approve a telephone for the Waterworks.

A letter of complaint will be sent concerning the Post Office cutting out the night delivery.

Local Board of Health.

Mr Bartholomaeus asked for the letter from the Town Clerk requesting a portion of the hospital be used as an isolation block for influenza cases to be read.

The letter asked for terms and conditions and Cr McBride said it went beyond the terms of the authorising motion and wished to know why.

The Mayor considered the words of the motion ‘steps be taken’ gave sufficient latitude.

Cr Dane supported the Mayor.

The Burra Hospital Board has decided that it would be inadvisable to grant the request.

One case of influenza has been reported.

The Isolation Hospital is without patients, so the cook and orderly have been discharged, but the two nurses have been retained for two or three weeks. The Matron & VAD are employed by the Central Board. Matron and Nurse Pearce are currently nursing at private homes. The place has been made quite comfortable. The last patient was discharged 22 May.

Mr McBride moved that the Central Board be so advised and that only one case of influenza had since been reported. Carried.

The Mayor said no arrangements had been made about rent. Possibly the Scouts would take over the improvements. Cr Sampson would accept a substitute in lieu of the iron.

A letter of sympathy was sent to the Inspector in his illness.

The Naval Band was prevented by influenza from playing and the Military Band had duty at Outer Harbour, so the Ladies’ band carried most of the musical portion of the ceremonies and did it very well. In the afternoon its members were invested with war service stripes by the Military Commandant at the Cheer-up Hut. There were present about 1,000 interstate troops en route for home from the transport Devanha. The President [of what? Mr Crewes?] introduced the Band and recounted its service, especially in greeting returning soldiers at the station. Brigadier-General Antrill made the presentation.

The badge comprises a representation in blue on a white ground of a pair of wings and a stripe for each year of service. Mr G.E. Dane of the Burra Cheer-up Soc. responded for the Band.

Those receiving stripes for three years’ service were:

Misses Trix Pearce, Ethel James, Thelma Harris, Dorothy Harris, Edith Harris, Lily Riggs, Delcie McWaters, Myrtle Isaac, Gladys Lawn, Pearl Pressick, Doreen Pressick, Hazel Pressick, Nell Pearce, Hilda Hunt, Jessie Hunt, Annie Pearce, Olive Hopgood & Mrs L.R. Clarke.

Stripes for two years’ service went to:

Miss Dorothy Pederson.

Stripes for one year’s service went to:

Misses Isabel Bevan, Marjorie Riggs, Melva Burns, Vera Pascoe, Hilda Kellock & Mrs R. McNeill.

The Ladies’ band etc. met the train last Friday and welcomed Lieut. Bob Cock & Seaman ‘Wibby’ Vivian. Lieut. Cock has been away almost five years.

On Saturday the Ladies’ band and a crowd gathered to meet five returning men, but were pleased when seven turned up: Tpr-Dvr A. Hopcraft, & Troopers W. Lines, C. Rabbich, S. Priess, C. Turner, A. Brandt & W. Brown. (The last being the 5th Brown brother to return.)

On Monday evening the Ladies’ band and others greeted the return of: Tpr W.R. Edwards (of Copperhouse), & Ptes S. Jones, J. Highett & W. Hunt. (The last named arrived, but silently vanished.)

‘Amicus’ writes calling for a calm and reverent approach to a war memorial as befits the subject. The writer is not against halls, but feels that in addition some memorial devoted just to those who fell is also called for, one spot where each year we can place our wreaths and remember the sacrifice.

‘A Returned Soldier’ writes expressing disgust at Mr McLaren’s suggestion that a place to feast is a suitable memorial for the sacrifices made. The remarks of ‘Esperanto’ he dismisses as an insult to a man’s intelligence and says most returned men support the Mayor’s idea of a monument in Market Square.

E.W. Crewes writes concerning the Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial. He stresses that right from the start he had been supporting a memorial/statue to perpetuate and honour the memory of the fallen. A letter asking the District Councils to appoint delegates for a meeting resulted in only the Burra and Booborowie delegates attending. The Burra DC agreed to join in. Booborowie has decided to erect a hall, but said we could expect some help from the people there. Mt Bryan said they had also decided to erect a hall and so cannot join in. I am given to understand that Hanson and Apoinga are prepared to do what they can to help. I can hardly believe that any district would like to see a statue erected in Market Square and have the names of boys who fell belonging to that district omitted from the memorial. The idea is to have a panel for each district. I cannot conceive of a statue being erected unless it contained all the names. A time has come for a start to be made and I appeal for donations and respectfully request the acknowledgement of the same in the Record. Peace Day on or about 4 August will be a day for a special appeal for the memorial.

J. Allen writes explaining how he came to contact Mr Hall, thinking he had some standing in Peterborough football circles.

Burra Boy Scouts will not have a general meeting on Thursday, but patrol leaders and corporals will meet at the troop room to hang pictures etc.

The Ladies’ band had a miserable start to Adelaide Violet Day on 20 June. The day in Burra was cold and wet and the train ran 11⁄2 hours late, not reaching Adelaide till 11.30 a.m., but there the weather was perfect. The band had, unexpectedly and unrehearsed, to play at the Anzac Arch at noon, as the Naval Band was unable to do so due to influenza among them. Then came a luncheon at the Cheer-up Hut. At 1.45 p.m. Major Cooke-Russell led the band up King William St and back to Bowman’s Arcade, where a number was played while the public threw money onto a flag some soldiers were carrying. On turning from King William St towards the Cheer-up Hut they were greeted by hundreds of interstate soldiers who were passing through Adelaide. The girls then crowded into the Hut along with hundreds of soldiers, to be presented with service stripes by Brigadier-General Antrill. Afternoon tea followed, after which there was another parade, this time combined with the Military Band – mounted police being needed to clear a way through the traffic.

Burra Boy Scouts appear to be back in the Troop Room and resuming normal activities.

Peace Thanksgiving Service was held last Sunday in the Institute. The hall was packed for the united service with many returned men in uniform occupying the reserved seats at the front. The cold, wet, boisterous weather caused a move to the hall from the planned meeting in Market Square. E.W. Crewes, Mayor, presided. On the platform were Rev. H.H. Hopton (Anglican), Rev. D.B. Bridgwood & Rev. G.K. Haslam (Methodist), Capt. Hammitt (Salvation Army) and the Burra Cheer-up Ladies’ band conducted by G.E. Dane. Thanksgiving services were also held in the local churches.

Violet Day was celebrated in Burra on Friday 4 July in perfect weather. A large number of wreaths and emblems were hung on the Rotunda. A memorial service was held at 3 p.m. when a large crowd had gathered at the Rotunda. A returned soldiers’ procession was headed by Lieutenants R. Cock & V. A. Riggs with the Cheer-up Ladies’ band.

Adelaide Criminal Sittings

Annie Jordan was charged with the murder of an infant child at Kooringa on 9 April. She pleaded not guilty. The Crown Prosecutor presented no evidence beyond what depositions were taken at the inquest.

The Judge then said he did not believe there to be a prima facie case because:

There was no evidence as to how the deceased got into the pit.

There was no proof that the death was not from natural causes.

The Crown Prosecutor said he was prepared to enter a nolle prosequi.

When Mr Shierlaw proceeded to deal with one aspect of the evidence His Honour ordered the instant release of the prisoner.

He said he hoped the legislature would at once take steps to prevent capital charges against unfortunate girls in the position of the accused.

Burra Town Council

A letter from C. Grow offering to accept £100 for 156 feet of land in connection with the Black Bridge: the present road to become his property. Not accepted.

[This doesn’t sound right. Logically it should refer to Deadman’s Bridge on Ayers St.]

Burra Bowling Club applied for 60’ of land on the east side of the green – the idea being to plant trees there. They were granted a 21-year lease at a peppercorn rent, from the southern boundary of the Council Depot block to the bridge.

The Town Clerk was granted 10/- a week for doing the work of the Inspector during the latter’s illness.

Cr McBride called for the Town Clerk’s duties to be defined, as he thought it was a full-time job, but it appeared he was there only two days.

Mr Grow is to be interviewed and asked for the option for one month at £50 of the land offered by him.

Local Board of Health.

The Town Clerk reported the Isolation Hospital had been dismantled.

The Burra Hospital Matron had taken charge of the blankets etc. and local storekeepers had taken some stuff back. Some £30 worth of material had been stored at the depot. A statement of the whole cost of the operation is to be prepared for next meeting.

The acting inspector is to be paid £2 a month.

Cr McBride objected to the nurses attached to the Isolation Hospital working in private homes. This nursing should have been at the Isolation Hospital, whose costs, borne by the Board, were ongoing while the patients contributed nothing and had the nurses at home.

Mr Crewes said the nurses’ fees would be recovered for the Board.

Cr McBride said there was no occasion for them to be idle: there was enough work in Adelaide.

Mr Crewes: the Isolation Hospital was closed as soon as the Medical Officer thought it safe.

Peace Day Meeting, Burra last Wednesday.

All motions carried at the previous meetings were rescinded and new motions carried:

New appointees to the Board: Messrs Wheare, Chambers, Martin, Humphrys & Sampson.

Dr Steele applied for an increase of salary from £75 to £120, as he was now the only medical officer now at the hospital, though he would always welcome sharing duties. Proposed and carried.

There were presently over 20 patients in the hospital.

The Board will try to get the rules changed to allow two doctors to be engaged and are anxious to put the past problems with Dr Ashton behind them.

Obituary. Charles Vivian Ewins, eldest son of Mr & Mrs W.J.C. Ewins of ‘Kilburn’ Kooringa had died from pneumonia at Crystal Brook on Monday 14 July aged 20. He was born at Kooringa 21 January 1899. After leaving school he had been employed at the local post office and then with Dalgety’s & Co. until his death. When Dalgety’s closed their Burra office he transferred to Pt Pirie and then to Crystal Brook, where he was acting-manager. He was well known in musical circles as a pianist and vocalist.

‘Returned Soldier’ writes concerning D.W. Thompson’s claim that returned men favour a memorial hall. There were only a dozen members at the meeting and he may speak for those, but the writer claims to speak for the majority, who favour the monument.

I.J. Warnes writes to advise that at the recent meeting at Mt Bryan he said he held 14 or 15 public appointments – the more correct number would be 28 or 30.

‘Another Returned Soldier’ writes seeking the number of returned men voting at the meeting referred to by W.D. Thompson and believing it is up to the public how to honour the gallant dead.

‘The Mt Bryan Correspondent’ writes apologising for the accidental omission of the Mt Bryan East performers from his report.

Soldiers’ Aid Soc. 4th AGM

This coming year there will be no general appeal for funds, but rather energies will be devoted to care of the sick and wounded in hospitals – a need which will be long term.

Meetings in the past year had from 20 to 50 attending with an average c. 25.

At the last AGM Mesdames Thamm & Hilditch presented a crocheted quilt, which brought in c. £50 at auction on the bugler system.

In September the luncheon at the Sheep Dog Trials raised £43-8-6, which we gave to Red Cross.

At the Show we provided luncheon and afternoon tea and, together with the sale of a bullock donated to us by Mr I.J. Warnes, we raised £140-12-5.

The next fundraiser was the Jubilee Hall Bazaar in December, which raised £52-10-3.

Sheep farmers have donated wool: T. Pearce & Sons £11-13-9, G. Gallagher £3-19-10, James Reed £22-19-11 and some money is still to come in on two of these accounts.

The major disbursement was 100 Christmas boxes, £5 to the Salvation army, £25 to French Red Cross, £20 to Australia Day, £20 to Red Cross Produce Depot, a table for the RSL Room, 2 beds to Soldiers’ Hostel, £36-16-0 to Red Cross, £100 to YMCA (just after last year’s balance sheet) & £25 this year.

XXXXI, 28, 16 July 1919, Supplement

Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial Meeting, Mt Bryan 4 July, attended by c. 60-70 people and chaired by I.J. Warnes. Minutes of the previous meeting were read and confirmed.

The Chairman said since the last meeting the committee had met twice. Plans had been prepared and were at this meeting. There were to schemes to be put to the meeting. The committee recommends the one with two rooms in front of the present hall, separated by a passage. To the left is a large room to hold two billiard tables. On the right is a reading room and alongside it the memorial room to hold records and souvenirs of the fallen soldiers and for that alone.

The question tonight is whether this is the right thing or not.

Mr Warnes had no exact costing, but estimated it at not less than £1,000 to £1,200, plus furnishing costs of c. £200-£300. He thought that sum within the means of the community.

One possibility was to issue debentures as the Burra show Committee did for its refreshment room.

Another scheme is that one man has agreed to put up £100 if six others will match him.

Mr A. Jeffries thought the plans too ambitious and a 29’ passage to the hall unacceptable.

Mr Beaglehole said the plan allowed for incorporation of a cloak room. The hall measured 9’6” x 7’6”.

Mr Pledge didn’t see a problem – consider the entrance to the Adelaide Town Hall – upstairs and around corners.

Chair to Mr Gregurke – Do you think as Mr Jefferies it should be curtailed? – It is 32” x 33’6”.

The one thing to be sure of is to make it large enough and not to change it in a short time. When we built the hall we built a small place and within two years pulled it down and put up a proper place.

[This would seem to be a reference to Leighton Hall, rather than to the Mt Bryan Institute.]

[The discussion is hard to follow in the report as printed and the two plans seem to be being discussed without the second one being reported and without it being clear which one is being talked about at any given time.]

Eventually the committee’s report was adopted.

Mrs Hatherly had some concern about the voting and abstentions, but the Chair had nothing but contempt for abstentions.

There was a proposal before the committee that anyone who donated £100 be entitled to put a tablet in the hall to the memory of a fallen soldier. Whether the donor’s name should also appear seems not to have been settled.

Mr Jefferies moved the method of raising the money be left to the committee. Carried.

Mr Warnes then entered into an explanation of what had taken place in the lead-up to this meeting and made a response to the various writers to the Record, particularly the letters of Mr Pearse and Mr Hawkes.

There was a meeting at Market Square at which the Mayor invited the Chairmen of the District Councils to decide what scheme for a memorial would suit Burra and District. When the meeting was held delegates decided they would go back to their districts and hold public meetings. At the first public meeting I called only some 8 or 9 attended on a very wet night. The meeting was adjourned. At the next meeting a larger crowd attended and I put my case before the meeting: ‘I did not come here to drive something down their throats; I did not come here to say “You are not to support the Burra,” and I think you will bear me out.’

He then said the voting figures in the Record – 30 for and 1 against & 21 abstaining – were very misleading.

‘Those who did not vote were people who had lost their sons, and did not take part in the meeting.’

The Record reports my warning ‘Before you put this motion, which is a bit hard, think a bit. You can’t go to the Burra without giving, and if you tie yourselves hard and fast to Mount Bryan you are wholly and solely on your own.’

But we are not hard and fast against Burra: Mr Jefferies said ‘We’ll put Mt Bryan first and then if Burra put up a scheme and we like it we can help them afterwards.’

Mr Pearse accused me of having influenced the vote, ‘but no man will move one of the best districts of people who know how to think for themselves.’

[After some nicely flattering comments about the local area and its people Mr Warnes goes on to say only 8-10 did not vote, rather than the 21 in the Record.]

He then turns to Mr Pearse’s suggestion he retire from public positions in Burra now he ‘has renounced the Burra’.

Mr Collins interjected: ‘It is the positions he would like.’

Mr Warnes agreed that was what Mr Hawkes and Mr Pearse wanted – ‘a clear run’.

[He then goes on about the Hospital Board and some of its woes, before running through other positions they may challenge him for if they wish.]

He is President of the Burra Show soc.

President of the Stock Owners’ Assoc.

He says he is on 14 or 15 committees [amended later in a letter to the Record to 28 -30.] and of them six or seven are in town. He was only paid for one position: managing Mr Tawke’s sheep shearing company.

He then takes offence at Mr Pearse’s comments that Mr Warnes finds the Burra Dead unworthy of consideration and therefore the living must be beneath contempt. He stands by his patriotic efforts during the war. He has never waited to be asked to subscribe to the various funds or the War Loan. Mr Warnes then rehearses his credentials as a Burra boy and goes on to consider the supposed selfishness of Mt Bryan wanting its own memorial and says he thinks centralisation is one of the evils of the day.

If we are to be public spirited enough to support Burra then surely Burra should be public spirited enough to support Mt Bryan. I say I have £100 for Mt Bryan, £100 for Burra and £100 for Booborowie and now I expect Mr Pearse and Mr Hawkes to match that.

Burra has done great things in the war effort, helped by people from the districts, but so have other places. If you go to Clare you find the same societies doing the same work, but they don’t get on the chimney tops and advertise it. Burra today has used Violet Day to gather subscriptions from the districts for gold medals for the boys who went from Burra. The districts have already done that without going to Burra for help.

‘Mr Pearse says we are selfish, but I say the Burra is selfish, and has been right through the chapter.’

During the whole time Mr Crewes has been Mayor, the whole of the war, the District Council has never had an invitation to attend any public function in the Burra. It is the same at Booborowie. Before Mr Crewes came in there was always an invitation. ‘They have taught us to run alone and now they don’t like it.’

They have not called a meeting at Hanson or Apoinga because Mr Hawkes is Chairman and he does not want them to go on their own.

[Mr Warnes then goes on to defend his position on the Mt Bryan District Council and he also itemises how he has helped young men returning from the war to get established by selling them land at low cost.]

As for the Burra including the district in acknowledgements, he mentions the Ambulances, which, when handed over, were given the appearance of having all come from Burra, when the people of Burra gave one and two gentlemen gave one and the money was collected from the district.

He reads out a report of Peace Day at Leighton, from when the decision was made to have a separate Peace Day was made. He still believes what he said then.

Mr Rigby then spoke in support of Mr Warnes.

He considered Mr Pearse had taken the opportunity to settle old scores.

He said, ‘long before I came here I had heard of Mr Warnes, and his character, and it is useless for me to try to extol him in your minds. I appreciate much a liberal-minded man who tries to live up to the reputation of manhood and makes his word his bond, but I do not wish to enlarge upon that.’

He was opposed to giving any help to Burra until the Mt Bryan project was completed.

He agreed that centralisation was the curse of the times.

Mr Warnes ended by saying: ‘The first thing is that the Burra Record should give us a big donation, because the people will want hundreds of papers.’

Peace Day in Burra, last Saturday 19 July.

The Procession

Soon after 10.30 it departed Sara’s Corner. Trooper Harry Brown led as flag-bearer followed by the Ladies’ band, then the returned men four abreast with Major T. Kenyon in command and led by Lieuts. R.A. Cock, K.C. Sandland & V.A. Riggs. Then came the Oddfellows Lodges in regalia and miniature Red Cross Nurses. A lorry then carried the young ladies of the Soldiers’ Aid Soc. They included Miss T. Bentley representing Peace with palm branches, Miss C. Bartholomaeus as Britannia and Miss Clarice Reed as Justice. Other ladies and gentlemen represented the allies. Reggie Pearce’s miniature buggy and girls with decorated umbrellas were next. Then came the Foresters in regalia and the Boy Scouts. J. Allen as John Bull led the Burra Band. Scholars of Copperhouse School followed – the boys dressed as sailors and the girls as nurses or in white. James Reed’s decorated car led the Burra School Fife & Drum Band. Then came children from Hanson, Gum Creek, World’s End, Copperhouse, Leighton & Burra Schools carrying small flags. The march went from Sara’s Corner to the Hospital and then turned and went direct to Victoria Park where each child was given a large bun and at noon they were given a luncheon bag and hot tea.

At 1 p.m. the children marched past to deposit offerings for the memorial fund, during which time the Ladies’ band played and the children were given a Peace Medal. Sports followed at 2 p.m.

The Appeal was launched with speeches from Mr Hawkes and Mr Crewes, who said he believed £2,000 could be raised that day. Mr Chambers then auctioned on the bugler system the King’s Proclamation of Peace inscribed by Mr George Hann. There were pre-arranged promissory cards numbered in hundreds that took over the hour to read. The highest bid of £115 came from W.I. Short. Other substantial bids were: John Tennant & Family £110, T.H. Pearse & Sons £105, W.G. Hawkes & J.M. McBride each £100, Thomas Sandland £52-10-0 & J.H. Gallagher £50. The total bids numbered about 500 and raised £1,140.

The sports results are then printed in just under 1 column.

Football: Kooringa 4.9 (33) defeated Aberdeen 3.7 (25)

The Soldiers’ Aid Soc. & Red Cross Ladies provided luncheon and afternoon tea.

A huge bonfire that could be seen for miles was lit at 7 p.m. and fireworks were let off.

Takings for all the day are estimated at £1,400.

Thomas B. Ashton writes that following recent comments of the Hospital Board members that he could return to the hospital ‘if he likes to apply and comply with the rules’ he wrote congratulating Dr Steele on getting his salary increased from £75 to £120. He then goes over the grounds given for his dismissal in 1917 and specifically goes over the cancer case where he arranged for an operation and then failed to carry it out because, as he said, the patient had suddenly grown worse and the operation was inappropriate. The real reason for his dismissal he says was the disinclination of the Board to strengthen the staff when medical officers thought it essential.

The context then suggests that it was on the 25 July that they welcomed Cpl A. Tiver, Pte Bob Bartholomaeus and Pte Spackman, but Cpl A. Tiver’s & Pte Spackman’s presence is reported at the social on 22 July, so this group may have arrived on the 18 July.

Peace Day, Hallett, Saturday 19 July.

Over £150 was collected for the Memorial Hall. There was a procession from the Institute.

RSL, AGM.

About 50 members attended the first AGM on Saturday. K.C. Sandland Senior Vice-President took the chair. The state executive was represented by three members.

Dr Steele was elected President and Vice-Presidents were S.M. Lane & Messrs Swift and C. Jones.

Mr Fearby outlined plans for the election of a state executive and said the League had grown from 2,747 members in 1 January 1918 to c. 13,000 on 30 June 1919, or 92% of all returned soldiers.

The Burra Branch had 140 members and in the past year income had been £525-8-6 and expenses £393. There was £221 in hand, but, said Mr Broderick, a problem loomed. Much of the income in the first year came from donations and this would not continue. Subscriptions were only £40 and £100 had been spent in salaries. Business methods would need to be employed.

Mr Sandland said this attack was unwarranted and no money had been squandered.

Mr Lane said he didn’t think Mr Broderick’s remarks were intended as an attack, but merely raised the question whether it was possible to continue with subscriptions only.

Mr Carter said Mr Broderick obviously thought they could not afford a paid secretary

Mr Broderick said he was not criticising the secretary or the executive, but they must try to arrange finances so ordinary expenditure was met from ordinary revenue.

Miss Dorothy Hawkes was presented with a certificate of appreciation for work done for the branch.

The Secretary’s report reveals expenses for the year of £90 for salaries and £11-10-0 for expenses. Cash donations were £65 and furniture donations worth £168. £27 for repairs was paid by the building’s owners, representing the first year’s rent.

The mayor said several districts had decided to erect their own memorials and so could not, as districts, join in schemes for a central one, but now as the greater part of the sum had been raised Mr Crewes thought they should again be asked to join an executive to call for designs and prices. It was everyone’s desire to include the name of every boy who had fallen and who had enlisted from Burra or the district.

A meeting of delegates from the various DCs will be called. Burra Town will be represented by the Mayor and Mr Winnall, with Mr G.E. Dane as a non-voting delegate ex officio.

Burra & District Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial Fund.

The committee met on Thursday evening. Representatives came from the districts except for I.J. Warnes (Mt Bryan) & W.S. Murray (Booborowie) who were unable to consult their respective Councils in time.

The structure will be marble or granite or both, surmounted by a life-sized bronze statue of an Australian Infantryman.

Space will be allotted for the names of fallen soldiers from each of the following districts if so desired: Corporation of Burra, DCs of Burra, Hanson, Mt Bryan, Hallett, Apoinga, & Booborowie. The classification of names will be left to a sub-committee

Applications will be called for competitive designs for a cost not to exceed £2,000 with a prize of £10-10-0 for the approved design. Designs are to be in to the Hon. Sec, Mr Dane by 10 Nov. 1919.

The Burra Corporation’s approval will be sought for a suitable site.

The Editor of The Record will be approached to stimulate contributions by a weekly appeal in the paper’s columns.

The Scouts took charge of the cool drinks at the Burra Show for the Sporting & athletic Club and for the RSL and collected 6,585 pennies for Australia Day and took part in all patriotic processions. They were inspected by Brigadier-General Forsythe on Violet Day 1918, Colonel Price Weir on Australia Day 1919 and formed guards of honour for Lieut.-Col Butler & Lieut. Colly on their visits to the town and also for Col. McKay at the last Annual Show. Their annual concerts had been successful. They had made presentations in appreciation of their help to Mr I.J. Warnes & Mr E.C. Sedgman. The annual Christmas camps have been a highlight of the year. The troop has been well represented at the last two rallies in Adelaide. A banquet on the 14 August celebrated their 4th anniversary.

‘Hanson’ writes that on 18 September he was surprised to see a man ‘or overgrown boy’ pass through a fence enclosing a road on both sides of which there was a standing crop of wheat. There was a mob of sheep nearby, but the person did not put up the fence or do anything to protect the crop. He knows there should have been a gate there, but had thought neither man nor boy would be so mean as to destroy a man’s crop, especially when the man was a returned soldier.

Burra & District Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial.

Ten applications for particulars have been received in response to the advertisement for a design. The Mayor reported the Council had inspected the site, but the absence of the Overseer (with influenza) meant the exact site could not be determined. The east boundary to be in line with the present fence. The south boundary to be taken back 12-14’. The other fence to form a sort of ‘bull-nose’ in a line with the corner of Lord’s Hotel building. The town Clerk is to draw a plan.

A proposal to have the memorial at the northern end of the enclosure would mean moving the Rotunda to bring it into line. Also it is proposed to flank the memorial with captured German guns, which had been promised. There was also a proposal to enlarge the Rotunda with a verandah.

Obituary of H. Tralaggan.

Mr Henry Tralaggan died 23 September at his home in Redruth. He had been born at the Reedbeds SA 13 August 1841.

He was also a member of the School Board of Advice and an ardent Methodist. He was the founder of the Razorback Chapel, which was dismantled in 1884, after which he attended the Mt Bryan Church, holding every office over the years. He retired to Redruth about ten years ago and became a teacher at the Redruth Methodist Sunday School. He married Miss Mary Montgomery, daughter of Mr & Mrs Sampson Montgomery, in August 1863. There are two sons and three daughters: Fred (Mt Bryan East), Isaac (Mt Bryan), Mrs James Bass (Hallett), Mrs Joseph Causby (Gawler) & Mrs Elliott Bell (Hallett). There are 17 grandchildren.

Thomas McNamara writes in reply to ‘Hanson’ of 24 September 1919 page 3, concerning the bad behaviour of a returned soldier at Hanson and explaining why behaviour that disadvantaged him was not entirely undeserved. [He says that the returned soldier in question last harvest when carting materials for his fence passed his own crop and deliberately drove through a crop of wheat just coming out in head, for nearly a quarter of a mile that the writer had in shares with T. James (also a returned soldier). This thoroughly destroyed a strip of crop and he has also for the last three months been passing through a road the writer was renting from the DC and leaving it open. With such behaviour he cannot expect better from others.

Harold Escott, who was acquitted in May 1915 of murdering his father at Black Springs, has been charged at Tenterfield NSW with cattle theft. He gave evidence that he enlisted in 1915 and saw service at Gallipoli and in France. He was badly wounded in arms, legs and stomach, underwent seven operations and was shell-shocked, being discharged in April 1918. He became an auctioneer at Tenterfield. He had bought 30 cattle at £6 each, but owing to financial problems couldn’t pay for them. Unable to decide what to do he told Heffernan to take some of Mr Munsie’s cattle and he would fix it up with the latter, but he failed to raise the money when arrested. Dr R.B. North attested to Escott’s shell-shock and that he had a useless arm, which he thought, should be amputated. A 12-month sentence was suspended under the First Offender’s Act, provided restitution of £330-12-6 was made.

The Board is in debt to the bank for £113.

‘Hanson’ writes again in reply to Thomas McNamara of the previous week.

He thinks the culprit of the original damage to quarter-mile of crop should be willing to pay for it. He estimates 9 or 10 chains at about a bushel of wheat at a prevailing price of c. 4/-. As for McNamara’s complaint that a returned soldier has been passing through his rented road and leaving it open: if McNamara had placed there a 12ft swung gate as required by the DC instead of two barbed wires to get through then he considers that the offender and his wife would be less inclined to leave the way open.

The Burra Show, Wednesday 22 October.

Ideal weather drew a large crowd. A special train ran from Terowie. The grounds were in perfect condition. Sideshows were numerous. Takings for lunch and afternoon tea by the Soldiers’ Aid Soc. were £118 and the profit will go to Red Cross. Gate takings were £97 – low because by an act of omission no charge was made for vehicles. £37 was taken at the picture show and a dance followed where Mr Broderick was the MC and over £8 was taken.

Agricultural produce was excellent, dairy produce was down in quantity, but of good quality. Poultry had as usual a large showing. Horse entries were very good. Dogs were rather poor and cattle and sheep numbers were low, but of first class quality. Agricultural implement display was one of the largest ever seen in SA. Vegetables and flowers were both of a high standard. Cookery was well patronised. Arts & Industries required much more room than was available and competition in the school class was keen.

The addresses were to have been from a platform at the decorated rotunda, but the extreme heat drove them to a trolly drawn up in the shade of the shop verandahs. The Cheer-up Ladies’ band provided music. Some had asked why a further patriotic effort now, after the war was over. Captain Clare said the Navy had made the transport of the men in khaki easy and at the cost of hundreds of lives kept the seas clear. The merchant service had lost 2,500 ships and 15,000 sailors.

Burra Show Society.

A special meeting was called by President I.J. Warnes. After ten shows Mr Treloar tendered his resignation as secretary and it was reluctantly accepted. He was voted a £10 bonus.

Financially things were not good. Despite a donation of £100 from the President, which had practically paid off the overdraft, it looked like the show would sustain a loss of c. £9 The gate takings were unsatisfactory and the alterations to the toilets that were required should have been half paid for by the Racing Club, but it said it had no funds.

The President was disgusted at the gate takings (where the failure to charge vehicles lost considerable income) and at the failure of farmers to become members or to take only the cheapest form of membership.

He would like the general and sheep shows to be combined. Having them separate reduced crowds at the sheep show and added costs for preparation. Printing costs seemed excessive.

He was also concerned that some committees were not working well and work devolved upon too few of the members.

Mr Somerville, a leading horse exhibitor suggested a combined show at the end of September.

Mr Warnes was thanked for his work and granted leave of absence for his overseas trip.

Mr & Mrs I.J. Warnes, who were about to go on a world trip, were accorded a farewell social last Wednesday at Leighton Hall. It took the form of a banquet and in just over 2 columns there are reports of speeches by Messrs Winnall, McLaren, W. Cock, J.Q. Hogan, J. Gallagher, J. Drew, L. Foote, S.M. Lane, Ruthven, E.W. Crewes, Wade & Cr Radford.

Mr Warnes’s reply gives something of his life story and more of his philosophy.

He said he had wanted to go in 1914, but the war had prevented him. Now he either had to give up work, or take a long break. He had lost energy and drive. Up to then whatever he undertook ‘he always made it his business to be boss.’ The first money he earned was 37/6 from his father for shooting kangaroos. His father paid him no wages till he was 21 and then £1 plus clothes and food and an occasional holiday. He recalled going to into Burra and returning without spending virtually anything because there was nothing he saw that he wanted. Even now he would pay anything for what he wanted, but would not buy any article, however cheap, if he did not have a use for it. As a youth he had an ambition to have £1,000 and be married by 30. He was left something and married at 28. He said he would be happy when he shore 20,000 sheep or got 4,000 bales of wool. Today he shore 40,000 sheep. He had succeeded in improving wool yield. He was fighting the battle of his life [to be re-energised and given purpose]. When he went to Adelaide first he was green, but he believed he had done some good as a representative of the pastoralists. He had seen the Board of the Pastoralists’ Association change to young energetic men and their financial position improve vastly to a credit they called ‘Warnes’ money’. There were times when he needed money – last year he had an overdraft of £20,000, but he had the confidence and trust of those with whom he dealt. With the exception of a few minor accounts he now owed no one anything. He was also quick to cut his losses if a venture failed. He made friends and foes, but bore no malice. He gave hard knocks, but believed a man was better regarded is he said straight out what was on his mind. He had once ridden a bicycle 100 miles to play cricket against Burra, made a duck and enjoyed it. He had enjoyed his life work since. There was still much to be done. He hoped to see the battlefields of France and hoped to be home for next shearing in 8 or 9 months.

XXXXI, 48, 3 Dec. 1919, Supplement

Mayor’s Report 1919.

The year thankfully saw the signing of the Peace on 19 July, which was duly celebrated in Burra and District.

Agriculture this year is looking quite good with a reasonable yield and good prices. Pastoralists continue to do well.

The seaside trip was abandoned at the last minute on account of the influenza outbreak.

Anzac day was commemorated on 25 April.

The League of Loyal Women closed their tea rooms in February, having realised over £100 for Trench Comforts. The League continues other activities.

Burra Cheer-up Ladies’ band has been active at all patriotic efforts and greeted hundreds of soldiers as they returned home.

Violet Day on 4 July was held in excellent weather to honour the fallen with a service at 3 p.m.

About £300 was raised.

Burra Red Cross Soc. from June 1915 to June 1919 has raised £2,043-5-4 and still meets to give aid to various hospitals.

Red Triangle Day in May raised c. £56 for the YMCA.

Boy Scouts have continued to be active in patriotic work. On 1 February the Boys’ Hall was opened by the Mayor and the Bazaar was opened by Mrs I.J. Warnes – proceeds were £46.

Navy Day was held for the third time in Burra on 5 November and about £350 was raised.

Burra Sporting & Athletic Club has continued to present a wallet with £5 to every local returned boy.

Burra Show on 22 October saw another record attendance and many felt it was the best ever.

Burra Cheer-up Society has been particularly active in welcoming returning soldiers both at the station and with socials and last month organised a banquet for them all at the Institute when a gold medal was presented to each as a small token for services rendered.

Last Monday it was decided to present £20 cash to each of 12 returned men who had lost a limb or been grievously wounded.

The Soldiers’ Aid Soc. has taken a very active part in all patriotic efforts and directs its attention especially to the needs of sick and wounded men.

Peace day on 19 July was celebrated in Burra with a grand procession and demonstration at Victoria Park where sports were held for the children and an appeal was made for funds for the Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial. The children filed past to make their donations and to receive a Peace Medal. The total amount raised that day was c. £1,800.

A Peace Thanksgiving Service that was held on 6 July at the Institute was packed, many people standing.

The general account began the year in credit £17-17-7 and ends in debit £55-0-6. Though some accounts are yet to be paid to affect the ward balances, all their accounts are in credit.

Parklands account has spent money on trees etc. and went from £7-19-10 in credit to £39-18-7 in credit for the year.

The cemetery has had necessary repairs done and is in good order. Its account began in credit £122-16-8 and ends in credit £144-7-10.

The Main Road Grant of £340, which is insufficient to adequately maintain them to a good standard, is presently in credit £82, but this will vanish by the end of the year.

Tar-paving has been improved during the year and the expenses are justified by the results.

Local Board of Health.

The outbreak of influenza early in the year saw added expense and the setting up of the Boy Scout’s Hall as a hospital. The disease was soon stamped out, though several deaths resulted from it. This resulted in a debit balance of £128-4-2 after starting the year £7-2-4 in credit. An increase in the health rate may be necessary.

The lighting account began in debit £31-12-6 and ends in debit £33-6-4. More money is needed to maintain even the present poor level of lighting. Arrangements to get electric light from various private providers are proving very satisfactory.

All in all the year has been one of progress with the erection of new houses and other buildings and the renovation of others. The replacement of Dead Man’s Bridge is in hand. The provision of £240 from the Commonwealth has enabled this work (on condition it be done by returned soldiers).

Redruth Methodist Church Welcome Home Social 27 November for Trooper Vernon Nicholls & Trooper Cliff Turner & Cpl N. James & his wife.

Soldiers’ Aid Soc. 70 members went out for a picnic at the Gorge on 11 November. Mr I.J. Warnes lent his lorry and trailer for the occasion. The morning was cool and threatening, but the afternoon proved ideal. At 11 a.m. along the road the National Anthem was sung and two minutes silence observed.

The Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting was held last Monday at the Institute. Mr F. Treloar took the chair and about 35 attended. The Mayor regretted the small turnout. The mayor said that he had promised to do his best to carry out his duties and any failure was not for want of trying. He had been asked to stand again to see the erection of the Soldiers’ Memorial, but had declined to do so. He read his report.

Cr Radford said it was to the Town Clerk’s credit that of £1,000 due in rates only about £8 was outstanding. Generally the financial position was healthy. The health account deficit was the main problem. He referred to hoodlum activity, which all should try to stop. The new public telephone in Aberdeen was an example. People jammed it with buttons etc.

Cr Dane said he had done his best without being anything extraordinary. Much of the surplus in West Ward was due to lack of tar and labour for approved works. The old time feud between North and other Wards seems to have died out and he hoped it would not be revived.

Red Cross met on 21 November and decided that since the need for its work is now over it will go into recess. The members will continue to pay their contributions of 2/6 a year and be ready for action if needed. Funds in hand are thought to be adequate for all needs and the society will continue its handicraft classes and the rest & recreation rooms. Material on hand will be made up and by the year’s end there should be enough clothing on hand for needs. The last meeting is planned for 19 December, unless the society is called on again.

The Bass Relief Fund stands at £19-1-0.

Bombardier Melrose & Sgt H. Bald were given a welcome home to Hallett on Monday 17 November.

Visiting Day at Burra School is reported in 11⁄2 columns.

At the end of 1919 there were 151 boys and 132 girls on the roll with an average attendance of 227 for the year. The Children’s Patriotic Fund was closed last June and final returns showed Burra School contributed £491-16-4 and purchased £115 of War Certificates.

Mr Hitchcox, head teacher, gives a report.

Mr Biddle, head of the High school also reported.

1919 was a poor year for numbers there with only 17 as against 42 at the start on 1918 and at present there were only 11. Of the 42 in January 1918, 26 were starting their first year and of these 7 removed from the district, 12 left at the end of the year and 7 are at school. Of those who left most had just reached 14. They have missed a golden opportunity to obtain a sound education. As a consequence Miss Jones was transferred to Gladstone High where they can maintain an attendance of c. 40. Influenza had also affected attendance this year.

Last year the exams saw several successes: Alma Wicklein, Grace Lloyd & Gordon Forrest gained their Junior Commercial Certificate. Johanna Francis passed in five subjects, but failed in one compulsory one and subsequently passed the short course teachers’ exam. Ian Finch & Cliff Bartholomaeus passed the Junior Public Certificate.

The High School is in a very precarious position and it is not likely to continue unless numbers rise.

Burra Brass Band Concert at the rotunda in aid of the Bass Relief Fund raised £11-0-6 by collection.

E.J. Davey writes expressing concern that a new Act, The Hospitals Contribution Act, which empowers the Inspector General of Hospitals to order Councils to raise such a rate as he deems necessary to maintain a hospital – without provision for consultation with either Council or ratepayer.

Thomas Ashton writes re the hospital situation, where he claims discriminatory treatment in that the other doctor continues to treat private patients at the hospital and charge for it while it was for that that he was banned from it.

RSL Social. The RSL put on a social at the Institute for members of local patriotic societies on Thursday evening in appreciation of the work done to support enlisted men. It was a lovely cool evening, the hall had been lavishly decorated and the seating was equal to the large attendance. Dr Steele announced there would be no speeches [other than his of course] – not even one from Mr Crewes. Mr Crewes has laryngitis and he professionally forbade him to speak. A series of vocal and instrumental items was provided. Tea and coffee and supper followed. Mr Crewes did manage in the end to move the vote of thanks. Dancing to midnight followed.

Ironmine Strawberry Fete last Saturday was a great success. It was to provide funds towards a Memorial Room at Ironmine and it raised over £82, which with other contributions brings the fund to about £152.

Cricket. At Aberdeen on Saturday: Kooringa 1 for 145 defeated Mt Bryan 69.

St Mary’s Conversazione on Friday was an alternative to a bazaar, which falls heavily on the ladies. There was a good spread and an array of useful articles. Strawberries and cream were served. It was to aid church funds.

Tennis. On Saturday 6 December: Aberdeen 13-95 defeated Copperhouse 5-75.

Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting (Continued from last issue.)

Cr McBride said he had not had an entirely pleasant time. He considered a new and higher assessment was needed, but had been overruled and much of the increase of £500 seems to have been on his properties:

Pearce’s Store rose from £46 to £56

Hunt’s rose from £26 to £30

Broderick’s rose from £30 to £35,

While R.D. Pascoe with about the same frontage was unchanged.

Drew & Crewes, despite improvements, only rose from £195 to £200, while Elder’s and Ewins were unaltered. Mr Winnall’s garage rose from £25 to £35. His outside blocks went from £10 to £20 and the slaughterhouse property from £17 to £25.

The mayor elect and Councillors then occupied the platform.

Mr Lane regretted the lack of interest in the Council elections. At 11 a.m. on nomination day there had been no candidates for West Ward. He would do all he could to help the town as Mayor.

Cr Radford thanked the ratepayers for his re-election.

He commented on Cr McBride’s wish for a higher assessment and pointed out that when his assessments rose he had twice appealed against them – this year being the only person to do so. No one who knew the Town Clerk would accuse him of dealing unfairly. He thought electric light the only way out of the lighting problem.

Mr Kellaway thought the workers deserved a shilling a day more.

Mr Ewins said he was ignorant of municipal affairs, but would do his best in his new position.

There was then considerable interchange between Mr Winnall and the Councillors elect and Councillors on the increase in his rates.

All were in favour of tar-paving and keeping up and extending gardens.

Mr Davey defended the assessment and said other assessments had been raised. Farmers’ Union had gone from £50 to £200. He could have raised Mr McBride’s vacant land by 5%, but had only increased it 31⁄2%. There was no appeal except by Mr McBride who perplexingly now said his were not high enough.

All were in favour of tenders for leasing park lands.

There was a six column-wide supplement, single-sided, with a 51⁄2 column report on Senator Newland & Hon R. W. Foster in Burra for the Federal Election campaign on Tuesday last week at the Institute.

The Town Clerk asked for £20 a year more, but it was decided to combine the jobs of Town Clerk & Inspector and offer it to Mr E.J. Davey at £180. His old salary was £100. Mr Wilks, the present inspector was reluctantly given one month’s notice.

Local Board of Health.

Dr Steele has recommended getting Typhoid Serum and making it available to the public. The doctor is to be allowed to charge his patients a fee for administering the serum and the public is to be advised via advertisement. On bottle of 10cc is to be obtained as a trial.

A.J. McBride writes concerning Dr Ashton’s recent letter about the hospital. He wonders if there is great dissatisfaction. From the number of patients treated over recent months it would seem the management is satisfactory. The average number of patients for some time is quite 30 and before the war it was only 20. It is not true that patients can only be admitted by the Board – they can be admitted by any Qualified Medical Practitioner and have been for years. It is intended to give Dr Ashton the same rights as Dr Steele in admitting patients, so as to give his patients the benefit of hospital treatment. Mc Bride says he told Dr Steele he had no doubt an application from Dr Ashton to become a medical officer on equal terms with Dr Steele would be accepted, but Dr Ashton for reasons best known to himself would not give consent to Dr Steele’s contemplated action in asking for two medical officers. Dr Steele has apparently not made any official request pending Dr Ashton’s consent.

Annual Meeting of Ratepayers (Continued)

Medical Officer’s Report

The Corporation is to be congratulated with passing through a year characterised by a severe influenza epidemic with such a low mortality. It was most severe in May when a number of cases of pneumonic type were reported. Many towns were finding isolation hospitals required and it looked like Burra would need one. The Scout Hall was converted for use. Luckily the increase in cases did not occur and the epidemic abated. The hospital was closed after a fortnight had elapsed since the last case was discharged. Later the epidemic returned, but this time, although almost every household was affected the form was milder and there were few pneumonic cases. The Burra Hospital was adequate by using the private wards and one general ward as the influenza hospital and the spread to general wards was controlled with great care. There have been a few cases of diphtheria and measles, but not in epidemic form.

Mrs Ambrose Harris turns 86 on Christmas Day. She was born at Camborne, Cornwall in 1833 and married in April 1851. A month later they left for SA on the Sultana. They lived in Bowden and Adelaide until coming to Burra in 1856. Mr Harris was a stone-dresser and builder and he died in 1901, three weeks after his golden wedding. Five of twelve children survive: Mrs J.A. Watt (Adelaide), Mrs R.H. Steele (Rose Park), Mrs Charles Parks & Mrs J.E. Greenwood (Kooringa) and Mr J.B. Harris (Kalgoorlie).

Outside employees gained an extra 1/- a day.

The offices of the Town Clerk and Inspector will be combined at £180 p.a.

The Inspector, Mr Wilks was called in and given one month’s notice – a step only taken because of financial necessity.

Glenister & Sama advise the cost of installing two electric lights in Aberdeen would be £29. Consideration was postponed.

Cricket. On Saturday: Kooringa 91 defeated Aberdeen Quarry 79.

Burra State School Annual Concert was held in the Institute on Thursday evening and is reported in 3⁄4 column. The gross takings of £20 would be matched by the Education Department and £40 would pay off the piano and allow other purchases of educational benefit. Mr Hitchcox, who is moving to Peterborough, was presented with a Gladstone bag.

Copperhouse School broke up on 19 December. Elsie Kellaway got a silver medal for not missing a day in the year. Allan Lomman & Isabel Kellaway passed the Qualifying Certificate this year. Allan Lomman is only 11. Miss McCarthy, who has been in charge for three years, now goes to Happy Valley and Miss Jane Crongey comes in her place from Prospect Hill.

Driver Clyde Penglase has been welcomed back at Hallett.

Dr Ashton writes in reply to Mr McBride. He wonders by what magic a doctor has been able to treat and charge private patients at the hospital after the Board of Enquiry had found it illegal. He says he has not fallen in with Dr Steele’s proposal because he abhors anything savouring of cabal or intrigue. He assures the chairman that dissatisfaction certainly exists. He finds it strange they are now happy to have 30 patients when previously they complained it was full at 20. [And he also goes over old ground again.

W.G. Hawkes writes urging some tangible public recognition of the services of Mr Crewes through the long war years.

E.W. Crewes writes acknowledging £3-3-0 from J.M. McBride towards Christmas cheer for the poor.

‘Ratepayer’ writes expressing dismay at the manner in which the Council dealt with an old servant, in dismissing Mr Wilks. What knowledge does Mr Davey have in the important job of inspecting the milk supply and slaughtered cattle? The decision seems hurried and ill-considered.

Characteristics of the paper in 1919.

Page 1

Large advertisements in the main and mostly of local origin.

Page 2

A mixture of different sized advertisements, but nearly all are local and particularly concerned with sales, local government and public announcements. The amount of news fluctuates from none to almost half the page.

Page 3

News and a couple of larger advertisements.

Page 4

Some news in fluctuating amounts, but advertisements generally dominate, though some of them look very much like news items at first glance.

The paper in general gives a very good cover of district events throughout the year and in particular traces the lives and deaths of district servicemen and women. Local patriotic efforts are covered in considerable detail.
