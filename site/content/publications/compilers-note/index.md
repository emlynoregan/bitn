Burra in the News by Eric Fuss

Total number of pages 9,175 = 18 reams of paper = 900mm in 2020

Compiler’s Notes November 2015

This CD contains a summary of Burra in the Newspapers.  It does not cover everything, but gives an outline of the main events in the town and of the principal characters as far as they are reported in the papers of the day.

The oldest references come from the SA Register.  This Adelaide newspaper carried fairly regular reports from Burra before the local paper started in 1877

SA Register (613 pages)

Ian Auhl’s research collected together the references to Burra in this paper for the years 1845 to 1876 when the local paper began on 30 June.

The Burra Record  (6,862 pages) & its predecessors)

Noted from 1876 to its closure as a separate entity 8 March 1977, with the following exceptions:

Seven years of the Burra Record were not available in hard copy and the following years are missing from the above, yet to be completed from microfilm, i.e. 1959

AFTER THE ‘BURRA RECORD’

The period after March 1977 is messy with a number of sources needed and the period before the Burra Broadcaster began in the 1990s is particularly difficult.  Work here is fragmentary and slow.  This all has to be done from hard copy, some of which is confined to the library or to the Clare History Group’s room.  The following fragments have been noted.

Review Times Record (87 pages)

Noted from 17 March 1977 to 13 July 1978 with a few gaps due to missing copies.

Noted from 8 August 1985 to 12 February 1987, again with a few gaps.

After this date this paper is not worth noting for Burra news, although I have noted a small number of articles until the end of 1987.

The missing papers between March 1977 and February 1987 will have to be sourced in the Adelaide library.

The Northern Argus  (73 pages)

This needs to be noted from the end of the ‘Burra Record’ in March 1977 until the start of the Burra Broadcaster in the 1990s.  So far very little of this has been done.

Only August 1985 to December 1987 has been noted.

The Burra Broadcaster (762 pages)

2000 has been noted except for a handful of issues.

About half of 1999 has been noted with the missing issues scattered through the year.

A start has been made on noting 2002, but many issues are missing in this year too.

The gaps can be filled by work at the library in due course.

Mid North Broadcaster (371 pages)

Noted from 2008 to the end of its publication 26 June 2013 with only a few missing issues to be found.

A small number of the 2006 issues have been noted and a substantial part of the 2007 issues have been noted.

Burra School & Community News (407 pages)

When the ‘Burra Record’ ceased and left the town without a local newspaper the Burra School newsletter was expanded and distributed through the district as a free newspaper, dependent on donations.  This operated from 1978 to 1993 and provided much vital information of activities in the town.  Naturally school news was more detailed than other newspapers would have included.  Organisations and sport tended to be reasonably covered, but treatment of news events was rather haphazard.  (For example the burning down of the Sports Complex was barely noticed.)  The result is a useful, but inadequate record and in time the Northern Argus will have to be added to fill the gap.

CAUTION

Please note that this is a work in progress.  It was undertaken primarily as a reference for my own use.  It has not been proof read and the reader will find many typographical errors.  Material included in square brackets is explanatory, additional or offers corrections or warnings about possible errors.

I have usually indicated the need for caution about superlatives in the paper, but if any have slipped through without comment the reader should always beware of the accuracy when the reporter asserts things such as:

He was the first…

She was the oldest…

This was the biggest…

This was the wettest year on record (or since)…

You should also be aware that it was the habit of the local paper to describe a person as the ‘oldest miner (or grocer, or church member etc.) in the town’ when what they meant was ‘this was the miner who had lived longest in the town’.

Most obituaries are followed by material in square brackets.  Here I have attempted to supply the birth and death dates and places from SA Registration of Births and Deaths.  Sometimes this must be somewhat speculative because people’s names at birth, marriage and death are often different.  Often the ages given at marriage or death do not accord with the birth registrations.  Married women present the greatest difficulty in this regard.  The information provided must be regarded as a suggestion that might assist the family researcher and not as guaranteed fact.

NOTE

Anything that appears in red indicates incorrect, unreliable or missing material.  Sometimes it means that my hand-written notes have been illegible, sometimes sections of the hard copy were missing or unreadable and sometimes it indicates an apparent error that needs correction or clarification.
