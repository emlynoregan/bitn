Burra Swimming Pool

The Committee met on 26 March and inspected sites including the old mill and the Drill Hall, the flats near the High School and the [Kooringa] Children’s Playground.  Taking into account the water supply, drainage, nearness to the school and accessibility, it was decided to choose the playground site.  They hope to see the playground equipment suitably relocated.  On 9 April the committee waited on the Town Council with all the information concerning the obtaining of a Government subsidy and expressed the hope that the Council would sanction the Committee’s request for the site and its application for a subsidy.  Once the Council’s sanction has been obtained there will be an all-out drive for finance.
