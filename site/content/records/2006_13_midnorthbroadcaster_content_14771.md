Lorna Sutton again organised Burra’s ‘Australia’s Biggest Morning Tea’ to support the Cancer Council SA.  About 50 turned out despite wintry conditions in Lorna Sutton & Leo Robinson’s back shed.  $550 was taken on the day and extra funds were raised through the annual bingo and raffle, which when added on made the total raised $1,714.
