Skate Park.  Ashley Williams (Year 11 BCS) has produced a short film with cinematographer Bud Norris, titled Skateboarding, as part of the ‘Eat My Shorts’ film festival, in which youth from five schools across the Mid North were involved in creating films screened on 8 November.  Skateboarding was judged Film of the Festival. Ashley (17) is a motocross enthusiast, but sees skateboarding as an issue that needs to be addressed and he hopes the Goyder Council will take note of the message.  With no skate park, Burra youth are taking their skateboards and their tricks to the street, which is dangerous.  Lower North Youth Health worker, Danielle Bradford supports the idea of a skate park and Heidi Thompson from the Goyder Council is also interested in the idea.
