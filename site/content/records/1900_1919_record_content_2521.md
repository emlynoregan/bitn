Obituary.  Mrs Drake, widow of the late H.J. Drake, was singeing a goose about 11 a.m. when her dress caught fire.  Her daughter managed to extinguish the flames by wrapping her in the covering from the sofa, but the burns resulted in her death about 3.20 p.m.  She apparently ran about the room when the accident occurred because the curtains on the safe and cupboards, carpet, tablecloth, a mangle and a loaf of bread were also burnt or damaged.  It is amazing the house was saved.  Mrs Drake was a resident for 44 years, arriving in SA in 1850 and in 1857 marrying Mr Drake at St Luke’s Adelaide.  They then came to Burra where Mr Drake died in 1871 at the age of 39.  Mrs Drake then kept a boarding house.  She leaves two sons; Francis Henry (married) Mayor of Port Wakefield and Robert.  There is also a daughter, Emily.  [Born Maria Marshall: died 25 December 1900 aged 64]
