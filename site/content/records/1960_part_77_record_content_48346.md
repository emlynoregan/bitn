Burra Burra DC, 3 November

Burra Cemetery.  A letter was presented from the Bishop of Port Pirie re transfer of the [Catholic] cemetery lot.  It was resolved that application be made to the Diocese of Pt Pirie to transfer the cemetery lot to this Council with the Council to bear the cost of the transfer.

It was resolved that Council supports the proposals of Samin Ltd to rework the Burra Mine area, but is anxious to see as many of the mining relics as possible preserved.

It was resolved to endorse the Clerkâ€™s decision to give Samin authority to enter the Mine area.

A letter is to be sent to the editors of the Advertiser and the News supporting mining operations.

Resolved that a meeting be arranged with three members of the National Trust to inspect the Mine area and arrange for the removal of historical items.

The fence [along the eastern side of Market Street] between Burra and Burra North is to be removed and cleaned and later a fence will be erected if required.
