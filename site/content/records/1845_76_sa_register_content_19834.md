Apoinga News, 9 October

Crops are generally looking well and in general a bountiful harvest is anticipated.

It was a great oversight that the Government sold the section near Springfield with a good ford.  Now teams have to go the back road, which is in a dangerous state.  It will cost the Government Â£200 or more.  Traffic is large and still increasing.
