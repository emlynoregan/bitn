Kooringa Methodist Church.  Opening of the New Kindergarten Rooms.

For some time now the officers and teachers have been contemplating an up-to-date movement to provide greater accommodation for an increased number of scholars and to introduce new methods of instruction.  Some time ago Me Lipson Hancock, Vice-President of the World’s Sunday School Union, visited and assisted in the drawing up of plans.  The aid of a generous donor enabled work to be entered upon at once.  Three months ago Messrs J. Pearce & Sons began the work.  The new additions are of small corrugated iron and matchboard with Wunderlich ceilings.  Sawdust has been used extensively as insulation in the walls.  The building is at the rear and is attached to the present lecture hall.  It contains Kindergarten and Primary schoolrooms, cloak rooms for lady teachers and a room for beginners.  Space is provided for secretaries’ tables and work.  There are two pianos, two baby organs and 100 kindergarten chairs, hygienic blackboards and adult chairs and space for parents and friends.  There is an excellent supply of sand trays.

Rev. A.W. Wellington, President of the SA Conference, opened the new rooms on Sunday 1 January after a short service.  Mr John Deene spoke words of explanation and appreciation.  Mr John Drew as Superintendent of the Sunday school explained the vision teachers had for the new school.  An appeal to the congregation for funds brought in £10, the Girls’ Church Aid raised £20 towards renovating the lecture hall and £30 towards the new building.
