The Kooringa Methodist Church celebrated the 21st anniversary of the present building and the 88th anniversary of Methodism in Burra last Saturday and Sunday.  The weather for the occasion was excellent and many old members of the congregation returned for the occasion.  Rev. John H. Nield was the minister when the present building was erected, but he could not attend as his wife died on 8 October.  They had been married in Burra in 1912.  She had taken a leading part when the foundation stones of the new building had been laid.  Rev. Alfred Finch had followed Rev. Nield and he accepted the invitation to conduct the anniversary services.

On Saturday afternoon the reunion of old friends went very well and there was community singing.

[A list of old choir members present is printed.  Among many present were Mr & Mrs John McLaren and Mrs August Fuss.]

At 5 p.m. all adjourned to the Lecture Hall for a magnificent ‘high tea’.  A presentation was made to Miss Jean Herbert who had only recently left the town.  [This is reported in 1¾ columns and the Saturday activities get 1 column, while the Sunday services are covered in c. ½ column.]
