PEB results in 1963 were outstanding with an 88% Leaving subject pass rate and 84% for Intermediate subjects.  In Leaving 14 of the 15 candidates gained certificates and in Intermediate 15 of the 22.  Dianne Wood is congratulated for obtaining a Continuation Exhibition and the A.B. Riggs Award.

The beneficiaries of the estate of the late Dr David MacDonald Steele have made available the income from the sum of £250 to be awarded to the Dux of the School or for any other purpose designated by the High School Council on the recommendation of the Headmaster.  For this year £12 is made available with £6 for the Dux and £6 for the library (the latter being subsidised pound for pound).
