Annie Pearce, daughter of C.J. Pearce was crossing the yard on Sunday carrying a turkey when the ground gave way and she dropped five feet into an old well.  Apparently it had long been filled in, but the filling had shrunk leaving only a thin crust.  Miss Pearce was shaken, but unhurt and when found still held the turkey.  Mr Pearce (aged 75) had wheeled several barrow-loads of wood over the spot only the day before.
