The Lady Denison

At last we have some real evidence of the fate of this missing barque.  At Emu Bay a sealer has told Captain Duncan of the Lapwing that about a month earlier he had seen, bottom up and on shore a longboat marked Lady Denison.  This was on the ‘Church Rock’ on the west coast of Van Diemen’s Land.  Clothing and other items of the ship were scattered along the shore.  There is therefore no reason to doubt that the ship met her fate in one of the gales which were noticed after her departure from here.  It is barely possible that some crew or passengers may have survived, but we fear there is very little ground for hope.

[This was the vessel that was carrying Gottlieb Keirnall, the German convicted of the manslaughter of John Smith, to serve his sentence in Tasmania.  It is possible that the ship did not sink and this is discussed in Pike, Douglas 1967, Paradise of Dissent, 2nd Edition, Melbourne University Press, Melbourne, page 295.

‘Two years later rumours reached Adelaide that the ship had not foundered at all; she had been sighted near Hobart and seen to alter course suddenly and steer away from land.  A German from Melbourne had been heard to state that he had received a letter from a fellow countryman among the prisoners.  In Adelaide it was recalled that certain low friends of the prisoners had boasted soon after the ship had sailed that an attempt would be made to capture her.  Finally a man named Byett, arrested on the Ovens goldfield on suspicion of murder, was recognised by an ex-Adelaide policeman as one of the Lady Denison prisoners.  As it reached Adelaide, Byett’s story was that the prisoners on the vessel had risen upon the constables and thrown them and the captain overboard; the passengers’ lives were spared and they had been landed upon some island; the Lady Denison had sailed to California where the prisoners quickly lost themselves amongst the diggers.  Lack of co-operation between the neighbouring police forces prevented a final solution of the mystery.
