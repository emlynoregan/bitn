The Goyder Community Planning Group has secured a grant of $1,000 from Community Arts SA to run workshops to develop celebration ideas for 2001, the centenary of Federation and a further $40,000 from SA Centenary of Federation to fund community celebration, federation arches and silhouettes.

Burra Community Development on 8 June decided to advertise for consultants to develop a Strategic Plan for the Burra Town Hall and Regional Art gallery precinct.  Assistance has come in the form of a $6,000 grant from Working Towns SA.  Anderson Muller were the chosen consultants and following acceptance of the plans by the Burra Community Development, the Goyder Council has agreed to commit $20,000 for work to be done on the Town Hall and precinct upgrade.  Burra Community Development now looks forward to Anderson Mullerâ€™s recommendations.
