Burra District Council Elections.

The Nominations

Kooringa Ward	Edward Catchlove Lockyer

Gottlieb Gustav Clemm

William T. Rabbich

Baldina Ward	Thomas McWaters (elected)

There follows a humorous article in which the candidates are described as if participants in a horse race.  From this it would seem that there was also a nomination for King Ward for which there is a reference to ‘Phil’. 

The editor then takes up more serious comment on the nomination of W.T. Rabbich.

[It is no surprise after the actions of Rabbich in the Town Council lately that the editor is opposed to his candidacy.  He reprints Rabbich’s evidence before the Commission on Main Roads in 1892, which tends to make Rabbich appear as a fool.  He says this is relevant because looking after roads is one of the main functions of District Councils.]

The editor says:

‘The public will have no difficulty in estimating from this evidence the peculiar claims this gentleman (?) will have on the unanimous support of the ratepayers; they will be able to recognise his statesmanlike grasp of the whole subject; his intimate acquaintance with the fact of what are main and what are other roads, his truthful statements as to the traffic, his lofty sentiments as to the claims of residents outside the Corporation, boundary and the eternal debt of gratitude which would have been his due from the ratepayers of the Burra, Hanson, and Booborowie Councils had he succeeded in taking the road from the Burra Station to Hallett’s woolshed and the branch to Leighton, altogether over fourteen miles in length off the schedule of main roads and putting on instead a miserable twenty-eight chains within the Corporation boundary, at the same time throwing the repair of the north road from the railway-station by the new bridge to the north end of Ford’s property on the funds of the Corporation.’

Rabbich requests a road be added as a main road: that running west from the Bon Accord, and is asked why he requests it.  [Copperhouse St]

Rabbich: The road although within Council boundaries ‘is not used by the ratepayers of the municipality’.   We have maintained it because it is an approach to the town and not simply as a convenience to ratepayers, but to the public that comes into the town.  The road we ask for is the ‘main entrance to the town’ and from the town there is a great deal of traffic.  It drains the country from the west and also ‘from the east and from the north country’ though this is not so much settled as it is to the west.  There are of course two mills at the north end of town and the stock sales.  Farmers from the west bring wheat to the mills and the station and stock to stock sales and vehicle traffic ‘all go over this road’.  A large number of sheep for sale go over this road.  Considering that the road is used more by the outside public than by the ratepayers it is right that the public generally should maintain it and not ‘the people of the town, who do not use it at all’.

[He then goes on at some length about how the sheep cut up the road.]

Mr Lake asked how much it cost p.a. to maintain the 28 chains and was told £10-£15.

[Rabbich then gets vague about how many farmers there were to the west who used the road and also said in answer to a question that he thought there were about five miles of main road within the Corporation.

Commissioner: But all the main roads leading into Burra, into Kooringa and Redruth, are main roads, are they not?  ‘No.’

Commissioner:  The road from the east is on the schedule? The road from Kooringa east is on the schedule, and the one from Aberdeen?

Rabbich: The one leading south is not on the schedule.

Commissioner:  Not towards Sod Hut?  ‘No.’

Commissioner: Past the Hospital: south from the Hospital?  ‘Yes; I beg your pardon, I think it is.’

Commissioner: Do you know whether Hanson is asking for the extension of their road to Gum Creek:  ‘Yes.’

Is it necessary to have two roads on?
