As midnight approached the hall was filled with merrymakers when ‘Father Time’ appeared singing his farewell (Prisoner’s Song) and was dismissed at the 12 o’clock chimes, to be replaced by the 1948 Babe, complete with ‘Bottle’ and all joined in singing Auld Lang Syne.  The 1948 Babe rolled in a gaily decorated barrel filled with all manner of squeakers and all joined in singing Roll Out the Barrel.
