A voice said the company paid a 5% dividend, but the Mayor said that over the years of operation that would work out at 1% p.a.

Mr Wicklein asked if ‘The Guns’ were to stay where they were.  The Mayor said yes.

Cr Jennison thought they should return to the monument – as soon as it could be afforded.

After some further questions about road maintenance the meeting closed.
