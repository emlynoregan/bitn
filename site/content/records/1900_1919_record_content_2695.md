Fire.  On Sunday night Mrs P. Callahan went to bed leaving a candle burning in a box at the foot of the bed.  At 11 o’clock M-C Jemison was attracted by a woman’s screams and rushed in to save a young child of three and to extinguish the flames.  Some clothing was destroyed and only the constable’s swift actions saved the house.
