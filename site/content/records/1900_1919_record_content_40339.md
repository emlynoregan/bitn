Pearce’s Buildings are now practically finished.  There are two suites of offices on the ground floor, occupied by Mr Winnall and Mr Jeanes, the Federal Division Returning Officer.  At the rear is a small hall 33’ x 26’ to be let for meetings, parties etc.  Two suites of offices upstairs are yet to be let.  The building is most imposing.
