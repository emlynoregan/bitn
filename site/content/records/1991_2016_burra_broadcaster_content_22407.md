Burra CWA made a series of donations to local charities and organisations at a special afternoon tea gathering in the Old Courthouse on 26 May.

President Barbara Frances said Burra was where the first [SA] branch of the CWA was formed by the late Mary Warnes in 1926.  During its early life the branch had a strong membership and clubrooms were built on land in Chapel St on land donated by the Warnes family.  They were opened in 1961, but over the years membership declined and in 1991 it was resolved that the small numbers of members could not maintain the building and it was reluctantly sold.  The proceeds were invested and the income used to help many organisations.  A recent decision was made to give some of the branchâ€™s funds to the community, so cheques were presented to:

Mr Bob McEvoy, Executive Director of the Heart Foundation

Mr Alan Jones, Donor Development Officer for the Anti-Cancer Foundation

Mr Craig Stanbridge, CEO of the Burra/Clare/Snowtown Hospitals

Maureen Wright, President of the Burra Burra Branch of the National Trust of SA

John Brak, Senior Administration Officer of the Regional Council of Goyder

Mr Ron Shipard, of the Burra Ambulance Board

Mr Len Newcombe, Secretary of Burra Burra Show Society

Over the last decade the CWA has made generous donations to many organisations including the Lions Club bus for seniors, SES, Bushfire Appeal, Little athletics, Burra Hospital, the Ambulance Service, Burra Kindergarten, Flood Relief Appeal, Lymphoedema Assessment Clinic, the bone densitometry unit, RFDS, the Lady Nell Seeing Eye Dog and the Dorothy Dolling Memorial Trust for the provision of training and rehabilitation for rural women and children.  $2,000 has been given towards the creation of a new community room in Market Square, which has been named the Mary Warnes Community Room.
