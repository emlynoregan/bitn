Transforming Burra Creek.  An action plan to transform the Burra Creek was launched on Monday night in the Burra Town Hall.  Consultants EBS Ecology have developed a plan for the Burra Revegetation Group for the transformation of the Burra Creek between the Golf Course and the Cemetery.  Over ten years the plan calls for 26,000 plants to be placed and for this year plants have been ordered along with tree guards and soil conditioner.  As well as plants, the plan envisages walking and riding trails, picnic areas and interpretive signs.  Rob Perry, as Chair of the Burra Revegetation Group, said the BRG was keen to have the input of ideas and comments from interested people.  Funds for the plan were provided by the SA Murray Darling Basin Natural Resources Management Board with support from the Goyder Council.
