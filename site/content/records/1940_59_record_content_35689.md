Local Health Board

The Primary Producers’ Assistance Board advised it could not proceed with the Health Board’s request to expedite the matter of milk deliveries in Burra until it had income and expenditure details from Burra milk vendors.  If these were satisfactory they were prepared to recommend that the vendors be charged 1/9 per gallon and be allowed to sell at 4½d a pint.  The 1/9 plus the government subsidy would give the producer 45/12d more than the amount received by city producers.
