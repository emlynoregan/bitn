Burra Youth Club will meet in the old Salvation Army Hall opposite the Burra dry Cleaners from 26 June.  This will be more convenient as the majority of members come from the south end of town and also because they will have exclusive use of the building.  It is intended to form an Adult Advisory Committee.  The idea is to form a coffee bar type club where teenagers can drop in for a game, record session, dance and chat.  The club is affiliated with SA Youth Clubs who run a variety of competitions through the year â€“ indoor bowls, darts, dominos, volley ball, table tennis, vaulting apparatus, basket work, art, a library and weekend activities.
