Confessions of a Gold Seeker – a letter signed I.X.

Our party of four men sailed from Port Adelaide in the Margaret Brock on Monday 22 December 1851.  We reached Port Phillip the following Sunday.  It was impossible to find lodgings and we spent Monday night in a deserted house with a group of four Germans.  The next day we got breakfast with some difficulty and eventually found a man who engaged to take us to the diggings.  We paid him £1 each for taking our carpet-bags etc. and for the privilege of walking alongside his cart.  After about 2 miles he left us to camp at a filthy waterhole and returned to Melbourne with his horse.  He returned about 4.30 p.m. and we continued.  The landscape looked like a vast sheep run.  After three days we had gone 30 miles and we camped in a wood and endured a miserably cold and wet night.  On the sixth day we arrived at the diggings, which had the appearance of a giant graveyard.  The diggers looked grim and anxious.  The slaughter-yards exhaled a vile stench.  We recognised many men, but they were too absorbed in their activities to pass the time of day.  Provisions were cheaper than we expected.  My friends left me in charge of the tent and luggage for a few hours and, it being a hot day, I suffered sunstroke, becoming giddy and subject to violent retching.  Eventually my three mates returned.  I spent a fitful night with sleep punctuated by pistol shots, barking dogs and the sound of horses and hobbles.  We set to work the next day and in four days had struck pipe-clay at 10 ft, despite bouts of dysentery.  We had obtained about two ounces of gold, but by them I was too weak to continue.  I started for Melbourne with a damper and a driver of a cart who took £1 for the conveyance of by bundles.  After five miles, while watering the horses, the whole affair ended up in the water and emerged covered with mud, dust and water.  Four miles on, we stopped for tea and ate the damper after peeling off a layer of mud.  [He then continues describing a miserable trip to Melbourne lasting several more days.]

After a night at the Freemasons Family Hotel I procured employment and lodgings, among those whose coarseness of language and behaviour repelled.  The night was spent in a room occupied by a drunken snoring man, thousands of bedbugs and a multitude of mosquitoes.  I did not sleep a wink and at before dawn had fled.  By the next night I had managed to find lodgings with a respectable family, with whom I stayed for three weeks before taking the Maid of Auckland to Port Adelaide on Sunday 1 February and reached Adelaide on Monday 9 February.

‘I have only to add that I believe gold to exist in Victoria in vast abundance, yet that hundreds are there who curse the day that they left South Australia and that there is more morality observable at the diggings than in Melbourne.’  I shall probably go again to the diggings when the rains set in, but I would not take my family to reside in Melbourne.
