Burra Institute, Committee Meeting.

The committee accepted the tender of T. & C. Tiver for the masonry work for the new room for £56-10-0 and that of C. & A. Fuss for the carpentry at £66.

President (S. Lane) and Mr Winnall have seen Mr Lester of Theatregraph Pictures and arranged that from 1 September he have the hall regularly on Fridays for 12 months.  Anyone wishing to have the hall on a Friday is to negotiate with him to waive his right for a consideration.  Mr McLaren did not approve of this.  The others however, did, as it was a paying proposition.  The agreement, as Mr Nield pointed out, expired before the next run of fetes and need not be renewed if it caused trouble.

The Institute was in credit c. £300.

The issue of replacing the forms without backs was raised, but storage for forms with backs was not available and individual chairs would not last.  It was resolved to get illustrations and prices for various alternatives.
