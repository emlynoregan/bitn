Australia Day at Hallett was held 27 July and was a great success.  It is reported in 1½ columns.  The Burra Ladies’ band attended.  It led the parade from the Institute to the recreation grounds and played selections in the afternoon.  The crowd was addressed by the Chairman of the Hallett DC, T.E. Richards, and by the Mayor of Burra, Mr Crewes.  There was a concert in the evening and over £370 was raised.
