Burra Methodist Church.

The recent Pleasant Sunday Afternoon raised just over $100 and the young people have since raised another $100.  The church has arranged for the screening of the new film Australian Football in the Town Hall on Wednesday 26 August, which will also aid the United Development Appeal.
