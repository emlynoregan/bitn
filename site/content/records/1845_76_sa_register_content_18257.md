J. Rounsevell writes from Kapunda 13 February.

[He is responding to a recent paragraph in the Register stating that great inconvenience had been caused by the stopping of the Blinman [mail] cart.]

I have not run a cart there for some years, but continue to run an American wagon.  I now find it impossible to run quite up to the Mine because of the deplorable state of the north this season.  Not only the mail horses, but the stock on the runs are dying by thousands and I cannot carry the mail with horses, but carry it on foot above the Blinman.  Many stations are having to distribute their rations on foot and overseers themselves are driving wheelbarrows with loads as far as six miles out at a time.

The anti-squatters should see the country before talking and writing so much and they would then have a better idea of what the squatters should pay.  Not one of them would take nine out of ten of the runs in the north at cost price, without rent.  Should we get some rain and feed the mail conveyance will run again – if needed – but now everyone who can has left and travelling is at an end except on foot with a canteen on your back.  If we get another season like this the north will be deserted.
