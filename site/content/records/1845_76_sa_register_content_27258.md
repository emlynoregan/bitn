The late Railway accident at Peak’s Crossing

Memorandum of James P. Boucaut, Commissioner of Public Works:

I have carefully read over the printed reports of the coroner’s inquest and have gone through the same line by line with the Engineer-in-Chief, who has thoroughly gone through the causes of the accident and who attended the inquest.  The accident is to be attributed to the absence of the inspection of the line by the walking ganger in accordance with the regulations.  This neglect is a direct consequence of the circular issued by Branford directing ganger not to walk the line.  This circular was not authorised by any superior authority and was not reported by Branford.  It was subject to those objections under the old regulations and directly contrary to the new regulations of 24 September 1875.  On receipt of these regulations Branford should have revoked the circulare, even if he had the impression it was authorised under the old regulations (however erroneous that impression may have been).  Consequently there is no alternative but for the Engineer-in-Chief to recommend and for me to concur in the immediate dismissal of Inspector Branford, who is therefore dismissed accordingly.  It is with regret that this necessity is pursued with respect to a public servant who has faithfully discharged his duties for a period of 20 years.
