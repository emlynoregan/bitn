Rev. W.G.M. Murphy spoke on The church and the Aborigines, though he drifted somewhat into employment for the poor, following the lead of the previous speaker.  He wondered why sweatshop workers didnâ€™t go into domestic service where they would be paid more and get better status.  [The report reveals very little about what he may have had to say about Aborigines.]
