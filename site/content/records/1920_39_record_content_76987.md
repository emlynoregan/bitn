Obituary.  Otto H. [Hjalmar] Aberg died 31 October.  He was born in Sweden in 1873 and migrated to Australia as a young man, beginning a butchering business in Scone NSW.  He then travelled widely in Australia and came into contact with the Salvation Army in Northam WA and entered the Salvation Army Training Garrison in Melbourne.  In 1900 he transferred to SA as assistant officer at Adelaide and Burra.  He later commanded a number of Sa & Victorian Corps.  While at Heywood in Victoria his health failed and he had to resign from the Salvation Army and take 12 months rest.  After that he recommenced butchering at Hamilton in Victoria for 14 years.  He came back to SA and to Burra in 1933.  With aid of his sons he built up a successful business here.  He had a high reputation as a businessman and a townsman and did much good work with the Salvation Army Corps here.  He was of great assistance to the lady officers in charge here during the recent improvements to the hall.  On 2 March 1904 he married Edith Phillips at the Burra Citadel.  She is the third daughter of the late Mr & Mrs Joseph Phillips of Waterloo and there are four children: Frank, Hartley & Ruth Mrs Garrett, all of Burra and Captain Marion Aberg of McBride Hospital Adelaide who nursed her father through his final illness.  There are five grandchildren.
