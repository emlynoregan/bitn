Booborowie Institute held its AGM.  For the past year running expenses of c. £165 exceeded income by about £5.  The Project Account held £4,300 for building additions and was projected to reach £4,800 by the year’s end, with barley dividends and interest yet to come.  The supper room has been delayed, waiting for specifications and to have used an architect would have added to the cost, which is already expected to be £5,000 to £6,000.  Specifications are expected within a fortnight.  The plans envisage two front rooms, each 12ft x 14 ft and a passage 8 ft wide, with a supper room on the north side about 38 ft x 24 ft with a new kitchen.  Acting Chairman A.W. Pearce suggested another cropping project was probably the best option for raising the money required.  He thought building should begin before approaching the public again.  This provoked considerable discussion.  A close vote approved getting the cropping plan going this season.
