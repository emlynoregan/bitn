Concerned Burra & District Residents Group members met with the Shadow Health Minister Duncan McFetridge & Dan Van Holst Pellekaan MP lat week to discuss the ongoing problems about emergency and accident care at Burra Hospital.  They also discussed the Social Development Committee of the SA Parliament’s inquiry into country health.  This is expected to take some months to finalise its report.  The group also said they had made a submission to the Federal Parliament’s Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, currently inquiring into the registration and support for overseas trained doctors.  It is hoped that the group’s contribution will lead to improvements in country health services.
