Accident.  Lewis Gare was driving his young son to his fatherâ€™s house on Mt Pleasant a few days ago when a bullet from a pea rifle passed through and shattered the side glass windscreen and apparently went out the other side of the car.  The escape of the pair from death or injury was very lucky indeed.
