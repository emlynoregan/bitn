Anzac Services and parades were held at Burra, Riverton, Saddleworth, Booborowie and Hallett on Sunday.  The weather at Burra was perfect for the March and Service at the Memorial in Market Square at which Rev. T.G. Drought and Rev. R.S. Jenner officiated.  Thirty-six members of the local RSL took part in the march, led by the Port Pirie Pipersâ€™ Band, which also played at the Burra Hospital from 1-2 p.m.  Wreaths were laid by Vice-President H. Cornelius for the RSL, President T.R. Rogers for the Air Force Association,  A.C. Heinrich for Demobilised Soldiers, E.T. Baulderstone for the Town Council and T.G. Perry as District Clerk for the DC.  The public attendance was poor.
