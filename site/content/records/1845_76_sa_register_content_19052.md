Mr Stead asked whether the Mine would be developed without going to the additional expense of purchasing machinery.  The Secretary said further development would require extra outlay.  They had the machinery, but would have to erect it and would have to sink a new shaft and communicate it to Morphett’s Shaft.

Mr Samuel Tomkinson said that after the explanation given by the Secretary it was clear that it would have been advantageous if operations had ceased for the past 12 months because apparently they had been raising ore and giving it away.  He was therefore pleased to receive the original plan proposed by the Directors.

The difference with the proposal from London was that it allowed an opportunity for shareholders who wished it, of retiring from the Association.  He thought the sum of £150,000 was too low, taking the Mine together with the great quantity of valuable land in connection with it.  While it was true the value of the Mine might diminish, nevertheless, £350,477 was not a very large amount if it was a mine at all.  He believed the Karkulto property would permit of development in its present state.  He thought the shareholders needed time to think it over and to communicate with those whom they represented.  This would also allow time for communication with London – say four or five months – to see whether the London promoters would raise their offer to something like a proper amount.

Mr Blyth MP sought clarification.   He understood the London promoters undertook to provide a sum of £70,000 with the view to the formation of a new company.  It was fair to assume then, that under the arrangement proposed the new company expected to realise some degree of profit over and above that which the development of the mine would afford and that they would secure additional profit by putting in the London market so valuable a property as these mines, the reputation of which had become a matter of notoriety.

Was it intended that the profit so arising should be divided among the shareholders who joined the new scheme.  As to the offer of £61 per share for those desirous of retiring from the Association, he thought that by waiting a few months they might get a good deal more than £61 per share.

The Chairman said there was no question that the profits would be divided equally.

Hon. W. Peacock said it must be so or he, as the largest shareholder in the colony, would not consent to the plan.  The Secretary agreed that he was quite sure all shareholders were to be treated equally.

It was resolved that the Directors proceed with the development of the Mine as suggested in the proposition of the Association of 2 October 1865.

Mr Glyde said the price of shares last week was £65, but that had decreased as a consequence of the offer.

Mr Peacock said the London proposal was better for those desirous of retiring from the Association.

Mr Thomas Graves thought it would be an advantage to have gentlemen at home [i.e. in England] to look after the interests of the company.

The Chairman thought it was the intention of the gentlemen in England to issue for every £60 share four of £20 each.  The secretary said it was believed £20 shares would be more suitable for the London Market.

It was resolved that the Directors would communicate with the London gentlemen with a view to their increasing the amount of the offer and that a draft prospectus of the intended new company be transmitted to Adelaide.  In the meantime the representatives of absentee shareholders would consult their principals.
