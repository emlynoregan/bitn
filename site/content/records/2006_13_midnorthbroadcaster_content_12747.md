The Rural Doctors Workforce Agency CEO Lyn Poole attended the Goyder Council meeting on Tuesday to discuss the current situation regarding the process of recruiting a doctor for Burra.  Dr Lakman Fernando and other interested community members were also there.  Ms Poole said the recruited doctor’s credentials and documentation would be presented to the Medical Board this week.  If successful they will then start the process of visas.  That could see the doctor here in the next two or three months.  The new doctor will be able to assist in the practice, but emergency privileges will only be made possible by 24-hour supervision by part-time doctor Lakman Fernando, who has been granted emergency privileges.  We have a doctor here all the time who does not have and chooses not to have privileges, Ms Poole said.  The Medical Board requires some form of supervision of any international doctor who’s not fellowed.  They can get that within two to three years and the RWDA encourages them.  The process of getting the new doctor in place can be expected to take from two to six months.
