Burra Town Council

The Town Clerk explained that he had been paid by the Mayor to write his report for the year because of Mr Collins’s workload.  The Mayor had been hurt by the impression that he was not capable of writing the report.

Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. wrote to say concerning the £16-10-0 per acre agreed to for the purchase of closed roads that they find there is no title and it will therefore cost an extra £10-£15.  They therefore considered a reduction in the cost of the land was justified.  After consideration the Council decided not to reduce the cost.

Wright’s Motors were given permission to erect three bowsers in front of their garage.

W.M. Heath was given permission to erect a new dwelling in Thames St.

Mr Villis offered to buy Reserve No. 6 comprising Creek Lands near the Vacuum Oil Co. works and No. 7 comprising Creek Lands from Bon Accord Bridge to the railway line.  The Mayor was opposed and a decision was deferred pending an inspection.
