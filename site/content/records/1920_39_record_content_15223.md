Ministerial Visit to Booborowie

Hon. T. Butterfield, Commissioner of Crown Lands

Mr O’Halloran, Chairman of the Railways Standing Committee

Mr Hawke MP & Hon. Blesing MLC

Leaseholders of the recently divided stock road sought reduced rents and change to covenant of purchase from perpetual lease (which would also reduce land tax and council assessment values).  Evidence of the very high valuations for leaseholds was given.  The Commissioner was sympathetic, but said conversion to freehold was not favoured, as it could see land drift back into large holdings.

A request was made that Ayers Forest Crown Lands be resumed for closer settlement.

A deputation asked to sell the existing site of the Council office and to build a new chamber, as the present chamber was two miles from the town and inconvenient.

A deputation asked that Canowie Township of c. 100 acres be resumed and vested in the Council as parklands, to be used as commonage.

A request was made that hospital rates be on the basis of population and not land value.  At present rates per head of population varied from 2/2 for the Burra Town Council to 10/10 for the Burra District Council.

The Railway.  In 1915 it was calculated that the cost would be £6,019 per mile to build and that the annual loss would be £654.

In the evening a meeting was held to consider the proposed railway further.

[Most of the discussion as reported appeared to be political waffle from the official party and nothing of substance about the actual Hanson-Booborowie line is reported.]
