C.W. Gare of Burra, who has been connected with Council and other civic interests for many years, is retiring after 41 years’ continuous service with the DC of Hallett.  He was first elected for Banbury Ward on 3 July 1909.  He took a keen interest in the building of the Hallett Institute in 1928.  He was elected Chairman of the Council on 8 July 1933 and held that office till 1 July 1940.  Other Chairmen during his time on Council have been C.W. Bowman, T.E. Richards, W.S. Murray and the present Chairman, W.G. Miller.  In 1935 the DC of Hallett amalgamated with the DC of Terowie and parts of the DCs of Booborowie and Belalie.  The New Council continued as the DC of Hallett, comprising seven wards with one Councillor from each ward.  He was then the sole Councillor for Banbury Ward until the present.  On 4 July 1938 he became the DC of Hallett’s representative on the Burra Hospital Board and has held the position until now.  During the whole period of his service he has sacrificed much of his time in the interests of the community.  His son, Mr L.W. Gare will succeed him as Councillor for Banbury Ward at the meeting of Council in July this year.
