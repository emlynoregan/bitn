Violet Day

This was celebrated on 24 June in excellent weather and a monster procession headed by the Ladies’ band went from the railway station to Kooringa where the usual speeches were given.  A bunch of violets was sold for £250 under the Bugler system.  The usual stalls etc. operated and there was a concert in the evening by the Adelaide Curlew Concert Party.  Proceeds amounted to c. £550.  At the service in Market Square over 100 wreaths were hung by relatives and friends around the rotunda and Brigadier-General Forsayth delivered a most eloquent speech.
