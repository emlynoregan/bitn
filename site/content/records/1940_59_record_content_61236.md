Assessment Proposals

New proposals circulated by the Municipal and Local Government Assoc. for assessments based on sections of both the Annual and Land Values Systems presently in use have been rejected by all Councils in this section of the state.  The Burra town Council, which has been getting further into debt, has recently adopted the E & WS values for its assessment.  Many ratepayers consider this treats them harshly and some anomalies are apparent.  Nevertheless the Council has to have revenue to retain services.  Judging by the state of roads the Burra Burra DC is also short of funds.  The Annual Values System, currently in use, encourages speculators to hold vacant blocks because they pay minimal rates on them, but if a person buys and develops the site he is immediately hit by a heavy rate, despite adding to the townâ€™s progress.  The Unimproved Land Value system seems to answer this problem and is used throughout Queensland and in many SA Councils.
