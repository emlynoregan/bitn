Marie Abbott of Burra celebrated her 99th birthday recently.  Mrs Abbott still lives independently in her own home and was joined on the occasion by family members, including her sister Kath Scholz, who celebrated her 95th birthday and son Leo, who was celebrating his 70th.  Mrs Abbott was born Marie Hogan at Leighton and lived there with her parents until marrying Leo Abbott in 1940.  She attended Leighton school till aged 10 and then went with her sister Dorothy as boarders at the St Joseph’s Convent in Spalding after it was built in 1921.  The subjects included reading, spelling, copybook writing, religion and music.  When Marie first went to school she went by horse and cart.  She went on to teach music, travelling around the Booborowie area with her violin, by horse and sulky.  When she drove some 10 miles beyond Booborowie she would stay overnight.  On one such trip with her brother they had an accident and the violin got broken.  Mrs Abbott also continued to play the piano well and played the organ at church until she was 90.  Singing around the piano with family and friends was a popular form of entertainment in the time before television.  She also went to her grandparents’ home to listen to concerts on the wireless.  Card games such as bridge and euchre also provided entertainment.  On special occasions the family would travel to a neighbour’s and listen to the commentary on the wireless of the test matches when Australia played England for the Ashes.  Of the changes she has seen, cars, TV and telephones perhaps had most impact.  Washing machines also made a big difference.  She recalls using a scrubbing board to do the clothes.  When she got married they lived in a prefab house with no insulation and a wood stove.  There was no refrigerator.  Not until after her third child did they get a kerosene refrigerator.  Mrs Abbot can’t remember what year they got electricity, but it certainly made getting hot water easier.
