The Mayor referred to the letter to the paper in which Cr Button referred to the failure to burn grass along the creek and to the unfairness of the amount of attention given to North Ward over the interests of Kooringa.  He asked who it was that Cr Button accused of failing to act.  Most of the creek was rented out and Council could not burn grass for which it had been paid.  In the period of Christmas relief the Mayor said he had given the Overseer instructions to clean up where required.  All the creeks had been burned from Kangaroo St to the back of John Kellock’s.  While Cr Button was writing his letter the Mayor was working up a case for better water supply and presenting it to the Commissioner.  As for North Ward preference for tarring, after inspection it had been decided to do 2½ chains in the North Ward, 5 in East Ward and 36 in West Ward.  Except for Christmas relief there had not been £10 spent in North Ward in six months.
