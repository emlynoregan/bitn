An Autobiographical sketch by William Trembath is printed.

I was born at Kooringa, county Burra on 13 May 1851.  When very Young was sent to a private school run by Mr O…d – thoroughly educated himself, but lacking the essential skills for becoming an efficient teacher.  Dissatisfied with my progress, my parents then transferred me to the tuition of Mr Sk…s, where I obtained the greatest portion of my education.  Here discipline was harsh and I often went home with smarting hands or sore shoulders from the strap.  They said it was for being pert and forward, naughty and insolent and was therefore just.  (I doubt it.)  At 12 years of age I went to Mr W…s Commercial Academy, where I was successful and gained praise for general proficiency.  Mr W. was a person of thoroughly classical attainments and had a most efficient mode of teaching.  In early life I had an almost unconquerable love of horses and was never happier than when on horseback, riding recklessly and assisting in mustering horses or cattle or on a day’s kangaroo hunt. I frequently visited the North Eastern Plains, the Murray, Kitchowla [Ketchowla] and Baldino [Baldina] all picturesque and lovely spots and happy days around a campfire with merry songs and romantic tales.

[The school teachers suggested here would seem to be:

Thomas and Mary Oakford who had a school in the old Bible Christian Chapel in Market Square 1853-65.

W…s would refer to Mr & Mrs F.R. White’s school established in 1863.

Sk…s has not been identified, but could be a mistaken transcription for John Stephens (St…s) who ran the Wesleyan Day School 1857-72.]
