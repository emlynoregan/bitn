Obituary.  Mr E.R. Gill died suddenly at the residence of his brother Mr E.E. Gill of Spalding.  Edwin Roderick Gill was born in Torquay, England in 1870.  He migrated with his parents the late Edwin & Jemima Gill and six Brothers in the Camperdown 66 years ago.  The family settled in the Hallett district.  Schooling was hard to come by in the area and the young Gill brothers worked at various farms.  On becoming an adult the deceased worked at Cappeedee Station and later on Booborowie Station.  In 1896 he went to Broken Hill as a miner for about 13 years.  Also in 1896 he married Margaret May Bannan of Blumberg (Birdwood).  In 1909 he moved to Spalding and became the proprietor of the Spalding Hotel.  After three years he came to Booborowie and was a farmer for about 15 years.  He was a very genial and popular man and had a mass of information on minerals and rocks.  His wife died 13 months ago.  Of three sons only Leo at Booborowie survives.  He is survived by two brothers and one sister: George (WA), Arthur (Yorketown) & Mrs Smith (WA).

[Died 24 June 1943 at Spalding.]
