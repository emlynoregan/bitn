Emma and James Hugh ran the store, while James continued with contracting work, having up to 100 men employed by him at times.  He helped to build the Wallaroo Smelting Works, macadamised roads in the Burra district, the Aberdeen Ford, Redruth Bridge, the Burra Institute, the station yards and station and railway houses from Tarlee to Farrell Flat.  James opened a branch store at Hallett after the railway reached there in 1878 and later took up land at McVitties Flat, Hallett, Banbury, and with his sons, Pat’s Well, Yunta (later known as ‘Tiverton’).  James was a Town Councillor [December 1883 to November 1887], a JP, Superintendent of the [Redruth Wesleyan/Methodist] Sunday School and an office bearer in the [Redruth Methodist] Church for many years.  He was also connected with the Oddfellows and Masonic Lodges for most of his life.

[The list of buildings etc. attributed to James Tiver should not be taken at face value.  They need to be checked carefully.  Two observations indicate the care needed:

The Redruth Bridge that is still there, although disused, dates from 1879.  It is a steel bridge and was erected by Duncan Grant.  It replaced a timber bridge erected in 1861, for which Tiver constructed the masonry abutments.  It may be that these abutments were used again for the replacement bridge.

James Tiver got the contract for the last half mile of the railway line into the Burra Station and associated work.  He seems to have been responsible for the platforms/wharfs and may well have been responsible for the 1870 railway station.  BUT the existing railway station was erected only in 1883 by Sara & Dunstan.]
