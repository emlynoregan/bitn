World War II Home Front in Burra.  Research by Mandy Scott, BCS Year 12 History.

Just under 400 men and women joined the armed forces from Burra, excluding the district.

War Effort Organisations included:

Burra Red Cross Branch

Fighting Forces Comfort Fund 109

RSL Wives (and later Relatives) Group

Burra Civil Defence League

Burra Burra Show War Committee

Hospital War Effort

Burra & District Soldiers Farewell Committee

Recruiting rallies were held in the Burra Institute, usually on Fridays when shops were asked to close early at 8 p.m.

Rationing was imposed and petrol rationing was a real problem.

Burra Clothing Factory opened in October 1944 [in the present Goyder Council Office] making uniforms for troops.  Girls earned from 20 shillings to 75 shillings a week depending on experience and age.

Trenches and air raid shelters were constructed at Burra School in March 1942 by a working bee of 150 men.

Burra Civil Defence League organised a round the clock watch on the skies for enemy planes.  [From the Record photographic Studio.’

By 1945 Burra Branch of the Red Cross was one of the largest country branches.

By 1944 the FFCF 109 had raised over £1,000 for the war effort.

Burra Show was cancelled in 1940 and the Committee directed its efforts to war work.  They raised £1,000 towards the purchase of two ambulances.  (Each cost about £600.)

In June 1940 the Red Cross Ambulance Fund opened an appeal for funds and by August had sent £500 to Adelaide.
