Cricket.  Completion of games:

Koonoona 3 for 121 declared and 2 for 67 defeated Farrell Flat 67 & 113.

Buffs 144 defeated Burra 130.  (Each played one innings.)

Burra Rifle Club fired the 12th stage of the Kookaburra Trophy.  Possibles were scored by Jim Brown, Ken Heinrich and M. Kakoschke.  [Though the description of the above does not seem to quite match the scores given.]  Jim Brown came first in both the marksmanâ€™s and handicap competitions on the day.
