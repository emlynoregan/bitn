Armistice Day fell on Sunday and so the usual observances were not held locally, but at Redruth Methodist Church a two-minute silence was observed at 11 a.m. and an Armistice Service was held in the evening.  At Kooringa Methodist Church an Armistice Service was held in the morning.

The Burra District Band was at practice on Sunday morning and adjourned to the yard at the rear of the hall to observe the 11 a.m. silence.  They played O God Our Help followed by Last Post and Reveille.
