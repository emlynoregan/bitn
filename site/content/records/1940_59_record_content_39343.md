Anglican Reunion at ‘Baldina’ Homestead

More than 200 members and former members of the parish gathered at ‘Baldina’ on Saturday last.  They came by private car and a busload as well.  They were welcomed by Mr & Mrs J.R. Barker.  They spread themselves around the beautiful garden enjoying and admiring both the beauty of the flowers and the splendid vegetable garden.  Many were fascinated by the large lily pond, with its fish and by the emu enclosure, which includes one emu said to be about 74 years old.  Tables and chairs were spread under the trees and a very good afternoon tea was served.
