Burra Brass Band held its AGM on 8 November.  Secretary J.T. Pascoe presented the 2nd annual report.  The band has made real progress.  It has played five concerts, assisted at a Leighton Continental, Anzac Service, football match, and played for four dances.  It has bought three instruments and 23 full uniforms and new music for dances and having spent £90-£100 remains £8-6-9 in credit.  The band performed creditably at the Spalding Competitions.  Much is due to bandmaster J.H. Murison.  Elected were Patron, James Thomas; President, E.F. Marston; Bandmaster, J.H. Murison; Treasurer, J. Allen Sen. and Secretary, J.T. Pascoe.  Thanks go to Mr P.W. Clark for the use of his room at low rental.
