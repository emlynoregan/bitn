Editorial on the Agricultural Bureau

The editor discusses the advantages of such an organisation especially in encouraging innovation in agriculture.  New varieties of wheat such as early and late have been tried etc.  There is a flow-on for domestic gardens too.  The local branch is enthusiastic and splendid work is being done.  [Though it has been little reported.]
