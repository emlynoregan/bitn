Strike at Burra Burra

Late editions of the Adelaide Observer on Saturday 18 September carried the first announcement of a disturbance at the Burra Burra Mines.

Observer Office 9 o’clock

An express messenger left Burra Burra last evening and in little more than eleven hours arrived in Adelaide seeking 20 members of the police force, or as many as can be spared.  Three hundred miners who feel aggrieved by the proprietor’s assays are in absolute possession of the mine and will not allow any ore to be removed.

Rebellious miners are coercing the more peaceful by taking them into the bush to prevent their interference.  It is also said that so serious a disagreement has arisen between the Directors and Mine Superintendent Mr Burr that no chance of conciliation remains.  It is thought Mr Burr will not resign and this unfortunate coincidence adds to the alarming state of affairs there.

Observer Office 12 o’clock

Mr Burra has reached Adelaide.  Lieut. Dashwood, Inspector Tolmer and about a score of mounted police are preparing to leave for the mine accompanied by Mr Paxton, one of the directors.  It is reported that Mr Lang, the Resident Magistrate and Mr Walters of the Copper Co. have both been maltreated by the rioters.

This news, on a more careful reading of reports, was seen to be false; there being merely an apprehension of violence and the request for police was a wise measure of precaution on the part of the Resident Magistrate.

Yesterday’s South Australian published an account of the events leading to the present situation.

About 10 days ago SAMA decided to dispense with the service of Superintendent Thomas Burra.  He was informed in writing.  Messrs Beck (Chairman), Ellis and Kingston, members of the Board, proceeded to the mine with Secretary, Henry Ayers, to carry out the resolution of the Board.  They arrived on Thursday and on Friday relieved Mr Burr (who refused to resign) of his duties.  Mr Burra then left for Adelaide.  The miners, upon hearing of the arrival of the Directors, took the opportunity to apply to them for redress of alleged grievances.  The Directors refused to meet their deputation and they were told work would be stopped.

This greatly disturbed the tributers as there was several thousand pounds worth of work done by them, for which they would not be paid until the completion of their sets.  They then apparently decided to take possession of the mine so that none of the miners could be paid and it would be in the interests of all that a settlement be obtained from the Association.

The system for assays is that when each miner’s ore is cleaned and dressed, it is divided into three parts.  A specimen is taken from each part, one for the miner, one for the Superintendent or Captain and one for the Directors in Adelaide.  Until recently the assay at the mine was agreed to by both parties.  The Directors, having become dissatisfied, had several assays done in Adelaide and concluded that Mr Elphick, a chemist of Rundle Street, was the most correct assayer.  He has been appointed assayer to the mines.  However, the miners are as dissatisfied with the assays at Adelaide as the Directors were with those at the mine, especially as recently the analyses have recently not been reported in an authenticated form, but only by a letter from the Secretary.

Mr Burra was accused of failing to fulfil instructions to raise only ore of at least 25%.  He allowed lower grade ore to be raised and this was paid for at the higher rate.  Mr Burra alleges that it is the Captains that are charged with that duty and utterly denies the correctness of the charges against him.

Mr Doran of the Royal Admiral left the mines on Sunday.  He reports that men who refused to strike were tied back to back and carried through the town.  When the Directors orders the police to arrest the ring-leaders a corporal was stoned and forced to retreat.  The miners had made a disturbance at the Burra Burra Hotel and had assaulted one of the Directors or Mr Ayers.  About 400 miners are on strike and they say they are determined to have their rights.

Yesterday the South Australian printed a report from their correspondent at the Burra Burra Hotel at 4.30 a.m. Monday.

It is reported that on Thursday the miners appointed a committee to meet with the Directors and lay before them complaints about the mode of assaying adopted, through which they feel they are getting less than fair value.  They also allege that they have not received payment for much ore now lying on the ground or actually removed.  This the Directors deny.

The Directors refused to meet the Committee, but have offered to submit assays to two parties – one to be named by each, to divide any discrepancies not greater than 1% and to refer greater discrepancies to a third party.  Upon the men resuming work they are prepared to hear individual complaints.  The men have placed in the Directors’ hands a document declaring they will not return to work until the matter is settled and not to allow any ore, upon which they consider they have a lien, to be removed.  No answer has yet been received.

The works are at a standstill, but the miners have not interfered with the removal of ore not raised on tribute.

Two men who went to the mine of Friday morning were bound back to back and carried around the mine and town on a barrow, followed by a mob numbering hundreds.

Police Constable Brooks endeavoured to execute a warrant issued by Mr Lang against two of the parties and was struck on the shoulder by a stone.  The two men have since surrendered and will appear today before the Magistrate.  The water whims have not been stopped.

The Police Magistrate arrived yesterday and in all there are 26 armed policemen from Adelaide and other districts.  Everything is quiet at present and, I understand, there is less drunkenness than usual.

Directors Beck, Kingston & Paxton spent a long time last night with Police Commissioner Tolmer and Mr Ayers and, I understand, the bell for work is to be rung at 7 a.m. this morning.

The police are prepared to proceed to any extremity and the miners seem equally determined.

[The voice of the Register then resumes.  The paper says it is clear the heart of the matter is the palpable discrepancies in the assays and the lack of the usual modes used in the UK to come to settlements.  The whole matter having been aggravated by the discourteous line of conduct by the Board of Management as seen in the total disregard of the tributers’ memorial of the 12 August.  The paper then prints an article from the aggrieved miners and another from an independent eye-witness.]
