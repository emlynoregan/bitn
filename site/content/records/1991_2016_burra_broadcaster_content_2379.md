Burra Burrs DC, 30 November

It was resolved to abolish the three committees managing the Burra Tourist Office, Paxton Square and Morphett’s Engine House Museum and replace them with a single committee.  A Tourist Executive Officer will be appointed to be responsible for the overall management of the Council’s tourist properties.  Chairman Graham Kellock said the change was needed for the Council to advance to the next stage in developing and operating the tourist facilities and was not a reflection on the performance or commitment of the committees.
