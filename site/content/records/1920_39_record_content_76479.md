Burra-Adelaide Cycle Race.  There was a good crowd on Saturday to send off the 106 riders on the 110-mile race.  Four locals took part this year: Jungfer, Coleman, Thomson & Garrard.  Thomson and Jungfer completed the distance with Thomson coming in 19th.  A.E. Pearce as Patron of the League of SA Wheelmen asked the Mayor T.H. Woollacott to start the limit men.  The winner was Edgar Emery of Kensington Park.  The roads were bad for cycling and competitors had to contend with punctures and spills.
