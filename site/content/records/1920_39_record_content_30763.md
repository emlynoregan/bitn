Burra Town Council

On 25 May the Council decided to act on The Guns.

Cr Harris gave notice that next meeting he would move to motion previously carried to move the guns to opposite the Institute be rescinded.

The Mayor said this was so old a motion that he deemed it had lapsed and he was prepared to accept a new motion.

Cr Harris then moved that one gun be placed in Lane Garden and the other in Holder Garden.  He said the President and Secretary of the RSL were in favour.  Cr Pearce seconded.  He said most people believed the guns were an eyesore.

Cr Woollacott said it was a delicate matter and a number of influential people were opposed.  He was opposed.

Cr Morgan thought it a disgrace to move them and a slur on the men who fought.

Cr Lee said in most towns with guns they were in parks, which he regarded as a safer position.

Cr Allen supported Cr Lee.  Peterborough had just moved their guns to a park.
