A Bolt.  On Sunday morning Mrs Degenhardt, her daughter Jane and a young girl Alice Byrnes decided on a quiet drive.  All went well from Paxton Square to Abberton Estate where they paused to give the horse a drink.  When the young girls got down to attend to the horse something startled it and it took off.  Alice Byrnes was knocked down and the wheel passed over her shoulder breaking the bone.  Mrs Degenhardt fell to the bottom of the cart when the seat collapsed.  The horse fled through Redruth, took the main road to Kooringa, went through Market Square, across Kingston St Bridge and through Paradise after which it took the stock road until stopped by a deep creek.  Mrs Degenhardt got down in a ‘don’t care’ sort of fashion and said ‘That was a ride if you like!’
