SA Mining Association [Editorial]

The AGM of the association was held Wednesday 17 April [sic: Wednesday was the 16 April].  The retiring Directors were Messrs Jaffrey, Kingston, Beck, Boord and Peacock, who were all re-elected.

Their report is highly encouraging.  Although the sale of copper in the last half-year has been smaller than was anticipated, the yield at the mine continues to be good.  The profits up to the end of the financial year terminating in September last were better than expected.  Despite employing fewer hands, the quantity of ore raised in the past half-year closely approximates that of the preceding six months.  4,835 tons were raised at an estimated 22-23% copper.  There has also been a general reduction in expenditure after the Directors resolved to limit operations to works absolutely necessary and those likely to yield a profit.  The total number of persons employed has fallen from 888 last April to 684.

The ore raised from March to September 1861 was 5,123 tons at a cost of £53,898-3-7 or £10-10-5 per ton.  This realised £63,477-15-8 or £12-7-10 per ton, leaving a profit of £9,579-12-1 or £1-17-5 per ton.  This result as to profit per ton will no doubt be regarded as fully justifying the Directors’ determination to reduce costs.  It will not be known until the next half-yearly report what the cost per ton has been to raise the ore in the last six months, nor can the profit from its sale be known until it has been sold.  Nevertheless the shareholders will doubtless approve of the Directors’ success in reduction costs.  The Directors look to being able to declare a dividend – the first during the present year – in June next.  The funds for this come from £9,579-12-1 profit on copper up to September last, £985-9-5 from rents and £7-5-0 from fees to give a total of £12,070-1-9 available for dividend in June next.

Expectations based on the best advice from England and India are that there will be an extra £12,947-13-2 to add to existing profits, derived from operations to 31 March 1862.  This would bring the undivided profit to £25,017-14-11.  However, since the report was printed the February mail has indicated a fall in the price of copper that has caused the price here to fall from £93-10-0 to £90 per ton.

The Captain’s report indicates that everything at Burra is satisfactory.  At Karkulto 8 tons of copper ore was raised in the past month and 120 tons of iron ore.  There are 11 men working there on tribute.  The Directors have no intention of expanding operations there unless there is a discovery of a good course of copper ore.

This is only a little more than half those employed in 1859.  It seems that much of the savings comes from ceasing to explore for copper in new directions.  When in 1859 the number employed exceeded 1,200 the profit for the two half years was £4-8-3 and £3-7-8 per ton.  Now it is £1-17-5 per ton.

The Directors are anxious to find some way of turning their low grade ores to account.  They are still in correspondence with Mr Henderson on the subject of his patent process for the reduction of low grade ores.  This is a matter which would interest many proprietors of mines across the colony.
