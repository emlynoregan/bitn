Kooringa Methodist Sunday School held its Christmas Party last Saturday.  Games were played till 2.30 p.m. when Gerry Baulderstone, whose birthday was nearest to the day, opened the door for Father Christmas.  Each child had brought a gift for children at the Methodist Children’s Homes and received a gift from Father Christmas’s sack.
