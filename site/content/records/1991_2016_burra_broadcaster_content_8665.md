Burra Traders’ Association

The Association seeks a new role and new members.  A survey has told members that locals want to see a revitalised local economy.  This coincides with the considerable local debate over the Council’s role in the tourism industry.  There is a widespread belief that the Council should be doing more to attract new and essential business to Burra and relaxing some of its rules and regulations arising from heritage legislation.  The Traders’ Association has fewer members than in the past and has decided its role needs re-defining.  This is especially so in view of Council amalgamation prospects, with a possible base elsewhere.

People are especially concerned over the rapid turnover in shops, the absence of some essential services, which leads people to shop elsewhere and the large number of houses for sale.

While there was concern over high rates, there was no widespread disagreement with Council policies on tourism.  Most people surveyed saw Burra’s future closely tied in with tourism and with heritage values.  They were concerned with the perceived lack of communication between Council and the community.  Customer service in Burra was said to have improved and prices were now broadly comparable with Clare.  Most people associated the Traders’ Association with the Christmas celebrations, but with little else – though a need for an association to present traders with a united voice to talk with Council was accepted.

A suggestion was to re-name the Burra Business Association in an attempt to widen its base to represent tourism operators and other businesses.  The survey also suggested it should:

Encourage people to shop locally

Undertake joint promotional activities

Worth with the Main Street Committee to provide a general facelift in the town centre
