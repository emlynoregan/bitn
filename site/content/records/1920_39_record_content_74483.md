The Salvation Army.

On Friday at the invitation of the lady officers Captains Gibbons & Prosser a goodly crowd assembled at the Salvation Army Hall for the opening of the new domestic quarters.  The interior was set for the afternoon tea that was to follow.  The opening was performed by Divisional Commander Lieut. Col. Ede from Adelaide.  The Town Clerk E.J. Davey stood in for the Mayor who was out of town on holidays.  Rev. J.P.H. Tilbrook attended as did the contractor Mr L. Clode and Mrs Clode.  Visitors were welcomed by Captain Prosser and Mr Davey then spoke.  He recalled the early days of the Salvation Army in Burra when they met in the old Anglican Church on Limestone Hill and spoke of the resistance to them, even from within the Council.  Rev. Tilbrook also spoke in support.  Mr Clode handed the key to Lieut. Col. Ede who said he and Envoy Aberg were responsible for the scheme which had cost £308.  They had raised £157-10-0 towards it.  The Col. Then opened the quarters at the rear of the hall.  A side entrance opens into a passage: on the right is a kitchen and new stove.  The passage leads to a dining room with linen press, wardrobe and cupboards on one side.  Off the sitting room on the western side are two bedrooms.  The laundry and bathroom at the rear are equipped with all necessities.  The furnishings at minimal cost have been chosen well.  The afternoon’s takings aided the cause by £10.
