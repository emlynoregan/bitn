Burra Show Soc.

The Ring Committee submitted a program for the dog trials with the usual publican’s booth.

The Soldiers’ Aid Soc. asked to use the publican’s booth as a luncheon facility.

Mr Thomas said that he understood the Soldiers’ Aid Soc. would not run the luncheon if there was a publican’s booth.  [In the next issue of the paper Mr Thomas denies he said this.]

Mr Killicoat said he was a member of the Soldiers’ aid Soc. and had heard no such thing.

It was agreed to go ahead with the building of a luncheon booth for £215, financed by 5% debentures.  The relationship with the Syndicate over this is to be clarified.

The Pastoralists’ Committee recommended a sheep show in September.

A meeting was called for 18 August to decide whether the sale of intoxicants will be allowed at any future exhibition.
