Christmas Messages are printed from:

Rev. David Burgess of the Anglican Church

Pastor Nigel Rosenzweig of Burra Lutheran Church

Fr L.J. Quinn of Burra Catholic Church

Rev. Rod Peppiatt of the Burra Uniting Church Congregation.

Rev. Rod Peppiatt and his family are leaving Burra for Hobart, where Rod will be minister for the North Hobart Uniting Church.  Rod came to Burra from College in 1996 with his young family and has stayed for seven years, making him the longest serving minister in the history of the Burra Uniting Church.  The family has been fully immersed in the community.  Cathryn has managed the pool for a number of years and was previously a supervisor.  She taught in a number of schools and kindergartens in the district as a relief and contract teacher.  She has also been a member of the basketball and netball clubs.  Rod has been chaplain to BCS and for the ETSA Depot before its closure.  He has been an active member of the CFS and in various sporting bodies such as junior football and volleyball.  He has also supported ecumenical activities in Burra.  His last service here will be on 29 December.
