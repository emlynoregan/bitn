Burra Centenary Celebrations Begin

The Centenary Committee has been working hard for months to make the week a success.  The organisation of the celebrations has been much harder than in the pre-war days, when foodstuffs, liquid refreshments and other items were not rationed of in short supply.  Arrangements have been made to secure all such things.  Strings of electric lights and flags were secured with difficulty, but were in place in time to make the town look like Fairyland at night.  The Rotunda and the Welcome sign near the Post Office are particularly pleasing and the Town Council has co-operated by picking out the Town Hall façade in lights.  The celebrations certainly got off to a good start.

The Fancy Dress Procession was the opening event and exceeded the most sanguine hopes of the Committee.  It delighted the many hundreds of spectators who saw its progress from Burra North to the Hospital and thence to Victoria Park.  Mr Dick Smith did a great job as Marshall and had the procession underway only fifteen minutes late, which was a splendid effort.  Mr Jack Allen led the procession as John Bull, as he has done for so many processions previously.  The SA Police Band followed him and then the floats and individual items.  The floats were outstanding, considering the restrictions on crepe paper and such like articles that go into making floats.

Floats included:

Burra Monumental Works

Burra’s Bellowing Belles – 8 young cowgirls on a decorated lorry

Negro Minstrels on a decorated float with piano and string instruments

Burra Post Office staff on a float decorated with many paper roses

Burra Red Cross - float decorated in red, white and blue, with little girls in white

Burra North Red Cross & FFCF – float depicting an old copper mining scene (and Johnny Green)

A German Wagon containing miners’ wives dressed in black

The ‘School Band’ comprising dignified ladies dressed as little boys in a drum & fife band

Lloyd Park’s spring cart with a bridal couple standing in it & the parson on a rail sticking out the back
