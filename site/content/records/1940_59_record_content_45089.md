Aberdeen Croquet Club’s 21st Birthday Celebration

There was perfect weather and a festive air, with gay umbrellas and bright flowers for this occasion.  A match was played between Kooringa and Aberdeen. President, Mrs O. Finch introduced Mrs J.G. Sara to open the celebrations at 2.30 p.m.  Mrs Sara was glad to see so many foundation members present.  She outlined the early difficulties.  The original decision to have earth courts was soon replaced with one to have grass.  The two original courts were not full size, but a gift of land from Mr & Mrs W.H. Gare enabled this to be rectified.  The gift included the splendid hall, which is also used for social purposes and by the [Burra North] Red Cross.  She gave special thanks to their Treasurer Miss L. Bartholomaeus, who had served them since the inception of the club.  Afternoon tea and a series of toasts followed. Miss Bartholomaeus lit the candles on the cake and Mr J.G. Sara extinguished them.  Various games were played in the afternoon and a jumble stall netted over £9 and overall the day added £16-3-0 to the club’s coffers.  Greensman Mr R. Ellis had the greens and gardens in excellent condition.
