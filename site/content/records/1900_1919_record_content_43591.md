Cheer-up Day in Burra.

The task for the day was to look after those who have answered the call.  It was to raise funds for the Cheer-up Hut in Adelaide and to inaugurate a fund to give assistance required by any local soldiers who may return incapacitated.  The Governor and Lady Galway arrived at the station in the state car on Tuesday night.  At 10 a.m. Wednesday they were given a civic reception by the Mayor and Councillors with a guard of cadets.  There followed a procession to Kooringa.

Lieutenant Killicoat and the police were followed by the mounted Cheer-up Girls, the Vice-Regal Party, the Light Horse, Cadets, Citizen Forces, School Children, Burra Band, Boy Scouts, Despatch Riders, Rifle club, Representative Groups and Tableaux, Unattached Riders, Motor Cars and other Vehicles.

The most striking feature was the 42 mounted Cheer-up Girls, uniformly dressed in blue skirts, white blouses, white hats with red bands and coloured handkerchiefs loosely tied around their necks.  The despatch riders were also a great acquisition.  The two motor tableaux – one representing the Allies and the other Russia – were also striking.  ‘Russia’ was a scene in greenery and snowflakes and Mr Schneider, manager for Vivian Lewis Ltd drove dressed in a bearskin.

An arch over the station gates carried the sign ‘Welcome’ in blue on white.  Aberdeen was brilliant with flags and another arch reading ‘Welcome’ in white roses and greenery.  In front of the Institute was another arch reading ‘Welcome’ in blue surrounded by greenery.  Flags and bunting were everywhere.  The procession ended and deposited their Excellencies on a platform in the square surrounded by the Cheer-up Girls, Light Horse and Cadets.  The band played the National anthem and Mr Crewes welcomed the visitors with a patriotic speech which outlined the town and district’s contribution to the war effort: 200 men, 2 chaplains, 4 nurses, 2 doctors.
