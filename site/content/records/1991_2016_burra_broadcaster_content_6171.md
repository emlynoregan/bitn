Burra Picnic Race Club – Thistlebeds Races

The meeting was held in perfect weather.  A number of stalls catered for all needs.  The feature race was the Royal Exchange Cup and was won by ‘Gerard’s Cross’.  The lizard race was much appreciated.  Gymkhana riders also entertained the crowd.  Proceeds will benefit the RFDS.
