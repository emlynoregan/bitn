Burra Hospital Board, 8 September

Dr Steele said he did not wish to enter into a controversy with Dr Ashton who seemed obsessed with the question and would not be happy even if it were settled.  The recent letter in the paper he considered unworthy of Dr Ashton whom he said knew the situation perfectly well.  It may be technically true that the hospital was a public hospital under the Act of 1867, but Dr Ashton knew that for many years before he came to Burra it had been conducted as a subsidised hospital as at present.  Dr Steele took special exception to Dr Ashton’s statement that he would not accept the position offered as it offended the ethics of the BMA which would seem to imply that he (Dr Steele) would be offending those ethics by taking fees from a charitable institution.  This statement was ‘absurd and childish’.  Dr Ashton knew that if it were declared a charitable institution a medical officer would have to be appointed at three or four times the amount now paid and he knew the Burra Hospital could not be carried on in the way the large institutions at Port Augusta and Pt Lincoln were.  Dr Ashton was hinting for his own purposes that he had been discharged for charging patients he had treated at the hospital.  The Chief Secretary recognised the hospital as a subsidised hospital and it was his department that decided the question.  Dr Ashton’s letter was allowed to lie on the table till the next meeting due to the small attendance.

Dr Steele’s letter to Dr Ashton is published in which Dr Steele refers to Dr Ashton’s assertion that he cannot accept a position at the hospital because it would offend his professional ethics.  Dr Steele draws Dr Ashton’s attention to the fact that in November 1920 he had joined Dr Steele in a letter to the Board asking to be appointed to the very position Dr Ashton now says he cannot accept for ethical reasons!  He asks Dr Ashton: ‘Do you mean you were then wrong in seeking that appointment?’
