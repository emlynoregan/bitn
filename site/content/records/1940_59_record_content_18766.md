Burra Clothing Factory

Mr S.H. Walters, who owns numerous clothing factories, proposes to establish one in Burra in the SAFU Building.  He has found the site to be ideal.  It will produce mainly military requirements and some civilian lines.  He expects these factories to continue for some time after the war and will endeavour to make them permanent.  Applications for positions have almost been sufficient.
