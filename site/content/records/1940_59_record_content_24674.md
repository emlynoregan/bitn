Obituary.  Mr W.J. Edwards died recently aged 79.  He was well known in Burra and visited during the centenary celebrations.  He was born 30 March 1867 at Burra and was one of the first boys to enrol at Burra School.  He then served as a men’s mercer with Drew & Co. at Burra and in 1886 was managing their store at Cockburn.  The next year he went to Broken Hill to work for Murton & Buck, leaving for Melbourne the day before the big fire in Argent Street.  He always boasted that he was the first man to ride a bicycle through Argent Street.  He worked at the crystal Palace on the corner of Bourke & Swanson Streets in Melbourne and then for R.T.B. Howie in Hindley Street, Adelaide, before returning to Drew & Co. in Burra for 9½ years.  In 1905 he returned to Broken Hill where he worked for H. Krantz and after twelve months opened his own shop in the Democratic Club Building, subsequently relocating a couple of times.  In the last 15 years the business has been conducted by his son Rorrie [sic: but below a Horrie is listed] who was later joined by his brother Keith.  On 16 December 1889 he married Miss M.T. Murray, daughter of Constable Murray of SA.  He is survived by a widow, six sons and four daughters:

William Roy Edwards of Broken Hill

Mrs Harry Nankivell of Merrylands

Mrs Cliff Peady of Newcastle

Mr Donald Edwards of Stirling West, SA

Mrs Cyril Hylton of Charlton, Victoria

Mrs William Dawes of Northmead, NSW

Mr John Edwards of Coburg West, Victoria

Mr Tom Edwards of Broken Hill

Mr Horrie Edwards of Broken Hill

Mr Keith Edwards of Broken Hill

There are 18 grandchildren and 2 great grandchildren.  In his youth he was keen on running, coursing, rifle and gun shooting and was always interested in racing.  As recently as last October he shot a hare at the Burra Centenary Celebrations.

[William John Edwards, born 30 March 1868 at Kooringa.]
