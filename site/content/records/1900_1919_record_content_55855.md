Violet Day in Burra, Monday 24 June.

This day is the annual effort of the Cheer-up Society to honour the fallen and hearten and cheer those still at the front.  The weather this year was perfect.  Over 100 wreaths and other emblems with the violet predominating were hung around the rotunda.  At 11 o’clock a procession assembled at the railway gates to await the arrival of the train with Brigadier-General Forsyth CMG and Staff for the proceedings.  They were greeted by the Mayor E.W. Crewes and escorted to the car, which was in readiness to take them to Kooringa.  Mr P. Milner acted as marshal.  The escort comprised 20 mounted returned soldiers and one sailor under Sgt Dickson Thompson and Mr James Reed’s car carried those unable to ride.  Following these came the Cheer-up Ladies’ band in white dresses and violet emblems.  Then came the car carrying the Brigadier-General, the Mayor, Capt. Brown & Lieut. Pollard.  Next was a detachment of 30 diminutive Red Cross nurses in snowy frocks and caps, each wearing a violet rosette on their apron.  The Burra High School & State School & their Fife & Drum Band followed and then a lot of children dressed in national costumes of The Allies.  Decorated cars followed.  The most original display was by the Aberdeen Boys Messrs E. Hopcraft (as the Kaiser), R.G. Bernhardt, F. Cox, C. Tiver, A. Fuss & G. Sara.  Their display was a gun carriage driven by A. Fuss & G. Sara.  This was followed by a turnout on which the Kaiser was tied down under guard, having been arrested, according to a notice, while embarking for Hell at Gully’s Wharf.  The Boy Scouts were followed by the cadets under Lieut. Fewster.  Other decorated cars followed.  Most admired was Glenister & Sams’ decorated solely in violets and white ribbon with a large golden cross: ‘In Memory of the Brave’.  L.H. Foote’s car represented a blackfellow’s wurlie with L.H. Foote as the blackfellow with lubra and piccaninnies.  The Curlew Concert Party from Adelaide had a representation of Dick Pascoe’s shaving saloon.

At 1 p.m. the Ladies’ band marched in silence from their hall to the rotunda with a huge wreath of bay leaves and a card bearing the names of 69 fallen men.  Mr Crewes gave a moving address: 606 had gone and many had returned maimed or blind, 69 had made the supreme sacrifice.  He called for donations, half for the local Cheer-up Wounded Soldiers’ Fund and half to go to Cheer-up work in Adelaide.  Afterwards the band played To the Memory of Our Brave.

Brigadier-General Forsyth addressed the crowd.

W.G. Hawkes followed, citing Pericles address to the Athenians from some 500 B.C.

A bunch of violets was auctioned and realised £250.

At 3 p.m. the Boy Scouts gave a creditable display.

The High School girls played a basketball match at 4 p.m.

There were many other attractions including entertainment from a Concert Party of Returned Soldiers.

Frank Harris ran a chocolate wheel where the holder of the lucky number, bought for 6d, won a large box of chocolates.

Mr Luke Day ran the Paddy’s Market most successfully, assisted by a number of helpers.

There were weight guessing competitions and various stalls set up under verandahs around Market Square

They included a sweet stall, fruit, flowers, jumble, souvenirs & buttons, luncheon and afternoon teas.
