Obituary.  Mrs Crewes, widow of Ernest W. Crewes, died at Malvern on 27 June.  She was a daughter of the late Mr & Mrs W. Tickle and was born at Mt Bryan in 1861.  With her husband and young family she went to Broken Hill and Eurowie in the very early days when Mr Crewes was in charge of S. Drew & Co.â€™s operations there.  They returned to Burra in 1892 when Mr Crewes entered into partnership with John Drew and they took over the firm of S. Drew & Co.  She was a quiet worker in the community, unobtrusively helping many of the old and needy.  She was a consistent member of the Kooringa Methodist Church.  She leaves a family of five daughters and one surviving son: Mrs J.L. Sandland (Mannahill), Mrs J. Statton (Mitcham), Mrs J.P. Steele (Hawthorne), Mrs P.A. McBride (Glenunga), Mrs J. Bishop (NSW) & Mr K.R. Crewes (Kooringa).  There are 18 grandchildren & 2 great-grandchildren.  The eldest son Ernest Crewes died some years ago.

[Born Eliza Hornabrook Tickle 27 October 1861 at Mintaro.]
