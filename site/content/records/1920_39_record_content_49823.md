Mongolata Goldfield

Takati Claim.  W. Pexton’s claim has maintained excellent returns and on two occasions in the past has placed Mongolata on the map.  First a handsome pocket of gold in July 1932 and again on 17 January 1933 with a find of 154oz in two pockets.  Last week when everyone was excited over the wonderful find at Baldina-Mongolata the Takati claim produced the biggest nugget yet found on Mongolata.  This is what is known as red oxidised ore and weighed 183oz.  The gold content is estimated at 120-130oz, valued at c. £1,200.  Another nugget of pure gold weighing 12oz accompanied the big find.  The discovery was at a depth of 35ft, the lode of which is 16ft in depth to the present by 3ft wide and has been opened up for 50ft.

The Takati Claim since it has been handled by W. Pexton & Sons has been noted for its consistency in producing payable ore as well as the spectacular finds.  It was not originally intended to exhibit the ore, but before long streams of visitors were arriving at the premises of Edwin Harris, including a number of women.  The lump of ore is fairly rounded and almost black and scintillant of gold from all angles.  Scores of people viewed the nugget in the half hour or so before Mr Pexton took the nugget to Adelaide.  The find failed to interest the city press, which gave it less attention than a 3dwt find at Woodside’s Bird-in-Hand.
