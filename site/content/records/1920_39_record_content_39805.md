Burra Show on 28 October was a great success with a big attendance and excellent exhibits.  Entrance was cut from 2/- to 1/6, so the gate takings were down.  Rising wheat prices imbued a feeling of greater confidence.  The railcar from Adelaide was well patronised.  The Burra Brass Band contributed selections.  Great credit must go to the President Mr I.J. Warnes and Secretary Mr M.S. (Bert) Edwards and their army of workers.

Arts and photography drew few entries.  Black and white etchings by A.L. Bence were highly spoken of.

Poultry entries were up 100 to 300 and of good quality.  The local branch of the National Utility Poultry Breeders Assoc. ensured a high standard of entry.

Cattle entries were unusually large in number.

Cooking entries were numerous and the quality was good.

There was not much competition in dogs, though the standard was good.  Given the interest in coursing surprisingly few greyhounds were entered.

Flowers made a very good display and though not up to the best of years due to a dry spell with frosts, they were nevertheless impressive.

Fresh fruit display was won by produce from L.W. Gebhardtâ€™s garden at Mt Bryan and the only dried fruit display was from G.P. Hicks of Clare.

Grain and fodder were very good this year.

Draught horse entries were up.  H.G. Wardle won Champion for entire.

Horses in action attracted most attention in the afternoon and entries were numerous.  Alf Landorf had a nasty fall, but is recovering.

Needlework entries were of a high standard, but cramped for space and not displayed to best advantage.

Dairy entries were of a high standard.  Eddie Finch was as usual the trophy winner, but he was pleased to find some keen competition this year from A.F. Weckert and A.J. Kelly.  After 20 years of exhibiting Mrs J. Lloyd says this year will be her last.
