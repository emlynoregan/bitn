Burra Town Council, 27 November.

The Mayor mentioned the distress prevalent at present.

Three men were put on in East Ward - one to work in Welsh Place.

Three were put on in West Ward to work in Chapel and Kangaroo Streets.

In North Ward the road along the railway from the goods entrance west was ordered to be done.

Cr Coglin tendered his resignation, but it was not accepted.

A memorial was ordered to be sent to the Government for further details of the Waterworks costs and asking that the old works should be charged at their present value.

Council sat as a Court of Appeals on Friday.

Reductions amounting to £110 were granted.

Town Wits have been suggesting names for the late Council, among others:

The Fighting Council

The Thin-skinned Council

The You Scratch My Back and I’ll Scratch Yours Council
