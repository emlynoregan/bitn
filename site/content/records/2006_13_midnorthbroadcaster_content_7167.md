Helen Szuty writes in response to Jacki Mattey saying she believes Jacki only attended one of the three meetings she wrote about.  Ms Szuty says she believes the meetings were representative and successful in that the matters of concern to Burra ratepayers have been addresses and in the outcome the threats to the Burra Caravan Park, the Burra Swimming Pool and to Paxton Square have been removed.  The resolutions passed at the meeting of ratepayers will be considered by Council as required by the Local Government Act.  RAG believes without its actions there would not have been meetings at Hallett & Robertstown.
