Port Adelaide Smelting Works

The English & Australian Copper Company has begun the erection of its smelting works at Port Adelaide.  The first timber was laid on Wednesday by Mr G.W. Hawkes SM.  The building will initially consist of a single house 276 ft long by 50 ft wide with six smelting furnaces and two refineries for handling copper from the Burra Burra Mine.  It has been ascertained that a considerable savings will be made by bringing the ore to the port instead of taking the fuel to Burra.  It is also intended to then increase the size of the works to handle ore from Wallaroo and from other parts of the colony.  The smelting house will then be doubled in width with two other double houses of equal dimensions to be erected as required.  The structure is a simple galvanised iron roof set upon wooden pillars twelve inches square with iron principals; the side partially enclosed with galvanised iron.  A tramway will bring coal from the wharf and another will be carried above the furnaces to deliver the ore.  It is expected to complete the present stage by 1 September.  The cost is expected to be between £7,000 and £8,000.

30-40 smelters will be employed and the number of coal ships employed by the company is expected to double.  The annual wages bill of more than £5,000 will benefit the community as ‘Cousin Jacks’ spend their money liberally.  During the next twelve months it is expected the expenditure of the company will not fall short of £100,000.  I have been told the expenditure on traffic alone to the company in one year was £60,000.  Mr Hamilton’s sound judgement in building at the port will provide a great saving.  Wallaroo will doubtless send much ore and enable the company to further extend its operations.  After the ceremony at the site there was a luncheon at the company’s offices provided by the host of the Port Hotel.   There were the usual toasts.  Many had asked why the smelter was not at the port.  The company had originally formed its contract with the Burra Company, but for some time the manager, Mr Hamilton, had argued that the difficulties of land transfers and the expense of carriage made it more profitable to locate at the port.  With the discoveries at Wallaroo they would be able to purchase ores from the various companies and sent refined copper home instead of ore.  The iron content of ores from Wallaroo would make it advantageous to smelt them together with ores from the Burra.

[The toasts and accompanying comments are printed.]
