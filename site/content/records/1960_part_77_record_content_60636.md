Farrell Flat Overpass.  Mr Allen MP asked in Parliament why the proposed overpass at the railway crossing just north of Farrell Flat had been abandoned.  Hon. G.T. Virgo replied that the $150,000 cost was not deemed justified.  Only 150 vehicles a day use the crossing, so undue delays are not expected.  A new crossing will be constructed with flashing lights just north of the present crossing.
