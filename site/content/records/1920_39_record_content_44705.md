Rev. J.S.W. Coles & Mrs Coles were given a farewell at the Scout Hall on Monday last.  Rev. Coles has been the Chaplain and acting Scoutmaster.  Assisting Scoutmaster L. Hann was in charge of the ceremony.

At the Parish Hall on Thursday 26 January the congregation farewelled Rev. & Mrs Coles. Other denominations were represented by Captain and Mrs J. Faulds of the Salvation Army.  Mr M.W. Bednall as Senior Warden presided.  He said it was largely due to Rev. Coles that the Church of England Day School had got going.  Mr P.L. Rosman spoke in support and arranged the program.  He also spoke for the Bowls Club.  Dr Steele spoke as Chairman of the Church Day School.  Mr G.H. Dow added his best wishes and Mr Rosman handed over a wallet of notes.

Rev. Coles responded.  He said the 5½ years here had been the most strenuous he had experienced, but he regretted none of it.  He spoke of his pleasure at helping the Wolf Cubs and seeing them grow into Scouts and Rovers.  He spoke also of preparing 80 young people for confirmation and of over 100 baptisms.  There had been few marriages: about one a year.  When he came there was a £600 debt on the Rectory, which had been paid off and another £50 spent on renovations.  Mt Bryan was getting £15 from the Endowment Scheme and Booborowie was getting £50 which amount would eventually reach £150.  He had seen the Booborowie Church build and equip their chancel, which was paid off.  He had received a letter from W.G. Hawkes that he had paid into Black Springs Church funds £100, which under the Endowment Scheme would eventually bring in £300 and he was told another person was giving £50 to Mt Bryan Church.  The Church Choir was now going well.
