Burra North Red Cross held its AGM 7 July.  Officers for 1948-49 are: President, Mrs H.J.B. Jennison; Vice-Patroness, Mrs W.H. Gare; President, Miss M. Rogers; Secretary, Mrs M. Miels; Assistant Secretary, Miss M. Pearce and Treasurer, Mrs S. Scroop.

The Secretary read the 7th annual report.  Meetings had been held on the first Wednesday in each month in the Croquet Club Hall.  This year membership had dropped from 102 to 38.  The aim this year had been to keep as much as possible of the money raised within the town, by donating it to the Hospital, though several deserving Adelaide institutions have also received some small help.  The Drive for the hospital depended largely on four street markets at Burra North.  These were not well patronised, but with donations still raised Â£46.

[Other donations and works are listed.]
