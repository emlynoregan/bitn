Burra Town Council, 3 August

The pine trees ordered by Council were not in stock and it was decided to order instead Canary Is & Maritime pines.

Police are to written to asking them to enforce the speed limit in the town in the face of complaints about speeding motorists.

The Kooringa-Aberdeen Road only now needs rolling for repairs to be completed.

The question of the SAFU corner was raised and there was a move to place a fence from the corner to the pump.  This was headed off with an amendment that the matter lie on the table till next meeting and in the interim the Council will inspect the site.

Cr Riggs moved that Sara & Co. be asked to sell the rectangular piece of land on their corner.  If Council cleared away the old building on it a good view of the road could be obtained.  Carried.
