Winnall said: Yes, only emergency cases, as Nurse Fuss had signalled her intention of leaving and the present staff would have been unable to cope with more patients at that time.

The Chairman (The Premier) considered they ought to be able to get together and talk and let the past go by.  The hospital is struggling and we must consider the interests of the patients.  A little forbearance and a strong desire to get the institution on a firm footing and you should be able to come to an understanding.

Mr Crewes said if the amendment at the public meeting had prevailed it would have covered that ground.  Mr Crewes had suggested at the next meeting that in lieu of Dr Ashton being discharged a letter should be sent to the doctor seeking a conference for the express purpose of putting the past behind them.  Dr Ashton to be reinstated and a guarantee that the rules of the institution should be carried out with respect to nurses and all other matters.

The Chairman said he was happy to give them a fortnight to settle matters themselves before taking further action.  If you cannot settle it ‘you will communicate with me and I will know what steps to take’.

Dr Morris said there were only two points of difference.

The Chairman said it was largely a question of temper:

‘I am not a judge in this case.  I have no power to give a verdict; I can only form my own opinion.’
