Polo.  A polo team from Adelaide visited on Saturday last which was rather rainy.  The report is hard to follow especially given sentences like ‘In the third quarter Burra secured the second and only goal for the day’.

[Both sides had previously been credited with a goal: Adelaide in the first quarter and Burra in the second.]

The final result seems to have been that Adelaide 6 defeated Burra 2.
