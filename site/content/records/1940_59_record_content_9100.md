Obituary.  Mr Michael Roach, an old resident of Burra North, died at his residence last week aged 82.  A brother survives and also a sister, Miss N. Roach.  [Michael Roach died 11 February 1942 Burra North aged 82.  He was single and the birth seems not to be registered in SA.  His sister seems likely to have been Ellen Nora Roach of Burra North, but the lack of birth registrations for either makes this speculative.]
