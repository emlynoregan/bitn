The Great North Road

A meeting of settlers north of Gawler was held at the Gawler Belt Inn, better known as Grotegut’s on Thursday to see the portion of road extending from Gawler to Gilberton restored to the schedule of main roads.

[Gilberton does not appear in Manning’s Place Names of SA, but he does mention a Gilbert Town surveyed about 10 miles south of Saddleworth.]  This stretch of c. 25 miles has been extensively bought up for agriculture and is now enclosed for farming.

[On the present road Riverton is 25 miles north of Gawler and 6 miles south of Saddleworth.]

This restricts the line of transit to a chain in width.  Traffic has increased tenfold and in winter it is impassable in many places, forcing farmers to send produce to market prematurely and only during the time of year when the road is passable.  The Government has made much money through the land sales and pledged to maintain the main line of road.

Motions were passed calling for the Government to honour its commitment and further action is assured, this being only a preliminary meeting.
