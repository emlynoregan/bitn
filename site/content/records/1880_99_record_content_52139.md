Burra Town Council, last meeting of the old Council on Thursday.

Cr Linkson asked if the Mayor could account for the moving of the polling station from Redruth to Aberdeen.

Cr Parks said he didn’t think it right to be dictated to, but Cr Walsh asked for a straightforward answer, though he didn’t get one.

Cr Linkson said it was usual to keep polling stations away from public houses, but here it comes under the same roof – and cost more than the old booth!

Cr Linkson then drew attention to Cr Hardy’s letter to the public press re the Thomas Builder case.  Linkson moved to censure Hardy for going to the press before bringing it up in Council, but Hardy moved to defer the matter to Monday and won the issue on the Mayor’s casting vote.

J.R. Gray then asked that the matter be publicly investigated.  After 20 years service it was very hard to endure such a charge.

Cr Parks after some discussion drew attention to the Record’s naming the Town Clerk as the keystone of the Council.  He felt that the inference that the Overseer was on smoke-oh from 10-11 was libellous.
