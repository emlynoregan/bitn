Booborowie Sports saw a record gate and proved an immense success.  The gate was over Â£21.  Even the old time tug-of-war proved very exciting with the knot in the rope stationary for 1 minute 50 seconds.  The results are printed.  Apart from pedestrian and cycle races there was tilting, pick-a-back race, cotton winding contest, three-legged race, putting the weight and tossing the caber.  A ball followed.
