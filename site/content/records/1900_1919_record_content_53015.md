Fire.  A large fire has been raging for several days out east.  The Mutooroo Pastoral Co. has lost 500-600 square miles of feed, but no loss of stock and the fire is under control as a result of successful firebreaks.

On Quondong J.H. Gallagher has lost c. 100 square miles of bush and grass and miles of fencing.  Loss of stock is unknown.  It is believed to have started from lightning.
