Stony Gap Wind Farm has received the go ahead after the Goyder Council withdrew from its court appeal against the proposal.  The Council’s Development Assessment Panel rejected the proposal last August, but Energy Australia (formerly TRUenergy) appealed against this decision in the Environment, Resources and Development Court.  In the meantime the Council has negotiated an amended application with the company, primarily to ensure that no wind turbine was within two kilometres of an affected dwelling.  Subsequently Council advised the court it did not wish to participate in or be represented at the hearing.
