Political Meeting at Kooringa

[This is a lengthier report on the same meeting that was reported on 11 December.  Perhaps the most interesting additional information is in William Pearce’s speech, where hie says:

‘Sir Henry Ayers had generally been obstructive.  There was a time when he was thoroughly obstructive to the working-classes of that district.  When the township of Redruth was being sold he did his best to outbid each tradesman and workman, so that the allotments were run up to a fearful price.  (A voice – “That’s quite true.”)’]
