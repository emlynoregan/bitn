Burra Hospital Board, Thursday last.

The Board was unable to suggest any plan that would cut costs to the extent demanded by the Government’s reduction of its grant from £1,500 to £1,000.

Mr Hawkes thought the reduction reasonable.  The Government could not be expected to allow over £1,000 p.a. for the care of the indigent.  Since all the staff employed seem indispensable, all they could do was ask for subscriptions and raise the prices for paying patients.  The charge for ward patients at present was 25/- per week, which raised £62 and the cost was c. £100.  Those who could afford it should pay £2 per week.

Mr Crewes thought the Government should have given more notice and if they expected subscriptions to rise then the Board should be elected by the residents of the district.

Mr Warnes said that the district had to subscribe one sixth of the revenue before the public had the right to vote.

The doctors are considering the request for a conference with the Board.

An appeal for subscriptions will be made.

Mr Hawkes said when old age pensioners went into hospital their pensions were stopped, a procedure which benefited the Federal authorities, but not the State.
