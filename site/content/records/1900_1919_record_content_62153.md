Influenza.  Without giving much by way of details the epidemic is mentioned in various places as continuing to affect sporting fixtures, schools etc.  For example Hallett School had been closed when 75% of students had been affected.  Deaths do not seem to have been reported and in Burra it was said to be a milder form of the disease, though widespread.
