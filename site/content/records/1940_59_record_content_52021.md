Jubilee Celebrations got off to a good start on Saturday last.  The town was decorated with flags and stores carried window decorations and displays.  A large crowd assembled for the start of the procession in Commercial St under the direction of Mr R.C. Lott.  Burra Cold Stores had a float representing a Blacks’ Camp and called ‘Burra before Copper.’  The Burra High School float was a large Birthday Cake.  Burra North Junior Red Cross had a hospital ship Manunda.  Mr W.E.D. Young had a band of Gipsies dispensing music.  Mr Johnson Carpenter had a great deal of earth-moving equipment on a truck.  A number of decorated cars followed.  The Mayor led off in his car and the procession marched to the strains of the Ex-Navalmen’s Band.  The procession went via Burra North to the Sports Ground.  The official party comprised Hon. A.G. Cameron, Speaker of the House of Representatives; Mr G.S. Hawker MP and Mrs Hawker; the Mayor, Mr W. Carpenter and Mrs Carpenter.  The Mayor said the Speaker’s presence was particularly apt because Sir Frederick Holder had been the first Speaker fifty years ago.  The Hon. A.G. Cameron then opened the Sports Day and said that like Sir F.W. Holder he had been born at Happy Valley.  A daughter of Sir Frederick’s still held a highly placed position in the Government and so the Parliament’s connection with the family had not been broken.  In 1901 another South Australian, Sir Richard Baker, had been the first President of the Senate and now SA Senator Sir Edward Mattner held the position.  He paid tribute to other local men in Mr Essington Lewis and Hon. P.A. McBride, whom he inferred could be the next PM.
