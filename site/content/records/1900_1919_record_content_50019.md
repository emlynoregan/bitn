Win the War day.  The central Recruiting Committee, without any reference to the local committee, has decided on 11 April and not the 4 May for the day.  This is characteristic of the Central Committee.  The local committee met on Wednesday last and voted to advise the Central Committee that as the State Recruiting Committee had chosen to show the pictures on a day not suitable to the local committee, the whole of the arrangements for the 11 April will be left to the Central Committee.
