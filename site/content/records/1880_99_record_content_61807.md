President R.M. Harvey took the chair.  The year began with £60-19-6 in the bank and ended with £75-8-8.  113 volumes were added to the library, which now houses 2,660 books.  There has been some annoyance by people mutilating or removing portions of papers and magazines and a £5 reward is offered for information leading to a conviction.  The financial position is very satisfactory.
