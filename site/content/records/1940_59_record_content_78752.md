Burra-Adelaide Cycling Classic was held on Saturday over 108 miles.  The winner was Dutch cyclist Joe Divisser from veteran Tom Perry of Renmark.  The fastest time was by Malcolm Hicks of Kadina in 4 hrs 19 mins 29 secs.  Divisser rode from the 16 minute mark as did Perry.  The route was from Burra to Mt Bryan and back before going south to Black Springs and Manoora.  The rough road between Black Springs and Manoora saw about half the field get punctures.  Some riders had several punctures in the race.  The field was comparatively small [though the number is not reported].  The largest ever start is believed to have been 126.
