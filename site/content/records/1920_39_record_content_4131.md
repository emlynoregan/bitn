Accident.  Mr Crewes was knocked down and rendered unconscious by a car at the corner of Chapel and Commercial Streets on Saturday night.  The car swept around the corner on the wrong side of the road.  Mr Crewes was carried to the Commercial Hotel where Dr Ashton attended him.  He was stretchered home.  He is able to get up, but still suffers from bruises and shock.  It is time the speed limit was enforced â€“ cyclists and motorists sweep through the streets at anything from 20 to 35 m.p.h.
