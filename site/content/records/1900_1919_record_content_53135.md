Leighton Strawberry Fete on 1 December was a pronounced success.  This year nett proceeds will aid the Navy & Army Nurses Fund.  Takings were slightly over £200.  The report extends for 1½ columns.

Burra Cheer-up Society Birthday Gift & Button Day.

This was held on 30 November to aid the Cheer-up Hut in Adelaide.

The Rotunda was decorated and stalls were set up.  Energetic button sellers were at work.  Afternoon tea was provided in Henderson’s Buildings.  A special attraction was the sale of an enlarged photo of the Ladies’ Band taken in Government House Grounds.  Mrs I.J. Warnes bought it and handed it back to be sold again.  It was sold again at the public meeting in the Institute re the War Loan and this time Mr I.J. Warnes bought it for £21-0-0 and again returned it.

Mr George Brookman was the highest bidder the next time and he presented it to Mr Bentley to be hung in the Burra Cheer-up Hall as the property of the Band.
