Burra Town Council, 5 October

The Highways Department advised that the Main Road Grant would be £200 this year with the Council to contribute £65.

The Committee of War Organisation of Industry wrote advising that there should be no difficulty in transferring the Institute building to the Council.

The Commonwealth Treasurer on the same subject supplied forms to be completed when the sale was arranged.

It was resolved to shelve ideas of selling blocks of land in West’s Estate and another estate for unpaid rates upon advice that the cost of associated fees and advertising could exceed the value of the properties.

It was resolved that Council hold a special meeting upon receipt of the Minister’s letter giving permission for the purchase of the Institute, in order to consider the matter.
