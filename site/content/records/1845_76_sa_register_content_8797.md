SA Mining Association held its half-yearly meeting at the office in Adelaide yesterday.  The Directors report a gratifying increase in activity. For some time they have been making preparations to resume deep level operations in the hope that sufficient miners would present themselves.  The total number of persons employed at present is 279 including 12 officers.  This is a considerable increase since last March, but remains very low.  We do not doubt that the numbers will increase greatly in the next few months from the returning miners from the partially depleted goldfields of Victoria and from arrangement with the Emigration Commissioners who have relaxed some regulations in favour of copper-miners coming to SA.

Although work in the last six months has been confined to the shallow levels, the ore raised to 30 September amounted to 2,733 tons, containing about 18% copper; equal to 500 tons of metallic copper.

The profit and loss statement for the six months ending 30 September 1853 shows a nett profit of £11,981-4-8.  The quantity of ore raised in that time was 1,781 tons, which sold for £20,519-13-5 or an average £11-10-5 per ton.  The cost of production was £8,538-8-9 or £4-5-11 per ton; leaving a surplus of £6-14-6 per ton.

The quantity of ore on hand at the surface is 2,126 tons and the quantity of metallic copper yet to be realised is 328 tons.  There is a balance of £27,753-11-7 available for dividends.  Some time must elapse before the proceeds of copper and copper ore can be matured, so it is not proposed to pay another dividend before 3 March 1855.  After that time, with the return of labour, there is every expectation that quarterly dividends can be resumed.
