The New Footbridge over the creek near the school has been completed, though some work remains to be done on the approaches to make them safer.  The cost was met by private subscription, but for £5-£6.  The subscriptions will be helped by a concert to be given jointly by the Burra Literary Soc. and the school children next Tuesday 20 July.  [This date is presumably an error as the paper was that of 23 July.]
