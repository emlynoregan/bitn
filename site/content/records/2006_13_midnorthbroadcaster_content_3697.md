Burra’s NP Roadhouse is replacing its old fuel tanks for newer and more environmentally friendly versions.  The new vacuum sealed tank will be bigger and safer with less leakage.  The new tank is coming from WA and it is expected work will be completed within two weeks.  Meanwhile traffic in Thames Street has been restricted.  [2 photos.]
