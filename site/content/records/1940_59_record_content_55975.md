Burra Progress Association will raise funds for the Caravan Park by running a Meanest Person in Burra Competition.  A blackboard outside Mr J. Scott’s shop will list ten names.  To have your name removed will cost a minimum of 2/-, which gives you the right to add someone else’s name to the list who has not previously been there.
