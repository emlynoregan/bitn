Kooringa is growing speedily.  The almost total absence of crime among the nearly 5,000 inhabitants, speaks loudly of their morality.  Even so, it was not wise to have left so much life and property without a single policeman, as happened recently for eight days.  Storekeepers and others are very dissatisfied at the indifference shown by Adelaide authorities to the importance of the place, which is second only to Adelaide.  Authorities need to pay immediate attention to the disgusting state of slaughterhouses and other nuisances.  Unless they are regulated or removed from the town precincts, the hot weather will doubtless bring outbreaks of diseases.  Entire bullocks’ heads, sheep’s heads and offal of various kinds are strewn about in all directions.  Previously roving pigs and dogs devoured this, but now the Company has stepped in and impounded straying pigs and so it is left to putrefy and decay.  Some of the huts in the creek are fearfully overcrowded with as many as twenty people or four families in a single dwelling.  The houses being built by the company are nearing completion, but very many more are needed.  The unwholesomeness of the crowded creek dwellings, without ventilation and on the banks of a creek nearly stagnant and impregnated with copper, must be apparent to everyone.  Despite the overcrowding the mortality remains small, but the coming summer heat may bring it forth to an enormous extent.  The inhabitants endeavour to make the place more wholesome with plenty of whitewash, but it will be a good day when there are no inhabitants in the holes in the banks of the Burra Creek.
