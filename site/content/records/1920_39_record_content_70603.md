Burra Town Council, 20 April

Cr Jeffery brought up the question of residents in the areas just south of the North Ward boundary being really more part of North Ward in their interests that part of the other two wards.

The Clerk said a referendum when A.B. Riggs was Mayor had turned down a proposal to include such areas in North Ward.

Cr McWaters supported Cr Jefferyâ€™s remarks.

The Mayor and Town Clerk will go into the matter.
