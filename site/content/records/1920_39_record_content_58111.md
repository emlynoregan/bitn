Mongolata Sports was held on 9 October.  The morning looked good, but by noon the wind had risen and with it a red haze became more pronounced.  Despite the brickfielder many visitors attended and most of the dust was lying more to the east until a change of wind at about 4 p.m., after which dusty conditions prevailed.  In cycling Leo Taylor of Burra carried off the two and one mile handicap events and Rex [Opperman] won the half mile race.  [Report with results extends for 1Â¼ columns.]
