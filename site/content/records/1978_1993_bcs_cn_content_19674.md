Burra Day Care Relocation

Contrary to rumours circulating the township at present:

Day Care is to be relocated from the Hospital soon to allow for upgrading of internal Hospital service areas and to permit Day Care to function as a true community, non-institutionalised centre.

The Hospital will continue to support the Day Care function and inpatients currently attending Day Care will be encouraged to attend any new venue.

No figure has yet been set as to costing to provide a new facility.

It is proposed that control of the new Day Care will be by a yet to be elected Committee or Board of Management.

If it is seen that more funds are required either for the relocation of the centre or for extras, a fundraising committee will be formed.

John W. Chilton, Secretary of Burra Hospital Day Care.
