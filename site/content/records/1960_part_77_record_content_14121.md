Cricket.  Mokota Association

Burra Footballers 142 defeated Koonaburra 115 & 4 for 86 on first innings.

Hallett 6 for 288 defeated Booborowie 204.

Spalding 113 defeated Mt Bryan 94 & 82 on first innings.

Check for a second inning because it says ‘Spalding failed by only five runs to beat Mt Bryan outright.’
