Mayor’s Report 1929

Despite a generally bad year for the state building operations in Burra continued to the value of c. £9,500 from which fees of £26-15-0 were raised.

The general account started in credit £112-17-8 and finished in credit £146-16-1.

Regrettably nothing has been done towards enclosing the Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial, but such seems to be the wish of the people.

For the Parklands about 60 trees were purchased from Mr Oborn.

The Fire Brigade is doing good work and fortunately calls have been few and the fires small.

The cemetery is well kept.

The Main roads are in good condition and we completed 48 chains from Young St to the Racecourse Gate.  It is now ready for sealing in summer.  40 chains from the Hospital have been metalled and may be ready for sealing by April.

We received the deeds of the Aberdeen Croquet Club in trust.

Public Works

A lot of approved work is on the books.  Major items:

Bituminise the new road near the railway station.

Footpath from National Bank to Post Office.

New road near Burra Children’s Playground to be completed.  [Graham perhaps?]

Road near the Police Station.

Road leading to F.H. Reed’s.

A Civic reception was extended to the Governor on the occasion of his visit to the show.

We note with regret the death of the war-time Mayor the late E.W. Crewes.

Public Works this year come first to the Public Works Committee siting monthly at 7 p.m. and the Chairman of Committee is the Advisory Officer to the Overseer.  This has resulted in more expeditious execution of work and kept the Council in touch with the men.  This has caused some misunderstanding and irritation with a minority of Councillors.  The Finance Committee recommended the allocation of funds according to maintenance needs and this was accepted by Council.

[Accounts then follow.]
