Burra Primary School Welfare Club held its AGM and elected: President, Mrs R. Ellis; Vice-President, Mesdames H. Jennison & N. Woodards; Secretary, Mrs C. Fuller.

Notable purchases for the year were a variety of sports equipment, a wireless and many library books.  It is hoped one of the rooms can be reconditioned for use as a library.  Mrs Towler, the secretary, left the district during the year and her place was taken by Mrs Hayward.  The outbreak of polio during the year threatened the Christmas party, but parties were held with each class confined to its own room and oranges replaced ice creams as another precaution.
