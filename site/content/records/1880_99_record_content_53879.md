Editorial on The Elections.

The National Defence League favoured Basedow, Martin and Rounsevell.  When Wilcox entered the race he split the votes with Rounsevell and both lost out.

The editor found the results generally satisfactory.

May 24 Holiday passed quietly in Burra with only the usual private picnics and a scratch football match.

Election Results.  Final figures showed:

Basedow 2,341 from Martin 2,100 and Russell 1,803.

Burra Literary Soc. on Friday featured prepared speeches.

Burra Show Society committee continues to work towards a September show.

Rev. Thomas Cook, the evangelist, preached three sermons in the Kooringa Wesleyan Church last Sunday to packed congregations.  The crusade continued Monday and Tuesday.

Football.  A spillover of feelings from recent matches resulted in a fight on Saturday night followed by a second, but it all ended with the whole group singing Auld Lang Syne.

Offences.

C. Parks, T. Woollacott & Fred Bourmen were fined 7/6, 6/- & 6/- respectively for allowing their cows to graze in public streets.

Alfred Gerard, driver of Fred. Robinson’s express parcel van was fined 6/- for speeding around the Morehead St Best Place corner.

Three cabbies did the same and George March & J. Drew were each fined 6/- while Charlie Grow was fined 11/-.

Newly Elected MLCs.

M.P.F. Basedow was born in Hanover in 1829 and arrived in SA early in 1848.  He spent two years on a R. Murray Station and in 1856 established a school in Tanunda.  In 1864 he bought the Süd Australische Zeitung in Tanunda which he managed until 1874 when it merged with the Adelaide publication Australische Zeitung of which he is one of the proprietors.  He entered Parliament representing Barossa in 1876 and was Minister of Education in 1880.

James Martin was born in Cornwall and arrived in SA in 1847, aged 26.  He worked as a wheelwright for John Ridley and in 1848 got his own blacksmith and wheelwright’s shop in Gawler.  In time this became Messrs Martin & Co. Ltd. employing hundreds with workshops extending over 8 acres.  The business constructs locomotives etc.  He became an Alderman of Gawler in 1857 and Mayor in 1860 for four years.  In 1865 be became the Member for Barossa, but retired after three years.  In 1885 he was elected to represent the Northeast District in the Legislative Council.

William Russell was born in Glassford, Lanarkshire on 20 October 1842.  His father died when he was young and he went to work on a farm.  In SA he worked for four years as a labourer at Alma Plains before selecting land near Gulnare.  In 1873 he moved to Caltowie where he farmed for 15 years and then at Belton and Belalie.  He has been a member of the Caltowie and Euralia DCs and a member of the SA Farmers’ Association and it Vice-President for two years.  He was a prominent agitator for getting seed wheat to struggling farmers in 1890 and stood for the District of Newcastle four years ago.

St Mary’s Schoolroom Piano Fund benefited from a Toy & Fancy Fair held on Thursday 24 May.  The fair was opened at 3 p.m. and offered a substantial tea at 6 p.m. after which there was a musical evening ‘in which the nigger element was very much in evidence.’  The proceeds were more than enough to complete the purchase of the piano.

Electric Lights have been installed in Murray St in Gawler.

W. Pearce Sen. is gradually improving.
