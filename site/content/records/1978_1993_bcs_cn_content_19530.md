Moxham Family History.  Research by Sharon Greet, BCS Year 12 History.

My interest in family history was sparked in 1987 when Germaine Greer wrote to my grandfather whom she mistook for Mr F.T. Greer, rather than F.T. Greet.

The Moxham name is of Irish origin.  It probably relates to people of the moors or a gypsy type of people who lived on the moors:

Moors Hamlet

Mocs Hamlet

Moxhams

Moxham

Researching the family threw up a lot of Burra’s and SA’s history and has given me an appreciation of time and change and for history.  I intend to continue researching my family history.
