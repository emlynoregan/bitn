The Mayor Mr S. Kellaway said at last nightâ€™s Council meeting that there was a rumour that he had refused to attend a farewell for Mr Mumme.  Such statements were a deliberate lie.  He had not been asked for a donation for the presentation and had not known of it till afterwards.  He considered it his duty to attend any such functions even if it was being given to his worst enemy.
