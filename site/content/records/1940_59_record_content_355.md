Burra Town Council, 15 January.

Swimming Pool business as noted from page 2.

Council protests the high wages of the AWU award.

G. Kuchenmeister asked to lop the pines near his house, which prevented wind reaching his windmill.  Water is not laid on and he relies on the wind for water for his stock, garden etc.

Crs Reed & Samuel pointed out that topping the pines would kill them.  Crs for East Ward will investigate with power to act.

Crs Jeffery & Villis were given 3 months leave as they were to be in camp with the Militia.

Agreement with the Institute Committee to be signed.

Cr Reed moved Coder St be cleaned.  Carried.  [No such place.  Could it be Crowan St?]
