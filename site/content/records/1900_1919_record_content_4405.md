The Young Bicycle Thief who escaped from police at Kooringa last week was recaptured at Pt Adelaide on Thursday.  He apparently walked to Gawler and then took a horse and rode to Adelaide.  He then went on to Pt Adelaide.  M-C Phelan knocked out three horses following him.  He was sentenced to three months at Pt Adelaide for the larceny of a horse and after serving that will face the bicycle charge.
