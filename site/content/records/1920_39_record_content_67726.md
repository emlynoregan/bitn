Matron G. Siegele who has been with the Burra Hospital for 14 years ended her term on Monday and in a fortnight takes up a similar position at Pt Pirie.  She was given a farewell at Mrs E.F. Marstonâ€™s on Tuesday afternoon and from the Golf Club on Thursday and at a cocktail party by Mr & Mrs J.R. Barker at Baldina Station on Saturday.  She was particularly interested in the Maternity Wing and a few years ago went through the Australian Mothercraft Centre course in NSW with flying colours and on return set up the first Mothercraft and Baby Clinic in a SA country hospital.  The large garden in front of the Maternity Ward is the result of her interest and work.  She was a prominent member of both the Kooringa Tennis Club and Burra Golf Club.
