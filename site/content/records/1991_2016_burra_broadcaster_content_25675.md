The Council and Burra

The editor reflects on the Goyder Council’s rating structure with respect to the Town of Burra.

Rates are high – very high.

Burra house owners pay nearly two thirds more rates on their property investment than their rural counterparts and those in other towns in Goyder.

But, the answer comes, they get more services.

If Burra received 60% more services than Eudunda there would be an almighty outcry.

Burra residents also have on average higher valuations on their houses than the other towns in the region and therefore higher rates bills.

Why then do they have the inequality of a 60% premium on the rate in the dollar?

Though Burra Ward generates almost the same amount of rates as the other three wards put together, it has only five of the 13 elected members of Council.

Who of those would personally consider this an issue?
