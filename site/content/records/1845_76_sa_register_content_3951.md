T.H. Williams of the Smelting Works charged John Prosser and David Jones with refusing to work.  He produced agreements for them to work at the smelters for seven years.

Prosser had refused to work because he had not been provided with a particular house.

Jones refused because his son, aged about 16, was not receiving adult wages.

Defendants (through an interpreter, because they were Welsh) said Mr Williams had broken many promises to them.

The Magistrate said that if they had complaints against Mr Williams, he would be quite willing to hear them, but the agreement stood and they had broken it.  On their agreeing to return to work, His Worship ordered their wages be abated 30/- and they pay costs.
