Burra Burra DC, 5 January

Council endorsed the appeal for scrap aluminium for the war effort.

Council resigned from the Burra Progress Association.

[The reason is not clearly given, but Council appears to have taken offence at the Association’s report on a deputation they had taken to Council – a report the Association had also sent to the Record.]
