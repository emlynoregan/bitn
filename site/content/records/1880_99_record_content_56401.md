Cr Sampson said the same question had cropped up when Mr Holder was Mayor and the Central Board had given instructions.

Cr Hardy asked if anyone else had complained.

The Inspector said some years ago 6 or 7 had signed a requisition and there had been complaints since.  He had served a notice on 14 March.

Cr Rabbich felt he had been singled out as other boiling down establishments were just as bad.

The Mayor said that was not the question: they had to deal with the letter received.

Cr Harris said the smell came also from Austin’s

Cr Rabbich said he would restrict boiling down to winter and further fit a tight cover with a flue into the chimney.

The mayor said that would not do.

Cr Sampson moved that boiling down be not allowed within the Corporation limits.  Cr Parks 2nd.

[The next issue gives the voting as Sampson, Parks, Harris & West for with Rabbich and Hardy against.]
