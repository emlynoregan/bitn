Vandalism.  Vandals have ripped the covers off the lights at the base of the War Memorial and filled the reflectors with gravel.  They have damaged a number of corner posts, stolen lights from the conveniences, hacked at trees and made a filthy mess in the shelter shed between Burra and Burra North.
