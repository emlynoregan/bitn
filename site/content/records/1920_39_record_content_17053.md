Burra Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial Fund.  A meeting was called on 6 October to decide who was responsible for finalising the memorial scheme.  Mr Crewes said that all along it had been intended to erect an Honour Roll as well as the fine memorial.  There was money left over for the roll from the memorial fund.  The meeting was to decide whether the existing chairman and committee should carry on or whether the Mayor of the day should head the committee.  There was £40 still owing in promises and £75-2-6 in the bank.  It was decided that the chairman should be the Mayor.  The resignation of Mr Dane as Secretary was accepted with regret and Mr G.H. Dow was elected in his place.
