UNDATED EXTRA – probably also 1 Dec. 1897

A slip about A5 size.

Mr Drew’s coach-house burnt down on Tuesday afternoon. [30 November]

The fire at 5.15 p.m. utterly destroyed the building.  Fortunately the trap was out at the time, but his valuable collie was burnt to death.  Usually the key to the coach-house was left with his young son, but being in a hurry that morning he forgot to do so.  The residence on Mt Pleasant meant that the flames could be seen from all over Kooringa.  100 willing helpers were soon on the scene and devoted themselves to saving the adjoining buildings which in spite of the effort caught fire, though this was eventually extinguished.  The coach-house was a timber structure.  The cause is not known, but it is thought probable that the maid put some ashes into a box close to the shed which then caught fire.
