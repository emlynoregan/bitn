Burra Town Council, 2 November

Mr Woollacott was given permission to build a house for Mr P. Oates in Redruth.

It was resolved to tar the road to the Mine Bridge.

There was considerable debate over the maintenance of roads generally.

The matter of the Hospital Board was raised.

Cr Riggs was their representative on the Board and he expressed a wish to see the Board reduced in size and to be free to vote as he saw fit.  Others took the view that the constitution should not be changed without public consultation or that their representative should be instructed to vote for the status quo.

Cr Hammond and Cr Kellock favoured giving Cr Riggs a free hand.  This view ultimately prevailed three to two with Cr Riggs not voting.

‘Back to Burra’.  An article by Dr Torr in The Australian Christian Commonwealth.

This was a generally interesting article, but not I think with any details that add much to what has already been noted.  There are two photographs from ‘Back to School’.

There were also letters thanking organisers etc. from A.S. Rawlings & E. Bennett.

Mr Abraham Samuel Gordon of St Kilda, the author of Mordecai MacCobber, the story of a Scotch Jew in Australia, paid a visit to Burra this week.
