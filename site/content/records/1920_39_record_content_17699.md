‘Back to Burra’ was the most notable happening of the year.  It ran from 24-30 October.  Some hundreds of former residents paid visits and the town was beautifully decorated by day and night with welcome arches at the railway gate, the Institute and Lewis’s Bridge.  The week was filled with outings, concerts, dances, the show, sports and a ‘Back to School’ morning.  It was a great success and all who took part are to be congratulated.  The Burra Show was better than ever and the new grounds and appointments are a great asset.
