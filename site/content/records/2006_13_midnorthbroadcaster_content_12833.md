The Burra Burra Branch of the National Trust has named the shed at the Bon Accord Museum ‘The Les Warnes Fire Engine Shed’.  Les Warnes was the special guest at the unveiling of the new name.  Les has personally maintained the three National Trust fire engines for many years.  Chairman Paul Marsson performed the unveiling with Barry Wright officiating at the presentation.  Mr Warnes and his wife Nan were among the first members of the branch when it was formed in 1965. [Photo of Les at the shed.]
