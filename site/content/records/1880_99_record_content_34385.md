Editorial on Dairy Farms, suggesting that more could be established and in favour of dairying factories because then butter and cheese would be of more uniform quality.  Locally we have a market at Broken Hill, which is likely to be permanent.  Poultry and bacon could be a useful adjunct and a useful way of escaping from the old wheat farming style.
