Ernest Wells and William Cahill, young men, were charged with defrauding SAR by travelling without a ticket in the lavatory of a 2nd class carriage at Mt Bryan on 24 March.  Wells admitted getting on at Terowie.  They were fined Â£5 or 14 days.  The bench regretted that they would have to serve the time in Adelaide Gaol as that gave them a cheap trip to their desired destination.
