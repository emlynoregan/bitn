Joan Hanlin of Clare writes wondering if there is anyone who was born in Burra earlier than her mother who was 96 in July.  Her father was Captain Roach.  [Elizabeth Tuck, the wife of Alfred Robert Tuck, was born 18 July 1865 at Burra Mine to James and Mary Roach (nee Dunstan) and she died 9 September 1962 at North Adelaide.]
