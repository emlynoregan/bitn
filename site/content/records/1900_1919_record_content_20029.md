Football.  On Wednesday the Ramblers played Aberdeen, but both sides struggled to field a team.  Aberdeen began with only eight men in uniform and co-opted youngsters, though W. Allen and F. Carless arrived later.  Ramblers were in a similar fix and eventually a poor game resulted in Ramblers 5.6 (36) defeating Aberdeen 1.6 (12).  [W. Allen probably Walter.]
