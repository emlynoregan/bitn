Local History Book Burra: a Photographic Journey Launched

The Professor of Australian Studies at Deakin University, David Walker, was the guest speaker at the Burra History Group’s launch of its new book Burra: a Photographic Journey at the Burra Town Hall on Monday afternoon.  President Meredith Satchell welcomed the crowd of about 45 people [actually closer to 70] and introduced Professor Walker.  Professor Walker has strong family connections with the town dating back to the 1870s.  He warmly praised the compilers of the book, Meredith Satchell and Eric Fuss, for their wonderful historic record.  Mayor Peter Mattey was also on the stage and was asked to cut the ribbon to officially open the newly restored Civic Room at the Town Hall with its display of the photographs of past mayors.  Guests were treated to wine and finger food while wandering from room to room taking in the many displays on Burra’s history.  [Photos.]
