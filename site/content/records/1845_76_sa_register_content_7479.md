Obituary/Inquest

An inquest was held on Wednesday 5 November at the Smelters’ Home Hotel on the body of a miner, Arthur Poole, who had been buried alive by a sudden fall of earth on 3 November while at work in the Burra Burra Mine at the 20 fathom level.  The jury went to see the body at the Mine Hospital, which was nearby.

William Wren, a lad who worked with the deceased, was sworn.  The ground in a certain part of the level had sunk about four feet and in order to get their ore to the surface it was necessary to fill in this gap and make it sound, so they could wheel over the spot.  The deceased was placing rubbish into this gap.  The sides and roof of the level were supported by substantial timbers with the vertical logs kept in position by large slabs called spreaders.  Over the gap was such a spreader.  The sinking of the ground had removed earth from under this spreader, which was thus unsupported and unable to bear any weight.  The deceased had been wheeling over a plank placed there without interfering with the spreader, but at about 11.30 a.m. the plank needed to be moved and the deceased trod on the spreader to save him from getting into the depression to shift the plank.  The spreader sank, the perpendiculars moved together and the roof collapsed, covering the young man.  Captain Roach and others responded rapidly, but it was 4.30 p.m. before the body was recovered.  He was then quite dead.  The witness said that the deceased had no business to tread on the spreader and he considered the place where the accident occurred to be properly and securely timbered.

John Thomas gave corroborative evidence and agreed with the assessment about the adequacy of the timbering.

The jury returned a verdict of Accidental Death.  The coroner, George bull, then fined Mr William Hill 10/- for failure to attend as a juror when summoned.
