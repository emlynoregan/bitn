Pearce’s Building

Following the recent claim by a visitor that the last direct descendant of the Pearce Family associated with Pearce’s Buildings had died; we have had correspondence from a number of descendants to contradict the claim.  Miss Mary Pearce wrote to us and then Tom Dearlove wrote as one of six remaining grandchildren.  He included some information about the building:

[*It was built in 1914 and ready to let in 1915:

Burra Record XXI, 1886, 25 Mar. 1914, page 2.  Intention to build.

Burra Record XXI, 1888, 8 Apr. 1914, page 2.  Work has started.

Burra Record XXII, 1927, 13 Jan. 1915, page 2

Pearce’s Buildings are now practically finished.  There are two suites of offices on the ground floor, occupied by Mr Winnall and Mr Jeanes, the Federal Division Returning Officer.  At the rear is a small hall 33’ x 26’ to be let for meetings, parties etc.  Two suites of offices upstairs are yet to be let.  The building is most imposing.
