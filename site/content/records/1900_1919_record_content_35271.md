Burra Institute Committee, Monday.

Mr Lester of the Theatregraph Co. wrote complaining of being kicked out of the hall on Friday nights after hiring the hall for every Friday.  Mr Wilkinson said it was about three times a year and he understood special arrangements were made.  Letters from Kapunda and Petersburg asserted that the Theatregraph Co. was never disturbed there.  Mr Lane said there had been five such occasions this year.  Mr Lane is to see Mr Lester.

E.J. Davey, Secretary of West Burra Copper Co. asked to be allowed to use the Institute as the registered office of the Company.  Agreed for £10 p.a.

Mr Fuss submitted plans for the proposed new members’ room to be built on the west side in the angle of the present room: 25’ x 17’9” and 12’ high with two windows on the west side.  Estimated cost is £150-£160.  It was decided to call tenders.

Mr Lane was concerned that the new room would block another window in the hall with one already blocked by the lodge room.  Another fire escape should be provided, more especially for the purpose of ventilation.  Mr Fuss said a tremendous amount of excavating would have to be done in that case.

It was referred to the Hall Committee.
