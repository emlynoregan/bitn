Family Fun Day at Redbanks attracted about 120 people on Sunday.  The event aimed to increase the natural and cultural history awareness of locals. [Photo]

The event was hosted by Natural Resources Northern & Yorke.  The event included Aboriginal cultural tours, fossil displays and a palaeontologist representation.  Redbanks differs from many other megafauna sites as the fossils are often found as whole specimens and it contains the naturally visible geological profiles up to 30 metres deep, exposed through the incision of watercourses.
