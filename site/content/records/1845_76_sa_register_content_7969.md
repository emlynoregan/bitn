The South Australian Gazette and Mining Journal has ceased publication.

[The reason for the closure of the journal was the withdrawal of many of the staff to the Victorian diggings, which had firstly forced a reduction in size, but now made it impossible to continue, as the remaining workers were about to follow the example of their friends.]
