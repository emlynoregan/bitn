Mayor’s Report 1914

This year has been very dry and the harvest one of the worst known.  Some farmers will not even reap seed wheat for next year.  Hay and grass is very scarce and agistment has been sought where possible.  This has impacted on town business as well.

War, of course, has been the other great event of the year.  This immediately led to a grand patriotic meeting and the formation of the Patriotic Fund with its working committees.  So Far £259-13-10 has been raised.  Money raised locally for the war effort from all sources and for all causes is c. £800.  The Red Cross Branch has raised £67-1-8.  A committee to raise money and other aid for the Belgian Relief Fund has also bee established.

23 Burra Boys have already sailed with the 1st Contingent for service in Europe.

Unemployment.

War and drought combined have led to local unemployment.  To counter this the Council has applied for a special grant of £200 to be repaid over several years.  This plus the usual subsidy of £430 will be applied to main roadwork.  We anticipate a favourable reply.  We have also asked for more work for local men on relaying the railway and at the quarries and to immediately proceed with the new town reservoir.  (Since writing the above 30 married and single men have been put on the railway re-lay gang.)

Electric Lighting

This has been much discussed and information from other centres gathered.  In several places the schemes are too recent to allow useful evaluation.  Under prevailing conditions of drought, tight money market and war, it was decided not to proceed and the scheme proposed by the previous Council was turned down.

Fire Brigade

In the light of recent fires the Council is looking into provision of a fire brigade.

Burra Coronation Band

This is still very active and has rendered valuable service in the year under the leadership now of Mr James Bentley following Fred Wheatley who left with the 1st Contingent.

The Seaside Trip was a great success and we hope a similar excursion will be held in 1915.

Trains

The Council has managed to get the restoration of the cancelled services on Saturday night and Monday morning.
