Business Takeover

The Modern Meat Store of Fred & Jan McLean has taken over the butchering business of Messrs Harold and Jack Topsfield, effective midday Saturday.  The Topsfields have been in business 26½ years.  The new proprietors will continue to operate Topsfield’s shop in Burra North, but in Burra only McLean’s shop will remain open.
