Public meeting at Kooringa

The tone of this meeting to discuss a range of political matters was decidedly liberal.  W. Lang chaired the meeting.

There was a proposal to extend the franchise to all holders of tenements of the annual value of Â£5, but what was carried by a large majority was a declaration in favour of universal suffrage.

The system of voting by ballot was strongly opposed by the chairman, but carried by a large majority.
