Knocking Down Cheques at Burra

In our recent article on this subject it now appears we misunderstood our informant insofar as stating that the changed conditions there were due to Police Constable Wilson.

James Sullivan writes in response to a letter signed ‘W.H. Geddes’, Burra Hotel, which appeared in the Observer of 16 October.  Sullivan begs to contradict Geddes statements regarding the young man Ryan from Ketchowla, with the broken leg.

As one of the party that came from Ketchowla, I can say that the barman, as I supposed him to be, bluntly refused to take the man in, although we offered to pay any charge he might make until Monday morning, when the patient was to go to Adelaide Hospital by train.  I must say that Mr Austin did all he could considering the distance in the bush, that any kind feeling gentleman could do for a poor unfortunate bushman.
