Manhunt ‘Out East’

Wilbur Frank Cook, alias A. Williams etc. eluded capture for days by police and Jimmy James, Black-tracker.  He was finally captured at Quondong 120 miles from Burra.

Cook is 45 years old 6’1” tall and on 5 June he stole a Ford V-8 coupe of Mrs A. Birbeck of Norwood and headed off with Alice Emma Dittmer, a domestic servant.  He apparently headed across country to try to reach the NSW border.  Petrol was the main problem and he bought, begged and stole it en route, but never got enough for one long run.  The car was eventually abandoned, bogged in a rabbit burrow on I.J. Warnes’ Sturt Vale in a deplorable state.  The woman was found nearby and taken to Redruth Police Station, charged with larceny and sent to Adelaide.  Cook walked on, carrying a kangaroo-skin rug and by keeping to hard ground made it hard for the Black-tracker to follow him.

The first inkling of trouble out east was in the middle of the week ending 10 June when it was clear someone was playing havoc with telephone wires and fences.  It was not then known that the car of this man and his female companion had been stolen, nor for certain that he was the person cutting phone lines and fences.  Apparently he arrived at Ketchowla on Tuesday 6 June and bought petrol.  He then went on to Bendigo, Loch Winnoch & Braemar, reaching the latter on 8 June.  Mrs Lindley the housekeeper rang Kooringa Police to say a man and a woman in a blue car had demanded petrol.  She refused to give petrol and they left on the Mulga Hill Road.  She had to wait over 1½ hours before phoning for Mr A.B. Ridings, the manager, to return and repair the telephone line.

Other police were notified and it was thought the pair was headed for Broken Hill.  On Saturday 10 June George Kellock reported a couple asking for bread at Woolamba and that he had later found goods to the value of over £10 missing.  Mr Kellock identified Cook from a photo.  This was the first sign they had doubled back.  At 2 p.m. Saturday information suggested the car would reach Burra at any time.  Two hours later it was learned they were near Braemar.  Braemar was phoned and asked to stop them, but soon after Braemar rang to say they had gone through Faraway Hill and were believed headed for Lilydale.  Police from Mannahill, Yunta, Cockburn, Burra & Hallett converged on Sturt Vale and found tracks of the car.  Though the tracks zigzagged and showed the car bogged twice, (he’d taken a tremendous drop over the weir at the top end of Sturt Vale and managed somehow to straddle the pipeline) it was still not seen.

On Monday 12 June a station hand found the woman walking and took her towards Faraway Hill and police found her in his charge.  She said she had grown sick of Cook and left him on 11 June.  She said Cook was headed towards Bendigo Station to steal Tom Penn’s new Morris 8/40.  On Tuesday 12 June the car was found bogged in a rabbit hole at Salt Bush Dam on Sturt Vale.

With Cook on foot in dense scrub the police sent for Jimmy James and they arrived with him at Sturt Vale at 6.30 a.m. 13 June.  With 1½-day-old tracks it was hard to follow Cook.  James tracked him six miles the first day and on Thursday at 2 p.m. Mrs Olive Earle of Quondong sent a phone message relayed by Mrs O’Brien of Sturt Vale that Cook was coming through Quondong Homestead gate.  Police rushed to Quondong – the only station in the area they had not had a policeman at.  When Cook arrived he talked with the sixteen shearers, had a wash, a good feed and a smoke and told the residents all about himself and his exploits.  When police arrived he disappeared into the scrub and James’s services were called for.  He was found in a washed-out gutter.  He was brought to Burra and formally charged on Friday afternoon and remanded to Adelaide to face further charges.
