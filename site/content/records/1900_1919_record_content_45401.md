Burra Show Soc. met on Friday.  Last year it was decided the profit would go to the Wounded Soldiers’ Fund.  The Secretary read the report.  They started 1915 in credit £47-1-5 and ended in credit £164-17-4.  The profit was £117-15-11.  This included £39 of returned prize money and the sale of a ram presented by Messrs H. Collins & Co. for £63.  It was resolved that the Secretary’s salary of £50 for 1914 & 1915 be a charge on the money in hand prior to the show.  It was resolved to donate £130 to such patriotic funds as might be decided, leaving c. £12 to meet any outstanding liabilities.  There was then debate about what the 1915 resolution had meant – did it mean only The SA Wounded Soldiers’ Fund?  Some thought the idea was that and others that it was more generally for wounded soldiers.  Eventually Mr Winnall gave notice he would move that the motion giving all profits be rescinded and if that were carried, would then move that £130 be paid to such war funds as the committee deemed advisable.
