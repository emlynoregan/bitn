Edward McClure a.k.a. Walter Edwards

About a month ago a man was admitted to Burra Hospital suffering a wound to the back of his head and a puncture wound in the neck.  He claimed to have been hit by a car near the Royal Exchange Hotel.  He had been noticed bleeding profusely near the hotel and Mr Murison drove him to the hospital after he had been assessed by Dr Steele.  Police enquiries revealed no car had passed at the time.  On 3 March, some days after leaving hospital he was arrested for having no means of support and for stealing a hospital blanket.  He was sentenced to three months and six months on the charges, to be served concurrently.  His swag held a series of photos of himself in various hospitals bandaged about the head.  On investigation he had scars galore on his head.  While being taken to Adelaide he was recognised at Riverton as having been admitted to hospital there posing as unconscious with two black eyes
