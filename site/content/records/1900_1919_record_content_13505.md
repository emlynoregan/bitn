‘The Gums’ correspondent writes about the opening of the new Bundey German Church.  It was built of stone, brick pointed and with an iron roof.  It cost £90 and replaced an old church destroyed in a storm some months before.  The congregation was c. 150 and except for a brief sermon in English as a concession for English speaking visitors, the services were entirely in German.
