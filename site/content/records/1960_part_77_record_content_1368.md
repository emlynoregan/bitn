Obituary.  V.T.L. Hughes of Mt Bryan East died suddenly on 8 March aged 69, while attending to stock.

Mrs Colin Hughes and her little girl were the only ones at home at the time.  Mr Hughes came to Mt Bryan East about 1907 to work for Messrs Thomas & Gare at Glen View and after a number of years he purchased a small holding and went share farming.  Owing to low wheat prices he sold his farming plant and took casual work as his holding was far too small to make a living on.  He has erected many miles of fencing in the district and up to a few weeks of his death was still engaged in that laborious work.  He was a loyal member of the Mt Bryan East Methodist Church and was a regular worshipper until the church closed a few years ago.  He was a life member of the Mt Bryan East Agricultural Bureau.  He was buried at Hallett Cemetery.  Mrs Hughes predeceased her husband in July 1950.  Six children survive: May Mrs Williams of Wallaroo, Aileen Mrs Modra of Gawler District, Albert of Adelaide, Jean Mrs Don Kessel of Kadina and Colin and Levi both of Mt Bryan East.

[Victor Thomas Levi Hughes born 1 June 1890 at Wonna: died 8 March 1960 Mt Bryan East.]
