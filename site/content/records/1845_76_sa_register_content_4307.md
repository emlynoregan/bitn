Resident Magistrate’s Court, Kooringa, Monday 11 February.

John Taylor charged Daniel O’Leary with possession of a pair of bullock winkers.  He said he lost them about two months earlier and on seeing them with O’Leary the latter had refused to return them.  O’Leary said he had been given them by Mr Burslem, who said he had found them.  He was prepared to hand them over if His Worship thought they belonged to Taylor.  His Worship advised handing them over.

Wednesday 11 February [sic: for 13 February].

Thomas Gallagher and Joseph Thornton had been charged by William Windover of entering his house through a window and threatening to murder him.  Windover failed to appear and the two were discharged.
