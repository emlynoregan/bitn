Editorial on agitation for a seed wheat program by the Government.  He restates his views that areas of the north and northeast should revert to pasture and the state should not give seed wheat away and should only make loans on security.  The most the Government should do he thinks is to make advances to District Councils on the security of their rates to an amount not over 6d in the Â£ to be repaid in four equal instalments at the end of each of the next four years.  The Treasury would lose the interest and this is the most we could approve of.
