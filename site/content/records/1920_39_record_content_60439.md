Redruth Methodist Church held its harvest thanksgiving services on 8 March.  Rev. D.C. Harris of Riverton conducted three services.

Hallett Annual Tennis Tournament is reported in almost 1¼ columns.

Burra Reunion Committee had an address by Mr Victor H. Ryan at Moore’s last Friday.  He spoke of being born and partly educated in Burra and had memories of Sir Frederick and Lady Holder, the Drew families, Hon. John Lewis and Phil. Lane.  He gave an account of Burra’s past and agreed it should play a significant part in the state’s centenary celebrations.  On a visit to Burra he had been shown around by the Mayor and been taken to the dugouts.  He said the Government and the Centenary Executive Committee are encouraging country towns to participate in the celebrations and he was sure that the Back to Burra celebrations in October would receive the support of the Government and the Centenary Executive Committee.  [The rest of the article outlines other events in SA for the Centenary Year.]
