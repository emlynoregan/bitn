[Performers etc. are listed.]

In June 1978 the school newsletter took on a more community role and was more widely distributed, being made available from stores in Burra, Booborowie, Mt Bryan and Hallett.  Publication became weekly during school terms.  The School Council purchased an offset press for $6,000.

Over the next sixteen years the size and colour of the newsletter changed, but its basic concept remained the same.  It carried news from the school, the community and the Council.  It advertised fund-raising events and had a diary of events and church notices.  There was plenty of sport, a chat column and library news as well as photos.  In short it became a comprehensive newspaper.

Soon Cynthia Burnett needed volunteer typists and Jan Jacka and Di Cameron were the first to offer.  Denise McCabe took up the challenge of layout.  Sue Gebhardt became Chief Editor.  Gradually the numbers involved in all aspects of publication increased.  [A long list of those involved is printed.]

Chronological Highlights:

1978 – The newsletter began.  Burra Apex Club bought equipment such as electric typewriters etc. and continued its support until it disbanded in 1990, when it gave a final donation of $1,300.

1987 – The school printery closed and the newsletter was commercially printed.  In this year a grant of $1,000 from the State Bank helped with equipment.

1991 – David Maher redesigned the logo on the front page.  The newsletter survived on donations and sponsorship – especially from Apex, Burra Traders’ Association and the Council.  It was distributed to each school family and to stores in Burra, Booborowie and Mt Bryan, to Farrell Flat Hotel and for a time at Hallett.  It was also posted to readers interstate, in Adelaide and in other country areas.

[The current production team was then listed.]

It has sometimes been of more than 20 pages and is much to the credit of the community that it survived for 16 years.

Now that Burra again has its own newspaper the ‘Burra Broadcaster’, rather than duplicate news and the effort, the Community Newsletter has finished its job and has made way for the commercial enterprise to succeed.
