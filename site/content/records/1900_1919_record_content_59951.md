Cr Radford thought the meeting could not instruct the delegates how to vote.

Mr Ruthven said there was no use appointing them if the meeting couldn’t instruct them.

In response to a question the Mayor said the monument was expected to cost c. £1,500.

The Mayor & Mr Winnall were elected delegates.

Mr Thompson moved the meeting adjourn to a date fixed to ensure a full public meeting.

Mr Winnall said if Mr Thompson’s motion was lost the question would be settled in favour of a monument as that is the position of the Mayor and himself.

The resolution was put and lost.
