Burra Town Council, 19 March

Rent on the Council Chamber increased by £5 to £25 p.a.

The Fire Brigade Board notified the Council that its share of upkeep for three months was £18-13-4.

This was a lot in excess of the estimated £42 p.a. and the Council will express dissatisfaction and query the inclusion of £40 for new uniforms when new uniforms were supplied last year.  The Fire Brigade thought the tank at the station should be 1,000 gallons, not 400 gallons.

There was considerable discussion of impure water entering gutters from premises.  Some of the problem was also due to rubbish and some due to insufficient fall in the gutter.  Inspections will be carried out.  The existing overseer was appointed to the advertised position at 14/6 per day.

H. Wilson was appointed curator and lamplighter at 13/3 per day.

Work on c. 15 chains of Morehead St was approved.

Local Board of Health

J. Herbert was re-appointed as scavenger.
