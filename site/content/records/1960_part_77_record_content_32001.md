Burra Pictures

The Secretary of the Burra Pictures Committee Mr A.R. Graham reports on a severe decline in attendance.  The operation has been making a loss for the past twelve months except for a few nights.  The cost of running is c. $40 a show, but on some nights receipts have been as low as $16 and on a number of nights in the range $20-$25.  In eleven weeks since 5 September the average attendance has been 64, including children, with a low of 31 and a high of 109.  The secretary seeks any suggestions, as he would like to see the pictures continue, but this cannot be done with continued losses.
