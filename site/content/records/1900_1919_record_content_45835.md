Ambulance Day in Burra.

The committee has received an offer from Mr Lester of Theatregraph Pictures to give ‘all above usual proceeds’ to the fund.  The Mayor has been authorised to buy an Overland or an Oakland subject to Military approval, so it might be in Burra for the day.  Someone had suggested that Mr Crewes would get a handsome commission on the purchase – well he hoped he would – as large as possible, and the fund would get every penny of it.  The Trench Digging Committee had reluctantly concluded the idea was impracticable.  There were not enough young men in the town now to carry out the work and if let to tender it would cost £30-£40.

The procession would start at 11.45 from Aberdeen.

A Punch and Judy show was to be obtained if possible.

A concert and an auction will be organised.

Mr A. Walker is organising a sideshow where for 6d everyone will get a prize.

[Apparently this was a sort of lucky dip, but some of the prizes were significant, including a sheep, a fat lamb, a piano, a bag of chaff, watches, clocks and cases of fruit.]
