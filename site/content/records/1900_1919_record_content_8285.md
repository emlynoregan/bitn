Maria Fairchild writes denying that she was ‘Common-sense’ in the correspondence re Rev. Murphy and denying his assertion that she could not write.  She was present, but had no intention of writing to a paper about it, but now says she was well pleased with the way Miss Niemann conducted herself on the occasion and agreed with the sentiments expressed by ‘Common-sense’.
