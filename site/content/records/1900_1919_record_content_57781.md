Navy Day

This was observed in very bad weather on Friday 1 November.  The Square had been decorated and stalls erected, but the latter were moved to the Institute and the decorations taken down to save them from damage.  The Naval Band arrived at 11.30 under Lieut. Argent.  The procession was led by the Ladies’ band and the Naval Band and the School Band took part.  After speeches the model of HMAS Australia was auctioned under the Bugler system and raised £435.  Despite the difficulties imposed by the weather the day raised £650.
