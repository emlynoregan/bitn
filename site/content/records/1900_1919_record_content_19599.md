Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co.  It has been generally very quiet with very little tributing work going on.  Work in the creek about two miles south of Burra is progressing, but the ore bed is cutting out and not much more will be done there.  It was expected this would be profitable, but with men on wages of 3/- to 6/8 a day it will likely make a loss.  The last returns were 6Â½%.  The option said to be held over the property by Mr Horne expires in about a month.
