I came to Burra at the start of 1993 from Roseworthy College where I have been conducting research into Animal Nutrition and have been a part-time lecturer in Computing and Animal Sciences.  I teach a range of students from Years 7 through 12.  Currently we are growing vegetables with Years 7 & 8 and meat birds with Year 7.  The Upper secondary students are involved in farm management issues and mixed farming subjects and later will be preparing three steers for the Royal Adelaide Show.  I live at Riverton on a farm with my wife Nikki, who is expecting our second child and my daughter Kasey.  I enjoy playing basketball and tennis and have converted from rugby to Australian Rules for the Riverton Hawks.  [Photo.]
