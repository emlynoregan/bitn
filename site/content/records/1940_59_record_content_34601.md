Mainly news with one or two large advertisements.

Page 2

Sales notices, small advertisements, public notices and these sometimes extend to page 3.  Little if any news.

Page 3

Large advertisements with some news and this format continues on pages 4, 5, 6, 7, & 8.

With five columns the paper rarely had more than two columns of news and carried many advertisements that were two columns wide.

Overall news coverage was good, but extended further afield, extending the district especially to the northwest and north.  Hallett received more attention than earlier.

Editorial comment was very limited.
