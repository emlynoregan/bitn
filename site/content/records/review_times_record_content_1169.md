Burra Hospital.  Chairman of the Board Mr R.K. Pearse delivered the 100th Annual Report and pointed out that in the past two years a nett surplus of $17,595 had been achieved.  This was largely due to the fact that most people were privately insured.  Wages accounted for 78% of costs.  Daily average patient rate was a record 30.72 and 25 babies were born in the year.  The Board was very appreciative of the work of Matron Phillips and her staff.  The work of the Hospital Auxiliary was also appreciated.
