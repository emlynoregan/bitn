A.B. Riggs writes re the racecourse as a sports ground.

He is concerned that the phrase ‘left in perpetuity as a sports ground for Burra citizens’ reads well, but doesn’t get us far legally.  If the trustees were to transfer the freehold to the Council, in trust then we could get somewhere.

As for Victoria Park; not much has really been spent on it.  It could be enlarged if the land to the south could be bought from the present owner.  He says he is prepared to donate £20 if nine others are also and with the £400 Swimming Pool money a good start could be made.

There has been a lot of talk; it is time we got together and did something.
