Wendy Richards

I am teaching one of the R/1 classes in the junior Primary Section.  I completed the Bachelor of Teaching (Junior Primary) as a mature age student on 1991.  My family, husband John and sons Matthew and Daniel and I then moved from Adelaide to Blyth.  Since then I have had teaching contracts at Clare and Booborowie and have relieved at seven other schools in the area.  [Photo.]
