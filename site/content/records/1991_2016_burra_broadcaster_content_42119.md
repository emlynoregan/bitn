The weather for the show was excellent, following a month of unpredictable conditions that included cyclones and floods.  There were trade sites, rides, the ute show, tractor display, food stalls and plenty of competitions.  The pavilion was full of entries and the scarecrow competition on the hill was an interesting innovation.  Many returned for the evening entertainment with its amazing fireworks display.
