Burra Town Council, 24 April

The Mayor & Crs Bevan, Harvey & Lee have all agreed to stand again for Council.

Cr Bevan complained that the street light near the railway crossing in Burra North had been out for nearly a month despite being reported.

The company will be asked to fix lights as soon as they are notified.

A light will be placed in front of the Aberdeen Lodge Hall to be maintained by the lodge.
