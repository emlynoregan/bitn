Accident.  A 16-year-old youth lost control of his parents’ Toyota Sylvia sedan in crossing the bridge in Young Street.  The car slid sideways along Young Street, collided with the curb in front of Sara’s, overturned and smashed the old red phone box, took out a verandah post and ended on its hood without breaking any glass in Sara’s windows.  The accident appeared to be the result of speed and inexperience.  The driver and passengers had only minor injuries and James Reilly had a lucky escape, as he was just about to use the phone box.
