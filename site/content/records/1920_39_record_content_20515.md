Hanson District Council met on 28 August and appointed Mr H.C. Barnes District Clerk, Secretary under the Local Board of Health, Overseer of Works, District Ranger, Inspector under the Vermin, Width of Tyres, Noxious Weeds, Sparrow and Weights & Measures Acts and Inspector under the Local Board of Health for Â£5-10-0 per week.

Chairman Cr J. Denton said he had legal advice that Mr Frank Treloar was entitled to be paid six months salary in lieu of notice.

Cr Bailey moved that Mr Treloar be paid six months salary in lieu of notice.  Not seconded.

The Chairman said he considered that after their treatment of Mr Treloar following 27 years service he could not continue and resigned the position.

Mr Treloar considers he has been badly treated.
