Accidents.  Straying sheep caused two accidents recently.  On Tuesday a Ford utility collided with sheep on the Barrier Highway about 2 km west of Burra and sustained about $1,000 damage.  About half an hour later a Holden Barina driven by a Peterborough woman collided with sheep in the same area.  The car rolled over and sustained some $15,000 damages.  The driver sustained minor injuries.  Landowners are reminded that stock control is their responsibility and owners are liable in the event of accidents.
