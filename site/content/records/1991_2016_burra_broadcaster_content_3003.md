The SA Tourism Commissioner & CEO explained at a meeting in Burra on Thursday the intention to reduce regions from 13 to 9, by merging some, including the Yorke Peninsula and the Mid North.  A shake-up in tourism was needed: days spent in SA by interstate and overseas visitors had decreased by 16% and hotel-motel occupancy was barely 50%.  The reasons for the merging of Yorke Peninsula and the Mid North, however, seemed to fail to convince listeners.
