Afternoon tea was served and a social took place in St Mary’s Schoolroom in the evening.  Addresses were given by several gentlemen.  Sir F.W. Holder, the Wertheim Sewing Machine Co. and Messrs Urwin & Sons offered prizes for the best scholarship, but as entries were too few they were held over till next half term.
