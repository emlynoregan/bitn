New Train Timetable

From 1 April 1885

From the north to Adelaide	Arrive 7.44 a.m.	Depart 7.44 a.m. [sic]

Arrive 4.26 p.m.	Depart 4.26 p.m. [sic]

From Adelaide to the North	Arrive 12.23 p.m.	Depart 12.29 p.m.

Arrive 9.31 p.m.	Depart 9.38 p.m.

This was arranged to allow connections with the Wallaroo line trains, but the earlier afternoon train, by 40 minutes is awkward for the Burra sales.
