John Reed’s car rolled over twice near Frank Ford’s on Friday night c. 9 p.m. and he was thrown out and knocked unconscious.  When he came round about 3 a.m. he called out loudly which roused Ford’s dogs so that Mr Ford went to investigate.  Dr Ashton was sent for and determined that Mr Reed had broken his thigh.  He is recovering from this, shock and severe bruising at the Burra Hospital.
