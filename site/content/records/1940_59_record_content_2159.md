St Joseph’s Church Annual Dance was held in the Institute on Wednesday last and was a brilliant success.  The music was by Dick Trevorrow’s Orchestra from Jamestown.

Mr W. Ryan, after some years’ residence in Burra, has gone to further engage in the dental profession in Eudunda and was given a presentation at the St Joseph’s Annual Dance.
