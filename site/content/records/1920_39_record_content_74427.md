Sheep Stealing.  On Friday at Burra Police Court Harold Frederick Saunders, late manager of Gum Creek Station and Johnson Garfield Carpenter were charged with stealing 50 lambs valued at £50 the property of Sir Walter Duncan.  They were committed for trial at the Supreme Court in Adelaide.

Mr Battye of Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. noticed the lambs at the Abattoirs Market.  They were sold through Oates & Co. and as all Gum Creek sales went through his company he thought it odd and contacted Sir Walter Duncan.  When questioned, Saunders eventually admitted he was in desperate financial straits and admitted his guilt.  Evidence was given by Harry Beaumont Battye.

Henry Herbert Brown, boundary rider for Gum Creek said Mr Saunders had instructed him to bring in a mob of 300 sheep off the lucerne and he and Mr Saunders had then drafted off 45-50 lambs and he was instructed to put them in the shed.  They were gone in the morning.  He did not at the time suspect the lambs were being stolen.

Detective Sgt William Gill of Adelaide said that when they interviewed Carpenter he had said he did a little dealing and prior to taking the 50 lambs to the market they had been at Woollacott’s.  He had sold them through Oates & Co. and got £40-12-0 and something for them and had the cheque at home.  He insisted he had not picked them up at Gum Creek Station.  He was told they had been identified as belonging to Sir Walter Duncan and that Saunders had said Carpenter had picked them up at 7 p.m. on Tuesday last and loaded them on his truck.  Carpenter then admitted he had done so and that Saunders had asked him to sell them in his own name.  He added that Saunders had come to him c. 9.30 p.m. the previous night and said if questioned he was to say he got them from Woollacott’s.  Saunders had refused to take the cheque then, saying he would pick it up later.  He admitted taking three or four lots of sheep away for Saunders on previous occasions.

Gill said that Saunders had not told him whether or not Carpenter knew the sheep were stolen.

Detective Sgt Walters of Adelaide said Saunders told him he had been manager of Gum Creek for about 26 years.  He had sent 50 lambs to market by a carrier named Carpenter; that he has mustered the sheep alone and no one had help draft them.  He had not told Carpenter to use any particular agent.  He said he did not have the cheque for the lambs.  When later confronted Saunders admitted his wife had been ill and they had a lot of doctor’s bills and he needed money.  He admitted that Carpenter had sold sheep for him previously on three or four occasions, but he could not give dates.  Saunders did not say that Carpenter knew the sheep were stolen.

Mr Philcox for Carpenter said there was no admissible evidence that Carpenter knew the sheep were stolen.  All that could be said was that he was in possession of stolen goods without evidence that he knew they were stolen.  He had lied to police at the request of Saunders and he had thought Saunders had the authority to sell the sheep.  The Bench decided there was a case to answer.

J.G. Carpenter reserved his defence and was bailed.

H.F. Saunders pleaded guilty and did not ask for bail.
