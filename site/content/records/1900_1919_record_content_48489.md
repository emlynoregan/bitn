Burra Cheer-up Society held a social on 9 November in honour of Signaller W.J. Lavey and Driver Drury.  Lts Queale and Catt were also present.  [None of these seem to be locals.]  Photos have been received of Driver J. Heinrich, Pte C. Jesser and Seaman Harry Vivian.  The girls who have volunteered to work up a band are all Cheer-up girls.  Nine cases of goods were sent to Lady Galway’s Club House.
