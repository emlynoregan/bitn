Solomon Williams of Glenelg writes some reminiscences of the Burra Institute.

He says he remembers the talk in the 1850s of getting an Institute when he was a boy.  It was said a library and a free public reading room would be a great boon.  A public hall was needed since at the time the only suitable place for public meetings was the Assembly Room at the Burra Hospital (now the Hospital), which was badly situated.  A more central place was thought advisable.  But after all Mr Williams says it was not very convenient and to some extent this has militated against its success.  Those who worked at the mine were those at whom a Mechanicsâ€™ Institute was aimed, but in fact many were quite illiterate and a library and reading room had no attraction for them.  Also their day was long and they felt little like going up the hill to the Institute in the evening.  He remembers lectures by Rev. D.J. H. Ibbitson [sic: Ibbetson] and one on Astronomy illustrated by Magic Lantern powered by Colsa* oil.  The slides were hand painted and some were mechanical to show the movement of planets etc.  Another lawyer gave a lecture on William Shakespeare, but was delayed at Court in Redruth and the time was filled in by recitations and readings by Charlie Oldham the teller at the National Bank.  Williams says he often visited the reading room to read the Illustrated London News, the Graphic and Punch, also The Wallet a weekly publication by Miss Catherine Helen Spence.  He was also a subscriber for a short time before leaving Burra in 1867.
