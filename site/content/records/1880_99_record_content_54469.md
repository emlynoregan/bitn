Editorial on The Town Council.

At the last meeting on Wednesday afternoon all went smoothly until Cr Harris moved that the engineer, Mr Littlejohn receive notice ‘that his services would not be required after the expiration of one month’.  There was a heated discussion before the motion was carried.  Crs Harris, Sampson, West and Parks voting for and Walsh and Linkson opposed.  The circumstances surrounding the case of the unfortunate engineer are very strange and until there is a public investigation the facts will not be known.

On 20 June Crs Harris and Sampson complained of the work done by the engineer and subsequently they resigned from the Waterworks Committee.  A meeting or two later Cr Sampson moved and Cr Harris 2nd that the whole Council constitute itself a Waterworks Commission with the Mayor as Chairman and ‘the engineer take all orders through the Mayor’.  A long list of work was prepared and every item carried out.  Still complaints followed and a second list was prepared and this was so long that one Councillor thought it would take the engineer three months to attend to all items.  Again the Mayor reported all the work had been completed satisfactorily.  Again complaints were received in defiance of the Mayor’s favourable reports.  We believe the engineer will ask for a public investigation into the matter.  If the charges against Mr Littlejohn are true he deserves no consideration, but if they are not the Councillors who brought them should be dealt with by extreme measures.
