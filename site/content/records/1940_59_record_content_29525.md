Burra High School Speech Night was held last night in the Burra Town Hall.  The assembly room at the High School had previously been used, but the crowd was now too large for that venue.

The scholars opened with the School Hymn and this was followed by:

The Eton Boating Song

Away for Rio

Playing on De Ole Banjo

Headmaster H.O. Pederick then delivered his report for 1946.  [This is printed in full in just under 2 columns.]

The High School enrolment of 73 for 1946 was a record; the highest previous total being 65.  The 1947 enrolment is expected to exceed 80 and consequently a new room has been promised for the new year.  Last year seven of nine Intermediate candidates passed the full certificate with seven or more subjects and the other two passed five subjects each.

The staff of Mr Burdon, Miss Butler, Mr Laubsch and Miss Tapley put in a great effort as an extra teacher should have been supplied.  A bus service from Willalo via Hallett and Mt Bryan brought in just below 20 on average.  Thanks go to Mr A.G. Hanlin as driver.

The whole school visited Adelaide early in April and among places visited were:

Wyles Chromium Works

Adelaide Joinery Works

Rossela [sic] Manufacturing Co.

Amscol

Adelaide Fire Station

Botanic Gardens

Art Gallery

Museum

Parliament House

Technical night classes in Woodwork and night and day classes in Dressmaking were instituted.

Intermediate Drawing was introduced and in 1947 Bookkeeping will be re-introduced, possibly as an alternative to Latin in First year.

Money is being spent improving Physical Education and Sports equipment and on the Library.

Regular inter-school sports matches have been played and the Annual Sports Day was held in August, in which the Senior Cups went to Mary Pearce and Rex Haese and the Junior Cups to Dawn Bernhardt and Francis Ford [Frances in the paper.]

BHS competed in the Mid North High schools Sports Meeting at Kapunda and although it was the smallest school in the competition it came second to Clare.

In 1947 this event will be hosted by Burra.

[The headmaster then went on to thank the School Council and the Parents & Friends’ Association.]

The loss by departure from the town of Dr Steele is greatly regretted.  He had been President of the High School Council for about 26 years.  It had been decided to name one of the two Houses at the School Steele House and the other Draysey House in honour of a previous Acting Headmaster who gave his life in WWII.

Also lost to the school community this year with regret were Mrs C. Pearce, for many years Treasurer of the Parents & Friends’ Association and Mr G.P. S. Harvey, who had been an active Council Member.

[A list of others who were thanked then followed.]
