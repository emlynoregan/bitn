Burra Town Council, 18 April.

Various road repair matters were attended to.

Cr Sampson was not satisfied with the standard of work done in Queen St.

Tree planting was brought up and referred to a committee.

Damage to the oval wall was again considered.

Cr Sampson said the Show Soc. Had appointed a committee to confer with Council re a permanent structure at the oval to accommodate the public and moved the Council appoint a committee to discuss the matter with them.

Cr West 2nd.  Cr Hardy opposed the motion until the committee appeared before Council.

Cr Rabbich agreed: they should not go out of their way to meet the committee â€“ the committee should wait on the Council.  Motion lost.

The new By-Law.

Cr Hardy moved the old by-law be rescinded and replaced by the one read last meeting.

Cr Harris 2nd.

Cr Sampson opposed it as iniquitous, unfair and not asked for.  He outlined his objections along now familiar lines.

Cr Rabbich cut off the speech by moving the house divide.  Not 2nd.

But the Mayor put the original motion.

For: Hardy, Harris, Parks and Rabbich.

Opposed: Sampson & West.

Cr Rabbich moved the by-law be printed.

Cr Sampson gave notice he would move at the next Council for a call of Council to rescind the minute of 17 December 1894, which gave all printing for 1895 to the News office.
