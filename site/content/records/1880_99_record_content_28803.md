The Chinese Question.

Mr Playford at the Sydney Conference submitted:

Chinese immigration to the colonies be further restricted.

The Imperial Government be asked to interfere diplomatically with China with a view to settle the question in accordance with Australian views.

A committee be set up to draft a Bill to obtain uniform laws in the colonies.

His ideas were not extreme enough for others at the gathering.
