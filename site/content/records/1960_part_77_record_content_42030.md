The Walk Against want organised by Burra Rural Youth saw 237 starters and raised $1,950 in rather wintry conditions.  Mayor E.T. Baulderstone congratulated walkers and hoped their effort would return many dollars for the worthy cause.  Sgt Orford urged walkers to take care, as the route was a main highway.  Mr Claude Allen MP said a similar event at Berri the week before had raised $1,400.  Mrs Allen cut the ribbon to start the walk.  The oldest contestant was Barney Rodgers at 67, who completed the course and added $50 to the fund.  The youngest was Heather Hanlin of Hallett whose 1 mile added $1.  Wally Scottâ€™s sponsorship of $4 per mile raised the most: $80.  Raymond Spackman was the fastest to Hallett and won a turkey donated by Mrs A.J. Broad.

[Walkers completing the various distances up to the complete 20 miles are listed and some more were added in 91, 40 (2), 8 Oct. 1968, page 6.  Two were added 91, 41 (2), 15 Oct. 1968, page 6 and more were added 91, 42 (2), 22 Oct. 1968, page 6.]
