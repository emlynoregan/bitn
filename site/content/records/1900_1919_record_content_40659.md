Redruth Local Court.

George Thorpe sued Murray Aunger Ltd, Motor Importers, for £490 damages for libel.  Thorpe had been manager for Murray Aunger in Burra for some years.  W.J. Davey Jun. had purchased from Thorpe an electric torch for 5/6.  He had paid Thorpe two weeks later and Thorpe had promised to send a receipt, but didn’t do so and Davey continued to get accounts for it.  Davey wrote explaining the matter after receiving the 2nd monthly account.  The company replied that having checked the matter with Mr Thorpe they believed the account was in order, but they would get back to Mr Thorpe and would let Davey know the result in due course.  When the company wrote to Thorpe he contacted his solicitors who wrote to the company expressing his offence at the implication of their letter to Davey.  Thorpe says he handed the money to J. Richards Jun., the bookkeeper, who then apparently failed to issue a receipt, though questioned twice on the matter.  Thorpe denied:

He was ever questioned by the company about the matter

That he ever said the account was quite in order

That he had no right to accept the money

The letter to Davey was a false and malicious libel that injured Thorpe’s reputation for honest dealing.  The company replied that before leaving their employ he had gone through the accounts and certified the list of outstanding debts to be correct.  The list included the 5/6 for the torch.

The defence said the words complained of did not bear the meaning put on them.

[Thorpe had since transferred to manage Eyes and Crowles which had started under Thorpe.]

The very detailed evidence traces the company’s change of management to J.W. Richards and Thorpe’s subsequent departure, and runs for over four columns on page 1 with a concluding paragraph on page 4.

The court summed up in favour of the complainant and the jury assessed damages at £100 plus costs.
