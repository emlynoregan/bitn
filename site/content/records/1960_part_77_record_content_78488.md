Basketball

The North-Eastern International Rules Basketball Association was formed on 28 October 1970.

There were then five men’s teams: Clare, Torreston, Hallett, Burra Blue and Burra White.

And three women’s teams: Hallett, Torreston and Burra.

For 1971-72 Burra added a further men’s team and another women’s team.

In 1972-73 the men’s teams were Hallett, Torreston and three Burra teams.

The women’s teams numbered five.

On 20 June 1973 the North-Eastern and the Spalding Associations merged.

For the 1973-74 season Burra supplied one men’s team and one women’s team and in all the Association comprised 6 men’s teams and 4 women’s teams.

The line-up for 1974-75 was unchanged and in 1975-76 season Burra High School added a men’s team.

This season Burra entered three men’s teams and one women’s team.  Letters have been sent out to see if a Burra Association could be formed.
