Redruth Over 50 Years Ago

This is written by ‘Unohoo’, but the author’s identity has not been established.  This is the first in a series and this time comprises the reminiscences of Miss J. Pilz.

She tells mainly of the Primitive Methodist Church in Redruth, which was being used by 1940 as a storeroom by Kakoschke’s.  She names many of the adherents of the church.  The Sunday school anniversaries were always held on Easter Sunday with the tea meeting on Easter Monday.  There were at the time two post offices at the north end of town: one in Redruth run by A. Bartholomaeus and one in Aberdeen run by James Tiver.  There were four hotels: The Bon Accord, The [Royal] Exchange, The Court House Hotel and Opie’s.  [The latter is wrongly said to be located ‘at the Mine Bridge’.]

She went to a private school near the Court House, run by Miss Goss.

She lists some of the students and says she can just remember the opening of the Burra Public School.

There were several stores:

Mr J. Tiver kept one and A. Bartholomaeus another.  Mr Linkson kept one opposite the Methodist Church.  Mr Day had one in Aberdeen and Mr Lowe another in Redruth.

The Butchers were Mr Austin and Mr Rabbich and Mr Gebhardt.  The bakers were Mr Lowe and Mr Morgan.  80 years ago her father planted almond trees on the property where Willie Lomman now lives and also the beautiful mulberry tree.
