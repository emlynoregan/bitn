10 December

Robert Carson case resumed.

James Tarr said he had bought the bullock as one of two from Joseph Wasley.

Joseph Wasley said he had bought it from William Bartle (who had gone to California) and sold it to James Tarr.

William Tregea was present when Wasley bought the bullock and when Bartle had made his mark on the receipt.

His Worship ruled that the defendant was unable to show by evidence that the bullock belonged to him and ordered it be returned to the complainant.
