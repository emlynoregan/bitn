Obituary.  Michael Joseph Hogan aged 11 and a son of Mr & Mrs John E. Hogan of Hanson was killed when he fell from the Adelaide train between Burra & Hanson.  He was travelling with Colin J. Hogan, son of P.W. Hogan.  Colin told two military policemen on the train that he thought Joseph had fallen from the observation platform of the carriage.  At Hanson the stationmaster Mr Johnson and his wife searched and found the boy in a disused quarry by the track.  He would have fallen 18-20ft.  Dr Steele pronounced life extinct on arriving at the scene.  [The registration of death on the CD is cited as 11 November 1943, presumably the month being an error for January.]
