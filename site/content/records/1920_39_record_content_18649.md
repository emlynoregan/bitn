‘A Returned Soldier’ writes concerning the guns.  He contends that the Council is acting unfairly in not consulting the Memorial Committee and the Returned Soldiers and the local trustees for the Defence Department.  If they are playthings for boys where they are they would be more so if placed where the Council wants.  As for Cr Woollacott’s comments that there are no guns in King William St: he might note there are however a couple in front of the Art Gallery.  He is glad that now Dr Steele and the RSA are being consulted.

[He also says that his father is a soldier of several wars, which would make it interesting to learn his identity!]
