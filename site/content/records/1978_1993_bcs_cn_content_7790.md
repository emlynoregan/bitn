Burra Burra DC

Burra has received a massive $470,000 grant as a package project for SA Jubilee 150 Celebrations.

This is a huge slice of the $2 million allocated to SA.  $270,000 is to be spent setting up the Salvation Army Citadel as a Copper Museum Interpretive Centre.  $150,000 will be spent on further restoration work at Paxton Square cottages.  $25,000 will continue work on Morphett’s Pump House and $25,000 will go towards restoration of Bon Accord Buildings.
