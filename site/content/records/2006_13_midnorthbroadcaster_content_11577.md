Merrie Elliott of Burra writes:

Emergency services at Burra Hospital were going along normally until one day in April 2010 our doctor’s right to attend emergencies there was abruptly terminated.  Country Health SA offered no real reason for this other than to say the doctor was no longer qualified to undertake these duties.   Since then concerned members of the public have had interviews with the Premier Mike Rann, Health Minister John Hill, representatives of Country Health SA and Tony Gwynn-Jones chair of Lower North Health Advisory Service.  Despite emails, letters petitions etc. it has been impossible to get straight answers.  The Minister and Country Health persistently advise us that nothing has changed and that Emergency Services are operating as normal.  This is of course nonsense.  Either a doctor has to come from Clare or the patient has to be sent elsewhere after assessment by the triage nurses.  With lawyers, those masters of expensive delay now lurking on the scene, there is little hope of a speedy resolution.  Country Health SA has been remarkable for obfuscation, lack of transparency and conflicting stories.  Many are now beginning to wonder if there is a long term plan to close down the Burra Hospital and all this is a softening up process.  Despite assurances from Minister Hill that this is not the case, the process is causing this fear to grow.  The transfer of the ownership of the hospital to the LNHAC (Lower North Health Advisory Council – a body with little actual connection to Burra – is not reassuring.

‘We don’t now need to one morning discover that Burra no longer has a hospital or even a doctor, with residents then forced to go to Clare or wherever for even the most minor treatments…Burra needs to retain its hospital, a doctor and proper emergency service.
