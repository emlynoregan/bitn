Burra News, 1 July

Last Sunday the Bishop of Adelaide confirmed about 30 young persons at the Church of England.  A large congregation assembled.  His Lordship preached two sermons on the same day.

On Monday evening Rev. L.W. Stanton presented one of his usual entertainments.  On this occasion a chief attraction was a lecture by the Lord Bishop on The early colonisation of the United States of America.  Rev. Stanton gave three amusing readings and others presented songs and music.  Proceeds went towards the repair of the parsonage at Redruth.

The new enginehouse [at Graves’ Shaft] is progressing favourably and will probably be completed in about seven or eight weeks.  The shaft is now down to more than 40 fathoms and has a little water, but not enough to retard operations significantly.
