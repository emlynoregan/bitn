C. Gaghen’s Show has four men sinking pits on small quartz leaders.  Ore has been followed down 20 ft and driven on for 30 ft north of the shaft.  Lode formation at the end of the drive is 18 inches wide with traces of gold.  No loaming has been done on this section and it was advised that miners loam the hillside before putting down holes indiscriminately.
