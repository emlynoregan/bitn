Misunderstandings followed re the Board’s aims and attitude and this seems to have influenced Dr Ashton in the way he carried out or refused to carry out his duties.  He refused to attend Board meetings, took exception to a request to place his instructions in writing, he fixed operations times that gave maximum disturbance to hospital routines and made visits commonly at meal times.  He was removed from office as MO, on the grounds that he disregarded the Board’s instructions, on 5 July 1917.

Recommendations

Hospital rules should be revised to:

bring them within the terms of the Act of Parliament

regulate the admission of patients

establish a proper routine of hours for ward visits, operations and other necessary matters

Admission of members of friendly societies and those with infectious diseases should be made only under arrangements with the societies and Local Boards of Health respectively.

Only persons unable to pay for attendance should be admitted free of charge – except for emergencies and accidents where the Board should consider each patient’s circumstances.

The duties and responsibilities of the Inspector-General of Hospitals need proper definition.

The Government should consider appointing a medical practitioner as Government MO at the hospital at a reasonable salary with the right of private practice.

S.J. Mitchell, Chairman
