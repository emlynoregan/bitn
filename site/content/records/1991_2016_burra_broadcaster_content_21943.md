Burra Sports Complex held its AGM recently.  President Trevor Wall reported on the year.  Improvements continue to be made.  This year activity focused on the netball/tennis courts.  This included the donation and placement of a secure storeroom and the construction of a clubhouse.  The problem of slippery surfaces when wet is being addressed.  The oval surface is in the best condition in memory.  Speed humps have slowed traffic flow at the oval.  There were two break-ins during the year.  Bar stock and electric items were taken.  Insurance covered some of the loss.  Insurance cover has been increased and a security system installed.

Elected: President, Trevor Wall; Vice President, Paul Wilson; Secretary, Celine stockman and Treasurer, Di Day.
