Migration from the Burra

The vacant acre between King William and Weymouth Streets near the Post Office was enlivened on Monday night by an overland party and their three drays on the way from the Burra to Mount Alexander.  The party comprised the drivers, their wives and families, numbering at least 20 persons.  One man spoke of leaving his little cottage at the Burra, for which a month ago he was offered Â£20, but which he had now sold, together with 30/- worth of firewood, for a mere 10/-.  His party, he said, had ten drays, but seven were a stage behind.  They anticipate making 15 miles a day, having been informed there is plenty of feed.
