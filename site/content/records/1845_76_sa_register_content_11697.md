Obituary/Inquest.  An inquest was held last week on the body of a lad named Roach, who was found drowned in a waterhole at Baldina.  He was out bullock-hunting with his father, another man and a boy.  The boys and men had separated and on going round the edge of a waterhole, the boy stood on an overhanging section of bank and fell in.  The other lad tried to help, but when he was unable to save the boy it was almost two hours before assistance could be obtained.  The jury returned a verdict of accidental death.

[Thomas Roach died 4 May 1858 Baldina, residence Kooringa aged 11.  He seems to have been the son of Thomas Roach 1817-82 who arrived in SA with his family in 1848. (BISA)]
