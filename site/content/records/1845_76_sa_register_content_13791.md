Kooringa News, 21 November

A local sensation occurred in the past week when a local man named Davey eloped with another manâ€™s wife.  He deserted his own wife and children and neglected to pay his creditors.  This caused a telegram to be sent to Kapunda where he was detained.  On his return to Kooringa he was greeted by a large crowd and escorted to the Police station amid the scorn and derision of the multitude.  After a trial in the local court he was discharged on legal and technical grounds.  His disgrace and punishment continued.  Yesterday evening his paramour, who incidentally is a grandmother, returned and provoked another display of popular indignation.  The crowd accompanied her to her residence and to a late hour provided every species of insult, annoyance and abuse.

The Institute subscribers met on Monday evening to revise the rules.  On change has provided for use of the library only for 10/- p.a., without other privileges such as access to lectures or the reading room.

A cricket match between Burra and Hamilton on Friday last resulted in the utter defeat of the Hamiltonians in one innings.  Apart from the fielding of the Hamiltonians the standard of play was good on both sides.
