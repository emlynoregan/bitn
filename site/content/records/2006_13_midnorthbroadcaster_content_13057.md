Stuart Norris writes on the same issue. He was at first enraged by the attack on one of the town’s leading citizens.

He makes a series of points.

Burra exists because of mining.

Many tourists come because of our mining heritage.

The Monster Mine saved the state from bankruptcy.

As for the Waihi evidence.  Statistics can be manipulated at will.  Many hippies moved there in the 1970s and 1980s and this may skew unemployment.  A large number of old age pensioners can also skew income figures.

Mines can co-exist with successful towns as in Mt Isa, Broken Hill, Kalgoorlie, Ballarat and Bendigo.

Phoenix Copper welcomed submissions to the Minister about any concerns and welcomes anyone to speak to them about concerns.

Phoenix wished to explore around the old mine area.

Jobs for locals would be created.

No historic building would be demolished.

If a sizeable deposit was discovered they would have to apply for permission to mine that deposit.

No homes in Burra would fall into the pit.  Assertions along these lines are not based on facts.

Mine workers would spend money in the town.  To assert that money from the mine would not find its way into local businesses is not true.

When mining ceases Burra would be much the same as now.

All environmental aspects would have to be adhered to, revegetation would have to be undertaken and the clean-up carried out by the mining company.

At a town meeting in 2010 60% of the people were in favour of a mine starting.

If you don’t like living in a mining town you are always welcome to leave.

Let’s hope the Minister grants Phoenix Copper the exploration rights it is seeking

The town needs a boost, even if the mine lasts only five years.
