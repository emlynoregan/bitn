Redruth Court

William Stafford sued John Sampson Jun. for £50 for falsely and maliciously causing the plaintiff to be arrested on a charge of larceny as a bailee.

[Bailee is one to whom a delivery in trust is made.]

Last year the plaintiff said he received £6 from the defendant as a mortgage on his horse, cart and harness.  (He was a fish hawker between Morgan, Eudunda and Burra.)  The defendant said he had purchased the items and lent them to the plaintiff for 3/- a week.  Soon after this the plaintiff disappeared and the defendant issued a warrant for his arrest.  The plaintiff said that as the money was a loan he should have been sued in a civil court.  As it was the plaintiff had been arrested at Canowie, but the case was dismissed on the non-appearance of the defendant.  There is almost a whole column of detail and in the end the plaintiff was awarded only £10 damages plus costs because the bench held that ‘the proceedings had been brought about by his own folly'.
