Cr Kellock, who is also a member of the District Council said that the DC had inspected the yards, thought the cost of repairs would be high, but then decided to go back to Major Lewis.  The subcommittee’s recommendation was adopted.

The Fire Brigade contribution for the year will be £74.

The secretary of the Department of Lands advises that Booborowie Forest Lands have been thrown open for application.

The RSA [RSL] advised of its resolution re the guns.

The Mayor enquired as to the identity of the trustees of the guns.

The Town Clerk supplied correspondence showing the guns had been applied for by the Town Council and allotted to the Corporation.  One had come from the War Trophy Committee.  The agreement form signed by four trustees was a formality: they were the Mayor, E.W. Crewes, Cr M.A. Radford, Mr S.M. Lane (representing the AIF) and the Town Clerk Mr E.J. Davey.  But they had no control over the guns, which were the property of the town – the trustees merely acted for the town.

The Mayor: ‘We want now to put the blame of the guns being in such a shocking state on the right shoulders.  The wheels can be shaken to pieces.’

Various letters re the guns were read.  The Mayor said that there was absolutely nothing in the correspondence to support E.W. Crewes’ allegation that the Hon. W.M. Hughes gave the guns on condition that the original scheme shown in the window of the Record office was carried out.

Cr Kellaway thought they should bring the whole matter before the public and see if the patriotic pledges of Mr Crewes and others would be carried out.

Mr Crewes’ letter ‘was full of trash and untruths’. 

It was a question of whether he and others would carry out the pledges they had neglected to fulfil.

Cr Kellock gave notice of a motion to rescind the decision to move the guns.

The meeting then went on to consider the state of various roads.

A Buck-jumping Show has been organised by Lance Skuthorp for Victoria Park on 26 & 27 February.  Over 100 horses are coming.  The star horse will be Firefly said to have thrown more men than any other in Australia.
