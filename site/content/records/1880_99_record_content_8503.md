Lines v. Schutz and Schutz v. Lines

Mrs Schutz took Lines’ cab to the station to find her husband, but failing to do so, she took the same cab back and found him at Market Square.

He asked her why she did not ride in her own cab and an altercation between the two cab drivers led to the assaults complained of.

Schutz was fined 5/- + £3-12-0 expenses and bound over to keep the peace on his own recognisance of £20.

His counter claim was dismissed.
