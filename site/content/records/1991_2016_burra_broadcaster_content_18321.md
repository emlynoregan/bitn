Burra Silo Committee held a post-harvest meeting.  Recently the railway line past the cells has been covered with gravel, allowing B-double road trains to load grain without unhooking.  A proposed change at the silos was to build a chute from a cell to the outloader chute, which would enable the silo to receive and also operate the outloader at the same time.  This would cost in the vicinity of $35,000 and may be budgeted for in the next year.

[Note that this report confirms the effective closure of the Burra railway line.  A grain train was reported for January 1999 and the above confirms that rail access to the silos was then terminated.  No passenger trains had used the line since the Australian Railway Historical Societyâ€™s special on 19 September 1992.  The last regular passenger train was on 13 December 1986.]
