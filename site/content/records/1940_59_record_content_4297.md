Carols.  Inaugurated by Rev. C. Gray, the Anglican and Kooringa Methodist Choirs, with other friends, at the close of the Sunday evening service treated residents to good carol singing.  They were driven around the town on a lorry with Pte Clem Davey playing a little organ thereon.  They called first at the Hospital and then toured the streets.
