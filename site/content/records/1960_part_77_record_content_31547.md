Aberdeen Tennis Club held its AGM recently.  The club was in credit $164.

President Robert Reed reported at length.

The season had one A team and two B teams as well as a junior team.  The A and junior teams were premiers.

The three courts were top dressed.  A cyclone fence was erected and the toilets were painted and the new toilets have been paid off.  Lloyd Turner and his family were farewelled in late July, having been stalwart supporters.  The Easter Tournament was the highlight of the year and saw record entries and excellent weather.  Thanks are extended to I. Hirschausen and to BHS for the use of their courts.

[Details of the President’s Report extend for c. 1½ columns.]
