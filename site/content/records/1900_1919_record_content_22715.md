Railway accident.  A young railway employee mistakenly sent a number of trucks down the siding to the ballast quarry a few evenings ago, where they collided with others and damaged 15-20 wagons.  Several nearby workers were lucky to escape injury.  The young man has been suspended.  The wreckage was cleared on Wednesday in about four hours of meritorious work.
