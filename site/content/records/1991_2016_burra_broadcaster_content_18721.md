Letter.  R.S.F. Coaker, a visitor from the UK on a 10th visit to Adelaide made a first visit to Burra.  He writes to praise the wonderful efforts of a guide at Malowen Lowarth, who dressed the part and brought to life the lives of people in the 19th century [Marge Edwards].  But he also points out the number of freeloaders they encountered trying to get into sites without the key.
