Burra Institute’s Liabilities

AA round-table conference discussed the financial difficulties of the Burra Institute and appealed to S. Jefferies to intercede for them with the State Bank.  Mr Wilkinson said the Institute was up against it.  In good times the then hall would not accommodate the people and so the then committee added a gallery and supper room.  Since the depression they had not been able to meet the financial demand caused by the expenditure.  The Treasurer Mr Max Pearce then read a statement about their financial position.  They had been unable to meet their interest payments since the withdrawal of the Government subsidy in 1931 and the big shrinkage in revenue due to the depression.  The terms required a repayment to the State Bank of £240-16-2 annually, made up of £86-4-4 of principal and £154-11-10 in interest.  Repayment of principal had been out of the question for the last three years and now they were in arrears with interest about £326-5-7.  In summary:

The loan was for	£3,000

Less repayment of	£304-5-3

Plus interest arrears

(to July 1934)	£326-5-7

Total owing	£3,121-10-10

They were seeking a way out.  They had asked the Bank to capitalise interest arrears, and reduce the interest at least to 4% and suspend repayment of principal for a year or so and then they believed they could get through it.  The Bank’s response had not been favourable and had they had simply repeated their demands.

Mr Bednall said for the last 12 months income had been only £450.  When the loan had been granted the income had been about £800 p.a. with a Government grant of £150.  With the exception of £50 that had to be spent on books the latter had been cut out.  At present they could pay £140 p.a. and more as conditions improved.  The only other solution was for the Council to take over the Institute and strike a rate for its maintenance, but they did not want to do that.  The property was valued at £6,000.

Mr Jefferies said he could not see why the interest arrears could not be capitalised.  If that were done the interest payments could be met and the whole position would mark time for a while.  He wondered if a private loan might help – perhaps from the AMP Society.  He would pass on a statement of receipts and expenditure etc. to the Bank, but stressed that the bank was an independent body and he could not exert political influence upon it.

A Civic Banquet for the visiting dignitaries was held at the Burra Hotel about 6.30 p.m.  The speeches at the toasts are reported.

A Public Meeting was held at the Institute on Friday evening to hear the Premier and the visiting Minister and MPs.  The Premier spoke of the work of the Lyons Federal Government in improving Australia’s financial position – producing large budget surpluses and saving £2,500,000 in interest charges.  He went on to say how all this progress would be lost if labour were to be returned in the coming Federal Election.  He also continued in this same election mode to deal with the agricultural situation.  Unemployment had improved in the past year.  He spoke of the Farmers’ Relief Acts since 1931 and of the Commonwealth bounty to wheat-growers and the reductions in rail freight charges for primary producers.

Mr Jefferies also spoke.  He reflected on his visits to schools that day and on the way the Government was dealing with unemployment problems.
