Characteristics of the 1971 paper.

A fair coverage of local issues along with a number of general interest articles.  There are very few photographs of local events and generally they appear well after the occasion.

The Burra Mine and associated activities like saving the old mine buildings get good coverage and sport, as usual, is quite well covered, but it is disappointing to find a number of other things are only referred to in the briefest terms in the ‘Out and About’ column.

Obituaries with any significant detail are rare and editorial comment on the changes occurring in the town is completely lacking.  Much of the news comes from beyond the town and immediate district and there is a lot of space devoted to articles of a generic nature; such as advice to primary producers.  Questions in Parliament are another significant input; usually with a clear right wing bias, which is unsurprising given the electorate.
