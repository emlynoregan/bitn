Land Allocation.  Also in Parliament Mr Bartlett asked on Wednesday how many acres had been allotted to Mr Warnes, a member of the NE Land Board, or to any of his relatives bearing the name Warnes. The answer was:

Block 63 Co. of Burra, east of Hd of King, 16,297 acres to Thomas W. Warnes.

Block 65 Co. of Burra, east of Hd of King, 26,775 acres to John Flower Warnes.

Both are sons of Mr Thomas Warnes.  The ex-commissioner of Crown Lands, Mr Howe, explained that as the Warnes were the only applicants under the personal residence conditions they obtained the land.
