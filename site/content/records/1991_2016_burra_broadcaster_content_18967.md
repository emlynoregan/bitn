The Main Street Committee failed to get enough attendance for its AGM.  It held what may be its last official meeting on 21 April, at which its officeholders decided to go on for the next four months while they await developments on a new structure to run the Burra Town Hall.

The Burra Regional Art Gallery is hosting the 1999 Quilt Exhibition.  Jenny Manning of Sydney, author of the soon-to-be-published Australian Quilt Directory, opened the exhibition on Friday night.  The 1828 quilt from Malowen Lowarth is a highlight of the exhibition.  President Karen Baum of Burra Quilters said the group had 35 members.  The exhibition runs until 30 May.  [Note that in the Issue 341, 17 December 1997, page 1

It is reported that the quilt has embroidered on it the inscription ‘AN to SN 1829’ – rather than 1828.]
