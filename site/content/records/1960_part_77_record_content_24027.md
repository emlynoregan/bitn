Burra Primary School Committee: Annual Report.  Chairman K.W. White.

Mr D. Zanker was elected Chairman in 1964 and served very actively until his transfer from the district.  Headmaster Mr Horsnell was transferred at the end of Term 1, to be succeeded by Mr I. Auhl.  Both headmasters have given strong support to the committee.  A picture evening with Gilbert Valley Camera Club in April raised Â£10-17-6.  Arbor Day was successfully held in July.  School Sports were keenly contested at the War Memorial Oval.  The Committee helped in completing the new cricket pitch and in getting power lines removed where they crossed the new area and water has now been laid on.  Entrance gates in the oval fence were fitted to allow direct access.  The proposed resurfacing of the tennis courts and provision of backstops is in abeyance.  The approach to the school has been made safer with the co-operation of the Town Council.
