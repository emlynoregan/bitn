Burra Community Library held its AGM.

Librarian Colin Fidock gave a comprehensive survey of the nine years of the Community Library’s existence.  Over this period the enrolment has been fairly steady at about 59.2% of the population of the district.  Statistics show that the library’s collection was well-used.  A video pilot scheme had been well received and should be budgeted for in the future (though no provision had been made for 1987-88).  Improved services had been made available for the Burra Hospital from 1985.  In 1986 the goal of providing a local history room had been achieved.  In 1986 more than 87 requests to do research in this collection had been made and in addition school students used the resource.  Shirley Thamm and Debbie Brown had continued their Burra Obituary Project.

Library Depots operated at Booborowie, Mt Bryan and Farrell Flat.  The library’s 8th birthday was highlighted with the publication of Relatively Speaking.  The Jubilee 150 year had been a busy one with a number of displays and the completion of the local history room.

Elected to the Board: Chairman, Sue Warnes; Vice-Chairman, Helen Stockman; Secretary, Betty Thamm and Treasurer, Tess Hopkins.
