Burra Golf Club

Early last year the western side of the golf course was closed for the greening program and at the end of last August the course was closed and the whole of the course was redesigned.  The old blacks were removed and the new greens formed and planted.  Darryl Venning, Club President, announced the new course would be officially opened on 16 May at 3 p.m.  He thanked the many people who had helped to make the transformation possible – some with heavy machinery plant and vehicles and other with stone picking, raking and smoothing the greens ready for seeding.  A former green-keeper from Eyre Peninsula played the course last week and said it was an amazing result.  The opening weekend will see three days of golf – a Stableford competition – men’s and ladies’ on Saturday, a mixed Ambrose on Sunday before the official opening and a mixed 4 BBB Stableford on Monday.
