A letter draws attention to the 90 minute time lapse between an emergency call and the police arrival following an accident when a car ran into the front fence at the home of an 86-year-old resident [Joyce Lloyd] in the early hours of Friday morning last.  The lady was frightened by the incident and offered no support and apparently later told she has to face the clean-up on her own.

[She will by 86 on 17 November.]

Page 3 does add that a 29-year-old male from Burra will face court in due course, charged with driving without due care.
