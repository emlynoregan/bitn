W.H. Martin, the retiring mail contractor of the Burra-Oakbank route, was farewelled at a gathering of some 30 people at Sturt Vale on Monday.  Mrs Greeves very capably managed the catering and a presentation was made of an inscribed gold watch with chain and a purse of sovereigns.  [The list of subscribers is printed.]
