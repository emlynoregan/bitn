Court.

There is a 1 column report of a case in which Albert Ludwig* was charged with stealing a rug from Charles Cassaretto of the Court House Hotel.  The evidence was rather confusing and the case was eventually dismissed.

* In the issue of 15 November page 4, the name is corrected to Albert Lutwich Hartwig.
