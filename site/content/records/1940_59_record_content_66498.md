Obituary.  J. Edgar Pearce died on Tuesday evening aged 75.  He had worked to within a day or so of his death.  He was born in Burra and educated at Burra School.  He lived here all his life except for a few years in his youth when he went to Mount Gambier and the West Coast, before returning to Burra to start his own business as a carpenter and builder.  He married Miss Maude Riggs on 8 June 1910.  His main hobby was rifle shooting.  He was a member of the club when it used muzzle-loading Martini-Henri rifles on the range at the cemetery flats.*  He was a foundation member of the present club when it started using the .303 rifle.  In over 30 yearsâ€™ association with the club he was on the committee and held all offices.  Some years ago he was made a life member.  He was also greatly interested in football and played for the Burra Club.  In later life he became a keen bowls player and won a Championship Trophy not so long ago.  He was also a member of the Town Council for two terms and a director of the Burra Electric Supply Co.  He was connected with the Methodist Church and a member of the choir for many years.  He was head steward of the cookery section of the Burra Show for as long as anyone can remember.  He leaves a wife, two brothers, Norman & Oswald and a sister, Nell, Mrs Archie Dearlove.

[*The new range came into use in 1901.]
