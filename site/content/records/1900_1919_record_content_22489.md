E.J. Harris has recently purchased the shop at the corner of Commercial St and Thames St, known as Fool’s Corner, and is turning it into a good general grocery store.  An entrance has been made through the division wall to give the grocer more display room and a large cellar has been excavated to store butter etc. in hot weather.
