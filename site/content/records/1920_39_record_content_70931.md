Cr Dow said it would have to be financed by an extra rate of c. 6d.  This would yield about £361.

The Mayor was less certain about savings than Cr Dow when the latter claimed present work costing £3 could be done for £1.

Cr McWaters was undecided.

Cr Dow said a truck would cost £334-£350 plus the cost of a spare tyre.

Cr Jeffery moved an amendment that a decision be left till all Councillors were present, but the motion was carried.

It was resolved to get a Ford.
