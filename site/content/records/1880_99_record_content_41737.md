Phonograph Story.  There is an interesting fictional story running for Â½ a column on the use of a phonograph in thwarting a breach of promise of marriage.  Interesting because at this date few readers would have seen or heard a phonograph.

Burra Show Society.  What has become of the Burra agricultural Soc.?

Kooringa Band of Hope continues to meet monthly.

Football at Burra Oval on Monday.  Clare 1.8 defeated Burra 0.1
