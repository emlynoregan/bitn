Leighton Hall annual dinner was held last Thursday.  It was a wet night, but attendance was still very good.  The hall president, I.J. Warnes, presided.  The Mayor of Burra, Mr Crewes, Captain Chaplain Nield and Signaller Harris were especially welcomed.  The speeches of course were dominated by the war and Captain Nield gave an address.  He spoke of the positive outcome of the war and the possibility it gave for the rebirth of the nations of Europe from the melting pot of war.  Mr Crewes thanked him for his vote of confidence and the hope which was sadly wanted.  He regretted that the war had seen the delay in the building of a Hanson-Booborowie railway.  Details of speeches etc. extend for c. 2Â½ columns.
