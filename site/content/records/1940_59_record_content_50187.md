Burra Burra Show Inc. adopted the recommendation to build the new sheep pavilion, but owing to the poor financial position of the society, it was deemed necessary to open a subscription list to try to cover the cost of the new building.  The proposed pavilion is 100 ft x 30 ft and will be built of wood and iron of new timber and with materials on hand used to build the pens.

104 pens are to be built, 5 ft x 4 ft enclosed with timber and cyclone.
