Mr Pascoe has received advice from Mr Walter Hawker of Anama (Central Bungaree) that he is forwarding a picture of that celebrated ram ‘Hercules’ which cost 1,700 guineas and also from Mr R. Reed of Kooringa, one of a flock of stud sheep, and when these are to hand this collection will be complete.  The photos which are uniformly framed and mounted range from 7’ x 4’2” to 2’ x 2½’, and were taken by Messrs C.P. Scott, W.B. Page, Edwards & Roach.
