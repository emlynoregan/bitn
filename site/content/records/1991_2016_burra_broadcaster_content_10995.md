A Saltbush Sheep seminar is to be held in Burra at the Civic Centre on Friday 13 September.  It will discuss the opportunities available to sheep graziers supplying sheep for the ‘Saltbush Dija’ market.  This is the trade name owned by Stephen Schmitz of Red & Beyond Ltd, who is providing marketing expertise on cuts of meat from saltbush grazed sheep for leading Australian restaurants.  An export market is also being developed.
