Oddfellows’ Sports organised by the local MUIOOF Lodge were held on 25 April at Stone Chimney Creek on land lent by Mr Herbert Morgan.  The Burra Brass Band attended and being to the east, the sun shone and all went well.  Results are printed.

[Personal interest: in the Boys 12-14 Wheelbarrow Race E. Fuss & M. Blott came 2nd.]
