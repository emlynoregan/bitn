The Variety Club of Australia will run this year’s SA Variety Club Bash in August.  It will start in Adelaide on 14 August and end in Clare on Sunday 21 August.  Burra will be represented by its own ‘Bash Boys’ in car 144: Richard Dollman, Craig Wissell, Andrew Nourse and ex-Burra boy Mick ‘Wally’ H—atz [illegible].

The event raises money for childhood cancer research and children’s charities, with 93 cents in the dollar going directly to assisting children in SA.  The boys will use a 1960 XK Falcon – repaired by Andrew and Neil at Burra Auto Repairs.  All cars must be pre-1966.  They require an entry fee of $5,000 and assistance in building the car.

The Variety Club aids Burra as well.  Last week they came to the assistance of Burra Community School Boarding House with a donation of $3,262 for a fridge, freezer, stove, etc.
