Burra Mine.  In answer to a question from Mr Quirke MP, Sir Thomas Playford said that because mineral rights had been alienated from the Crown in the area it was impossible to get organisations with sufficient capital to take on exploration due to uncertainty of tenure.  Amendments currently before the House of Assembly should facilitate investigations at Burra and similar places in some of the older mining areas of SA.
