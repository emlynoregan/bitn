[E.W. Crewes seems to have given tacit approval for a man, unnamed, to occupy one house there, being one room of two previously occupied by the late Mrs McGuiness.  The problem was that at present no one had authority to approve this as the solicitor was still drawing up the conditions etc.]

Stray cattle on Sundays remain a problem.  [The previous Inspector wouldnâ€™t work on Sundays, but the present one would if so directed.]

Cr Parks moved that the Inspector be paid extra if required to work on Sundays.
