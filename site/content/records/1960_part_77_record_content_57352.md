Rev. J.C. Jennison was the resident missionary on Taveuni in the 1890s to at least 1905.  Until 1900 the mission was based at Vuna on the southern end of Taveuni because it was furthest from the warlike chief of Somosomo.  In 1899 the church decided to relocate to the northern section and purchased the plantation named Niusawa.  This was a narrow strip only 17 chains wide, but extending up the mountain for about 3 miles, to give an area of over 400 acres.  Rev. Jennison and family moved into the previous home of the plantation owner in 1900.  It was in a very poor condition and close to the sea.  A new house was begun in 1901.  By February 1902 they had moved into the house while part was still under construction.  The house was 66 ft wide x 56 ft deep, with half a dozen rooms and a 10 ft 6 inch wide verandah.  So H.J.B. was not born at Niusawa, but spent some of his earliest years there.  The house has not been much changed despite some modifications in the 1930s.  The surroundings have, however, been transformed.  It is surrounded by the buildings of a large secondary school accommodating nearly 400 children from class 1 to Form 5 (equivalent of Leaving Standard).  Almost 150 secondary students live in the school hostel on the site.  The buildings are arranged around the playing field and the school serves a large area of Fiji.  Students are a mixture of Fijians and Indians as well as from the islands, with a few Chinese and part-Europeans.
