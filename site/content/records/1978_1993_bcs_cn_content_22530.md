Burra Community Sports Club Annual Report by Paul Wilson.

The year has been successful and the club has consolidated its financial position as well as making some improvements.  The dance floor has been improved.  Other additions are the lectern and pedestals.  The merino Capital of the World Night was a great success.  We would not be in the financial position we are without the great help of the Ladies Auxiliary.  The sheep project continues, but the rural depression has impacted on returns.
