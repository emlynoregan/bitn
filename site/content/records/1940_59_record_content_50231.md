Other items were given by Mary Cox, Marie Gare, Mrs Arthur Harris (Bessie Woollacott) and Mrs R.H. Campbell.

There was a session of reminiscences with a number of contributors:

Mrs J.G. Sara gave information about the second church building at Redruth, which was located just at the rear of the Courthouse.

Mrs Richard Reed said some of the stones from it are still to be seen there.

C.R. Woollacott recounted a beating for skipping school to rob a Murray Magpie’s nest and tearing his pants in the process.

Mr Rob. Fuss recalled being made to go to Sunday school twice every Sunday.

Someone told how Miss Bubb used to bring the girls from the Reformatory to Church.

Mr Jim Bentley spoke of the disciplinary measures of Mrs Brice and Mrs Chant, but also of their sincerity and service to the church.

Mrs Davidson told of her father leading the singing at services.

J.G. Sara recalled early men of the church, including Sir Frederick Holder, who had become an MP and later first Speaker in the House of Representatives.  He also spoke in praise of Mr Rabbich, whose memorial window was recently unveiled.
