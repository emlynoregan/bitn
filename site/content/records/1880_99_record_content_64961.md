Court.

Alfred John Jacka (17), Thomas Philip Halls (13), & Roy Douglas Alflick Henderson (13), all of Kooringa were charged by M-C Jemison with ill treating a ram at Victoria Park on Sunday 9 October.

F.J. Packard for Jacka who pleaded not guilty.  The others pleaded guilty.  Packard took exception to the way the information referred to Jacka as alias Fisher – he has never used the name Fisher, though his mother has married Mr Fisher – it would/could go against the boy later if it is said he used an assumed name.  His name was Alfred John, not Alfred James as on the charge.  After some discussion the alias was ordered struck out and the name corrected.

Jemison gave evidence that he had seen the three riding three rams at Victoria Park.  John Lewis said he went to the park and saw the three with Jemison and all three admitted riding the rams.  He had not personally seen them do so.  The boys’ clothing ‘was all over grease, especially Jacka’s.’

Mr Packard did his best over technicalities, but in the end Jacka was fined 10/- and the other two 5/- each with 5/- costs between the three. [1/8 each.]
