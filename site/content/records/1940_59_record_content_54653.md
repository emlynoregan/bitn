Koonoona Field Day.   A top price of 700 guineas was paid for a ram and J. Lindsay of Camara Stud, Winton, Queensland, paid 600 guineas, while two at 500 guineas and one at 300 guineas went to WA, among the good sales.  Although not an official Field Day, Roy Humphrys of ‘Blink Bonnie’ Proprietors showed several car loads of visitors some very good rams, to fill in some time at the weekend.
