Saturday 25 August

James Taylor, storekeeper, was accused by John Saunders of using offensive language to his wife, Eliza Saunders.  The offence occurred when he came to secure the release of his horse from the pound and was told the fee was 2/9½.

John Packham, employed by Mr Saunders, confirmed Eliza Saunder’s evidence.

Taylor was fined 5/- plus costs.
