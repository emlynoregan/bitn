Rhonda Teague, the local artist who won the recent Art of the Flower contest with her work ‘The Gathering,’ was invited by Greenhill Gallery owner Russell Starke to show seven of her works, with other Burra artists, at the exhibition at his gallery, which was opened by Premier Mike Rann on Australia Day.  Other Burra artists represented were Tanya Waters, Glenys Christopher, Harry Sherwin & photographer Rebecca Hackett. Rhonda sold one painting before it was hung and two others went to a buyer from Venice. [Photo of Rhonda and Russell Starke with ‘Poppies’
