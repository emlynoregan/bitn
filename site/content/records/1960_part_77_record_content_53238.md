Football.  North Eastern League Grand Finals

‘A’ Grade	Burra 13.13 defeated Booborowie 11.8

‘B’ Grade	Burra 7.8 defeated Clare North 6.7

Colts	Clare South 7.8 defeated Clare North 6.9

Junior Colts	Booborowie 11.7 defeated Burra 1.2

The Burra Football Club created a record by completing the season without a defeat.  Last year they almost achieved this, only to lose the Grand Final to Booborowie.  This is a Club record, but in the League Booborowie has won 28 matches straight, taking it beyond one season.
