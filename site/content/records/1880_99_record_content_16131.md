Cr Ridgway refused to repeat what he had said.

Cr Ridgway ‘moved Cr Sampson be made dictator of the Council and that all the others withdraw and leave the business in his hands.’

The Mayor said that was not in order.

The Mayor then suggested those who objected to the minutes state what correction they required so it could be made and business could proceed.

Cr Coglin then made the extraordinary statement that he objected ‘because he had last meeting opposed what was then carried’. 

The Mayor pointed out that if every Councillor refused to sign minutes unless he supported all that had been done minutes would never be passed at all.

Cr Coglin then said he would agree with the minutes.

The Mayor invited Cr Sampson to state the protest he wished inserted.  A protest was suggested, but ultimately Cr Sampson objected and the Mayor again put the motion and this time it was carried: Cr Sampson dissenting.

Council took notice of Cr Coglin’s intent to move that the Government be asked to gazette the town as a district under the Fire Brigade Act.

Cr Ridgway wanted sales of horses and horned cattle to be prohibited except in licensed premises to prevent their taking place in unsuitable places.  Deferred for consideration.
