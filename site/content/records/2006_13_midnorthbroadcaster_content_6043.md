Public Meeting of Ratepayers at Burra Town Hall last Thursday – chaired by Mark Parnell MLC (Greens).

The Council was represented by Mayor Peter Mattey and Crs Bradley, Gill, Mosey and Reilly.

Many speakers stressed their concern over the future of the town’s assets and the effect of changes on tourism.  Concern was greatest about Paxton Square Cottages and it became clear that there had been a lack of communication between the Council and the community on that issue.  The transparency of the way the Council was handling the Burra Caravan Park issues was also questioned by a number of people.  Mr Mattey was quick to answer many of the questions.  There was popular support for ongoing public consultation.

Helen Szuty considered it had been a constructive and productive night, though she was not confident that the community had really been heard.  The Mayor expressed disappointment that more of the younger members of the community had not attended.
