Burra Town Council, 2 July.

After the minutes were read North Ward Councillors asked for strangers to leave the room.

Cr West asked on what grounds, but no discussion was allowed.

Cr Sampson emphatically protested against general business being conducted in committee.  He could get no answer why the Council went into committee.
