Obituary.  Alex (Sid.) Ringberg died at the Burra Hospital on 26 April aged 30 [sic].  He was born at Pt Adelaide in May 1895 [and therefore 29].  He had been a scout since 1908 and later a scoutmaster of a troop at Pt Adelaide.  He enlisted in the Great War in the 30th Battalion in 1916 and was wounded and invalided home.  [Corrected next issue to 50th Battalion.]  He came to Booborowie two years ago as a harness maker and twelve months ago became postmaster.  He was a member of the Hall Committee, a librarian and a member of the School Committee.  He was a keen gymnast and formed an athletic club and was a member of the choir at the Catholic Church.  He was the principal support of his widowed mother and twin sister.  [Alexander Sydney Ringberg was born 12 May 1895 at Pt Adelaide.]
