Obituary.  The late Mrs O.A. Boulton died at Burra Hospital on 15 February.  She was born at Kapunda 80 years ago.  At the age of five she went to live at World’s End with her late father, Carl Pittman.  She married the late Archibald Boulton of Burra on 24 January 1896 and the couple moved to Burra.  On the death of her husband nine years ago she went to live with her youngest daughter, Mrs H. Parkes of Burra North and stayed there until she broke her hip, from which she did not recover.  She is survived by two daughters:  Mrs Hantken of Morphettville and Mrs Parkes of Burra North.  There are four grandsons, two granddaughters and six great-granddaughters.  One daughter, Mrs Chappell of Melbourne, died ten years ago.

[Born Olga Adelgunde Puttmann 30 January 1872 Spring Creek near Friedrichswalde (Tarnma since 1918): died Olga Adelgunda Boulton 15 February 1952 Burra, residence Burra North.]
