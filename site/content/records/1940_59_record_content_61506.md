Fire.  An extended blast on a train’s whistle on Friday alerted locals at Mt Bryan to the danger from a fire that had started behind the school.  It was soon extinguished, but not before threatening great damage as it swept the rear of the buildings in the main street and around B. & E. Olsen’s and John Beaglehole & Sons’ petrol depots.  Dieseline in 25 drums got hot enough to bubble, but a disaster was averted.
