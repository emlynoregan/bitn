The Muff Football Match (an annual event) was played on Wednesday in uncomfortably wet conditions.  The procession left from Commercial St at 3 p.m. headed by the Brass Band and went to the Hospital before going to Victoria Park.  Ramblers defeated Muffs.  The event raised Â£13 for the Burra Jubilee Benevolent Soc.
