Kooringa Primitive Methodist Chapel.  The second anniversary of this chapel was held on 25 & 26 July.  Morning and evening sermons were held by Rev. J. Standrin of Salisbury and in the afternoon the Bible Christian minister Rev. T. Hillman preached the sermon.  Despite very unpropitious weather, the church was filled for each service.  On Monday there was a sumptuous tea.  The weather continued bad with boisterous winds and heavy showers.  Between 300 and 400 people were fed despite the almost impassable roads through which those attending had literally to wade.  At the public meeting the costs of the church were reported for the year.

[The figures are indistinct and don’t appear to add up. The debt from last year on the chapel and ministers house seems to be £181-9-0, but would need to be £191-9-0 to reach the total cited: this year’s costs being; enlarging the chapel £286-18-0, lighting and cleaning £21-16-3, new lamp £1; for a total of £501-3-3.]

During the year they had collected £255-1-8, including £100 at the anniversary.  This left a debt of £244-12-7, which was considered very satisfactory.
