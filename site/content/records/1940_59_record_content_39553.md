Mrs Byrnes, who is staying with her sister, Mrs Wilcourt, at the Farrell Flat Hotel, has a panel of six prints that are creating considerable interest.  This set is the original one that the poet Adam Lindsay Gordon viewed before writing his masterpiece ‘The Feud’.  Gordon was an intimate friend of Father Tennyson Wood and Father Tennyson Wood was the great grandfather of Mrs Byrnes and the plates passed to her father and thus to her.  Only thirty copies of ‘The Feud: A Border Ballad’ were printed at Mt Gambier in 1864.  Gordon wrote the ballad after viewing a set of six plates illustrative of the old border ballad The Dowie Dens o’ Yarrow, engraved from pictures painted by Mr (afterwards Sir) Noel Paton for the Association for the Promotion of Fine Arts in Scotland and issued to that society’s subscribers.  The poem was reprinted in Literary Opinion in August 1891.
