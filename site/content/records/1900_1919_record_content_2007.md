The SAR.  The other night on the train between Hamley Bridge and Stockport two or three ne’er-do-wells accosted M-C Jemison and teased him endlessly on the assumption he was a ‘cocky’ and ended by becoming abusive and taking undue liberties.  Just before Riverton the officer telegraphed to M-C Queale and on arrival there the ringleader, named Thomas Hill, was arrested and next day fined £1 + costs.
