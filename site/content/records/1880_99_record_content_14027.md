Burra Town Council, 11 August.

The licence of A. Schutz as a [cab] driver was withdrawn.

Applications for Town Clerk were invited.

Agreement between the Mayor and Major Thurman will make it unnecessary for a by-law as to band playing on Sundays.

Messrs Symon, Bakewell & Symon advise the Council has no title to Aberdeen Reserve.  A committee of Council will interview the Secretary of the YPMA in reference to the matter.

Messrs Tiver & Preece offered £20 for a portion of Short St.  Council decided to accept not less than £50 plus the costs of the transfer.

The Mayor reported the arrival of Mr Jobson as resident engineer of the Waterworks.  There is a little difficulty getting control of the land needed for the reservoir and the shaft, but these being obtained the work would proceed at once.

The committee formed re the Aberdeen Reserve was authorised to negotiate for the land for the reservoir and shaft as well.

The Public Works Committee was authorised to arrange the necessary extension of the mains.
