Burra Races.  The club’s spring races were run last Wednesday.  It was one of the most enjoyable and most financially successful meetings since the end of the war, even though the weather was unkind.  Gate takings were close to last year’s record.  Bookmakers turned over the best ever sum of £38,700.  The best race for the day was the Burra LV Handicap for a stake of £115 plus a 30 guinea trophy.  The winner was Atheria, ridden by the young jockey W. Pyers and owned by Mr M. Flannagan.  The CWA provided an excellent luncheon.  [Other results are printed.]
