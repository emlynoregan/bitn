Tom Eustice of Boolgun [south of Waikerie] writes about the Stock Route Case.

He explains that they usually sell lambs and surplus sheep at off-shears sales each year.  This year they could not sell without loss and were left with 600 lambs and some young sheep and needed to feed them till the price rose at least to cover costs.  He travelled them on the stock road from Boolgun to World’s End Creek and back via Robertstown.  Feed was adequate and best in the Burra Burra District Council area, but water was a problem.  Between Florieton and Baldina Creek there was only one Government watering place at the new King Dam.  He tried to get a permit from the Lands Office in Adelaide for 800 sheep to travel to World’s End and back, but was advised to apply to the local Council for the area.  Thus he sent a letter to the Waikerie Council.  He asked the Chairman if he could obtain a permit from the Burra Burra District Council.  He pointed out the long distances between water and the need for recovery time.  The date cited in the Burra Record for the journey, 23rd-30th were not the dates for the journey, but the period of time within which he was to start the journey.  The problem was that his letter had not been dealt with promptly and the letter from the Waikerie Council to the Burra Burra Council had not asked for a permit.
