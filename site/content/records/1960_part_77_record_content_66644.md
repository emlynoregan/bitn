Tennis.  The Final report of the Aberdeen Tennis Club.

The club started about 50 years ago and at the end of the 1972-73 season has amalgamated with the Kooringa club to form the Burra Tennis Club.  The season began with a fresh coat of paint on the Clubhouse.  We fielded 2 ‘A’ teams, 3 ‘B’ teams and a junior team.  The White ‘A’ team were premiers.  The ‘B’ Purple team lost their final to Spalding and the Juniors also lost to Kooringa.  The Easter Tournament was again a success, as were fund-raising efforts throughout the year.  There was also a successful junior tournament.  We were sorry to farewell our President, Dennis O’Reilly, his wife Rona and family, at the end of the season, when they relocated to New Zealand.  We thank them for their hard work.  The season ended with a tea at the Aberdeen Football Club Rooms on 14 April.  During the season we paid the balance owing on the No. 5 court and so had five good courts to use.
