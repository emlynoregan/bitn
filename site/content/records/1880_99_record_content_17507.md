Martin

He was in favour of some protection.  Duties should be paid on things that could be produced here and if this raised too little then small duties might be imposed on other products.  Land tax should pay for Government borrowing for improvements in bridges, roads, railways etc. and for defence.  Property had in the past been insufficiently taxed.  Education should be free for reading, writing and arithmetic only, and for some technical education to fit people for work.  At present there was too much cramming for examinations.  There might be advanced schools for gifted children.  He favoured a continuation of grants-in-aid.
