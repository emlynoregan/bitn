John Sampson Jun., who had bought the Spalding mail run from Opie said that the price included four horses of which only two had been delivered in a reasonable time and when they were ultimately offered they were in such a bad condition that he would not take delivery of them.  Verdict for plaintiff Â£10 + costs.
