Obituary.  Miss Annie Ford, who was reputed to be Burra’s oldest resident, died in her Chapel Street residence on 11 July.  She was the youngest daughter of the late Mr & Mrs Joseph Ford of ‘Basin Farm’, Burra and was born 89 years ago on 6 April in the house now occupied by Mrs Jenkins in Ayers Street.  She was taken by her parents to live at ‘Basin Farm’ when aged two and lived there for 69 years, retiring to Burra when Mr A.C. Ford took over the farm.  In her young days she was active in the Bible Christian Church and was educated at Mr White’s Private School.  She was a generous supporter of various charities and especially of institutions caring for destitute children.  Until a few weeks ago she would still walk to visit friends at Burra North and even up the steep hill to Mr C.W. Gare’s residence there.  [SA Deaths CD registers this death as Annie Ford 18 July 1948 at Burra, aged 89.  Birth not traced in SA.]
