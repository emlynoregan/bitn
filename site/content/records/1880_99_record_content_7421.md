Apoinga Copper Mining Co., Prospectus runs across two columns.

There was a call for £30,000 in 60,000 shares of 10/- each.  The aim of the company was to acquire and work Mineral Lease 553 in the Hd Apoinga, 79 acres, c.10 miles from Kooringa.

A report from Thomas Anthony of Kurilla Mine is attached and also one from Thomas Cowling of Hamley Mine, Yorke’s Peninsula.  Both are very favourable.
