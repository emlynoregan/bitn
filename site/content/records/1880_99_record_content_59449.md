A Narrow Escape.  While the polo match was in progress on Saturday at Aberdeen a lad named Gully gave some of those assembled an exhibition of jumping and after clearing a ditch or two he tried to jump over a shaft, but ended up 20 feet down it.  A pair of reins was used to haul him up, after which he made a retreat homewards.
