Burra War Memorial

The Under Treasurer will not approve the Town Council’s request to borrow £1,200 to assist in building an oval at Victoria Park as a War Memorial, because the Council had already applied for a loan of £400 under the scheme.  This had been granted and the Council was still eligible for a loan of £400 under the scheme already outlined.  The Council could borrow £1,200 from the Savings Bank of SA if it so wished, at 3⅛%, but repayment would be the responsibility of the Council.

Thus the Council could only borrow £400 under the scheme, but it had a further £400 in bonds, which could be used for the purpose of building the oval – meaning it could make £800 available to the committee.    Further permission from the ratepayers to borrow the £400 will not be needed since the motion at the ratepayers’ meeting was to borrow ‘£1,200 or a lesser amount’.
