I wish to pay tribute to the role played by the Parents and Friends’ Association and the High School Council.  Both bodies have met regularly and done great work for the school.

[A list of individual thanks follows, along with a list of some of the actions and improvements that benefitted the school over the year.]

Only one change has been made in the staff.  Miss Hill has been transferred to Renmark, her home town.  Miss R. Blesing will replace her.

Dux of the School for 1948 Rex Anderson.

The Prize List is printed.
