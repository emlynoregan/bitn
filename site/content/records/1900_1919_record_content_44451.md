On 16 April 1845 the SA Mining Association came into being to develop the colony’s mineral wealth and prevent it all falling into the hands of one or two of the wealthy.

It issued shares to £5,000 in £5 shares with liberty to increase them to £20,000 worth.  Its aims were:

To purchase or sell mineral lands

To carry on mining operations when they were advisable

To let on royalty or otherwise

In response to an advertisement placed by the Secretary, H. Ayers, a shepherd named Stear produced a valuable copper specimen he said he had discovered on unsold wasteland to the north of Mr F.H. Dutton’s Princess Royal sheep run.  The part of the Burra Survey which comprises the Burra Burra Mines was not known to be metalliferous till a few weeks after Stear’s find when Thomas Picket, a bullock driver employed by William Robinson, then of Gum Creek, had his attention taken by an outcrop of red oxide of copper.  A special survey of 20,000 acres was made embracing the two finds and on 20 Sep. 1845 it was divided into two parts.  The northern moiety which turned out to be the really valuable one fell to SAMA.

Ten Cornish miners, a blacksmith and a Captain were sent north and arrived at Burra on 29 Sep. 1845.  They blasted out the red oxide and sent it back on the drays that had carried their supplies north.

After purchasing the freehold of the 10,000 acres SAMA had just £1,800 of working capital, but in the first seven months they made £20,000 profit and the ensuing eleven months produced a nett profit of £70,000.

For the 29½ years of the mine’s operation between 1845 and 30 Sep. 1877:

Ore produced 	234,648 tons

Realised nett.	£3,110,911

Cost of production	£2,284,325

Profit	£826,586

Wages	£1,400,988

The peak employment half year was to 31 March 1859 with an average 1,087 and a peak of 1,170.

The peak output was for the half year to 31 March 1851, of 12,966 tons.

And the peak half year for the sum realised was to 30 Sep. 1850, £127,410.

To the end of May 1867 dividends had been £315 per £5 share.

Official records show that in the six months to March 1849, 9,310 tons of ore was carted to Pt Adelaide over 100 miles of unmade roads by c. 600 teamsters, using between 6,000 and 7,000 bullocks.

A strike in 1848 held up operations for 6 months.  Before it ended arrangements were made for the Patent Copper Co. (Now the English & Australian Copper Co.) to smelt the ore and the first copper was produced there in the winter of 1849.

The establishment of the smelters made possible the handling of lower grade ore profitably.

The mine was at its peak of success at the end of 1851.

Gold discoveries in Victoria saw the suspension of all work below water level as men left for the goldfields.

Pumping ceased on 1 Oct. 1852 and it was not resumed till 4 January 1855.  It then took 17 days to fork the water at the 40 fathom level.

Work was resumed after the Governor, Sir H.E.F. Young induced the Emigration Commissioners to relax some of their more stringent regulations and allow Cornish miners to migrate to SA.  The low price of copper and the unprofitable working with high costs of open cutting led to closure in 1877.

For many years mining was limited to tributing, but in 1901 the present Burra Burra Copper Co. was formed to buy the mine and work it.  It bought everything except the interest of SAMA in the township blocks.
