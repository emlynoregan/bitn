Burra Hospital Nurses Quarters

The Burra Town Council deplores the refusal of a building permit for new Nurses’ Quarters at the Burra Hospital.  The Burra Hospital Board members took the opportunity of the Premier’s visit to Burra on Saturday to interview him with respect to this denial of a building permit.  The Premier pointed out that the Government cannot by law grant a subsidy to any hospital in excess of £4,000 in any one financial year and so the Hospital will receive the £5,000 subsidy in two payments; £1,000 this financial year and £4,000 in the next.
