Thomas Kitchen of Malvern Adelaide has suddenly disappeared, creating a sensation.  He is well known in Burra, having lived here for many years.  He worked first with Messrs Drew & Co. and subsequently for himself as a general dealer in Commercial St.  He was secretary for the IO of Rechabites, filled positions in the Wesleyan Church, was a local preacher, served a term as term as a town councillor.  About six years ago when he left Burra he was given an illuminated address.  He was appointed District Secretary of the Lodge in Adelaide where he seemed to give satisfaction.  A short time ago he was suspended and a special audit made.  He left home on Friday evening 28 January and posted a letter to his wife from Glenelg, saying when she received it he would be beyond reproach.  He has not been seen since and a warrant has been issued for his arrest.
