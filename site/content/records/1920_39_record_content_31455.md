Accident.  Lindsay Thomas, only son of Mrs H.H. Thomas of ‘The Pines’ had an amazing escape from death when his car was struck by the afternoon passenger train to the city at the Bon Accord crossing on Thursday afternoon.  Fortunately the iron guard rails broke, letting the car through.  It was dragged about a dozen yards, turning onto its side.  Mr Thomas escaped virtually unscathed.  The train was drawn by two engines and the leading one had to be taken off at the station.

[Rumour had it that he had been racing the train.]
