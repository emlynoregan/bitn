Burra Visitor Centre now has a new access ramp and steps to improve access to the building.  The ramp was built by local builder, Paul Wilson and replaces two large steps.  The ramp includes a non-slip surface and a sturdy handrail and the design closely matches existing crossovers in Market Square.  The cost is c. Â£36,500 ex GST.  The project will be completed when an automatic door is installed and that is expected this month.
