Local Government Voting

Recently the State Parliament has enacted the Local Government Act (Amendment Act) No. 73 – The Adult Franchise Bill, which affectively gives the vote at local government elections to all enrolled as an elector in the SA House of Assembly for the area.

Burra Burra DC

Up to six streets in Burra and Burra North will be sealed during March.

A $1,600 grant has been made to assist in repair of damage done to the Burra-Andrews Road in last October’s floods.

Council has agreed to relocate the old gun from the Mine Entrance to a point near their new complex at Burra North.

Vandalism at the swimming pool in the past month or so has caused great inconvenience and expense.

There is a move for parts of the Hundreds of Kingston and Ayers to secede from Burra and join the Hallett Council.  Council is most concerned about this and has asked in a circular that ratepayers think carefully about this subject.
