Sunday Closing.  Legal opinion is that a fresh poll is needed if the ratepayers of East & West Wards desire Sunday Closing.  Six years ago the poll in favour was taken when the Middle and South Wards were the arrangement.

The Council has decided not to bring the town under the Sparrow Act, as it would involve increasing taxation.
