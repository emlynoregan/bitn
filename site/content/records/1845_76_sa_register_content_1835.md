Burra Burra Mine; The Eighth Wonder of the World.

We have great pleasure in referring to our readers the half-yearly report of the Directors of the SA Mining Association as laid before shareholders last Wednesday in the company’s new offices in Rundle Street.  SA readers will not have to be reminded that three dividends have already been paid or that those three have amounted to 200% upon the subscribed capital of the company.  A fourth dividend is to be paid on or about 1 December this year.  This cannot but be a source of gratification to all in the colony, for all are benefiting by that prosperity.

The quantity of ore raised in the past six months has been more than double that of any other similar period, and also superior in quality.  The state of the mine promises long continuing prosperity.  The aggregate of deliveries at the Port in the last week of the report was 428 tons.  The sales of the last 917 tons reported from Swansea averaged £9-16-3 per ton.  There is every reason to expect a higher average as some of the ore has been sold for £32-10-0 per ton.

After repaying the original capital twice over, the clear surplus of property amounts to, at the lowest estimate, £104,694.

[The editor says that this is a gross underestimation of the true value of the assets.]
