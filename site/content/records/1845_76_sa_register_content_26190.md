Farming in the North

The rapid expansion of settlement in Northern Areas demands attention from more points of view than that of the mere tourist who describes in glowing terms the broad acres of smiling grain and the success of the efforts already made to bring these areas under cultivation.  The whole experiment is fraught with uncertainty, depending as it does on the vagaries of the season and on the manner in which the large tracts of land are taken up and utilized.  Will selectors work out the land by getting as much out of it as they possibly can, or will a better system be evolved with the improvements that may be possible with larger holdings?  It is to be hoped that the latter will be realized and that we do not see in ten or twelve years’ time a repetition of the migration which has been going on with respect to some of the earliest settled areas of the colony.  In some cases this is no doubt due to the smallness of the holdings as much as to the farmers’ improvidence. The new areas indeed offer some opportunities for a system of rational husbandry seldom achieved under the old system.  The use of fallow in alternate years and the running of sheep upon the fallows are being tried. We believe the benefits are great enough to justify our urging it upon the landowners.  This approach will preserve the land from exhaustion as well as providing work for labourers all year round.  [The benefits of the plan are then developed upon and the beneficial effects upon employment discussed and the growing of lucerne or artificial grasses is urged..]

More than one enterprising sheep farmer has entered upon wheat growing on a considerable scale, mainly in consequence of the enhanced sheep carrying capacity of the land after it has been broken up and cropped and then in the ensuing year sown with lucerne, rape or other fodder.

[The article goes into others details and believes that the two branches of farming should be combined to the advantage of the farmer; providing a less precarious living, preserving the productivity of the soil and increasing the prosperity of the colony.]
