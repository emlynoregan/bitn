Burra Uniting Church Op Shop keeps Margaret Alderson and her team busy on Mondays, sorting out the donations that arrive over the weekend.  There are four regulars assisting.  Profits from sales benefit the district as well as the Church.  Some of the income has gone to the Burra Hospital and some to BCS, while a wheelchair has been purchased for the Doctorâ€™s surgery.
