The Burra Hospital Petition is drawing widespread support.  It was drafted by members of the Ratepayers Action Group with the help of the Office of Greens MLC Mark Parnell.  Many hundreds of people have already signed the petition, which seeks a solution to problems caused by the withdrawal of the emergency service attending rights of Burra doctor Dharma Dissanayake.  While Country Health SA contends that emergency services are unchanged, with doctors attending from Clare as required, Dr Lakman Fernando disagrees.  He is Dr Dissanayakeâ€™s husband and also works part of the time at Burra.  He says there is confusion at the hospital over emergency procedures, with reluctance by the staff there to call the on-call Clare doctor.  He believes that the nurses at the hospital are acting as if there is no emergency service going on there.
