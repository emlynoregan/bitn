The Buffalo Lodge Ball was held in the Burra Town Hall last Friday.  About 300 people attended and c. £90 was taken at the door.  Mrs Preiss’s Five-Star Band played and D.H. Field was MC.  In 1951 profits were shared by the Burra Hospital and the Memorial Oval.  In 1952 the CWA Town Hall Improvements Fund benefited.  In 1953 profits also went to various outside projects, but this year the profits will benefit the Lodge’s own building fund.
