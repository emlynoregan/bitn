Burra on TV

On Thursday last a film crew from National Television recorded the historical sites of Burra.  Well known Sydney cameraman Mr John Kingsford-Smith (nephew of Sir Charles) was in charge.  He has been the cameraman for the National TV series ‘Australian Heritage’.  Mr Ian Auhl provided the local historical background notes.  Mr Arthur Hiles, Secretary of the National Trust in Adelaide, had negotiated the choice of Burra on behalf of the Burra District National Trust.  Although the final film will run for only about five minutes, a great deal will be packed into the period.  It was shot in colour so it would not become dated when colour TV is introduced in a few years.  Mr Kingsford Smith decided the outstanding feature of the town compared with other Australian historical sites was the masonry of its old buildings.  He said he was astonished that with its tourist features Burra was so little known, even in SA.  The film will be shown on 38 stations of the ABC from time to time and will help to put Burra on the tourist map.  It is hoped to have it ready for TV within a month.
