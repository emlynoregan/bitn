Burra Traders’ Association is unable to alter its constitution because it did not get an 80% response to its request to go ahead with a meeting on the matter, as required by its constitution.  Vice-President, Terry Wilson thought it a shame that the members were not even prepared to put the question to a vote yes or no.  For those interested in forming a tourism association, it seems they will have to start from scratch.  The National Trust is keen for such an independent body to be formed, because it would free the Trust to concentrate more fully on their key task of maintaining the sites they own in the town.
