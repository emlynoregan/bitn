With Morphett’s engine set up it could scarcely keep pace with the water.  Another engine was needed.  An excavation in solid ground was needed.  The engine house was erected, but the engine was never installed.  The shaft to raise the water was excavated and said to have cost £160 per fathom.  Why work stopped when it did was never revealed, just when they could have been made useful.  Some said the company was chicken-hearted.  They closed the mine and left it idle for a quarter of a century with a caretaker in charge.  Many expected it to start again with higher copper prices because well-defined fissure lodes had been encountered at the bottom levels, suggesting to mining men proof of its permanency as a mine.  Its closure seemed cruel to shareholders, miners and tradespeople in Kooringa and Redruth and it was also a shock to the Patent Copper Co.  [Actually to the English & Australian Copper Co.]  In full working order the mine employed 1,110 hands.  The surface men earned 21/- a week with 1/- withheld for the doctor and club.  The lived in the creek bank, which was then 10-12’ deeper than today from Aberdeen to the cemetery.  The prices of necessities were about as they were before the war except meat which was 1-1½ lb.  The miners supposedly got 30/- a week, but were generally paid by results, so much a fathom for tutwork, or on tribute at a % of value of ore raised.  If they cut a rich lode they could be very well paid.  There was nothing in the way of labour troubles so water was the only real difficulty.  The water could easily have been kept down had they kept Roach’s engine and used it with Morphett’s – but they sold it to Karkulta Mine.  They succumbed to a phase of hydrophobia.
