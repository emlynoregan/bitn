Mongolata Gold Field

Bylesâ€™ Mongolata GM

Report from W.M. Williams formerly underground manager of Bewick Moreing & Co. Lake View and Star Mine WA.

Inspection on four occasions since my first report last May convinces me the lodes will live to a great depth and that the field has a wonderful future.

At the greatest levels in the incline winze (at 420 ft), on which a crosscut has been driven through a well-defined lode 20 ft wide, samples were taken over 3 ft sections and assayed.  The highest value was 1 oz 14 dwt.  I advise sinking a shaft to work the mine, as I am convinced this lode will live to a great depth as well as length.  The property warrants more vigorous development with large and up-to-date plants.
