Councils are not permitted to donate to Patriotic Bodies says a ruling from the Local Government Assoc., as they are not covered by National Security Regulation 482 (1942), though this ruling does not seem to apply to appeals on behalf of servicemen or their dependents suffering hardship as a result of the 1914-18 war.
