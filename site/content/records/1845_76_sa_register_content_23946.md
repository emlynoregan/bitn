Easter at Burra.

Monday was dull and with drizzling rain.

The Wesleyan Sunday School Anniversary was held.  On the Sunday Mr James Scott of Adelaide preached.  The children’s singing was very good.  Some £30 was raised for Sunday school use.

The Church of England Sunday School pupils had a ride to Princess Royal where they were received by Mr McCulloch.

There was a Musical Entertainment one evening at which the Amateur Christy Minstrels delighted a crowded audience.  Over £10 was taken at the door.

On Good Friday the Wesleyans held a tea at Mt Bryan Flat to raise funds to build a chapel there.
