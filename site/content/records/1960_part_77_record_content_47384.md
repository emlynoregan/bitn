Burra Burra DC has adopted a new assessment with a total assessment value of $7,325, 130. In most cases the rating will be lower in the Town Ward than previously.  There has been a proposal to improve the Town Hall by adding toilet facilities and building administration offices on the vacant land adjoining the hall.  It has been found that the new Council, having eleven elected members and at least two officers with the Clerk and Overseer, meetings can build up to 15 members, which is greater than the present offices can accommodate.  Office staff are cramped for room and storage is inadequate.  [The rate for the Town Ward was 10c from a notice on page 6.]

New Sale Yards.  Oates Ltd is erecting new yards in tubular steel on land recently acquired on the by-pass road at Burra North.  Construction should be completed by A.J. Stock & Co. of Adelaide by the end of next week and the yards opened by R.J. Jeffery Chairman of the Burra Burra DC before the market opens on 5 September at 1 p.m.

C.T.K. Turner’s ‘Nariowie’ 12 miles south of Burra was passed in at $54.00 [per acre] when auctioned on 22 August.  It was later bought by P.F. & T.C. Ross of Emu Downs for an undisclosed sum.

Property in the Estate of E.T. Phillips was also passed in at auction and later bought by A.W. Arbon of Mundoora for an undisclosed sum.
