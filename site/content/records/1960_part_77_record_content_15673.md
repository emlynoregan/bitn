Mr E.A. (Curly) Wohling & Mrs Wohling are leaving Burra today after Mr Wohling has spent 64 years in the town, while Mrs Wohling was born here 73 years ago.  They will live with their son Ken and his wife Pat at Maylands.  Mr Wohling was born at She-Oak Log 80 years ago and was educated at Lindley (between Morgan and Florieton) and came to Burra at the age of 16 when he began to work on Redcliffe Station.  This was then owned by Messrs Scott & Son and from there he went to Braefoot owned by Mr Henry Scott.  After a spell of several years in Victoria he returned to Braefoot where a Mr Hill had taken over.  His work comprised shearing, farming, blacksmithing and sheep work etc.  His sporting interests included football, cricket and cycling.  Fifty-three years ago he married Miss Laura Lihou and they have lived in Burra ever since.  Mr Wohling commenced work as a barman at the Burra Hotel when Mr Carl Heinrich was the proprietor and has seen many changes there over 38 years.  When Mr Tom and Miss E.A. Scovell took over the Commercial Hotel Mr Wohling went there for 13 years before retiring.  Mr Wohling recalled riding against the cyclists Jack Richards (the first man to sell cars in Burra), Syd Grivell, Charlie Waldie [sic: Wardle?], ‘Pop’ Gardner, Albert & Bill Lomman (still riding), Harry & Oliver Baynes, Bill Bartel, Jim Bradley, J.D. ‘Duncan’ Kelly, Tommy Hogart and Alf & Albert McWaters.  His best distance was the half mile and most races were at Victoria Park.  He recalls playing football when Aberdeen and Kooringa played in snow and Aberdeen 0.5 defeated Kooringa 0.3.  When working at Woolgangi and Bungunya he would ride his bike into Burra on Saturday morning to play football and return on Sunday.
