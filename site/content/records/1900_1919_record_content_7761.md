Redruth Court, 29 April.

William John Richards, bicycle agent, and Edward Kavin Lynch, labourer of Mt Bryan, applied to have their bicycles returned from the police.  The cycles had been fraudulently obtained from them by a person for whose arrest, warrants had been issued, but who had not been found by police.  They were returned on condition the owners held them for six months in case they were required as evidence.
