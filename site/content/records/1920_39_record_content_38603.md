Citizens’ League

Though there are some 200 on the membership roll, there was only a moderate attendance to hear W.G. Hawkes explain the genesis of the movement last Thursday at the Institute.  The election of officers preceded the address: Chairman, T.H. Woollacott; Hon. Secretary, J. Fletcher; Committee, Messrs G.G. Hawkes, R.C. Sexton, H.J.B. Jennison, James Thomas & Miss Helen Wilkinson.

Mr Hawkes said the movement was a revolt against the party system to combat forces of disruption and chaos.  The first rally in the Adelaide Town Hall a few weeks ago drew a capacity crowd.  It was when the Scullin Government was at crisis point and repudiation was being considered.  Speakers referred to the need for Honour, Honesty & Loyalty.  That meeting was followed by the historic Lyons meeting in the Adelaide Exhibition Hall which was equally powerful.  E.D.A. Bagot who organised it was also behind the similar eastern states organisation ‘All for Australia Party’.  These meeting had undoubtedly been the cause for the calling of the Premiers’ Conference.  An emergency committee had been formed which practically was the merging of other parties to select candidates ready for any sudden emergency that may arise.  The Labor Party alone of major parties was not officially represented.  The Emergency Committee is presided over by A. Grenfell Price.  The Committee was not interfering, but merely applying itself to what may occur.  Much of the difficulties had arisen indirectly or directly from the Great War.  It had promoted legislation for social services and bounties and bonuses and a standard of living that could not be sustained.  The baby bonus for instance is an ill-devised scheme repugnant to common sense.  The old-age pension scheme has been and is being ruthlessly abused.  It induces old people of reasonable means to throw their money away and does away with the fine spirit and obligation of duty towards one’s parents.  It should be brought under a contributory system.  Even the soldiers’ pension, sacred to most of us has been and is being greatly abused.  Pensions to descendants of disabled soldiers can go on for 90 years and many who draw then are well provided for.  Arbitration Courts have not lessened strikes, but have contributed to industrial stagnation.  Prohibitive tariffs, bounties and bonuses have been resorted to by the Government and primary producers face the bill.  The sooner we return to some measure of freedom of contract the better.  Of the Labor Government it cannot be said they have been successful.  Payment of Members was another system that had been tried and found wanting.  He was however optimistic that the fulfilment of the Conference Plan will restore confidence.
