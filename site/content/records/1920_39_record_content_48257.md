‘Ratepayer’ writes about Mr Jennison’s candidacy for Mayor, again taking up the question of age.  Pitt was PM of England at 24.  In Australia Hon. S.M. Bruce was an outstanding political figure when no older than Cr Jennison.  Hon. C.A.S. Hawker was Minister of Commerce at 35.  Professor Melville at 28 was Economic Advisor to the Commonwealth Bank.  Dr Callaghan is Head of Roseworthy College at 27 and the Head of St Peter’s College is 31.  Cr Jennison has all the necessary qualities to fit him for the position of Mayor.
