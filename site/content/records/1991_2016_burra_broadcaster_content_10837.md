Council Merger Meeting

Monday night’s public meeting was poorly attended, prompting Council Chairman Graham Kellock to conclude that people must be satisfied with what the Council was doing.  He said that after much discussion the Council’s preferred option was to merge Burra Burra with Part of Hallett, Robertstown & Eudunda.  A Structured Reform Working Party from those four councils had been meeting since 4 June 1996 and had reported to the Local Government Boundary Reform Board.  In response to questions he said:

The Clare, Riverton and Saddleworth-Auburn option was not favoured either by that group or by Eudunda and Robertstown.

Cr Kellock had favoured one large group comprising both the optional groupings, but this had been opposed by Eudunda and Riverton.

The population for the council areas concerned was:

Eudunda	1362

Robertstown	812

Part Hallett	260

Burra Burra	1971	For a total of 4405

Clare	4200

Riverton	1643

Saddleworth-Auburn	2294	For a total of 8137

Burra already co-operated with Hallett, Eudunda & Robertstown on weed control and the Robertstown Council boundary was only 10 km from Burra.

On the other hand Burra and Clare Hospitals were linked and some Burra students went to Clare schools.

The proposed representation on a merged council would be:

Burra		5

Hallett		2

Eudunda		3

Robertstown	1

Harry Quinn thought that many Eudunda electors were unaware of their council’s activity concerning mergers and many of them favoured a merger with Morgan.

It was hoped to have the amalgamation in place by March 1997, in time for the next council elections.
