Letter from Juanita Queissner of Burra on her personal memories of an Aleppo Pine and referring to an article in the National Geographic Magazine of 2011 re the introduction of the pine into Australia by Lance Corporal Benjamin Smith and Sergeant McDowell in 1915 – survivors of WWI and quoting from the article: ‘Regardless of what species the Lone Pine was, its symbolic importance as a representation of our nation’s tenacity and fortitude remains.  LEST WE FORGET.’

[The article referred to was not in the National Geographic Magazine, but in the Australian Geographic No. 102 April-June 2011, by Aaron Smith.  The last sentence quoted was not capitalised in the original article.]
