Mokota Conservation Park

A management plan for the park has been released.  Located 15 km north of Burra, the park is the first reserve in SA to be acquired with the primary aim of protecting native grassland.  The plan aims to use grazing trials and fire to develop a regime to maximise biodiversity conservation.  The park contains more than 150 indigenous plant species, including 32 of conservation significance.
