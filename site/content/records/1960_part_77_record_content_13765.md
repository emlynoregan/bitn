From the school Lady Bastyan went to the CWA Room where she was net by the Mayoress Mrs Baulderstone.  Representatives of ladies’ organisations in the district attended.  The Governor meanwhile inspected the old Burra Mine area and afternoon tea followed at the Mayor’s Parlour.  The Governor’s visit to the RSL was brief, but he had the chance to meet representatives of the Burra, Farrell Flat, Booborowie and Hallett sub-branches.
