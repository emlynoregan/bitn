E.J. Davey, Inspector of the Local Board of Health, writes in response to Dr Steele.  He gives another side to the story and says that while Dr Steele’s account of the ward may be true the surroundings were another matter with a derelict garden and an obstructed path to the ward and precincts used to house fowls, turkeys and geese as well as about 30 cats.  It was evident that the state of affairs was the product of some time and having found the hospital insanitary it was his duty to serve a notice.  ‘I am entirely at a loss to understand Dr Steele’s attempt to excuse or palliate the disgraceful conditions.’

[Apparently E.J. Davey’s letter appeared in the Register on 1 September, as Dr Steele’s response cites that publication.]

Dr Steele writes that when Mr Davey was approached by members of the house-committee it was as a member of the Board and they wished to handle the matter quietly and tactfully, rather than have him act in his strictly official capacity.

Dr Steele reiterates his view that the condition was the result of an accident.  The rooms had been recently cleaned and indeed one was faultless.  No beds were made up and none was fouled by a cat – though clearly one had been slept on by a cat with muddy paws.  Clothes on the verandah had been cleaned and spread there to dry when the rain started.  Precincts were untidy, but not insanitary.

Local Board of Health, Monday

The Inspector upheld his view on the condition of the Isolation Ward.  Cr Collins said Dr Steele’s letter was uncalled for.  The Board thoroughly endorsed the report and actions of the Inspector.
