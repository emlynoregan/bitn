Floods.  Thunderstorms in the Booborowie area dumped heavy falls of rain locally.  187 points at Booborowie and 380 at the home of Jeffery Wedding.  Other people reported falls in excess of two inches.  Near the Booborowie cemetery the Big Creek ran a banker and 17 inches of water flooded the home of Dawn Taylor.

Mr Ron Dewhirst’s Austin Lancer stalled when wires got wet and was pushed to higher ground, but when he returned some time later it was found ‘hanging in a tree’, having been washed downstream in a flash flood.  Water entered the home of Lindsay McWaters.  Les Thomas reported 78 points at Mt Bryan East, but Burra recorded only 22.
