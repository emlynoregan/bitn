Morphett’s Enginehouse.  When it was restored in 1986 the large timbers supporting the upper floor and balconies had to be imported from Canada.  The Oregon beams were thought the best timbers for the purpose.  In twelve years they have split and show signs of rotting.  The two balconies are no longer accessible to the public.  Because of the importance of the building, the Council is seeking professional opinion on its repair.
