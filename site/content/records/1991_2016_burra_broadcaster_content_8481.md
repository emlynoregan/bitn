Adchem has received a safety award.

The award is the SA Bonus Scheme Level II Gold Award.

This is the highest level a non-exempt company (i.e. for companies subject to WorkCover premiums) can achieve.  The company achieved 131 days since the last lost time accident.  It has since extended this to 160 days.
