Jenkin does not blame the Burra School Board as they have answered the questions put to them honestly.  The place is within four miles and the Education Act forbids the opening of a school within four miles, but the Act was not intended to apply to townships. [Only to rural areas.]  Proof of this lies in the situation in the City, at Port Adelaide, or in the country at places like Wallaroo and Moonta etc.  The Copperhouse children cannot be compelled to go to the Burra School and yet are denied a school.

The present private school there cannot long continue.  If the man is competent he is forced to teach at a starvation rate of income and if he is not so much the worse for the children.
