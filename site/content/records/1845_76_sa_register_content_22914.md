Pastoral Outlooks in the North-Eastern areas are grim.  There is scarcely a bite of grass now, with summer still to come.  North of Kooringa the outlook is only slightly better.  Last year at this time a boiling down works at Wildoto operated for three or four months, but now the sheep are carrying too little fat to make this a viable option.  Butchers at Kooringa are selling hind quarters of mutton at 1/6 and sides at 2/6, but supply far exceeds demand.

Burra Mine.  The work of preparing for the new system and installing machinery is expected to start in five or six weeks on the arrival of Mr Swansborough.

Agriculture.  There has been no appreciable rain since June around Kooringa.  The grass is short and already yellowing.  Wheat crops so far remain green, but are very short.  If rain does not fall within two weeks many farmers will not recover seed wheat.  The days have been warm and dry, sometimes with unseasonably hot winds.
