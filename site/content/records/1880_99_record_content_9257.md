Obituary & Inquest into the death of George Williamson, a shepherd who died at the Burra hospital aged c. 52. [Probably on 14 January.]

He died soon after admission following a two week drinking binge at Winterbottom’s Hotel at Terowie.

Dr Brummitt examined the deceased and failed to find any serious injury.  He was suffering from delirium tremens.  Was called out at 5 a.m. to see him when he was in a state of coma and dying.  Post mortem showed a small wound on the lower back possibly caused by a kick or fall.  There was no evidence of internal injury.  Cause of death was probably delirium tremens.

Catherine Cameron - Matron of the Burra Hospital.  Deceased said he had been a shepherd at Hearn & Foot’s station Outalpa for two years.  He had come into Terowie and given Mr Winterbottom £40-11-0 and had lived on that for four weeks.  He gave his age as 52.
