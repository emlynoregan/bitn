Editorial on the Municipal Elections and the annual Ratepayers’ Meeting.

Candidates came forward at the last minute to cause a contest in each ward.  This is desirable.  We have before seen the evil of ‘party’ and the results of ‘clique rule’ and have no wish for more of it.  Rather we wish for true and fair representation of the people.

We are convinced from the Mayor’s report that affairs of the town in 1890 have been thoroughly attended to.  The year began with £77-16-6 in credit and after paying off £200 in bonds and £75 in coupons as well as doing public works to the value of £266-16-6 and meeting other necessary expenses the year seems likely to end c. £100 in credit.

In Public Health the Local Board began £50 in debit and this has been materially reduced.

The Parklands account had to pay a £100 bond and a £21 coupon and is now further in debt than at the start of the year, but next year should see a great improvement.

The cemetery account is £65 in credit, but the need soon to expand the grounds will require expenditure.

In the past two years the bonded debt has declined over £600.

The council has made a new assessment this year, which has seen a reduction of 16% in value.

Main Roads have been improved and the £300 Government grant there was well spent.

The Waterworks.  A year ago it was found that by altering the working as a result of the Council taking over the operation from the Government a credit of £105 resulted.  The rate was then reduced and this year by about 10/- per ratepayer and after paying working expenses and interest at 5% on the capital cost there is a credit balance of £255.  The town has been generally improved, with the money spent judiciously.

Accident.  A son of J. Harris, Bootmaker of Kooringa, fell down a cellar at the new building at the corner of Thames St a few days since and ‘received several nasty hurts’.  He is progressing satisfactorily.

Mr Stacey, who was here with Hans the Boatman Co., will return with a new combination to present Struck Oil.

An Art & Floral Exhibition will be held in the Institute 27 November in aid of Redruth Wesleyan Church.

Redruth Wesleyan Church repeated the service of song Nell on Sunday.  Rev. T.M. Rowe gave the connective readings.

Locusts are increasingly troublesome in the northeast and large swarms have even appeared in the town.  Much damage to crops is expected.

The Season.  Shearing is almost finished after the delays due to wet weather.  The hay harvest was most prolific and wheat yields promise to be high [subject to locust damage in places].

Obituary.  Mr James Nankivell died last Friday at his residence at Diprose’s Creek after nine years’ illness.  He was 39.  [Died 15 November 1890.]

Burra Teachers’ Association held its 24th meeting on 15 November at Burra.  Schools represented were Baldina, Burra, Clare, Copperhouse, Leighton, Mt Bryan, Saddleworth, Terowie, Thistlebeds, Tothill’s Belt & Ulooloo.  The President is R.S. McAloney (Terowie), the Vice-President is T. Nevin (Copperhouse) & A.W. Wittber (Burra) is the Secretary & Treasurer.
