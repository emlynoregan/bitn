Obituary.  Mrs George Kemble died 25 May.  She was born in Redruth Cornwall 1 May 1846 and came to Australia aged 18 in the Coalstream to join her grandparents.  She went first to Adelaide and then to Paratoo where she met George Kemble whom she later married.  He took up land at Douglas where they remained till Mr Kemble died and she came to Kooringa.  She was a keen supporter of the Douglas Primitive Methodist Church and of the Methodist Church after Union.  She had a family of nine children of whom six survive: Mrs Jane Woodman (Kooringa), Olive Mrs Weston (Kooringa), Edith Mrs Wilks (Kooringa), Mr W.G. Kemble (Baldina), Horace Kemble (Kooringa) & Edgar Kemble (Kooringa).  There are 23 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.  Her eldest son David died in 1928.  Mrs Burton-Roberts of Glenelg and Mrs Teague of Melbourne are sisters and Mr W. Burton of Adelaide is a brother.  [How a woman born Elizabeth Ann Jenkin has a brother called W. Burton is not readily discoverable, though brother-in law is probable.]
