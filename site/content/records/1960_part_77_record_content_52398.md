Burra Small Bore Rifle Club

The Department of the Army has inspected the Burra Small Bore Rifle Range and the position of the Housing Trust homes to be erected in Pritchard’s Paddock.  The Housing Trust has been able to give only 60 ft clearance from the butt and for safety reasons 80 yards is needed for the range to remain open.  The Army has declared the range closed for all shooting.  Negotiations are under way for a new site.

At the recent AGM Captain Mike Thomas made the report for the year.

Two new members moved away during the year: Bill White and Phillip Byles of the National Bank (transferred to the Adelaide branch).  This year Burra won the Williams Shield for the first time it has been competed for.  The club decided to accept the quote of J. Carpenter for cementing the top of the mound.  (The next step would be to erect a roof over the mound.) This work has been deferred pending a decision on whether firing can continue at the site as a result of housing being built on the south side.  The financial cost of moving would be substantial.  Special congratulations go to a new shooter Andrew Pearce, who has made rapid and sustained progress.
