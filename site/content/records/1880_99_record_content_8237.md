An Inquest was held on Tuesday last into a fire at the Burra Mines the previous night.  Dr Brummitt acted as coroner.

Ferdinand Gebhardt, (baker) - went into my yard c. 3.30 a.m. and on returning to the house saw a bright light in the sky and called my neighbour, Mr Head.  We went towards Prince’s Town and then via the other road to the station and near there could see that the fire was in the mine.  A good deal of timber was alight.  Mr West was aroused.  A fence adjoining Mr Davidson’s [sic] was on fire and we put it out.  We may have been ¾ hour getting to the fire.  [The name is actually Davison - see below.]

George Head gave similar evidence.  They had first thought the fire was at Dew’s place at Prince’s Town

The prime source of the fire had been a shed, which was totally destroyed.  Dennis Hayes, a drover, had stored a trap in the shed, but he could cast no light on how the fire might have started.

James Bentley Davison. The shed adjoined my house and contained traps, harnesses etc. to the value of c. £110.  It was built of wood with a shingle roof.

Jacob Burrows, watchman at the Burra Mines could add nothing relevant.

There was an open verdict.
