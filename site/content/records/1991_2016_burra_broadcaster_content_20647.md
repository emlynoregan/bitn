Burra Cemetery

Goyder Council in conjunction with the Burra Cemetery Committee and the Heritage Advisory Committee will prepare a plan for the future development and management of the Burra Cemetery.

The older section of the cemetery is well defined by its stone wall, but the two committees felt the new section was ill defined.  Also, poor drainage in the new section has been impacting on the stone wall.  A plan for the future would address drainage, boundary fencing and landscaping.  The future expansion of the cemetery also needed to be addressed.  If new land has to be acquired trees should be planted around the perimeter to delineate the area before it starts being used.
