A Review of 1995

Council Mergers

Burra Burra DC could merge with up to six councils according to a report to State Parliament.

The Council has made it known that it is not in favour of forced amalgamations.

Wildlife Disease

An epidemic of blindness in kangaroos showed up in areas near Burra in April.

The Calici virus outbreak in rabbits made headlines later in the year.

Royal Adelaide Show

Local Merino studs did well.

Ashby’s Old Ashrose won five first places and nine other prizes.

BCS gained several minor placings in the Led Steer section.
