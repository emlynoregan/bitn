This week Apex handed over a cheque for $1,600 as a major contribution to the purchase of a new electronic typewriter, which has been in use for a number of weeks and is greatly appreciated by the typing ladies with its memory bank.  Apex applied for and won a grant of $1,200 through the Local Government Assistance Scheme and raised $400 to add to it.  The Lions Club will contribute $200.

[Note: as forerunners of the personal computer, these typewriters had memories that provided some of the word processing capabilities of computers.]
