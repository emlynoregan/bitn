Advt.  Sara & Co. offer a grand sale of goods slightly affected by smoke, but every article is guaranteed sound.  All are discounted 25%.  £1,000 worth of groceries, hardware, china, glass, fancy goods, patent medicines and hardware items must go.

Cash only.  No Delivery.  Be Early Thursday Morning

[Another small advertisement on page 2 says they were giving away unsaleable, but sound goods to ‘needful deserving folk’.]
