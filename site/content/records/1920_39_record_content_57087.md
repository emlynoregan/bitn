Obituary.  Mr Henry Winter Lihou died at Pt Pirie on Thursday night.  He was 80 and had been living with his son Mr A.W. Lihou, on Three Chain Road.  His health has been failing for about two years.  He was born at Salisbury in 1854.  As a young man he was a miner at Burra, a dam-sinker in the Far North and a teamster in the rougher parts of the state.  He lived in many places including Burra, Kapunda, Terowie and Peterborough before moving to Pt Pirie in 1900.  He worked on the top floor of the smelters for many years.  Seventeen years ago his wife died and since then he has done little work, living mainly in peaceful retirement.  He was the first man to take a load of cordials to Terowie.  He leaves behind as a curio a florin representing the first wages he earned.  Years later he had it made into a brooch for his wife.  He never completely recovered from an accident in a sulky six years ago.  Seven children survive, four daughters and three sons:

Mrs J. Allen of Burra

Mrs F.J. McMahon of Solomontown

Mrs L.E. Alderson of Solomontown

Mrs W. Higgins of Solomontown

Arthur & Hurtle (twins) of Solomontown

Stanley of Brighton

There are 23 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.

One sister, Mrs Alice Birt of WA, also survives.

[Born 8 November 1854 Cox’s Creek: died 18 July 1935 Pt Pirie.  H.W. Lihou was also a butcher and had a partnership in Burra with Mr. Bromley, which was dissolved 12 April 1878.   His father, Nicholas Lihou had an aerated waters and cordial factory in Queen St, Burra for several years before going out of business in 1881.  He operated it with several of his sons.]
