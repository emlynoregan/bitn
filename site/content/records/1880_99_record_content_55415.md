Obituary.  The Rev. R.M. Hunter died at Kent Town last Thursday aged 55 from a brain tumour.  He was in charge of the Kooringa Wesleyan Circuit for three years.  Robert Morris Hunter was born 13 December 1839 at Edinburgh and was an only child who was orphaned at 12.  He then was taken to sea by his uncle Captain Neil McEachern of the Royal George.  He sailed round the world twice.  About 1855 McEachern went into business in Melbourne taking Robert with him.  Subsequently Mr Hunter worked in several Melbourne merchant houses and became a lay preacher at Scotch Church, St Kilda.  In Scotland he had been close to Rev. James Morrison, the famous Scottish Armenian.  In Melbourne he became a loyal Methodist.  Mr Hunter’s first station in SA was at Brompton.  In 1881 he went to Moonta and in 1884 was appointed Superintendent of the Pirie St Circuit and in 1887 to the Kent Town Circuit.  He came to Burra in 1890 and in 1893 transferred to Archer St North Adelaide.  After only one year he went to Broken Hill.  His body was brought to Burra for burial as it was while here that he lost his first wife and a son and his wish was to be laid in the same ground.  [Died 29 November 1894.]
