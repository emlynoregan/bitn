Resident Magistrate’s Court, Kooringa, 21 January.

John White was fined 10/- with 24/- costs for having used abusive language to Mary Ann Ellis on 19 January.  Having been robbed of £3, he came to her hut and accused her of taking it, used certain scandalous expressions towards her daughter and called the complainant a [bloody whore].

Thomas Harris alias Swankey Tom was fined 0/- with 16/- costs [presumably the 0/- is a misprint; possibly for 10/-?] for assaulting Thomas Harris at Ware’s Hotel on 18 January.  He pleaded guilty.

Lewis Sims was fined 5/- plus 11/- costs for assaulting David Hughes on 22 November.  He pleaded guilty, but argued extreme provocation, as Hughes had used the most abusive language towards him.
