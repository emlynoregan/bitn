Burra Bowling Associates AGM elected: President, Rube Phillips; Vice-Presidents, Dulc. Crump & Dorothy Kellock; Secretary, Dorrie Pietsch & Treasurer, D. Crump.

For the past year £200 was donated to the men’s club and £62 in membership fees.  The Associates were currently £115 in credit.  The group catered for the Easter tournament, the Mid-North Champion of Champions and a visit of RSABA delegates.

Club Champion was Pat Field, who also won the Consistency Trophy.

The Handicap Singles trophy went to Estelle Mitchell and the Pairs winners were Dorothy Kellock and V. Allen.

The season ended with a very enjoyable dinner at the Burra Hotel.
