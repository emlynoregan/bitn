The Mayor thought a high assessment and a low rate was poor policy.

Cr Woollacott [in apparent contradiction of his earlier stance] said he believed in a correct assessment.  House values had dropped 40% and the assessment was 4 years old.

The Town Clerk said the assessment was on rental and not capital values.

Cr Woollacott then moved that the assessment be rewritten with a 20% all round drop.

The Mayor said that Corporations were not allowed to do that.

Cr Pearce moved that the matter be given some thought and a decision be postponed to the next meeting and that amendment was finally carried.
