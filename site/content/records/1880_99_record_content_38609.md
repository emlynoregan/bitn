Alfred Davey was farewelled on Saturday evening last at John Snell’s Temperance Hotel by members of the Bible Christian Church.  He is leaving the town for Adelaide.  For the last three years he has been employed at the Record office and has been organist at the Bible Christian Church for many years as well as being long connected with the Burra Brass Band.  The Church presented him with a handsome silver lever watch and Jos. Davey presented him with a chain of Broken Hill silver on behalf of the band.
