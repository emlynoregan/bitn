Burra’s Big Weekend of Rock Music was a huge success.  Over 40 participants took part in the instrumental workshops and on Saturday night the town rocked till late as local band Stone Crows and Billy and the Redfins performed to an appreciative audience.  On Sunday the participants fronted up for a talk on financial management and after lunch they put on a concert involving 11 guitarists, 4 drummers, 3 key-board players, a harpist and 2 saxophonists.  The feedback on the event has been very positive.  The proceeds from the bar will aid the Variety Club.
