LCL Burra Men’s Branch held its AGM 27 July.

A.D. McDonald as President was in the chair.  He reported a disappointing year, finding difficulty in sustaining the enthusiasm of members or attendance at meetings.  Funds were short and the secretary had to stand out of his salary.  Rent on the meeting room had not been paid.  Mr McDonald was re-elected as President, despite his clear reluctance – he would have liked to see a local person take on the role.  Vice-Presidents were S.H. Robinson & G.G. Hawkes.
