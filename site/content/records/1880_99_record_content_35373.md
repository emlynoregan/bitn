Letter from ‘Another Ratepayer’ in support of the appeal against the rate assessment by W.R. Ridgway.  He says that at present Burra property is unsaleable and rents much decreased in value.  There are empty shops and houses throughout the town and yet ‘Ratepayer’ seems to think the assessment values should be as they were when the Mine operated and put each month some £3,000 into the town.  For 12 years businesses have steadily gone from bad to worse, so of course people are protesting and Mr West has certainly known the place for over 32 years.
