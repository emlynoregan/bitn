The Old Burra Post & Telegraph Office was sold at auction last Wednesday.  A crowd of about 50 was present when Brock Partnersâ€™ auctioneer offered the 140-year-old property.  Bidding started at $70,000 and rose to $132,000 at which point it was knocked down to the Burra Burra DC.

[It would be more accurate to describe it as an 82-year-old building, since little of the original structure survived the rebuilding of 1911.]
