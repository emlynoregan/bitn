Burra Community Management Committee was set up three years ago to liaise between the community and the council.  It has dealt with issues such as: Burra Creek restoration, management of Paxton Square Cottages, the establishment of an industrial site, garbage disposal and Market Square lighting.  It will be involved in the 2012 John McDouall Stuart sesquicentenary.  A number of positions on the committee will come up for election at the AGM in the Burra Town Hall supper room 9 August at 7.30 p.m.
