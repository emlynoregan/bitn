Burra Show Society.  The general committee met on last Friday with President I.J. Warnes in the chair.  The Ring Committee recommended that the Dog Trials be on 1, 2 & 3 September with a sheep show on the 2 September and the General Show in October.

The Produce Committee wanted the three shows together in the second week in September.  Mr Warnes said last year the General show was on 6 October to suit sheep people, but that was too late.  After discussion it was resolved to take the Ring Committeeâ€™s suggestion on Dog Trials with the Sheep show on the second day of the Dog Trials.  Mr Radford moved that the General Show be the first week in October, but this was amended to the fourth Wednesday.
