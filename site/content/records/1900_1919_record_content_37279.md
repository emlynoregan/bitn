Car Accident.  On Friday Charlie Ewins, son of W.J.C. Ewins and Harry Truscott, son of W.T. Truscott were taking an unauthorised ride on the step of Hallâ€™s cab.  On being discovered they jumped off into the path of a car driven by Mr G. Thorpe.  Both were struck, but fortunately the car was not doing more than 10 m.p.h. and the brakes were applied as soon as the boys jumped.  Charlie was actually run over and much bruised and internal injuries were feared, but he is doing well.  Henry sustained shock and a splintered fracture of the thigh.  He is doing as well as can be expected.
