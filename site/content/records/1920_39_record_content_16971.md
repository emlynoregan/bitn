Miners’ Dugouts.  Much interest is being taken in the opening of two old huts in the creek on the property of Mr Charles Grow of Kooringa.  They were miners’ homes some 80 years ago and Mr Grow has been persuaded to open them to visitors to the ‘Back to Burra’.  The old fire places and earth walls still have whitewash attached.  Scores of locals are visiting them.
