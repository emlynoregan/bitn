Letter.  ‘The Man Who Sees’ writes commenting on recent Council actions.  The gist of the letter is:

Though Council says it has not discussed Paxton Square’s sub-standard housing, alterations are being made, though whther to regulations or to a definite plan is unclear.  What is known is that several Rodent families have been disturbed and as a result have taken a liking to the tenants’ best rooms.  Perhaps they have been attracted by the contractors’ materials left there.

Later it is said that following the recommendations of a Central Health Inspector the Council recommends that business places install septic tanks systems as a priority, though whysuch a place would have a higher priority that a large family dwelling is a puzzle.

A third thing reported was that there were a few sub-standard dwellings that should await Housing Commission authority before they were condemned.  The word few seems odd, given that the Inspector’s report of some time ago said Burra had more such houses than any other district visited of the same size.  There is a serious need for a District Nurse or some one or a group who can visit homes to find out the needs of those in dire need of a helping hand.

Something needs to be done to ease the burdened citizens who need all the help they can get to make life worth living.
