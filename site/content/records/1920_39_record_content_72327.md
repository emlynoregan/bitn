Burra Bowling Club AGM was held at the Commercial Hotel 6 September.  During the year two very enthusiastic members died in Max Pearce and John Weston.  Financially the year began in credit £37-18-4 and ended in credit £1-11-2 due to some non-recurrent costs.  [Details are given.]

Membership has continued to decline and with it income:	1932-33	£95-11-0

1933-34	£89-5-0

1934-35	£81-5-0

1935-36	£80-9-0

1936-37	£83-15-0

1937-38	£75-11-6

There are now 29 members plus 2 night and 2 Sunday members, but prospects are good for 6 new members.

This season the club won the Burra-Kapunda Cup and the Burra-Clare Shield.  It won five of the eight games played against other clubs.

Elected were Patron, Dr D.M. Steele; President, F.T. Sara; Vice-Presidents, G.E. Dane & S. Kellaway and Hon. Secretary & Treasurer, J.T. Pascoe.
