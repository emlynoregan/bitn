Obituary.  Frank Pearce, eldest son of John Pearce, contractor of Kooringa, was found dead yesterday morning in the old Bible Christian Church with part of his head blown away.  It is believed he committed suicide between 7 & 8 a.m. having left his nearby home, seemingly to go to the Kooringa post office where the firm has the contract for renovations.  When he failed to arrive there a search was made between 10.30 and 11.30 and his father found the body lying on top of a rifle.  (He was a member of the Burra Defence Rifle Club.)  It is assumed worry over work matters caused the rash act.  He was aged 33 and leaves a wife and two small children.
