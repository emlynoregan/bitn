Redruth Methodist Church, Sunday evening last.  It was noted, not for the first time, that a man of German descent in business in Aberdeen, was not singing the National Anthem.  A father of a boy killed in action signalled him to do so and he refused.  He was then knocked lengthwise into the aisle and forcibly ejected from the church.  He has since written an apology and promised to sing it in future at church.  [The man was E.E. Thamm.]
