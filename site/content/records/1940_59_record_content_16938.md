Burra Institute.  At a meeting of Town Council on 20 March the Mayor suggested that if Council did take over the Institute the building be turned into a Memorial Hall.  He suggested the Institute Committee and Council (with the permission of the ratepayers) have drawn up by Mr Bednall, solicitor, conditions for a negotiated sale.  Then the matter of interviewing the Institute Association, Minister and Municipal Assoc. be left to Mr Bednall.  If the matter proceeded in the right spirit and the Institute became a memorial Hall, he was sure the public would stand behind it and the debt would be paid off.

Cr Kellaway asked about costs (which the Mayor said would not be great) and said there would need to be a ratepayersâ€™ poll.

The Mayor said the matter had been around since about 1934 and in 1941 the Council had agreed, but the deal fell through over petty obstacles raised in the Institute Committee.  The matter will be fully discussed at the next Council meeting.
