Burra Literary Society held its first meeting for its second season.  The society was inaugurated on 5 April 1889 and worked through until 13 December before going into summer recess.  There was an average attendance of 37 at 34 meetings.  An outline of what they did is printed in some detail.  Finances had come from membership fees and two entertainments - one of local talent assisted by society members and one organised by Mr Roach using Adelaide talent.  He bore all the costs and handed over the takings to the piano fund.  Accommodation has been provided for the society by Mrs Reed of the Temperance Hotel.  They look forward to her hospitality again this year.
