Dipping of Headlights

Motorists are reminded that from late 1940 it became compulsory to dip headlights in order to avoid dazzling oncoming drivers.  All new vehicles registered after 31 December 1940 must be fitted with a dipping apparatus.  All vehicles not fitted with a dipping apparatus must have the beam of light from their headlights permanently dipped, i.e. the main beam of light must not exceed a height of three feet six inches at a distance of 75 feet or more from the vehicle.
