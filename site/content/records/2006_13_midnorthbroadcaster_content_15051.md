The Norwood Cycling Club’s 92nd Burra Classic is on this Saturday, 4 august.  It was first run in 1907 and this event is supported by the Regional Council of Goyder, Torrens Engineering, Domain Business Finance and SA Gas Haulage.  Local businesses are offering the Burra Sponsors Trophy for the best placed sponsored rider.  The race leaves from the Burra Town Hall and goes to Mt Bryan, returns to Burra and then goes to Robertstown and back to the Burra Town Hall for a total of 125 km.  On Sunday riders will compete in the Peter Reilly Handicap for masters and women riders.  Peter, who died in 2010, was a Burra resident and long time supporter of the annual race.
