In September we lost the services of Miss Davidson due to ill health.  In the last term Miss McMinn came to assist.  Attendance has, on the whole, been good.  The dux for the year 1907 is Clara Bartholomaeus, who gets the Rector’s prize for scripture and Mr Roach’s for Arithmetic.  Joy Sangster comes second with Mary Sandland almost equally successful.  Joy gets her father’s prize for Composition and Mary my prize for diligence and progress.  Vera McBride gets the prize for best manual work.  Doris Drew is best junior.  [Other prizewinners are listed.]
