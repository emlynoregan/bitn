Letter.  John G. Monfries, Secretary of Burra & District Residents & Ratepayers’ Association.

Is relieved to finally receive some advice from the Burra Burra DC about the reform of councils in SA.

Wished to make the following points about council amalgamation:

There has been no open debate between the proponents of amalgamation and the community.

This means the community has not been made aware of any disadvantages.

The community has not been given the opportunity to express their wishes for or against amalgamation or in respect of the proposed partners in proposed amalgamation.

The Memorandum of Understanding was entered into without community consultation.

The community has not been advised of any possible savings or other long term benefits.

Will local government remain ‘local’ and can we be assured there will be no loss of local democracy?

We believe some form of open forum is needed.
