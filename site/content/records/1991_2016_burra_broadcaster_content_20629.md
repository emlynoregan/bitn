Two Petitions have now been presented to Goyder Council, one from residents wishing to see the Burra Heavy Vehicles Detour sealed as quickly as possible and the other from Burra Traders Association calling for the Kooringa Road to be sealed before the Detour.  Council will continue to lobby for funding and requesting the State Government to take responsibility for the upgrading and maintenance of the Detour as a matter of urgency.  Council also resolved that sealing of Kooringa road was not high on its priorities at present.
