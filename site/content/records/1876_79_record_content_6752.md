Entertainment. The entertainment by the Amateur Dramatic Society [Co.?] is reviewed. The music would seem to have been competent, though the larrikins at the back of the hall were as annoying as usual. The scene from `The Rivals' was better not spoken of and the farce `D' ye Know me Now?' was well done, but not worth doing, being utterly unworthy of the time expended on it.
