Editorial on The Elections.

As well as electing two MPs the voters will be asked to vote for or against adult suffrage for the Legislative Council and to decide on the Commonwealth Bill.  At present the qualifications for the Legislative Council vote requires electors to hold a property of rental value of at least £25 p.a. and this yields some 37,000 voters compared with 80,000 who do not hold property to that value.  The proposal is to make eligible all who are eligible for the House of Assembly.  SA will not be materially affected by the amended Commonwealth proposal.
