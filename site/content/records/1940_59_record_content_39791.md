Country Quiz

Glen Finch (21), son of Mr & Mrs Glen Finch of Burra, collected about £60 worth of prizes when he won the Zone Final for ‘Country Quiz’ in Burra Town Hall on Friday night.  The quiz was conducted before a large audience by The Macquarie Broadcasting Corporation of Sydney.  It is being conducted across Australia and Burra was chosen as the place for the finals of this particular zone.  Mr Finch chose a Crystal Water Set for winning the Burra Contest and a Five valve Duel Wave Battery Operated Wireless Set for winning the Final.  The recorded programs will be heard over 5DN during January.
