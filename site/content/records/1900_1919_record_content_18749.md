Obituary.  Mr James Wheller of Farrell’s Flat died after a long and painful illness.  He was a friend to everybody and many a person has had much to thank him for.  He was born at Watervale in 1849 and lived there with his parents for some time.  He married his present wife in 1875 at Mintaro Church and then moved to Tarlee where he carried on business as a blacksmith for a number of years before moving to Farrell’s Flat where he has been a blacksmith and general dealer for 16 years.  He took a great and active interest in town and district affairs and was an energetic Councillor for a number of years.  He was a staunch Methodist and an enthusiastic worker for the Farrell’s Flat Methodist Church.  That the church is comfortable, well maintained and free of debt owes much to the work and liberality of Mr Wheller and his family.  A few months ago he contracted cancer and has been largely confined to his bed for some time.  He died on Saturday evening 8 December and was buried in Mintaro Cemetery.  He is survived by a widow, three sons and two daughters: E. Wheller (Farrell’s Flat), Rev. Harold Wheller (studying for the ministry in Brisbane), Norman Wheller (Farrell’s Flat), Mrs W.T. Venning (Adelaide) and Lily Wheller (Farrell’s Flat).  There are several grandchildren.  [James Emanuel Wheller died 8 December 1906.  Registration records say he married Mary Jane Gullidge 15 September 1875 in a house at Mintaro.]
