Burra & District Ambulance Committee met on 22 May.  In the past 12 months Membersâ€™ subscriptions have fallen by $90.  Membership subscription is $2 or $1 for pensioners.  This gives free coverage for the district and for a trip to Adelaide a fare reduction of 50%.  Non-members pay $2 flagfall and 25 cents per mile.  Distance is calculated both ways, so a trip to Adelaide will cost a non-member at least $54.
