Editorial on Industrial land in Burra.

Past Councils have been lethargic in obtaining a constructive outcome in regards to an industrial zone for Burra and their consultants have been remarkably slack.  The Council had asked for ideas on revising the then Supplementary Development Plan, but apparently have not had a single response in writing.  The danger is that if no responses come in by the end of the month nothing will change.
