Burra Quilters Group is pictured at last week’s workshop at the Burra Bowling Club with special guest and tutor Lorraine Cocker.  The next major project for the club is the preparation of quilts that will be raffled prior to and during the exhibition that is to be held at the Art Gallery next May.  Part proceeds will aid the Clare Zonta Club for the preparation of birthing kits for women in third world countries.
