Burra Pre-School Kindergarten

Moves are being made to open this on 5 February at St Mary’s Hall.  Arrangements have been made with Mr E. Lehmann to collect students at two points at either end of the town.  An advertisement is out for a girl who would like to train as a Kindergarten Assistant.  Subscriptions so far are £16-9-6.

Booborowie New Year Ball was an outstanding success both socially and financially.  Music was by Daphne Wenham’s Jamestown Band.  Harold Broad was MC.
