The Burra Railway Line is planned to be sold by the Federal Government.  The sale includes passenger rail, SA freight services and the Tasmanian Railway System.  There have been more than 30 expressions of interest.  AN says the broad gauge lines in SAâ€™s Mid North are not viable.  Studies by Rail 2000 however, suggest they are viable if not shackled to poor work practices.  The Burra track is in a very bad condition and has been neglected, but is nevertheless adequate for the present rail traffic.  [Bulk grain haulage.]

Those bidding for the SA lines appear to fall into two groups.  One would aim to keep operating only the profitable main line grain services and the Leigh Creek coal traffic.  The other would want to rehabilitate the system, including branch lines, with a long term regional commitment.  Rail 2000 is concerned that the government will take the highest bidder without reference to long term implications for SA.
