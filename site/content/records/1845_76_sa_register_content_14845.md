Advertisement.  Tenders are called for the carriage of mails for nine months from 1 October, fortnightly between Kooringa and Duffield’s Woolshed on the Eastern Plains, via Chewing’s, G. Williams’s, Paratoo, Tetulta and Winninie.  [Presumably the last two places should be Teetulpa and Winnininnie.]
