BCS.  Mr Doug Benton of Booborowie has begun work replacing the ceiling in the Kooringa Building.  A new solomit (strawboard) ceiling will be installed throughout except for the library.  Work will be completed by the start of the new school year.  New pine beams will be installed in the teaching area to hold an improved lighting system and to assist in the display of studentsâ€™ work.
