Railways.  Opening of the Northern Railway.

Last Tuesday an official party left Adelaide by special train for Orroroo, to which point the line had been opened.  They reached Quorn on Tuesday evening and proceeded to Port Augusta for the night.  Next morning the Governor, who had come to Port Augusta by sea, joined them and the formal opening of the northern line began.  A banquet was held at Quorn and most of the party returned to Adelaide.  The rest went on to Blinman and Government Gums (Farina).  The speeches are printed.  Over 3,000 gentlemen sat down to the banquet at Quorn in the railway goods shed, special additions to which had been roofed in canvas for the occasion.
