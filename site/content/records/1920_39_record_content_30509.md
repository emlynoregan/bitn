29 April

Philip John Rule was charged with being at the Royal Exchange Hotel on 27 April for the purpose of betting, but after the presentation of evidence the bench ruled that the evidence of betting having occurred was insufficient and the case was dismissed.

Ernest Wohling was fined £2 for carrying on a billiard saloon without a licence.  He got a minimum fine after explaining that the money was late in arriving in Adelaide, but only by a few hours.
