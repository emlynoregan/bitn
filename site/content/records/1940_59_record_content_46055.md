Burra Town Council, 5 June

Burra Red Cross advises of its support for any effort to obtain an ambulance for Burra & District.

The Town Clerk reported that three officials from the Housing Trust of SA had visited Burra and inspected various sites.  They proposed to purchase land in Queen Street for building purposes.  Quotes are to be obtained for a new or replacement Ford engine for the Corporation Truck.

The Overseer is to ascertain if they had sufficient bridge timber to renew the bridge near Mr J. Parksâ€™.

Council will make an approach to the new school house, under the usual conditions.
