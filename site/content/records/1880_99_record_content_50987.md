Redruth Court, 30 August.

W. Murphy, cab proprietor v. C. Grow, cab driver, for £19-19-0 for injury to the plaintiff’s horse.

H.V. Rounsevell for the plaintiff and D.S. Packard for defendant.

Murphy alleged that on 11 August at the Mine Bridge Grow drove such that the wheels of his cab passed over the foot of his off-side horse.  Grow he said was travelling at 16 or 17 m.p.h.  Rounsevell:  ‘My word I didn’t know there were such rapid animals in Burra.’

Plaintiff: ‘Well, his horses were cantering.’

Rounsevell: ‘Oh, well, there is no doubt about their pace after that.’

Murphy said his horse’s hoof was split and the flesh torn away and he had to hire a replacement at 7/6 a day.  He valued the horse at £7.  Grow offered £4 for it, but he did not accept.

Grow said Murphy wanted an outrageous £12 and later £10.

Thomas Murphy, his brother, gave similar evidence.

The horse had been bought from Bagot, Shakes & Lewis for £4.

C. Grow said they had both started from the standpipe in Market Square.  Murphy was ahead and whipping his horses all the way, keeping Grow against the side of the road, ‘we were racing’, ‘if Murphy had given me a fair share of the road the accident wouldn’t have happened.’

The accident occurred when Grow pulled to the near side to allow the passage of a vehicle coming the other way.

Thomas Hastie valued the horse at £5.  The verdict was for £5 with each party to pay its own costs.
