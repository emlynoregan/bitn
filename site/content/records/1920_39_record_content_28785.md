The Mayor’s Report for 1928

The Mayor presents his last report (at least for now).

The town continues to be well kept and to be advancing.

North Ward.

Railway Terrace has been re-metalled ready for tar-dressing.  Nine other streets have received considerable attention.  The Bon Accord Bridge was tar-dressed and many minor works done.

East Ward.

Ayers St has been put in good order.  5ft concrete pipes have been ordered for the creek crossing near Finch’s and the Council will replace the old structure there which is quite unsafe after 60 years.  This will cost c. £100.  A new footbridge has been placed at the corner of Paxton Square.  Eight other streets were placed in good order and footpaths tarred.

West Ward.

The full length of the western boundary road has been repaired, two new culverts placed in Commercial St, and one in each of Church St & Ware St and one near the hospital.  Significant repairs were made to seven other streets.

Parks and streets have 245 assorted pines, 50 kurrajongs and 50 flowering gums planted.  Mr E. Ford paid for 110 trees to be planted on the road at the northern edge of town.  Many dead and dying trees were removed.  The roof of the shed at Victoria Park was damaged in a storm and has been replaced at accost of £20.

The Cemetery is in good order.

The well and pump have been attended to.

The Fire Brigade has not been given much work, but just recently prevented the spread of a potentially serious fire.

The Burra Electric Supply Co. has not had a failure during the year and the town is well lighted.

Health.  The town is clean and there have been no outbreaks of disease this year.

Main Roads are in good order and with a little more money for the coming year it is intended to extend the tar south past the hospital and soon all the main roads will be tarred.

Assessment for 1927-28 was £17,394.  Rates at 2/6 in the £ were £2,174-5-0 and £2,155 was collected and of the £19 remaining £14-17-6 will come in by year’s end.

Finance.		The North Ward ends £59-2-2 in credit

The East Ward ends £58-17-4 in debit

The West Ward ends £45-13-4 in debit

The General account is £263-4-8 in credit.
