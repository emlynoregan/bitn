Football.  The ‘All Black’ football team from Swan Reach arrived at Burra at noon last Saturday and were met by P.L. Rosman, President of the Burra Football association.  Lunch was taken at Mr Rowe’s tea rooms in Aberdeen before they drove to Booborowie where a crowd estimated at over 1,000 attended.  The visitors were used to playing in sandy country without boots and were handicapped on Booborowie’s hard ground.

Burra		6.7	11.12	12.14	19.4	(128)

Swan Reach	0.3	0.3	7.8	10.10	(70)

Spear and boomerang exhibitions were given before the match and at half time.  £47-5-3 was taken at the gate, which was a record.  Profits go to the Swan Reach Mission.
