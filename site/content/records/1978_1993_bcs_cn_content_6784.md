The Synod of the [Anglican] Diocese of Willochra will meet at Burra 29-30 October – a gathering of representatives of twenty-four parishes and Mission Districts.  This will be the first synod to meet outside of the Iron Triangle since Burra became part of the Diocese in 1967.  The synod will be held in the Civic Centre and a special guest will be Bishop Samir Kafity, a Palestinian Arab, soon to be installed at Anglican Bishop in Jerusalem.  A Synod Eucharist will be offered in St Mary’s at 10 a.m.  The Bishop of Willochra (Bruce Rosier) will conduct a Confirmation Service for five candidates at St Mary’s on Sunday 7 November.
