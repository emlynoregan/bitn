2nd Leader on Lighting the Town.

When Cr Wicklein brought up the question of electric lighting we were inly surprised it had not been raised earlier.  Dozens of smaller towns in Australia manage it with good results.  The initial cost will probably be c. £4,000 and maintenance, depreciation sinking fund and interest will all total c. £600 p.a.  With over 300 houses in Kooringa alone and taking them all in would average c. £2 p.a. and though not every house would be connected, the hotels, shops and public buildings would compensate.  The present lighting costs of c. £90 p.a. represent an assured revenue.  In some towns the water supply is worked electrically and this could also be investigated.  Electricity is undeniably more economical and superior for lighting.  A generous lighting bill for electricity for a six-roomed villa in Adelaide is c. 7/- a month which compares well with kerosene at 5/- a tin.  Generally electricity could be supplied cheaper than that if the Council did not have to make a profit.  In addition to lighting electricity could provide for electric fans, electric irons and electric radiators.
