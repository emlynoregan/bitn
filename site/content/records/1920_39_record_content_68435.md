C. Fowler of Saddleworth writes decrying the way in which the Closer Settlement Act is being abused and the once cut-up large estates are being re-formed.  Many a heap of stones or group of trees is all that marks homesteads of the past – see this at Koonoona, Booborowie and Anlaby.  Michael Kelly’s block at Koonoona is the most recent.  Most District Councillors are large landowners, so it is not in their interest to do anything about it.  At the old surveyed town of Glendore, better known as Black Springs where many blocks have had unknown owners for 60 years I understand that most are held by two farmers by simply paying the rates.  Also it might curb some if removal of the improvements was stopped – for which I am very doubtful if the consent of the Commissioner has been obtained.
