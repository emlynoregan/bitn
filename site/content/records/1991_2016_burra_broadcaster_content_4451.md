The Department of Road Transport has responded to a Burra Burra DC request to provide a pull-off bay so trucks can drop their dust when entering Burra North along the Burra-Morgan Road.

The Burra Cemetery Committee recently decided to reposition four of the headstones from along the cemetery wall.  Pearse Memorials of Clare have restored the broken Chinese headstone.  Bennettâ€™s grave has been restored with its wooden surround.
