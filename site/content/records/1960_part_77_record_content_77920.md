Football

The Mid North Football League held its AGM 2 February.  President Mr S. Noske read the report for 1975.  There was a credit balance of $1,354.14.  G. Hirschausen & P. Reed moved that the Aberdeen FC be allowed to withdraw from the League and the Club to remain in recess.  It was then unanimously resolved to dissolve the League.  It was resolved to have a Mid North Football League Dinner. And to have the History of the Mid North Football League recorded by the League secretary and published.  $150 was retained to cover the basic publishing costs with one copy to go to each club and a further decision to be made on other copies.
