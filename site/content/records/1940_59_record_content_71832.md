Weather.  Thunderstorms in the past week have brought patchy rain.  Burra got 35 points on Saturday night and 10 on Sunday.  To the east Oakbank has received 109, but most other falls were small and patchy, varying from nil to 33 points, but the phones were down on Monday, so the reports are incomplete.
