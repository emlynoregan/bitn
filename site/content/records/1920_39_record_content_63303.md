That there Man

I remember him in all his glory standing erect upon the big engine house, pick and gad in hand, a representative of ‘That there Cornish Miner’.  It is said that a blacksmith working on the mine made him and placed him in position.  I have never heard him named.  He was always spoken as ‘that theere Man upto Mine’, and was a personality in those days.  Mothers trying to get a flock of unwilling children to bed would say ‘You’m childer best be going to bed or else you’m be having that there Man up along to Mine peeking in the window at ’ee.’  To which a saucy maiden would reply ‘Aw, us wodden keer would us?  ’tes a’ better, Meary, if we could only see him.  Ded ’ee ever see ’im yerself, mawther?’

A group of boys returning from carrying ‘feythers’ crib would gather round the big engine house.  One sharp little chap stands, legs wide apart, mouth open, eyes staring at ‘That there Man’.  ‘Whatever be the matter wi’ ’ee Tommy, what be ’ee glaring up along like that for?’  Alec replies ‘Tommy, if he du come down however do ’ee get up again?’

‘Whatever be ’ee talking about?’ asks Billy.

‘Why, when that theer man du here the clock strike twelve he du come down and run all around the town.  However dy he gey up along again?’

Jan’s reply is crushing – ‘Gose along home with ’ee thu gurt buffle head, whenever ded that Man heer clock strike?’

If he had sight, hearing and speech what tales ‘That there Man’ could tell you and me of the big engine over which he stood with its ‘Plonk! Plonk! Day and night, drawing up water from the shaft beneath and sending it flowing in to the little channels all over the hill; of the great whim with its rope the thickness of a man’s arm coiled around it, of the chimney; of the echo; of the big dump filling up the valley between the two hills leading into the township; its tramways and skips ascending and descending the incline by machinery into the cutting to be filled with refuse.  Arriving at the top they are drawn along the tramways by a patient pair of horses driven by their attendant boys.  At the end of the tip they are unloaded, their contents helping to fill the valley.

Of the houses built for the mine officials, the largest of 27 rooms, built for ‘Cappen’ Harry Roach; of the blacksmith’s shops with their glowing fires; of the varies sounds of a great hive of industry; of the shafts which the men descend to their work in cages; of the ‘sassy’ song of the mine boys which was

When I was a chicken no bigger ner a hen

Cappen Jinimy hit me

An’ I hit ’im agen.

Harry Cock came down to order me out

I up with me han’

An’ I give ’im a clout
