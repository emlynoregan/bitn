Bob Skinner writes to express his disappointment that Council is refusing to repair rhe Community Notice Board outside the Burra Newsagency following its being damaged by vandals.

‘This lack of community service by the Council is extremely regrettable, but not unusual.  The office staff get all the amenities, but the ratepayers are ignored.’
