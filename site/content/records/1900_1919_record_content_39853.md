Mrs Mary Blott, widow of William Blott, turned 94 on 3 December.  She was born in Cambridgeshire in 1820.  She has lived the last 20 years with her daughter Mrs Frank Smith, of Norwood.  Five of her siblings are still alive: Mr John Tilbrook of Koolunga (91), a sister in Adelaide (88), and James Tilbrook (90) in the UK.  The two eldest died aged 97 & 95.  Mr & Mrs Blott arrived in SA in 1849 on the Octavia and took up land in the Onkaparinga District, but failed.  Mr Blott then tried the Victorian Goldfields and on returning they came to Burra where they lived for many years.
