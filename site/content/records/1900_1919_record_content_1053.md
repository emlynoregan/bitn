Relief has been granted to 25 aged men and widows, 11 families (of 28 members).  478 orders have been made – 340 for firewood, 120 for groceries, and 18 for drapery.  £12-9-6 came from the Mackerode bequest and £13-19-6 from John Roach’s lantern entertainment.  E.C. Lockyer’s and Dr Brummitt’s garden Continentals raised £13-7-9.  The society greatly misses Dr Brummitt with his departure for England.
