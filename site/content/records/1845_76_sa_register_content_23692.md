Burra Mine

The half-yearly report of the SA Mining Association will be laid before the shareholders on 19 October.  The operations in the last six months have been limited to making an inclined cutting to more readily reach the ore.  The present length of the cutting is 162 ft and its depth is 74 ft.  When the stope now in hand is finished it is intended to drive into ‘The Old Flat’ and commence taking off the top stope bodily.  In the half-year 14,000 tons have been tipped 100 ft past the dressing tower.  The erection of the new machinery has progressed so that haulage on the great scale and the simultaneous dressing of ores is likely to commence in the latter part of November.  Experiments on processing low grade ores are still being made in London.  Land is being let and sold in Kooringa.  No produce has been obtained in the last half-year, so the usual profit and loss account is omitted.  The mine’s establishment on 30 September was 9 mechanics, 24 miners etc., 6 labourers, 6 boys and 6 officers.  Total 51.
