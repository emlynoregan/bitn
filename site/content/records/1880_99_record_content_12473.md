Burra Town Council

The flagging in Market Square to be done for 5½d per square foot.

The cemetery well is reported to have reached water at 39’.

SAMA has agreed to dedicate a road to the slaughterhouse if Council will pay to fence its eastern side.

Tenders to be called for kerbing in Thames St.

Burra Local Board of Health has received a report from the Central Board of Health Inspector who visited Burra on the 19 & 20 February.

He says Burra has an area of 3,600 acres and a population of 2,647, with 557 houses.

The drainage goes into Burra Creek, which is dry for 9 months of the year and is not used for drinking water.  The creek is the recipient of all household slops, bathwater, offensive liquids from the brewery, dead poultry etc.

Few properly constructed cesspits exist in town, but primitive structures are erected over deep holes in the ground, which is usually of a hard rocky nature.

The licensed nightman spreads nightsoil in one of Mr Forder’s paddocks.

The scavenger is required to visit houses regularly, but few of them have receptacles for rubbish.  The rubbish depots are near Kooringa and beyond Aberdeen and both are free from nuisance.

The Corporation Slaughterhouse and piggeries at Kooringa were in a very unsatisfactory condition.

Water for Kooringa and Aberdeen comes principally from wells, but Redruth is supplied with water laid on from the Bon Accord Mine.

Sanitary inspection seems quite perfunctory with the local inspector confining his attention to butchers’ premises, slaughterhouses, etc. and ignoring private homes.
