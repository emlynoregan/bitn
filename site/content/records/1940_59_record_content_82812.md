The Advertiser Three Day Cycling Tour.  The tour will reach Burra about 5.30 p.m. next Saturday, having started at 7.30 a.m. from Murray Bridge.  On Sunday they leave for the last leg to Adelaide via Clare and Balaklava.  The inclusion of world champion cyclist Russell Mockridge (killed on Saturday) and Sid Patterson would have made this one of the greatest road races in SA.  Mr Baulderstone has collected Â£15 for the prizes for the Burra Sprint.  It is anticipated there will be 90-100 people connected with the event in town over the weekend.
