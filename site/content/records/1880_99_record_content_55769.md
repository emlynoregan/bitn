Christmas in Burra.

The habit of decorating shop fronts with green boughs seems to be dying out and only two or three did so.  Chinese lanterns were in great demand.  Some shops did good business, but others not so well.  The rowdy element was largely absent.  Burra Brass Band played at various places and later went on carol playing throughout the night.  The Bible Christians held a fancy fair at the Institute and raised £25.  Christmas morning service at the Kooringa Wesleyan Church gave the proceeds to Burra Hospital.  Lodges and Councils attended.  The afternoon plans were somewhat upset by the rain and the Primitive Methodist Anniversary was carried on with some difficulty with few takers for the public tea.

Boxing Day Sports were postponed to 9 January, but to satisfy those who came in for the day a 3-mile and a 1-mile bike race were run.  A. Boyes won the former and Toms the latter.

The Salvation Army had ‘all day meals’ in the Barracks with special meetings throughout the day.
