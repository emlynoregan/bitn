Obituary.  Les Neagle was missing on Saturday morning and about 11.30 a.m. Stan Field looked over the partition between his shop and Mr Neagleâ€™s office and saw him dead on the floor.  It was clear when the police arrived that he had shot himself.  A shot had been heard about 8.30 a.m.  He was aged 34 and had come to Burra 17 years ago.  He had been employed by Mr Winnall and then set up as a land and estate agent and was also clerk on the District Council of Apoinga.  His legs had been badly smashed in a machinery accident in a tannery when he was 13 and they remained distorted.  Nevertheless he was a keen sportsman; playing golf, cricket and tennis and was a fine shot.  Lately however, his ankles had deteriorated and he suffered from neuritis with the prospect of soon being confined to a wheelchair.

[Born William Thomas Leslie Neagle at Mt Barker Springs 15 August 1892: died Kooringa 21 August 1926.]
