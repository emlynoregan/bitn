Burra Burra Show Inc. held its AGM at the Eastern Telephone Building on Friday 5 March.  President I.J. Warnes took the chair.  The deaths of two old members are regretted in T.H. Pearse of ‘The Gums’ and Mr M. Pederson of Kooringa.  Mr Pearse was a great supporter and for years helped with cups.  Mr Pederson when younger was a great worker and took a keen interest and his opinion and advice was always reliable.

The Dog Trials were held 22 & 23 April.  Entries were down, but quite satisfactory.  The financial loss was not quite so large as usual and the effort helps sustain the standard of sheep dogs.

Membership was slightly down this year.

Working bees have helped to keep onion weed down.

The annual show on 25 October was very successful in good weather.  Gate takings were up.  Exhibits were of high quality and competition was keen.

This year we have been allotted 24 October for the show.  The budget was balanced this year.

Last year one debenture was given back and some paid off.  This year in response to an appeal the following gentlemen have returned debentures:	A.J. & P.A. McBride (4)
