Christmas 1848 at Kooringa

A large number of people assembled at the Burra racecourse on 27 December for a race meeting.

In the first race over 2 miles Little Wonder, ridden by John O’Leary, won the first heat.  Ivanhoe ridden by Wallace Jnr, won the second heat.  This result was disputed by Little Wonder’s rider, on the grounds that Ivanhoe’s rider dismounted before returning to the post.  Ivanhoe, won the third heat, beating the only other runner, Colonel Ginger after Little Wonder and Parson were withdrawn under protest.

The second race was a 1½ mile hurdle, but it had to be abandoned.  Thunderbolt stood stock still before the first hurdle and the Maid of All Work and the Bride refused to take the second hurdle.  The prize was added to that for the third race.  This was over 1½ miles and was won by Will o’ the Wisp, ridden by Benjamin Bailey.

The next race was for beaten horses, and was won by Colonel Ginger, ridden by John Haimes.

The Hurry Scurry was won by Williamy, ridden by E. Langmead.

The weather was ideal except for the dust.

Unfortunately we have to report an accident at the course.  William Harris, aged about 13, was knocked down by a horse and suffered contusions and a fractured collar-bone.

Our correspondent speaks very highly of visible improvements in the state of society at Burra Burra.  When he went there to live two years ago, he had heard it described as ‘a hell upon earth’.  He was determined to see with his own eyes a place which had become so notorious; and now, after the experience of two years, he quite extols the Burra Burra and its inhabitants.

He admits there may be a rough blade or two among them, but in the aggregate there does not exist in this colony, of an equal area, with an equal number of people, a community that better evidences their claim to the coarse, but meaningful title of ‘a set of good fellows’ than the lads of the Burra.

Whatever faults they have in common with the rest of mankind, at any rate they have principle and honesty to boot.

Christmas passed remarkably well.  Proper decorum and solemnity throughout the day.  Divine worship was observed, public houses and shops were closed and there was no rioting or drunkenness.
