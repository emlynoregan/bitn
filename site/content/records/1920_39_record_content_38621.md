W. Anderson has just received from England the envelope from a letter sent on the first air mail to leave Australia for there.  It was dated 20 April at Kooringa and was back again on 18 June.  It would have been returned much more quickly had the plane in question not broken down, requiring relief planes to carry the mails.  The cost of an airmail letter is 1/11.
