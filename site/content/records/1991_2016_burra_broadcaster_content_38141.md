Hallett Community Management Committee called a meeting on Monday to consider re-opening the Hallett Swimming Pool.  Sixty people attended.  The plastic liner needs replacing and a number of edge tiles have to be replaced.  Quotes for the repairs are about $12,500.  Last year the expenditure was about $12,000 and the income about $9,000.  Many at the meeting felt that the HCMC should be able to accommodate this, given that it had an income and expenditure last year of about $27,000 and finished the year with nearly $47,000 in the bank.  Goyder Council CEO Steve Kerrigan said the HCMC put in its application for ward funding late, so the Council had not been able to consider funding for repairs.
