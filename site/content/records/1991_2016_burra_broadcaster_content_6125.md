Burra Community Print

Cory Heneker, our second year apprentice has topped his first year at Croydon Park School of Printing and Graphic Arts.  Gone are the days of lead type and linos, now he and fellow apprentice Julie Pawelski, formerly of the Northern Argus, share the workload on the latest desktop publishing equipment.
