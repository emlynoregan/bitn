Burra Tyres

From 1 July Russell and Lisa Murphy (nee Smedley) have taken over the business from Ron and Geraldine Smedley.  Lisa’s father, Ron took over the business from Jennisons some 15 years ago and Russell has been working there for almost three years.  Ron says the family tradition of dedicated service will continue.  The site of the business in Commercial Street has long been a part of Burra’s commercial landscape.  Mr Horton Jennison started here in 1922 as a BMC dealer and tyre repairer and vulcaniser.  Passenger car tyres were retreaded on site for many years until the process was made uneconomic by the multiplicity of sizes and treads.  The retreading plant was sold in the late 1950s.  Ray Jennison joined the business in 1956 and Jennison’s Tyre Service expanded and thrived, employing at one time twelve people.  A fire in 1985 severely damaged the premises and later that year the Burra Tyres section of the business was sold to Ron and Geraldine Smedley.  Frank Fennell was a long-time employee from 1960 into the Smedley era for some years.
