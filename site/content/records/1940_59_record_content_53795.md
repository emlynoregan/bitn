Burra’s Tribute to King George VI was held on Friday 15 February at 11 a.m.  Clem Davey played Chopin’s Funeral March.  The service was conducted by Rev. C. Christopher & Rev. S.W. Line (Methodists) and Lt Coffey (Salvation Army).  Rev. R.S.T. Pettet (Anglican) was absent on furlough.

Mayor W. Carpenter outlined the purpose of the meeting and spoke of the late King’s courage and of the sympathy extended to the members of the Royal family.  Lt Coffey led a prayer and scripture passages were read by Rev. Line, followed by another prayer from Lt Coffey and scripture passages from Rev. Christopher, who then gave the occasional address.  [This is printed and extends to page 4.]  The hymn Abide With Me then followed, after which Rev. Line said prayers for the new Queen, the Queen Mother and Queen Grandmother.  The last Post was followed by a two-minute silence and Reveille.  The gathering ended with the National Anthem: God Save the Queen.  The audience included Mr G.S. Hawker MP, members of the Town and District Councils, staff & students of the High School and a good number of returned servicemen led by Mr I. Richardson, President of the local RSL.
