After its revival 18 months ago vigorous work by the society has produced a phenomenal success.  £73 was taken at the gate and £45 in entries.  The new shed was a great improvement and so were the arrangements for cattle.

Agricultural produce was well represented, though some grain was not clean and some farmers need to secure new improved machinery for cleaning wheat if they expect to receive top price.

Butter and eggs were well represented.  Ham and bacon drew few entries, but they were of good quality.  Mr Duldig’s butter was complimented.

Poultry was one of the big attractions.  Entries came from as far as Broken Hill and Adelaide.  Pigeons increased both in quality and quantity.

Draught stock was a fair representation

Blood stock drew few, but good quality entries, while roadster stock drew a good number.

Cattle numbers were fair, but quality was generally not good.

Dog entries were few, but included some good ones.

Sheep produced a fine display with impressive entries from Mr Collins, J.H. Riggs, G.A. Gebhardt, Koonoona Station and Kadlunga Estate among them.

Only one pig was entered.

Agricultural implements were conspicuously absent.

Vegetables were impressive with Mr C. Oppermann of Redruth particularly notable.

Flowers had been damaged by rain just before the show and the date falls awkwardly between seasons, but there were still some choice blooms.

School class entries were good.

The concert in the evening was the most successful ever, financially and otherwise.  Over £32 was taken.

[Of personal interest:

Ah Chin won the collection of salad vegetables.

In flowers the description credits Mr Fuss with a fine collection of 24 varieties, but in the prize list it is Mrs Fuss who is named as winning 10/- for 24 cut flowers and 5/- for 6 cut flowers.

We can assume this was Mrs H.C.W. Fuss as H.C.W. had died on 25 April 1895.]
