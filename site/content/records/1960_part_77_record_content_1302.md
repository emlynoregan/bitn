Burra Town Council, 7 March

No tenders were received for the old swing bridge.  Its disposal was left in the hands of the Mayor.

A building permit was granted for the Burra Show Society’s Wool Pavilion.  Its estimated cost was £1,000.

[A rather late application!]

Aberdeen Tennis Club applied for use of tennis courts for a tournament on Easter Sunday 1 p.m. to 6 p.m.

Approved with some opposition from Crs Lehmann and Lloyd.

Cheque received for £237 from the Government Tourist Bureau – to be passed on to the Swimming Pool Committee.
