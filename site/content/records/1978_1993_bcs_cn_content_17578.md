Coppertown Festival

The 1988 Festival was a success with an estimated profit of $1,500.  Expenses involved with funding the festival were about $6,000.  Because the numbers attending were down due to many outside circumstances and a general lack of community support, the committee, whose involvement is purely voluntary, have decided to go into indefinite recess.  Funds will be invested, some of which will go into a community project as the need arises.  Chris Reed, Co-ordinator and Elly Nicholls, Secretary.
