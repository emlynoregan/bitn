Burra Ambulance Service in the last six months answered 58 calls.  The Board of Management recently ordered a Ford Transit Vehicle and has also purchased a cardiac monitor and defibrillator for use in the ambulance.  The radio and bleeper system has made the system more efficient and more prompt.  The hydraulic rescue cutters (Jaws of Life) were also purchased this year.
