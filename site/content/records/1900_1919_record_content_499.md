Obituary.  Mrs Mary Ann Lane was a colonist of 50 years, having arrived with her husband and four children in October of 1849.  They settled in North Adelaide.  Soon her husband and two eldest boys went to the Victorian gold rush where her husband caught cold and died in the Geelong Hospital.  A few years later she lost first the second and then the eldest son, since when she has lived with her youngest son, the Kooringa postmaster, John Lane.  She came from Hereford.  In the UK she was a member of the Countess of Huntingdonâ€™s Connection, but that not being represented here, she became a Wesleyan.  She died from jaundice following influenza contracted a few months since.  She died at Glenelg on 18 February, aged 84 years 10 months.
