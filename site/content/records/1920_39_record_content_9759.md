Booborowie people held a public meeting on 16 December and discussed the removal of the post office to the town.  The present location over a mile from the town was most inconvenient.  The only drawback to the move could be that now the telephone was available at any time in an emergency, and this might not be so if it moved.  It was thought that this could be resolved somehow.
