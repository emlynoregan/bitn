Damming the Burra Creek

M.F. Toal writes in support of damming the creek, likening the effect on Burra to the improvement effected in Adelaide by the Torrens Weir.  Expert opinion would be needed though on how to avoid stagnant water.

H.J.B. Jennison also writes supporting the idea and in favour of the possible swimming possibilities and gardens.

M.A. Radford of ‘Canegrass’ writes urging caution.  In the event of a major flood coming down he says remember that Burra is at the junction of two valleys; from the north and the south.  Water has enough difficulty passing through the bottleneck at Burra without taking the town with it.  On at least two occasions this would have happened if the river had been dammed at the place proposed.  The danger would be less with a dam below the cemetery.  Since the bed is on slate the main gain from the dam would be increased flow in the spring at Princess Royal.  Silting of the dam would likely be another problem and in dry times the beauty spot would become a stagnant pool to the menace of the health of the town.

The editor comments that the advice of a qualified engineer would have to be sought before proceeding.
