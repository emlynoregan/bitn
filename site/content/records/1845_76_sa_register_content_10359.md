The English & Australian Copper Company

The AGM of the proprietors was held at the London Tavern on Monday 21 July with Sir William Foster, Bart. in the chair.  The Chairman said the meeting was called in accordance with the deed of settlement, but as Mr Hamilton had not taken stock at the end of December, they could not present the accounts.  He considered Mr Hamilton had been wise not to suspend operations at the busiest time of the year and they hoped to receive the accounts in five or six weeks.  He proposed to adjourn the meeting for two months.  The Directors had made the best report they could.  It should satisfy the shareholders to know that Mr Hamilton had sent money (and material) sufficient to pay off all the debentures, and to leave a balance in hand.

Mr Jennings said he understood that the sale of the Spitty Works would have paid off the debenture debt.

Mr Schneider reminded shareholders that the liabilities were upwards of £50,000, independent of the debentures.

The Directors’ Report

Without encouraging unreasonable expectations, it is reasonable to expect material improvements in the ensuing season.  The great problem has been the lack of labour following the gold discoveries.  This could neither have been foreseen nor guarded against.  The effect was to completely paralyse activity.  At first all operations were suspended and then when resumed, they were of necessity on a very limited scale.  The necessity, under the terms of the contract, of delivering all copper made to the SA Mining Association, left the company’s share exiting only in ore that they were unable to smelt at the company’s works.  This has resulted in a heavy drawback on the company’s finances, but when these evils are overcome a very different state of affairs can be anticipated.

Mr Hamilton’s reports not say that the smelting works have been restored to activity.  Labour has again become plentiful as the attraction of the goldfields has reduced.  The smelters sent out by the directors have arrived; supplies of coal have arrived, as have the wagons to make the mules serviceable.

From March 1855 to February 1856 the copper smelted was 1,395 tons 5 cwt 2 qr 10 lb

The ore consumed was 4,792 tons 12 cwt.

In the previous year the copper smelted was 511 tons.

Mr Hamilton reports he will undertake to take stock at the works in April.  Until this report is received the Directors cannot present a complete balance sheet of the company’s affairs.
