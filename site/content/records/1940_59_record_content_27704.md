Burra & District Soldiers’ Welfare Committee held its wind-up meeting on Friday evening 2 August in the Burra Town Council chamber.  It was chaired by T.H. Woollacott.  The committee was formed soon after the outbreak of war and organised farewells for 222 service personnel and gave each a token of appreciation.  It also welcomed home many of the servicemen and women.  Of all who went only twelve have not received token and that will be remedied.  The 6/4 in hand will be transferred to the Burra Victory Committee.
