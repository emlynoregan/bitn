Meals on Wheels has been operating in Burra for 35 years.  CEO Cam Pearce and Vice-President Glen Mattingley attended a gathering in Paxton Café to present the branch with a commemorative wheel and long service badges to members: Pauline Venning & Shana Nourse received 15-year badges and Eunice Baker a 30-year badge.  Jan Tiver said times had changed since the beginning when three people were needed to walk around the town carrying billies of meat, gravy, soup and sweets and if you couldn’t make it or forgot you felt awful, knowing the others would have a hard time carrying it all.  And there was a lot of washing up as well.  Now meals are kept at the right temperature and professionally packed in foil containers.  [Photo.]
