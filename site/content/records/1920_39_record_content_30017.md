Boy Scouts.  For some time a group of boys has been working in Burra as a Wolf Cub Pack under Rev. J.S.W. Coles.  Having reached scout age they have been formed into a Scout Troop with D.T. McBain as Scoutmaster.  His warrant was presented as a meeting at St Mary’s Hall on 7 March by Commissioner for St Kilda District, Victoria, Mr A. Valentine Soul.  Mr McBain had been a scout since the age of 13 in Colchester England and had risen to Assistant Scoutmaster when he left England in 1926.  The Mayor was proposed as Patron and Mr J.H. Bryant as President.  F.W.G. Twist is Treasurer and Mrs Hann is Secretary.  Rev. Coles is the Chaplain.  The committee is to see about the use of the Scout Hall.
