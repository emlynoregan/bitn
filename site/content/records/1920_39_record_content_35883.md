Redruth Methodist Sunday School had perfect conditions on Sunday last for their anniversary.  Rev. F.J. Barnes preached the three services.  A number of children were missing due to the present epidemic of whooping cough and influenza.  Another sad factor was the death of Mrs Ingamells on Saturday.  She was the wife of Rev. E.M. Ingamells one of Redruthâ€™s late pastors.  Attendances at the tea meeting on Monday were good despite the terrific dust storm.  [Obituary: Born Mabel Gwendolen Fraser 26 July 1884 Kew near Glanville: died Mabel Gwendolen Ingamells 1 November 1930 Rose Park.]
