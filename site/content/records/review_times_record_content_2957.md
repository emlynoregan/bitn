Burra Town Rates are likely to rise this year.  District Clerk Mr R. Walsh said the rural rates were subsidising the townships of Burra, Mt Bryan and Farrell Flat and were excessive in proportion to the town rates.  The Council will petition the Minister for Local Government in October to change the rating system from one based on land value to one based on capital value.  [That is from unimproved vales to improved values, which would have the effect of an increase in town rates.]
