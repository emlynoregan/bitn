Mr Burt Broad recently complained that he could not obtain a permit to start a butchering business in Burra because the Meat Industries Board said Burra was well catered for in the butchering trade and he had not been in the business before enlisting.  The local RSL took up the matter and now a wire advises Mr Broad will be granted the necessary permit.
