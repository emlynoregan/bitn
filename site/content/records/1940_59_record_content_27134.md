Burra Ratepayers’ Meeting

Mr R.J. Jeffery presided.

Mr Jeffery observed that in his opinion damming the creek was too big a project for Burra.

The four candidates for East Ward were invited to speak.

E.T. Baulderstone

He paid tribute to retiring Mayor T.H. Woollacott.  He did not approve of Councillors carrying around their own nominations forms to be signed.  He thought the two things the town needed were employment and entertainment and thus the Council needed to encourage every project that would create jobs and if that succeeded the entertainment would follow.

R.C. Lott

The incoming Mayor had mentioned better lighting for some streets.  He thought the Burra Electric Supply Co. could help with the cost of this.  He said some years ago the Council had the opportunity to buy the company, but had not done so.  The company lived on the town and yet the Council got little assistance from it.  It did not even pay rates on its poles.

If damming the creek could be done economically it would make Burra the best town in the North.

He saw no objection to councillors carrying their own nomination forms.

Mr S. Sykes

He regretted Mr Bevan’s absence.  Although Mr Bevan had done a lot of work for the town East Ward ratepayers might want a change because Mr Bevan was not a ratepayer in East Ward.  Ratepayers should not treat the Council Election as a joke.  They should elect a person with time to carry out his duties – as was his own case.  With respect to a swimming pool, his experience from elsewhere suggested enthusiasm would soon fade and in a year or two it would be mainly used by visitors.
