Mongolata Goldfield

Baldina Mongolata GM Syndicate for fortnight ending 3 June.

Adit.  The winze has been sunk to 60ft.  The drive north on a leader advanced to 14ft with traces of gold on a 6” face.  Connected the adit with old workings.  Two men are prospecting the bottom level with no results to date.  Shifted to drive off winze in adit, erected staging and started to drive.  Two or three fair specimens after 4ft.

Two tons of ore for paddock, value at about 5dwt.

Weather.  It has been very cold with rain in the last week to farming and pastoral areas.  In farming areas the range was from 80 points to over 100.  To the east some falls exceeded 125 points, but most were between 70 & 125, but some stations got much less: King’s Well 30, Kia Ora 40, Braemar 30 & Faraway 60.
