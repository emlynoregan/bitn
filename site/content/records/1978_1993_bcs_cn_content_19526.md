Back to Leighton

More than 500 people attended an extremely successful celebration.  Mr P. Hewton officially and sadly closed the school with the unveiling of a plaque mounted on a piece of local stone.  The dance on Saturday night was well attended and Sunday saw lots of fun with novelty events at the oval.  The school will close at the end of the present term.
