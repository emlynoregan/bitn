Obituary.  Mr John Hallett has died.

He came to SA on the Africaine towards the end of 1836.  He purchased a town acre in Adelaide in the first land sale held there on 27 March 1837 and contributed towards the erection of the first Wesleyan Chapel and in March 1838 was a member of six gentlemen to consider measures relative to the Aborigines.  He soon entered into business with the late Captain Duff and at the close of that business became a pastoralist.  At his death he held Murninnie Station 60 or 70 miles north of Burra and the Wandilta [Wandillah?] Station not far from Burra.  He was a shareholder in several  mining companies, including the Adelaide Land and Gold Co., the Worthing and the Murninnie.  He had a substantial brick house erected on South Terrace, which has since been demolished.  On 9 March 1857 he was elected in conjunction with Mr T. Reynolds to represent the District of Sturt in the first House of Assembly under the new Constitution Act.  On 23 March 1860 he was re-elected in connection with Mr Joseph Peacock.  In 1862 he was again a candidate, but was defeated and he also failed in an attempt to enter the Legislative Council in 1863.  Eight years ago he took up residence at Ilfracombe near Beaumont.  In July 1866 he was taken ill with apoplectic symptoms and never fully recovered.  He transferred control of his business to his brother, Alfred.  Of late he has suffered from softening of the brain and has had three attacks of serious apoplexy.  Bronchitis set in about a fortnight ago.  He died [at Ilfracombe] on 10 June and was buried in the Magill Cemetery.  He has left a widow and ten children; five sons and five daughters.  Of the daughters, one is married to Mr Carlile of Mickolo, Western Plains; one to Dr Goldsmith of Robe and another to Mr Woods of the SA Bank at Robe.  [Born in Essex, UK 30 August 1804.]
