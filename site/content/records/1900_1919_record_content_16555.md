Paull’s Mine.  The half-yearly meeting will be held in Adelaide 1 March.  The new concentrating plant can handle 120 tons per day with three shifts.  With the present price of copper good profits should be made.  In the year 98 tons 10 cwt of concentrates had been sent away at an av. 18%.  Hopes are that the machinery will be operational by mid-March.
