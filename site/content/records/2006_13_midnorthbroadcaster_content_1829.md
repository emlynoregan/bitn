Redbanks Conservation Park open day recently attracted large crowds.  On Thursday 28 September over 100 students from district schools and 75 community members attended.  District Ranger Ian Falkenberg was pleased.  Experts were on hand to give information on vegetation, reptiles, birds, and fossil discoveries.  Flinders University associate professor Rod Wells and Aaron Cumens from Adelaide University explained some recent discoveries.  The fossils here are particularly well preserved.  The latest Diprotodon fossil was of a teenaged specimen, which is rare.  The first reported discoveries of a Diprotodon were along Baldina Creek in 1889.  Since then seven localities have yielded finds of Diprotodons as well as a Tasmanian tiger.  The fossil discoveries add a different potential source of tourist development for the district.
