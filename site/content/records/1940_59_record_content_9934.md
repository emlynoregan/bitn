Sgt N. Jesser & Cpl T. Carpenter were given a social at Burra Institute on Monday 20 April.  The Mayor presided.  Pte Hall of the AIF who recently returned from abroad was also welcomed as was Rev. H. Bartlett who recently returned to Australia from New Guinea.  Musical items were intermingled by Mrs Max Pearce, Miss Mavis Fairchild and Mr Guy Dollman, who also led the community singing.  Rev.
