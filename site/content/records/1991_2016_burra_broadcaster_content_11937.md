The District Councils of Hallett, Burra Burra, Robertstown and Eudunda signed a memorandum of understanding to investigate and report on likely gains from an amalgamation of their councils.  The working party of two members and the CEO from each council met in June.  The Ratepayers’ Association repeatedly asked the Council why the option of a merger with Clare was not being pursued.  A very poorly attended public meeting was held and reported in the Broadcaster of 14 August.  Graham Kellock said it was hoped to have the amalgamation in place by March 1997, before Council elections.
