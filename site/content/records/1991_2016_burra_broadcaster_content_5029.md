Letter.  Anthony Thorogood writes in response to a report of yellow orchids by the mine entrance.  They are in fact Native Primroses – Goudenia.  There are also white ones nearby.  Another native in the district that looks like an orchid is the Native Leek with a long stem of yellow flowers.  Other local native flowers include Billy Buttons, a Blue Bell, Poached Egg Daisies, Lambs Tails and Purple Calostemma – also Spear grass, Lomandra and native peas.  (Not to mention flowering weeds.)
