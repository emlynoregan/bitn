Tothill’s Creek News

A school was recently re-opened here and I am glad to say that the new master seems to give general satisfaction.  He already has over 30 pupils on his books and there is good reson to expect he will soon have 40 if not more.  The school is held in the Primitive Methodist Chapel, which is a neat and commodious room, capable of accommodating upwards of 60 students.  The master is seriously inconvenienced by the lack of any nearby living accommodation.  He has to live over three miles away and this has prevented his opening a night class for adults, which is much needed.  Meetings to address this need have failed, for whatever reason, to gather support and it is feared that if nothing is done the school may again close.

Mrs Woodhead of Mintaro has taken over Mr Dorg’s Post-Office Store, which had been shut for a considerable period and this will supply a hard felt need, making the inconvenience and added expense of obtaining supplies from Kapunda or Burra unnecessary.

Many farmers are carting wood to the Burra or wool from the northern sheep stations.
