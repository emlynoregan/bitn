Burra High School students had an excursion to Adelaide last Friday.  They caught the train at 6.55 a.m.  On arrival they were taken to Torrenside Woollen Mills at Torrensville, after which they drove through the Torrens Gorge to lunch at the Gorge Kiosk and had a half-hour break in the picnic area.  This was followed by a visit to the Lenswood Packing Sheds where each child received an apple.  The return via Basket Range, Ashton and Norton Summit included a stop at Morialta Reserve.  There was time for a brief visit to the Museum before tea at the Railway Station and their train (with an extra carriage for them) that arrived just after 9.30 p.m.
