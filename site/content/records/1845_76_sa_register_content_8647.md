Gold Discovery.  Several miners from Burra have gone to test the newly reported discovery of gold at Black Springs*.  A gentleman in the neighbourhood reports seeing them washing stuff, but there are no verifiable report of gold.  [Note that Ian Auhl has added the note that the report was of gold at Black Rock not Black Springs.]
