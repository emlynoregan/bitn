R.J.J. Ockenden writes re some recent allegations in some quarters that the Labor Party dominates the Town Council.  Nonsense, he says, or else his proposal to pay the Council employees the minimum wage of 7/- per day would have been carried.  He says his successor will try again to get the Council to fall into line with others in the state.
