Mongolata Goldfield

Baldina Mongolata GM Syndicate for the fortnight to 19 July.

Farnden’s Hill.  Continued rise in stope.  Values are consistent (1oz).  The leader is small.  No values in eastern leader.   A parcel of ore is booked for the battery.

Mrs Arthur Gask was farewelled from Leighton on 8 July.  She is to live in Adelaide.

G. Wohling spent three hours in a tree one day last week when attacked by a bull while rabbiting on ‘Princess Royal’.  The bull is to be destroyed.

AC1 Bob Selth failed to realise how sharp the turn was coming out of Ridgway’s Lane and crashed into the wall at the approach to the Black Bridge at Redruth.  Luckily it is strongly built and prevented a 20ft drop.  Both wall and car were badly damaged.  [Ridgway’s Lane?  Perhaps Helen Terrace?]
