Working conditions: Editorial advocated 1/2 day holiday each week for shop assistants as they were then working from 7 or 8 am to 7.30 pm Mon. to, Fri. and till 11 pm on Sat. The suggestion was for an early closing day - perhaps Wed.

Entertainment: There had been no horse racing at Burra since 1873 - suggestion that it be revived.

Lynch's Bell Ringers were favourably reviewed and though poorly attended the 1st night were crowded the 2nd.

Carandini Co. was excellent and attendance disappointing. Well attended night 1, but only 50% the second night.

500-600 attended the Redruth Wesleyan Sunday School Picnic and Sports, but it was rather windy.

Public Tea & Meeting for Redruth Primitive Methodist Chapel Anniversary.

Offences: Foolhardy youths were running in front of horses and touching the animal's head before leaving in time to escape being run over. Dangerous to both the youth and the driver of the vehicle.

T. Shortridge Sen. Obituary: - died 2 Nov. a resident of 23 years who came as an interpreter for the Spanish speaking muleteers and then worked for SAMA almost till his death.

[Thomas Shortridge died at Kooringa 2 November 1876 aged 61.]
