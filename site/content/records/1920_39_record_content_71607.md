Burra Hospital Board met for the first time as newly constituted; now with seven members appointed by the District Councils and the Town Council.  The Chairman I.J. Warnes referred to the death of a former member Major Lance Lewis and a minute’s silence was observed.

Sir John Melrose retired from the Board citing his failing hearing as the reason.  He had been an active member for many years.  The financial statement showed a credit balance of £106-17-0; the first time for a considerable period they had been in credit.
