Redruth Court, 15 October.

Eric Blott was charged with using insulting language in Morehead St on 5 October.  He pleaded not guilty.  Similar charges against William March and Edwin Hopkins were subsequently withdrawn.  The extensive report runs to 1â…“ columns over a relatively trivial matter, which resulted in the bench finding insufficient evidence to convict, though there was evidence of unseemly behaviour.
