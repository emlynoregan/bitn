Obituary.  Mr J. Loudon of Booborowie died and the body was brought in yesterday and sent to Adelaide by rail.  [James Loudon died 1 January 1905 at Booborowie Station.]

He was taken ill a few weeks ago with cancer of the neck and his body was sent to Burra on Tuesday.  He was 61 and had been manager of Booborowie Sheep Station for over 20 years.  He had been Chairman of the Booborowie DC for many years and took a great interest in all sports and lent the large shed willingly for anything likely to advance the interest of the young.  He arrived in SA in the 1850s and went to work on his fatherâ€™s station at Carrawirralo before accepting the position of manager at Booborowie Station.
