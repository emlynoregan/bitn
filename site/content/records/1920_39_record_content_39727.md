CWA meeting 16 October in the RSL billiard room.  Mrs Warnes gave a report on the Conference and of the meetings in September & October of the National Council of Women.  She was interested in the workings of the Burra Institute Library as she felt women did not read enough.  She read a letter from the librarian A.A. Davey which detailed how the library works.  [The letter is printed in full.]
