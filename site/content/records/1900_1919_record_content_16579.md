The Burra Mine.  The Burra Burra Copper Co.  The new pumping plant has been erected and should start operation during the next fortnight.  The engineers have been quick at getting the plant together, especially as they had to move a couple of tons weight at a time with ropes, pulleys and rollers.  Two steep embankments had to be negotiated with the last one leading to the water if any piece had got away.  It is now said that when the water is lowered to the 50ft level a few men will be ‘set’ there.  Others say that the water will be forked before the 40ft level.  Some say test shafts will be sunk around the pool.  The decision to stop all tributing came as a great surprise, as up to then it had been expected that on beginning pumping at least 30 men would be put on.  Old hands that have been there years are now looking for other situations.  Work at Bunts’s is progressing with not very gratifying results.
