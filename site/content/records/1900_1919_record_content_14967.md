Mrs Ward’s cow, which is being cared for during her absence by Mrs Beven, is normally turned into O’Leary’s paddock.  Yesterday morning it was found to have been shot in the udder and on investigation no fewer than 40 distinct shot wounds were counted and about 12 in the flank.  The wound was sickening to look at and the animal was in excruciating pain.  About three weeks ago the same animal was stabbed in the flank.  Police are investigating and we hope the public will give any aid they can to clear up this atrocious and abominable incident.

Burra Musical & Dramatic Club presents Our Boys, the original drama by H.J. Byron, in the Institute on Friday.

Kooringa Methodist Church Anniversary was held last Sunday when Rev. Kessell preached.  The tea meeting was on Monday.
