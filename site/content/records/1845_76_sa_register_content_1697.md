The ‘Reformer’ Stage-cart Upset

The cart left Harris’s Hotel on Tuesday morning and stopped at the Gilbert for dinner.  The river had risen and the mail cart was detained.  Reformer then crossed the river safely, but the passengers had remained on the other side.  The driver agreed to return and collect the passengers, but he forgot to shift his weight to the windward side and the cart tipped over, breaking the roofing.  The horses brought it into about 18 inches of water.  The cart was then righted and the driver assured everyone the accident had been entirely due to his omission to shift position, but no passengers were prepared to risk the crossing and the driver continued on alone.

Reformer is also reported to have swum across the Gawler River yesterday unaided, while all others crossed with the aid of ropes.
