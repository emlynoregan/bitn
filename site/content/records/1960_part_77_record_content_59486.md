There is no hard and fast location for most items, but the following gives an idea of where they commonly appear.

Page 1 is devoted to news.

Page 2 is half news and half advertisements.

Page 3 is similar to page 2.

Page 4 is mostly advertisements and the ‘50 years Ago’ column.

Page 5 is mostly advertising and sport.

Page 6 carries the ‘Out and About’ column, which is at once valuable and informative and annoyingly brief on some matters.  The ‘Cash Column’ of small advertisements is usually here and the rest of the space is given over to public notices and advertisements.

Pages 7 & 8 are split fairly evenly between advertisements and news, along with items of general interest.

In the football season the equivalent of a full page of results is scattered about, but even so they are often incomplete.
