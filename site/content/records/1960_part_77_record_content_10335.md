Attempted Robbery.  An attempt was made on the night of 14 March to blow the lock on the strong room at Bence’s Ltd in Burra.  The door became jammed.  Entrance was obtained to the building via a skylight and then via a manhole in the office ceiling.  The robbery was unsuccessful, though considerable damage was done.  Frocks and materials were burned or scorched when used to deaden the noise.
