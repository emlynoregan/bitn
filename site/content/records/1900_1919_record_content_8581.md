Ramblers Football Club held their 2nd annual picnic at Johnson’s Creek last Wednesday.  They left for the site at 2 p.m. and once there various games were played – drop handkerchief, cricket, football and other games.  The spread was excellent.  [Jam tarts, sausage rolls and sandwiches are specifically mentioned.]  A start was made for home at 8 p.m.  The team played Clare and Petersburg away this year, but lost both games.  At home they beat Clare, but lost to Petersburg.  Of the six local matches played they lost 4 and won 2.
