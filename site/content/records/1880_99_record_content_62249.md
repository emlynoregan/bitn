Rev. Father O’Dowling was farewelled on Thursday evening when he was presented with a Gladstone bag and a purse of sovereigns.  He has been very ill for several weeks, but has hopes of a speedy recovery.  There was a large attendance at the schoolroom including Rev. F. Norton of Petersburg and Father Lee of Marrabel as well as Father Deitel*, the new incumbent.  The Choir presented an umbrella and other gifts and there were suitable gifts from scholars at the school.  Father Christen spoke followed by Mr D.J. O’Leary who recounted at some length the achievements of the last 13 years, during which time the residence at the church had been provided.  Father O’Dowling had collected the money for that before it was built and he had also raised large sums towards liquidating the debts on the church, school and convent.  He had also taken much interest in the Hibernian Lodge.  [*Actually Dietel.]
