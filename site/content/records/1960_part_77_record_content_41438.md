Obituary.  Mr J.B. (Jack) Rowe died at Burra Hospital on 12 July.  His death severs one of the last links with the sheep droving era of the pastoral lands east and north of Burra.  He was born in Burra on 12 January 1907, the eldest son of the late Jack and Helen Rowe.  He worked with sheep practically all his life and was a well known figure around the sale yards.  He was regularly sought when sheep had to be mustered for shearing and was employed on most of the properties in the eastern pastoral area.  He worked for over a period of thirty years or more on Mr J.R. Barkerâ€™s property at Baldina.  In his early life his dray, horse and several dogs were a familiar sight throughout the district.  Some droving trips took him as far away as Wentworth in NSW.  In more recent years the dray gave way to a motor vehicle and motor cycle.  He was a member of the RAOB Lodge.  He is survived by his widow, daughter Joan and son John and three grandchildren.  Also by three sisters and two brothers: Dorrie, Flora, Fan, Alf and Harry.  [Jack Birkenhagen Rowe born 21 January 1907 Redruth: died 12 July 1968 Burra.]
