Opening of the Tiddy ’Oggey Tearooms

A large crowd attended and there were stalls on the footpath.  There was a long queue waiting to buy the delicious Tiddy ’Oggies, scones with jam and cream.  There was a merry-go-round, morris dancing, hoop and skipping races, marbles and knuckle-throwing championships, music from the Roaring Jelly Band and folk singing from Don Griffen and Rob Zacher.

The official opening was by Mr John Burdett MLA, Minister for Community Welfare.

In the midst of it all some wild and woolly bushrangers led by Chris Hawke burst in with (cap) guns blazing and captured Ray Jennison for ransom.  After a couple of attempts to escape he was bound to a chair and the bushrangers demanded a home-made pasty ransom, releasing Ray on being suitably appeased.
