SA Mining Association held its half-yearly general meeting yesterday.  The Directors’ qualification was reduced from 20 shares to 11.  Charles Beck, having decided for the present to forego his intended trip to England, was re-elected Chairman of the Board of Directors.  The two new members of the Board are Mr Thomas Waterhouse and Mr Saunders.  On the whole the report is the most gratifying yet.  The prospects are that the next half-yearly report will be still more satisfactory.  The last £5 share to change hands did so at £158 cash.

Two hundred additional miners might most profitably be employed at the Burra Burra Mine.  This fact may account for the rumour that the SA Mining Association would postpone any developments at their newly acquired property at Emu Plains.
