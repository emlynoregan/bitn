The Goyder Sports & Community Centre proposed for Eudunda at a cost of $8.3 million has been stopped as a consequence of being rejected in a vote taken by the Eudunda community.  The elected members of the Goyder Council will now have to decide what form of any community centre will be constructed.  The planning for the $8.3 million dollar centre has cost many thousands of dollars.  The rejection occurred at a meeting chaired by Mayor Peter Mattey at which two questions were put to the Eudunda residents:

Do the Eudunda Ward electors approve of a Council loan or loans up to $2.5 million to assist in the cost of the proposed Goyder Sports and Community Centre and

Do the Eudunda Ward electors approve the reimbursement to Council by way of a levy on the future Eudunda Ward rates, of any financial shortfall, if any, in the construction and operation of the proposed Goyder Sports and Community Centre?

Mr Mattey acknowledged the hard work put in by the Eudunda Community Business & Tourism Committee (EC-BaT) and gave a balanced approach to the issue.  Then several people voiced their opinions for or against.  After an amendment requesting a secret ballot was passed it took more than an hour to conduct the proceedings.  A total of 292 voted with the results:

Question 1: 140 yes, 151 no and 1 informal.

Question2: 103 yes, 186 no and 3 informal.

RAG spokesperson, Helen Szuty, said the group was happy with the democratic process as the meeting.  She could not respond to questions about RAG at the meeting because she was not a Eudunda Ward elector, but stressed that Rag was in the process of becoming incorporated and welcomed members from all over the Goyder Council area.  She hoped that ECBaT would not be discouraged by the result, but would work to achieve more modest upgrades to community facilities.
