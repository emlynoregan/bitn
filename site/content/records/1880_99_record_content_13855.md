Burra Town Council, 21 July.

The Mayor said he had authorised the publication of the correspondence with the Salvation Army.

It was resolved to send copies of it and the memorial from the ratepayers to Major Thurman.

Council will have a special meeting in three weeks to consider framing a better by-law to meet the case.

Burra School Board of Advice sought a better footpath from Redruth to the school for the children.

The Council said, having no control over the ground, they could not expend rates there.

Mr Chenoweth and two others waited on the Council seeking work for the unemployed.

The mayor said it had done all it could to urge the beginning of the Waterworks, but another request will be sent.
