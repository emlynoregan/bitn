Weather.  The paper reports 117 points of rain so far for October.  This it says is for the past week, but does not include Saturday for some reason, even though the report of the show on the same page says it rained persistently.  Then in a postscript it adds that 15 points fell before 9 a.m. on Saturday and a further 36 points to 9 a.m. Monday.
