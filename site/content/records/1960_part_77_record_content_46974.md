Burra Mine

The MP, Hon. G.J. Gilfillan made a statement and asked a question in Parliament, of the Minister of Mines.  He said that previously the lage low grade deposit of copper ore at Burra had been considered too expensive to treat to be a viable operation.  Now further experiments had taken place.  He asked: ‘Can the Minister say whether sufficient progress has been made to make the extraction of such ore a commercial proposition?’

The Hon. R.C. DeGaris confirmed the problem and said a process called the Glyserol Process had been shown by CSIRO to work in the laboratory.  The Government is examining the process at the Australian Mineral Development Laboratories to see if it is practical as a commercial operation and results are awaited.
