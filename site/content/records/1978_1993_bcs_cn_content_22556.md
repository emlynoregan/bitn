John William Burge

I have lived all but three years of my life in the Farrell Flat area, working on a farm and taking a keen interest in local affairs and serving on local committees.  I have been Secretary of the Hall Committee for many years, 23 years on the Farrell Flat CFS, 20 years as Council Representative on the Clare Hospital Board and 17 years representing the Farrell Flat Ward on the Burra Burra DC, where I served on the Works Committee and Weeds Board.  I am a Life Member of the Hanson-Burra Agricultural Bureau and was chairman for a number of years.  I am a member of and trustee of  St Mary’s Anglican Church.  At present we are in challenging times with dwindling or even negative primary incomes and this will present the Council with difficult decisions.  I look forward to the challenge.
