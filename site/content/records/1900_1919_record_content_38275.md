Local Board of Health

Letter received from the Hospital Board re the Mayor’s position as above.

Nurse Woollacott’s Maternity Home licence renewed.

[Cr Wicklein and Cr Walker had an exchange about pepper trees at the Burra Hotel which would appear likely to carry information between the lines.

‘Cr Wicklein: Have you ever been over there.

Cr Walker: Not inside.

Cr Wicklein said he often had occassion [sic] to go over with a traveller and that was how he knew.’]
