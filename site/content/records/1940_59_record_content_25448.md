A Welcome Home was accorded five returned men at the Burra Town Hall last Friday evening.  The Mayor hobbled onto the stage, having recently broken his foot.

The returned men were:

FO Alan Walker, who had spent 2½ years in England.

Cpl Peter Williams (RAAF), who spent a long time in the Islands after being farewelled four years ago.

Pte Ben Kotz, who had been in the Owen Stanley Ranges and in a lot worse places in the Islands since then.

Pte O’Connor, who came from Mt Bryan and was given a hearty welcome.

Flt-Lt Secker, who was not really a Burra boy, but had lately commenced business here, having seen five or six years service in the RAAF.

The Mayor said he was disappointed with the deal returned men were getting.  With some 6,000 of them out of work something was wrong.  Most factories were advertising for girls, yet thousands of boys who were seeking light jobs could not get one.  He wanted a flax factory in the district.  Of 400 recent advertisements in the Advertiser only sixty had called for boys.  He also made comments on soldiers acquiring land.

[As previously noted in this issue.]

Mr R.H. Smith spoke for the RSL and so did Mr H.J.B. Jennison as local Rehabilitation Officer.  After reading some bitter comments from returned men, he wanted them to know that people were prepared to help them, but they needed to tell of their requirements before he could help.
