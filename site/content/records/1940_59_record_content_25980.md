Centenary Profits

Legal advice is that the profits from the Burra Centenary Celebrations must be spent on a swimming pool.  To change this:

Consent would be needed from all who contributed, which is impossible.

Or by an Act of Parliament, which is impracticable.

Or by an Order of the SA Supreme Court, which would be expensive.
