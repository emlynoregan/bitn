The half-yearly meting of the Burra Company was held yesterday.   We have much pleasure in calling attention to the favourable account given of the different workings of these celebrated mines.

In the last six months 5,600 tons or ore have been raised.  There was also 4,440 tons on hand, which had been raised at the date of the previous half-yearly meeting.  In the half-year 3,813 tons of ore had been exported for sale and delivered to the Smelting Co.  There are 6,068 tons of ore on hand.  Ore sold in the past half-year is supposed to average 24%.  Captain Roach’s report suggests that not only is it likely the present workings will be continued, but also that new lodes of valuable ore will be found.  The various pitches seem without exception to be yielding good quantities of ore and the application of new machinery will further increase productiveness.

758 persons are now directly employed at the Burra Mines, of whom 385 are miners, 200 are ore dressers, 113 are labourers, 47 are mechanics and engine drivers and 13 are officers.  These figures exclude those employed at the new Karkulto Mine.  The Directors lament the fall of £18-10-0 per ton in the price of copper on the English market.  This will affect not only the ore on hand in SA, but also that held by London agents an at sea.  This sudden decline has led the Directors to say that in all probability they will not be able to pay a dividend on 1 December.  This said, it is well to recall that the price of copper at £107-10-0 per ton was exceedingly high and a decline should not come as a surprise.  The increasing productiveness of the mine partially offsets this loss.    Despite the fall in copper prices the undistributed profits are £62,000.
