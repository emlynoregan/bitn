Unusual Accident.  A semi-trailer driver attempted a U-turn in Commercial Street the other day near Elders.  The trailer became suspended on the crown of the road and was unable to go either forwards or backwards.  It was eventually pulled off the obstacle when Reece van Gasteren hooked his vehicle to a section of the trailer.
