Burra Caravan Park with its facilities on the north side of the swimming pool is expected to be sufficiently advanced to allow its opening over the Easter weekend.  Work on the amenities block is advancing with plumbing almost completed and electric wiring installed and ready for connection.  Concreting of floors and plastering is under way.  Painting may not be completed in time for Easter, but that would not prevent use.  The park will be completed for a cost of $6,000 and is eligible for a $3,000 subsidy from the SA Government Tourist Bureau.
