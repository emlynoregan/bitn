Editorial.  The local St John volunteers do a great job, but when a casualty needs to go to Adelaide they get a bill or around $740 â€“ quite a hefty amount considering there is no labour cost involved.  When the hospital transfers someone they too get a hefty bill.  A few years ago many country areas ran their own ambulance service and the local boards ran a tight ship.  It is time we looked at the economics of a private ambulance service looking after the district.
