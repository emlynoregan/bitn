From Byles’ discovery claim 1,166 tons 11cwt were put through and the total yield of the field was 3,569oz of which Byles’ claim put through 1,894oz.  Total value without the gold premium was £14,184.  Since Byles’ GM was formed over £14,000 has been returned to the company.  During the control of the syndicate total gold production was 467oz from 79 tons.  The syndicate spent £1,000 in wages and since the formation of the company £5,929 has been paid in wages, not including salaries.  Twenty-seven miners are employed by the Mongolata Co. while 110 are at work on the field.  The company’s wages bill is £200 a fortnight and last March it paid a 6d dividend with a similar payment expected in June.  The gold averages 22 carat bringing about 5/- more per ounce than the standard gold.  The gold from Baldina Mine on the same field shows the highest value gold in the world according to a Government expert.  The directors George Milne, Archie Thornton, Doug Reid, Isaac Warnes and James Daly are all well known South Australians.
