[XV, 532, 24 Sep. 1902, page 3

An Earth Tremor struck Burra on Thursday at 6.45 a.m. and rattled stuff on shelves.  On Friday at 8.15 p.m. a second and more serious earthquake shook the town and seemed worse at Kooringa than in Redruth.  Some crockery was broken in falling from shelves and a large pane in one window shattered.  People ran into the streets and some stayed outside all night.  Part of a ceiling collapsed where a woman had been sitting till a moment before.  At the Institute a performance of Marionettes was not interrupted, apparently the audience was so rapt in the performance.  There was a sound like thunder which seemed to travel from west to east.  There was a third slight tremor on Sunday afternoon.]
