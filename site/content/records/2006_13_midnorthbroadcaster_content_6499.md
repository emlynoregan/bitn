Burra Sing Australia Choir were recently joined by Sing Australia ‘Blokes’ Choir of Canberra and the Glenelg Sing Australia Choir for an impromptu performance in Market Square.  The ‘Blokes Tour’ led by Chris McPhail has taken them around SA.  There was also a short performance from the stage of the Burra Town Hall.  Later members of the Sing Australia Choirs from Burra, Peterborough, Pt Pirie, Pt Augusta and Laura came together at Peterborough for an evening of song, music and dance with an excellent dinner provided by the Peterborough Rotary Club at which the Founding Director of Sing Australia, Colin Slater, was the MC.
