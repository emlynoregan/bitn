The Literary Supplement.

This has not been preserved in the hard copy and scarcely in the microfilm.  Whether it continued beyond February is not at all clear.

The microfilm version contains the following:

Date	Poetry	Stories	Gen. Interest Items	Household Hints	Recipes	Humour

14 Jan.	X	Two Wild Wagers	X	X	X

Revenge!

Dr Hoknagel’s Strange Story

(by Julian Hawthorne)

21Jan.	X	The Van Renselaer Ghost	X	X	X

(by Ellen V. Talbot)

Sentence Suspended

11 Feb.	X	The Rajah’s Vengeance	X	X	X

A Story of India

(by Frederick M. Dey)

An Artful Woman

18 Feb.	X	The Rajah’s Vengeance	X	X	X	X

(Continued)

The Short Path

(by Zu Befehl)

Her Husband’s Letter

25 Feb.			X			X

Note.  The last supplement seen on 25 February was a very different issue from the others.  It was a much smaller sheet and very different in both format and content.  It is the only one preserved in that format
