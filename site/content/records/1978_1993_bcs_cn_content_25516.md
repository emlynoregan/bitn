Kevin W. Wallis

Resident of Burra for seven years.  Married to Barbara and have three sons, Lee, Adam and Brett.  Since moving here I have been self employed in the mining industry and am an active member of the Burra Community.  I spent two years on the committee of the Burra Mine Museum and am an active member of the Burra Pistol Club.  My interests in being on Council include the establishment of a waste management scheme and implementation of a recycling depot.  I am committed to the development of Burra as a safe and attractive place to raise children and the promotion of varied employment opportunities for its occupants.  I am well aware of the historical and heritage importance of Burra to SA and the need to proceed with tourism and development with informed debate.
