Colleen Yvonne Woodgate

Married to Ashley Woodgate and have five children and five grandchildren.  Currently a member of the Community School Council, the Library Board, the Ambulance Board and the Boarding House Committee.  I am on the Booborowie Primary School Committee and the Booborowie Soldiers’ Memorial Hall Committee, and President of the Booborowie Women’s Bowling Club.  Local government is at times a frustrating and time consuming business with an increasing involvement in human services from other tiers of government.  We continue to endeavour to improve the road network, clean up, contain rates and provide services.  The 1990s will offer a bigger challenge, which I intend to meet head on to the best of my ability.
