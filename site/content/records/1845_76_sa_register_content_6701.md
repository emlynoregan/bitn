Police Court, Kooringa, W. Lang Resident Magistrate, 11 June.

George Tisoc charged J.S. Barnett for the balance of wages due when he was dismissed without notice.  There was at issue the question of whether Tisoc’s second month of employment was the result of a second contract or a continuation of the first, which had allowed dismissal without notice.  Mr Lang ruled that Tisoc was entitled to be paid for the time served and 30/- towards his expenses in returning to Adelaide.

Betsy James proved a case of affiliation against Thomas Moyle, sawyer of Kooringa.  The Bench ordered that Moyle pay £5-5-0 for the complainant’s expenses during her confinement, 26/- court costs and 2/6 a week for the support of the child.

William Blair, baker, summonsed James Taylor of the Aberdeen Hotel for two month’s wages.  Mr Fitzgerald, for Blair, said his client had an agreement to serve Taylor for 12 months at 30/- per week for the first four months and 40/- per week, with flour and bread for his use, for the last 8 months.  He was suing for 8 weeks, being the time actually served.  Taylor claimed Blair had misappropriated flour and the case was adjourned for further evidence.

Turton Diprose, stockholder, obtained a summons against Joseph Jones for the illegal possession of a sow valued at £3, property of Diprose.

Turton Diprose, stockholder, obtained a summons against John Hawking to recover £1 for damage done by Hawking’s dog to a heifer belonging to Diprose.  [When settled on 18 June the name is cited as Hawkins.]

12 June

The case of Blair v. Taylor was referred to arbitration.

13 June

Pollard and Thomas, draymen sought advice.  They had been engaged by Mr Young of Watervale to deliver five dray-loads (c. 8 tons) to Mr Richardson in Kooringa.  Mr Young was to meet them on arrival, but he failed to do so and Richardson refused to take delivery because the hay was wet.  His Worship advised them to contact Young immediately and to keep the hay in safe custody.  They asked if they would have a claim on Young for the time their drays were delayed.  He said yes.

14 June

Captain Bath pf the Princess Royal Mine appeared to answer the summons of Thomas Rosewall for £7-19-6 being the balance of wages due in respect of ore raised and dressed February to May 1850.  The argument depended on a deal of technical mining practice and eventually the Bench ruled that the defendant would pay the plaintiff £5-17-0 and each party would pay its own expenses.  The company was given till next Monday to pay.
