Burra Institute held its AGM on 31 January after a postponement due to lack of numbers.  A committee was elected.  President W. Carpenter presented the annual report.  The grant for 1960 was £64-15-4 and subscriptions were £138-7-7.  This is down due to removals from the town and the impact of television.  Expenses amounted to £179-19-11, leaving a credit balance of £39-3-4.  There were 6.963 books in the library.  Present membership is 106 adults and 20 juveniles.  The scholarships for students have been discontinued because the schools now have good libraries.  The librarian Mrs Steer continues to give excellent service.
