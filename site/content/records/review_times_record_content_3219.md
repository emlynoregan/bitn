Redbanks

A 150 ha site in Redbanks Reserve has been earmarked as SAâ€™s first fully-managed off-road recreational vehicle area for a two year trial period, following a study by the Department of Environment & Planning.  Recreation & Sports Minister Mr Kym Mayes announced this last week.  If the experiment is successful it would lead to a network of ORRV reserves across the state.  The 150 ha area is part of the 1,000 ha Redbanks Reserve.  It will be leased to the Burra Burra DC, which will set up a committee to manage ORRV activity at the site.  This particular part of the reserve does not contain features of environmental significance.  Public submissions on the proposal should be sent to Mr Ian Trestrail of the Department of Recreation & Sport.
