Burra Cemetery.

A recent meeting of the Town Council decide to put on extra labour to clean up the cemetery.

‘Casual Sunday afternoon strolls in the cemetery are entirely out of good taste.’

‘For health, propriety, and many other reasons, it would perhaps be better it were not thrown open so publicly.’

The ground now enclosed is rapidly becoming crowded, but it is pleasing to know that the council, who are the trustees, have secured more land, and we would like to notice steps being taken to get the wall extended so that the whole of the land might be all compact.
