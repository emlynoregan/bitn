Burra Burra Copper Co.  It is stated on good authority that J.M. McBride offered to give the mine £5,000 and have an interest in the mine if the directors would only do their part, but even this did not have any effect on the management.  [The words ‘give’ and ‘have an interest’ would need clarification before one could make a reasonable judgement about this.]
