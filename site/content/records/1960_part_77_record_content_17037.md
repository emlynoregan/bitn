Burra Bowling Club held its AGM 17 July and elected: Patron, Guy Dollman; President, D. Jacka; Vice-Presidents, Messrs J.B. Topsfield & C. Leslie Phillips; Secretary, Mr Darrell Field, Treasurer, B. Riggs and Greens Manager, W.G. Terry.

Plans for the immediate future include lighting the two northern greens (with cost to be considered) and the lining of the men’s section of the clubhouse with Gyprock.  The President reported a very active year in which Burra Gold won the pennant in the Mid North Association and the Blue team were runners-up in the North Eastern association.  Associate Members were a tower of strength and donated £250 to the improvement debenture fund and gave great help in the Easter Tournament.  Membership was 61 plus 12 night members.  The debenture scheme to finance a new toilet block was oversubscribed.  General finances are sound.
