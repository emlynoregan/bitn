Burra Mine.  Before resigning as Government Geologist, Mr H.Y.L. Brown stated that the Burra Mine was worth working, though the company thought otherwise.  Mr Davis, who was in Burra for the Bewick Moring people some time ago, thought it worthwhile when copper was anything over £60 a ton.  On Wednesday copper was quoted at £64-5-0 a ton.
