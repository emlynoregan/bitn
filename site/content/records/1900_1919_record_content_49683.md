‘Horatio Copperhouse’ writes that on the day of the seaside trip he and others decided to picnic at the Recreation Ground, but on arrival found the four iron gates all locked and the sole occupant of the grounds to be ‘the Municipal Horse [which] was fast asleep’. 

‘One gentleman who was present recklessly leaned against the gate and the chain, which was about the same age as the horse, gave way at its weakest link and lo, the way was open before us.’

‘We entered the forbidden ground, careful not to disturb the poor old horse, which, considering the present exorbitant price of meat must have been worth at least 3s 9d.’

He considered arrangements for access could be made on future such occasions.
