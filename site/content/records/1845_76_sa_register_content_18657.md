Kooringa News, 15 June

Many are still going to Wallaroo, but they are chiefly those going to join their families.  Several have returned from there, finding the place overstocked with miners.

Sheep farmers here are complaining of lack of rain.

Accident.  John Killicoat had a fortunate escape from harm recently.  He was on his horse and had just received his gun to shoot crows.  In holding it by the stock he did not notice that the key which fastens the stock and barrel together was not in its proper place.  As a consequence the barrel fell and went off.  The contents lodged in the bowels of the horse about eight or nine inches behind the riderâ€™s foot.  The valuable horse had to be put down.

Rev. Stanton has resumed duties after his accident.
