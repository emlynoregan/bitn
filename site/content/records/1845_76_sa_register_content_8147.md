Proposed Aid for Unsuccessful Diggers

We cannot agree with proposals to send several vessels at public expense to bring home unsuccessful diggers from Melbourne.  No doubt hundreds would avail themselves of the opportunity.  It has been said that they are needed in SA for shearing and harvest.  Many such workers are of unsettled pursuits and habitation.  While some may have made their fortunes and withdrawn from the labouring class, a knowledge of the habits of the greater number suggests that they have wasted or will waste the fruit of their exertions as fast as they made it.  We think that this class of men could be lured by to SA with the guarantee of employment, the employer guaranteeing the cost of passage.  This could be arranged through the services of the SA Commissioner at the diggings, the labourer undertaking to work on subsistence until the passage money had been repaid.   This is no different in principal from engagements made every day in Adelaide.
