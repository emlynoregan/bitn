On 6 September we helped the Red Cross raise funds through a Paddy’s Market and again on 13 September with their general appeal in Adelaide when the band marched through the city.  Here we bought a Union Jack on the Bugler system for £64, being the highest quota from the Burra Cheer-up Society and also took part in the War Tank Demonstration on Unley Oval.

On 10 October we aided the Burra Sporting and Athletic Club with luncheon and on 30 October at Navy Day in Burra we provided luncheon and afternoon tea and donated £25 to the day’s appeal and £20 to the Adelaide Cheer-up Hut as Anzacs were arriving home on furlough after four year’s service.  The ladies Band combined with the Naval Band to provide music.

22 November at the RSA [i.e. RSL] Fete we ran the sweets stall and at America Day on 29 November we raised £8-11-6.

December 6th’s Gift Stall when we received gifts for the Adelaide Hut was not so very successful and only three cases of goods resulted.

In February we donated 12 good chairs for the RSL Club Rooms.

7 March was Preserve Gift Day and £50 worth of goods was sent to Aid the Adelaide Cheer-up Hut.

In the last 12 months 16 socials were held for soldiers and nurses and 76 soldiers and nurses received Cheer-up parcels, mostly at the socials.

Since May 1918 we have sent 121 pairs of socks, 7 scarves, 7 pairs of mittens, 2 balaclavas and 1 pair of knee pads to Lady Brown.

We have a wonderful gallery of photos of the nurses, soldiers and one sailor who enlisted from Burra and District.

The Burra Cheer-up Ladies Band under Bandmaster James Bentley has been busy and much sought after, assisting in all patriotic efforts in Burra and at many elsewhere.  From 4 December 1918 to 15 May 1919 the band played on 36 evenings to greet soldiers at the railway station.  (No accurate record exists for the period before 4 December 1918.)  On 24 May 1918 the band played in Adelaide in aid of the YMCA.  Pt Pirie was visited on 1-3 June1918 also to aid the YMCA and they played at Crystal Brook station on the way home.    In July they played at Hallett.  On 13 September 1918 they again played in Adelaide to aid the Red Cross in an impressive and unique procession where they marched immediately behind Lady Galway and the Committee.  On 18 September 1918 they played at Clare for Australia Day.  On 28 September they played at the opening of the Burra Boy Scouts Hall and also in September at the Burra Sporting and Athletic Club’s effort and they travelled to Mt Bryan in October.

They were present at about 9.30 p.m. when the Armistice was announced on 11 November 1918 and at the next morning’s thanksgiving service in Market Square before leaving that afternoon to play at the Women’s Demonstration of Welcome to the grand old French soldier General Pau* and his mission.  Here they headed a big procession from the Hut to the Exhibition [Building].  They then travelled north on the same train as the General and farewelled him with The Marseillaise on the Burra platform.  On 16 November they visited Leighton and on the 20th went to Mintaro.  Invitations to a host of SA country towns had to be declined as well as some to Adelaide.

Thanks go to Walter Pearce for driving the girls to the station so often, to J. Pearce for use of the Cheer-up Room, to E.J. Harris for the loan of crockery and to all those who drove cars for the convenience of returning soldiers and to E.F. Marston for space in the Record to report the society’s activities.

[*General Paul Marie César Gérald Pau was born in 1848 and had lost one arm in action before WWI. He was a veteran of the Franco-Prussian War.  Early in the war he commanded French forces at Montpellier and then in Upper Alsace along the Vosges and on the Meurthe.]
