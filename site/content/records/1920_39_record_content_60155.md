Gold.  In 1935, in response to rising prices, the SA production of gold went up.  25.6% came from privately operated batteries and 43.4% from Government batteries and cyanide works.  The remainder came from prospecting and mining across SA.  Of the Government batteries 19.2% came from Mt Torrens, 5.2% from Peterborough, 37.3% from Mongolata, 32.2% from Tarcoola and 6.1% from Glenloth, which only began operations in October 1935.  The peak year for gold in SA was 1904 â€“ mainly due to the discovery of gold at Tarcoola in 1900.  (From the Advertiser 19 February.)
