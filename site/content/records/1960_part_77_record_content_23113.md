The Smelts Chimney.  After the reference last issue to a chap named Lewis climbing the Smelts Chimney, we have been advised by W. Voumard, who saw the incident, that it was a lad named ‘Pudden’ Jordan.

[See Burra Record 57, 45, 10 Nov. 1936, page 3: Memories of Burra by Elizabeth A. Ward.  Arthur Jordan was at the time a schoolboy of 12 years of age, son of the late J.D. Jordan, watchmaker, of Kooringa.  He was still alive at the time of this article: Arthur Dawson Jordan born 8 March 1873 Kooringa: died 28 October 1965, Gawler.  See also 88, 5 (4), 9 Feb. 1965, page 6.]
