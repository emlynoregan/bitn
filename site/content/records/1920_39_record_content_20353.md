Cr Kellaway moved to rescind the motion of Cr Riggs about the monument enclosure of 20ft x 45ft oblong because an enclosure of this size would be dangerous.

There was dissent over whether it was appropriate to proceed in the matter in the absence of Cr Riggs and eventually the question was deferred to the next meeting.

Cr Kellaway then gave further notice to rescind the motion that the work of enclosure be proceeded with.
