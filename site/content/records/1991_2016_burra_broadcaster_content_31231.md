Goyder Council is preparing costings and a report on sealing the Bower Boundary Road.  This connects the Morgan-Burra Road with the Morgan-Eudunda Road.  It provides a link to abattoirs at Murray Bridge and Pt Wakefield and its sealing is regarded as vital to the development of the intensive animal industries and other primary industries in the Bower area.  One major pig producer has been established and two additional development applications are being considered.  The area could potentially accommodate up to 53 enterprises, with 23 being in the Regional Council of Goyder.  The Minister for transport does not support the project when money has recently been spent on sealing the parallel Burra-Robertstown Road.
