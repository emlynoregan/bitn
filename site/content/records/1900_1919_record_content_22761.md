A near drowning.  Two little girls named McGowan fell into the Burra Creek on Friday from a footbridge, when a couple of foolish boys shook the planks.  Mr Rundle, the postmaster, saved the life of one by wading in after her.  He was assisted by Mr John Harry.  The older sister fell near the edge and was assisted out by Miss Pearce who was close at hand.  Mr Seabury got a trap and drove the girls home to Hampton.
