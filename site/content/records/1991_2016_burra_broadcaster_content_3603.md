Burra Show Society

The AGM was held last Tuesday.  Mr Rick Williams was elected President for the coming year, replacing Mr Andrew McGuinness, who did not seek re-election due to work commitments, but who agreed to take the position of Senior Vice-President.  Mrs Pam Shipard is Junior Vice-President with Mrs Jean Jameison as Secretary.  The Show Society and Pony Club have already planted 500 trees and hope to plant a further 500 shortly.
