Mr H. Picken of Victoria writes to complain of loutish behaviour in the Caravan Park.  A utility was driven at speed close to their caravan at about 9.30 p.m. and in doing so wrenched the power lead from the van.  His wife picked it up before noticing the plug had been torn off and the live wires were protruding.  She was lucky to escape electrocution.
