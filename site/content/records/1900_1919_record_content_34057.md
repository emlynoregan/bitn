I.J. Warnes v. Morgan Bros.  Warnes was seeking £20 damages for trespass.

The argument was over the right of the occupier to deny travelling stock access to a dam or dams in which he was trying to conserve water in a drought.  There had been a Government dam within easy walking distance for the stock.

The evidence extends for c. 1⅔ columns and resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff of £7-10-0 + costs.  The plaintiff gave the damages, less expenses, to the Burra Hospital, having no desire to make money out of the affair.
