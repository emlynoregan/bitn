Georgia Heath.  Born in Hobart.  Married to Neville Hyde and have two sons: Oliver (3½) and John Gabriel (1).  Studied at the School of Art in Hobart and gained a BA in Graphic Design.  A varied employment history including restaurant work and teaching.  Currently studying Children’s Book Illustration by correspondence with TAFE.  Interested in herbs and their uses.  Burra has many artisans and crafts people and it needs to be promoted for both its history and its living talents.  Standing for Council because I believe there needs to be a greater cross-section of the community represented.
