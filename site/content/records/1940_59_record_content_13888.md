Hon. R.S. Richards Leader of the Opposition in SA visited Burra with the endorsed Labor candidate for Wakefield Mr A.E. Smith last Wednesday.  The meeting at the Burra Institute Lodge Room was poorly attended.  The Mayor presided.  Mr Smith attacked the city press for criticising whatever the Labor Government did.  John Curtin had saved Australia by bringing the AIF back and bringing the Americans to this country.  Mr Richards accused the UAP of not keeping the unwritten agreement to cease political strife for the duration.  He also accused the daily press of distorting his statements against Senator McLeay.  Australia had organised her manpower.  Prior to the Curtain Government there had been no set plan to evacuate cities, for the storage of food, or for accommodation.  Taxes had to rise to cover the cost of war.  Senator McLeay says 4/- per bushel for wheat (which is what 70% of farmers get) is not enough, yet when he was in power 2/6 was generous.
