Frank Fennell celebrated 25 years with Jennison’s Tyre Service with a barbecue at the Golf Clubhouse on 24 October.  Mt Ray Jennison presented him with a cheque and a gold watch.  Frank is 57 and originally came from Robe.  He first came to Burra as a shearer and worked in the area for 17 years.  He then worked for the Burra Burra DC for three years before joining Jennison’s.  In the early days there he and Mr Jennison had worked on fridges and televisions as well as tyres.  Mr Fennell will continue to work in the business, which has recently been sold to Ron & Geraldine Smedley.  The new business will be known as Burra Tyres.  He said that the recent fire at the store had speeded up Mr Jennison’s decision to sell the business and retire to Port Vincent to enjoy fishing and golf.
