Burra Show was held last Friday and was very successful.  Despite a pleasant start, cold intermittent showers spoiled the afternoon, but by then the crowd had come in record numbers and the gate took almost £90.

There was a fine display of dairy produce in which E.N. Finch was the most successful.

Poultry as usual was very good.

Draught horses had improved.

Cattle as usual were few.

Dogs were as good as usual and more coursing activity has resulted in over 30 greyhounds being exhibited.

Sheep numbers were down due to the dry weather, but quality was good.

Chin Young scored heavily in amateur vegetables, though it makes one wonder what constitutes ‘professional’.

E.N. Finch won the wheat prize.

R. Fuss won 50 prizes from 72 entries in the flowers.

The complete prize list is printed.
