Election Meeting at the Institute

Mr Moody: Independent.

He supported the State Bank. He probably supported household suffrage, though the report in the paper is not very clear.  He supported Bundaleer and the Barossa water schemes.

[The reporting of this speech is poor as on several topics we get a statement without any indication of whether he was opposed or supportive.]

Mr Russell.

He favoured a £15 franchise and would support any bill for a reduction of the franchise for the Legislative Council.  Eleven out of twenty-four Legislative Councillors were squatters!  He was for a progressive taxation system, but opposed to any increase in land tax.  He favoured closer settlement and for early closing in Adelaide, but not in the country.

Mr Pascoe.

He was against household suffrage for the Legislative Council.  It was not a question, he said, of ability, but of stability.  He thought the number of members should be reduced by at least one third.  He favoured closer settlement.  He opposed the Employers’ Liability Bill, was for early closing and against increased land taxes.  He thought village settlements were started on the wrong lines.
