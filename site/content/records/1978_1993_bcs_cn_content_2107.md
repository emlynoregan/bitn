Bon Accord Social and Welfare Club

This was formed on 8 October 1979 when 39 members were listed.

The object is to promote the social enjoyment of members and to donate funds to local sporting bodies and members’ welfare.  The club’s income comes through the sale of vending and beer tickets, raffles and membership, etc.  To the last meeting income had been £3,324.10 and expenditure to date had been $1,551.60 plus the following donations:

Ladies’ Netball	$50

Men’s Basketball	$50

Pistol Club	$100

Leighton Cricket Club	$150

Burra Darts Club	$150

Tennis Club	$150

Burra Cricket Club	      $150

Total	$2,351.60

$150 was also donated to an injured cricketer to bring the total to $2,501.50

[Sic: though on the above information this should be $2,501.60.]

This leaves a total of $822.50.

Current membership is 46.  The Secretary is Brian Burchell.
