Goyder Regional Council has donated two hectares of land near Burra to the Russian Molokan Christian Community for use as burial plots.  The Community believes that once a member is buried the ground must remain undisturbed for eternity.  Most cemeteries in SA have leases of between 50 and 99 years.  The Community was seeking land for an estimated 500 burials by the end of this century.  The Council recently decided to transfer ownership of assessment A51390 (CT277/138) in the Hundred of Bright to the Russian Molokan Community.
