Burra Primary School Committee held its AGM on 20 March.  It drew only 25 parents and 9 teachers.  Chairman Mr Charles O’Connor welcomed them.  Elected: Chairman, Charles O’Connor; Vice-Chairman, Ian Allen and Secretary-Treasurer, Lewis Moore.

[The Chairman reported on sports activities and fundraising for the past year.]

The triangular area directly in front of the school has been unsightly for many years.  In 1971 the area was ploughed, levelled and treated with gypsum and sown to lawn.  Thanks go especially to Murray Tiver for dealing with the ploughing and working and to others who were involved.  The water supply to the school was improved with much increased water pressure and an efficiently functioning fire hydrant after many years.  The new classroom was completed in mid-1971 and has been an important addition to the school.  The Department has approved the enlargement of the area at the back of the tennis court.  The walkway to Burra North is now an easement and work on it should begin soon.  We welcome three new teachers for 1972 in Miss Lester, Miss Williams and Mr Good.
