Obituary.  Edward Benney was working at the Queen Mine in Zeehan at Chalmer’s and Benney’s tribute and was commencing to put up a rise near the end of the drive when several tons of debris pinned him to the ground and death must have been instantaneous.  He was buried after a large funeral two days later with over 1,000 people in the procession.  The Cornish Carol Choir sang three old Cornish Hymns on the way, assisted by the Wesleyan Choir.  [Further details are printed.]
