Burra Golf Associates held their AGM last Wednesday and elected: President, Di Day; Vice-Presidents, Dot Huxtable & Sylvia Pohlner; Secretary, Di Bernhardt; Assistant Secretary, Lesley Gosse; Treasurer, Mandy Wenzel, Captain, Rose Duncan and Vice-Captain, Lyn Mosey.

The highlight of a successful year was hosting the SALGU Bronze Salver in July.  The week was a great success.  In the pennant competition Burra finished 3rd this year.

Championship winners for the year were Joyce, Jo and Lesley.

[Surnames unspecified but perhaps Lloyd, ? and Gosse.]

[There is also a long list of people who are thanked for their input for the year.]
