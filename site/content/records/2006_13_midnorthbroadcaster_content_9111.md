Burra Town Hall has had some 7,400 visitors, with 1,418 in the last month alone.  Thanks go to the committee members and especially to Roy Taplin for his painstaking attention to maintenance and restoration.  In the past year improvements have included the installation of the Mayoral and Australia Day Boards in the Civic Room and the completion of the collection of former Mayors’ photographs.  These were presented to the Town Hall Committee by the Burra History Group.  An alarm was installed in the Civic Room and the silver emu egg inkstand presented to the first Mayor [Philip Lane,] on loan from the National Trust, has been placed there.  Also on display is the silver trowel used to lay the building’s foundation stone.  Insulation was placed in the Mary Warnes room and the dressing rooms and their toilets were restored.  Dress-up clothes have been placed there and have provided many people, both young and old, with some fun and memorable photographs.  The kitchen has been painted and a new floor covering laid.  The Burra Masonic Lodge honour board of former Worshipful Masters has been placed in the History Room.  The hall is open to the public most days from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. [When not booked for functions.]  The Hall could use some more volunteers to welcome visitors when it is open, so anyone with a spare two hours a week would be appreciated.  Contact Meredith Satchell.  The Hall is managed by the Burra Community Development Programme Inc. and its committee for 2009 comprises: President, Meredith Satchell; Vice-President, Darryl Venning; Secretary, Brenda Taplin; Treasurer & Booking Officer, John Fuss; Committee Members, Robert Reed, Pauline Venning, Roy Taplin and Murray Tiver.
