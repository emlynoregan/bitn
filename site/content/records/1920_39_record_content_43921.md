Mongolata Goldfield

Four men who have been prospecting unsuccessfully for three months are appealing for clothes and boots or shoes.  There is no fund that can supply these within Burra.

Rev. A.E. Davies showed pictures at the Kooringa Methodist Lecture Hall on Monday 14 November in aid of Minda Home, but drew only a meagre audience.  On Tuesday a somewhat larger audience attended the Redruth Memorial Hall.  The home is very short of funds this year on account of the depression.
