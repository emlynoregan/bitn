Obituary.  Mr George Theuff died at Quondong on 23 December.  [Registered as born George Herbert Theeuf 27 December 1865.]

A telegram was sent to his mother on 24 December from Mannahill, to which a messenger rode over 50 miles to convey the sad news.  Mr Theuff had lived for many years in Burra before going to Broken Hill where he married Miss Titcombe.  After several years he got a position nearer home and accepted that of manager for Mr H. Scott on his Quondong Station, where he has been for the last 2½ years.  The Wednesday mail brought details.  On 23 December he and his brother Charles and another man went to rectify problems with a pump at a well.  The deceased had been down the well before and decided to go again.  He was lowered in a bucket.  One knock was to denote a safe arrival at 225’ and 4 was the signal to haul up.  The one knock was heard and noises in the pipe gave the impression work was proceeding.  After 10 minutes with no sound being heard they hauled him up.  When they could see the deceased he had one leg in the bucket and his body hanging over.  He was brought to the surface much disfigured and the body was taken to the house in the evening as the heat was intense and the distance some 7 miles.  Charles Theuff had to make a coffin and the deceased was buried there in the presence of his wife, brother and two station hands.  He was a devoted husband, a loving father and a good son.  He was a staunch adherent of the Salvation Army.  Police deemed an inquest unnecessary.
