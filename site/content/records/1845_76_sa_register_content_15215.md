Kooringa News, 11 December

Mr J.H. Clark delivered a lecture on Douglas Jerrold at the Burra Institute on Monday evening.  The attendance was not such as to encourage a gentleman who had travelled from Adelaide to deliver the address.  Rev. W. Davidson chaired the meeting.

The teachers and scholars of the Kooringa Wesleyan Sunday School presented a handsome testimonial to Mr J. Skews on Sunday afternoon upon his resigning as secretary due to his promotion to the ministry.

On Monday there was a tea meeting held to celebrate the opening of a place of worship in connection with the Wesleyan Church on the outskirts of the township.  It and the following public meeting were well attended.

The Annual Bible Christian Bazaar was opened on Monday in an unoccupied store adjoining Mr T. Richardâ€™s.
