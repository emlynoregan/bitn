Cricket

Burra Footballers 151 & 7 for 121 defeated Mt Bryan 121

For Burra Footballers J. Bogisch took 6 for 40 including a hat trick.

Booborowie 150 defeated Koonaburra 128

Hallett 138 & 30 (168) defeated North Booborowie 55 & 106 (161).  [But the paper also says scores were level!  The report does not cite the extras and so runs cannot be totalled to clarify this.  Bowling figures cited also fail to make sense.]
