George H. Harmer of Clare writes contradicting the statement at the Burra Council meeting alleging Burra meat prices were high.  The prices quoted were 8d lb in Clare and 1/- lb in Burra, but in Clare the 8d refers only to the lowest quality meat and is misleading.  Actually prices in Clare are Beef 8d to 1/- lb, Mutton 8 d to 11d lb and Lamb 9d to 11d lb.
