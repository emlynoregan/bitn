Trip to Robertstown. `A Farmer' challenged the correspondent's version of the trip, claiming the crops are better than stated and that the World's End P.O. is less than a quarter mile from the main road and receives 60-70 letters a month and 30-40 newspapers. Spring Hut water is brackish and the oats cited were rye. [The correspondent replied that it had rained since: his trip and crops had undoubtedly picked up and he could but rely on local reports of the water quality.]
