Burra National Trust has proposed that it lease the Council’s heritage sites – Hampton, the Brewery Cellars, Smelts Paddock and the Tourist Information Centre – and also takes on responsibility for the Heritage Trail and Passport.  Council has suggested a lease of $10 per site per year, payable on demand.  The National Trust would be responsible for rates, taxes, power, water and maintenance.  Council has offered to assist with a payment towards the cost of $10,000 for the first year, subject to annual review.  The proposal is subject to approval by the National Trust of SA and the Hallett, Robertstown and Eudunda Councils.
