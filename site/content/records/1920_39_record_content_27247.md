Sir George Wilkins (Sir Hubert Wilkins) was honoured by a gathering at Mt Bryan East School on Saturday.  About 150 attended.  A panel containing portraits of Sir George, his companion Lieut. Elson and their plane was presented. [From the Alaska-Spitzbergen flight of 1928.]  Five of his brothers and his only surviving sister attended: Harry W. (Victor Harbor), Fred (Glenelg)

Frank (Malvern), Tom (Tusmore), Arthur (Goolwa) and Annie Mrs Cockshell (Forestville).  Sir George was the youngest of 12.  The family left for Victor Harbor about 25 years ago.  Notables present were the Commissioner of Crown Land Hon. G.F. Jenkins, Sir John Melrose, Miss L. Melrose, Mr R. Carter MP, Mr Morley Bath of Rigleys Ltd [sic] [Perhaps Rigby’s Ltd the publishers?]  The Chairman of the School Committee had been a schoolmate of Sir George at Mt Bryan East and in Adelaide.  Other speakers were Hon. G.F. Jenkins, Sir John Melrose (who knew him slightly as a lad, but knew his parents well) and Mr H. Wilkins.  Mr Wilkins said it was just 50 years since his father arrived at Mt Bryan East and 92 since his grandfather arrived in SA.  His father was born in SA in 1836 (and Sir John Melrose’s in 1838).  Fred Wilkins supported his brother’s remarks.  Mr Bath presented the panel.  Mr R. Carter also spoke.  A lavish tea was then served in the supper room at the rear of the church.  (Morley Bath is a nephew of Thomas Bath of Burra.)
