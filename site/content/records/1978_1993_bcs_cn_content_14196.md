BCS.  Staff Profile: Les Hastings

Born in Los Angeles.  When 8 years old migrated to the San Joaquin Valley and two years later to Northern California.  After High School joined the US Air Force.  After a term there studied as a teacher at Humbolt State University in Northern California.  Was working in Battle Ground, Washington State when my first son, Les, was born and was in the Columbia Gorge area when second son, Matt, was born a year later.  Taught at Stevenson H.S.  We enjoyed hiking, fishing and travelling the USA, witnessed a total eclipse of the sun and the eruption of Mount St Helens.  My wife Kathy died in 1985 and in March 1986 we received news of this exchange with Australia.
