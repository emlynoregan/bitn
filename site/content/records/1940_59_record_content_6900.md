Cpl A.B. Ridings writes from Somewhere in Palestine 30 June.  The convoy trip was monotonous due to the blackout.  He had a chance to have a good look around Colombo and had since seen Suez, Pt Said, Ismalia, El Cantara, Gaza, Haifa, Jerusalem, Nazareth, Tiberias and just beyond the Syrian border.  He describes the local scenery and expected to soon be moving on.  He was fit well and happy when writing.
