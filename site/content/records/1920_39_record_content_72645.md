Burra Town Council, 3 October

The Unemployment Relief Council forwarded a list of persons eligible to benefit under the subsidy scheme in Burra with the amount of each entitlement.

The insurance company will forward Â£8-10-0 for damage to the Bowling Green fence.

Cr Lott says calculations show the truck is averaging 11 miles per gallon.
