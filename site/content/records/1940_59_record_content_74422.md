Accident.  A horse owned by Mr Cyril Irlam and valued at £15 was injured on Saturday night when hit by a car driven by Mr E.J. Lehmann of Burra.  The accident occurred at 10.45 p.m. in Ludgvan St near the Redruth Methodist Church.  The horse was severely injured about the head and was lying in the roadway.  It was later struck again by a car driven by Mr Brian Sheridan of Burra North, no doubt due to the numerous vehicles obscuring the animal.  It was later destroyed by Constable Clift of the Burra North Police.  It was removed on Sunday morning.  Damage to Mr Lehmann’s car was c. £10 and to Mr Sheridan’s c. £25.
