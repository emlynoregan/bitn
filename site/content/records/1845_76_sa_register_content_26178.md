Robert Palmer writes from Saddleworth 20 November on Farming in the Northern Areas derived from a trip northwards from Clare.

The first 20 miles take you through the magnificent estate of Mr G.C. Hawker.  The roads have carefully been laid out to avoid cutting up that property.  The next 10-12 miles is open grassy plain; ideal for agriculture, but so far a mere sheep run, being still reserved for the squatter.  Beyond lies the Broughton country where cultivation is extending on the finely grassed plains and hills.  10 bushels per acre will be realised.  Redhill is reached in 35 miles.  The Crystal Brook country has splendid grass and timber and will give good returns when cultivated.  Reaping has commenced and the samples are very fair.  Beyond are some miles of grassy plains, fit for agriculture, but I suspect the Government is reluctant to expel the squatters.  A few miles of scrubby country brings the traveller to Port Pirie with its nine jetties, two public houses, two banks, half a dozen stores, a large mill and its choking dust.  On leaving the port the next morning we passed through a grassy plain of 12-15 miles with fine soil fit for anything, but presently unused except by a few sheep.  Hughes Gap brought us to rolling hills and fertile flats, much like the lands of Greenock and Tanunda, with timber for fencing etc. and yet it has not been opened up.  Onwards we went to the open rolling plains towards Laura and Gladstone and Georgetown where crops topped the fence and yields of 25-30 bushels per acre seemed likely.  From Laura, with its air of prosperity, we went down to Gladstone where we noticed the splendid property of H.B. Hughes.  Gladstone is a thriving village with a mill, public house, etc.  The next day we passed through land worth 15-20 bushels per acre, crossed the upper Broughton and re-entered the property of Mr Hawker, which extends in this direction 15 or 16 miles.
