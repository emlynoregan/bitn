The Sunshine Workers held a very successful juvenile bazaar and Xmas Tree last December to aid the Burra Hospital.  Last week the children went up to the Hospital to present articles purchased with the proceeds along with a bright little entertainment.  Among the items were a sedan chair and an Alfred Bed Carriage.  Dr Sangster and Dr Sangster jun. thanked all for the gifts.  (The bed carriage cost £6 and the chair £7-17-0)
