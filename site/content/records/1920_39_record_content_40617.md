Annual Gallagher Sports at Redruth

On 2 January the annual sports for children initiated by the late Jim Gallagher and continued by his son George were held at the Aberdeen Playground.  Alick Ratcliffe and Jack Carpenter assisted in the organisation.  The day was delightfully cool after the heatwave.  The 275 prepared bags of two buns, two peaches and 3oz of lollies proved insufficient.  The tiny tots got five dozen Christmas stockings.  The sports results are printed.  [Personal interest: Walking Match girls 13-14 J. Fairchild 3rd, Girls’ Race 12-14 J. Fairchild 2nd, Boys’ race 12-14 M. Allen 2nd & Boys’ race 12-15 Ted Fuss 2nd.]
