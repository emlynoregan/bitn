Midland Road Board, 19 September

The Burra Mayor and Town Clerk waited on the Board re the town’s wants.

The main road between Kooringa and Aberdeen was very narrow and should be widened.

The Mine Bridge should be repaired.

The road in Aberdeen from the National Bank Corner towards Kooringa should be raised to allow kerbing to be set in place.

Culverts on the road from Redruth P.O. to Killicoat’s Bridge should be lengthened.  [Is this the bridge east of Snake Gully/Victoria Place near the eastern boundary of the Corporation?]

The proposed work from the Kooringa P.O. to the National Bank corner should be done as soon as possible.

The Corporation Inspector should be appointed Ranger over the Main Roads within the town.

The first would be done when funds permitted

The second was deemed good enough until next year when it would be attended to.

The third would be done to allow adequate drainage and would be done at once if it could be managed for the £70-£80 they had available.

The fourth was being done.

The fifth would be done when funds were available.  The road would be raised c. 13” opposite Dr Brummitt’s and about 17-18” opposite Mr Bath’s.

The sixth was agreed to.
