The Merino Capital Committee met at its AGM on 6 July.  President Don Griffen thanked Andrew Butler and Dave Parnell for their efforts in preparing the Pascoe Collection in the Tourist Office.  Mr Griffen was amazed that the committee had not had more response from the community in its request for artefacts for our displays and disappointed that the Eastern Trips that were organised did not eventuate.  It was decided to have an Eastern Promotion Trip on 22 August to promote the Eastern Pastoral Country to visitors.

Jill Wilson writes after spending two weeks as a resident of the Burra Caravan Park, to congratulate the caretakers on the excellent condition of the park and its facilities.  It was quiet despite its closeness to the town centre and the area of the Burra Creek made it easy to relax.
