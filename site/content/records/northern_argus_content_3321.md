At the opening of the Local History Room a cheque for $500 was presented to the Library Board from Ian & Eve Auhl and they have also gifted all royalties from Ianâ€™s books in the future to this same end.  A local history research award will be offered known as the Ian & Eve Auhl Research Award to further the research into the history of Burra and District and the furtherance of the local history collection.
