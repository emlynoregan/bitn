Anzac Commemorative Service last Sunday.

This was a huge success in fine weather.  Brigadier General S. Price Weir who was in charge of the 10th Battalion at the Gallipoli Landing attended.  At 2.45 p.m. a splendid company of returned men under Major R.C. Sexton assembled at the club rooms.  With them was British Army Nurse Mrs W. Pickering who came to live in Burra some months ago.  Mrs D. Keynes (Sister Armstrong) was absent for the first time in many years.  Next came the Light Horsemen led by Lieut. Kenny, followed by the Scouts and then sons of departed soldiers.  WO J.H. Murison led the Burra District Band at the head of the procession.  The soldiers formed a large square on the south side of the Memorial.  Rev. Donald Redding led the service assisted by Capt. Roberts of the Salvation Army.  H.J.B. Jennison laid a wreath on behalf of the RSL.  Rev. Redding gave the address (which is reported in full).  The annual church parade this year was held at the Kooringa Methodist Church and the numbers exceeded its capacity of nearly 500.  Rev. G.C. Hutchinson (late AIF) officiated and the address was given by Brig-Gen. S. Price Weir.  The Burra District Band gave valuable service.
