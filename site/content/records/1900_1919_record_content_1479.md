Ratepayers’ Meeting last Friday considered the slaughterhouse question.  The Local Board of Health proposed taking over the lease from Messrs D. & J. O’Leary of the old slaughterhouse and spending enough to make it a compliant public slaughterhouse.  The present lease had four years to run.  The Board has the right to purchase then or renew the lease for 5, 7 or 14 years at an annual rental of £27.  The sum needed to be spent is £75.  The annual expenditure would be £111 which it was proposed to recover from charging the four local butchers a licence fee of £20 p.a. for large cattle and £10 p.a. for small, plus 3/- a head for large and 3d a head for small cattle.  [The article becomes hard to follow, but it appears that they expected that the revenue from cattle would be £121-5-9 and that the four butchers together would pay a £20 licence fee plus a £10 licence fee for a total income of £151-5-9 p.a.]
