Obituary.  Mrs Theeuff died 25 November aged 90.  She arrived in SA on the Buffalo in 1838 with her parents Mr & Mrs Press.  She recalled Adelaide when there were gum trees everywhere and Government House was a wooden structure and Aborigines were numerous and not always friendly.  Her parents settled first at Hindmarsh.  In 1852 she married William Theeuff and settled at Mt Lofty in a dugout.  They later lived at Sheoak Log, Gawler and North-West Bend where most of the children were born.  In 1856 her husband died. [Obviously incorrect.]  She then came to Burra and took up nursing.  She has lived many years in retirement.  Of 15 children 11 reached maturity and 8 survive: Mr James Theeuff (Broken Hill), Mr Charles Theeuff (Southwark), Mrs T. Ford (Kooringa), Mrs George Hill, Mrs Elisha Ford, Mrs T. Drury (Southwark) [actually Drewery], Mrs. J. Shepherd (Broken Hill) & Miss L. Theeuff (Kooringa).  There are many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
