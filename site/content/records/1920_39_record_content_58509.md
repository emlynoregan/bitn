Armistice Day.  The 17th anniversary of the Armistice was commemorated with one of the best attendances for many years at the memorial in Market Square at 11 a.m.  The service from the Cross of Sacrifice in Adelaide was played, followed by the two-minute silence.  Last Post and Reveille were sounded by Trumpeter A.W. Andrews.  Among those present were the President of the Burra RSL, W.F. Pickering and the Secretary, G.H. Dow.  There was a good attendance of returned servicemen.
