The Phosphate Fields

16 or 17 years ago speculators were attracted to the area because of the alleged discovery of silver in the Black Hills.  Residents may remember the ‘Joker’ claim and even on the ‘Fairview’ claim area a shaft was put down for silver and went through 70% rock phosphate.  Several private syndicates tested the hills for silver and a lot of money was lost in the attempt.  Several years passed and F.A.S. Field was attracted to the spot by the discovery of phosphate rock and he prospected the area at intervals for three years and about three years ago a fairly large deposit was discovered and 120 tons of high grade stone was sent away.  So satisfactory was the assay that the Adelaide Artificial Manure Co. was formed and further work undertaken.

Numerous claims were then pegged out, but many were forfeited on failing to meet the conditions of the leases.  Many were waiting to see what the principal players would achieve.  Eventually only those with some capital and determination remained.  Development work is still going on with the ‘Fairview’ claim of Messrs Field & Clutterbuck, pending erection of a manufacturing works.  The lode has been proved to 25ft deep and 100ft wide at an average 60% tricalcic of phosphate at the north open cut.  The south open cut is about 11½ chains away and is opened to 75ft deep and 137ft wide and the stuff varies from 50 to 85%, but the country is treacherous with big variations in quality within a few yards.  There is 200 tons at grass and some have estimated 1 million tons in sight.

Between the two open cuts is a hill rising about 100ft and a large costeen trench proves the lode to be 400ft wide on the rise.

Just north of ‘Fairview’ is a claim called ‘Lillydora’, held by a local syndicate.  A high grade deposit has been opened by costeens, trenches and shafts and a 10-ton sample averaged 63.40%.

North of that are two other claims with little work done; held by J.C. Killicoat and R.W. Tawcett.

North again is a claim held by E.N. Finch & Sons, which they are opening up and where they have exposed a large body of silicious rock phosphate averaging 50-60%.  Phosphate has not been traced further north.

To the south of ‘Fairview’ about four miles a square mile is held by Messrs Field & Kickebusche.  This is now being opened up and tested.  Samples vary from 65 to 94% and 12 samples across 100yds averaged 76%.

The claims are 18 miles southeast of Burra.  The country is desolate mallee with wild hops bushes and the Burra Creek skirts the south end of the ‘Fairview’ claim
