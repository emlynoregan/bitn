Mongolata

Captain & Mrs Thompson held the usual fortnightly service.

Miss E. Reid won the table tennis tournament.

The above mine has resumed operations with Jack Smith as manager.  About 12 men are engaged so far.  [But no ‘above mine’ is named!  It is presumably Byles’ Mongolata GM, given previous news.]
