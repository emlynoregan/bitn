St Mary’s held its annual vestry meeting on 4 April.  A record number of Acts of Communion were reported.  Many beautiful gifts had been received during the year.  The Rector said they needed only £9 to reach the £70 required to install an electric blower for the organ.  (This has since been subscribed.)  [Personal interest: H.E. Fuss was on the Finance Committee, the Patronage Committee and a representative to the Ruri-decanal* Conference.]
