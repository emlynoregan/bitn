Hardwick College (Kooringa) Branch School held its break-up demonstration in the Wesleyan Lecture Hall on Thursday.  All the Protestant ministers were there.  Among other items the pupils performed the cantata Queen of Choice and a callisthenics display.  The departure of the Misses Hotson was regretted as they had been in charge from the opening.
