W.H. Hardy charged W.J. Davey, proprietor of the Burra Record, with libel, damages being assessed at £19-19-0.  The case took 7½ hours and the plaintiff was severely cross examined for 4½ hours by Mr J.H. Symon QC whose summing up took 2 hours 10 minutes.  The rest of the time was taken by the evidence of W.T. Rabbich for the plaintiff and the summing up of Mr H.R. Hill.  In the end the case was declared a non suit without costs.

Business in the town was practically suspended and visitors came from far and near.

[The report runs for 6½ columns in this issue and at similar length in the next two.]

H.R. Hill appeared for the plaintiff and J.H. Symon QC for the defendant.

Mr Hill said his client had originally intended to sue on eight counts, but would now abandon Section F as it was really a private matter and he doubted if the words applied to him.

The charges related to material printed in the Burra Record and alleged that Davey published statements that:

Implied misconduct by Hardy as a Councillor.

Suggested Hardy had a want of qualifications and skill as a newspaper correspondent.

Suggested Hardy had qualities and conduct disparaging to him resulting in public hatred, ridicule and contempt.

The specific material was:

A)	Feb. 3 1892.  When reporting a vote of censure on Cr Hardy in the Council the writer suggests Hardy had tried to obstruct the business of the town and to annoy members of Council and implies Hardy was to blame for ‘things [that] have been so disgraceful of late’.

B)	July 13 1892.  [Hardy had suggested in writing for the Catholic paper that Mr Holder was writing the leading articles for the Record.]  Davey had written that Hardy had offered to do the job for 10/- per week, but ‘we had such contempt for him and all his effusions that we did not entertain his offer in any shape or form . . . Even at this absurd price we considered his service not worth the amount.’

We ‘shield ourselves from him just in the same way as a person would shield himself from a venemous [sic] serpent’.

C)	Article ‘Burning Effigies’.

This refers to an article published in the Burra Record 13 July 1892 and refers to ‘Burning Effigies’.  It says that a halt was made at the Institute and the writer [Hardy] was challenged to address them on his reasons for writing the letter.  He declined.  ‘He was offered to be let into a secret by which he could earn £ a week, but all inducements failed.  The captain then thanked the crowd for their orderly conduct and informed them they had seen the last of the notorious ink slinger of Burra.’

D) 	Letter: Death on Bad Ink Slinger.  [A shearer wrote to the paper referring to an article by Hardy that appeared in the Southern Cross, in which article Hardy apparently accused larrikins, led by a non-Burraite, of recent activities there that included burning Hardy in effigy.]  The writer says he has worked in the area for four years and that the residents turned out of their own free will.  He writes that Hardy first called the Burra people respectable residents and the next a howling mob.  ‘Mr editor is it not an old saying ‘give a fool a rope and he will hang himself.’

E)	Oct. 5 1892.  In an article headed ‘Actuated by Animus’

Among other comments on a turbulent year in the Council Davey wrote: ‘one of the Councillors is continually finding fault and thus delaying the business of the town’.

‘If all the meetings were depicted on paper, one of the members, would, no doubt, be ashamed of himself.’

‘there is a poisonous serpent amongst them who delight [sic] in stirring up hatred and malice; and we hope for the sake of the town and its future progress that this tyrant will, at the Municipal elections of 1893, be relegated to obscurity.’

‘When the business of the Council was about to be commenced Councillor Hardy asked one or two grossly insulting remarks which reflected on this journal.’

‘it is to be hoped that [the ratepayers] will consider the very unwise procedure of placing men in the Council who are unfit for the position.’

‘Councillors say they are “full up of these corrobories [sic] and waste of time caused by one obnoxious individual.”’

The editor then says he has received a number of disgraceful and abusive letters since refusing Hardy a position and ‘a postcard of recent date was not allowed to pass through the post office and which was subsequently forwarded to the Postmaster General.’

‘they could only emanate from a man of illiterate bearing.’

‘Councillor Hardy was so sorely disappointed at his meeting with adverse criticism and his feeble attempt to censure the chairman of the public works that he is trying to find fault with the report of that memorable meeting.’

Following the disturbance over the Waterworks engineer resulting in the Council’s paying £31 p.a. more: ‘We told him then to lay back and allow competent men to proceed.’

G)	Jan. 11 1893.  [This related to Hardy’s attack on the Town Clerk’s actions when a breakage occurred at the Waterworks.]

‘W.H. Hardy in his usual contemptible way . . . asked the Mayor who supplied the editor of the local paper with the news . . . ‘

‘it is foolishness for Councillor Hardy to try to make a mountain out of a mole-hill.’

H)	Jan. 11 1893.  [In Council proceedings the paper reported an attempt by Cr Hardy and Cr Kitchen to get the Waterworks engineer to personally pay for extra labour put on at the time of the breakage.  The passage most offensive to Hardy seems to have been: ‘This was in direct opposition to Cr Hardy’s wish, who for some unaccountable reason has not had a good word to say for the engineer since that time, consequently plots have been devised to oust him, but they have proved fruitless, though he has been the victim of a very unpleasant time.’]

Mr Symon said he would show the statements made were justifiable and true.

Mr Hill would show, he said, that the private feelings of the writer had gotten the better of him and the attacks on Hardy were unwarrantable: hardy was merely trying to do his duty.

Hardy was then sworn in.

He gave evidence of having bought the papers concerned, though Mr Symon was continually interrupting and picking up Mr Hill on technicalities and trivial matters of law.  After considerable legal nitpicking it was avowed by Hardy that he did his best not to obstruct the business of the town.  Attention turned to his offer of services for 10/- per week.  The letter he wrote on this was produced and is reprinted.  It is dated 21 Sept. 1891.  He also said he made the same offer twelve months earlier.  A second letter of 25 Sept. 1891 is also reprinted.  Hardy denied he had offered to be a ‘general lackey’ on the paper.

Mr Symon, ‘What do you call it then?’

Mr Symon asked why Hardy had waited so long to bring action.  Hardy said it was the 5 October item that had been the last straw.
