Township of Aberdeen: on the Bon Accord Property, adjoining the Burra Burra Mine.

Samson & Wicksteed & Co. (successors to Mr John Bentham Neales) have been honoured with instructions from the proprietors to offer the same at public sale on the ground on 15 September at noon.  The whole of the township will be offered in allotments suitable for building and other purposes.  The proprietors reserve all mineral rights, but as the town is laid out on the land least likely to be disturbed by mining, this in all probability will be merely a dead letter.  The auctioneers draw the attention of those disappointed in the sale of Redruth, to this township, which is in point of situation, far superior.  Catalogues and plans will be available prior to the sale.

Terms 20% cash, 20% in 6 months, 20% in 12 months, 20% in 18 months and 20% in 24 months.
