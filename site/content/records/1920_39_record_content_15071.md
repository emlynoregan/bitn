Opening of the Redruth Methodist Memorial Sunday School

This building was opened last Saturday free of debt by James Reed JP.  The site adjacent to the church was bought for the purpose over 30 years ago.  A large crowd assembled for the occasion.  Among those present were: Miss Emily Preece (a daughter of the late Ben. Preece who founded the Wesleyan Sunday School), the James Tiver family with their mother who turned 88 that day, Richard Reed (88), The Bentley & Young families, Mrs T.H. Woollacott Sen. (nee Young), members of the Teddy, J.R. Gary, Clode, Rabbich, Ridgway, Goss, Bartholomaeus, Sara, Thomas, Finch, Fuss, Woollacott, Gare, Sleeman, Pilz and J. & W. Pearce families.  People also attended from Kooringa, Hallett, Mt Bryan, Mt Bryan East, Hanson, Booborowie & Leighton.  The design is Early Norman corresponding with the church and is in bluestone with cement facings.  It has a frontage of 90 ft and a depth of 74 ft.  The service began at 3 p.m. with Rev. Harry Alvey.  Other ministers present were: Rev. F.L. Rooney (Riverton), Rev. W.J. Mortimer (Adelaide), Rev. L.D. Rooney (Saddleworth), and Rev. J.C. Oliver (Booborowie).  The architect J.H. Laity presented the key to Mr James Reed.

Mr Reed said he had first been a Sunday school scholar when the school was held in the German Church.  After Methodist Union the school was moved to the Primitive Methodist Church which was altered and called Jubilee Hall.  This had been used for 20 years.  40 years ago the block had been purchased and 26 years ago some of the trustees had wanted to build.  He thanked the architect for the design and the contractors, Messrs T.H. Woollacott and F.M. Pearce, both of whom were old scholars.

The building had cost a lot and on the previous Tuesday £1,190 was wanted to complete it.  Mr Alvey was optimistic that the whole debt would be wiped off before the services were over.  First they interviewed Mr John Melrose and got a cheque for £100.  Then Mr J.H. Gallagher gave another £100 and Mr I.J. Warnes another £100.  W.H. Sandland & N.H. Pearse gave £21 and Dr McKellar Hall £25.  A.S. Martin gave £5 and Mrs S.M. Lane £2-10-0.  These were donations from outside the church and put with adherents’ donations there was now only £390 due on the building and furniture.

The building was then opened.
