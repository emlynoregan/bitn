Redruth Methodist Circuit

The Methodist Conference has appointed Rev. R.C. Yeoman to the circuit and concern is being expressed over this.  Rev. Yeoman was here about 12 years ago before Methodist Union and he is looked upon as a very capable preacher and a diligent worker, but he is 60 and cannot be expected to do the work of a young man in a circuit that comprises Redruth, Westbury, Ironmine, Booborowie and Hanson.  The circuit has expressed its dissatisfaction while having nothing against Rev. Yeoman.  They have been unfortunate in that the almost continuous illness of Rev. J. Allen in the past year has resulted in double expense.
