Obituary.  On 28 May Mrs Warnes, the wife of a sheep farmer near Burra, left four children alone in her house for a few moments and returned to find a girl aged about 2 in flames.  She quickly extinguished the fire and the childâ€™s injuries did not seem to be extensive, but at 6 a.m. the next morning she suddenly died.  Dr Dashwood ascribed the death to nervous exhaustion consequent upon the fire.

[Amy Warnes born 19 March 1864, Burra Survey: died 29 May 1866 near Kooringa.]
