Burra Mine.  Some years ago the Burra Progress Assoc. compiled a full and comprehensive résumé of the history of the Burra Mine and published it in pamphlet form.  A few months ago a copy was sent to the Leader of the Opposition in State Parliament, but we have now been advised that it never reached him.  The Council is now trying to get the matter re-opened through Mr G.S. Hawker MP, but cannot find another copy of the pamphlet.  Can anyone help out?  Moves to find more copper at Moonta are being made, so why not at Burra?
