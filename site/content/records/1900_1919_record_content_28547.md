Obituary.  Mr John Morgan died 31 December 1910 aged 71.  He was born in Gloucestershire in 1839 and arrived in SA in 1858 in charge of horses for the late Dr Brown.  He was among the first to take up land at Baldina and one of the first to grow wheat on the east side of the ranges.  Some time ago he sold most of his land and took the job of ranger, inspector and overseer of works for the Burra District Council.  He was an active member of the Burra School Board of Advice.  A short while ago he developed bronchitis.  He leaves a family of six sons and six daughters: Walter (Ironmine), John (Yancannia Station NSW), Herbert (Redruth), William (Kooringa), George Brettle & Edwin Henry (Morganville Station [sic]), Mrs W. Byles (Redruth), Mrs D.E. Williams (Ironmine), Mrs Henry Motherall (Hanson), Mrs H.A. Byles (Old Koomooloo), Mrs W.H. McWaters (Sampson’s Well) & Mrs W. Morgan (Boulder City WA) and 42 grandchildren.  [Born 6 October 1839.]
