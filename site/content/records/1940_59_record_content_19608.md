Obituary.  Mr Isaac James Warnes died at Burra Hospital on Saturday [25 November].  The district has lost one of its most outstanding citizens and SA one of its best-known pastoralists.  For very many years he has been a leader in the town and district and has thrown his energy and initiative into anything concerning its welfare.  He gave generously, especially to the Show Society, the District Council and the Burra Hospital.  He had been President of the Burra Burra Show Soc. since 1914 and his total donations to it exceeded £2,000.  He was mainly responsible for obtaining the present showgrounds and in building the fine Centennial Hall on the site.  When the society moved to the present showgrounds Mr Warnes subscribed £100 and made teams available for the work needed.

About 38 years ago he was elected to the old Mt Bryan DC and was Chairman when it amalgamated with the DC of Burra Burra.  He became Chairman of the amalgamated body until forced to relinquish the role due to failing health in 1942, though he remained a member of Council till his death.  He was a member of the Burra Burra Hospital Board for many years and donated liberally towards its welfare and donated the present X-Ray unit.

He had been President of Burra Stockowners’ Assoc. & Burra District Stockowners’ Assoc. since 1891.  His interests extended well beyond the local district.  He was elected one of the first directors of the Stockowners’ Co-operative Shearing Co. when it was formed in 1917.  He was a director of Byles Mongolata GM Syndicate and did all he could to place Mongolata Goldfield on its feet.  He was a member of SA Stockowners’ Assoc. for about 50 years and Chairman from 1921-23 and President of the Graziers’ Federal Council in 1922 and for a number of years a member of the Council of the Royal Agricultural & Horticultural Society.

He took particular interest in assisting the wool industry and tried to convince small producers that to get the best financial returns they had to have their wool classed correctly.  In 1924 he had students from the School of Mines class the Koomooloo clip according to types of wool and this led to general improvements in wool classing throughout the state.  He extended an annual invitation to members of the Burra Burra Show Soc. to attend the shearing at ‘Sturt Vale’ to see classing in operation and many farmers availed themselves of the opportunity offered and learned much from the visits and from Mr Codrington the wool expert who was always in attendance.  On arrival after the 75 mile trip visitors would be greeted by Mr Warnes and lavishly entertained.  He would ensure they all had petrol for the return journey and stay by the phone at the station till he heard they had returned safely.  Members of the Chow Society also received his hospitality at the annual Show Luncheon.  He was a great believer in public halls and had much to do with the erection of halls at Leighton, Booborowie and Mt Bryan.

As a pastoralist he owned Koomooloo, Old Koomooloo, Lagoon, King’s Well & Sturt Vale Stations.  He owned property also at Booborowie and formerly owned Wahroonga Station in that locality.

Some years ago with failing health, he and Mrs Warnes retired to Glenelg, but he retained his interest in the district and was a frequent visitor.  He was a son of the late Mr & Mrs Tom Warnes, pioneers of the Burra District and was born 29 October 1871.  He is survived by his widow Mrs Mary Jane Warnes OBE (nee Fairbrother) and three sons: Rex, Tom & Jim.  Rex & Tom are at Koomooloo and Jim is in the RAAF.  The funeral at the Burra Cemetery on Sunday was very largely attended.

[Born 28 October 1871 near Kooringa: died 24 November 1944 Burra, residence Glenelg.]
