Fire.  A fire started close to Mr W.I. Short’s garden on Monday afternoon and several acres of grass and some fencing were destroyed.  Fortunately Mr Short was present and with difficulty got the fire under control.  The west wind fortunately saved Mr R. Austin’s stubble paddock.  Mr Short lost the best part of his grass feed and several fruit trees were badly damaged.  Mrs Short managed to secure the haystack in the garden.
