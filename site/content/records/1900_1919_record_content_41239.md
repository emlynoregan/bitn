The Belgian Bees and the Burra Hockey Girls staged a very successful concert in the Institute Hall in aid of the Belgian Relief Fund.  [All prior references are to Belgium Bees.  These were a specially formed group of male and female performers for this concert apparently, as the review says they have had but a short life of three weeks or so.  Their inspiration seems to have come from the idea of ‘busy as a bee’ and also from the colours of the Belgian flag (red, black and yellow) which were repeated in their costumes.]

The concert is reviewed in 11/5 columns.  Door takings were £20.
