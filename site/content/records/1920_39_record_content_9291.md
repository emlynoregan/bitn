Burra Show Soc. AGM was held last Friday.

Profit from the last show was expected to be between £75 & £100.

There was discussion over some of the details of the day’s events – particularly over the controversial disqualification of Mr McBride’s pony after it had won, on the ground it exceeded the height limit.  There was also discussion over competitors removing exhibits early.
