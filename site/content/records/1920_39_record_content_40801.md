Mr McHugh supported a bore on the site.

Mr George supported the request and thought the field had gone beyond the experimental stage and now deserved support.

Mr McInnes referred to the dire financial times.  If a scheme did not return 5% it had to be supported by taxes in some other form.  He would give the Burra problem serious thought.  There were other country and metropolitan areas in equally bad circumstances.  He thought the telephone request might be granted without further consideration.  He believed an on-site bore at Mongolata was a reasonable request and as it would aid in providing employment would be given very favourable consideration.  He did not think it likely the Minister responsible could increase rations to men who were working, but he would see what he could do.
