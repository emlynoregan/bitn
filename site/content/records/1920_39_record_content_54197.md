Mongolata Goldfield

During the holidays Byles’ Mongolata GM directors visited the mine with a noted English mining man Dr Moore.  Apparently he confirmed the report of Mr Price who recently reported most hopefully on the mine’s prospects.  Mr A.D. McDonald MP was present and it was decided to ask all local MPs to push Mongolata’s interests and to get some Federal grant to get the field tested with diamond drills.
