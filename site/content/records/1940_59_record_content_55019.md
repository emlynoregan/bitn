Burra History.  An article under the heading ‘World News’ is clearly reprinted from some un-named publication.  It says that a girl picking wildflowers in 1845 noticed blue-specked earth and reported it.  Mines quickly developed.  Miners came from Cornwall and dug their homes out of the clay along the banks of the Burra creek until they were driven out by floods and houses built from stone quarried from the hills.  Johnnie Green is mentioned: ‘dangles from a pole at the northern entrance to the town.’  Low price of copper and flooding of the pits caused abandonment of the mines after over £5 million worth of copper had been taken.

[A girl picking wildflowers is much more romantic than an alcoholic shepherd!]
