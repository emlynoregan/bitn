The club is in credit £119-6-1 plus War Savings stamps of £370-6-0.  In the year the main money-raising activity was the Pet Show at the Burra North Playground on 28 September which with a subsidy of £137 made a total of £207 for two new tennis courts.  A new football and basketball were purchased and a Christmas parcel sent to each of the three Burra boys in the Magill Reformatory, comprising cakes, biscuits, sweets and games.  A Christmas break-up party was held for the children 19 December.  Elected: President, Mrs Jennison; Vice-Presidents, Mesdames Woodards & Kirby; Secretary, Mrs Trueman, Assistant Secretary, Mrs M. Heinrich and Treasurer, Mrs C. Pearce.
