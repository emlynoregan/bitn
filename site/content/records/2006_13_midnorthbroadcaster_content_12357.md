Stock Thefts are being tackled in a SA Police program called Operation You.  Evidence is being collected from Yorke Peninsula and the Mid North and owners are being asked to report losses, following awareness that thefts have been under-reported.  The program has been going for two months and will continue for at least twelve months.  Stock owners are considering micro-chipping stock â€“ at least for stud stock.
