Letter from Rev. R.J. Daddow warning electors that the National Defence League is attempting to have some persons’ names removed from the electoral roll.  Two or three individuals are doing so in the east and west of Adelaide.  They claim to be purging the rolls of dead and absent voters.  They are trying to get removed the names of labouring men who have to go away to get work even if the family remains.  Why not try the same for wealthy squatters who are often away for weeks at a time?  Because, of course, he is a member of the National Defence League.  Watch Out.
