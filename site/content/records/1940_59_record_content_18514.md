Burra Town Council.

Cr Harvey said that apparently the SAR had decided to get reticulated water from the Morgan-Whyalla pipeline to the railway station for their locomotives.  He was under the impression that they were to build new tanks there for it.  He thought it would be an opportunity to pump the water to the empty tanks on a nearby hill and from there gravity feed it to the town.  The Mayor thought the cost of such water would be at the rate of £5 minimum charge and then so much per thousand gallons.  He wondered how some old people with water rates of 15 shillings of £1 would view such a scheme.  It was resolved to get Mr McDonald MP to obtain particulars of the possibility of reticulating Murray River water to Burra.
