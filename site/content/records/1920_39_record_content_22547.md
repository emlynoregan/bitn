The Late Trix Pearce: a reprint of a tribute from the city papers of 9 March.

She was Secretary of the Burra Branch of the Cheer-up Society in the War and was unremitting in her efforts.  She was personally complimented by the Prince of Wales at a meeting of women war workers in the Exhibition Building in Adelaide.  Sir Henry and Lady Galway had a portrait taken with her.  The Burra society not only greatly assisted the Adelaide Society in supplying money for the building of Burra Hall, which was the integral section of the Adelaide Cheer-up Hut and in sending huge supplies of foodstuffs, but it also helped materially the Red Cross, the League of Loyal Women, the YMCA, Army Nurses Association, the Trench Comforts Fund, Overseas Tobacco auxiliary Fund and the Salvation army Trench Comforts Fund and in making and sending thousands of woollen comforts to the front.  While officers and committee etc. were all splendid workers, Miss Pearceâ€™s untiring energy and sparkling example were largely responsible for the results.  She organised a body of 70 of the Cheer-up Girls who on occasions rode in Adelaide on fine horses and paraded the city streets soliciting funds.  When the local band was without players because so many had enlisted she organised a ladies band that became noted for its excellent music.  The devotion and thoroughness displayed in her patriotic work carried over into all aspects of her life.  She was long associated with Mr G.E. Dane, leader of the Institute Orchestra, as pianist and cellist.  She also played the organ.  She was fond of sport, particularly tennis and was a good shot.  Her sudden death was due to an undiagnosed heart problem which led to a blood clot to the brain.
