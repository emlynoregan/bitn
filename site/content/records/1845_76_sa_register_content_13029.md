Kooringa News, 25 January

Weather.  The heat on Friday, Saturday and Sunday was intolerable with the thermometer reaching 114°F in the shade.

On Wednesday the telegraph station was opened here in rooms of the Mechanics’ Institute, lent by the Committee.  Messages were sent to the furthest station at Mt Gambier and to every other station along the line and answered in a very short time.
