Changes in Working the Burra Mine

Mr Darlington, a mining engineer of considerable standing, arrived here by the July mail to advise the Burra Directors on the future working of the Mine.  He has since spent most of his time at the Mine.  Last Thursday Hon. H. Ayers and G.S. Kingston with Messrs Jaffrey and Beck visited the Mine and we understand Mr Darlington has recommended a system of trenching rather than mining.

Extensive excavations will be made to the creek side of the Mine.  Nearly the whole of the orey country comprising the present workings, all the drives, slides, levels and shafts will go and all the ore left as supports along with large deposits of rich stuff used in filling up.  Even all the timber will be recovered and if suitable for no other purpose will become fuel for the engines.  This will no doubt shock many traditional miners, but will be far less evil that the total or partial suspension of work at a mine that was once the saviour of the colony.  We hope these plans will accomplish what their proponents anticipate.  The scheme is not yet fully developed and decided on, but if adopted, the workings being developed presently in the usual manner will be stopped.  Regular tutwork and tribute men would not be required and ordinary labourers could do the work, leaving miners for other advanced mines in the colony.

It is not clear how they would manage the dressing operations with ordinary labour, but it is certain that much done by hand will be done by machinery.  The invention comes from Germany and if successful is sure to be applied to other mines in the colony.

Mr Darlingtonâ€™s report will be laid before the Directors at the meeting next month.  It is believed Mr Darlington will proceed to England by the next mail to procure the requisite machinery and the new system could be under way within twelve months.
