The Mine.  Since the meeting of 17 February the town is hopeful of some development of the mine.  So far the ‘imaginings’ of various people have been fruitful and now the imagining the Government would lend a pump has been fruitful.  We are now ‘imagining future developments in the mine’ [The article continues on page 3.]

There are those who will say what’s the use – the game is not worth the candle.  It is expected the pumping plant will be sent as soon as possible.  The Government has agreed to deliver it to Burra Railway Station free of charge.
