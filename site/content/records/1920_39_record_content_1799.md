Violet Day was celebrated on 1 August in the Institute and the hall was packed despite the bad weather.

Violet Day was inaugurated five years ago in Burra by the Cheer-up Society to commemorate the fallen and to raise money for patriotic purposes.  This year saw a united service with many returned men present.  The offertory of £8-12-8 is to go to the Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial Fund.
