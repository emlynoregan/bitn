Burra Town Council

The State Trophy Committee advised that the field-gun was now at the station.

Application has been made to proclaim the town under the Fire Brigade Act 1913, from 31 January 1922.

The Municipal Association advises that the Council is responsible for the safety of vehicles using Drew Lane.  The mayor said orders have been given at Drew & Crewes to have the post moved back in line with the building.

Cr Radford said removing the post will create a danger from the drop of 15” into the drain, which would need protection.  Slabs will be placed over the drain.

Council will inspect drainage from places in Market Square that runs into the watertables and then lies there due to the slight fall.

The Railway Commissioner advises that the gate and turnstile at the entrance to the station are to be removed.

The Assessment for 1922 was £10,454, up £607 on 1921.

I.J. Warnes has offered a 15” pipe for the Young St Ford.  Offer accepted.

Burra has not been considered for a vacancy on the State Children’s Council as promised and a letter will be sent to the Chief Secretary on the matter.

The Mayor said they had to decide where to store the field-gun until its permanent placement was decided.  It was resolved to put it in the Depot Yard.
