Burra Rifle Defence Club.  Annual meeting on Wednesday at the Commercial Hotel.  W. B. Page, President, took the chair.  There was a credit balance of £5-9-4.  Elections for the next year resulted in: President, A.B. Hiddle; Secretary, J.A. Pearce; Treasurer, C.A. Pearce.  Annual subscriptions were set at 6/- payable half-yearly.

Best average for the year 1900-01 was R.D. Pascoe with 76 over 19 matches followed by C. Parks with 74 over 19 and J.A. Pearce with 73 over 23.

There were 55 members and 37 members completed class firing for the year.  This resulted in there being 5 marksmen, 2 first class shots, 3 second class shots and 27 third class shots.  This is not altogether satisfactory.

There were 9 matches with outside clubs of which Burra won 6 and lost 3.

Local club matches for donated prizes were welcomed and their donors thanked.

The SADR Clubs Association was formed some time ago, but has had little benefit and membership of it seems of doubtful value.  The Government’s £400 for class firing among the military forces excludes Defence Rifle Clubs which the President described as grossly unfair.  The clubs were also excluded from the celebrations of the opening of the Federal Parliament.  We hope for better things from the new Commonwealth.

At the rifle match on Monday at Burra the home team 687 defeated Port Pirie 589.
