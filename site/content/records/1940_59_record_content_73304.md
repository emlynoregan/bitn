Dogs have been mauling sheep at Leighton.  Mr Roy Humphrys had to slaughter two of six top stud ewes attacked in one paddock and valued at 40 guineas each.  A mob of 150 ewes and lambs were attacked on Mr S. Pearceâ€™s property, tearing wool and skin from the ewes and biting young lambs on the legs.
