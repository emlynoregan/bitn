Mongolata Goldfield

Hon. S. Whitford Chief-Secretary visited last Friday.

A group of alluvial miners last week found a spring of good water about 10ft down.

Mr McRostie found a death adder under loose earth on the floor of the shaft at Block 8 last week.  As he and Mr Roberts had been groping around with their hands they both had a lucky escape from death.

The drawn out erection of the battery continues and the Minister now says it is about a month to the opening.

Byles’ GM Co. At 92ft the main drive south has advanced to 89ft in lode.

At 52ft the drive is at 78ft.  Some rich ore has been got on the east side, but values generally are poor.

At 25ft one man is taking off leading stope.  Values are poor.

Golden Harp.  The present face is 9ft high in quartz and iron seams in bunches and veins with irregular patches of mullock.  Work is not yet below surface capping.
