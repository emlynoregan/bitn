Mt Bryan Methodist Sunday School held its anniversary on 4 April with very fair congregations.  Mr P. Tilbrook of Mt Bryan East gave the address in the afternoon and Rev. R. Brook preached in the evening.

PO C.J. Morrison is reported in the Advertiser as one of those involved in the air battle over Milne Bay last week.  Prior to the war he was in charge of World’s End School and later married Miss Essie McWaters.  In the list of New Year awards he received the Air Force Cross.

W.J. Thomas, retired grazier of Burra North has realised £70 for local patriotic bodies from making concrete flower pots.
