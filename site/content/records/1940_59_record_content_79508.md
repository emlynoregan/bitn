Mt Bryan East.  Weather: lightning struck the telephone line near the home of Mr & Mrs E. Wilks and Mrs E.M. Thomas.  Tops were broken off two wooden poles and the poles splintered to ground level.  Flames ran easily along wires for 200 yards and the wires were fused and broken where they entered the house.
