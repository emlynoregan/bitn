Burra High School Speech Night was replaced by an outdoor assembly on Thursday afternoon.  Speeches were delivered by Mr Riggs and Mrs Jennison and Mr Riggs presented prizes and Intermediate certificates.  Mrs Jennison presented Sports Certificates and Cups.  Mr H.O. Pederick, head teacher, thanked the speakers.

Mr Pederick regretted that few parents wanted their children to be educated beyond Intermediate and many not beyond 14.  Though many jobs are available to those leaving early, few of them offer much advancement in the future.  He spoke of his efforts to start technical classes at night.  The year opened with an enrolment of 81 (a record) with many coming by bus from Willalo, Hallett and Mt Bryan and he hoped in time for a better bus.  In 1946 of the eight who sat for Intermediate four got certificates and two students gained Leaving Certificates.  Sports were not neglected this year.  The Annual Sports Day was held early this year, in May.  Cup winners were:

Senior Boys’ Cup	Donald Allen

Senior Girls’ Cup	Meryl Nelson

Junior Boys’ Cup	John Heinrich

Junior Girls’ Cup	Joan Nelson

He thanked the High School Council and the Parents & Friends’ Assoc. for their help and support and the Town Council for use of the Oval and the Town Library for Library Memberships.

This year the school loses the services of Mr Morley who goes to the Navy as an Instructor and Mr Thorne goes to Peterborough as a permanent employee and Mr Nerlich transfers to Teachers’ College.

Dux of the School	Arthur S. Anderson

Dux of Intermediate	Carliene Davies

Dux of 2nd Year	Rex Anderson

Dux of 1st Year	Eric Clode

[A list of other prize winners is printed.]

1946 Intermediate Certificates went to Arthur Anderson, John Bourman, Rex Haese & George Williams.

1946 Leaving Certificates went to Fayth Hawson-Clarke and Ross Webster.
