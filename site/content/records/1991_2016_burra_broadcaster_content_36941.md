BCS.  Eleven of Burra’s teachers joined the state-wide strike on Tuesday.  They were arguing for better wages for teachers – saying that SA should pay education workers at least at the midpoint nationally.  They were also objecting to the rounding up formula in funding teaching positions, which meant that Burra would lose 0.4 of a position or $40,000.  The government’s proposed wage increase of 14% over three years would place SA second to bottom nationally.  They are seeking 16.5%.
