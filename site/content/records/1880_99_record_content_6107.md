Redruth Court

Griffiths v. Uren for assault

The pair are neighbours at Cemetery Flat.  The defendant assaulted the complainant by catching her by the hair and holding it on the ground to prevent her interfering with her husband who was fighting with the defendant’s paramour.  Complainant also complained of continued verbal abuse as she passed the house.

Uren was jailed for 7 days in default of a fine of £1 + 10/- costs
