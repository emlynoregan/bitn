Kooringa

On Sunday evening a pair of thieves stole every item of clothing worth having from the dugout occupied by a man called Anderson and three others.  The thieves did, however, miss Â£20 in one pound notes in the pocket of an old dirty pair of trousers.  The same thieves stole every stitch of clothing from a bullock driver and then tried to enter the store of Edwin Miller, but here they disturbed Mr Miller and Mr Dyer, who were sleeping in a back apartment when they broke a window.  The thieves fled.  This town of some 3,500 people is inadequately protected by four policemen, especially given that the police station is a mile from the township.  A day or two ago there was bot a grain of gunpowder to be bought in the town.  It is said the thieves are from a broken up gang of Melbourne thieves.
