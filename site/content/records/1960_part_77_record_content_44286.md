Burra Institute Library.  Mr W. Carpenter reported a difficult year.  Financial constraints have been a worry and purchasing has had to be somewhat curtailed.  Acquisition of about 100 books was balanced by discarding about 100.  At present the library holds about 6,100 adult books and 950 juvenile books.  The usual trading table netted $112.75.  Rural Youth donated $20, the Town Council $20 and the District Council $10.  Subscribers are 60; down from 70 last year.  Fifteen years ago there were 340.  Secretary Ben Kotz and Treasurer J.R. Carpenter have done an excellent job.  Mrs Baker has continued to catalogue and cover books.  Unfortunately the librarian Mrs Broad is leaving to take up duties elsewhere.  She has been an efficient librarian for some sixteen months.
