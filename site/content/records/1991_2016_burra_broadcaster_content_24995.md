Squash.  The high cost of public liability insurance has caused the owner of the squash courts at Burra to suspend squash for the coming winter season.  A premium of $1,500 is needed for a $10 million cover and this would add about $40 to each membership.  Terry Wilson, a squash player, says the squash courts are for sale and the asking price is less than replacement cost, so it would be fantastic if they could be publicly owned like so many other sporting facilities in the town.
