Immediate measures are needed to stop any further immigration ships.  So long as the mania persists we would merely be spending our land fund to benefit the labour market in NSW.

Fortunately SA can boast a race of men bound by no ordinary ties to her soil.  She will reap the reward of the system that has allowed the poor man to become a freeholder.  They will no lightly throw away the advantages they have reaped by the sweat of their brow.  On this security we rest.  There will remain enough sturdy arms and toil-hardened hands in SA among her freeholders to reap her harvests and shear her sheep, though hosts of the labouring population should, to their own bane, leave us.
