Mt Bryan has had an influx of new settlers and only one or two pioneer residents have survived to see it.  Fruit and flower gardens are holding their own and vegetable gardens are extensive.   On older properties the older inadequate houses have been replaced by nice dwellings, but most new settlers are making shift with primitive homesteads.  Today there are about 60 farms in the district.  They are practical farmers getting the most from their land.  Mt Bryan’s jollifications in clued ‘at homes’, surprise parties etc.  Tennis is much practised and football will become more prominent.  Several town allotments have been sold.  Closer settlement is just the thing for the Mt Bryan District.
