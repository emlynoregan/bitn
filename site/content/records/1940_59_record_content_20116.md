Burra Burra DC.  At the last Council meeting on Monday, the Chairman, Cr H.C. Atkins gave notice of his intention to resign from Council.  This decision follows his retirement from farming and his intention to move to Kingswood, with his wife and daughter.  Mr Atkins has been active in Council affairs for some twenty years.  He was Chairman of the old DC of Hanson for many years until it amalgamated with the DC of Burra Burra.  Between the Hanson Council and the Burra Burra Council, he has been a chairman for about ten years.  Cr Atkins has also been Chairman of the Local War Agricultural Advisory Committee, the Fuel Advisory Committee and the Emergency Road Transport Committee.  He has also been a member of the Board of Management of the Burra Burra Hospital Inc.

At Farrell Flat, he has been President of the Farrell Flat LCL, the War Loan Committee and of several sporting bodies, including the Porterâ€™s Lagoon Boat Club.  He will retain some interest in the local area because his son will manage his Farrell Flat property for him.
