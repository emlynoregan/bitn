Mules Operation on Sheep & Blow Fly Strike.  This article is on an alternative method of control to the Mules Operation, called the Manchester Method.  It involved the application of a caustic preparation.

‘The ewes suffer very little discomfort other than for about 10 minutes after the treatment . . . though they get a little stiff in the crutch while the scab is forming.’
