Mr F. Wheatley was farewelled for the front on Wednesday evening at very short notice.  A farewell dinner was given in the Institute where the Mayor presided over about 50 guests.  Mr Crewes made a speech about Fred Wheatley who he had known all his life.  He produced a very patriotic outpouring.  Captain Lord wished him well from the Rifle Club.  A.D. McLaren spoke on behalf of the Burra Band.  Mr Wheatley had worked very hard to establish the band, being its unpaid conductor for some considerable time during which, in three years, 40 persons passes through it and only 12 or 13 remained constant.  He presented Mr Wheatley with a pipe and tobacco pouch.

Bro. E.J. Harris the Worshipful Master of the Kooringa Lodge, farewelled him on behalf of the Masons and presented him with a safety razor.  He was supported by Bro. Dane, Past Master.  Rev. J.H. Nield spoke and so did S.M. Lane with whom Mr Wheatley had been in business for 20 years.  Mr Crewes presented him with a jack-knife.

Mr Wheatley responded.
