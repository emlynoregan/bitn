Qantas Commercial

On 11 December about sixty people including children worked from 5 a.m. on filming take after take in morning light at the Midnight Oil House.  They then moved to the Burra Railway Station for more filming, before taking a break of several hours.  At 5 p.m. they were back at the Midnight Oil House with its oat crop for sunset filming.  Quite a few locals watched the session.

The Midnight Oil House has featured on many postcards, calendars, posters etc., but this is the first time it has been used for a television commercial to be screened around the world.  The crew flew in from New York only thirty-six hours earlier.  Their camera was valued at $300,000 and was mounted on a crane, which was in turn mounted on a truck.  They came with a wind machine, a catering van, a truckload of gear and other equipment.  Burra CFS attended the shoot.

The Midnight Oil House got to be called that because it featured on the first album produced by the band Midnight Oil, called Diesel and Dust.
