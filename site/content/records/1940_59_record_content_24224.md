Burra RSL has announced its plans for new club rooms.  Their appeal for funds has now reached £2,573-18-6.

The Club has an option for the purchase of the SA Farmers’ Union Building for the sum of £2,000 and on the fixtures, counters, partitions and shelvings, etc. for a further £150.  The building and plant cost three time as much and the RSL is believed very fortunate to be able to obtain such a fine building at a bargain price.  It can be turned into fine and up to date club rooms for a very reasonable cost.  The purchase is subject to the existing tenancy – the Clothing Factory – but with the expiration of military contracts, we believe it is probably the whole building will be available before very long.  In the meantime the intention is to secure the premises and make at least half the building available for the use of RSL members.

It is expected that the furnishing and alterations required will require a further £500 to be raised over the next few months.
