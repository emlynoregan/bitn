Burra Town Council

There was discussion of the reply from the government on the Waterworks.

Cr Hardy moved it be considered at the next meeting.

Cr Rabbich thought they would have to take over the works as the Government otherwise got too much out of the town.

Cr Sampson thought the delay in consideration gave time to get the ratepayers’ feelings.

Cr Rabbich moved an amendment that a ratepayers’ meeting be held on Saturday night to consider the question.  Not 2nd.  Motion carried.

The Finance Committee reported that the total income for the year was expected to be c. £860.

The expected expenditure exclusive of salaries and office expenses £629

Parkland income £139-5-5 and expenditure £124

Health income £125 and expenditure £186

Salaries £50 for the Town Clerk and £50 for the Inspector & Ranger.

[An advertisement shows that the offices were combined as follows:

Town Clerk, Collector of Rates, Registrar of Dogs & Secretary of the Board of Health.

Inspector under the Board of Health & of Weights and Measures and Ranger.]

The dayman was reappointed at 6/6 a day.

The curator of the cemetery was reappointed at the old salary.

The scavenger also received the same terms as before.

There was discussion on the action of the Town Clerk re the reduced assessments, but after some heated exchanges the matter was allowed to drop pending a new mayoral appointment.
