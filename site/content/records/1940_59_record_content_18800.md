Burra Town Council, 4 September

Letters received concerning the transfer of the Institute to the Council from the State Bank & the Institutes Association.

The Bon Accord Reserve gate is to be locked.

If, after inspection, damage to trees at Bon Accord Reserve has occurred it will be placed in the hands of the police.

Note.  Until this date the Burra VAOC Notice had listed shifts from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. and 11 p.m. to 3 a.m.  From 12 September the 11 p.m. to 3 a.m. shift was dropped, but without any comment on whether this was due to reduced need or lack of volunteers.
