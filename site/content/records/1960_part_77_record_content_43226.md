Fires

Fire destroyed 65 acres of crop on the property of Mr D.C. Gebhardt north of Mt Bryan township.  The fire was confined to Mr Gebhardtâ€™s property, on which 40 acres of wheat and 25 acres of oats were lost.

A truck exhaust is believed to have been the cause of a number of roadside fires on Tuesday morning in the Hanson area.  They were brought under control before serious damage was caused.
