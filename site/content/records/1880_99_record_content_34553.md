Editorial on Municipal Affairs.

In 1889 there was no major issue causing dissension and minor matters were handled well and economically leaving the town finances in a fairly satisfactory state.  Mr Holder was unable to stand again due to pressure of business in the city and Mr T.W. Wilkinson has been elected Mayor.  Mr G. Butterworth replaced Mr H. Pinch who retired and the former Councillors John Sampson & D.J. O’Leary were re-elected in East and West Wards.  In the coming year the Waterworks, now in charge of the Council, is a major item to be dealt with.  It is a well-known fact the Council was treated most unfairly by the Government over the construction of the works.  We believe the ratepayers are paying much beyond a fair thing.  Crystal Brook has a storage capacity of 50,000 gallons and 8 miles 72 chains of mains for £4,511-8-8.  Burra has a 31,000-gallon storage and 8 miles 2 chains of mains for £8,517-11-5.  Other comparisons also confirm the extortionate price fixed by those who did the work.  We are paying 5% on the construction costs plus the running cost while other towns pay prices, which do not return 0.5% on construction alone.  The new Council is determined to improve matters.  We trust that any contentions between members in the Council will remain in the chamber and not be allowed to cause ill feeling and animosity in outside life.
