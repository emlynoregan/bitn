Burra Schools

Notes suggest the schools closed on 17 December, which was earlier than usual and appears to have caused disruption to end of year functions.  The High School concert was postponed to 1st term 1938 and the Copperhouse Christmas Tree was cancelled and other High School functions were cancelled.

Leaving Honours results:

Kath McConnon passed English & Economics

Nancy Pearce passed English.

[These changes were a response to the polio outbreak.  Schools remained closed till March 1938.]
