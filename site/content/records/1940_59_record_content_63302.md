Representatives of the Burra Burra DC and the Peterborough DC met at Hallett to discuss this issue.  Representatives will meet with the Minister to get the road bituminised.  The road beyond Burra has a low priority for bituminising and most Government money is at present being spent on the road to Bordertown because of the heavy traffic it carries. Other roads with high priority are those linking the city with River Murray towns via the west and north sides of the river (to avoid building a costly bridge at Blanchetown) and the road through Snowtown leading eventually to Woomera.   The cost of bituminising varies between £6,000 and £18,000 per mile.  The Peterborough link would thus cost about £1,056,000.
