The Burra Race Meeting on Wednesday was quite a successful day’s racing, but gate takings were down at £130.  The track was in fair order.  The CWA ladies provided a wonderful spread for lunch and afternoon tea and made about £90 on the day.  The main race, The Graziers’ Handicap, was won by Siluna, owned by J.R. Browne and ridden by W. Pyers, from only four starters.  The jockey was presented with a whip given by Mr J.M. Gebhardt.  This is the fourth whip he has won at Burra.  Pyers also won on Penarta in the Gum Creek Flying and on Green Bat in the Kooringa Handicap.
