Had found betting shops to have a psychological effect on men he had employed.

Mob psychology led men to bet more than they intended.

He would not employ a man with betting tendencies because it had a detrimental effect on his work.

Employees had gotten into financial troubles because of betting.

He had never had to keep employees wages back to pay the grocer before the days of betting shops.
