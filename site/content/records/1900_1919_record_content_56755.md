Burra Town Council

Drew & Crewes asked for permission to alter their premises.  Granted.

J.B. Ridgway was granted permission to erect scaffolding on Kooringa Road at Graham for the erection of the Scout Room.

The fence of Opie’s Hotel was about 3’6” out on the footpath and would be unsightly when the new Scout Room was erected.

The shortage of carbide means streetlamps will not be lit for 8 nights before and 4 nights after full moon.
