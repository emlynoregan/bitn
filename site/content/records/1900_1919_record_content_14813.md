Fairview Phosphate Claims.  A.H. Hassell from Victoria has lost no time in securing claims previously held by E.N. Finch, S. Baker, P.L. Killicoat and C. Fawcett.

These gentlemen have approached the Mines Dept. pointing out the delay in the office not acceding to the request of the claimholders to renew their licences.  Renewals were sought, but before replying the Dept. granted a licence to Mr Hassell.  The gentlemen concerned have done considerable work and have not been deprived through any infringement of the regulations.  We understand the original holders will be reinstated.
