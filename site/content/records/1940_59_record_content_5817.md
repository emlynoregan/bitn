9/23 Light Horse

Following the camp in the Barossa Ranges, many of the members of the Regiment have joined the AIF.  Recruiting replacements for them is ongoing.  Personnel aged 19-33, who are interested, must apply by 25 May, when the Troop Leader will attend the Drill Hall in Burra from 9.30 a.m. and will see US personnel who wish to join the Regiment.  Members who enlist in the AIF must first return all clothing and equipment to the Troop Leader.  It will be kept separate until the member has been accepted by the AIF.
