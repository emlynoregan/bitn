Editorial.  Dr Cockburn contended that Burra had not been disenfranchised by the election of himself and W.B. Rounsevell, but we believe that Mr Ridgway’s comment to the contrary is correct.  ‘Dr Cockburn is in all his leanings decidedly a radical.  Mr Rounsevell is as decidedly a Conservative.’  If they both stick to their principles they might as well pair off on all-important decisions and both be out of the house.  We rejoice in the return of a man like Dr Cockburn because of the policies he supports, but regret the return of Mr Rounsevell who will neutralise the influence of Dr Cockburn.  The return of Dr Stephens or Mr Ridgway would have delivered two votes on every subject.

2nd Leader on the new Parliament.  There will be 20 new members and the Ministry will be one third new.  Mr G.C. Hawker will most likely be Leader of the Opposition, which will be more powerful and less divided.  Ministries should be more stable in the enlarged House.

Scab.  The Commissioner of Crown Lands says NSW authorities have taken steps to prevent infected sheep from entering the districts of Wentworth and Menindee and therefore no inspector will be sent to Thackaringa.

The Kooringa Police Station has a good crop of pumpkins, melons, tomatoes and other vegetables to defy those who say vegetables will not grow in Kooringa.

Hon. J.C. Bray is likely to be knighted according to a cable from London.

Copper price continues to fall.
