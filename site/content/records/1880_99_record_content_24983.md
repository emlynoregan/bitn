A.H. Forder was the returning officer for the poll in Burra.  F.W. Holder was brought to the Institute Hall in a buggy decorated with flowers and greenery and drawn by about 30 rejoicing electors and preceded by a drag containing the Burra Brass Band playing lively airs.  He was cheered through the streets.  At the hall Holder thanked all for their support and was very pleased to say that the election, though fought hard, ‘had passed without an unkind or personal thing done or said, but the utmost goodwill had been shown’. 

Mr Rounsevell echoed this sentiment.  [Though it seems doubtful if Dr Smyth would have.]

Results:	Holder	749

Rounsevell	682

Cockburn	678

Smyth	82

Informal	26

[There was much discussion in the paper about ‘plumpers’.  These were people who voted for only one candidate, although two were to be elected.  The effect was similar to modern day preference deals.  The battle for second place after Holder could have easily gone either way depending on how many plumpers there were.]
