Redruth Court, 22 April

A young woman aged 15 or 16 was charged with stealing a horse and bridle, saddle, tether rope and headstall.  She was Caroline Harrison.  On Monday in Kooringa she had a bridle with blinkers and asked for the eyepieces to be cut off.  The request was refused.  Later that day she was seen at Mt Bryan Hotel still with the bridle.  Mr Robson, a teamster allowed her to ride as far as Middle Camp where he stopped an hour or so before sunset and turned his bullocks out for the night.  The next day Mr John Thomas of Aberdeen, who had left his saddle, bridle, tether rope and headstall on a dray about five miles from Burra, reported to the police that these items had been stolen and in their place he had found a bridle with blinkers with a stirrup iron and leather, which he suspected were off his saddle.  A little later Messrs Hallett reported the theft of a brown mare from their Wandillah paddock about half way between Robson’s and Thomas’s dray.  Police Trooper Smith went searching and found the accused in a hut at Canowie.  Her explanation being unsatisfactory she was committed for trial at the next Criminal Sessions on both charges.
