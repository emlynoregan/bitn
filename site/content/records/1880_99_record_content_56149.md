Burra Town Council, 19 February.

There is a lengthy report of about 2⅓ columns.

Cr Hardy introduced a new by-law re hawkers.

Cr Sampson thought it was the same as Cr Linkson’s of the previous year, and that had been judged ultra vires [Beyond their legal power] by the Crown Solicitor.  Consequently he objected to the adoption of the committee’s report.

Cr Rabbich said it was not ultra vires: in fact it was in operation at Wallaroo.

Cr West agreed with Cr Sampson.

The mayor read the Crown Solicitor’s opinion of last year’s effort, which said that:

The fine was too large

Exemptions in favour of ratepayers were not allowed

Cr Rabbich admitted the fine was too large.

The report was finally received and will lie on the table.

Cr Sampson took up the question of the new stock road, which he said the DC had undertaken to fence and hand over free of expense to the Town Council.  [i.e. that part within the Town Council area.]  The road had now been opened, but this part of the agreement had not been honoured.

The Mayor read the minute, which did not refer to fencing the road.

Cr Sampson said that nevertheless there had been an agreement to do so.

Cr West substantiated Cr Sampson’s views about the fence.

The Town Clerk said he had spoken to the Chairman of the DC who had said it was not understood the fencing was to be done.
