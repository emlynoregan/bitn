In the past half year the Association has raised nearly 13,000 tons of ore, which have been estimated to average 21 cwt.  The quantity would have been greater, but the occasional influx of water prevented the continuous working of the pitches.   The balance of profits for the half year, after paying two dividends of 200% is £47,673-3-7.  How far our economy is dependent on the success of the mine can be judged from the statement that £170,780-17-0 has been disbursed during the year ending 31 March last, so that with the dividends more than a quarter of a million pounds has, through the instrumentality of this Association, been placed in circulation among a population of 70,000 souls.  After taking everything into account the Association cites a divisible balance of £61,000.  But given the difficulty of converting stock into money during the winter months, the Directors say they cannot yet fix the rate of the dividends for the next half year, but at the usual time for paying dividends they will consider it their duty to declare as large an amount as the Company’s position will safely warrant.

Considerable excitement had been shown before the meeting on account of the effects of the disastrous season.  The drought is such that the cartage of ore has been virtually stopped, with but 70 tons on the road and the Patent Copper Company has but six furnaces out of 19 at work because they are unable to get fuel.  Regardless of this situation the Captain of the Mine has declared ‘that the prospects were never more cheering than they now are’.    And observers have been reassured by the fact that profits are only £3,000 less than on 30 March 1850.

The colony can be reassured by these results and with 7,757 tons of ore and 144 tons of copper on hand within the colony there is no fear of a stoppage in the circulation of money arising from any failure in the operations of the Association.

The manufactured article is being sent largely to India and a consequence is that Indian produce has become cheaper here than in the other colonies, because of our greater facility in making payment.

The number of men and boys employed is 1,042.

There are only 24 employed at Karkulto Mines and the Pompurne Estate (Emu Plains) remains undeveloped.  The colony would benefit from the development of both these estates, which want only men and capital to release their buried treasures.
