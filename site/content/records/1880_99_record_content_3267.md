Burra Town Council

One monthâ€™s leave of absence was granted Cr Dunstan to visit neighbouring colonies.

Tubing has been put down the well in Market Square.

The footbridge near the Courthouse is to be repaired and strengthened.

Council will remove and rebuild the Institute wall upon the Institute Committee agreeing to pay half the cost.

[Tenders are called for this work on the same page.]

W. Herchousen [sic] was injured working for the Council and was granted half pay for the fortnight of his absence.
