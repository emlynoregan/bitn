Cr Parks rather reluctantly went along with it.

He had voted against Littlejohn, but he had never heard any member express their dissatisfaction towards Littlejohn.

Cr Linkson: ‘No we did not.’

Cr Hardy: The Mayor did.’

Cr Hardy also denied knowing anything about reports in the other papers.

Cr Linkson said: ‘Of course you do.’

Hardy tried to explain himself.  He had apologised to Cr Rabbich, but the Council decided his explanation was not to the point and refused to hear him.

Cr Hardy wanted to explain why he wrote to the Record.

Council wanted him to explain why he misrepresented the Council and eventually after further bickering the Mayor put the motion.

Crs Rabbich, Parks, Linkson & Watt voted for.
