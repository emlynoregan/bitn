Court.

Two people fined 5/- each for straying cows in Kooringa.

Thomas Philip Halls charged with selling butcher’s meat in Redruth

Halls claimed (a) not to be a butcher and (b) to be selling sheep not mutton.  He was selling it by the quarter and not weighing it.  He said he was selling it by the whole half or quarter for exactly what he paid for it, making no money on the sale of meat and getting his income from the skins.

He was fined 5/- and he appealed to a higher court.

He was also charged with dressing sheep in unlicensed premises, pleaded not guilty and was fined 10/-

Obituary and Inquest into the fatal accident at Baldina Creek: held at Redruth Courthouse 17 August before W.R. Ridgway JP and a jury of six with W.H. Linkson as foreman.

Daniel O’Brien was found lying under a capsized cart at Baldina creek on the previous day.  He was identified by his son Patrick O’Brien of Emu Downs.

William Prosser found the capsized spring cart and the body about 10 o’clock on the 16 August.  The horse was lying on its side, alive, and O’Brien was under the cart with his legs protruding.

Michael Francis Moylan & John Sampson had seen the deceased at Kooringa hotel and he had left at c. 5 p.m.

The P-C Robert Mack concluded that that the horse had been trotting round in circles on the bank and then gone down the cutting, the driver being asleep or short-sighted.  The damage to the deceased’s head had been done either in the accident or from a horse’s kick.

The verdict was accidental death by capsizing of a spring cart.

[Died 15 August aged 57.]

Baldina Plains School has not reopened and parents are to take action.

Advt.  At Jenkin’s Shoe Store in Commercial St on 25 & 26 August
