Hanson Institute [i.e. Farrell’s Flat] 1⅔column report on a meeting re allowing card playing.  The eventual decision was 12 for and 7 against.  The proponents thought that card games like euchre and whist were harmless fun, but opponents of course thought they inevitably led on to gambling, a dissolute life style, ruin and damnation.
