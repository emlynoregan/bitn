Burra Schools were visited on Friday by representatives of the Education Department and Public Buildings Department to discuss with staff and parent bodies the proposals for the development of the two schools on the present site.  Proposals would involve replacing the accommodation for the High School and upgrading the original building for the Primary School.  Additional facilities would be included, to be used by the school and community groups.  The proposal is expected to go soon to the Public Works Standing Committee, and subject to approval and availability of funds to commence as soon as possible.
