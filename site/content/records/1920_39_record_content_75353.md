Tree Planting.  Mrs Lance Lewis, a prominent member of the National Tree Planting Association, spoke at a public meeting last Wednesday.  The Mayor S. Kellaway presided.

Her speech is reported at length.

Mr A.L. Walker suggested hard shelled almonds for Burra.  Finally a committee was suggested to formulate a scheme.  Dr Steele moved that the meeting was in favour of almond trees.

[This statement was corrected in the next issue of the paper: he moved that arrangements be in the hands of the committee and he said nothing about almond trees.]

Mr Fairchild said they grew quickly and withstood dry weather well.

Mrs Lewis said the family was prepared to plant almonds on either side of the approach to St Mary’s Church from both Kooringa and Aberdeen.

Cr E. Finch said the District Council had in 1938 provided 350 trees to the Hanson District and 350 in 1939.  Booborowie got 50 in each year and Copperhouse 50 in 1939.

J.R. Barker promised further trees for the eastern approach to Burra.

The Hawkes family promised more for the Adelaide Road and the Mayor 20 in memory of his parents.
