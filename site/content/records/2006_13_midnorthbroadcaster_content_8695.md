Football.  At the NEFL Grand Final Peter Man was awarded the man of the match award, but it could have gone to strong marking half forward Jason Schuppan, or the courageous on-baller Andrew Purchase.  Schuppan kicked four of the Rams six goals in the opening three quarters.  Marcus Hall and Mark Phin were also among the best. Aaron Spicer also did well and 15-year-old talent Tom Whittlesea also impressed.  [Pictured: BBH Captain Stephen Tohl & Coach Peter Whittlesea with the shield.]
