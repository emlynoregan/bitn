Gala Weekend

The Police Band provided music at the Town Hall on Friday night for the Gala Ball.  There was an abundant supper and door takings amounted to £82.  On Saturday Mr R.V. Mueller marshalled the procession, which was led by the Police Greys and the Police Band.  Amusing and ingenious floats followed with cycles and fancy dress etc.  [Entries are listed.]  At the oval the Mayor E.T. Baulderstone welcomed everyone and introduced Inspector S.N. Smith to open the event.  There were displays by the Police Vaulting Team and Police horses.  Races were run for children and there were other events.  Results of the fancy dress section are printed.

The Police Concert in the Town Hall that evening drew a capacity crowd and on the following morning their appearance at the Hospital was much appreciated, after which the Mayor entertained them at a barbecue luncheon.  £220 was raised for the Town Oval by the weekend.
