Burra Burra Hospital Board recently resolved to accept a draft constitution to incorporate the hospital under the SA Health Commission Act.  It is proposed to hold a public meeting in March to recommend that the Hospital accept this constitution and become incorporated under the SA Health Commission Act.  The majority of hospitals in SA are incorporated under this act.  The benefits of the move are seen to be:

1.  Standardisation of operational guidelines and procedures.

2.  Improved legal representation by the SA Health Commission.

3.  Improved portability for staff for long service and sick leave entitlements etc. and the hospital will thus be better able to attract staff from other incorporated hospitals and Government Departments.

4.  Improved communications with the Commission.

5.  No loss of ownership of the Hospital by the Board.  It will remain under the ownership and control of the Community through an elected Board of Directors.

6.  Better working relationship with the SA Health Commission.

Points against:

1.  Once so incorporated the situation cannot be reversed.

2.  The Central Bureaucracy gains more power over the Hospital and can more easily direct what services the Hospital can or cannot provide â€“ but it already has this power to direct services in all Public Hospitals through the budget process.
