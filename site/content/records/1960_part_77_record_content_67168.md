Burra Burra DC.  Action will be taken against cyclists on footpaths.  Mr & Mrs Andrew Tennant were in Burra last week and advised that a Town Clock had been donated and will be erected in the near future.  The Chairman Cr W. Brown expressed the District’s thanks.  The exact site for the clock has still to be determined.

Council has asked the Highways & Local Government Department for permission to erect signage concerning historical sites on the approaches to the town.

The previous assessment has been adopted again with the necessary changes.

Council has agreed to accept ownership of the Mt Bryan Recreation Grounds and will lease them to the Mt Bryan Cricket Club on a yearly basis.

Council’s contribution to the Fire Brigade costs will rise by 50%.

Rising wages are also causing concern, with a rise of $7,000 to $8,000 expected in the coming year.

Flinders University has enquired concerning access roads to blocks it owns in the Hundred of Rees, Hallett in connection with an experimental station to be opened by them.
