Solomon Williams: Some More Reminiscences

He recalls the 1850s or thereabouts by constructing an imaginary conversation between two old timers recalling the early days.

One recalls boys learning to swim in the Burra Creek at the top end of Aberdeen in a fairly good pool about four feet deep with a sandy bottom.  He went up there with W.H. Skewes from the smelting works.  They had chosen this pool over the closer pool near the Mine Store because it was less public and in those days no one wore bathing costumes.  Also the other pool was muddy and a favourite place for drowning dogs.

One recalls also John Beal ‘roper’ at the mine who was an old sailor who made a model of a full-rigged ship which he sailed on the pool near the Mine Store, setting the helm so that it would sail in a curve and return to shore.  Mr Beal owned a Newfoundland dog named ‘Flo’ who would carry his hot dinner to him.

He recalls Burton’s Circus with its big tent before they had heard of entertainments like football, tennis, golf, hockey, lacrosse and talkies.  They played a very different game of cricket.  There were no stumps, only an old tin and they had a pick-handle for a bat, or fashioned one chopped out of any old board.  They also played rounders and ‘warmers’ using a soft ball made by themselves.  They would wind string or worsted yarn around a cork and then sew or knit a cover over it using buttonhole stitch.

One remembers yabbying at Princess Royal with Jack, Jim & George Merrett who lived near the cemetery and had formerly lived at Springbank where other early families had been Bosence, Rowe, Baggs, Mosey and Berryman.  He also remembers when a boy named Knevett was lost for some days in foggy cold weather on Sugar Loaf Hill and died from exposure.  He was a bearer at the funeral along with other boys.  It was a long way to carry the coffin from the Catholic Church to the cemetery.  All coffins were then hand-carried to the cemetery except for the Welsh who had a table with an edge to hold the coffin from slipping and carried it on their shoulders.  The custom was to sing all the way to the grave.

One remembers the felling of the large trees along the creek and of swallows nests in them.  The other talks of birds making bottle-shaped nests from little nodules of mud and says they were Fairy Martins not swallows.
