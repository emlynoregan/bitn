Burra Hospital Board met 24 August

It was resolved to alter Rule 8 so that two Medical Officers could be appointed on equal footing.  (Dr Steele was excluded from this portion of the meeting.)

Notice was received from the Local Board of Health giving 24 hours to clean up the Isolation Ward.

Mr Melrose explained what had led up to the offer of himself and Mrs Barker for a Maternity Ward and outline how far matters had progressed.  The Chief Secretary is to be advised the Board has no objection to the Maternity Wardâ€™s going ahead.
