Burra Town Council

There has been no reply yet from the Government on the Waterworks request.

The cricket club wants sheep to be let in to ‘mow’ the oval.  The Mayor is concerned that last time they damaged the trees.  It was left to the Town Clerk and Cr Harris to see to the mowing.

The Mayor said Jubilee Fountain has been taken down for safety.

The committee has no further funds to re-erect it.

The Council will apply for a reduction in the rent of their room at the Institute, which is currently £20 p.a.

Burra limestone has been found to be an excellent flux at Broken Hill, but carriage on the railways is uneconomic.  The stuff could be supplied if carriage was £6 per truck or lower.  The matter will be referred to the district MPs for action.
