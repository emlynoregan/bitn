Joyce Lloyd has been named Burra Ward Citizen of the Year.  Joyce was born on the family farm ten miles out from Burra in 1924 and after attending Ayers School she left at the age of 14 to work on the farm, as her brothers were at the war.  She attended weekly lectures at Leighton Hall for first aid and emergency services and she knitted socks, balaclavas, jumpers, mittens and scarves to send to soldiers and made home made pasties for the Burra sheep sales to raise money for the Red Cross.  Joyce married Ray Lloyd in 1948 and they moved to a farm six miles from Burra.  She was an office bearer at the Hanson CWA in the 1960s until it closed and then transferred her membership to the Burra branch until it too closed.  Joyce has given many floral art demonstrations in the wider district – at Hanson, Burra, Farrell Flat, Clare, Spalding, Booborowie, Hallett, Jamestown and Willalo.  The Burra Burra DC also asked the Burra Floral Art Club to exhibit a floral display in Victoria Square as part of the Adelaide Flower festival.  Mrs Lloyd belonged to the Club in Burra and taught floral art from the 1960s to the present day.  She regularly provided floral arrangements for school speech nights at the Town Hall and for other occasions.  She has been a member of the Farrell Flat Golf Club until the couple moved to Burra in 1972 and is a current member of the Burra Golf Club, in which she has held a variety of offices, including that of President.  She has won the Championship four times and continued to play pennants till four years ago.  She was Zone President of the Mid North Ladies Gold Union for two years and has played most of the Adelaide courses.  She assisted Jim Richards in teaching young golfers – meeting them at the golf club at 8 a.m. on Saturday mornings throughout the winter months.  Since 1974 she has been a member of the Burra Bowling Club where she has been President and a selection committee member.  She won the championship twice along with many other competitions and currently plays in the pennant team.  She has been involved in the Burra Op Shop, the Burra Market Square Museum, the Burra art Gallery, China Painting Classes.  She has also been closely involved with theBurra Show Society and the Clare show with both entries and judging in a range of sections including flowers, needlework, cooking, china and floral art.  For more than 50 years she has provided floral decorations for weddings and receptions and made bridal bouquets and buttonholes.  She has taught many to knit, tat, crochet and cook and remains a keen gardener.  [Photo]
