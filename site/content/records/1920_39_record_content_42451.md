Burra Town Council, 4 July

The Town Clerk will discuss with Mr Tuck the location of trees to be planted on the school’s Arbor Day.

W. Marshall was granted permission to erect a small shelter for a cow in the park opposite Ridgeway’s Row.

A.A. Nankivell had his lease on certain parklands renewed.

The Town Clerk reported 4 or 5 carriers (all the principal ones) had applied for licences and paid the fees.

Cr Bevan raised the matter of a load of rotting rabbit carcases that were thrown on the edge of the road after being condemned.  Action will be taken to prevent a repetition.
