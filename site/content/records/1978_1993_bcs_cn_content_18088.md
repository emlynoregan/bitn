Staff Profile: Beverley Priest

I have a contract position to teach Year 12 Australian History, Secondary Human Society, Maths and Special Education.  I also take some Personal Development Classes and several R-6 DOTT (Duties other than teaching) lessons.  I live at Point Pass with my husband who teaches at Eudunda and we have three daughters.  My interests include tennis, Swimming, music (especially flute) and craft.

The Year 12 students, as part of their SAS Australian Studies will be undertaking a Market Square survey.  This will update a 1984 survey.
