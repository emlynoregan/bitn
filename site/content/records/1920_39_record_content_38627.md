The Transport Control Board sat at Booborowie and posed the problem that the railways were losing £1,500,000 and road carriers were taking from £5,000 to £10,000 a year away from them in some districts.  Could the state afford to pay for two systems of transport?  Could Booborowie be served by a feeder road service from the Burra railway station?

Three columns of evidence are then presented from:

G.W. Gunn: the savings by road were vital.

W.S. McEvoy: motor service to the abattoirs is vital.

L.L. Gill (storekeeper): the road service was much more economical and convenient.

W. Harding (hotel-keeper): using the railway cost 23/- a ton more.

A.W. Pearce (storekeeper): road delivery cost as much as rail delivery to Burra, before adding the extra charge to Booborowie.  Fruit and vegetables came on Monday by the cabbage train and 60 cans of cream a week were railed from Burra and Andrews.  The big problem with the railways was the high charge for loads under 4 tons – 4 tons of seed went to Melbourne for £4-4-0 a ton, but half a ton went to Ballarat for £3-18-0.

Cr Davies of Canowie DC: both wool and sheep went cheaper by road.

P.A. Kilderry: railway freight increases in 1926 had spurred road use.

W. Lomman: did not use rail and got his flour from Jamestown.

O.J. Lynch: did not believe in interference in road traffic and could do away with rail even to move wheat.

P.F. Carmody: was dissatisfied with the poor rail service at Andrews. (Two trains a week.)

Mr Wedding: stopped using rail when they charged him demurrage on an old machine he could not collect for a few days.

A.R. Groverman (blacksmith): used road for everything as a purely economic decision.  Too often parcels did not arrive when expected by rail.

Wilfred Kain (farmer): lorry was not cheaper, but was better for small consignments of stock.

E.E. Gill (pig farmer of Spalding): used road service to Jamestown.

The Chairman said they had to consider closing the Clare-Spalding line or the Riverton-Spalding line.

Mr Gill said he was for rail to carry super and wheat were road could not compete.  The line was vital for wheat.

G.G. Hallett of Spalding (manufacturer): he sent stuff all over Australia and found the railways useless for state delivery.  He asked the railway for preferential rates, but they were only available for guarantees of so many tons.
