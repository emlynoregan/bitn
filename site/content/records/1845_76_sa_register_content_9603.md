Court, Kooringa, 9 January, before T.H. Mayne JP

John Macdonald was charged with having stolen an order from James Eade on 8 January.  He had been drinking with the prisoner and had given him an order for something over £6 to pay for the drinks and to bring him the change.  Eade had left the hotel without returning the change.

John Barkwell said that yesterday the prisoner had been in a fight and his shirt was torn so lent him my coat.  This morning I went and got my coat and having heard of the dispute over the order I gave it to another man standing nearby and told him to search it for anything not belonging to me.  He found nothing.  When I put the coat on the prisoner came up, saying he was looking for a pipe.  Someone said the prisoner had then put something in the pocket and I had better give it to the policeman.  Took the coat off and gave it to the policeman.

John Bestie, policeman had information about the alleged offence and arrived as Barkwell was taking off his coat.  Searched the coat and found two orders rolled up in a ball in the pocket to value of £6-0-10.

John Benjamin said the prisoner had bought a shirt from him the previous day and gave him an order for £6-6-0.  He believed the two orders produced were those he gave as change.

John Macdonald claimed that he and Eade were both drunk, but Eade was the worse.  Eade had given him the £6-6-0 order and told him to pay for two nobblers and to get a shirt.  I got the nobblers, but could not get change.  Went to Mr Benjamin’s and got the shirt and the two orders produced as change.  Then went behind an old bakehouse and went to sleep.  In the morning I went to the hotel and found Eade with others.  I was not then aware that I had not given him the change.  Committed for trial.
