Mr Scammel said they were not there to impose restrictions, but rather to ask citizens to co-operate and so far schemes already initiated in other areas were going well.  They were not concerned with private cars because owners of them would not get new tyres when the present set wore out.  The question of car tyres was that used tyres were of little value â€“ thousands were currently awaiting treatment.  Cars had to be kept on the road in case they were needed for emergency troop movement.  Car tyres were not suitable for heavier use anyway.

S. Hawker said that in this area utilities were widely used and they did use car tyres, so why were city people within half a mile of trams still driving cars.  And what of cars on blocks?  Their tyres were just rotting.

Mr McMillan confirmed that the Act they operated under did not have the power to limit the use of private cars.

Mr Bednall said almost everyone here had priority four rating, which meant no new tyres, so they would have to develop a plan for district transport.  There were two main things to consider: firstly the transport of wool and wheat and secondly dairy produce.  He hoped a voluntary scheme would work.

A.D. Sellars said the article on 22 June created a false impression that where three trucks or buckboards ran there would be one in the future.

The editor maintained that that was so and Sir Richard Butler has used almost the same terms.

Mr Sellars pointed out that only a few carriers did all the moving of wheat, wool etc. and if they did not get tyres it would be impossible.

Mr Scammel said they had learnt of the importance of utilities.

Mr McMillan also said recommendations from a local committee would exceed priority numbers.

The question of wood carting should be tackled at once.
