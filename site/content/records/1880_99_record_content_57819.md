‘Ratepayer’ writes condemning strongly the activities of the Town Council in meeting behind closed doors.  He refers to the audacity and effrontery of a person [Cr Rabbich] asking respectable ratepayers to leave the room.  He mentions several examples of expenditure he clearly feels were injudicious.

The Dayman’s pay was increased from 6/- to 6/6 a day.

The Inspector’s salary was reduced from £60 to £50 and the job given to R. Snell.  Then confusion set in and the decision was cancelled and the job given to Mr Gray at the old salary of £60.

Then there was the fiasco of the Hawkers By-Law.

And the awarding of a kerbing contract to Messrs Launder & Co. despite Mr Roger’s lower tender.

The writer then recounts the events of the Waterworks and the appeal by the Engineer to Cr Harris for wood.  Surely either the Waterworks Committee or the Council is guilty of neglect in not seeing that there was a supply of wood on hand.
