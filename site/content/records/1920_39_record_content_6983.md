Burra Town Council, 20 February

Plans for the Fire Station were received.

Tenders to be called for building only.

The Soldiers’ Memorial inscription plates will be in place in about four weeks.

Mr James says yards and troughs to convert the Smelts to a pound cost £20 and he would be willing to act as pound-keeper for £20 p.a. – it was not worth doing it for less.

Cr Collins said the pound fees were sufficient remuneration and the matter was left in abeyance.
