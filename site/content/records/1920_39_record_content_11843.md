T. James had an accident while cultivating near Hanson on 13 October.  He turned his team abruptly breaking swings etc. and causing the seven-horse team to panic.  They bolted straight over a 15 ft sheer drop into a creek.  Amazingly they all survived with only one slightly hurt.  It was however, difficult to get them out of the narrow creek.
