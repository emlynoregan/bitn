Witness 8.  K. Sparrow

In charge of Burra Police Station

At least two of the three hotels had an illegal bookmaker.

At least one operated on the street on race days.

About 30 people gathered in each of the hotels on Saturdays in the main bar.

Illegal betting would stop if there were a betting shop.

Little if any betting was carried out in hotel lounges by women.

A registered betting shop would be easier to police.
