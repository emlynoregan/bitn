Nathaniel O’Brien has recently returned from the 2011 Tamworth Country Music Festival where he achieved 2nd place in the Melinda Schneider Idol Competition.  Melinda has since offered him a spot as support act when she next performs in SA.  After a year off to allow for vocal changes Nathaniel has had a successful return with six wins, two seconds and a third and taking out the Capital Country Music Association 2011 Talent Quest in the Best Country Duet section.  He also won this trophy in 2007 with sister Tracey Rains.  At the Manilla Country Music Festival (40 km from Tamworth) Nathaniel won five of five sections in Junior Vocal, Junior Gospel, Country Rock, Gospel and Open Duet and was second overall.  He was also third in the Aristocrats competition from 60 other emerging stars from Australia & New Zealand.  Nathaniel is 15 and will attend the Camerata Academy of Country Music in July after winning the Junior Champs for SA.
