Public Notice.  Thomas W. Pearce published a letter from W.L. H. Bruse of 3 April in which the latter advises that he will not in future let his hearse at all and gives notice of this in time to allow Mr Pearce to buy one of his own.

Mr Pearce publishes this letter in order that ‘the public will see the jealousy therein’.  He then says that he will continue to offer his services as an undertaker etc.
