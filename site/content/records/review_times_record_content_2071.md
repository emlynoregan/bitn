Burra Lions Club.  A move is to be made to form a Lions Club in Burra.  Two members of Lions from other districts, but now living in Burra, Bob Burns and Mick King, have instigated the move.  More than 20 persons have so far indicated interest and a meeting will now be held in the Burra RSL Clubrooms on 19 April to be attended by Mr Harold Gilbert, Lions Extension Chairman from Adelaide.
