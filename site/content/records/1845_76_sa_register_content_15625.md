Kooringa News, 7 May

Rev. J.G. Paton preached on Sunday at the United Presbyterian Church on behalf of the mission cause amongst the New Hebrides Islands.  In the afternoon there was a grand alliance meeting of the Sunday schools in the Bible Christian Chapel.  This brought together scholars of the Wesleyans, Presbyterians, Primitive Methodists and Bible Christians.  The chapel was densely crowded with children and other visitors.  Rev. Paton delivered an earnest and somewhat lengthy address on the subject of missions.  In the evening he preached at the Wesleyan Chapel and a local committee has been formed for the purpose of aiding the cause.

Election placards are now everywhere and canvassing is going on so that tomorrow’s election is likely to be brisk and exciting.  Yesterday evening a meeting of Mr Stocks’s supporters was called at the Burra Hotel, but it turned out to be a burlesque rather than a reality.
