Mokota Conservation Park

A controlled burn of 30 ha was trialled to investigate how best to control/reduce pest plants and increase the health and vigour of native grasses in the 455 ha park.  Dense ground cover had built up since the park was acquired in 1999, suppressing native grass regrowth and encouraging pest species.  Mokota is unusual among the stateâ€™s Conservation Parks because it is purely grassland.  The dominant species is iron grass (Lomandra multiflora) and it also has two nationally endangered species; the small scurf pea (Cullen parvum) and trailing hopbush (Dodonea procumbens).
