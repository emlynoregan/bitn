Burra Red Cross held its AGM 10 July.  The 1944-45 year was reported as most satisfactory, with membership up to 83 from 68.  The main source of income has been from the Burra Red Cross Shop and FF Unit 109.  Mrs Kellock as Secretary of the Shop is doing a wonderful job.  The most outstanding effort for the year was the Queen Competition for the Annual Drive, when Mrs M. Pearce kindly consented to be nominated as Queen.

During the year, long service medals were presented: Mrs E.F. Marston (18 years as Secretary) and to Mesdames J. Tennant, O. Finch, G. Herbert, A. Clark, J. Barker, A. Davey, L.M. Gordon, W. Finch, S.M. Sandland, E. McLaren, G. Hawkes and Miss Barker.

Elected: President, Mrs D.M. Steele; Vice-Presidents, Mrs S.M. Sandland & Mrs J. Barker; Secretary, Mrs R. Jeffery & Treasurer, Mrs G.H. Tiver.
