Cr Radford and Cr Walker will get a petition signed.

The Mayor said the bridge at the Pig and Whistle needed attention.  The Public Works Committee has it in hand.  The footway on the Kingston St Bridge should be asphalted.

Cr Lane said he understood that some people had moved into Paxton Square without permission.
