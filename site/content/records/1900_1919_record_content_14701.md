Vice-Captain		F.T. Harcus

Secretary		Rev. Father Redden

Subscription: 5/- p.a.

The secretaryâ€™s report for 1904-05 season is printed.  It recounts the history of the club in recent years.

1901-02	A successful year

1902-03	Quite dead

1903-04	As good as dead, but with one foolish and ill-fated effort

1904-05	10 matches played of which 7 were won, 2 lost and 1 drawn.

Much is due to F.T. Harcus for his enthusiasm and also for top aggregate of 306 and highest score of 88 for an average of 51.  Best bowling figures went to F.H. Clare with 15 for 155 at an average of 7.6, followed by J.I. Sangster with 19 for 177 at an average of 9.3.

Finance was difficult and the books only balance due to a donation of 10/- each from Dr Sangster jun., Father Redden and Messrs Drew, Harcus and A. Gebhardt.
