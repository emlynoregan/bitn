22 October 1873, page 7

The English & Australian Copper Co.

The half-yearly meeting was held 28 August.  Mr R.A. Routh chaired the meeting.  The chairman said no doubt shareholders would be disappointed.  At the time of the last meeting the Directors had hoped to present a healthy credit balance instead of there being a debit.  He said they would not really know the company’s situation until a full stocktaking at the end of the full year.  A considerable quantity of ore had been taken into the accounts at cost price, but the profits of which would not come in until the second half.  One problem had been that three quarters of the ore purchased had been acquired during the interruption to the telegraph cable.  The manager expected that the business for 1873-74 was likely to be more than double that for 1872-73 and copper prices had been rising.  The workings to 31 December 1872 showed a deficiency of £3,676-4-4 and that would almost absorb the balance of undistributed profit brought forward.
