T.G. Perry, District Clerk writes to say the Council has instructed him to advise that they strongly support the proposal of Samin Ltd to rework the Burra Mine.  During the work it is expected as many of the historic buildings will be preserved as possible.  The Council will continue to be in touch with the project, as the mine is on Council property.  Council appreciates State Government support through the Department of Mines and the project is a practical application of continued support for country areas.  Councillors are in touch with local opinion, which supports the new project.
