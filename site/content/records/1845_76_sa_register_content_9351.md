W.R, Carmichael, medical practitioner said he believed the deceased died of apoplexy.  Being predisposed to apoplexy, the fall hastened his death.  Apoplexy can be brought on by excessive drinking.

Constable William O’Shaughnessy gave evidence of being called to Nankervis’s to see the body.  The face appeared to be downwards, and when the body was turned over, the nose was flattened, and the cheeks were swollen and purple on both sides.

The verdict was death from apoplexy, the fall from the horse combined with the effects of intemperance, being the immediate cause.
