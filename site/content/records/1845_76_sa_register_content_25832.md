A Trip Through the Northern Areas

The road towards the Broughton from Collingsfield is like a wet ploughed field, but it has a hard bottom.  [The writer describes a well cultivated landscape hereabouts.]

Though the crops looked very promising the houses of settlers were poor and miserably built with no attempts at gardens.  The shelters for horses were very crude and agricultural implements were strewn all about.  Fences were rough crooked posts with two wires strained through them.  Do the farmers see themselves as merely temporary visitors in this landscape?

Between Broughton and Crystal Brook the agricultural country continues and it is largely flat with water courses lined with large trees.  From Crystal Brook to Stony River is promising for agriculture.  Stony River has a post office/store and a few houses.  The gate of Bowman’s Paddock is reached about 12 miles from Pt Pirie.  This is well grassed open country.  Pt Pirie is a long irregular group of weatherboard houses along the bank of a salt creek, with jetties running into the stream at several points.  Opposite is a thick mass of mangroves.   Granted some good years and it will grow into a proper town with a mayor and Corporation by 1880.  The main street now is about as soft as a load of silt.  There are four commodious wheat stores with jetties and Magarey & Co.’s new mill is an extensive establishment four storeys high and just started work.  The National Bank has a branch and the telegraph wires have arrived, but as yet no instrument to work the service.
