Obituary.  Robson Urwin, father of J. Urwin of Kooringa died at Bowden on 27 January 1920 aged 60.  The deceased had long business connections with Burra, first with his brother, Leonard, dating back over 30 years.  They began in premises next to the Commercial Hotel and later occupied more commodious premises occupied for many years by Messrs J. & E. Hosking.  He carried on business there under the supervision of a manager for some time.  When his sons were able they took over the firm of R. Urwin & Sons and Mr J. Urwin has been in charge for many years.  Messrs Robson Jun. and Harry Urwin run the Bowden branch.  The deceased leaves a widow and three grandchildren.
