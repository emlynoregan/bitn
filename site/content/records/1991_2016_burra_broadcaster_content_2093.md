Burra High School Students held a reunion at the Sports Complex on the weekend.  Nearly 150 old scholars and their partners attended from many parts of SA and some from interstate.  A visit was arranged to BCS, where present scholars acted as guides.  Photocopies of school registers were displayed in the Library along with other memorabilia.

Former staff members present were Reuben Goldsworthy, Bethel Smith and Alan Hickinbotham.  Alan was here in 1942 and told of trench digging and aeroplane spotting.  The group was welcomed by one of the organisers, Ray McInnis and by the Burra Burra DC Chairman, Graham Kellock.
