Burra Cycle Race

This year is the 99th anniversary of the first Burra Cycle Race.  The Norwood Cycling Club will return next weekend for this yearâ€™s event.  The first race was in 1907 from Burra to Adelaide and the time of 6 hours 11 minutes was quite fast considering the then state of the roads.

[The article goes on to provide further information on the race and participants over the years, but it is not specific about when things occurred or the times or the winners.]
