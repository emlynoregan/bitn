Burra Town Council 20 October.

Cr Marston asked whether the Mayor had any jurisdiction concerning the people coming to Burra under the Mayorâ€™s housing scheme and whether it was true that some had had their residences in the city condemned when they did live in the city.

The Mayor replied that he had no say in the persons being sent to Burra and to the best of his knowledge none had left condemned houses.

Cr Harvey said he had dealt with a number of the people referred to and had no complaints.
