A.B. Riggs writes concerning a decision to buy a reproduction of Captain Longstaff’s famous painting of the Menin Gate at Midnight, the original of which hangs in the Australian War Memorial.  It costs £10-10-0 and public subscriptions are sought.  When a centre buys one of the limited reproductions the names of those from the district who died in this battle are listed on the back.  The four Burra names on this picture are Harris, Finch, Hawkes & Fuss.  [It would seem that the deceased were Horace Harris (died 20 September 1917, William George Finch (died 6 October 1917 and Waldemar Robert Hawkes (died 29 October 1917), but the Fuss is a mystery, as none of the locally enlisted Fuss soldiers seems to have died in WWI.]
