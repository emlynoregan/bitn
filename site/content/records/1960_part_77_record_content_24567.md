Burra Town Council Elections

E.T. Baulderstone was re-elected for the twelfth consecutive year in Council.  This also means he has been 20 consecutive years in Council.  He first took his seat for East Ward in July 1946 and became Mayor in July 1954.

Mr T.H. Woollacott served 14 years as Mayor, but in two periods 1931-37 and 1940-46.

[This is in fact only 12Â½ years.  Until 1936 elections were for a calendar year and the term of office ran from December to November.  Subsequently the term was for the financial year July-June.  T.H. Woollacott was elected in December 1931 and effectively served as Mayor in 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936 and half of 1937 and later for 39/40, 40/41, 41/42, 42/43, 43/44, 44/45 & 45/46.]

E.W. Crewes was Mayor for 11 years in three periods.  [1900-02, 1914-19 & 1921-22.]

When nominations closed on Friday:

Cr R.J. Jeffery was returned for North Ward, Cr C.L. Phillips for West Ward and Mr Ken Williams replaces Cr R. Broad in East Ward.
