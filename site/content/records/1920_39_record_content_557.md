Burra Town Council

The price of Post Office boxes in Kooringa has been reduced from Â£1 to 10/- p.a.

The Town Clerk is directed to draft a by-law prohibiting more than one person from riding on a motor-cycle within the boundaries of the Corporation.

Cr Broderick said there were 17-18 lights to be attended to and he thought too much time was allowed for it.  A man was allowed 4 hours off every time he lit the lamps.

The inspector said it took a good bit of time to light them and it was unpleasant, especially in winter.  It was hard to get someone to do the job at all and he did not think they would get a man to do it after his regular work.
