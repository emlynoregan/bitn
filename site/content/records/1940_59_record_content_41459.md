L.P. Bence.  A portrait in French pastels of Mrs L.P. Bence is now being exhibited with the Melrose Prize winner in the Adelaide Art Gallery – about 40 out of hundreds submitted were hung.  Mr Bence’s only tuition was from his art teacher at St Peter’s College.  Miss D. Geake of Burra is now teaching Mr Bence in the use of oils.  Miss Geake has received numerous awards for her work from exhibitions as far away as London.
