Miss Mabel’s Cottage has been refurbished by owners Rosemary & Phil Brook of Adelaide.  They bought the cottage two years ago and have travelled to Burra at weekends to do up their purchase.  It is now ready to be opened as a B & B.  The 1855 vintage cottage is located in Burra’s Welsh township of Llwchwr.  Miss Mabel was born in the cottage in 1883 as the twelfth of thirteen children born to Samuel and Ann Baker, who moved into the cottage in 1862.  She continued to live there until shortly before her death in 1983.  Phil Brook is a joiner by trade and Rosemary a chef before coming to Australia from Yorkshire.
