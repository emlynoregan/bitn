H.J. Button writes condemning T.H. Woollacott for what he describes as an unwarranted attack on himself at the Ratepayers’ Meeting.  He fails to see any sign of ‘muck’ as Mr Woollacott talked about.  He apparently failed to understand that Button was not opposed to Johnny Green’s preservation, but only to his siting.  It is all the stranger he says since Woollacott came to him a few days earlier and agreed that Johnny Green was on the wrong site.
