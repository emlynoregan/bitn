M. MacDermott writes from Kooringa 1 June:

Last Friday Captain Gregor, a mining agent, found some fossil bones in a small creek about half a mile from the Burra Cemetery.  He recovered part of a lower jaw with four double teeth.  The teeth measure 2½ inches across the top surface in either direction.  From the insertion of the teeth to the bottom of the jaw was five inches.  A smaller piece of jaw without teeth and some other bones were also recovered.  I saw the bones at Captain Gregor’s cottage and went to the discovery site.  They came from a clay bed six feet under the bank.  It is highly desirable that the bones be brought to the attention of the Adelaide Museum and a skilled person be sent to extract further specimens.

[The Register’s Burra correspondent also reports Captain Gregor’s discovery, giving similar details.]
