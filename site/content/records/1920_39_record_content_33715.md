RSL, AGM was held 7 March in the Club Room with President H.G. Oates in the chair.

The President’s Report stated that despite the bad economic conditions membership had increased by 18.  Though the year had operated profitably to the degree of £2-15-8 the bank balance had actually fallen from £67-13-7 to £27-4-8 due to paying off old accounts that were carried forward from previous years.  The nett profit on the dance had been £30-12-1.  Several successful smoke socials were held.  Major Copley gave an interesting lecture on his overland trip to Darwin.  A successful fund was established to aid the late Augie Brandt.  Cash donations totalled £154-19-0.  Accounts for £68-5-7 were written off.  Patriotic Societies contributed £21-10-0 and the SA Soldiers’ Fund made a substantial weekly payment, a smaller part of which continues to his widow.  The total benefit was about £300.  The President thanked all for the splendid attendance of 30.

Elected were President, H.G. Oates; Vice-Presidents, R.C. Sexton, W. Anderson & L.M. Gordon; Treasurer, J.F. Stephen of the Commercial Bank; Secretary, G.H. Dow.

A motion was passed to get the quorum at general or special general meetings reduced from 20 to 10.

On the question of forming an Employment Bureau the matter was not of great importance in Burra at present.  Of the 66 members 32 were in primary production, 20 were engaged in business, 14 were labourers and 2 were unemployed.  Of non-members on the Honour Roll a rough count suggested that 6 were in business, 33 in primary production and 31 were labourers.  A number of the last group were unemployed.  If we have another bad year the question will arise and he suggested a sub-committee to deal with unemployment and to form an Employment Bureau if possible.

Mr Carpenter said 2,000 returned men were on unemployed lists in the city at the Labour Bureau.

The suggestion was carried.

The Burra Rifle Club wrote asking if the RSL objected to their having an all-day match on 25 April.  No objection was raised.
