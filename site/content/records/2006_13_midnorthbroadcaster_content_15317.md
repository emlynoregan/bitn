Lewis Family Reunion

Eighty-five descendants of the Hon. John Lewis came from all over the world for a family reunion in Burra last weekend.

John Lewis [born 1842 at Brighton SA] was privately educated until age 12 when he began working on the family farm at Balaklava.  At 14 he ran away from home to become an apprentice blacksmith at Meadows before working on stations throughout SA.  In 1872 he went to the NT where he obtained a lease on the Coburg Peninsula.  He was commissioned by the Government as a courier between the construction parties on the northern and southern ends of the Overland Telegraph.  He organised prospecting expeditions and Pine Creek Gold Reef was the chief find.  On returning to SA he married Martha Anne Brook [September 1876] and they settled at Burra where with William Lister and James Shakes they formed the stock and station agency of Bagot, Shakes and Lewis.  He conducted huge stock sales, once disposing of 47,000 sheep and 1,200 cattle.  He served for three years in the [Town Council: December 1879-November 1981].  He was prominent in local organisations.  The family had six children:

James Brook Lewis: a surgeon who also worked in Gwalior with geologist Herbert Hoover, late US President.

Gilbert Norman Lewis.

Essington Lewis.

Eleanor [Mary] Lewis.
