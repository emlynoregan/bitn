Burra Cheer-up Society

On 7 January the Ladies’ band and a multitude of others welcomed home Pte Fred Wheatley & Tpr Billy Dow, Pte Brown and Pte L. McGowan.  The first two were away over four years and the latter two just a little less.

On 9 January the Ladies’ band etc. greeted the return of Pte W. Sellars.

The Band is getting a smart uniform. (A crème dress.)

The Society will help the committee headed by Miss Hawkes to furnish the RSL Room.
