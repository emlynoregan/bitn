Ben Kotz was presented with a long service certificate to Burra RSL Sub Branch at a small gathering of RSL Members and his family at Holder Home Burra yesterday morning.  His daughter Marilyn Heyer of Adelaide came for the occasion, and so did niece Maryann Thamm of Burra.  Mr Kotz has been secretary of the local sub-branch for longer than anyone can remember.  Mr Kotz, 92, said he joined the RSL on returning from WW II in 1945.  Sub-Branch President John Trigg presented the certificate for an outstanding contribution to the Burra RSL Sub-Branch and service to the community and to the interests of ex-servicemenâ€™s welfare.
