Booborowie Railway.  100 met at Willalo Hall on Tuesday 23 March [sic] [Presumably really 23 Feb.] to confer with railway officials about the proposed line either from Hanson (23 miles) or from Yakilo Junction on the Spalding line (17 miles).  The Comptroller of Accounts, John Pickering, gave figures suggesting the Hanson line would lose a small amount each year of c. Â£600.  The Hanson route gave the better outlet to Adelaide and also to get livestock to the Burra Markets or to send hay and chaff to the north.  (For this last purpose it was 100 miles better.)  It is also the easier route for construction.  The meeting unanimously endorsed a Hanson-Booborowie railway.
