Mt Bryan School had a working bee last Saturday to work on air raid shelters for the school children.  About 30 men turned out to construct the shelters on the Hall property.  The covering work will be done next Saturday.

Burra Civil Defence Committee advises that a try-out for Air Raid Precautions will be held between 2 and 3 p.m. on Saturday 18 April.  [Instructions occupy almost one column.]
