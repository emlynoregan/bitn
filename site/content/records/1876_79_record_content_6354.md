Advt. First Appearance of the Burra amateur Dramatic society in aid of The Burra Hospital. At the Institute, Thursday 15 May, featuring `The Fall of Wolsey' in full dress costume. Also Music, Vocals and Instrumentals by Lady Amateurs.

Misses Belcher, Bock, A. Fuss, B. Fuss, Giles, Harris & H. White. [A. Fuss was probably Alvine (sometimes Elvine) and B. Fuss was probably Bertha, though Elvine would have been not quite 12.]

Concluding with the laughable farce `Comedy of Marriage'.
