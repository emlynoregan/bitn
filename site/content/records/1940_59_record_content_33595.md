Senator O’Flaherty visited Burra on Monday last week and spoke on a range of topics, but especially on the nationalisation of banking, of which he was much in favour.  The meeting was not well attended.  He spoke of a continuing need for some forms of price control – as in establishing a base price for wool and wheat.  He also spoke on taxation to redistribute incomes and of assistance to hospitals.  He then addresses the issue of the banks and the benefits to the Government and the country of nationalisation.
