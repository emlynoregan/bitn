The Agriculture exhibits were very competitive.

Dairy products suffered from a bad season, though the bacon and hams were of excellent quality.

Poultry produced some of the finest birds ever seen in Burra.

E.W. Crewes ‘scooped the pool’ with his fine lot of canaries in that section.

Horse entries were not numerous, but were of good quality.

Cattle produced some good quality competitors.

Ten greyhounds were prominent in the dog section.

Sheep were fairly well represented, but more could come from owners of flocks of under 2,000.

Pigs were better this year.

Implements were few.

Vegetables drew few competitors, but the quality was fine.  This section was dominated by C. Oppermann & S. Baker.

Flowers were better than ever.  Mrs A. Nykiel was the chief prize-taker.

[Personal interest: no mention of any Fuss entries this year.]

Cookery & needlework were rather neglected this year.

The School Class was well represented.

[Personal interest: Muriel Fuss got a 2nd for best finished plain sewing by a girl under 16.]

The evening concert was well patronised.
