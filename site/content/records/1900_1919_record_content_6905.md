The Mayor’s Report.

Mr Crewes expressed regret at the death of the late Mayor, Mr Alex. Harris and of the late Inspector, J.R. Gray, who had been replaced by Mr J.F.N. Martin, selected from 28 candidates.  The council had worked well and amicably in the last year.

Major Works:

East Ward: considerable kerbing and path forming in Kingston, Ayers and Bridge Sts and the bridges had been painted.  The trough in Market Square had been tarred and painted.  The pump had been repaired.  Footpaths in Kingston and Chapel Sts had been tar dressed etc. etc.

West Ward: considerable amount of tar dressing has been done in Chapel St, Queen St, & Commercial St.  The bridge in Church St was put in order etc. etc.

North Ward: footpath work in Truro and Ludgvan Sts and kerbing in Ludgvan and St Dye Sts.  A culvert at Roach Town was repaired as was a bridge in Sancreed St.  The Young St Ford was lowered to better carry floods and to drain stagnant water.  Footpath in Best Place was tar dressed.  Water trough opposite the Exchange Hotel was raised on new stands, tarred and painted etc. etc.

The Council began the year with a debit of £8-14-5 and at the last meeting was in credit £54-4-9.  The rates for the year had brought in £300-4-11.

North Ward lamps had cost £7-14-0 and those in East Ward £9-9-0 and West Ward lamps also cost £9-9-0.

In the parklands dead trees have been removed and replaced, but numbers of young trees have been deliberately pulled up and taken away by person or persons unknown.  Some trees have died due to the dry season.  Pepper trees planted opposite Jubilee Avenue have done well.  Altogether over 300 trees were planted during the year.

In the cemetery shrubs have been planted and the wall repaired.

Burra Waterworks.

The plant remains in good order with no breakdowns this year.  Much is due to the spare boiler and good work of the engineer, Mr Prior.  The present reservoir of 33,000 gallons is however, too small.  A larger one was considered this year, but deferred pending a Government response on the Black Waterholes supply.  The second lot of water for testing from that source has been condemned as unsuited for locomotives and so the scheme has had to be given up.  A new reservoir of 200,000 gallons would cost about £300 which would last the town several days and save on extra labour being needed in summer and could be financed without increasing the rates.  In the year Council tried to get the capital account and rates reduced, but were unsuccessful.  The plant is now valued at £8,104-11-10 and the rate is 4%.  Mr William Pryor is still in charge.  [Note: it was Prior earlier in the report.]  The balance in the bank is currently £74-3-11.
