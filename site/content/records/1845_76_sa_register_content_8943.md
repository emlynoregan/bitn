SA Mining

We noted in our last summary that work has recommenced at the Burra Burra Mine.  The operations have been steadily continued without any problems.  The number of hands employed is about 450.  The quality of ore being raised is about 23% copper, though much richer ore exists in the 40 fathom level.

The Kapunda Mine is also in full work.

During the last session of the Legislative Council legislation was passed to facilitate the winding up of Joint Stock Companies.  Several mining companies are taking advantage of this, taking steps to sell their land and dissolving the companies.  Among them are: North Kapunda Mining Co., the Greenock Creek Mining Co., the Breadalbane Mining Co., The Glenalbyn Mining Co., the Prince Albert Mining Co., the Adelaide Mining Co., the North Rhine Mining Co., the North Rhine Mining Association and the Outside Kapunda Land Company.

These sales will throw a considerable amount of land onto the market, more or less valuable for its mineral deposits.

The Echunga gold diggings are still being worked by a few diggers, who find their labour pays.  No second goldfield has been discovered.
