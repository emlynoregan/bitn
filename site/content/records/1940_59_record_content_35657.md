Burra Red Cross met recently to decide on how best to spend the £1,200 raised by them for equipment for the Burra Hospital.  It was proposed to pay for the X-Ray plant recently installed there, a large washing machine, an electric sterilizer, reconditioning of the pantry, 2 stainless steel sinks, a hot water service, 2 extra hand basins in the Maternity Wing and the widening of the verandah of the nurses’ sleepout.  Wherever possible the expenditure will be matched by a Government £ for £ subsidy.
