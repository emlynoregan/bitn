Mineral Resources Development Minister Tom Koutsantonis has postponed his visit to Burra for several weeks.  He had planned to meet with stakeholders and interested parties to discuss the Phoenix Copper application to explore in the Burra Mine Reserve.  The visit is now expected to be in August.  The visit is a familiarisation exercise for the minister who has taken over the portfolio from Paul Holloway, rather than a re-run of the consultation process.
