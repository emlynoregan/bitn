Burra Scouts.  Venturers are currently assisting in running the Scout Group in Rob Letcher’s absence.  This will qualify them for their Cub/Scout Instructor’s Award, which is another step on the way to their Queen’s Scout Award.  They are also undertaking rock climbing and abseiling.  They have conquered the Golf Club Quarry.  This will lead on to Cliff Rescue.
