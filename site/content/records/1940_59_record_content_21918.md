Mr P.A. McBride will stand for the LCL Plebiscite in the District of Wakefield.  If Mr McBride wins the plebiscite and then the election, LCL supporters will have a very experienced Member of Parliament, with strong connections in both Houses of Parliament.  Mr McBride had a splendid career in Parliament until he was beaten by the ALP representative for Gray in the last Federal Elections for the Senate.   He was at one time Minister for Commerce and later Minister for the Army.
