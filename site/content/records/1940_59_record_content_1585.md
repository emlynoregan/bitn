Redruth 50 Years Ago

The third in the series by ‘Unohoo’.  In this article one of Mr West’s pupils reminisces.

The schoolhouse was of stone with a weatherboard front.  It was at the back of the court House and was Government assisted.  Boys settled personal accounts with one another after school in a roofless stone building where the croquet court is now.

There were several large holes in the creek 6’ to 8’ deep where water remained for months.  At one place they had a boat.

My father built some of the mine buildings and also worked there.  Tradesmen used to get 9/- a day and miners 5/- a day with 1/- per week kept back for the doctor.  The mine, buildings, land, and all connected with it was sold when the mine closed down, for £2,000.

[Note that this is not true.]

All water for household use was carted and sold at 1/- per hogshead.  Enoch Stephens was the chief water carter.  A man named Clark also carted water from a well near where A.B. Riggs now lives.  Before the railway came there was no road from Sara’s to the station and only a few houses.  There were two or three near Sara’s corner and another batch near Austin’s shop.  There were a few where Mr Harvey lives and one or two others.  The first four hotels were The Bushman’s Club [Rest], The White Hart, Opies' (Where Bob Fuss now lives), and Broad’s opposite Austin’s butcher shop.  [The Aberdeen Hotel: Broad 1879-1880]

The first post office in Redruth was where Mr James lives, opposite the Court House Hotel.  Mrs Branch kept it.  It burnt down and was never rebuilt. (Over 70 years ago)  She then took the Court House Hotel.  [Hoad does not list a Mrs Branch at the Court House Hotel.]

There were only three hotels in Kooringa.  The present Burra Hospital was kept by Jimmy Lamb [1867-1876].  A man called Banks built the Unicorn Brewery just below the Burra School.  The present Burra Hotel was then called the Miners’ Arms.  Another, on the same side of the creek, burnt down.  It was in Lower Thames St, called the Pig & Whistle.  There was a wine store where Sara’s Kooringa shop is now.  The new Kooringa Bridge was built about 1877 or 1878 after the old one washed away in a flood.  [The new bridge opened for traffic in May 1879 after a flood on 23 March 1877 destroyed the old one.]  In this flood a circus was camped along the creek and there was a rush to get the elephants and tents away when the creek came down.

We had a farm at Mt Bryan and in the first year got 27 b per acre, but in the next year got less than half that. (Before superphosphate.)  I used to cart to Broken Hill 66 years ago, with five horses and about 1878 was the first to take a loading to Wilcannia by road – using bullocks for that.  When I was dam sinking at one time I had 91 bullocks.  I worked the NE road and at dam sinking for 32 years.
