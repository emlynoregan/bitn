Market Square.  A petition has been presented to the Burra DC calling for further work on Market Square to be postponed pending the publishing of an artist’s impression and its examination at a public meeting.  It was initiated by the Burra branch of the National Trust and attracted 570 signatures.  It was presented to the Council by President Maureen Wright at their Monday night meeting.  She pointed out that Burra had more heritage listed buildings per square kilometre than any other town in Australia and was among the six most significant heritage towns in Australia.  For these reasons the Council should seek the input of a qualified town planner with heritage experience before proceeding further.  She said that while some suggestions, like the use of late paving had been taken on board, other aspect, such as lighting, had been rushed through.  The Highways department spokesman said non-approved lighting would not attract the 50% subsidy on cost and maintenance.  Mrs Wright said that all they wanted was for the Council to investigate all possibilities.  Mr Des Menz, the Acting District Clerk, said the meeting had been valuable in bringing public opinion out in the open.  Mrs Wright would be invited to a Council executive meeting to be called soon to discuss the petition’s proposals.
