Editorial on the Land Bill 
Originally in SA land had been sold at auction to any buyer who chose to bid and most were speculators who sold again at enhanced price to the intending cultivator. The Govt. missed out on the higher price and the cultivator was crippled by the cost he had to pay. Various systems have been tried to get land opened up to the agriculturalist for as low a price as possible to encourage genuine farmers to develop the colony. Now we have over one million acres cropped annually. Many areas once thought impossible for grain are now farmed and even served by the railway. The present Bill before Parliament is aimed at opening untried pastoral land in the far north, by giving larger areas and more secure tenure to leases. We support the general principles of the Bill. 42 years seems a long term and perhaps 28 years would be more just, but at least that time is needed for the land to be truly tested. We do not support the compensation arrangements and unless resumption took place within 21 years nothing beyond the actual value of improvements should be paid, especially as 3 year’s notice to resume is required. We do not agree that those who have already held land on credit should be allowed to select again.
