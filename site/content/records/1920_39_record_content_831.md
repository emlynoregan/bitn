The width of the memorial including the steps to be 17 feet

This will take about 12 months to complete at a cost not including inscribing the names of £2,695.

The inscriptions will add about £50

Substitution of marble for granite would save about £300

Omission of the bronze lions would save about £200

The Executive strongly favours granite and the inclusion of the lions.  It is aware that the cost is about £700 over the estimate asked for, but it finds that the designs under £2,000 are not to be entertained.

The Executive believes that the sum can easily be raised.  £938 has been raised with promises of an extra £501.

The Committee was committed to pay the £10-10-0 to Mr Tillett.

At the Executive meeting on 23 February they had resolved that this design be approved by the Executive and submitted to a general meeting.

Mr Broderick thought they should go ahead with an architect to draw plans and call tenders.
