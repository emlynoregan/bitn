Kooringa Election

Latter from Samuel Stocks [Sen.] to Mr John Smith, butcher of Kooringa, 9 April 1851.

[In rather elaborate prose Mr Stocks thanks Smith for the information that his cause in the coming election has great support. He admits that his candidacy gains much from his late son’s popularity.  He also says that he will not be visiting Kooringa until he can come as the District’s representative.]

Court of Revision.  The Government has decided that because Me Lang came forward as a candidate, he has disqualified himself from sitting in a Court of Revision.  Mr Dashwood has been appointed to convene the Court of Revision in Kooringa.
