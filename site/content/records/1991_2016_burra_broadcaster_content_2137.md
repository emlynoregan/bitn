The Explorer Train will not come to Burra. It will travel only as far north as Riverton.  Ms Christina Holmdale, Public Affairs Manager for Australia National made this announcement on 6 October.

‘It is to be hoped this latest development is not part of AN’s downgrading as a prelude to closing the line.’
