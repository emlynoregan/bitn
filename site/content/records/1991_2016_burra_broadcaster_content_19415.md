Variety Club Bash

In 2000 Burra will have a team of ladies in the Bash to raise money for the disadvantaged and disabled children in SA: Angie Webster, Josie Hill of Booborowie, Pauline Thomas of Gulnare and Julie Clarke of Spalding.  They will be driving ‘Effie’, a 1957 FE model Holden.  ‘Effie’ has already competed in seven or eight Bashes.  They need to raise $7,000 prior to the event through fundraising and sponsorship.
