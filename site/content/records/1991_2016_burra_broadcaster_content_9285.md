Letter.  David Baker also writes a fairly long letter spelling out the need for a Ratepayers’ Association:

Opposing views and diverse opinion are signs of a healthy community and democracy.

Elected representatives are expected to undertake the views of the majority and act upon them.

The Ratepayers’ Association is an ideal venue for elected people to hear views of some of the ratepayers.

Tourism will always be a part of the town and tourists will be made welcome.

But there are only a few – perhaps 15-20 that rely on tourism as their main source of income – mainly in the Bed & Breakfast business.

Council does not pay rates and income tax on its businesses and has other unfair advantages in competing with other Bed & Breakfast businesses.
