Accident.  Mr J. Nelson was thrown from his dogcart about 3-4 miles east of Burra on Saturday night when one wheel passed over a load of road metal.  While he was attempting to calm the struggling and fallen horse it kicked him above the eye and inflicted a nasty wound.  Fortunately he and the horse were rescued by two passers-by and Nelson was brought into Burra for medical attention.
