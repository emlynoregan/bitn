Burra High School had its annual break-up with a concert and prize giving etc. at the Burra Institute on Thursday evening.  Dr Steele, as Chairman of the High School Council presided.  The entertainment included music, elocution, drill and dance.  Mr Haese presented his report for the year.  Enrolments had been a record 61 with an average attendance a record 53.  A woodwork centre has been established under Mr Robinson.  Clare visited in April and the girls were equal in tennis, while the boys had a first innings win in cricket.  The return visit to Clare in June saw the boys badly beaten in football, but the girls were not inferior in basketball.  In the combined High school Sports we tied with Clare in third place.  Girls from Peterborough visited in September and tied with us in basketball.  A small Grade 7 at Burra will see next yearâ€™s enrolment drop.

Dux of the school is Beryl Lawson.

Best exam results in 1928 were by Mollie Walker.
