6 November

William Jenkins, furnace mason at the Copper Company was charged by George Bevan for the company with not performing certain work he was contracted for.  George Ewbank said Jenkins had been engaged in England to work as a mason or furnace man and now refused to work the furnace.  He had refused both the witness and Leyshon Jones, the foreman of the works.  The agreement was produced.  The defendant contributed nothing material.  The Bench cleared the court and considered the matter.  After ten minutes the Bench ruled that Jenkins had to fulfil his contract.  Jenkins agreed to return to work and pay 21/- costs to the court.
