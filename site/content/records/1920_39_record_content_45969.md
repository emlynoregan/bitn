Mongolata Goldfield

George Howse one of the first to peg a claim reports he has struck colour and will sink a shaft.  He was one of the first to tackle the difficult conditions in the east side of the range where all the gold has been found – the claim is on the estate of the late James Reed.

Curlew Claim.  We understand the claim’s 255 tons produced 14oz 15dwt and 173 tons 11 dwt per ton.  [Sic: these figures make no sense and were corrected next issue.]

Pexton’s are said to be on good gold.

Pinnaroo Gold Mining Co. has a shaft at 100ft and has driven 170ft.  This is at the south end of Pexton’s.  No gold yet.  H.L. Barry (manager) & H. Parr (secretary) are both of Pinnaroo.
