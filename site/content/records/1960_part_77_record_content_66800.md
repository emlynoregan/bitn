Martin Dunstan writes a letter re his grandfather, John Dunstan and his links with the town.

He enclosed a photo of the Steam Saw Mills in Aberdeen c. 1880 in which John Dunstan was part owner.

John Dunstan was born at Gwenap in Cornwall 4 March 1851 and arrived at Port Adelaide on the Calabar before he was two years old.  With his father and mother and baby brother, he made the trip to Burra in a bullock dray in a fortnight.  After five years Captain Dunstan took over the Whealsara [sic] Copper Mines north of Bundaleer Station.  When a school was established there it was in a dugout in the side of a creek and it was there that John Dunstan learnt spelling and reading in the morning and sewing in the afternoon.  At these mines John Dunstan began picking copper ore when nine or ten years old.  After three years the family moved back to Burra, where John took night school and later attended F.R. White’s Commercial Academy.

[The above is copied from a story he gave the News in 1923.]

He went dispensing for Dr Nutt and then became clerk of the Redruth Court and later book-keeper for Dr T.H. Mayne.  In 1869 he started work with S. Drew & Co. as an accountant and corresponding clerk and stayed for seven years, also acting as clerk for the Burra District Council and auditor later of the Burra Corporation, the Mt Bryan District Council and several mines.

In 1876 he joined forces with G. & W. Sara as timber merchants, builders and contractors.  From practically nothing they built a wonderful business with activities all over the colony.  Among the notable buildings they erected were the Burra Model School, Gladstone Gaol (£21,640), Corny Point Lighthouse, Roseworthy College, the Adelaide Railway Goods Sheds and most of the railway stations on the northern and hills lines.  In a few years the firm was employing 220 men.  After W. Sara retired, the firm continued to prosper as Sara & Dunstan.  John Dunstan also worked on the Black Hills mining venture and was a part owner of the Burra Record.  [Presumably in the period before F.W. Holder gained full control.]

At 30 he was a JP and soon became a Councillor and later Mayor of Burra.  Against strong opposition he instituted tree planting.  With Cr John Lewis he acquired land for a recreation ground with a 999-year lease from the Burra Burra Mines.  He was also a member of the Burra Hospital Board, the Institute Committee and the Burra School Board of Advice.  He joined with Mr Lewis in bringing the Burra children down to Adelaide for the Adelaide Exhibition, against strong opposition.  In this he was assisted by the late W.B. Rounsevell.  The money left over was used to erect the fountain standing near the Anglican Church.

He was also President of the Burra Literary Society.  In 1891 he left Burra for Broken Hill, where he carried out similar works and became Mayor in 1899.

On 1 September 1953 the Record referred to Mr Ben Dunstan of Mt Bryan, who was a brother to John Dunstan.

[Martin Dunstan then goes on to say he is something of a fanatic on scrapbooks – in particular on Willunga and he appeals for any information relevant to that.  He also says he has his grandfather’s writing books, used at the Academy and two framed farewell messages from the town and the Literary Society, that were presented to his grandfather and he offers to lend his family relics for historic occasions in Burra.]
