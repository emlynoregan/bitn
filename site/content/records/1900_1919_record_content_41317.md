Alvina m. Escott, wife of W. Clement Escott:

The evidence adds little to the picture [except the possibly strange point that there was no light in the office when the body was discovered and she said there was no evidence the lamp had been alight as the glass was not hot.  She had carried a light from her bedroom to light the office lamp.]
