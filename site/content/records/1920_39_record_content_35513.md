A.B. Riggs writes about the Burra DC Assessment.  He says that Mr Button stated that the 1923 assessment was too high, having been made in a peak period for wool and wheat.  It was an increase of 46%.  He now says that despite the bad state of affairs currently it is reasonable to suppose things will improve and he therefore reduces the assessment by 20%.  Mr Riggs says that to be consistent the assessment should have been reduced by 35%.  The 1923 assessment might have been increased by 20% instead of 46%, i.e. it was 26% too high.  The 1930 assessment might be 26% lower than 1923 then another 20% on present prices and anticipating a gradual return to normal this would be raised 11% leaving the present assessment 35% lower than 1923.  As it stands on Mr Buttonâ€™s reasoning the 1923 increase was based on seven good years and the new assessment is based on seven normal years, but no consideration is given for the period of slump.  Also from an assessor the Council should expect more than a % assessment.  He says that ratepayers are not producing sufficient income to balance their budgets.  He admits that the 1923 budget was too high and wool is down 50% and wheat 40% and yet his assessment drops only 20%.  The fee simple value today is 50% lower than in 1923.
