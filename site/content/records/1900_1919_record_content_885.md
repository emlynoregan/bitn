PM Bro. W. Lasscock was given a farewell at the Kooringa Masonic Lodge No. 6 on Friday evening, on the eve of his departure from Burra.  About 16 brethren sat down to eat at the Commercial Hotel.  Brother Lasscock was replying to the toast when a fire alarm was raised.  [It turned out to be his own shop.]
