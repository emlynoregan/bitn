Mr Crewes said the Federal and State Governments would start the fund off with £500,000.  It would be entirely separate from the Wounded Soldiers’ Fund or any other and would be to enable returned soldiers to help themselves.  They would be advanced loans without interest to help establish themselves in a farm or business, or acquiring tools of trade etc.  He thought there should be country representatives on the Board to encourage country donations.   A major effort is planned for the 27 October.
