Burra Housing Development

The Kooringa CoHousing Co-operative plans to build 23 homes and a community centre on five acres of vacant land an Allen Street on the southern edge of Burra.  The density will be c. 4 per acre, but instead of each being on a quarter acre block, they will cluster around a central building that will provide a community kitchen, laundry, lounge and playroom, leaving the rest of the site available for orchards, windbreaks, gardens and play space.  This style of development has become popular in Scandinavia and the USA, but is the first of its kind in SA.  It is funded mainly by the SA Government.  The design includes solar heating.  Co-op members do not own the houses, but have a lifetime security of tenure.  The secretary of the Kooringa CoHousing is Colin Endean.  Tree planting has begun on the site and funding for the first seven houses has been approved by the SA Co-operative Housing Authority.
