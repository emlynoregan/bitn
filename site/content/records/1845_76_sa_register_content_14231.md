Kooringa News, 21 March

A bazaar in aid of the new Anglican Church at Redruth was opened yesterday in St Mary’s Church.  The weather had been most unpropitious and the late arrival of some of the ‘needful’ items put organisers to greater inconvenience.  There were five stalls plus a plentifully furnished supply of eatables.  The influx of visitors during the day was rather limited, but in the evening the room was considerably crowded.

The return cricket match between Burra Burra and Hamilton is expected to take place here on Easter Monday.
