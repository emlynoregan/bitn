Burra Christmas Pageant entertained with colour and variety. Father Christmas installed himself in the rotunda for an hour or so with the youngsters and the evening included a family barbecue in Market Square.

Burra Swimming Pool has been newly tiled and opened in time for Vacswim.  More than 50 young swimmers have participated in rather cold conditions.

Adchem has had to cut back on production following the fire at Moomba Gas field that reduced the availability of gas to SA.  Supplies were minimal for three days and slightly restricted for a further week.  In all about 100 tons of production was lost as a result, but they hope to be able to make that up later.

Andrew Glen of the Visitor Centre reports that Burra Tourism has had a good year, with good attendance at events throughout the year and a very healthy flow of visitors.  Dove and Brewery Cottages have been added to the available accommodation and Burra Trail Rides are now set to resume.
