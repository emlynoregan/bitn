Advt. Casey Cooper & partner Melissa (Mel) Miller have taken over McPhee’s butcher shop in Burra.  Casey began his apprenticeship with McPhhee’s in 2001.  After completing his apprenticeship and working at the shop for more than five years he and Mel went to Canada where his love and expert ability in handling horses saw him spend time on a working cattle ranch outside Calgary.  Missing the warmer weather and with Mel pregnant with their son, Cash, the couple returned to Burra.  Casey became an accredited crane driver and was working for Clare Crane Hire when he heard that Gary McPhee had sold his Clare store.  He approached Gary about the possibility of buying the Burra store.  The couple are determined to maintain the long tradition of a high quality meat store that has been an institution in the mid-north for more than 22 years.  As well as acquiring the business Casey has taken on the training of third year apprentice Cameron Daniels and first year apprentice Rory Muir.  Gary & his wife Joanne have eased the new owners into the job over the last few months and the official transfer took place from 12 January.  Joanne & Gary McPhee are now looking forward to ‘a good long break’.  [Photo of Mel & Casey.]
