The Burra Branch of Friends of the Heysen Trail is approaching its 20th anniversary.  The group maintains the section between Logans Gap and Spalding and fosters walking in the area.  The first working bee cleared grass at Mt Bryan East School, an overnight stop for walkers.  Early members helped mark the trail between Mt Bryan and Hallett and later on in the Browne Range.  Later work has included designing and building shelters with rainwater tanks, tree planting and overnight trips as well as day and moonlight walks.
