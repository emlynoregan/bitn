Blood Transfusion Service.  It has recently been discovered why some babies are born dead or die soon after from Haemolytic Disease.  In such cases the blood of the mother has been responsible for the destruction of the infant’s blood cells.  It has also been found that a transfusion of blood with particular requirements in respect of the Rh factor can save the infant’s life in many cases.  It is therefore desirable that as many people as possible in Burra be identified as possible donors when such a need arises.  Representatives of the SA Blood Transfusion Service will visit Burra in 15 April at 10 a.m. and all are urged to come along to be tested for their suitability in respect of the Rh factor.
