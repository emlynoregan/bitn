Robertstown Railway

A meeting at the Robertstown Hotel on 16 October has urged the Government to construct a railway from Eudunda to Robertstown.  The north end of settlement is about 20 miles from a railway and thousands of acres of good wood are being burned for lack of a railway to send it to a market.  Phosphate mines in the area could also be worked as well as the obvious benefits to farmers.  There will be a deputation to the Government on 30 October.
