Tennis.

Kooringa 17-117 defeated Hallett 3-68

Aberdeen 17-112 defeated Willalo 3-57

Leighton 13-100 defeated Mt Bryan 7-79

[Leighton’s appearance twice seems odd, but the players appear to be Leighton’s in both.]

Booborowie 14-99 defeated Spalding 6-70

Hallett 19 defeated Kooringa 2

[Sic: though a total of 21 sets is at odds with other results.]
