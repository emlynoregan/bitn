Copperhouse School recently had an Arbor Day at which there was a large attendance of parents and friends.  Mr W.H. Lloyd gave an address on tree planting.  The school has recently been remodelled by the education department who purchased the property from the Redruth Methodist Trust.  During the week a new flagpole was presented by W.H. Lloyd.  The head teacher is Miss Nosworthy.

[The building was originally the Copperhouse Primitive Methodist Church.]
