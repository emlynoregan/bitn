Burra Burra Show Inc.  The AGM was held in Pearce’s Building 9 March.

Burra Rural Youth thanked the society for the use of the pavilion for its meetings.

Elected: Patron, Sir Philip McBride; Vice-President, I.E. Gare.

The 1954 show will be held on 9 October.

Mr W.H. Lloyd spoke of the work done by Mr L.R. Fuss in putting tables around the flower pavilion, valued at £45.  Mr Fuss carried out this work free of charge.

A minute of appreciation for the work of the late E.C. Collins was recorded.

W.H. Lloyd read the President’s Report for the year.

The show on 10 October was very successful.  It was opened by the society’s Patron, Sir Philip McBride, Minister for Defence.  This year 128 cages for pigeons were constructed at a cost of £92-10-0.  The shed previously used to house dogs was moved and used to house bantams.  The Flower Pavilion was improved to take permanent tables erected on each side.  Mr Fuss volunteered to do the work if the materials were provided.

Further seating was provided on the north end of the ring and more trees donated by Mr R. Humphrys were planted.  Entries were very gratifying.  There was a pleasing interest in sheep and wool and there was good support from Industrial Exhibits.

The society notes with regret the passing of supporters E.C. Collins, E. Jettner and E. Murray.

During the year Mr Fabian resigned as Secretary, but was replaced by Mr H.L. Foote, who put in an untiring effort.

[A list of individuals is then thanked for their help.]

The Badminton Club took charge of the Show Dance and realised £17.

The profit for the year of £256 reduces the overdraft to about £102, which is a splendid result.
