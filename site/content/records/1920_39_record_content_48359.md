The Mayor in reply referred to the many laudatory comments on his work in the paper and to the expenses he incurred in entertaining visiting officials and to the long and honourable connection of the family with the town.  He made reference to his late brother Robert who was the first Burra boy on active service in France in 1914 and the first Burra boy to give his life for his country*, and to his grandfather who had brought the big engine to Burra.  The money from The News had been split equally between the needy men of Burra and Mongolata.  He objected to borrowing money given the present high rates of interest.  He produced various items of correspondence from the Minister of Industry and others, but the point being made was not really clear.  He said Cr March had said some old resident might like to make a reunion of the erection of ‘Johnny Green’ and invite P.A. McBride to perform the ceremony, but Councillors had voted against acknowledging that gentleman’s generosity.  He took up the RSL’s role again, but was cut off by the chair as it had been covered.
