Typically dominated by larger advertisements with perhaps 2 to 4 columns devoted to sports and some news.  Of the latter District Council reports comprised a large, but rather unedifying part.  Some non-local pieces were common, including a regular column on ‘Last Week in State Parliament’ by the local MP John Freebairn.
