Advt.  Jennison’s Tyre Service

Mr H.J.B. Jennison advises that as he has enlisted in the RAAF his business in Commercial Street will be carried on by Mr A.D. Sellars.  He will trade as ‘Jennison’s Tyre Service Station’.  He has taken over the stock and plant and all agencies.

[The temporary nature of the arrangement is suggested in the accompanying news paragraph on the same page which says: ‘Mr Jennison arranged with Mr Sellars to carry on the good work during his absence.]
