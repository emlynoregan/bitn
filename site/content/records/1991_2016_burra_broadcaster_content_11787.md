Police in Burra – The 150 year Celebration

The twenty-four-piece Police Band entertained locals to mark the occasion.

220 people attended the concert at Redruth Gaol on Tuesday night, with supper served in the interval.

The $500 profit from the night will aid local community groups.

Earlier that afternoon the Commissioner of Police, David Hunt unveiled a plaque at the old Police Lock-up at Burra North.  [4 photos.]
