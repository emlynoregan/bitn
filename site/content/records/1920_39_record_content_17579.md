Soldiers’ Aid Society Strawberry Fete in aid of the Royal Institution for the Blind was held in the Institute on Friday.  As expected the move from Jubilee Hall boosted attendance.  A little over £100 was raised.  In opening the fete Mrs Warnes expressed regret that the Society was contemplating going into liquidation.
