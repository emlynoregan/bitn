Editorial on the Wonderful Reports of Gold Finds in WA.

It is wonderful how depressions so often lead to mineral discoveries: Burra, Moonta, and Broken Hill.  Such discoveries must give a wonderful impetus to WA which has languished for so long.  But it is found in a very inhospitable country and for every one person who makes a great find probably one hundred will suffer terrible loss.  While we will not benefit directly as we did in the case of Broken Hill, yet we may see a growing market for hay, chaff, preserved meat and other products as well as an opportunity for surplus employment.
