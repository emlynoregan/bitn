Obituary.  The death of Mrs Alfred Walker was announced yesterday to the surprise of her friends, for although she had been in indifferent health the seriousness of it had been unknown to her many friends.  Mrs Walker was a keen Red Cross member and active in patriotic work.  She leaves a husband and three daughters: Corris, Mrs Glan Tiver; Betty, Mrs J.F. Fletcher of Adelaide and Miss Molly Walker and one surviving son, Robert Walker of Adelaide.  There are three grandchildren.  [Mary Lynda (Molly) Day was the adopted daughter of Luke and Hester (Esther) Day; born about 1887 and died 4 May 1942, Burra.]
