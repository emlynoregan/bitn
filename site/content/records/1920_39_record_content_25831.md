The Seaside Trip to Glenelg took place last Saturday.  The departure at 5.30 a.m. ensured a cool trip.  The idiot who rang the Methodist Church Bell was not appreciated by those trying to get a little sleep before the early departure.  The first train left on time and arrived punctually at 9.30 a.m.  The second was half an hour later.  The day began clouded, hot and sultry, but cooler at the coast.  The afternoon was cooler and ideal for the beach with an absence of wind and sun.  Those who wished to go to Adelaide transhipped immediately and were in the city by 10 a.m.  Unlike the coast the city remained hot and humid.  Many visited the Zoo and Art Gallery.

In the city there was a march of the unemployed to underscore the bad financial state of SA and in Victoria Square a lunch of bread and jam had been served to the hungry congregated there – conditions which to country visitors seemed appalling.  Old Burraites now in the city joined the throng at the beach.  The seaside amusement park was much enjoyed with its rides and sideshows.

The Mayor of Glenelg arranged to entertain twenty-four guests at 4 o’clock, but only Mr Will Lee the Honorary Secretary was present, as of the committee only he had made the trip.  One accident spoilt the day.  Mrs E. Hobby of Kooringa cut her head on the piles of the jetty and required four stitches.  The first train left at 7.30 p.m. as scheduled, but many waited for the 8 p.m. train, which was therefore overcrowded.  The trains reached Burra at 12.30 a.m. & 1.00 a.m.
