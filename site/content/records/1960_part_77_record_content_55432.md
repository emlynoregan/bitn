An account of the first service came to light, preserved in a report in the SA Register.  It was actually opened in October – knowledge of this only came to light after the date had been fixed for the centenary.  The entry in the SA Register 10 October 1871 says:

At Iron Mine Gum Creek the opening sermons of the new Primitive Methodist Chapel were preached on Sunday 1 October 1871 by Rev. H.J. Pope, minister of the circuit, to large congregations.

On Monday the tea was well patronised by friends from all parts of the district.  Mr T. Hutchens presided and Mr T. Clapp gave an address on forming character and the perpetual freshness of Bible Truth and the necessity of Bible education.  Mr T. Pedler closed his speech with recitation on Christ’s commission.  Mr J. Barrows referred to the absurdity of remarks by grumblers who were perpetually regretting the lack of pulpit talent, power and faithfulness.  The Redruth Primitive Methodist Choir sang well chosen anthems.  The new chapel was built by Messrs J. & T. Pearce of Kooringa for a total cost of c. £140 and proceeds from the service were £40.

[A list of people apologising for being unable to attend the centenary follows and thanks are expressed for all those who made the occasion such a success.]
