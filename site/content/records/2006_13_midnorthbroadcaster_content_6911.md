Steven Reeves of Eudunda writes criticising the Ratepayers Action Group (RAG).  He sees the usefulness of the properly instituted Community Management Committees, but says the RAG, while complaining of the lack of accountability and transparency by the Council, is itself lacking in transparency.  It seems to have no terms of reference, no minutes, constitution or aims that are readily discoverable.  Surely the group should have the necessary incorporation credentials and indemnity insurance.
