Burra Town Council Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting was held in the Council Chamber on Monday 30 June.  Only eight of the 500 ratepayers attended.

Perhaps this means that everyone is very satisfied, but it is disappointing for the members of Council.  The Mayor reported on the work done by Council, which this year had concentrated on road work within the town.  There were, he said 62 tree types within the town and more trees than in any other SA country town.  Mr Pederick, as headmaster of the Burra High School had done much to promote tree planting and to interest scholars in it.  Unfortunately the cemetery was in a bad state and the Children’s Playground had been neglected.  The Council was doing what it could at the cemetery, but it was not enough to maintain it in a satisfactory condition.  The Playground would be attended to as part of the Caravan Park project.  Jubilee week last year had shown a profit of £161, of which £80-10-0 went to the Burra Hospital and the same amount to the Burra & District War Memorial.  The Burra Town Hall Pictures had been running as a community project for 18 months and were going along satisfactorily.  Two repayments of the initial loan had been made.  A.A. Davey was congratulated for running an efficient library, as good as in any country town.  H.J.B. Jennison thought Burra North had not been getting its due proportion of road works and asked that that be rectified in the coming year.  The Mayor outlined his duties throughout the year in entertaining visitors and visiting the school and various other places.  He thanked the Councillors and the Town Clerk, Mr E.R. Davey for their support.  Mr M.T. Fuller moved a vote of thanks, which was seconded by H.J.B. Jennison.
