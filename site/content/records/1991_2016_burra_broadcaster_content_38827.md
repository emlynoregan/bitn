BCS.  Safety in the school carpark has been improved with a new fence separating the busy school carpark from the school bus access road, with two designated crossing areas.  The school received a $5,000 RAA Regional Safety Grant to fund the fence. The project included new lines painted, new zebra crossings and the removal of an old shelter shed.  Thanks are given to volunteer parents Des Nicholls and Paul Williams, who helped Chris Taylor build the fence.
