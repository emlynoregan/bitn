Blood Transfusion Service.  A team was in Burra on Sunday to search for the Rh factor in the Universal type of blood donor (Group Four O) among volunteers from Burra and District.  Only 30 people came forward, which was disappointing, because the blood type being sought is rare.  The test only involves a pin prick to obtain a few drops of blood and is practically painless.
