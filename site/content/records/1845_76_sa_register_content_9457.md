The Burra Burra Mine [Editorial]

The prosperity and stability of the SA economy owes a great deal to the extent, richness and permanency of her copper mines.  The great potential for grain production requires a market and in the future it is likely that export markets for this will be closed.  The development of the economy in SA will provide an internal market.

The shareholders of the Burra Burra Mine held their half-yearly meeting yesterday and the company’s affairs were found to be in a most satisfactory and flourishing condition.  When the great exodus of miners to the gold-fields took place, the Directors of the Burra Burra Mine suspended work and allowed the mine to flood with water.  Since the resumption of operations and the erection of the large engine, this has all been got out, but it was not until last May that production began again from the lowest levels.  Here success has been much greater than was anticipated at the last half-yearly meeting.  In the 50 fathom level at Peacock’s Shaft, the lode, it seems, is fifteen feet wide and is turning out malachite and red oxide of copper in good quality, whilst the lodes in the other workings are looking well.  The ore on hand on 31 March last was 3,251 tons and since then 4,409 tons have been raised, making 7,760 tons.  Of this 3,094 tons have been delivered to the English & Australian Copper Co., whilst 4,566 tons remain on hand at the Mine.  The mean average of the 4,409 tons produced in the last six months is 24% and for the last two ‘takes’ is 27%.  Since the last half-yearly meeting the smelted copper exported has been 214½ tons, while there are 161 tons on hand.  The balance of profit, on the realization of copper and ore, as shown in the accounts, is £61,510.

This is enough to pay five quarterly dividends of 100% each.  Directors therefore have decided to resume dividend payments on 1 December next.  There is no reason to doubt that large quantities of ore will continue to be raised.  The Directors say they are still in great want of labour.

Another mining property of the Burra proprietary is the Karkulto Mine, a few miles to the south of Kooringa.  This is likely to become highly productive, as an important lode of ore has been found there in recent days.  It is the intention of Directors to test this thoroughly, as soon as miners become redundant at the Burra.
