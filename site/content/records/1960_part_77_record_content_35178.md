CWA Burra Branch AGM is reported from 16 June.  Thirty members attended.  President Mrs E.T. Baulderstone reported on a successful year. [Secretary Jennifer Fordâ€™s report is printed in just under 1 column of detail.]

Average attendance was 25.

Highlight of the year was the birthday party with the State President Mrs Zerbe as guest speaker.

The Warnes Group Conference was held at Burra this year in April with members from 16 branches present.  The CWA did not cater this year for the Burra Races and fund raising efforts were a street stall, an apron afternoon, an oil heating demonstration and the monthly trading table.

During the year a plaque was put on the Mrs A.L. Kellock memorial gate.  (She was a foundation member.)

The appearance of the rest room has been enhanced by the gravel surrounds (given and spread by R.W. Humphrys) and the gay kitchen curtains made and hung by Mrs S. Scroop.  Mrs A.B. Riggs has maintained the UK links.  Mrs A. Phillips aided by Mrs Gallagher has continued the weekly hospital visits.

Elected were: President, Mrs E.T. Baulderstone; Vice-Presidents, Mrs H. Jennison and one yet to be elected; Secretary, Mrs R. Jeffery and Treasurer, Mrs H. Crump.
