Burra Town Council, 20 September

The Imperial War Graves Commission advised that bronze plaques will be erected on the graves of deceased servicemen and it requests any fees be waived.

L. Day is to be requested to cut boxthorns back to fence level.

Cr Nankivell moved that the old cart near Holder Garden in Chapel St be removed.  Carried.

R. Fuss writes again on the loss of trees in the town.  He says there are a number of trees not on the editor’s list and he believes that (without having made a detailed count) the total would be closer to 60 – enough for a nice plantation.  Formerly Mayors and Councillors looked on trees as almost sacred and resisted their removal.  Requests for their destruction were seldom granted.  No doubt there are rare occasions when removal is justified, ‘but those destroyed recently certainly did not harm property, did not restrict trade, were a beautiful shade in summer and did not obscure a street light.  This road is straight, the light shines down the centre and the trees were on one side, growing in the footpath, so why remove them?  I trust that my feeble protest will have at least a little influence on future actions.’
