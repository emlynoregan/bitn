Burra Town Council, 2 September

[A request for K.M. Drew to provide proper gates on the stock road leading to O’Leary’s old slaughterhouse reveals that that gentleman had recently leased the same.]

T.W. Wilkinson & Co. expressed their willingness to have cement kerbing replace the timber kerbing in front of their premises, under the usual conditions.

Mr S. Irlam’s tender for lopping the trees from R.C. Lott’s corner to Victoria Park was accepted.  He will carry out the work in return for the timber.

The acacia tree in front of Holder Gardens will be grubbed out.
