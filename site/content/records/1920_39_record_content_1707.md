Obituary.  Mr George Sampson died on 6 July.  He had been to a Council meeting on 5 July as the representative for East Ward and afterwards had gone to Mingary with his son Alan by the Broken Hill express.  There he had a large tank-sinking plant.  Whilst riding a horse the saddle slipped and the horse bolted.  Mr Sampson was obliged to let go and slid along the ground in a sitting position until a foot struck a post, which threw his head forward with great force against the post.  He died instantly.  Sons George and Alan witnessed the accident.  Clem was in charge of another plant at Thompson’s Siding out from Broken Hill.  Mr Sampson was born in Bridge Street in 1867, the third son of the late Mr & Mrs William Sampson, who left for WA some time ago.  He married Miss Leaver of Hampton in 1890.  She and five children survive: Messrs Clement W., George & Alan and Misses Edith & Silby.  He was generous and broadminded and a keen sportsman.  He had recently put down an asphalt court for the Kooringa Tennis Club at his own expense.  He was a popular employer.

[Born in Kooringa 21 December 1866.]
