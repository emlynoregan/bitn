Goyder Council

Work is soon to begin on lining the effluent ponds.  Council is still sourcing the 2,000 tonnes of clean sand to sit on the liners to give a coverage of about 10 cm.

It seems the Government Department concerned has decided not to remove the Burra Railway Bridge because of the cost, but to effect some minor maintenance work on cracks and the damaged parapet.

Council is considering a series of dams at Eudunda to slow run-off and reduce the potential for flooding.
