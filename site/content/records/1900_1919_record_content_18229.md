Albert March, aged 11, had a lucky escape from death when a length of railway line suspended from the rafters in their horse shed, fell at one end and pinned him to the ground by the head.  He suffered a broken nose and was at times delirious.  Had the other end of the rail fallen he would have been crushed to a pulp.
