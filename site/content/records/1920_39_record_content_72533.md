Mrs M.A. Hunt of the Bon Accord Hotel writes an indignant letter in response to the comments about the disturbance when the Exeter Football Team visited.  She considers the Exeter’s Captain was fortunate to have another team in town to blame.  Mrs Hunt then appears to be referring to the other group when she goes on to say that apart from one young fellow who was arrested for bad language and was drunk when he arrived the rest of the team was well behaved.  This can’t be a reference to the Exeter Team because she then says the police told her that two of the Exeter men were put in the lock-up.  The other team [previously unnamed anywhere] were the Rosatta Team [perhaps Rosetta?] who Mrs Hunt said used no bad language and mostly behaved like gentlemen even though they were very crowded in her hotel because she had arranged to take 12, but ended up taking the other 10 or 12 when another publican let them down.  They accidentally broke a jug and basin due to the crowding (since replaced).  She says the remarks in the paper reflect badly on the type of house she runs and the class of people admitted.  The Rosattas were not the rough team that some are trying to make out.
