Drew & Crewes’s chaff and wood mills at Aberdeen have been in operation for four years and they now find it necessary to make additions to their premises.  A 6 h.p. Crossley oil engine is used to crush oats, maize, wheat, barley, linseed and peas.  Additions will allow the cutting of wood and chaff and the bagging of the latter in one operation.  The firm’s business extends as far as the NT.
