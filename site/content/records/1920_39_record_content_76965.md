St Mary’s Diamond Jubilee.  The first Anglican service in Burra was held 92 years ago by Rev. J.C. Bagshaw, probably at the school.  [Which school is not stated.]  The first St Mary’s was built a few years later where Mr & Mrs N. Hann’s house now stands.  On 3 July 1879 the foundation stone of the present church was laid.  The building was opened for use in January 1880 and consecrated 25 March 1892.  It has since seen the addition of many stained glass windows and a pipe organ.  Diamond Jubilee services were held in the week beginning 1 November by Rev. Christopher Gray.  The service on Sunday was a Parish Festival and was broadcast over wireless stations 5CL & 5CK; the first church service to be broadcast from Burra.  There was a flower service in the afternoon.  Rev. Donald Redding preached at Evensong.  Congregations were large.
