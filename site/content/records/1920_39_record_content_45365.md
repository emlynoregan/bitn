Burra Burra Show Inc. AGM 6 March with President I.J. Warnes in the chair.

Elections: same officers returned unopposed.

In the past year the deaths of T. Sandland a past President, James Reed and W.J. McBride deprived the society of three staunch supporters.

The dog trials were held on 1 & 2 April, but the flower and poultry shows held at the same time were not a success.  Though the dog trials are not a financial success we will continue with an aim at minimal loss.

Membership numbers have risen.

The show on 26 October was held in doubtful weather, but the gate was better than last year.  Sheep could have been better represented.  Cattle numbers were up.  Wool was a fine exhibition.

The budget was balanced.  The year’s transactions showed a profit of £33.  The society paid off a debenture of £5 to the President and one of £10 to the estate of T.H. Sandland.

Elected: Patron, C. Bartholomaeus; President, I.J. Warnes; Vice-Presidents, S.H. Robinson & A.B. Riggs and Secretary, Mr Edwards.
