New Railway Bridge.

Last Sunday the old wooden railway bridge over the Burra Creek was replaced by a steel structure.  Work to remove the old bridge began after the passing of the Broken Hill Express in Saturday night and work continued through Sunday night to get the new bridge safely in place in time for the Broken Hill Express Monday morning.
