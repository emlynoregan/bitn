Aberdeen Croquet.  The proposed grounds at Aberdeen were busy on Saturday when a large pepper tree was removed and soon the busy bee engaged Mr T. Woollacott’s team, Sara & Co.’s lorry and Alan Kakoschke’s lorry too.  Mr H.W. Tiver will cultivate the land, Mr Wardle will help erect a shed and Mr Steer will do the painting.  [There was no indication here which of the three sites was decided upon, though it was the one near the old White Hart Hotel.]
