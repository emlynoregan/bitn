A.L. Bence writes complaining of certain statements made by the Mayor Mr T.H. Woollacott concerning clothing for the unemployed.  A suggestion had been made that instead of sending to Adelaide for clothing, coupons could be issue to local traders.  The Mayor said he has sent for £16 worth and the Government was buying up to £20,000 worth at a time and could thus buy more cheaply than local merchants.

Mr Bence challenges this, saying that neither he nor other storekeepers had been approached or their prices asked for.  He challenges the Mayor to supply any article which he and other storekeepers could not supply at the same or better prices.  In any case the principle is wrong.  Patronage of local business is the first step to prosperity.  It is the Mayor’s duty to take the first step to see that business is kept in the town.*

Another thing is that the system of distribution is unbusinesslike and unfavourable to recipients.  Any woman would prefer to pick out her own articles rather than depend on goods sent up to her order that in some cases prove to be unsuitable or poorly fitting and subject to delays of sometimes seven to eight weeks.  Cr Kellaway’s suggestion about coupons is the right and only solution.

The money is earned in the town and the earners should have the option of picking their own clothing.
