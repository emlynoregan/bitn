Aberdeen Tennis Club held its AGM on Friday 6 September and elected President, Robert Reed; Vice-Presidents, M. Nicholls & M. Tiver; Secretary & Treasurer, F. & S. Scroop; Patron, F.H. Reed.  For the coming season it was decided to have two ‘A’ Grade teams, one ‘B’ Grade and one Junior Team.  R. Reed reported on the past year.  One ‘A’ Grade team (Blue) reached the grand finals and lost to Mt Bryan.  In the season the old grandstand behind the numbers 1 & 2 courts was dismantled and new piping stands erected.  No. 2 court had to be resheeted for which money was successfully raised.  The Easter Tournament was a success, though wet weather and bad light meant three events had to be completed later.
