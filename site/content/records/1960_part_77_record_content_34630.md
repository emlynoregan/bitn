Redruth Ladies’ Guild.  The Secretary Mrs H. Jennison reports on the past year in about ¾ column.  Membership was 42 with an average attendance of 27.

[It is interesting to see that they catered for the Roman Catholic Loyalty Dinner in early December, which is an indication of changing denominational relationships.]
