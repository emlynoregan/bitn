Burra Defence Rifle Club.  Matches are reported.  R. Fairchild won the vernier that was given as the prize, though it is thought he rather tricked the handicapper by having a practice target at Leighton unknown to the handicapper.

Firing on Monday saw I.A. Macindoe 97 and J. Clarke 93, in the lead for Capt. Lordâ€™s medal and J. Clarke 103 and W. Lomman 100, leading for the Caroona Cup.
