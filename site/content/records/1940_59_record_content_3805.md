Mongolata Gold Field.

Byles Mongolata Mine (Golden Harp Lease)

I.J. Warnes reports on the last 18 months.  For the first 12 months of this period no gold was obtained, as the mine was being put in order.  Mr Schwier is managing it and 3 men are employed.  The results of crushings for the last six months:

Tons	Cwt	Yielded	Oz	Dwt	Gr

24 June	5	14		17	19	7

18 July	5	9		13	17	7

31 July	6	15		19	16	3

16 August	6	3		14	8	4

10 September	6	17		13	5	5

10 October	5	17		9	19	0

5 November	6	8		17	0	6

Total	43	3		106	5	8

The balance sheet to 31 July shows a loss, but had the proceeds for one crushing made before than come through, the amount would have been reduced to about a Â£35 loss, which is the best result for some time.  From May on the crushings have more than paid for expenses and it is anticipated the present six months will show a profit and the financial position will gradually improve.  Work has been confined to the Golden Harp Lease.  Last week a 17 oz 6 gr nugget was found.
