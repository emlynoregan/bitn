Burra Town Council, 6 April

Permission was granted for T.H. Woollacott to build a fine house for M.A. Radford at Aberdeen.  [Redruth perhaps?]

The Inspector of Public works has had a look at the townâ€™s roads.  The Mayor reported there was no chance of a special rate.

Cr Hammond had previously voiced his objection to there being a quarry on the school hill and having been outvoted he now wished to ensure that blasting not occur within half an hour of school times.

Cr Kellaway said blasting could be arranged between 7.30 and 8.30, and a few trees would hide the quarry and there was no such good metal anywhere else handy.

The Overseer said there was no complaint about blasting at the hospital quarry with sick people quite near.  It was resolved that blasting be not allowed between 8.30 a.m. and 5 p.m. except in school holidays.

[This discussion about the school quarry obviously means the quarry had been proceeded with although the Council, as reported in the Record of 11 March had resolved it not proceed.  Presumably the report there is incorrect and it was the amendment and not the motion that was carried.
