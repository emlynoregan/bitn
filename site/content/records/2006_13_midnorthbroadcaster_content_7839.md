Launch of a Photographic History of Burra

After eight years of research the Burra History Group is ready to release their book entitled Burra: A Photographic Journey.  It will officially be launched by Professor David Walker of Deakin University at the Burra Town Hall on 8 June.  Professor Walker says the fascinating history of Burra is beautifully told in the text and photographs assembled by Eric Fuss and Meredith Satchell.  While the book does the old town proud their history tells a larger story of settlement, adaptation to hard climate and historical change.  Prof. Walker described it as a visual treat and a pleasure to read.    Meredith Satchell, President of the Burra History Group, said that Ian Auhlâ€™s popular Burra & District, a Pictorial Memoir, first published 34 years ago, is now out of print and this is the first book of the type to be printed since then.  If it were not for the generosity of the District Council of Goyder, the Burra Visitor Centre, The Burra branch of the National Trust, the Burra Community Library and two individual donors the History Group would not have been able to fund the first print run of 200.  The 246 page book with 64 in colour is in A$ format and sells for $50 [sic: error for $55.]
