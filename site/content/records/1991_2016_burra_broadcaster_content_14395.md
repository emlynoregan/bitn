Weather.

A pine tree fell on Maureen Bevan’s car in the car park at St Mary’s Church on Friday.  An SES team freed the vehicle without damage.  [Photo.]

Storms on Thursday and Friday had a devastating effect on newly shorn sheep, killing thousands across the district.

Roger Dunn of Koo-Owie lost more than 1,000 recently moved in from Koomooloo, where drought conditions had already weakened them.  Bruce and Celine Stockman lost more than 600 in Friday’s chill and many others report losses up to 100.

Stations report full dams and late cropping areas will benefit from the rain, but in areas where hay had been cut, ready for baling, many will have it lost or downgraded and unfit for export.

The local SES crew were kept busy assisting farmers recovering and burying dead sheep and with wind damage.  They also secured flapping ridge-capping on the Uniting Church roof.
