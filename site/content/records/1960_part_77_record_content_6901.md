It was pointed out that a pedestrian crossing would compel motorists to stop if any pedestrian was using the crossing, whereas flashing lights would merely warn motorists of the possibility of children crossing and slow them down to 15 m.p.h., but as the school was half a mile away motorists could not be compelled to observe the 15 m.p.h. speed limit.  It could be enforced past the playground, but that would not help much.  A pedestrian crossing could be set up by the Council with the permission of the Commissioner of Highways and it needed a prohibition of parking for 30 ft either side.

After discussion the Council decided to apply for a pedestrian crossing.
