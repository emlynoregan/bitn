Sgt Edington had been called to the defendant’s mother’s house (Mrs O’Brien) and found the defendant on the sofa in a semi-hysterical condition, with a bruise on her temple.  Her version of the altercation said she was coming up the hill on her horse when Kakoschke hit her horse on the nose with a stick and had thrown a brick at her.  Dr Steele had been called.  Edington searched, but could find no sign of a brick that would fit the story.

[Considerably more detail of the events is printed.]

Mrs O’Brien said her daughter had been beaten with a whip and left unconscious on the road, but the only mark on her appeared to be the bruise allegedly from the brick.  Edington then detailed the marks on Mrs Kakoschke and a ripped sleeve.  The case was adjourned after the prosecution case.
