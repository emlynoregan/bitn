Burra History Group launched its book The Works of Frank Treloar, Burra’s First Historian at the Town Hall last Wednesday.  The 208 page book collects his original 50 page booklet and his other works in a 208 page publication.  It has been complied and edited by Meredith Satchell and Eric Fuss.  Meredith welcomed guests.  Eric Fuss discussed the evolution of the book and offered snippets of what it contained in an introduction before asking Frank Treloar’s grandson, Frank Treloar Hartwig to unveil the pile of books.  Refreshments followed.
