Characteristics of the paper in 1896

Characteristics essentially unchanged from 1893.

Page 1

Large advertisements, some not local.

Page 2

Smaller advertisements.  Local businesses along with sales and public notices.

News sometimes gets a start, but often only a little and it is frequently pushed onto page three before it gets a start.

Page 3

Largely local news and reports from correspondents from surrounding districts.  Occasional pieces from further afield and a few items of humour.  The ‘Sparks’ column continues to be somewhat enigmatic at times.

Page 4

Larger advertisements, mostly not local.

Numbering of issues in 1896.

Numbering of issues in this year was chaotic.  Volume XV continued from its start on 7 December 1892 and ran for the whole of 1896.

Numbers began with 328 (3) on 2 January, the number having been used twice in 1895, and ran to 331 on 27 May.

In this sequence the number in round brackets indicates the number of times it was used in Volume XV to the 27 May 1896 and the number in square brackets indicates the times used in an earlier sequence and the year in which this occurred.

328 (3) [2, 1895]

328 (4)

329 (11)

330 (7)

331 (2)
