The guarantee of the promoters of the Burra Grammar School has now expired.  Three years ago thirty persons guaranteed 12 guineas a year to start the school under Rev. L.W. Stanton MA, who was brought from England to superintend it.  The scheme has been a failure, though Mr Stanton’s services have been secured for a further six months on a smaller guarantee.  It is unfortunate that a superior school under a thoroughly efficient teacher should go down for want of support.
