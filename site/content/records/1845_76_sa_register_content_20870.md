Kooringa News, 26 June

A man calling himself William Cummings came to Burra last week and began placing very large orders for a station that he said lay 180 miles beyond the Barrier Ranges.  The orders were consistent with those needed to establish a large new head station, but no money changed hands.  He then vanished, leaving storekeepers with made up orders ready for collection, but as no goods had been taken he had committed no crime by his lark.

The Primitive Methodists at Redruth celebrated their Sunday-school Anniversary on 23 & 24 June.  It was a great success.  Rev. Jarrett preached.  Collections were larger than at the previous Anniversary.

Midwinter was a Mine holiday and was duly celebrated by the firing of cannons, burning of tat-barrels and the making of bonfires.

The working men are complaining bitterly about the low wages for making the new road to Adelaide.  They say that 15/- a week is as much as can be earned.  Many are still out of work and many workless men are arriving from the bush.  Applications for rations will soon be made to the Government to avert starvation.

Hopes are still held that a company will be formed to work Princess Royal Mine.  If a little capital were raised 200 men could be employed.  About 40 tons of ore, said to average 20%, are at grass and the fourteen men there now are expected to raise 60 tons this take.
