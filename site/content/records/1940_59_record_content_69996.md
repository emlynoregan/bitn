Burra Bowling Club.  President H. Jennison reported a successful season, even though Burra teams were unsuccessful in inter-team competition, with Clare taking the top three places.  This year Burraâ€™s secretary Mr J. Topsfield was President of the Mid North Bowling Association and the Mid North Championship Rinks were played on our greens on 2 April, with Auburn coming out victors. The Burra Club Tournaments were very well run.  Trophies:

Club Champion 	R. Harris

Consistency	D. Jacka

Championship Pairs	L. Hood & Williams

Handicap Singles	H. Pearce

Electric Light Pairs	Hood & Phillips

During the year visits were made by Hallett, Robertstown, Peterborough and Blyth and we visited Hallett and Robertstown and individuals visited Riverton, Blyth, Renmark, Marrabel, Jamestown and Cummins.  Thank go to Greens keeper Mr A. Bown, who unfortunately cannot continue next season.  The committee hopes to purchase the present property from the debenture holders and this matter is presently with our solicitor, Mr Bednall.  This will require incorporation, which is also in hand.  Social games have been less successful and I hope some constructive suggestions about this might come forward.  Elected: President, H.J.B. Jennison; Vice-Presidents, H. Binks-Williams & G.H. Dollman and Secretary, J.B. Topsfield.
