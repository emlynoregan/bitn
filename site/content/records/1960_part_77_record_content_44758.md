M & BHA.  Despite 39 babies attending the clinic in January and February and 30 in March, only five members attended the Association meeting in March and none of those had babies attending at present.  Money has to be raised to maintain the building, which has recently been painted at a cost of $100 and each year $100 has to be sent to Headquarters as part of the Sisterâ€™s wages.  Within the next two years $250 has to be raised as part of the cost of a small transportable house at Clare for a resident Sister for the district.  The attendance of mothers and their help is thus vital.
