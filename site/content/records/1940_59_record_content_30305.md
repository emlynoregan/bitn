Dog Attacks.  Mr J.G. Carpenter lost 30 sheep when dogs attacked and killed or mauled them on Monday night.  The sheep were in the Smelts and Mine Paddocks, within the town area.  He has been suffering losses for some time and we believe has accounted for about 18 of the canine pests.  The police cannot act as it is a civil matter.  Sheep owners can kill any dog worrying sheep and can demand damages from the dog’s owner, if ownership can be proved.  This can usually be done with the assistance of the Council Clerk for registered dogs.  The sheep owner can also advertise that he has laid baits and it is then the dog owner’s responsibility to keep their dogs off the property.
