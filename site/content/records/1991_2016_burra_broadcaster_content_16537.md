Burra Golf Club

Denis Keller, Chairman of Goyder Council presented a cheque for $175,000 to Darryl Venning, President of the Burra Golf Club on Monday.  This will assist with the greening of the Burra Golf Course.  Craig Wilson, CEO of the Mid North Regional Development Board witnessed the handover and has offered his expertise to assist the club.  The club members are enthusiastic and have completed trenching and laying pipe on eight fairways on the western side of the course in the last fortnight.  The loan raised by Council is for ten years and was made possible because many people signed as guarantors.  The club will also be seeking grants.
