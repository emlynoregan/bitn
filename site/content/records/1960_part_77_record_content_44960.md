Council Elections

Mr T.G. Perry, District and Acting Town Clerk, advises that nominations for the annual elections for the two Councils should be called during April.  Owing to the amount of time necessary before the Combined Council can be proclaimed, the nominations will not be called until after 26 April 1969.  It is expected that nominations will be called for the now Combined Council, to close on the usual date; the second Friday in May â€“ the 9th.  One member for each ward of the district and three members for Burra Town Ward will be required to give a Council of eleven members.  The position of Mayor is in doubt till the first meeting of the Combined Council.  To complete the official current term the two existing Councils will meet as a combined body for two meetings in May and June.  The new Council asked for a commencement following the first Saturday in July after the elections are completed.
