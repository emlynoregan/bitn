Open working or trenching is the feature of the Darlington scheme.  The hole is not cut perpendicularly, but an incline is left as a foundation for the rails upon which the wagons run.  This is inclined at an angle of 28°.  The workings have obtained a depth of about 10 fathoms.  Usually the wagons are loaded from hoppers at the bottom of the trench, but on Friday the rains had caused some 100-150 tons of earth to collapse into the pit and this had to be shovelled into the trucks directly.  Another 10 fathoms will have to be removed to reach the old diggings and ore.  Here a floor will be formed.  When the stuff above that level has been removed a further sinkage will be made and another level formed.  At present water is up to the 20 fathom level in the old shafts, though that could easily be lowered.  In driving among the old workings immense masses of wood will be released and it is anticipated many rich deposits of ore will be unearthed.  Certainly an immense amount of lower grade ores, which had little store set by them in earlier days, will be encountered.  Working on fissured ground above old workings requires great care.  No one wants to fall into old tunnels or shafts, which riddle the area.  Peacock’s engine will soon provide power to speed the construction of the embankment.  When the embankment is completed the wagons will take the ‘deads’ or unwanted earth to be tipped over the side, while orey stuff will be taken to the dressing tower to go through sizing and jigging.  [Details of this process follow.]  100 tons a day will be processed.  The water used in the process is to be drawn from Morphett’s Shaft by its 250 horse power engine.  At eight strokes a minute it can deliver 96,000 gallons an hour.  [Further description of the processing follows.]
