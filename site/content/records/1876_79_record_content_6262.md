SAMA 35th Report. Town land has been sold for £3053-14-0 & country lands for £244-3-2. Copper prices remain too low to justify mining. Profit for the last six months is £1349-8-8. Since the mines have closed the miners had generally obtained employment in well-sinking, fencing etc. to the north, leaving their families in Kooringa. The water in the mine had risen to within 5'6" of the 20 fathom level, considerably within the last month.
