Christmas Eve in Burra will see businesses provide the usual merry-go-round, gifts and sweets.  This amounts to contributions of c. $200 each year.  This year a group of businesses will offer a bonus for customers.  Another $200 will be distributed throughout the day.  When an alarm clock rings the customer being served will receive goods to the value of $1 or a $1 discount.  [13 businesses appear to have taken part.]
