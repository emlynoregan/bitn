Burra Stockowners’ Association met at the RSL Hall on Thursday to discuss the proposed reserved price for wool scheme and the narrowing of existing stock routes.  Elected: President, H.C. Radford and Vice-President, Don Lord.  On the question of stock routes the meeting decided to recommend to the Burra Burra DC:

King or Florieton S.R. be reduced to 3 chains for its entire length.

The Eastern S.R. be reduced to 10 chains as far as Baldina Creek and from the west to 3 chains.

The Baldina-Robertstown S.R. be reduced to 3 chains.

Redbanks Reserve be declared a dedicated reserve under the Burra Burra DC.

State President J.W. Andre, P.A. McBride of the Australian Wool Board and R.J. McCauley, Treasurer of the Association gave interesting addresses on the reserve price scheme, pointing out the advantages and disadvantages.

The Government has agreed in principle if the woolgrowers agree at a referendum.  The Wool Industry Conference has recommended the woolgrowers would contribute £20 million over 8 years.  The agreement is now for £30 million over 7 years.  The money would come from a levy not exceeding 3% of the gross proceeds of wool sold.

This money would cover:

Their contribution to the scheme’s capital.

Commitments for the promotion of wool.

Commitments for wool research.
