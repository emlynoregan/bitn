Booborowie Institute.  A public meeting recently discussed the building plans and the new land offered for cropping.  The meeting unanimously voted in favour of the proposed additions.  The plans are for two new cloakrooms each 20 ft x 14 ft, a supper room 25 ft x 35 ft and a kitchen 25 ft x 10 ft.  The ladies asked for the kitchen to be 25 ft x 12 ft to better accommodate an electric copper with a canopy, a pie warmer and an additional urn.  It was also resolved that septic conveniences be included.  Final plans will now be prepared for the tendering process.  [The rest of the article (about Â½ column) deals with the arrangements for using the 100 acres made available for cropping.]
