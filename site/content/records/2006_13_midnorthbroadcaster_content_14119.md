Burra Town Hall is being re-roofed after more than a century.  The work is expected to be completed within two weeks.  The hall dates from 1874 and replaced an earlier and smaller building of 1857.  A committee of civic minded residents had the building erected on land leased for 99 years on a peppercorn rent.  The Miners’ and Mechanics’ Institute was designed to advance the moral, social and intellectual well being of residents and to offer improvements to the working classes. John Pearce of Burra was the contractor for much of the building we see today.  There have been many changes and additions in the building’s history, including an interior facelift in 1969, a major re-development in 2001-02 and interior refurbishment in 2006.  Trevor Woods, the Goyder Council’s Assets Manager, said the building was being re-roofed using Council funds after continuing leaks had damaged parts of the interior.  Heritage Stone Restorations Ltd is rebuilding the stone wall on the southern boundary under contract to the Council.  For years the building was the focal point for the town and housed the council office, served as a public meeting place and hosted a plethora of events, including dances, movies, concerts, operas and in 1889 opened as the Provincial Roller Skating Rink.  It remains a landmark of the town’s historical commercial area.  A worthy band of volunteers helps to maintain the building and surroundings.  The Town Hall Committee spokesperson, Meredith Satchell, said they were delighted to see the building receive a new roof.  [Photos]
