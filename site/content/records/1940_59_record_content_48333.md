Fires.  A train seems to have started a fire on Koonoona Proprietors’ property on Thursday and burnt into M.J. Marchant’s property between Hanson and Farrell Flat.  About 200 acres of grass and 70 fence posts were burnt.

Another fire, about two miles further south, occurred on D. Short’s property, but was very quickly put out.
