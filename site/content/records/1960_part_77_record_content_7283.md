Burra CWA had a proud day on Friday 30 June when its new Rest Rooms were opened in memory of the late Mary Warnes.  Before this the branch has never owned their own rooms.  A large crowd gathered in Chapel Street for the opening and 15 of the 16 branches in the Warnes Group were represented.  Seven other branches were also represented. Seven foundation members of Burra branch were present: Mesdames

H. Wardle	G. Leaney	A.T. McWaters

E. Jettner	A.L. Kellock	__ Hogan Sen.

A. Marchant

The Mayor and Mayoress of Burra and the Architect Mr H.M. Jackman & Mrs Jackman were among the official guests.  Burra President Mrs H.J.B. Jennison welcomed the guests and said the rooms had been erected as a memorial to Mary Warnes as founder of the CWA in SA.  The Burra Branch had never had a home of its own, though it had had many ‘homes’ including the Town Hall where they had been very happy.  At the last AGM it was decided it was time to build a home of their own.  The site chosen was judged ideal, close to the shopping area.  Negotiations commenced with Mr L. Gordon and at that stage the Warnes Family presented the branch with the necessary finance to make the purchase.  Considerable funds were on hand and a building committee was formed.  When a likely looking plan had been developed Mrs A. Tennant arranged with Mr Jackman to draw up the plans at no cost to the branch.  The tender of A.L. Clode and Son was accepted for the construction and portions of it were sub-let.  The building was due for completion by 20 June and the opening was hurried a little because Mrs Dolling and Mrs Tennant were going away in early July.  Furnishings etc. were not quite completed.  Mrs Dolling was called on to perform the opening and in doing so recalled the youthful experiences of Mrs Warnes, who had learned the meaning of loneliness and formed a desire to form the CWA in SA, having read of its work interstate.  Now 80 Rest Rooms are owned by the CWA and many more are rented throughout the state.  Mr Rex Warnes said it was a proud moment for him as he unveiled the plaque in memory of his mother.  An inspection of the interior was followed by afternoon tea.
