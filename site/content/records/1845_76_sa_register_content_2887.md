Freedom of the Press

In what we conceive to be an English privilege we have commented with some freedom on the measures of the SA Mining Association, which in our opinion, and those of many shareholders, was likely to adversely affect not only the Association, but also the colony.

We have also thought it our duty to print a small proportion of the complaints of many correspondents among the workings classes employed by the Association.

It is well know that while we never shrink from exposing alleged misdoings of a public nature, we also are ready and happy to publish any explanatory statements in correction of any inaccuracies made by ourselves or our correspondents.

If there had been anything erroneous in anything that has appeared in our columns, the Directors of the Association knew very well that our columns were open for them to convey to the public their own version of the matter.

We had expected that gentlemen filling the honourable and responsible positions of Directors of so important and influential an Association would have maintained a dignified reserve and let their well established reputations and the results of their proceedings speak for themselves.  But it appears that these persons do not so judge.  We have instead received the following letter:

South Australian Mining Association

Adelaide, 17th October, 1948.

Sir, - I am requested by the Directors of this Association, to request that you will discontinue advertising in the South Australian Register newspaper, any notice & c., having reference to this Company.

I am, Sir,

Your obedient servant,

HENRY AYERS

Secretary.

Mr John Stephens.

We confess ourselves unable to account for this undignified and somewhat puerile act of retaliation.

We can hardly think these gentlemen believe that this withdrawal would alarm us into abandoning our duty to the public at large.  Do the Directors think that repressing adverse opinion would promote the interests of the Association?  Is this personal pique, or were the shareholders at their last meeting called upon to support this action?

We will not barter away the right to the free expression of our honest convictions, as public journalists.

But this is not the only pecuniary penalty to which we are to be subjected.  Noting less than our utter ruin will satisfy them.

To the inadvertent publication of an objectionable phrase in the letter of a correspondent, though we know not why they should suppose for a moment that it was intended to apply to them, we have offered an ample apology elsewhere.  Without any demand for an apology or explanation, and even after an apology has been known to have been offered, nine actions have been commenced against us, one at the suit of each Director.
