Redruth Methodist Sunday School held its anniversary last Sunday & Monday.  In a departure from normal the services were conducted by a layman.  Mr V. Slee headmaster of Spalding Public School gave wonderfully bright and instructive addresses.  Mondayâ€™s tea meeting was well attended.  Speeches were dispensed with and good items from the children were interspersed among the reports.
