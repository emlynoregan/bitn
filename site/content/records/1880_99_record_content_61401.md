August Herman Heinrich, farmer of Robertstown, gave evidence of buying from them a piece of solder, a soldering iron, a plane, a pair of snips and a rasp for 2/6 and later ½ lb of tobacco and a bottle of eucalyptus for 2/-. 

McDonald admitted selling the items to him.

M-C William P. Treloar of Eudunda gave evidence that he saw Carl Thylie at Point Pass, who had bought a comb and pair of scissors from them.

Luke Day gave evidence about locking his shop on 7 December about 9.30 p.m. and finding it had been entered when he returned the next morning.

The accused challenged Day’s identification of the items.

They were remanded to Thursday to allow for the arrival of witnesses from Robertstown.
