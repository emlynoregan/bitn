Fire.  A stack of baled hay at Eric Ashby’s ‘Ashrose’ was struck by lightning on 3 January during a severe electrical storm at about 2 a.m.  The fofty to sixty ton stack was well ablaze when firefighters arrived and it could not be saved.  They did however, manage to save two adjacent stacks of about 50-60 tons and 80-90 tons respectively.  There was a fall of about 30 points of rain at the time, which helped the effort.
