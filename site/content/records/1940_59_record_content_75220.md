Richard (Dick) Pascoe was appointed manager of the Waroona Branch Westralian Farmers’ Co-op Ltd twelve months ago and now new offices and a new self-service section have been opened.  Dick is the elder son of the late Mr Claude Pascoe and Mrs Pascoe (now living in Adelaide) and he was born in Burra in 1925.  He was educated at Burra Primary and High Schools and when he was 16 the family moved to Adelaide.  In WWII he saw service in the RAAF and while on service in WA he met and married a WA girl.  After the war he joined the clerical staff of Chrysler-Dodge in Adelaide.  On going to WA he was appointed to Westralian Farmers’ Co-op. and served in many departments at head Office before being assigned to the Korbel branch in the wheat belt.  For a time he resigned to take on management of the Milling Co-op., but later rejoined Wesfarmers and became manager of their Carnarvon Branch for 3½ years.  He was then appointed to Waroona branch as manager.  The branch’s activities extend from Keyesbrook to Yarloop and include a sub-branch at Pinjarra.  Twenty-three are employed at Waroona and three at Pinjarra.  He has been keenly interested in sport, previously playing football and cricket.  He was treasurer of St John’s Ambulance Assoc. at Carnarvon and although he has had little time for sport in the last twelve months, he is President of Waroona Cricket Club.  The drive and initiative of this popular young man can be seen in the rapid and extensive modernisation program he has undertaken.
