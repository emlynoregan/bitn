Burra & Districts Obedience Dog Club

On 4 February new grounds for the club were opened behind the tennis club.  About 30 people drawn from a wide area attended.  Thanks were extended to the Council and the Tennis and Golf Clubs who also assisted in the project.  The club had been formed in April 1993 by a small group of dog owners interested in obedience training.  Initial membership was 14 handlers and three instructors.  It has continued to grow.
