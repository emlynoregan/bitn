Treloar sets out to describe establishing a cattle station in Central Australia in the early 1870s and some of the incidents there while his two brothers Arthur and Walter lived on it for 20 years.

The account relates to the station later called ‘Abminga’ on the watershed of Dalhousie Springs.

Sir W.W. Hughes took up the country on the recommendation of the explorer Major Warburton whose expedition had been financed by Sir Thomas Elder & Sir W.W. Hughes.  When Hughes went to England to reside it was handed over to two nephews, Sir John & Walter Duncan.  They sent L. Mason as a practical man to report on its prospects.  The report was satisfactory and on Mason’s advice Frank Treloar’s father also took 300 miles of country on the watershed of Dalhousie Springs and later the station was called ‘Abminga’, owned by Sir J.J. Duncan, N.H. Duncan & Francis Treloar trading as Duncan & Treloar.

Arrangements were made for two bullock teams, twelve months of stores and provisions, stock and plant and the party departed Gum Creek Station 5 November 1874 for the 800 mile trip to the new station near Charlotte Waters.  There was a leader and drover and station hands and Treloar’s brother Arthur, then aged 17.  They had 300 cattle and 35 horses and picked up 250 more cattle at Mt Remarkable.  The track was not good and they waited one month at Beltana.   Arthur was convinced the leader was faint-hearted.  From Beltana to Farina they lost cattle and horses.  The leader rode to Strangway Springs and telegraphed and agistment was taken at Finniss Springs.  Eventually the leader was replaced by Mr George Deane.  When the cattle were mustered they had lost 200 since starting mainly due to mismanagement.  They got to Angle Pole, now Oodnadatta.

They got to Dalhousie Springs and found the land selected looked like quite good grazing country.

The account then describes setting up basic buildings and in December 1875 Sit John Duncan & Mr Treloar decided to visit the station.  A mail coach ran to Beltana and from there they hired six camels and an Afghan driver.  Reaching Macumba they stayed in a hut built by Mr Hart.  They didn’t have much rain, but when they awoke the creek had risen and all around was water.  By that night the whole area was flooded and there was two feet of water in the hut.  They were confined to the hut from 8th to 13th January 1876 with between 2½ & 3ft of water flowing through and all their belongings strapped to the beams.
