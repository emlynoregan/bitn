And Council is considering a contribution to the Ian Auhl mezzanine floor in the Community Library.

The Mezzanine Floor in the Burra Community Library is rapidly taking shape.  It is built above the resource room and with attractive balustrading will be the repository for Burra’s local history collection.  It is a joint venture of the Education Department, the Public Libraries Division and the District Council and will house the Ian Auhl Burra History Index and collection, the obituary index and any family histories in Burra.  Furnishings will include an original bookshelf from the Institute Library – about 100 years old and original cupboards from the District Council of Burra, of about the same age.  Tables and benches have been made from original mine timber submerged for a century and made by the Court House Hotel Co-operative when it was in action.
