Burra Town Council.

Last Tuesday the Council went into committee so that its meeting was screened from the press and the public.  If ratepayers allow this to go on they are easily satisfied in view of the serious financial blunders made at the start of the year.

A Newfoundland Dog has been attacking people near the Burra High School [Bleak House] and several people have been hurt.  It should be either chained up or destroyed.

Burra District Council has notified landowners that February has been set aside for a simultaneous and united effort to destroy rabbits.
