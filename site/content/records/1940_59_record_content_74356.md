The SA Three Day Cycling Classic was held over Friday, Saturday & Sunday and incorporated an overnight stop in Burra.  The riders sprinted into Burra at about 4.47 p.m. Saturday, soaked to the skin and covered with mud.  The leaders were Patterson (Victoria), Oliver (WA) and Hales (SA).  They riders departed at 9.30 a.m. Sunday.  The route had to be changed because the Hill River crossing was flooded between Clare and Farrell Flat and instead riders travelled to Balaklava via Waterloo, Manoora and auburn.  The winner at 5.20 p.m. on Sunday was Patterson.
