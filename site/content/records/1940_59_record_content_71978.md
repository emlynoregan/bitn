State Election.  At the declaration of the poll for the Burra District in the House of Assembly, at the Burra Town Hall on Friday, Mr P.H. Quirke (Independent) was declared the winner.  At 2 p.m. Friday Percival William Quirke had a majority of 139 and this was the basis for the declaration.

[Oddly, despite all sorts of other statistics in over a column of material, the actual final figures are not reported.]
