Accident.  On Saturday night Mr Peter Fiebig and Miss Marilyn Anderson were travelling to the Clare ‘Drive-in’ [Cinema] when just after the Farrell Flat railway crossing they were confronted by a car on the wrong side of the road.  At the last minute Peter swung right and his car was just clipped by the other vehicle causing it to overturn.  Both young people escaped with bruises and a shaking.  Mr & Mrs Thurgood of the Bon Accord Hotel were following close behind and also had to swerve off the road to avoid the oncoming car, which did not stop.
