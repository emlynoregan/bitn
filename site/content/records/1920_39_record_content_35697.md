Local Board of Health

The Health Inspector reported that Kuchenmeisterâ€™s slaughterhouse was in very good order and the new piggery was in keeping with the Health Act and an improvement on the premises vacated.

A.A. Nankivell is keeping 48 pigs on an adjacent lot without a permit and the premises there do not comply with the Act.  He said he had an application in for a position in the Burra Mine, which is before this Board of Health tonight.  Inspector E.J. Davey said unless these premises met the requirements of the Health Act he could not pass them.  Approval was granted on condition the Health Act be complied with.
