Burra Race Meeting was held in fine weather last Wednesday and the track and grounds were in fine condition.  Fields were small, but there was good racing.  It was disappointing that only two of the acceptors started in the Burra Cup, but they fought it out neck and neck.  (The three non-starters were scratched to take part at Gawler on Saturday.)  Bookmakers turned over c. $50,000.  A profit of $300 to $400 is anticipated for the club.
