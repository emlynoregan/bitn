Mary Lepley, wife of J. Lepley of Redruth had fostered the child from Mrs Graves of Adelaide and was paid £18 for keeping it forever.  She had the child 13 weeks.  The child started to fail two weeks ago.  Mary Lepley had got the child to clear herself of debts and had done so before - three weeks before Christmas - but had passed that child on to a better home.  On that occasion she had got £15.  The earlier child had been registered as Louisa Lepley.  Mary Sleeman gave evidence that the child had been well cared for.  The verdict agreed with Dr Sangster’s conclusions.
