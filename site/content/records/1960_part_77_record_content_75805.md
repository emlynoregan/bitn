Mr Chatterton Minister of Agriculture and Forests has denied that there are plans to turn the EFS into a single fire-fighting authority.  The party State Conference called for a committee of enquiry into the most efficient way to provide fire safety standards throughout the state.  While the EFS will be reorganised and a headquarters will be erected at Keswick, the present system of subsidising expenditure by EFS organisations and local governing authorities, on fire fighting equipment, will be continued.  [The recent public meeting at Gladstone is reported at length.]
