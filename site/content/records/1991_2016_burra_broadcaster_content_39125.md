Anzac Day will be commemorated with a Dawn Service at the War Memorial in Market Square at 6.30 a.m., with Rev. Michael Hillier officiating.  This will be the occasion of the dedication of a new memorial that will list the 102 names on the war memorial with the location of their graves or memorials.  The memorial is the result of extensive research by Dr Roger Cross in conjunction with the Burra History Group and members of the Burra Sub Branch of the RSL.  The Burra History Group has also arranged a display in the Town Hall of information relating to the men listed on the memorial.
