Morphett’s Enginehouse is an entry in the Mid North Tourism Awards.  The rebuilding of the enginehouse is believed to be the first of its kind in the world.  It is due to funding from the Jubilee 150 Board, the Department of Mines & Energy, the Department of tourism and the Burra Burra DC.  It stands among other ruins on the lip of the open cut.  Some of Burra’s elderly folk who witnessed its burning in 1926 can scarcely believe its transformation.  It originally housed a Cornish beam engine and was built in 1858 to facilitate the de-watering of the mine.  Its huge pump moved at 8 strokes per minute and raised 3 million gallons of water per day.  The three interior chambers have been rebuilt with a large cut-out representing the huge 80 inch cylinder which once worked there.  Many displays centred upon Cornish beam engines have been placed there and visitors can get a commanding view of the modern open cut and its lake from the top floor.  The building’s environs are equally fascinating.  The excavated miners’ adit now gives people access to the 600 foot deep Morphett’s Shaft.  In walking through the tunnel people are treading on timbers that have lain there for 140 years, some of them charred from the 1926 fire.  Around the area are archaeological artefacts, interpretive signs, Morphett’s Whim House and the old reservoir.
