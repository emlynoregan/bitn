Rev. A & Mrs Dyer and family were welcomed at a social on 22 April.  After the usual speeches of welcome and Rev. Dyer’s response, the evening moved on to farewell Miss Mavis Fairchild who was leaving Burra for the city to enter a nursing career.  Miss Fairchild had done great and wholehearted work across several branches of the church and received a parting gift from each.  F.T. Sara for the Congregation presented a leather case.  L. Thomas presented a bedroom clock from the choir.  Mr C. Fuller presented a book Why Be Good? From the Endeavour Society.  From the Girls’ Club Mr M. Morton presented a manicure set.
