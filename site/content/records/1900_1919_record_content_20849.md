Mt Bryan Agricultural Bureau met on 18 November when the discussion was on fallow.  It was mostly about how to fallow and how much breaking up of the soil should be involved.  The view was that finely tilled soil was highly desirable.  Speakers generally agreed that ‘fallow could not be worked too much’.  Moisture was best conserved on well-worked fallow.
