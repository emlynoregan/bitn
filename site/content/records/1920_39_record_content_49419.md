CWA Continental at ‘Wahroonga’ Leighton on Wednesday evening was a success thanks to the generosity of Mr & Mrs I.J. Warnes who roped in her sons and house staff to assist.  The elevated site of the house with wide balconies and spacious lawns and trees makes it an ideal choice for a continental.  There was ample room on the balcony for the piano and Burra District Band.  The program is reviewed.  Mrs Warnes said proceeds would go towards paying the rent on the Rest Room in Kooringa and part towards the Seaside Homes the CWA hope one day to build for the use of outback women.
