Hydraulic Engineer’s Report.

It is not correct to say the engine and pumps ordered are manifestly unequal to the requirements.  It is capable of delivering 2,700 gallons per hour.  The reservoir will hold 31,000 gallons and can thus be filled in 11½ hours.  The present daily consumption is under 6,000 gallons.  The pump can deliver in 3½ hours more than the town uses in a day.  If fitted with a second set of pumps the engine could lift 8,000 gallons per hour.  These would be fitted when consumption warranted the expense.  It has never been my intention to supersede any of the machinery ordered, as stated by the Town Clerk.

Any further extension required in a few years would probably be for additional storage and the present reservoir is so placed an additional one could be added on the same land if required.

With respect to the site: the well is situated on a road which the late town Clerk said was a Corporation Road and the Corporation authorised the Department to fix the engine and machinery on it.  It is a much wider road than would be required for traffic and the Corporation agreed to lay off a strip 16’ wide by whatever length was required for the engine and boiler-house etc.  The present Council are opposed to that and want the Government to acquire land adjoining the shaft.  This is merely increasing the cost without any advantage.  However much land is acquired the shaft must remain where it is and the engine and boiler with it.  It makes no sense to place them on adjoining land where the cost of connection to the pumps would be increased. (See attached plan.)

The shaft is 74’ to the water and is 6’ x 3’.

The guarantee system was intended to supply water at least cost by providing experience and expertise.  The works remain the property of the Government and are only leased to the guarantors and it is essential they are designed and carried out under the control of Government officers, who are, as a rule, better able to assess the town’s requirements better than the Corporation.  If the Corporation were to purchase the works they could do what they like.  If the works are to remain Government property I strongly recommend they be carried out as originally intended.		R.L.
