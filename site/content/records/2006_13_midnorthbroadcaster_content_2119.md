The World Archaeological Congress Symposium on Cultural Heritage and Intellectual Property Rights was held recently in Burra Town Hall.  Convenors praised the town on its successful and strategic promotion of its history.  The symposium aimed to draw attention to the gap in Burra’s tourism – its local indigenous heritage – the Ngadjuri people, who lived in the region.

Vincent Copley of the Ngadjuri Heritage Committee explained that awareness was their aim.  Stephen Kerrigan (Council CEO) represented the Goyder Council and said Council had been discussing the possibilities of a historical display with the Ngadjuri.
