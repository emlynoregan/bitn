Murray Water for Burra

Following a deputation in December to the Minister for Works, Sir Malcolm McIntosh, he promised an investigation into the position.  The Town and District Councils and the Hospital Board were represented in the deputation.  The arrival of ETSA power in the near future will enable the installation of domestic hot water systems and the ETSA power would enable pumping from Hanson.  The existing town water supply is damaging for hot water systems and is unsatisfactory when washing glasses at the hotels as well as in the dry cleaning works and for laundry use.  It is also unsatisfactory at the cool drink factory, where it leaves bottles smeary and when making ice it takes longer to freeze and does not last as long as ice.  Domestically it is poor when used to wash clothes or in baths and leaves a heavy, hard-to-remove scum.  It leaves deposits in cisterns, which prevent effective operation and the salts accumulate in garden soil, requiring the use of more vegetable matter as manure.  The hospital required the better quality of Murray water to operate its new hot water system.  Sir Malcolm said he would get a report, but this was the first occasion Burra had asked for Murray water and he had been under the impression that the local water was satisfactory.
