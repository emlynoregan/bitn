Burra Town Council

The rates declared for 1891 are: General 1/-, Health 3d and Park Lands 3d.

Annual Inspection of the Town.

[This is not usually reported in such detail so it is interesting to read where they went and if it is similar to other years it provides a useful insight into the process.]

Rabbich & Sons, butchers, Aberdeen where forewarned was forearmed.

R. Austin’s butchery, Aberdeen where, taken unaware, some improvements were possible, but allowances were made for smells due to the day being over 90°F.

The Royal Exchange Hotel where several pigs are kept on the premises, but were OK.  The rubbish needs better containment on account of the fowls hawking it around.

The Waterworks where progress in the repairs to the well was observed: the timbering should be done in a few days.  The engine was in good order, but the water ‘a killer’.

The Bon Accord Hotel was OK, but the road in front of it is to be raised.

Via Bon Accord Ford where a pile culvert is required as the creek flows here much of the year.

Reed’s Temperance Hotel [formerly the White Hart] was clean and satisfactory.

Several places in Aberdeen have verandah posts obstructing footpaths, but this cannot be cured without a proper survey.

To the main road near the Redruth Bridge where Mr Farrell’s small garden in front of the dwelling was on the footpath.
