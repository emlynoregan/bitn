Mrs Klaffus received the ‘Brodie’ chair yesterday morning.  For some years Mr Andrew Brodie, a furniture manufacturer of Unley and an old digger, has given an armchair to the oldest Australian born mother of a son serving in the last war.  Mrs Klaffus has actually held this distinction for three or four years, but it was only realised recently.  The chair, of dark wood, is upholstered in a rich ruby shade of embossed velvet and while not large is very comfortable.  The Mayor congratulated her on receiving the award.  Mr Brodie has recently died at the early age of 58.

[Andrew Brodie died 2 January 1944 at Unley aged 56.]
