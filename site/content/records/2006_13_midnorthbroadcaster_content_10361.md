Mr Matt Reilly writes in support of exploring for copper in the Burra Mine reserve.

At the peak of mining operations at the Burra Mine it gave SA such an economic boost that it was a major factor in saving SA from bankruptcy.  And this was from a relatively shallow mine with a maximum depth of 600 ft compared with 3,000 ft at Wallaroo.  In 1851 Burra was the largest inland centre in Australia with a population of about 5,000 people.

At one stage Burra had five hairdressers, four chemists, 17 hotels1, surgeons and a host of other flourishing businesses.  Were it not for Norm Foster, who crossed the floor of Parliament, Roxby Downs may still be waiting for approval, denying SA billions of dollars in earnings.  There is nothing to say Burra canâ€™t be as successful.  Without productive industry in Burra it will continue to decline, young people will leave for employment and businesses and services will be extinguished.  As a third generation Burra resident, I am proud of our heritage, but it should be balanced with future opportunities.
