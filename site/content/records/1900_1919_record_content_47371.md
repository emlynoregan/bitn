Australia Day.

Half a column outlines the coming meeting of the Supreme Court in Kooringa when as many citizens as possible would be fined for diabolical and nefarious offences.  Charges included parting his hair in the centre in order to balance properly after drinking too much Scotch, winking at the wrong girl, using hollow legs as a receptacle for beer, and harbouring sheep dogs that did not win a prize at the recent trials.
