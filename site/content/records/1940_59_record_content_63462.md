The Black Springs or Hanson Road

Acting Minister of Roads writes to C.A.S. Hawker MP.

The distance to Burra via the Black Springs or via the Hanson Road is about 19 miles.  The reconstruction of the hilly and twisting present road would be very costly.  The route via Hanson is relatively easy going.  The formation and sub-base via Hanson is completed.  A difficulty has arisen in finding cover stone for the bituminous seal, but the offer of the Burra Burra DC to send plant and men to this road could only be to the detriment of other main roads in the district.  As soon as a survey has been completed and plans and specifications prepared, considerations will be given to calling tenders for construction of the five miles south from Hanson â€“ probably early in the new year.
