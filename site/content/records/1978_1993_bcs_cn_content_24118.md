Home Invasion

Three youths forced their way into a caravan alongside a house in Burra and held down the occupant while the van was searched, apparently for cannabis.  Nothing was found and the youths then fled.  It is thought they attended the wrong address.  The persons involved are expected to be charged shortly.
