BCS.  Ten Year 10 and 11 students entered an Australian Business Week program to run a computer simulated business over a two year period.  They ran a business based on hand held computer games called Gizmos Inc. and diversified into Solar Buddy â€“ an alternative power source for mobile phones, lap top computers, walkmans and other products.  The team competed with nine others from Riverton, Clare and Balaklava and came second overall.  [Photo.]
