Hallett 2 nears completion.  AGLâ€™s new wind farm near Mt Bryan is nearing completion.  The 600 tonne crane used in the construction is due to be demolished by the end of the month.  There are 34 wind turbines in this stage.    The construction team, which peaked at around 120 persons has contributed to the local economy which will continue with the design for Hallett 4 progressing.  Site mobilisation is planned for late 2009.  AGL has also completed a test television transmission from a potential site on Gumbowie Hill as part of its investigation into poor reception experienced by residents in Hallett and surrounding townships.  A proposal on this will be presented soon to the Goyder Council.  [Photo of Stage 2 in low cloud.]
