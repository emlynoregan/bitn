Burra School.  The exterior has been painted, but an extra quote and approval is being sought to paint the bands around the building, which were not included.  The roof has been painted red.

The colour scheme for each room is printed.

The job has used about 230 gallons of paint and as well as painting, a long list of maintenance jobs has been attended to by Messrs Horop of Adelaide.
