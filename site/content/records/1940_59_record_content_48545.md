Fire.  The Eastern Fires

Emergency Services were supported with food packed at the CWA rooms, at first in the Town Hall, but later the operation was moved to the RSL Rooms where there is refrigeration.  Mrs M.R. Ashton of the Womenâ€™s Emergency Service thanked Burra and District for the wonderful response that provided supplies, labour and transport.  Station owners out east have responded already with substantial cheques for the organisation.
