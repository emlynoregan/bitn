Burra Town Council, 22 August.

Cr Lewis apologised for his absence from several meetings and in a strongly ironic comment ‘He wished to thank his colleague for the whole and gentlemanly way he had referred to his absence at last meeting.  He hoped that while he, Councillor Sampson, was a colleague of his he would always act in as graceful a manner.’

Cr Sampson’s move to have kerbing done in Commercial St failed for want of a 2nd.

The Town Clerk was instructed to have the capacity of the tube well in Market Square tested so that the troughs and a pump might be fixed.

Council resolved to give notice to persons encroaching in Best Place of that fact.

The Midland Road Board wrote requiring the Council to complete Market Street road works to the satisfaction of their surveyor.  A letter is to be sent in reply and a deputation to support it will attend the next Board meeting.
