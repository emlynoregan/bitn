Burra Hospital has received a £5,552-14-7 bequest from the estate of the late Miss A. Collins.  This attracts a two for one subsidy from the Government, making it worth £16,658-3-9.  This will cover the cost of phase two of the overall modernisation plan for the hospital.  Phase three, which will include the demolition of the ‘old hotel’ section and the erection of a new operating theatre and out-patient clinic, will be commenced as funds become available.
