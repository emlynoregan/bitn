Mr H. Pederick, the headmaster of Burra High School, was given a farewell at the conclusion of the Town Council meeting on 18 January.  The Mayor Mr W. Carpenter thanked him for his services to the town.  He had been instrumental in establishing the Avenue of Memory at the school, had helped much in the Jubilee Celebrations and had maintained a high standard of sport at the school, as well as serving the town as a Councillor.  Cr Baulderstone added his support, as did Crs Fisher, White and Topsfield.  Cr Young spoke on behalf also of the Air force Association and the Town Clerk added his support.  The Mayor then presented Mr Pederick with a tray and six glasses.  Mrs Pederick could not attend because Leith had chickenpox.
