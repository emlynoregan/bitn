The Recent Floods.

The last week’s floods saw two narrow escapes from drowning.  On Friday Harry Seeley was coming in from Austin’s Farm for supplies and was swept off the ford while trying to cross on foot.  He was spotted by Stan Field who jumped in further down and pulled him to the bank.

On Saturday Mr H. Greatbatch, manager for T. Pearce, & Cr Fennessy were crossing the creek near McWaters’ at Leighton in a light dray when the horse was swept away and the dray and men with it for half a chain.  Fennessy jumped out and swam to the bank, pulling the turnout with him.  Greatbatch climbed along the shaft to safety, but the dray then overturned.  The horse seemed to be dead and Fennessy cut the harness, but later the horse recovered.  A bridge has been sought there for some time.
