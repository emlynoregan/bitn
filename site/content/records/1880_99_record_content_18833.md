Adelaide Exhibition.  A revised plan by E.T. Smith MP for a Jubilee Exhibition.

Take a piece of parkland west of Frome Road and east of the University, from North Terrace to the Torrens.  Build a retaining wall from east to west to create two levels.  Total available space 20-24 acres.  Place the principal building on the upper level.  Place to be used for the Royal Agricultural Society.  The Royal Agricultural Society will give their present grounds to the Botanic Gardens who will in turn give 4 acres to the Zoological Society.  Temporary annexes will be needed for the Jubilee Exhibition.  Expenses are estimated at £33,350.  The Government will fund half the cost of the permanent building - say £16,000 on this year’s estimates and the same on the estimates for 1886-87.  He hopes to get gentlemen to guarantee £1,000 to £2,000 each to carry out the scheme, but believes the guarantors would not be called on.  Sir Thomas Elder has pledged to guarantee £1,000.

[Note 1887 was a convenient 50th anniversary of both the city of Adelaide and Queen Victoria’s accession to the throne.]
