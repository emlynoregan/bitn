Earthquake.  The most severe tremor for many years was felt at 11 p.m. last Sunday.  A large section of ceiling plaster fell on the bed of one person at the north end of town, just missing their head.  Plaster fell from walls in several buildings.  Houses shook and windows and crockery etc. rattled alarmingly.  Some people stayed outside after the shock which was also reported from Leighton and Ironmine.
