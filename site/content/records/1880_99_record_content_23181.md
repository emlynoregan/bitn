Midland Road Board.  The Burra Town Council sought permission to improve the grade of the main road between the Redruth Bridge and Bartholomæus’ Store.  Approved.

They also complained that the roads in town were being blinded when it was not necessary and roads were being injured thereby.  Referred to the surveyor.
