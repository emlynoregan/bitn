D. Macdonnell [sic] Steele writes in response to ‘Whom Do You Think’ to dispute that the Lawn Tennis Club was on the way out when the war came along.

At the end of April 1940 the Club’s bank credit was £35-16-10 and it possessed assets of no mean value.  It was not then, I believe, in debt to the Burra Lawn Tennis Syndicate.  Despite depleted membership due to wartime enlistments, an attempt was made to continue playing, but with reduced subscriptions the club was in debit balance early in the 1941 season.  Many generous donors kept the courts watered and maintained till the end of the 1941-42 season when activities were suspended.  Actually just prior to the outbreak of the war the club was successful enough to be considering enlarging its playing area.  The transport difficulties are exaggerated by ‘Whom Do You Think’.
