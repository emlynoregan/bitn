Burra Amateur Swimming Club.  The final meeting for 1932 was at the Mine Pool last Saturday.  A large crowd attended.  A feature of the afternoon was the spectacular diving of L. Winkley and J. Voumard who dived from cliffs of about 35 ft & 55ft.  There were pleasing displays of swimming by those newly taught in the Learn to Swim Campaign and diving from the spring board.
