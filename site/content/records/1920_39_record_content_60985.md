Anzac Centenary Sports were very successfully held on 2 May, under the auspices of Burra RSL supported by the Burra Cycling and Athletic Club, the local troop of the 18/23 Light Horse, a number of prominent racing men and the Motor Cycle Club of SA.  The weather was very good and the cycling and pedestrian tracks were in excellent condition.  The Burra Racecourse is possible one of the finest sites in the North for meetings of this kind.

The gate money was c. £100 and people came from places as far as Terowie in the north and Riverton in the south.  There were a record 262 entries.  Loudspeakers carried the announcements all over the ground.  The program was varied and interesting, with things under way at 11 a.m.

The half-mile wheel race was won by local rider Rod Wilson.

The Gallipoli wheel race was won by visiting riders.

The Anzac wheel race had four heats before the final was somewhat marred by four riders falling, but in the end the winner was Rex Opperman with Leo Taylor second; both local riders.

The Mid-North Scratch Race Championship went to J.R. Martin.

In the pedestrian events Burra runner J. Pengilly won both the Sheffield and the 75 yard sprint.

The RSL Flat Race Handicap went to J.A. Burton and the 100 yards Consolation to S.E. Truscott of Waikerie.

The motor cycle events were dusty due to the lack of rain.  H. Denton took out the Motor Cycle Handicap and the 8 lap Mid North Dirt Track Motor Cycle Championship went to L. Fredericks, who also took out the Mongolata Motor Cycle Handicap.

In the horse events Greensborough won both the Andrew Tennant Handicap and ‘The Gums’ flying handicap.  The popular Lynch Draught Horse Race this year drew only five entrants, but was well contested, finally being won by Graham Dow on T. Kallio’s Wait Awhile.

The Military Events were carried out with order and precision.

The crowd was orderly and the police had a quiet day.
