Sonia Klembt, under the name Charlotte Clauzel, finished her poem of 101 lines The Man Beneath the Hat, Atop the Horse in 2005.  The poem is based on four main characters who personify the Australian stockman and rodeo cowboy.  The poem became a song lyric and she now dreams of seeing it made into a film on Australian rodeo.  Ms Klembt was originally from Burra and has been working on the project for eleven years.

Burraâ€™s Sharyn Roberts has become the first female manager of an Elders branch in SA.  She was in Adelaide for five years before coming to Burra and has been with Elders for 23 years in total.

Carmen Jacka from Clare has been appointed Elders Merchandise Sales Representative in Burra.
