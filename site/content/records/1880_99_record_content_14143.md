Redruth Court, 20 August.

Jeffery Pearse fined 10/- for a stray cow.

J. Jenkins fined 3/- for driving loose horses in Commercial Street between 10 a.m. & 5 p.m.

George Mayger fined 10/- (or 7 days) for being drunk in Market Square.

James Henderson jun.	Thomas Price

Archibald Ker		William Hopkins

Patrick Lally		Samuel Barnett

Were each charged with insulting behaviour in that they threw eggs at passengers and each other at Drew’s Corner in Market Square on 2 August.

Price, Ker and Hopkins pleaded guilty and Henderson, Lally and Barnett not guilty.

F-C Radford gave evidence of damage to Miss Morgan’s dress and that one egg landed on Mr Drew’s daughter’s jacket.  He saw Henderson, Barnett & Price run away and heard Henderson say ‘I gave him one right on the back of the head.’

He did not actually see the eggs thrown.  There were the remains of about five eggs on Drew’s verandah and several more between there and Symon’s butcher shop.

All the boys were discharged with a severe caution.

William Develaing was charged with being drunk while in management of the Royal Exchange Hotel, Aberdeen.

Thomas Halls gave evidence of Develaing’s drunken state and of a scuffle between him and Halls.  The defendant had abused the witness, calling him an informer and a scoundrel.

Henry Cox, a drover, corroborated Halls story.

M-C George Innes saw the scuffle and the defendant was the worse for drink.

The defendant had given Halls in charge, but did not later come to sign the complaint and refused to prosecute.

William Develaing denied that he pulled Halls into the bar, but said words arose because he had refused to serve beer to Alf Schutz who was a prohibited person.  Halls had rushed down the bar and tried to choke him and in the struggle Develaing’s shoulder had been dislocated.  He was not drunk.

Morris Rabbich described the assault, but did not think the defendant was ‘uproariously tight’.
