St Mary’s Organ Recital

On Sunday 14 November a concert celebrated the anniversary of the installation of the pipe organ.  Dr J.V. Peters, University of Adelaide Organist and Senior Lecturer of the Elder Conservatorium of Music, played the organ.  Over 150 people attended.  Scripture readings and prayers accompanied the music.   Music included three pieces by Samuel Wesley, a voluntary by William Walond and Henry Purcell’s Trumpet Tune & Air.  The Rector, Rev. G.D. Sibly, gave an address on the history of pipe organs and traced the origins of the St Mary’s instrument.  It was decided on 20 January 1901, after much discussion, to purchase a pipe organ costing not more than £350.  The instrument was dedicated and opened by the rector, Rev. Wightwick, on 22 October 1901.  Dr Harold Davies of the Elder Conservatorium played at the dedication.  The organ has 588 pipes ranging from 16 ft to 2 inches.  The second part of Dr Peter’s recital comprised music pf J.S. Bach: three chorale preludes and the Prelude and Fugue in G. major.
