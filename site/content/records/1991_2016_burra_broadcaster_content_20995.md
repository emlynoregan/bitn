Aberdeen Croquet Club.  From the National Trust Archives by Meredith Satchell.

The club was founded 12 April 1928.  Today all that remains is the stone building which once served as club rooms.  The Ludgvan Street bypass of the late 1980s cut through the greens, the shelter shed and the adjoining stone wall.  The opening of the club took place in February 1929.  The club had first looked at various sites, including one near the railway line, but they decided there would be too much dust from the saleyards.  The site they chose was previously the home of the Aberdeen Tennis Club.  The Tennis Club had moved on to a site adjoining the children’s playground on Smelts Road.  Working bees of members’ husbands and sons did much of the hard work in preparing the site.  Trees were removed and stone excavated to build a pavilion/clubroom (not the surviving building, which was acquired later).  T.H. Woollacott loaned a horse and dray to assist.  In November 1928 W.J. Thomas Jnr built the stone walls of the clubroom free of charge and Mr R. Fuss put up the woodwork.  Mr R. Steer did the painting.  At the opening on 27 February 1929 the President Mrs Emma Sara made a speech and so did Rev. W.O. Harris.  The Mayor attended and accepted the deeds to the grounds as a gift to the Council.  Council accepted on the condition that the grounds were not used on Sundays.  After the Mayor’s speech Cr Woollacott responded and then the Mayoress declared the grounds open.  A sumptuous tea followed, accompanied by a number of competitions.

Wilkinson’s the wholesalers of Adelaide had been asked to provide some teacups.  They obliged with five dozen teacups labelled ‘Viceroy’ with the stipulation that only ‘Viceroy Tea’ was to be used in them and that any breakages had to be paid for, as they were given on loan.  Presumably the survivors of the set are still on loan in their display cabinet in the Market Square Museum.

In 1988 an archaeological study was undertaken on the site of the old White Hart Hotel and in a brief time a 70 page document was produced.  The Croquet Club, which was located behind the hotel site, got only a brief mention, along with some photos of the pavilion/clubroom to be demolished as part of the new road scheme.  In 1916 the White Hart (of some 22 rooms) was being used as a residence and was owned by Mr James Reed.  It was among the oldest buildings in the town, having been erected in 1851.  A fire in 1916 created great damage and by 1928 there was little of the building left.  In later years this area adjoining the croquet club was cleared up and trees were planted to beautify the ground.

The archaeological survey records many finds from the hotel site and among the other fragments there was a piece of china bearing the word ‘Viceroy’.  One cannot but wonder whether in fact this came from a later era that the hotel and instead dates from a time when tea leaves and the odd broken cup were quickly dumped over the wall of the croquet club.

[A list of founding members follows.]

Of course the Aberdeen Croquet Club is not to be confused with the Burra Croquet Club; the two [ends of the town] were quite distinct communities.
