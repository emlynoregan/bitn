South Australian Mining.  (Editorial)

[The editor comments on the item immediately above.  He considers the writer has shown great shrewdness and intelligence.  And ‘there is unfortunately too much truth in [his] sarcasm’ when he says [mines were abandoned as unprofitable, because shiploads of malachite and red oxide were not found above the water level.]"]
