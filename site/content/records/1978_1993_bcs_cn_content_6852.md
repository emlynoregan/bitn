Helen R. Stockman

I am the wife of Peter Stockman; we have three sons all attending BCS.  I have a longstanding interest in local government and have attended many Council meetings as an observer, finding them extremely interesting.  Common sense and sound decision making are the important aspects of Council work.

I would promote the interests of Burra in terms of street sealing and community development, tourism etc. as well as taking an interest in the overall financial management of Council.
