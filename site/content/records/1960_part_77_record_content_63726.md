Samin Ltd’s Stage 2 Program

The commencement of stage 2 is scheduled for September 1973.  The copper ore body at Burra was worked over by hand picking as a high grade deposit between 1845 and 1877, contributing valuable wealth to the state at a critical time.  It was later worked on a small scale by the Burr [Burra] Copper Co. 1901-07.  No further work of importance was undertaken till December 1961 when the SA Department of Mines began investigation.  By December 1961 they had discovered interesting reserves of oxidised copper ore.  Late in 1969 Samin Ltd acquired the leases and with State Government assistance in providing necessary infrastructure, it commenced to develop the property.

Samin and Australian Mineral Development Laboratories in Adelaide (Amdel) designed a plant utilising an ammonia leaching process capable of treating 250 tons of ore per day.  The plant, which commenced operation as the first stage of the development, is producing c. 90 tons of copper concentrate per month.  The plant has also been used to provide the metallurgical information needed to design the stage 2 plant.  This will considerably increase throughput and recovery.  The mining rate will increase to 400,000 tons of ore per year and production to about 6,500 tons of copper concentrate.  The new plant involves roasting in a roaster 64 feet high, with 12 hearths, fired by natural gas, before treatment.  Santos is supplying the natural gas from the Moomba-Adelaide main via a 14 mile branch line commissioned from the Natural Gas Pipelines Authority.  Tenders for this line are expected to be called in January with construction in February-April 1973.  The heat from the waste gases and from the hot material leaving the roaster will generate steam for other process work.  The waste gases will be filtered to be completely clean before discharge.  After roasting the ore will be ground to a fine powder in a 9 ft diameter x 17 ft long ball mill driven by an 11,000 volt motor.  The diameter of this 1,100 h.p. motor is over 12 ft and it weighs nearly 20 tons.  This is one of the largest motors connected to the ETSA system and special provisions have been made to protect other consumers from interference.  ETSA will also be installing two 1,500 KVA transformers to cope with the increased load from other plant motors.  After grinding the copper will be extracted from the calcined ore by agitation leaching instead of the present percolation leaching method.  The new tanks for this have been installed and are set in the ground to eliminate possible spillage.  Stainless steel pressure filters will ensure all ammonia fumes are contained.  Most other sections of the existing plant will also be extended.  A.L. Clode & Son have already enlarged the maintenance workshop.

Employment will not be greatly increased by this development.
