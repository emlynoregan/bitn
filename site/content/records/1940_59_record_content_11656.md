Sgt Wireless Air Gunner Laurie Sams RAAF writes to his parents Mr C. & Mrs E.D. Sams of Mt Bryan.  Since the letter was written they have been advised that he was reported missing believed killed.

The letter was dated 19 June.  He was then fit and well and greatly enjoying a lot of flying over England with his crew of four Aussies and a Canadian pilot.  They had been flying over England and also to Scotland and across to Ireland and back.  He was greatly impressed by the beauty of the landscape from the air and also mentions the fogs they had to contend with.  Brian Riggs from Burra had just arrived at their base and they had met in the mess.  His first night flight was a 6¼ hour run to Cologne as part of a 1,000 plane raid, which he described as a marvellous experience ‘which made him feel as happy as hell’.

[His description of the Cologne raid occupies about ½ column.]
