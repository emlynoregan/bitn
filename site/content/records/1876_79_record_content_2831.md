Trip to the Murray. From a correspondent.

Crops east of Baldina were very bad and many will not be worth harvesting. 640 acre properties here are not large enough as a combination of pastoralism and grain is needed. Feed for animals is OK, The wharves at North West Bend [Morgan] are taking shape. . The town is yet to be surveyed, but already some temporary businesses have appeared. Mr Symonds has a hotel with excellent accommodation. Care to keep activities above flood level will be needed. Blanchetown was quiet.
