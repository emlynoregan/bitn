Advertorial on The White Cedars Café

Francis Walling and Putu Suta have had a good response to the opening in February of their café specialising in Balinese cuisine in Burra.  The café also provides take-away meals.  Not yet licensed, they are looking at applying for a BYO licence.  Self-taught chef Putu, who migrated to Australia in January last year, has experience in a number of cuisines, including Italian and Chinese.  He is also a trained classical Balinese dancer.
