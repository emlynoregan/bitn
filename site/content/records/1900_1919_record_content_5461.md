Rev. W.F. James gave an address at the Redruth Methodist Church last Thursday evening looking back over the 12 months of his ministry there.  He had travelled some 5,000 miles in the circuit.  Trust debts had been reduced about £50.  An organ had been purchased for Hanson and about £4 added to the account for a new church there.  Over £3 was banked towards a new organ for Booborowie.  £100 was raised for new furniture and renovation of the manse and to pay three year’s interest on £100 for the late Primitive Methodist Church as well as a new fence for the circuit paddock.  Two years’ interest had been paid on the £50 debt at Westbury and £6-10-0 spent on repairs there and in the Copperhouse building and there was £3 in hand towards renovating the Westbury building.  [Note the Copperhouse building was the old Primitive Methodist Chapel which was later bought by the Education Department for the school.]
