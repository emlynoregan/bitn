The Eastern Plains.  A lunatic has been frightening womenfolk to the east for some weeks.  He has been wandering about with a gun and now and again approaches homesteads and demands food.  Last Wednesday he visited Redcliffe.  Mrs McBride tried to phone in, but could not make contact till evening.  M-C Queale went out Thursday and found the man in the pigsty where he had spent the night.  He seemed quite harmless, saying he found the bed quite comfortable and not too smelly, but the fleas were awful.  He said his name was Smithers and after examination he was sent to the mental home.
