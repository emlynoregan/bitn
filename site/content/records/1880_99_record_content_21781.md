A correspondent disagrees with proposals to make the RVF more professional and inveighs against accepting C.C. Kingston into decent society:

‘such scum ought to be held up as a specimen to the world’

‘The Government is rotten and not worth the place they occupy.’

He supports the idea of work locally for the unemployed as would flow from a reservoir at Baldina for irrigation.
