The Holidays.  Christmas Day was quiet, but there were sports at Victoria Park on Boxing Day.  The weather was favourable for sports and the many picnic parties organised.

On Boxing Day members of the lodges assembled at the Institute and marched to Victoria Park led by the Burra Band.  This was hardly a success due to the small number of members who marched.  The sports themselves were successful, though gate takings were down on last year.  The track, though improved, needs asphalting.  Until this is done money will be wasted annually as even after spending on it, rain and other factors destroy the surface.  This year saw £10 outlaid for only a partial success.  Entries in the Sheffield, hurdles and 440 yards did not meet the prizes given and so they were cancelled.  Bicycle events remained the most popular.  Takings at the concert were up on last year by several pounds and the Gawler Dramatic Co.’s sensational drama A wife’s Peril was staged very creditably.
