United Friendly Societies’ Demonstration is written of by ‘Whip’ who lauds sport as the great pastime: calling it a recreation, a pleasure and a blessing.  He urges all to go to the day and enjoy it and repay the hours of work given freely by the organisers.  A new and good track has been laid down on the Polo Ground.  All indications are for a great financial success as well as a good meeting on Boxing Day.
