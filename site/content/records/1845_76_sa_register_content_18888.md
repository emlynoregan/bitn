The Wesleyan Minister Rev. W.S. Worth paid visits to stations in the Northeast.  On Tuesday 9 August he was at Mr Hiles’ Mungibbie [a.k.a. Munjibbie] Station.  Mr Hiles made ample provision for his guests and though 35 miles from Burra 80 to 90 people sat down to tea.  Afterwards Mr Alexander McCulloch presided and Rev. Worth gave his lecture on George Stephenson as previously arranged.  The Kooringa Wesleyan Choir added their services and brought a harmonium with them.  At the close Mr Worth stated the financial position of the circuit.  He said that although the usual expenses of the circuit were met by income, there was at present a £65 debt due to the recent change of ministers and other factors.  A collection was made and the sum of £50 was given or promised.  (£17-2-6 was collected.)  The tea meeting was deemed one of the most pleasant evenings those present had ever spent.
