Burra Town Council, 31 May

Cr Radford said two of the lamps in North Ward were not being lighted – the one near Thamm’s was very necessary in winter.

A considerable discussion on lamps followed from which it is clear that lamps always gave a great deal of trouble and were the focus of considerable vandalism.

Cr Radford moved that the lamp near Bailey’s in Aberdeen be moved to Fuss’s corner.

Rep. Foster writes he has got the ambulance cost reduced to £200.

The Town Clerk suggested the Council get prices for installing the sealed pan system to replace the pit system [for toilets].
