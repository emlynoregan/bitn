Offences. As usual a number of cases were concerned with animals that were in the wrong place. This session most were illegally depastured on Crown lands. Most sessions had several cases of straying animals within the town.

Henry Walker was charged by the Ranger with "breaking up the road near Mr Josiah Thomas's, by taking away sand therefrom, on March 26." It seems he did not think he was doing harm as he had been employed to do so by Sara & Dunstan and he was unaware that the order had been revoked. Fined £2 +£1 costs.
