Burra Burra Copper Co. shareholders met at the Institute on Friday.  There was a large attendance requiring extra seating.  E.W. Crewes presided.  The chairman said that 18 months ago there was a move to float the Burra Mine, but not a lot of capital was forthcoming.  It was thought that the mine would end the trouble and distress of the town.  We were then given to think that the mine would be developed systematically and that work would commence soon.  The meeting was not called to dictate to the directors, but to discuss the matter in a friendly manner.  Complications had arisen, but were being overcome and he hoped the property would be active soon.

Dr J.I. Sangster moved the meeting request information from the directors re the prospects of the mine starting work.  Shareholders had a right to know at least when it was intended to develop the property.  2nd W.E. Jordan and carried.

W.J. Davey moved that considering the present price of copper the meeting feels that valuable time is being lost.  Nothing appears to have been done in 18 months.  Certainly the Snow process was in course of erection and no doubt the treatment of the heaps would be shortly commenced.  With copper at £64-£65 a ton the outlook was bright.  2nd T.W. Pearce and carried.

Dr J.I. Sangster moved that in view of the lack of employment and the distress in Burra and the decrease in town population it is a matter of national and local importance that steps be taken to start the mine as soon as possible.  If water was pumped out of the mine work could be found for many immediately.  Most had not invested to get fat profits, but to advance the town and bring back a tide of prosperity.  The town was getting poorer and residents were still leaving.  2nd E.J. Cox.

W.J. Richards spoke in support as did Rev. W.G.M. Murphy.  J. Drew thought the motion awkward.  The directors were likely to reply that they were not philanthropists.  The directors were in it to make money and not for the benefit of Burra.  A report had been circulated that owing to a clause in the agreement between Messrs Snow & Elder, Smith & Co. and the Burra Burra Copper Co. no water could be pumped into the Burra Creek because the contract between the parties gave them the right to treat ores in the creek.  But this difficulty could be overcome by pumping into a different part of the creek.  He did not object to the motion, but thought it would carry little weight.

Rev. Murphy then thought he would withdraw his support.
