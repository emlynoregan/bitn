The maternity Wing doors are not fly or mosquito-proof.

The old Nurses’ Dormitory should be cleaned up and two beds kept ready for isolation cases.

New Nurses’ Quarters are an urgent necessity.  If we don’t get these, we will not get nurses.  For the last three years we heave been operating with up to 20 patients with Matron and one or two Sisters and three or four Pros [i.e. Probationers].  This is difficult and inefficient.

Work Needed in One or Two Years

A Children’s Ward is highly desirable.

Minor surgery like stitching cuts or opening abscesses, is now done in the Ward or Main Theatre, infecting both places.  Private Room number 5 should be made available as a Minor Theatre for this sort of work.

The ante-room of the Theatre is over-crowded and the Private Room number 4 should be made into an autoclave room and autoclaved linen and other necessities for surgery should be kept there.

Rooms 1, 2 & 3 should be converted to a Children’s Ward and a new wing of private rooms made in the area of the wall dividing the garden for the Men’s Ward.

A full estimate of the work needed to bring the Hospital up to standard should be compared with the estimated cost of a new hospital.  We believe that with a long range view the difference in costs would be so small that the venture of a new hospital would be better.
