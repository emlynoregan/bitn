Electricity for Burra

Mr Hawker MP has advised that power from ETSA would be facilitated if the Town Council passed a resolution desiring ETSA to extend its mains to Burra, saying that the Council does not intend to extend the franchise to the Burra Electric Supply Co. and that it suggests ETSA takes over the Company’s distribution system as soon as possible.

As a consequence a motion was passed on the above lines and another was passed to notify the Burra Electric Supply Co. of Council’s action, but requesting them to continue to supply power until ETSA is in a position to take over.
