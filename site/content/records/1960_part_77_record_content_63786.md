It was with mixed feelings that I read in the Sunday Mail of 5 November 1972 the disappointment of an overseas tourist who drove to Burra and expected to see the old open cut and wander freely around the old mine area.  None of the brochures he said indicated that people could not get near the old buildings or the old mines.  This highlights the need for more up-to-date publicity.  A somewhat misleading impression could be given by the current Council brochure, the National Trust-Ampol film and the Burra Sketchbook.  These date from 1967, 1967 and 1968 respectively and at that time the re-opening of the mine seemed a very remote possibility.  This year the Council is to bring out an up-to-date tourist brochure.  Also in 1973 I hope a new Burra book called Burra in Colour will be available.  Rigby Ltd has given a young photographer Peter Finch and me the contract to produce the book.  This will bring the Burra story up-to-date.  The film cannot be up-dated and is now an historic record in colour of the mine area prior to the present mining operations.  What is needed is a new film.  One can understand the visitor’s disappointment and it is a pity Dr McKinnon was not referred to Mr Rich or Mr O’Connor, as I am sure he would have been shown around the mine area.  In any case most of the mine buildings are still accessible.  Graves’ Pump House has been spared and the [Peacock’s] chimney resited – a reasonable compromise.  I, like Mr Baulderstone, felt a keen disappointment at the loss of the old mine area and some of the mine buildings.  I have also been disappointed that other historic buildings in the town have been bulldozed without knowledge or consideration of their tourist value.  Samin has shown goodwill and the National Trust and Council have, I believe, come to respect each other’s points of view. Tourism and mining cannot be separate developments; it is no longer practicable.  Such statements as those made by Dr A.J. McKinnon are fair comment and must be taken into account.
