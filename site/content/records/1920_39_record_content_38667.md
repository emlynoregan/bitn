‘Citizen’ of Burra writes a letter of over 1 column on taxation and the trade depression.  The writer points to the fact that those who pay direct taxation are c. 10% in Britain and the 90% of those who do not are the section who obtain the unemployment dole, free education, old age pension, other pensions and insurances.  They have the biggest say in the elections and so the 10% who pay taxes are in an unenviable position.  But as direct taxes rise we get to a point where they are destructive to their source – a position reached in Australia.  The economic law must now overpower the fable of the ‘bottomless purse’.  What options has the Government – reduce social services or cut loan interest, but a bargain or contract once made should be kept.  Furthermore once we have defaulted it will not be possible to go back to the old system of contract and this will probably lead to capital levies and confiscation of private property in place of loans.  Various forms of protection offer an alternative, but the most drastic offer help only under certain conditions.  Revenue must be produced by indirect taxation which the whole nation shares and the revenue gained must be devoted to the revival of trade.
