Burra Burra Show Inc. reports that the committee did not raise the price of rent due from side-show operators.  For ten years it has been 1/- per foot with a minimum charge of 2/6.  The proprietors formed themselves into a guild and were prepared to pay 6d a foot only.  They have tried it at other shows whose committees have capitulated.
