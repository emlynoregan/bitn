Obituary.  Mrs J.K. Clemson of Burra died at Burra Hospital on Friday aged 69.  She was born at Lincoln in the UK and came to Australia after WWI.  In that war she served in the British Army as a nursing sister and was stationed at Eastbourne Hospital.  There she met and married Sgt J.K. Clemson of the AIF.  After the war the couple came back to Australia and lived in Victoria where Mr Clemson was employed by the Water Board.  They remained in that state for some years before coming to SA, eventually taking up residence in Burra a year or two prior to WWII.  She was reputedly a splendid nurse and particularly in the days after arriving in Victoria was always ready to exercise her professional help for those in need.  She is survived by a husband and a daughter, Elizabeth, who is mother to the deceased’s three grandsons and who lives in England.

[Clarice Lizzie Ann (maiden name unknown) died at Burra 7 March 1952 aged 69.]
