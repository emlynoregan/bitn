Burra Hospital Maternity Wing.  From the Register: Burra’s Babies

A deputation from the Burra Burra Hospital Board waited on the Chief Secretary, Hon. J.G. Bice on Tuesday seeking a £ for £ subsidy for a maternity wing.  John Melrose of Ulooloo has offered £1,000 and Mrs W.P. Barker of Adelaide and late of Baldina £750.  Mr Winnall said the wing would serve an area from Farrell’s Flat to Hallett and from Booborowie in the west to 100 miles or more to the east.  The gifts were conditional on the £ for £ subsidy.  The Chief Secretary undertook to bring the matter before Cabinet and to let them know if the amount would be in the next estimates.

In Thursday’s Register Dr Thomas B. Ashton wrote saying he found the paragraph headed ‘Burra’s Babies’ offensive to the nurses of the district.  One nurse at one home has attended over 390 cases and the other 400.  During 10 years he says he has not known of a single septic maternity case and he complains of State Socialistic ideas invading medical matters.

The following day John Melrose said in the Register that the deputation had cast no reflection on either nursing homes or nurses and indeed both were given credit for their work.  The object of the donors was to provide a service for those too poor to pay for a private home or nurse.
