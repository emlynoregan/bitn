Senator O’Halloran (ALP) & Mr Lacey, Leader of the Opposition in SA visited Mongolata last Thursday and on Friday evening addressed a gathering in Market Square where the Mayor presided.

Mr Lacey was impressed by Mongolata, which was the most prosperous goldfield in SA.  He saw it as a great benefit to the town and as offering prospects for further employment on the field.  He thought the Government should be offering more assistance.  He spoke at some length about alleviating the depression and providing employment and he is reported in about one column of detail.

Senator O’Halloran gave a very party-political speech with one eye on the next election, which he felt would be held earlier than most people believed.  He outlined the party’s policy, especially with respect to banking and finance in a speech that is reported in about ⅔ column.
