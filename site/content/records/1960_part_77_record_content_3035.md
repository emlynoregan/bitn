Local History

So far only five persons have handed in their names as likely to attend a proposed conference in October on ‘Early Burra and Its History’.  Please notify the Headmaster of the High School Mr M.W. Scriven by next Saturday 23 July.  Thirty people are needed to make the conference worthwhile or it will be abandoned.
