Fire.  Lord’s Well homestead, the property of V.A. Riggs, 100 miles east of Burra, was burnt to the ground last Thursday night.  It was an eight-roomed wood and iron building and only a stone chimney remains.  None of the valuable old furniture could be saved.  At the time in the house were Mr & Mrs John Riggs and baby, Mr Jim Riggs and an employee.  Mrs Riggs woke to the smell of smoke and gave the alarm.  The baby was barely rescued in time.  The fire seems likely to have started in the kitchen and a kerosene refrigerator is the suspected cause.
