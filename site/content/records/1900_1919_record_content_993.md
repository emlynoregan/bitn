Obituary.  Mrs Mary Smith, wife of D. J. Smith died in Burra on Thursday, 3 May, aged 50.  They went to live at Mongolata 23 years ago, being among the first to do so.  Despite bad years they have made a comfortable home.  She leaves a husband, three sons and a daughter.

[Ages given donâ€™t quite match up, but marriage records suggest she was probably born Mary Crowley and married David John Smith at Mintaro 3 May 1870]
