Frank Wallace Clare Radford, youngest son of the late David Radford of Glenora Station, died at Burra Hospital 14 September.  He was born at Angaston in 1877 and in 1879 the family went to Quorn.  In 1891 his father took up country east of Burra, now Glenora Station where his sons were well grounded in station life.  In 1904 Clare Radford joined his brothers [David Hubert] and [Maurice Arnold] in partnership at Canegrass Station, later acquiring Glenora, Yubana and Ballanbreni and 15 years ago he went to live at the latter near Spalding.  In younger days he was well known as a first class cricketer and footballer and organised cricket teams for the Country Cricket Carnival.  He had a rich baritone singing voice that was much in demand.  He was a strong supporter of the Liberal Union and later of the Liberal Federation, being President of the Stanley District Committee and the Spalding Branch.  He was a member of the Spalding Masonic Lodge.  In 1910 he married Miss Edith Killicoat, daughter of the late P. Killicoat of Abberton Park.  He is survived by a widow and two children: [Hubert Clare Radford] & [Lorna Clare Radford].  [David Hubert] Bert Radford and Maurice Radford of Canegrass are brothers and Mrs J.G. Wardle of Aberdeen is a sister.
