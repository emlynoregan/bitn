Internet.  More than 250 people in Goyder have registered their wish to access the internet with a broadband service as well as cheaper STD phone calls in the future.  This is up from 28 when the campaign started.  The changes to internet access are being sought by Councils in the Central Local Government Region and the Broadband Demand Aggregation Program, which Goyder Council supports.
