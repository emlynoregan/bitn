17 June 1987

Burra School & Community News

The BCS Council advises that the school printery, which produces this paper, will close on 30 June 1987.

An annual loss of $4,000 to $5,000 has been identified over the past two years.  This has been generated despite the outstanding efforts of Trevor Walsham the printer, who has saved significant amounts by servicing the equipment himself.  The cost of the Community News would also have been greater had the printer and his assistant not donated several hours work each week without charge.

The Education Department will thoroughly investigate the finance of the printery and eventually the machinery will be sold.  A financial statement will then be made public.  A joint committee of Finance & Newspaper Committee and Apex Club members has met and agreed on a course of action for the paper.

The school will lease a large rapid photocopier, which will also print the paper.  Burra Apex Club will continue to offer support.  All this work will be done by volunteers with no wages paid.  To make this venture a success donations will have to increase.  Your support of your paper is now imperative.
