Irrigation.  World’s End farmers are petitioning the Government for the damming of the Burra Creek near World’s End to establish a supply for irrigation purposes.  Costs would seem to be against them as a 12” main costs about £2,000 per mile.  It is impossible for the eastern farmers to survive without irrigation.
