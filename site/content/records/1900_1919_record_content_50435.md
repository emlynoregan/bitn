Sheep Show.  The Royal [Agricultural] Society in Adelaide is to run a non-competitive sheep show on the lines of the Burra Sheep Show, having stolen the pattern from Burra and it is doing all it can to stop any more being held in Burra.  The question of whether another Burra Sheep Show should be held was held over at a meeting of the local committee that was adjourned till 1 June.
