Bike for Bible Marathon

This event raises money for the Bible Society and began when three riders rode from Sydney to Melbourne in 1984 and raised $2,000.  Twenty-three years later more than $10 million has been raised to aid the Bible Society Literacy Development Program.  One team, which has been involved since 1989, passed through Burra at the weekend, having come from Perth on the way to Sydney.  Sixteen riders started from Pert, with other joining along the way, to reach a total of c. 58.  Last year the group raised c. $85,000.  [Photo.]
