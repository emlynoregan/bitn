He admitted seeing ‘a chap lying face down in a doorway and there was blood all over the place.’

He had not mentioned this body to anyone because it had slipped his memory.

He denied firing a shot at either Lance Phillips or Miss Mattner.

He denied hiding the rifle in a rabbit hole.

He admitted there were powder marks around the bullet hole in his boot.

He denied having arranged with Miss Mattner to say somebody else had been there.

Witness then arrested Weiss for the murder of Lance Phillips.

Witness then returned to ‘Studholme’ and found the rifle hidden in a rabbit burrow.

On further questioning Weiss admitted it was his rifle and that it was the one that he had fired and killed Lance Phillips.

Weiss also admitted that he had put a bullet through his foot after shooting Lance Phillips and then retrieving his bike and was on the road when he met Bob Phillips.

MC France gave evidence that corroborated that of MC Sparrow.

When Weiss had volunteered to tell them everything, Weiss then dictated a statement (taken down by MC Wiecks) in his own words and had signed it after it had been read over to him.  MC France then read Weiss’s statement.

He did not mean to shoot anyone.  It was pointing at Lance and Weiss had the gun on his hip and it went off in the excitement.  He said June said she would protect him in court and if June had told him before that she had not been married and had been in gaol he would have dumped her straight away.

The accused refused to answer any questions on the grounds that his replies might incriminate him in any subsequent proceedings taken against him.

[The report runs to some 7½ columns.]
