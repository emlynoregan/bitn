Burra Regional Art Gallery.  Assistant Secretary and Curator Wendy Douglas reviews the year.

She reports a very successful year and thanks in particular Peter Harvey, Glenys Christopher and her ‘hanging group’.  She is glad to have had the opportunity to support regional artists.  There has been an increase in the applications by artists for individual exhibitions.  She is glad to have formed a positive relationship with the Country Arts SA manager Laura Van Haven, which will aid in securing appropriate Touring Exhibitions in the future.
