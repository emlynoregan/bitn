Burra Show was a great success on Wednesday at Victoria Park.  The weather looked threatening at dawn, but had improved by 9 a.m.  Good wheat was exhibited from the eastern country by W. Heinrich and F. Duldig.  Dairy produce was better this year.  Poultry numbers were down, but quality was up.  Sheep were stronger than ever.  Flowers were not much this year.  School exhibits were better.
