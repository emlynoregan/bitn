Obituary & Inquest.  Kenneth Allen Gebhardt, second son of the late Frederick Gebhardt Sen. baker of Kooringa, died suddenly at the residence of his brother W.A. Gebhardt of Kooringa.

[Kenneth Allen Gebhardt, born 13 February 1867 and died 27 March 1904, was the son of Ferdinand Gebhardt.  William Alfred Gebhardt was his brother.]

He took ill on Sunday morning and died later the same day.  He had lived all his life in Burra and was aged 34.  For many years he had suffered from gout and other troubles.   Dr Sangster refused to issue a death certificate, having seen the deceased very little.

W.A. Gebhardt:

Deceased had been with me for three years.  Saw him Sunday midday when he seemed all right.  He said about 2.30 that his left arm had gone ‘dead’.  Rubbed his arm with liniment and gave him a drink.  Lit his pipe for him about 4.30 and about 4.40 he became unconscious.  Sent for my brother and later for the doctor.  There were several bottles in the room, but he did not have a drink after 2 o’clock.  Don’t know when he last drank wine.  Had lately suffered from pains in the head.  On Friday was struck in the eye by a piece of wood while chopping wood.

Dr Sangster Sen. said he was called at 6 p.m. and found the deceased unconscious and paralysed in the left arm and leg, with a wound on the left cheek below the eye.  Visited again at c. 8.45 p.m. when deceased was sinking and died soon after.  The wound could have been caused by a piece of wood, but the symptoms suggested a haemorrhage of the brain.

Frederick Gebhardt reported going home with the deceased on Saturday night and having a glass of wine from a half gallon flagon of the deceased.  Afterwards felt bad and blamed the wine.  He believed his brother had got the wine at Johnson’s.  Saw deceased on Sunday morning when he was vomiting.  He got up at midday and appeared very ill, but on seeing him at 2.30 when I went to mix dough he appeared all right.  Was sent for at 5.45 and when I arrived ‘Kenny’ was in a dying state.

Mrs C.M. Johnson of the Kooringa Hotel gave evidence of supplying 2½ bottled of Hardy’s dark and £ bottle of Yalumba light wine.

Eileen Johnson, daughter of Mrs C.M. Johnson, said the wine had not been supplied to the deceased, but to Mr F. Gebhardt, but when the latter vehemently denied this she said on being questioned again that she could not be sure which Mr Gebhardt it was, as they looked so alike.

John Henderson gave evidence of the wood-chopping accident.

The jury returned after consideration and asked for a post mortem and analysis of the wine.

On Tuesday the resumption of the inquest heard Dr Sangster report that death was due to brain haemorrhage unconnected with the blow from the wood.  It was probably hastened by over use of alcohol.  The deceased’s heart was enlarged and kidneys were diseased as well as the bowel.  There was no indication the wine was impure, but straining during vomiting might have hastened the rupture of a blood vessel in the brain.

The verdict was death due to brain haemorrhage accelerated by excessive drinking of wine.
