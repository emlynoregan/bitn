Letter from Pte L. Wahlert.  Apparently sent from near Benghazi where at the time it was cold and wet.  They are encamped in a former Italian air base.  He writes of seeing thousands of Italian prisoners of war marching out of Benghazi and also of being in Benghazi on leave the week before he wrote and of experiencing German air raids there.
