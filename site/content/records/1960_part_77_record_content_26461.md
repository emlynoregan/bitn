Burra Mine

The Burra Mine was inspected on Friday by Mr S. Bevan the minister of Mines, Mr T.A. Barnes the Director of Mines, the Deputy Director Mr Parkin and the Senior Geologist Mr Nixon.  The Minister said the Mines Department had been carrying out extensive geological, Geophysical and Geochemical surveys of the district for several years, coupled with a drilling program.  This had established substantial ‘leavings’ of oxidised copper in and north of the old open cut.  It is estimated to comprise over one million tons of low grade oxidised copper.  Trial recovery from parcels of the material by Australian Mineral Development Laboratories had been encouraging.  The interest of major exploration companies was being invited and if further work confirms the Mine Department’s findings an industry would be established at Burra to recover the copper.  This would involve open cut mining and the removal of overburden and oxidised copper to at least 100 ft below the present water level in the old open cut, followed by acid leaching of the ore to recover copper concentrate in a treatment plant.  Employment for over 50 men would last from 5 to 10 years.  Also several targets for deeper drilling had been suggested and any company selected for the project would be required to continue vigorous and substantial exploration, which if successful could lead to a major mining operation.  Mr Baulderstone and Mr Finch were very interested in the tour of inspection and appreciated the action of the Minister in including them and the Town & District Councils in the inspection.
