The Council can see some merits in bigger Councils in some cases and in boundary adjustments.  This Council was formed five years ago by the amalgamation of the DC and the Corporation of Burra.  Its income is about $100,000 p.a.  It employs a Clerk, Overseer, Part-Time Health and Building Inspectors and combines with two other Councils for a Full-Time Weeds Inspector.  There is a concern over rising costs of maintenance and administration and it feels its boundaries should not be retracted.  In the event of a decision that some adjacent Councils should cease to exist, a map is enclosed showing the area that could be incorporated into the Burra Burra DC.
