The ‘Midnight Oil House’ just north of Burra has been named one of the top two places to see in Australia by Australian Traveller Magazine.  Co-owner of the fragile stone home, Alex Stockman, said it was ‘a bit of a surprise’ that the house was so popular.  The house came to notice when it was used on a Midnight Oil Album Cover.  The original photograph was taken by Ken Duncan and became famous when used on the album Diesel and Dust.  [Photo]
