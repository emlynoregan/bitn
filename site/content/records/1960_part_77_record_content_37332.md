Within the last few days there has been nothing talked of but Port Phillip where gold has been found in immense quantities says the report.  A great many have left already with a great many more about to go.

I am carrying on business as before in General Store – my stock consists of Drapery, Grocery, Ironmongery, Glass and Earthenware etc.  I also have a Timber Yard and a banking [baking?] business here.  At my bakehouse I employ two men and a horse and cart to ??? the bread around town.  In my shop I have three shopmen besides myself and a clerk at the books.  I have another shop where I carry on business of the same kind as in Kooringa, where I keep two men, a draper and a grocer and am doing business in each place – except in timber.  There has not been much doing due to so many leaving for the gold diggings.  I sometimes get a whole cargo of timber consigned to me and my name has always been A1 since my arrival, or since I commenced business.

Benny Dunstan has returned from the gold diggings with about 30 others from this place and another of others since.  They say a great many there are doing well and hundreds not earning their salt and many who would return, but have not the means.  Pt Phillip is now all that is talked of and thousands are leaving this Colony for that place.  I expect they will be as much disappointed as those who went to Sydney.

Since the former part of this letter was written three of my hands have left me for the diggings.  In consequence I have sold my baking business, which I did not much care about, as the profit was not large and I find I have quite enough without it in my two shops.

I will write again in the course of a few days.  Mt respects to all my brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, cousins and enquiring friends.

You Most Dutiful Son,

Thomas Bath.
