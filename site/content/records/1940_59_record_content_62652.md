With the Government giving preference to Councils bituminising heavily used roads, the Burra Town Council is better placed to get and use a fair share of the Â£400,000.  Materials account for almost two thirds of the total cost for such roads and thus getting rid of a large grant is easier.  It is likely they will seek a grant to re-bituminise the road under the railway bridge and past the ballast quarry.
