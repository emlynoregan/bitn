An Anonymous Writer complains about the amount of dog excrement littering pavements in the shopping precinct.  This is a bad image for tourism and no one should have to watch where they put their feet.  Owners have a responsibility to collect excrement.  Wandering dogs are also a nuisance.  They should not be allowed out.
