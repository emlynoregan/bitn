Burra Cheer-up Society presented Lieut. N.H. McBride with an inscribed bugle on Tuesday 12 October.  Due to the short notice of his leaving an impromptu farewell was organised for him at 2 p.m.

During the week five of the Cheer-up girls assisted at the farewell dinner to 2,300 soldiers in Adelaide.

Farewell gifts were given to Ptes Foster, Lee and R. Wilson who were not here long enough for a social evening.

Â£50 worth of packed billycans has been sent off as Christmas gifts to troops.  E.J. Harris has sent a large crate of eggs to the Keswick Hospital.
