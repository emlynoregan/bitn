Kooringa News

The Bon Accord Company is working its property.  They are employing about 20 men.  Two new shafts are being opened, one called Jeffrey’s, after the Captain; the other Killicoat’s.  Water has come into the former and in the latter they are sinking through magnesian limestone.  There are also rumours that the English & Australian Copper Co. have struck a good lode on the Royal Mining Association’s property, and were raising ore worth £45 per ton.  Some of the shareholders here went down yesterday to visit it, and the result is that one of them has gone to Adelaide with samples for assay.

The Edouin family are expected this week and will perform in the large room at the Burra Hotel.
