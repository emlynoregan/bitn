Kooringa News, 27 March

The bazaar in aid of the proposed Redruth Anglican Church continued on Wednesday & Thursday.  The people continued to patronise it and be the end of Thursday the proceeds were upwards of £200.  It was then decoded to continue the sale on the following Monday & Tuesday.  As a result Sunday’s service was transferred to the Redruth Court House.  Remaining stock was auctioned on Tuesday night.

A group of serenaders gave performances at the Burra Hotel on Friday & Saturday, but in these dull times few people evidently felt like parting with their money.  The group performed at Aberdeen last night.

There has been no interest here in the general election.
