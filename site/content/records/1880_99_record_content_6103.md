Burra Institute, Annual Meeting of Subscribers was unusually largely attended on Tuesday.  Dr Brummitt presided.  The debt at 1 January was £419-17-9 and at the end of the year £381-2-11 despite expenditure of £150 on the property.  Entertainments and the Conversazione raised c. £60.  A substantial claim for grant-in-aid funds will substantially reduce this debt.  There are 107 subscribers, up 5 for the year.

Elected were: President, J.D. Cave; Vice President, T.W. Wilkinson; Treasurer, Mr Loutit; Secretary, F.W. Holder.
