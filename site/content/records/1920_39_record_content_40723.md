Burra Town Council, 18 January

The Fire Brigade Board advises that the year’s contribution would be £78-10-0.

The Town Clerk said the assessment had been lowered from £17,000 to £14,000 and the income from a 2/3 rate would be £1,861 with an estimated expenditure of £1,852.

The Mayor suggested a special meeting to consider the matter, but a motion by Cr Riggs that it be discussed at the next ordinary meeting was carried.
