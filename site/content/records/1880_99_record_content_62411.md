A Public Meeting called by the Mayor last Friday to decide on a form of public action to celebrate the Queen’s Jubilee decided on a treat for the children of the town on 22 June.  About £18 was collected at the Institute on Friday for that purpose.

The Bible Christian Sunday School Anniversary drew fair congregations.

Burra Jubilee Benevolent Society was formed at a meeting last Thursday with Dr Brummitt as President, Miss Coglin as Secretary and J.F. Moore as Treasurer.
