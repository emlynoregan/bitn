BCS Copper Toxicity

Following the deaths of several BCS animals samples were sent to the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science in Adelaide for analysis.  The normal copper level in the liver of a sheep is 0.5 to 9.4 units.  A merino ewe that died of pregnancy toxaemia had a reading of 15.1.  A merino hogget had one of 47.16.

The Romney Marsh ewe that died at the end of last term had a reading of 22.68.  Another recent case also returned a verdict of copper toxicity and a liver reading of 18.

Enquiries have been made to determine where all this copper is coming from.  The smelting works was in an adjacent paddock and much slag is scattered all over the locality and samples are often found in the Gully and Faraway Paddocks.  Also many paths in the area are made with mine tailings, which also contain small amounts of copper.  Testing is continuing and until these results are in we will not know which paddocks are a problem and which, if any, are safe.  Hopefully we will be able to devise some remedial strategy.
