Theft.  Mr A. McCulloch engaged a man named John Cushion to drive his pony and trap from Adelaide to Burra.  While having a drink with H.J. Riggs at Gawler he ‘nipped’ Riggs’ watch and chain.  The property was recovered at Burra and though Cushion claimed it was a joke, he was committed for trial on Thursday at Gawler and was allowed bail.
