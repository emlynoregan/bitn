Jessie Rooke was 100 on 30 September and celebrated with family and friends in Burra Uniting Church Hall.  Jessie grew up on the family farm near World’s End and walked two miles to the local school, where she studied with 25 other students to grade 7.  She then worked on the farm, enjoying riding her horse, mustering and drafting sheep.  She loved playing tennis at World’s End and dances at Robertstown and Point Pass – to the tunes on an accordion.

On 9 November 1932 she married Ted Rooke in the Kooringa Methodist Church.  She still keeps up with activities on the farm ‘Curburra’, which since Ted’s death in 1962 has been managed by Daphne and Peter Mengersen.  Jessie always enjoyed clearance sales and shearing time, when she would cook a roast and four veg.  She was always a most hospitable person and visitors always got a cup of tea and a welcome.  When her father had one of the few cars at World’s End she would drive people to the doctor or into the town, so it became known as the World’s End Taxi.  One of her greatest accomplishments was buying land from the Warnes, Woollacott and Villis families and seeing it paid off.  Some of the film Breaker Morant was shot on her property in 1979 and Jessie was an extra.  She said her century might be due to good clean living, no alcohol, dancing, friendship and hard work, but with a mother who lived to 90 and her father to well over that, it could have been in the genes.  [Born Jessie May Finch 30 September 1906, Kooringa: died 8 April 2008, Burra.  Actually her father lived to be 90 and her mother died aged 82.]
