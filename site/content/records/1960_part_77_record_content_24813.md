Two Escapees from Gladstone Gaol on Thursday tried to get to Victoria.  A De Soto car was stolen from Gulnare and found about 7 miles from the Cockrum homestead at Mt Bryan East.  Mr Cockrum’s Austin truck was stolen from an open shed on Thursday night.  Food and clothing was also taken.  The homestead of E.S. Wilks’ ‘Wallinga’ property was apparently entered in a search for food and clothing.  The men were arrested on Friday afternoon near Tutye on the Ouyen Highway and the missing truck was found nearby.
