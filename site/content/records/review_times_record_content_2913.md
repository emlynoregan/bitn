New Aged Housing for Burra

The six McBride stone cottages in Chapel Street may be redeveloped for aged housing in a joint venture between the Burra Burra DC and the Housing Trust.  The project has been submitted to the Housing Trust for costing and if successful work will be gin in May.  District Clerk Me R. Walsh said the cottages would be remodelled as one-bedroom units with new kitchens, bathrooms and laundries.  Each is currently built on two levels, but the proposal is to build up the back to make a one level unit that is more convenient for elderly people.  New Picket fences will be erected at the front and a colorbond fence at the rear.  Two of the existing tenants would remain and there are already applications from interested parties for the other four.  Rents will be means-tested.  If approved the Burra homes would become part of the SA Jubilee 150 Cottages for the Aged project.  The former Premier Mr Tonkin had set the Trust the goal of providing 1,000 homes for the aged by the end of the Jubilee year.  They would probably exceed it said co-ordinator of the Joint Venture section of the Housing Trust, Mr L. Rentis.  The majority of them had been built in the country.
