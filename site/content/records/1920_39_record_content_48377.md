M. Tiddy asked if ‘Johnny Green’ was to get any inscription.  The Mayor said he did not know of any.

Alfred Walker asked the Chairman’s permission to explain the origin of ‘Johnny Green’.

He said the figure was given by the late Sir Henry Ayers to commemorate what the discovery of the mine in 1845 had done to SA when the colony was in financial depression.  Ayers had had the figure made typical of the miner with pick in hand and had it erected on Morphett’s Shaft where it stayed till the unfortunate fire a few years ago.
