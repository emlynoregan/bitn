Cr Woollacott said that they had met the RSA and heard their views.  He didn’t recall anything being said about a written response and wondered what more information was wanted.

Cr Riggs thought the Council should present a scheme to the RSA rather than the reverse.

Cr Kellock moved the Council write to the RSA saying it was waiting for its scheme to be submitted as arranged.

The Mayor didn’t want a scheme; he wanted to know what financial assistance the Council could expect from the RSA.

Cr Harris objected to any scheme that closed the gap between the Memorial and the Rotunda.

Cr Allen suggested a scheme be submitted to the RSA.

Cr Kellock’s motion was carried.
