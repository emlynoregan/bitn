Accident/Obituary.  Robert Bruce Irlam aged 19 died when shot accidentally in the chest when a .22 automatic rifle accidentally discharged.  The accident occurred five miles north of Redbanks about 9.30 p.m. on Tuesday night.  The deceased, a son of Mr & Mrs Stan Irlam presently of Terowie, had been spotlighting with Trevor Menz and Brian Kakoschke.  He was driving with the rifle leaning against his left leg with the butt on the floor.  He managed to almost stop the car and his companions placed him on the back seat and got him to the Burra Hospital at about 10 p.m. where Dr Miller pronounced him dead.
