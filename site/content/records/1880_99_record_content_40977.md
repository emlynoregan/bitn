Obituary.  Mr G.F. McLagan [Should be G.R.] was the son of Dr McLagan of Perth, Scotland, but was born in Jamaica where his grandfather was a wealthy planter and slave owner, leaving at death an estate of £260,000.  He was also related to Dr McLagan, Bishop of Lichfield.  Trained as an architect, Mr McLagan followed his profession in Melbourne, retiring with some £8,000, but this was subsequently lost in sheep farming in Victoria on the Murray River.  Here he had an accident which crippled him for life.  He came to Burra about 12 years ago.  Rev. H. Howitt saw a photograph of a beautiful church he had designed at Warnambool and asked him to draw the plans for St Mary’s.  When they were accepted he came to Burra to superintend the building of the erection in 1879.  He also planned and superintended the building of the handsome home of Mr Hiles of Catarpoo.  He was 71 and leaves a widow and one son.
