Court.

Agnes Gully was charged by M-C Jemison with abusive language in a public place.  She appeared well dressed and with her mother who asked for an adjournment because she had witnesses to prove the girl’s innocence, but M-C Jemison had said that if she kept Agnes at home for a week he would not proceed with the case.  She had only been notified the night before that the case would be called.  The court decided to proceed.

Richard Joseph Jemison said he had asked her to move on when obstructing the footpath in Kooringa talking to people.  She had then returned and he told her he had had enough of her obstructing the footpath.  She went off the footpath and said: ‘You’ll have to stretch your b____ fat legs.’

Agnes accused Jemison of continually dogging her in the street and contradicted other details of Jemison’s testimony.  She said she could get witnesses to support her side.

The case was then adjourned for a week.
