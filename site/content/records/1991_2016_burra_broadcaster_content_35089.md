New Zealand Television’s ‘Miss Popularity’ Series is being shot in Burra.

Ten New Zealand beauties are in town to compete for the prize in this reality TV series.  There will also be cash prizes for locals totalling $50,000.

On Saturday they were up at 4 a.m. to leave Adelaide for a photo shoot at the Midnight Oil House.  Then the crew departed and the girls were left alone until Graham Radford and his horsemen rode over the hill and told them to jump on.  The reassembled crew then told them this was no photo shoot, but a reality TV show in which they would be faced with a series of challenges in the coming days.

At the Burra Creek Gorge they found a platform by a swimming hole and a cage with a small crocodile.  They were told it had been captured there earlier.  Their job was to cross the pool on a swinging rope.

Back in town they were assembled at the top of Kangaroo St before making a grand entrance to Market Square to be greeted by an excited crowd of locals.  They were then told they would be billeted with local families for the duration of the show.  On Monday there was cattle droving and bull dogging and yesterday saw a tractor race at BCS.  Last night the first of the girls was voted off by locals assembled at Morphett’s Enginehouse.  A girl will be voted off every second day until only ‘Miss Popularity’ remains.  [5 coloured photos]
