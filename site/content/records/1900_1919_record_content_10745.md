Obituary.  Mr Luke Teddy died at Broken Hill on Wednesday at the residence of his daughter Mrs J. Thomas.  He came to SA 54 years ago aged 20.  He worked in the Burra Mine for some time before going like so many to the Victorian goldfields.  He returned to the Burra Mine before leaving to engage in farming.  About 20 years ago with failing health he sold the farm at Baldina and retired to Redruth and only recently went to Broken Hill.  As a young man he was a noted pugilist and much of his later physical affliction was due to that.  About 30 years ago he became noted for the sincerity and zeal of his religious life.  He could neither read nor write, but despite that he had a thorough knowledge of scripture and became a power for good in the community.  He was a prominent member of the Methodist Church and a frequent visitor to the sick and dying.  For the last 15 years he was totally blind.  He suffered greatly due to the loss of his wife six years ago, since when his health and spirits had rapidly declined.  He died aged 74 leaving two sons and three daughters.  He was buried in Broken Hill and a memorial service was held at Redruth Methodist Church on Sunday.
