Burra High School

Valmai Williams has won the A.B. Riggs prize for most marks in the Intermediate Exam.

Yesterday the school went to Adelaide by train to visit the Adelaide Exhibition at Wayville.  About 75 students were in the party.

The Poliomyelitis Mobile Unit will visit the school in the next few weeks to give the first injections to all children under the age of 15 years.
