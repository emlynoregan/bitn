The Old Burra Road

Mr Neales moved for a sum not exceeding £2,000 for repairing the Tothill’s Creek-Burra Road.  He said it was still largely used.

The Treasurer said the Government could not support such a request.

Mr McCulloch said there was not a more wretched piece of road anywhere.  In October 1863 no less than 40 drays, for the most part loaded with wool had bee stopped for nine days on account of its bad condition.

Mr Coglin & Hon. W. Milne spoke in support.

Mr Bright said the reason for the condition was the large traffic by the Copper Company’s drays.  He thought the people in the district needed to form one or two District Councils and that would be the way to attend to the road, the main line of road now having been shifted.  The vote was lost 16 to 6.
