Burra Town Council Meeting, 12 September.

As soon as the meeting opened Cr Parks moved to have the room cleared of strangers.

Cr Linkson objected saying the move was illegal because in compliance with section 71 of by-law 1 the adjournment at the last two meetings had not specified a date and time for the meeting.  The standing orders do not provide for an adjourned meeting taking place except at the date and time of the ordinary meeting.

Excitement followed.

The Mayor ignored the objection and put the motion of Cr Parks, using his casting vote to get it carried.

Cr Linkson pointed out that the casting vote was unnecessary as not all the Councillors had voted.

When strangers were asked to leave no one moved.  At length he asked ex-Councillor Sampson to retire and the latter respectfully asked him to define ‘strangers’. 

Mr Sampson refused to leave when the Mayor refused to discuss the matter.

The mayor then called upon P-C Thomas to come and remove Mr W.J. Davey from the Chamber as a trespasser, as he was bringing Council business to a standstill.

Cr Linkson then tried to get his objections minuted, but failed (twice).

The police arrived after some 15 minutes.

Cr Linkson asked if the Overseer and Inspector were strangers.

The Mayor said they were officers of the Council.

The constable then removed the editor of The Record.

From the door the editor heard Cr Linkson try again to have his objection recorded.

The Mayor then saw the editor and others by the door taking notes and ordered the Inspector to close it which was done with some difficulty.

By this time ratepayers and non-ratepayers had taken up positions on forms and boxes to get a glimpse inside the Chamber.  After a few minutes Crs Walsh, West and Linkson came out, having refused to sit in a closed Council.

The ratepayers decided to call a ratepayers’ meeting and subsequently a large deputation led by Mr J. Sampson called upon the Mayor to call such a meeting and the Mayor said he would attend to the matter.

The mayor and three Councillors then transacted some business as a growing crowd gathered outside.

Legal proceedings are to be instituted against one or two for the illegal ejection of ratepayers and in respect to the letter sent to the police – it being noted that the pre-prepared letter giving the reason for calling the police stated that Mr W.J. Davey was the obstructing person when in fact it was Mr Sampson who had been specifically asked to move.
