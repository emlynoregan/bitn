Mr Lance Lewis’s social last Wednesday at the Burra Hotel is reported.  He is off on a business & pleasure trip through Qld, NT & NSW.  Dr Sangster jun. presided and there was a full representation of the Burra Automobile Club, Football Club, and Burra Musical & Dramatic Club & Racing Club.  Mr Gilbert Lewis will remain in Burra for some time at least.  The trip will allow him to see cattle and sheep across Australia and to gain a greater insight into the pastoral industry and the way stock is dealt with, which will be of value to the firm.  [Bagot, Shakes & Lewis]  The report extends for over 2 columns.
