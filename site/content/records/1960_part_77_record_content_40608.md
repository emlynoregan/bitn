Weather.  In the past week rains came in from the east with falls of up to 150 points in the pastoral areas.  Run-off was generated.  Germination of grasses and rapid growth has followed.  Rains continue to hamper sewing in the agricultural areas.  Crops already sown continue to prosper.  Dust Hole Creek flooded on Friday after 154 points in the area.  It is now running with clear water from seepage, a thing Me Les Thomas says he has not seen for some 40 years.
