Burra Town Council, 28 February

Mr Lewis, Councilâ€™s representative on the Fire Brigade Board, said the foreman had done the right thing in not attending the fire recently.  The correct step would have been to sound the alarm a second time when the fire crossed the Council boundary.

The District Council will take no action over a crossing south of the Burra Station.

The District Council will keep the Town Council informed over any Freezing Works development.
