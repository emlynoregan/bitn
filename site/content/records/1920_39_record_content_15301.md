The President thought a man needed to be placed in charge of collecting exhibits to prevent theft.

Mr Radford and the secretary were appointed as Show Society representatives for the ‘Back to Burra Week’.  The President suggested a souvenir containing the history of the Society be printed.  This was adopted.

Back to Burra.  The meeting on Wednesday was attended by 60-70 ladies and gentlemen and it was decided to go ahead.  The Mayor had hoped for a bigger turn-out.  He said show week had been suggested and after some discussion F.T. Sara so moved, Mr Radford seconded and it was carried unanimously.

A committee was then appointed.  Miss Bubb suggested special invitations be sent to old Burraites who had attained distinction.  A temporary smaller committee was then elected to draw up a scheme: the Mayor, Messrs Radford, Riggs, Penrose, F. Sara, Morton, Crewes and Miss Bubb and the Mayoress.

Booborowie Church of England Bazaar on 24 February raised c. £80.
