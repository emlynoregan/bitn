The Saddleworth Comedy Co. performed on 31 December to a very thin house, people preferring the outside activities.  The churches held the usual watch-night services.  At midnight guns were fired, whistles blown at the foundry and all possible noise made.  Larrikinism was conspicuous by its absence.
