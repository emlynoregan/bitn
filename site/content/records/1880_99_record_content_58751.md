The editor applauds the election of new councillors, which will break up the clique that had made the old council so notorious.  He goes on the say that the ‘impartiality which predominated and characterised the whole business last year will be entirely abandoned, and the needs of ratepayers, whether they are friends or foes of councillors, will not be overlooked, but will receive that consideration which they are justly entitled to.’

[Presumably the writer meant to use ‘partiality’ where he used ‘impartiality’.]

The books clearly refute the statement made recently at Redruth by Cr Rabbich, which appears to have been merely aimed at influencing the election, and to prejudice Mr Cave’s chances of election.
