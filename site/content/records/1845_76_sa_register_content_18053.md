Kooringa News, 10 December

Fire.  Thursday 8 December will long be remembered for there was a strong hot wind and the atmosphere was darkened by clouds of dust and smoke, the latter from a large bushfire raging on adjoining stations.  It is said to have begun at Mannanarie and travelled very rapidly southwards, at one place timed at 9 miles in 45 minutes.  Overseers are at a loss of what to do with their sheep.

Cudmore’s Run (Yongala) is totally burned and has no feed and so too is Canowie, where stables and haystack at the head station were destroyed.  Several houses and an imported bull died and sheep losses are an unconfirmed 3,000.

Chewing’s & McCulloch’s runs are badly affected, but there is no detail available yet.

Mt Bryan run is nearly all burnt and about 300 sheep killed.  The head station was saved with difficulty.

Vickery’s is burnt out with no feed escaping.

Booborowie run is two thirds burnt and the head station saved only with great exertion.

There are as yet unconfirmed reports of several people lost and shepherds burnt.  Mr Armstrong of Booborowie sent for help to Mr H. Dawson in Kooringa and 20 to 30 men went out to assist.  They would have achieved little had not the wind changed at 7 o’clock.  At one time the front was over 20 miles wide.  It would have spread even further had not the burnt ground from previous fire prevented it.
