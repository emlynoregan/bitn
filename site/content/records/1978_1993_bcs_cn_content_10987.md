Burra Apex Club

The club will cease to exist from 30 June after many years of successful service.  After growing from a small beginning, it grew to become one of the larger country clubs, but has now reverted to a small under-active club in which many members are getting towards the age limit for Apex.  It is not living up to its charted and unless there is an immediate influx of members in the 18-40 years age group, the club will close at the end of June.  Steve Woolley, President.
