Burra Bowling Club held its AGM on 5 July with C.L. Phillips in the chair.

Elected: Patron, D. Jacka; President, C.L. Phillips; Vice-Presidents, M. Stockman & C. Dare; Secretary, D. Field continues pro tem and Treasurer, H. Crump.

The club resolved to forward to the MNBA a notice of motion seeking the Association be divided into a First and Second Division and that the Association lay down conditions of play for the Champion of Champion rinks and singles events.  Congratulations were extended to Stan Woollacott for winning the veteransâ€™ event, which had not been finalised on closing day.  The President reported that most clubs seemed dissatisfied with the arrangements for a minor round with play-offs through semi-finals, finals and a grand-final for the pennant competition and changes are desirable for the 1967-68 season.  Burra Blue reached the semi-finals.  The greens were first class this year, especially later in the season.  Thanks go to Dudley Jacka for this and to Charlie Dare for looking after watering, assisted by Joe Lloyd and also to Joe Lloyd, Bill Corner and Merv Burt for cutting and rolling.  Club tournaments seem to start too late and this causes a rush to finish them before the season closes.  An earlier start seems desirable.  Valued members who have left the district are Alex Ford and Milton Mitchell and Bill Teague is also moving on.
