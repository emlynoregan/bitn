Obituary.  William Herbert Collins aged 62, a farmer of Booborowie, died at the Burra Hospital on Thursday from terrible injuries inflicted on him on Tuesday morning by a Jersey bull.  The animal attacked him when he went to tie it up, trampling and butting him.  Mr Collinsâ€™s 22-year-old son, Ross, chased off the bull and dragged his father clear.  Mr Collins suffered four broken ribs, a broken hip, broken pelvis and concussion.  He was a returned man from WWI and a highly respected gentleman in the district.  Seventy cars followed the hearse to the Booborowie Cemetery.
