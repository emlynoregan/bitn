James Reed of Wandillah writes thanking the Scouts for the ‘beautiful swastika medal presented to me at their first Annual Social held at Jubilee Hall on Thursday night in return for use of rooms at the White Hart.’

The Mayor pointed out he did not see why the troop should not have a room of their own.  I think if an appeal were made there would be a ready response.  I would be only too pleased to help such a move.  Mr Reed enclosed £3-3-0 to help the work of the troop.
