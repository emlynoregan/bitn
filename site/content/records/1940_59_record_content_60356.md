Burra Town Council, 3 August

Permission was granted for the RSL to plant 30 trees on the eastern approach to the town.

Information is to be sought from the Adelaide City Council about correct parking angles and distances between cars etc.

Numerous complaints have been received by Councillors concerning the blowing down of locomotive boilers in the railway yard and the unnecessary ringing of the Bon Accord gong.

[Presumably activated by shunting operations that did not actually cross the road.]

SAR Commissionerâ€™s attention will be drawn to the above.

Straying sheep are causing concern in the town.
