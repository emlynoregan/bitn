A Drug & Alcohol Forum was held at the Burra Sports Complex last Wednesday night as a combined school and community event.  Sgt Amanda Molinaro from Pt Pirie Drug Action Team was the speaker.  She gave advice on drug offences and what happens after the drugs are found and gave hints on running a safe party.  The forum was an initiative of Watch SA and BCS.
