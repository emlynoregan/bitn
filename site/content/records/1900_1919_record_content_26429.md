The London Bio-Tableaux.  This small company visited Burra last Wednesday evening and showed to a fair house.  The pictures were very good, unusual and intensely amusing.  Fred C. Cleves made his mark as a comedian and there was bell-ringing and an interesting exhibition of model flying machines which were flown about the hall.
