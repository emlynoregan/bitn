Methodist Rendezvous between members of Burra Methodist Circuit and the Hope Valley & Tea Tree Gully Churches took place last weekend.  Redruth Hall was filled for the rally on Saturday night, led by Graham Hore, with Rev. Horrie Dunkin as speaker.  Visitors were billeted in district homes and took part in services at Farrell Flat and Mt Bryan and in a study group at Booborowie as well as in a service at Burra.

World’s End Methodist Church services have had to be cancelled for the time being.
