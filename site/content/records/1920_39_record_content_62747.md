Mongolata Goldfield

Mr W. Wiltshire was trying to extract ore at the open cut with a hammer and gad, being unable to obtain fracture when, on Tuesday 18 August, he was partially buried in a fall of some tons of earth.  He lay there unconscious for about two hours when Mr Fayer, who happened to be setting traps in the area, chanced to look into the mine.  He found Mr Wiltshire in a shocking condition.  His face was covered with dirt and blood from severe cuts on his head, his teeth were knocked out and those remaining had later to be removed.  He was assisted to W. Carpenter’s Boarding House by Messrs Riley, Reedy and Fayer and first aid was administered.  He was later taken to Burra Hospital and attended to by Dr Steele.  He is making a satisfactory recovery.

We note that trapping is needed because for over three months now the men at Mongolata have had their extra allowance of 7 lb of meat a fortnight cut off.

Things on the field are generally very quiet.  Byles’ Mine is waiting for new machinery and is employing only seven men at present.

The battery is kept going with parcels from other claims and at present is crushing from the Baldina Co.’s claim.

After about 4½ years’ work Mr Rolph Anderson and W. Trew are on good prospects, working on a claim about four miles north of Byles’.

Mr H.F. Seaton left Mongolata last week after three years there.  He has obtained a position in Adelaide.  He will be missed as President of the Sports Club and at Tennis etc.

The Sports Club has decided to postpone its usual October Sports in hopes of a bigger meeting later.

New arrivals, Mr & Mrs Ton Pexton and children are expected to take up residence soon in their newly erected home.
