Burra Town Council.

The rate subsidy for 1897 of £94-13-1 has been credited to the Council at the Bank of Australasia.

J. Jenkin’s tender for a culvert at the junction of Ayers and George Sts was accepted.

The United Friendly Societies’ Sports Committee wanted £60 spent on improvements to Victoria Park. The Council voted to spend £10 if the UFSSC spend £10.
