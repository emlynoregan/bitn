BCS Speech Night was held last Thursday, 12 December.

The Barry Wakelin School & Community Award was presented to Rod Peppiatt for his help to the school over many years in his capacity as chaplain and in many different areas of the school’s life and activities.

Gus Wenzel outlined Kevin Fahey’s contribution to BCS over the past ten years.  A farewell was also given to Joan Reed and Tess Hopkins.  Joan has worked at many levels of the school and Tess has been teacher/librarian at Burra Community Library since 1974.

[The prize and award winners are listed with 8 photos.]
