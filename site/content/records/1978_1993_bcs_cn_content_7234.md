Burra-Broken Hill Wheelbarrow Push

On Wednesday 26 January 24 wheelbarrow pushing teams from all over Australia were flagged off from Market Square on a race to Broken Hill by Olympic runner Herb Elliot.  A large crowd had assembled to see the start.  All teams completed the race and the winners were the Dampier Saltshakers Team from WA.  Broken Hill’s Day Dream Motel Team came second.  As part of the event the Burra Yacht Club organised a night of fun at the creek with tugs-of-war, pillow fights and food stalls.  Burra received a lot of publicity from the event, which was completed without serious injury.
