Ski For Life is an event that will involve a combined 500 km water ski from Renmark to Murray Bridge.  The sponsored run will raise money for increasing awareness in the community of depression and suicide.  Local Burra man Bill Stockman is one of the main drivers behind the event.  As Chairman of Menâ€™s Watch he has taken a strong interest in mental health.  He also has a personal connection with the program, having suffered depression off and on since childhood, after he was involved in a shooting accident that took the life of his friend aged 14.  After the breakdown of his marriage several years ago he was isolated and living alone and attempted suicide.  After this event and being hospitalised for a period he took an interest in the program to raise awareness of the problem of suicide, especially as it related to men, who account for some 78% of suicide deaths in Australia.  There is a special problem in rural communities due to isolation and lack of mental health service.  [Photo]
