The Burra Railway

On 30 April the newly elected members for Burra Messrs Neales and Boucaut waited on the Commissioner of Public Works and presented two memorials to him.  One urged the creation of much needed employment by the immediate commencement of the Forresters-Redruth Railway, with work at the Burra end.

The other was signed by tradespeople of Kooringa and the neighbourhood and vouched for the validity of the plight of the 54 unemployed (and 23 soon to be unemployed) who had signed the first memorial.

The members spoke in support of the memorialists.  The Commissioner said no time would be lost in completing arrangements to carry out the promise he had previously made in favour of commencing the line at both ends.  He hoped everything would be ready to let contracts at the beginning of June, but a more formal answer would be forwarded next Monday.
