The annual meeting of the Burra Auxiliary Branch of the British & Foreign Bible Society took place on Monday night in the Bible Christian Chapel.  Even though it was the roughest night of the season the large chapel was half full.  The financial statement showed a decided improvement on previous years and so it was resolved to send a free contribution of £200 to the parent society.  Rev. Dr Tucker was the deputation from the society and on Sunday he preached two very able sermons on behalf of the society at St Mary’s Church.
