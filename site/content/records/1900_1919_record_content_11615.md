Mouse numbers are high at present.  The other afternoon a group of farmersâ€™ sons quickly bagged over 4,000 in the hills near town.  Any bush is likely to have 20-30 under it.  Young crops are being attacked and in places earlier in the season they consumed much seed so that some farmers had to sow a second time.
