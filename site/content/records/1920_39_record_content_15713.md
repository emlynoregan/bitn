Advt.  Tenders are called for cementing the inside of the north and west walls to eight feet and bolting the porch to the church and making the same watertight and concrete set-off on the outside of the west wall of the Old Church, Mt Bryan.  [Presumably the old Bible Christian Church north of the town on the way to Mt Bryan East.]
