Burra RSL Ball was held at the Burra Town Hall on 12 August, preceded by a pre-ball party at the RSL Hall hosted by Vice-President Mr E.C. Pietsch and Mrs Pietsch due to the ill health of President Mr G.J. Kelly and Mrs Kelly.  Bad weather and appalling road conditions deterred some from attending.
