Bon Accord Mine Site

Burra National Trust has hired Mr David Bannear of Saddleworth to undertake archaeological work at the Bon Accord site.  The aim is to fill in some gaps in knowledge about the site. While there is not much about the Bon Accord Mine in Australian mining journals, Mr Greg Drew of the SA Department of Mines & Energy has found considerable information in the London mining journals.  The proposed dig may uncover the lost foundations of the engine-house and draught chimney.  $1,000 has been allocated for further research and digging.
