Burra Lutheran Church will be dedicated on 5 November.  It was transported on 18 August from Mansfield Park and has since been renovated and refitted.  There will be a special service at 2.30 p.m. conducted by Rev. G.O. Minge, President of the Lutheran Church of Australia, SA District, assisted by Rev. A.E. Thiele of Saddleworth, a former Pastor of the Burra Congregation and Rev. A.H. Schmidt, the present pastor.  Members have spent many hours setting up the church.  The porch had been removed for transportation and was rebuilt.  The whole building was repainted.  Fittings for the interior have come from other congregations.

The Clare Congregation presented furniture for the sanctuary, of the altar, pulpit, font and an organ.

The Blyth Congregation provided the sanctuary carpet, the aisle runner and the notice board.

Both these congregations are in the same parish as Burra.

The Palmer Congregation gave the pews.  These were old and had to be shortened, but are quite comfortable. Seating is provided for more than 80 people.

Robertstown Church donated a fine set of paraments [robes] in the five different colours and a clergy chair.

The history of the Lutheran Church in Burra goes back to 1847 when the mining company brought out a group of smelters from the Hanz mountains [sic: for Harz] in Germany.  These and other Germans, who hoped to make their fortunes in copper mining, formed a congregation in 1851 and built [actually began to build] a church near the courthouse.  Many of them left, however, in 1852 for the Victorian gold rush.  A struggling congregation remained for a number of years.  Later the church was rented to a Lodge and was destroyed by fire after one of their meetings on 20 July 1910.  [This is an inadequate and misleading summary of the history of the building, which was actually completed only in 1861.  It continued to have Lutheran services from visiting pastors as well as being used as the Wesleyan Sunday school for over twenty years, by the Aberdeen Oddfellows’ Lodge and as a general meeting place.]  The records show that from 1905 Lutherans living in Burra were served by different pastors.  Services were generally conducted in homes of members of the congregation and alternated between Booborowie and Mt Bryan.  Later services were commenced at Flagstaff.  In 1939 services were conducted at Burra when the congregation rented the old Copperhouse Methodist Church.  [Actually the Westbury Methodist Church.]  Then at the end of 1940 it moved to the old Westbury Church in Burra, where it worshipped till the building became unsafe.  [This is incorrect.  The church used in Burra North was Jubilee Hall, the former Primitive Methodist Chapel and later the Methodist Sunday school.  But the dates are also incorrect.]  The congregation then transferred to St Mary’s [Anglican] Parish Hall where the last service was held on 22 October.  The present minister is Pastor A.H. Schmidt who lives at Blyth.  It is planned to hold services fortnightly with lay readers on alternate weeks.  Chairman of the Congregation is Mr Edgar Pietsch and the secretary/Treasurer is Rupert Kleinig.

[A photograph of the church before it was moved from Mansfield Park is printed.]

[This account is rather inaccurate.  After the 1910 fire the places for services were:

1911-1921	Jubilee Hall, Burra North, formerly the Primitive Methodist Zion Chapel.

1922-27	At private homes at Mt Bryan & Booborowie

1927-34	At private homes at Mt Bryan & Flagstaff

1934-39	At a private home at Flagstaff

1939	From August 1939 to 1947 at the former Westbury Methodist Church (adjacent to Copperhouse).  The church actually in Copperhouse was a Primitive Methodist Church, which had become the Copperhouse School.
