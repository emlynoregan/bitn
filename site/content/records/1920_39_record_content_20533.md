Market Square

On 25 August the RSA met with the Council to present an alternative plan for Market Square.  Dr Steele said that reports in the Record made the RSA realise that its preferred option of enclosing the Rotunda and Memorial in one fence was not going to be realised.  It seemed to Dr Steele (who had discussed it with his brethren) that the whole thing deserved serious consideration and should not be determined merely by cost.  The enclosure needed to be in keeping with the memorials and to set them off.  Whatever was done would be practically for all time and deserved further consideration.  He suggested to the RSA branch that there be a triangular enclosure of both the Rotunda and the Memorial with a base 26yds long in front of the troughs and the sides 60yds long finishing in an apex pointing to the Institute and that the enclosure be a low stone wall topped with an iron railing.  He had costed the wall at £75 and posts, piping etc. would bring the total to £380.  He thought the right way to go was to get proper plans drawn up and put to tender and if people did not respond and come forward with money the Council would have done its job and the RSA as much as it could do to perpetuate worthily the memory of the fallen.

Cr Riggs wanted the matter discussed fully.  He thought iron fencing was out of date.  He did not see why the soldiers wanted to take the Rotunda into consideration.  If in future it was desirable to do so with his scheme it was merely a matter of removing a few posts.  His scheme would require less upkeep.  He thought only round posts would suit the memorial.  He was against a wall and iron fence.

Dr Steele was not fixed about the type of fence, but was sure the area needed a triangular enclosure to be artistically in tune with Market Square, which was triangular rather than square.  With labour this latest RSA scheme would cost probably more like £450 and concrete post structures about £250.

Mr Hammond said the RSA wasn’t demanding anything.  It simply wanted to see the town beautified and he felt leaving out the Rotunda would spoil it.  He would be happy with Cr Riggs’ fence for the triangular plan and thought the road on the Farmers’ Union side should then be made one way.

Cr Kellaway favoured the triangular idea.  A square fence with a round one beyond it [for the Rotunda] would not be in keeping with modern planning.

The Mayor was not optimistic about raising the money by subscription.  The Honour Roll Committee could not collect all the promises and £70 was still outstanding.  He thought now perhaps a public meeting would be best.  Dr Steele supported the public meeting idea.
