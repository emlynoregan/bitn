The late Mrs Josiah Thomas has left the Burra Hospital a bequest of £286.  The Chairman of the Board says it will go towards building the proposed new nurses’ quarters.

[I have not been quickly able to trace who this was.  There doesn’t seem to be any wife of Josiah Thomas who died about this time.  A Miss Mary Hannah Thomas died 3 November 1945 aged 78, so could the paper be confused?]
