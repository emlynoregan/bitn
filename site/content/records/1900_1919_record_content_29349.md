Burra Literary Society.  A meeting of ladies and gentlemen was held at the Institute on Wednesday to attempt to resuscitate the society.  There was a small credit balance from the old society and the Institute could provide a room with lights.  The rules of the old society were adopted and subscriptions fixed at 1/- a quarter.  Elected were President, J. McLaren; Vice-Presidents, Messrs Winnall, Fuss & H. Roach.  [Personal interest: probably C. Fuss.]
