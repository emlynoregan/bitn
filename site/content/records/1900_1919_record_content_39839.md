Fire Bug.  The 5th attack occurred on Monday.  About 12.30 a.m. Monday morning Mrs Lord heard a noise and told her husband she thought someone was stealing chaff from their sheds.  While investigating Mr Lord saw flames and smoke coming from the rear of Walker & Sons and found a crate of crockery packed in straw burning quite fiercely.  He contacted M-C Queale and also wakened Mr A. Walker who put out the fire with a patent fire extinguisher.

A blacktracker arrived on the Monday train.  A man with a limp in his right leg was tracked to the National Bank and thence to Paxton Square and then to a house towards the cemetery.  Investigation continues.  The damage was c. £16 and a reward of £25 is offered.
