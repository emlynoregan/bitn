Burra Show, Wednesday 25 October.

[The introduction to the report cites 1897 as the date of the 1st show, but it was actually 12 September 1877 and they were held annually to 1885 and then not til 1894.]

The weather was perfect and taking were a record £99-6-9, up from £96-12-6 the previous year.  With more than double the number of members the crowd was conservatively said to number 2,000.  Livestock entries were good.  Dairy produce was good in butter, eggs, ham and bacon.  Poultry was magnificent with 256 entries.  Draft horses were very good, but bloodstock was poor with only three entries in four classes.  The ring show was excellent. (Ladies now-a-days ride astride.)  The Gawler team won the Section Fours.  The 29 entries for cattle were a record.  The dog show was good as were vegetables and flowers with over 105 entries – if not quite as good as last year.  The President, I.J. Warnes, entertained for lunch the Patron of the Society, Hon. J. Lewis MLC, the President of the Clare Society and the Secretary of the Petersburg Society.
