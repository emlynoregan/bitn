The Burra Institute Committee Grand Concert to launch the new grand piano and collect funds for it drew only about half a hall of patrons.  Music lovers turned up, but the social fraternity were absent, though they will be the ones to benefit from it for dance music.

[The concert is reviewed in an article about 1 column in length.]
