The Mayor as JP.  The mayor of a country town becomes a JP by virtue of his office, but does not retain the position once he leaves office.  Members of the Burra Council feel that if the position is held for three or more years that person should be appointed a permanent JP.  An approach will be made to the District Member to recommend this to the Chief Secretary.

The Bon Accord Bridge was damaged on Monday when a car belonging to Mr Mitchell of Broken Hill knocked off three cement posts holding up the guard rail.  No one was injured in the accident.

Burra Air Force Assoc. has donated £250 to the Burra hospital to be used exclusively for building and equipping the Men’s Bathroom.

The Kooringa Swing Bridge.  Children and others are still riding their bicycles over this despite notices forbidding it.  The notices will be renewed.

The Kingston St Bridge is also causing concern.  Cyclists approaching its eastern end from the school are not easily seen by motorists travelling east.  The school’s co-operation will be sought and Cr Baulderstone moved that ‘School’ signs be placed at the approach near the RSL corner to slow traffic to 15 m.p.h. over the bridge.

Drew Lane.  The Town Council will ask the police to approve a ‘Stop’ sign at the south end of Drew Lane.

Accident.  Another car has overturned on the Adelaide Road near ‘The Gap.’  A party of surveyors in an Austin utility were the latest victims yesterday.  The party continued in the badly dented vehicle after the accident.

Goats have been culled recently on Balah Station by Messrs Jack & Alf Rowe.  One ‘Old Billy’ had a 40 inch span between the tips of its horns.

The late C.W. Gare has bequeathed £100 to the Burra Hospital.

Adelaide-Burra Cycle Race.  J. Conyers was first and fastest in 5 hours 51 minutes 2.2 seconds.  He is aged 41 and his win is notable in that he fell early, injuring several ribs and had chain troubles towards the end, having to replace it six times in the last few miles.  On the outskirts of Burra he was 50 yards behind, but gained the lead just 200 yards from the finish.  The trophy was presented at the dance in the RSL Hall in the evening, by the Mayor Mr W. Carpenter.  The prize money is a small £25.  The Adelaide-Pt Pirie race has £160 in prize money of which £50 is first prize.
