CAFHS (Formerly M & BHA)

In March 1983 an open meeting considered moving the Burra Clinic to another venue.  At this meeting the general attitudes of past and present members was to maintain the present building.  Since then the clinic users have given very little support to enable us to be financially viable.  With this in mind at the next meeting on 14 May the committee hopes to pass a motion notifying Headquarters of our plight and suggesting they take over the running of the clinic at a venue of their choice.
