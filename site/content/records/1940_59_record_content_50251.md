Other reminiscences brought to mind by Rev. E.H. Woollacott, Mr Dunhill and Mr Guy Tiddy.

Wednesday.  Redruth Sunday School was beautifully decorated for a musical luncheon at which about 160 sat down to a knife and fork meal.  Rev. C. Christopher welcomed everyone.  Visiting clergy gave their greetings: Rev. C.L.H. Pitman of Gladstone and previously of Redruth, Rev. R.S.T. Pettet of St Mary’s, Captain Lawrence of Burra Salvation Army, Rev. J.C. Jennison, a former Redruth Minister and Rev. F.E. Tregilgas of Kooringa.  Other Guilds and Churches sent greetings.

Mrs Satchell sang There’s an Old-Fashioned House, after which there were contributions from Hilltown Ladies, Miss Barbara Humphrys of Ironmine and Miss Jefferies of Mt Bryan.  Rev. E. Nicholls of Hallett gave an address.

Thursday.  Celebrations ended with a thanksgiving service with a fine congregation.  A former minister, Rev. C.L.H. Pitman occupied the pulpit with Rev. Christopher.  The choir again gave excellent service and the evening concluded with a pasty supper.
