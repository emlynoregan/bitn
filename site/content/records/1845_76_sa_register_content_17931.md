Kooringa News, 17 November

The Prince of Wales’ birthday was kept up with the usual festivities, including cricket matches.

Business is dull.  Messrs Drew & Co. have managed to get the greater part of the wool carriage into their hands.

Numbers of sheep are passing through by the Baldina Run for Victoria; as many as 90,000 are said to have been bought by Mr Rochfort and others.

A young man has been committed for trial at the Supreme Court for stealing a vice.  This sort of offence is a rarity here.

The exodus to Wallaroo continues.

The Mine continues the same, but the Smelting Works are almost out and will be completely so by the year’s end.

The constructors have now obtained timber for the piles of the Redruth Ford and the work is good and sound.
