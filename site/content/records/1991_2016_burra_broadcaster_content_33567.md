Fire.  A truck that was refuelling caught fire on Cactus Farm just south of Burra on Thursday.  The fire spread rapidly southeast, destroying a haystack, before blowing across paddocks and into Princess Royal, where it ran for several kilometres before being stopped.  James Reilly was taken to Adelaide for treatment to his burns and his father Matt Reilly suffered burns to his hands from ripping burning clothing from James.  Burra Police, MFS and CFS along with units from Baldina, Mt Bryan, Booborowie, Farrell Flat, Spalding and Clare attended.  [Photo]
