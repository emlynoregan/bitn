Burra RSL held its annual meeting.  President, M.T. Fuller; Secretary, A.L. Bence; Treasurer, A. Coverdale and Pensions Officer, D. Keynes.  The President said they had had a quiet year, but now needed to hold some functions to generate some income and also needed to get a clubroom in anticipation of those young members who would be returning.

Membership this year had reached a record number.  He congratulated Mr G. Stanley hawker on his election as a State Vice-President.  The President reported on the Anzac Day service, when they were able to get the services of the Salvation Army Band from Bowden, which helped to make the march and service such a success.  He felt that more returned men could make the effort to attend the Armistice Day ceremony.  It was decided that on the cessation of hostilities with Germany a Rally of Diggers would be called and a ceremony arranged in conjunction with the Burra Ministersâ€™ Fraternal.
