Burra Unemployed.  A meeting was held on Wednesday with E.W. Crewes in the chair.  Following the reply from the commissioner Mr Crewes thought they needed to ascertain the numbers involved and their dependents.  One complaint was that some single men were kept on and married men with families dismissed.  The Mayor said that only the town reservoir was available locally and the Town Clerk had again wired Adelaide to try to get that moving.

[From Mr Turleyâ€™s remarks it would seem that 30 of the 80 dismissed were Burra men.]

The Mayor and Councillors will form a deputation to the Commissioner urging the reinstatement or the finding of work elsewhere.  M-C Queale said that the number of unemployed registered was 72 with 130 dependents.
