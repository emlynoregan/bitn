Burra Ratepayers’ Meeting

Mr Baulderstone welcomed an unusually large attendance of 55.  After he had introduced the items of business, he accepted the motion of Mr H.C. Cummins that competitive tennis be permissible (upon written application to the Corporation) between 1 p.m. and 6 p.m. on Sundays.  Mr H. Jennison spoke against it – being opposed in principle.  Mr F. Reed spoke in support – mainly citing the financial benefits to the club and through that to the town.  Mr Cummins also spoke in support and it was passed 28 to 18.

The Burra Amateur Swimming Club had been running the pool without a lease and the Mayor felt a lease desirable and so Council had one drawn up to run from 1962 to 1972.  Mr H. Cornelius moved the lease be granted.  This was seconded by T.G. Perry and carried.

A lease for the Burra North Playground was also carried.

Mr Baulderstone appealed for questions to be asked about the amalgamation of the Councils, rather than as street gossip.  He also challenged the view heard in the street that the town was going backwards.  He did not agree.  In the last few years there had been significant improvements at the racecourse, the showgrounds, playground, basketball courts, oval, small bore range, the Post office, the swimming pool and the hospital.  Some progress in the past year had been stifled through lack of money.  Council had sought £1,200 for the school road, but had got only £700.  Numerous bridges needed repair or renewal and again the Kangaroo Street Bridge needed £500, but the grant was for £300, leaving the Council to meet the gap, as it had to for the school road.  The cemetery is old and hard to maintain and permission is being sought to remove headstones.  Tree planting had been encouraged and it is unfortunate that some of the CWA Avenue on the approach to the town had to be removed by the Highways Department to re-form the road.  Burra was a beautiful town, but lends itself to further beautification, especially along the creek and around the pool area.  He had plans in mind to achieve this together with a Caravan Park area.  Street lighting is now quite satisfactory.  The attendance at pictures had declined, but it was still a paying proposition.  The £6,000 borrowed to renovate the Town Hall was covered by a special rate of 4d, but interest and repayments come from the pictures and the rate is merely security.  A bequest from the late Mrs Gare enabled the Town Hall stage to be modified and renovated.  The erratic dumping of rubbish at the mine is causing trouble and needs the Council’s attention in the coming year.

(To be continued.)
