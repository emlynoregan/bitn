Goyder Mayor, Peter Mattey responds to letters critical of the Council’s actions on Paxton Square and the Burra Caravan Park.  He stresses that no decision had been made on the future of the Burra Caravan Park.  While the park is presently financially sustainable, there is increasing pressure to upgrade the facilities.  It is therefore responsible to review its operations.  The seeking of expressions of interest in transferring the business and assets from the Council is part of that review.  (The sale of the land is not included.)  Council had adopted a recommendation from the Paxton Square Cottages Community Committee to move to short term rental to maximise income once existing arrangements had expired on 31 August 2008.  This resulted in the employment of an on-site manager to operate the cottages for short term rental on the Council’s behalf from 1 September 2008 to 30 June 2009.  The Council will be in abetter position to assess the sustainability of the cottages early in 2009 and will consult with the Community prior to making any decision.
