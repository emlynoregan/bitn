St Mary’s Soldiers’ Recreation Club

Despite other functions in the town attendance on Wednesday evening showed that residents approved this much needed innovation.  Mr G.H. Dollman outlined the way the club would operate and said he understood his daughter, Frances Dollman, was its originator.  He said that with a number of soldiers quartered here it was felt that an effort should be made to provide a place where they could go of an evening, for either games, a dance or to sit and read or write.  Several ladies of St Mary’s congregation had got together and this was the result.  Although it had started with the St Mary’s congregation, the club was completely undenominational.  It had been decided to have the hall open Tuesday and Friday nights and Sunday afternoons and evenings.  Gifts of wood had been received and ladies of the RSL unit were going to provide biscuits each week.  Certain ladies of the committee would be present on open nights and would provide supper for 3d and would darn socks or sew on buttons.  Mr Dollman declared the club open.  Mrs Genders, as convener, also spoke.  Lieut. A.R. Thiele spoke on behalf of the troops.  The program started with a dance and then a sing song round the piano led by Mr Dollman.  Miss Halliday sang a song and then the game ‘Push the business on’, followed by other games and dances.
