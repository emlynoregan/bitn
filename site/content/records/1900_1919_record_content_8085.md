Burra Mine.  The Burra Burra Copper Co. was asked some time ago to reduce the royalty paid by tributers from 5/- in the £1 to 2/6 in the £1.  The directors promised some months ago to consider both that and the unwatering of the mine.  A reply now says they are awaiting the results of the magnetic process.
