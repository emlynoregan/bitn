Colleen Woodgate

Booborowie Councillor for 10 years

Believe there is a need to maintain a certain continuity and big picture focus with the new council

Over the years have been involved with many community, sporting and school organisations, library, Council committees, health service boards, etc.

I believe I am an effective and committed Councillor with experience and much still to contribute to the new Council
