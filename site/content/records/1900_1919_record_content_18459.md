Weather:  Saturday Storm

Last Saturday was very windy and dusty.  To the east it was very bad with one report describing a great rising spiral of dust that was brown lower down and changing to red and then spreading out over the horizon to hang like the aurora borealis.  Heavy clouds then gathered and some light rain fell, but not enough to settle the dust.

In the town the wind rose further towards evening and from 11 p.m. to midnight blew like a cyclone.  Trees, fences and roofs of both dwellings and outbuildings were removed by its force.  The accompanying rain was light but steady and caused the creek to begin to flow.  Buildings shook as in an earthquake.

In Kooringa George Herbert had the verandah ripped from the house and the picket fence was flattened.  The roof of the old Primitive Methodist Schoolroom was badly damaged.  The wind from the northeast caught the iron and ripped it from its beams depositing it on the other side of the building.  What was not carried away either fell in or was twisted into many shapes.

A large tree fell across the tennis court fence.

A large piece of ridge-capping was ripped from the old Bible Christian Church and carried across the creek and another two lengths travelled over a quarter of a mile to land in Thames St.  A house in Stock St lost its roof and a number of places lost windows; either from the force of the wind or from flying debris.  Many roofs had guttering torn from them.  Tons of fruit has been stripped from trees and flower gardens have been cut down as with a mower.

On farms wheat crops were laid flat and not bent over, but broken off.  Farmers are trying to collect it for hay, but are having trouble getting it off the fields.  Cocked hay was blown completely away and one farmer lost about four tons.

In Redruth George Bartholomaeus lost the roofs from his outhouses and the iron fowl house was uplifter and rolled along the road.  Several roofs there were lifted and will need repair.  One resident saw his roof lift as much as two feet, but with his weight and that of a couple of buggy wheels he managed to stop it leaving altogether.

A Concert at St Mary’s Hall in the Pipe Organ Fund series is reported.
