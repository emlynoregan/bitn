Burra Mine.  For the past 8 weeks men have been sinking a shaft near Peacock’s Air Shaft and have struck blue carbonate and cuprite ore at 60’.  Green and blue carbonate was struck near the surface and followed down and a crosscut begun with promising results.  The shaft will be continued to water level and another drive done at a suitable place.  This will give an idea of the lode which seems to be extensive.  The shaft is in virgin ground and the lode seems to be extending with depth.  Mr Pryor, the underground manager is cautiously hopeful.  Four men are working at Bunts’s Shaft at a depth of 100’ and though results are not as good they are sufficient to encourage continuation.  Two men at Tinline’s are also continuing.  Water will be a major concern if large scale work is contemplated.
