Ratepayers’ Meeting for Middle Ward in the Institute, 23 November.

Dr Brummitt spoke on his candidature for the Mayoralty.  He had no intention of standing, but a large requisition had convinced him to do so.  He laboured under the disadvantage of lack of experience as a Councillor.  He could not promise great works, as their money was limited.  Previous loans need to be repaid.  About £800 would be available over the three wards.

The question of ward boundaries was worth consideration.  The footway from Kooringa to Aberdeen needed making, but would need to wait until the responsibility for main roads vested in the Council.

Mr Duff spoke as candidate for Middle Ward, but said little.
