Hanson Church [Sunday 20 December]

An army of buggies assembled for the first services at the new church.  Rev. W.F. James preached in the afternoon and Rev. T.B. Angwin in the evening.  Services were crowded and many could not get in for the afternoon service.  One old lady who attended was born on the day of the Battle of Waterloo.  The collection was £4-5-0.  About £25 is needed to meet the cost and this is expected to come in from subscriptions and a tea meeting on Christmas Day.  For the convenience of Burra people the evening train will stop at Hanson for this occasion.
