Mid-North Local Government Assoc.: half-yearly conference.

The Minister of Education and Attorney-General Hon. R.J. Randall gave the address.

Perhaps the most important item on the agenda was the noxious weed question.

The matter of payment for loss of time and the cost of sustenance of members engaged on Council business outside Council boundaries were also discussed at length.
