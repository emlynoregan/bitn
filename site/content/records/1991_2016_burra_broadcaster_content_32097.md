Wind Prospect Pty Ltd is proposing to develop a wind farm in the Mt Bryan-Hallett area.  The proposal is for up to 150 wind energy turbines to produce up to 300 MW.  They would be 3-bladed multi-pitched horizontal axis machines at a height of 110 m (tower plus blade in vertical position.).  They would be located in five clusters on the mounts and ranges.  The feasibility study will include a qualified heritage consultant to cover indigenous and non-indigenous heritage values.
