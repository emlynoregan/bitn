Accident.  A car driven by Rev. W.J.C. Coles collided with Mr I.C. Hall’s baker’s cart driven E. Scroop at the corner of the Black Bridge near L. Day’s Shop.  The driver was thrown from the cart against the stone wall and the horse bolted towards the Kooringa Hotel where it was stopped by Trooper Provis.  Mr Scroop was only slightly hurt and continued on his rounds.  Rev. Coles was not hurt.  Pepper trees make visibility bad at this corner.

[Day’s shop was in the southwest corner of Paxton Square in the original Bible Christian Chapel.]
