After lunch I wandered into ‘Doxo’s’ digs: ‘through tunnels as dark as the inside of your pocket in a coal cellar.  That little trip out was fine; Turkish 75’s were scattering things a foot above your head, and an occasional bomb was thrown in to create a diversion, but in spite of these little kindly attentions I managed to get a good view of the decorations lining the walls of this funny old thoroughfare.  Ducking to avoid a ‘big one’ overhead I ran my head into a projection in the wall in the shape of a pair of boots with feet (or bones in them, and was informed that the owner, who still wore them, was a Turkish chap who had lost all interest in the Dardanelles question…All the way out the spectacle of arms, feet, &c., showing through the walls proved that quite a host had lost all interest in the proceedings.  This [joint of] ‘Doxo’s’ was by no means a drawing room and the air wasn’t exactly sweet…The next turn in the track brought me to the observation station.  I was quickly in possession of a periscope and dodging the dead hand which stuck out stiffly near my right ear I settled down to investigate.  The trenches here are only six or eight yards distant…It’s over four weeks ago since our lads took this position and on that occasion there was a good deal of damage on both sides.  There they are, still out there, just about sin-dried, a sprinkling of khaki mixed with the blue, shot-torn and riddled. Form after form shows up plainly in the mirror, pile after pile, mostly blue clad.  To bury them is an impossibility.  And in the heat of all the days – well - flies.’

[The article goes on the compare conditions on the western front, where troops can be withdrawn for rest and recreation, with the conditions at Gallipoli where for almost five months the Australians had held on under constant fire, without relief and catching snatches of sleep in spite of thundering artillery and bombardment.  It continues with reminiscences of home and an appeal for men at home to ‘Come out and help to see the game through and in after years call yourself a man and meet those questioning eyes without dread or fear.’]
