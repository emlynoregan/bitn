Burra Cheer-up Soc.

The Ladies’ band went to Morgan last Saturday.  Provided by I.J. Warnes and organised by G.E. Dane, seven cars left Burra at 9.30 a.m. and reached Morgan about 1 p.m. after a refreshment stop before the town.  They marched in to a crowd at the Terminus Hotel where they played selections and had lunch before joining the PS Decoy where they played for the railway men.  They were taken past homes inundated by the floodwaters and windmills and trees.  They played again and returned to Morgan about 6 p.m. for dinner at the Terminus Hotel.  Mr Warnes was thanked with cheers and applause as was Mr Dane for his organisation.  Mr Crewes thanked the Gem Navigation Co. for supplying the boat and trip free.  [Details in 1⅓ columns.]
