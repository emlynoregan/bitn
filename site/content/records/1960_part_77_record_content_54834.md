Ian Auhl letter concerning the resiting of Burra Mine buildings.

Now that Grave’s Pump House and Peacock’s Chimney Stack and Pump House are not in immediate danger of demolition, attention can be given to dismantling, resiting and re-erecting the buildings.  There appears to be a two year reprieve dating from September 1970, which gives a breathing space of eighteen months.

I am sure that with a little good will this is possible.  Problems are architectural and financial.

I submit the following steps as a plan of action:

Request the Minister of Conservation (Mr Broomhill) to call a meeting of interested parties.  (A request made perhaps jointly by the Burra Burra DC and the National Trust.)

Survey, planning and numbering of the masonry.  (A major and expensive task for the two pump houses.)

I have been contacted by a professional and reputable architect who will undertake the initial survey voluntarily.

Samin is interested in the speedy removal of the buildings and have expressed a willingness to assist in demolition and storage of the stone work.

My suggestions for resiting:

Peacock’s Chimney and Pump House to be re-erected on the mine hill where they would be visible from the by-pass

Grave’s Pump House to be re-erected at the old Mine entrance close to the Burra-Burra North Road.

An architect and contractor I consulted both see these position as suitable.

6.	Little finance would be needed to this stage.

7.	These are state heritage items so finance should not be just a local issue.

8.	A building contractor has suggested re-erection costs should be considerably less than $10,000 per building, given free architectural services and help from Samin in demolition.

9.	This money does not have to be found immediately.

10.	Sources of Funding:

The Government has accepted some of the moral responsibility for the future of the buildings and could contribute something each financial year.

The National Trust, both Burra and Adelaide.

Public subscription – making this via the National Trust would make donations tax deductible.

Burra Burra DC – I cannot believe, despite the article in last week’s Record that they would contribute nothing.

Tourist grant.

Re-erection as funds permit.  The contractor has consented to give a detailed estimate.  This broad outline only comes from five years’ involvement with the town I love and is aimed at one thing only; the preservation of the Burra Mine buildings.  I am willing to come to Burra at any time with the architect, building contractor and others who are offering help.
