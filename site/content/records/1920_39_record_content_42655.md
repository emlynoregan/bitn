Burra Town Council, 18 July

A notice concerning closing of roads at Hampton has been gazetted.

Outstanding rates total £166.  In the North Ward there is £44 owed and £33 on unclaimed blocks.  The equivalent in East Wards is £50 plus 17/2 and in West Ward £30 plus £1-10-0.

[This actually totals £159-7-6.]

On the matter of unclaimed blocks the Mayor questioned whether, in the event of the Council acting to sell them, they would become liable for unpaid water rates.

The Town Clerk will check this.  They could not be sold for three months after being advertised.

Various road works were approved.

Arrangements for cutting out rates through work were left in the hands of the Mayor as Chairman of the Public Works.

There were complaints that straying cows in Aberdeen were smashing fences and destroying shrubs etc.

Cr Jennison felt the ranger and pound-keeper should be stirred up: ‘it was not a mystery as to the ownership of the cows.’

Cr March referred to obstructions on the footpath at Whittney & Tiver’s premises.

The Town Clerk said the footpath was on the property of the owners of the property.

Cr Bevan moved for improved drainage near Messrs Villis & Short’s.  There was a real duck pond there.  Carried.  [New Aberdeen]
