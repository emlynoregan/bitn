Burra Rifle Club 27 & 28 August

Nine members travelled to Gawler for the annual two-day meet of the No. 4 District Union.  The weather was unfavourable and rain on the night of the 27th caused modification of the program.  Burra men did well and brought back nearly Â£15 of the prize money.  In aggregate the best were S. Cordon 129 and A.B. Riggs 127.
