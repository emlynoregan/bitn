Obituary.  Richard Reed died on 17 April at the residence of his daughter (Clara) Mrs Will. H. Gare at Redruth, after a brief illness.  He was 93.  He was born at Lostwithel [sic] in Cornwall in 1837 and came to Australia with his parents when 10.  They lived first in a dugout in the Burra creek at Kooringa and his first job was as a boy ore picker.  He rose then to whim driver and finally to tributer.  He went to the Victorian goldfields, but was unsuccessful and on his return bought a team of bullocks and carted wood for the mine.  In 1863 he took up land at Wandillah near Burra, still held by his youngest son, James.  He started sheep farming in one of the worst droughts, but hung on and was eventually successful.  He retired almost 30 years ago.  Three sons survive and two daughters: Richard Reed (Redruth), John Reed (Gawler), James Reed (Aberdeen), Mrs C. Bartholomaeus (Glenelg) & Mrs W.H. Gare (Aberdeen).  Another daughter Mrs G. Sara died some years ago.

There are 27 surviving grandchildren & 25 great-grandchildren.

[This was corrected in 51, 17, 30 April, page 2 by saying that Mrs George Sara also survives.]

[Born 22 January 1837 Lostwithiel Cornwall.]
