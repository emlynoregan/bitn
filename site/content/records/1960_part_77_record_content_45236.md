Burra Primary School held its sports Day last Friday.  The day was marked by dust, wind, thunder, lightning and then torrential rain.  The march past and part of the House Competition took place before the day had to be abandoned, with events to be run if possible on the school oval during the week.  Despite the weather the competition for a donated lamb (from Mr Ray Alderson) raised $76.50, the gate was $30, the trading table took $50 and drinks raised $21 for a total nearing $180.  [Results will be printed next issue.]
