Booborowie Wheat Yields have been up to a shade over 14 bags per acre, but some yields were poor.  Oats yields of 12-15 bags per acre were common.  Lucerne has made good growth after recent thunderstorms.

Mrs Bob Cousins last week found in her garden a penny-sized copper disc that has been identified as one of the first dog discs ever issued.  The Dog Act was declared in 1884 and this disc registered its wearer from July 1885 to June 1886 and was issued by the Burra Town Council.
