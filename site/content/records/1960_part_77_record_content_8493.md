Burra Lawn Tennis Club held its AGM and elected President, R. Osborne; Vice-President, I. Allen; Secretary, D. Lubcke and Treasurer, R. Riedel.

With costs of c. Â£200 p.a. to maintain the courts it is necessary to have considerable support from players.  To try to increase membership numbers, the fees have been reduced to 30/- adults plus 2/- ball fees and for juniors at school 10/- plus 1/- ball fees.  Opening day will be 29 October.
