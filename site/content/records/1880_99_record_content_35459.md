Editorial: Is Life Worth Living?

To many perhaps it is not - to the poor and outcast, to the very ill, and on to the injustice of one man having a thousand times more to live on than another.  For so long as this is so there will be misery and weariness of life, ending as expected.

‘Workers look out, the elections are at hand; you have the thing in your own hands.’

Kooringa Primitive Methodist Church Harvest Thanksgiving Services next Sunday and Monday.

Letter to editor complaining of the lack of action in restoring the Pig and Whistle footbridge.

Sports News from overseas is dominated by horse racing and boxing.

Locally there will be another horse race at Springbank tomorrow at 3 p.m. between R. Austin’s Happy Eliza and W. Henderson’s Converted Jane.
