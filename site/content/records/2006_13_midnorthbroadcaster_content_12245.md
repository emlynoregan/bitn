Stuart Norris of Pharaoh’s Tomb & Burra antique Centre writes an open letter to the people of the town district to counter rumour and innuendo.  He says he has never stolen anything or handled stolen goods.  He has never been charged with a criminal offence or been arrested.  He has been in business here for 17 years with a clean record and will continue to buy and sell good antiques, petrol bowsers, signs and collectables.
