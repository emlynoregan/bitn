Barkers of Baldina Homes Inc. held its AGM last week.  Chairman Jock Duncan presented his report:

Units 9 & 11 had bathroom upgrades, leaving only two others to be done.

All Chapel Street homes now have ducted air conditioning.

Lighting has been improved in Commercial Street units.

During the year two tenants died; Mr Ernst Osterhage and Mr Geoff Pearce.  Also Mrs Audrey Little and Mrs Secomb moved into higher level care.

New residents were Mrs Pat Hanlin in Unit 1 Commercial Street and Mr John Stockman in Unit 3 Chapel Street.

Two units are currently available in Pearse Row, Commercial Street.

Jock Duncan was re-elected as Chairman, with Ron Thamm as Vice Chairman and John Arthur as Secretary.

The Barkers of Baldina Cottage Homes in Commercial Street were first built in 1970, since when 75 people have lived there.  Mr Barker left a bequest for high quality retirement accommodation for the aged in Burra.  Firstly nine units were built in Commercial Street, followed by a further five in Chapel Street* and more recently by four more in John Barker Street.

[*This seems to imply that the Chapel Street units were built after 1970.  They have all the appearances of older stone buildings and it seems more likely that they were adapted for this new purpose, rather than actually built.  Further research would be needed to verify their history.]

All units are fully equipped, air conditioned, have carpets and are maintained regularly.  Lawns are cared for and small gardens are available for tenants.  There is a mixture of one and two bedroom units.  Previous Chairmen of the Board have been the late Ron Pearse and Mr Ray Jennison.
