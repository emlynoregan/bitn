Letter.  Stephen Kerrigan, Goyder Council CEO writes a long letter focused on vandalism.

Vandalism has increased over the past two years.

It takes workers away from the other jobs they could/should be doing.

It costs the community on average $400 per week or:-

$20,800 p.a. for damage to toilets

$19,988 p.a. for damage to street signs

$2,964 p.a. to re-erect white guide posts

$13,439 p.a. to replace white guide posts

$1,820 to repair pine railings in Burra

Overall the cost is c. $56,000 p.a.

The damage is largely (though not exclusively) the work of a small group of young people for whose behaviour parents must shoulder some of the responsibility.

He goes on to list the possible penalties, but stresses that in order for these to have an impact on the problem, the offenders have to be caught and the community needs to be united in reporting offences/offenders if there is to be any impact on the problem.
