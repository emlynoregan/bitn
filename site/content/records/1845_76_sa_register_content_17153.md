Kooringa News, 4 February

Accident.  Mr A. Riggs of Diprose’s Creek was thrown from his horse when it shied as he passed over the bridge near there.  He fell against one of the posts, breaking an arm and suffering other injuries.

Accident.  On Tuesday at about 6.30 p.m. while two miners were down securing, the earth slipped and ran, carrying the men with it for 8 or 9 fathoms.  It was 11 p.m. before they could be released.  One sustained a broken thigh and the other a broken jawbone.  They are called Kitto and Hocking or Hoskins and have not been long on the Mine.

A sale of goods saved from Mr Stanbury’s fire took place on Monday and realised about £90.

The Campbell Minstrels gave an entertainment at the Burra Hotel last night.  It was very well attended.

The usual fortnightly cattle sale was held at Smith’s yards yesterday and about 20 head were sold at fair prices.
