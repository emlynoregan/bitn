The Old Court House Co-operative finally opened its craft shop over the Easter Weekend.  It was a roaring success.  The tea room also did a busy trade and is still open every weekend 12 noon to 2 p.m.  Another new activity for the Easter Weekend was the commencement of the Old Court House Restaurant â€“ operated by another group of unemployed people and offering quality dining on Friday and Saturday nights.
