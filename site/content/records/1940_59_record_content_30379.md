Burra Town Council, 17 February

Mainly routine matters.

The Clerk reported 136 dogs registered; 46 more than for 1946.  He thought hundred of dogs were not registered.

It was resolved to write to the Railways Department again complaining about the bad state of repair of Railway Road.

It was resolved to write to the Housing Trust asking them to advise the Council about the building of houses [in Burra] because the Mayor would like to see some of the housing in Burra condemned.
