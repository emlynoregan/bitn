On Tuesday night last week [14 March] the old White Hart Hotel was nearly all destroyed by fire.  It was used as the home of Mrs A. Sara and partly by the Boy Scouts for their gatherings.  The house belonged to Mr James Reed.  It was one of the oldest buildings in the town, being built 65 years ago.  [1851] It comprised 22 rooms and was not insured.  The fire broke out when no one was at home.  The Boy Scouts were at the Institute giving a concert and the alarm was raised during the interval.  Captain Truscott was raised by the bell rung by Mr Crewes.  He got the hose and hydrant, but then had trouble getting to Aberdeen.  Several cars sped past without stopping and eventually Mr Lord got his car out and took Mr Truscott to the fire.  They arrived within 20 minutes of the fire being discovered, but lack of practice still delayed then from plying the fire with water.  The front part of the house was then saved.  Mrs Sara’s furniture had already been largely saved except for the kitchen and her own bedroom.  The Scouts’ Rooms and equipment were saved.  In the process the water from the hose brought down a ceiling on top of a number of men, but fortunately it was lath and plaster and did little damage except to blacken them.  The origin of the fire is unclear, but perhaps a spark in the kitchen was responsible.
