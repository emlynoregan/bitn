Kooringa News, 24 January

I am told a person has arrived from England who is to undertake the reduction of the poorer ores here.  If he is successful it would be a great benefit for Kooringa as there are hundreds of tons of such ore lying about the mine and washed down the creek and their treatment would crate many jobs.

Mr H. Dawson, who has the contract for the North-eastern Mail, has this morning started a new conveyance, built to his specifications by Messrs Barlow & Sons of Adelaide.  It is said to be built to suit bush roads, and is at once commodious, light and strong.
