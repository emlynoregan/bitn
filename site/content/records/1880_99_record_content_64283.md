Editorial on the graziers’ meeting at the Institute on Friday where over a dozen Hundreds were represented.  Twenty years ago rents were 10/- to 12/- per mile[2] and now they averaged £2-13-4 and there were other rates and taxes.  In the last 15 years 3 had been good and 2 passable.  The problems are not of the graziers’ making, but are due to drought, rabbits and dingoes.  Not far east of Burra there is a block of 40,000 acres which has not returned 1d for the last three years, though over £1,000 has been spent in improvements.  They are asking for vermin-proof fences and security of tenure.
