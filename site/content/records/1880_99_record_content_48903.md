Burra Town Council, 16 February.

There was big public interest and the chamber was crowded.  A warm meeting followed.

The mayor’s report was to have been expunged from the minutes on notice of motion from Cr G. Parks.  This lapsed to allow the matter to be dealt with in another way.

Subsequently standing orders were suspended and Cr Parks moved: ‘That the Mayor’s Report as entered in the minute book of January 16 be now expunged.’

The Mayor refused to take the motion and declared it informal.

Cr Parks afterwards handed the Town Clerk the following notice: ‘That a call of the whole Council be made on Monday, March 6, 1893 at 8 o’clock, for the purpose of expunging the mayor’s report as entered in the minute book of January 16 1893.’

Rev. Daddow wrote again on Mr Hogarth’s lecture and subsequent letter.

The Burra Accidental Bicycle Club held a fancy dress tournament at the Burra Oval on 14 February.  The night was dark and unsuitable, but 4-500 came anyway and enjoyed themselves.  £5 was taken towards promoting the 50 mile race on Easter Monday.  There was a one mile fancy dress handicap and a series of other events including a quarter mile slow race.  The Burra Band attended.

A Rifle Match is to be fired today for a £6 prize presented by Mrs Dawes.  (Men must be in uniform.)

Two Polo Matches will be played on Saturday at Burra, between Mt Crawford and Burra.  Burra Team 1: E. Bowman, C.W. Bowman, H. Bowman & W.A. Murray.

Burra Team 2: A. Gebhardt, C. Gebhardt, W.G. Hawkes, F.W. Whyte.

Election Campaign.  G.H. Lake’s supporters met at the Institute last Friday night.

Mr Thomas Pascoe of Terowie, another candidate, visited on Wednesday.

Theft.  Someone has stolen the collection box from the Burra Hospital.
