Peter Brodie writes expressing his great concern over the transfer of the Burra Hospital Title to the Lower North

Health Advisory Council.  He believes they have no authority and no assets apart from the Burra Hospital and all its assets.  He believes Burra has less than one third of the representatives on the Council and the public is not welcome to its meetings.  He is fearful that the Burra Hospital in the future will have even less management and community support that the Keith Hospital and could now be classed as a private hospital.  He would be glad to be corrected about this matter.
