The Second Annual Burra Duathlon took place on Saturday – running and cycling.

The short course was 3.9 km of running and 7 km cycling.  1st was Michael Phillips of Saddleworth.

[After Danny Salter of Clare realised he had missed seeing an arrow and so missed out on 1.2 km of track and so withdrew from the event.]

The 1st Burra person to finish was the Junior Winner, Jake Norris in 41 minutes 23 seconds.  Toby Murphy followed six seconds later, then Bradley Wall 16 seconds after that.

The Open Ladies Short Course winner was Jane Parker of Burra in 44 minutes 36 seconds.

The big course was 5.4 km running and 34 km cycling.  First home was Daniel Van Loggem of Ingle Farm in 1 hour 29 minutes 18 seconds and, being under 20 years old was also Junior Winner.
