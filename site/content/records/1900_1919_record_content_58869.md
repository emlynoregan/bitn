Influenza.

There has been an outbreak at the Girls’ Reformatory, but fortunately the cases of all the four girls and one officer affected have been mild.  The picture show on Saturday was ordered cancelled and schools have been closed for a week, but reopened on Monday as there were no fresh signs of the disease.  The Central Board of Health sent to Burra the full equipment for a 20-bed hospital, which was due to arrive Monday evening.

Dr Ramsay Smith of the Central Board of Health said in an outbreak the local hospital should not be used.  Military authorities would not allow the Drill Hall to be used.  He would inspect the Skating Rink as a possibility.  Virulent cases could spring up inexplicably among mild ones and pneumonia might develop immediately or not for 6-7 days.  The school could be kept open with a 15-30 minute inspection daily by the Medical Officer.
