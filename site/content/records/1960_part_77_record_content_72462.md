Burra Burra DC

The rate has been increased by 0.2 cents in the dollar, but the extra $11,700 in revenue will not solve the Councilâ€™s financial problems and if Government aid does not increase then retrenchment of the workforce will have to be undertaken.  The attitude of the Federal Government is particularly deplorable.  Through traffic from the eastern states is considerable and the wet year has also increased the damage to surfaces.  Burra has been changed from a zoning of Region 8 to Region 7, to its detriment and is seeking reinstatement.  Council has decided to accept the boundary changes as recommended by the Local Government Royal Commission.  There has been no real progress on the common effluent drainage system pending a decision whether the Government will provide the necessary subsidy.
