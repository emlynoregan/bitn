The Mid North Carriage driving Club event provided plenty of excitement for drivers and spectators last weekend.  At 9 a.m. the formal Presentation at Halt and Concourse de Elegance was held in Taylor Street.  Local organisers Geraldine Smedley and Donna Kelly were disappointed with the number of entries, but those who entered praised the course layout for Sundayâ€™s marathon.  Next year the Mid North Carriage Driving Club is hosting the State Championship combined driving event at Clare.  [Photo.]
