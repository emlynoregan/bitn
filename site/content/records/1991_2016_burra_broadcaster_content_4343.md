BCS.  The boarding facility for isolated students at the former nurses’ home at Burra Hospital was opened last Sunday by Mr Terry Trotta, representing the Federal Minister of Education.  The 60 or so guests included local MP Barry Wakelin.  The Hospital Board made the building available in August 1992 and by February 1993 there were ten students there under the supervision of house-parent Anne Breeding.  The current house-parent is Rhonda Cooper.  Next year there will be 17 occupants.  $129,000 in Commonwealth funds aided the conversion of the building.  [Photo of Mr Trotta with Mr Dick Secomb.]
