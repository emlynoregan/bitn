4.  Improved communications with the Commission.

5.  No loss of ownership of the Hospital by the Board.  It will remain under the ownership and control of the Community through an elected Board of Directors.

6.  Better working relationship with the SA Health Commission.

Points against:

1.  Once so incorporated the situation cannot be reversed.

2.  The Central Bureaucracy gains more power over the Hospital and can more easily direct what services the Hospital can or cannot provide â€“ but it already has this power to direct services in all Public Hospitals through the budget process.
