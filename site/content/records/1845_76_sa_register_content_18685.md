Steelton News

A public meeting held in the Steelton schoolroom on 17 June considered the report of Mr Macaulay on the lines of road for the Main North Road.  William Mahood presided.  He said at the Board meeting Mr McEwin, & Mr Hallett had said the old road was the best.  But on what basis?  It could not be desirable to have a main road run between two ranges of hills with a breadth of only about two miles of agricultural land.  On the east range there was no gap or available road for 14 miles and on the west one gap in 15 miles.  Mr Mahood thought the two gentlemen should not have formed premature opinions.

Mr Miller said the No. 6 road was the most advantageous.  It was shorter than No. 1 and No. 6 (or the middle road) from Springfield to Black Springs and Kooringa would meet both the prayers of the Kooringa memorialists and the farmers of the Steelton neighbourhood and perhaps gratify everyone except the Copper Co.  Advocates of the middle road should commend the No. 6 route.

Mr Macaulay is wrong in assessing the old road as best for water.  [The middle road] has 9 Government reserves with constant water on or near the line of road.

Mr Davison said the middle line of road had only its own merits to recommend it and not any influential company interest to back it.  The middle road as represented by the No. 6 route in Mr Macaulayâ€™s report was the right road.

A letter expressing these views will be sent to the Central Road Board signed by the chairman.

The Steelton Hotel is progressing fast and should be finished in a fortnight.  It will be a great accommodation for travellers as present there is no [public] house of the kind between Springfield and Black Springs on this road.
