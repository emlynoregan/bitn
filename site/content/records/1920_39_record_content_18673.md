RSL met on 13 February to consider the moving of the guns from Market Square.  Dr Steele was unable to attend, but sent a letter voicing his view that the guns have a role in creating an interest in our history and provoking coming generations to ask why men went to fight and die for Empire and freedom.  They tell of the honour of war and should remain.  They can be so placed and enclosed as to remove the impression of just being dumped there.  The meeting expressed a wish that the guns be placed between the Memorial and the Rotunda: one facing east and the other west.  The whole to be surrounded by a fence or chain and the guns suitably placed on concrete stands and appropriately preserved.
