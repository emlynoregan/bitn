Burra Town Council.

The Government has agreed to retimber the Waterworks well at an estimated cost of Â£120, provided the Council pays 5% interest on this amount which will be added to the capital account.

Council will ask that they be allowed to do the work and charge it to the capital account as they are sure they can get it done far more cheaply that the Government estimate.
