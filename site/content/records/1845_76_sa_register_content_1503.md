New Riches at Burra Burra Mines

Stocks’s Shaft has been deepened with the aid of a new water whim and in the process a magnificent lode of copper ore has been laid open.  The exposed part occupies the full 10 ft x 8½ ft of the shaft, but its full extent is yet to be ascertained.

The success here has encouraged the Bon Accord owners (otherwise known as the Sydney Co.’s Mine).  Mr Moorhead, Captain Spargo and other employees had arrived at the property and broke fresh ground.

A shepherd has also found surface specimens of promise on Mr Johnson’s property.
