Editorial on ‘The Occupations of the People’

In the last ten years the number of farmers has increased by 1,441 and the number of farm labourers by 3,143.  Miners have risen from 1,908 to 3,338.  Workers at the Burra Mines declined in the decade from 916 to 111 and at Kapunda from 287 to 119, but copper miners overall have increased from 1,264 to 2,100, mostly due to developments on Yorke Peninsula.  Overall the increase in employment in mining, agriculture and stock-raising has been 2,831 in the decade or about 280 p.a. – not much to boast about.  There has been a larger increase in the unproductive and middlemen classes.  Those employed by general and local government have risen from 822 to 1,495.  Much of this is due to the overland telegraph, but even allowing for this the increase of 30-40% cannot be justified.  There has also been a large increase in the professions not in Government service.  [Figures are given.]

Ministers of religion increased from 144 to 245.  Those employed in commerce, trade and manufacturing have risen from 13,899 to 20,267.  Manufacturing persons engaged in art and mechanical productions and in working and dealing in mineral, animal and vegetable matters show a pleasing increase.

[Further details of increases in the ‘non-productive’ classes are then given.]
