National Trust.  Three new guides have joined the National Trust team as well as a new handyman.  Bronwyn Wilson and Ann Angerove will begin work next month with young Callum Martin (17) who will guide visitors through the Old Bon Accord, Morphett’s Enginehouse and Malowen Lowarth, while dressed in old fashioned mining outfit.  Peter McGuiness will start in July as the new handyman.  Malowen Lowarth Night Tours are back until October.
