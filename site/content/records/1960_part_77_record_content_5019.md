Characteristics of the paper for 1960

In general there is a satisfactory coverage of local news, though the paper is beginning to carry material directly relevant to nearby towns as well.  Hallett in particular gets a considerable coverage, with District Council reports for example.  Some articles fail initially to make clear which town is being reported.

There is some evidence of careless editing with jumbled print not always being corrected in time or even referred to in the next issue so that it might be clarified.

Almost all the news except sport appears on page one.  Photographs put in an occasional appearance, but as yet remain a week at least after the event.

Sports as always get a great deal of space.  District Council reports are extensive, but not always very informative.  A long list of letters received conveys no real information.  Even an explanation that the letter concerned  a particular road or building etc. is useless if it fails to say what the concern was.

Note that this summary has generally ignored events reported from other towns in the district.
