Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting was held on Monday night with Mr Treloar in the chair.

The Mayor read his report.  There were apologies:

Cr Greenwood and Mr Thomas were unwell.

Cr McWaters was suffering from an attack of modesty.

Cr Killicoat was caught in a dust storm out east.

Cr McBride, who is standing for re-election said West Ward had a substantial credit balance because they had preferred to defer work while wartime costs were three times normal.

Clem Pearce said he was standing because he thought Councillors should be residents and Mr McBride was not.  He thought the number of private electrical systems had made a town scheme impossible.  He favoured planting fewer trees, but attending to them better.

Mr Sampson, candidate for East Ward, would do his best if elected.

Mr Kellaway, also for East Ward, was in favour of tar-paving, but more economical methods should be employed.  He also favoured more attention to fewer trees and fencing in the back streets.  All meat should be inspected by the Council inspector.

All Councillors favoured a bridge at the ‘Pig & Whistle’ when funds were available – though they also agreed ratepayers’ approval would first be sought.

Mr Crewes said he would endeavour to get the districts involved with the soldiers’ memorial.
