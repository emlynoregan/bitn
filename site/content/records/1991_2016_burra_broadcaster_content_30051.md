Article on Porter Lagoon

1876 - William Lunn and friend drown in the lagoon while duck shooting.  (Lunn was the founder of Spalding and great-grandfather of Burra resident Garth Lunn.

1926 – A syndicate was formed after a meeting at H.C. Atkins’ home, to build a 16 foot clinker boat.  People paid 6 pence an hour for a ride on Sundays and Public holidays and 2/6 an hour on other days.

1927 – The boat was christened ‘The Swan’ by Mrs Atkins at a special sports day.  A single plank jetty was erected and in late 1927 another boat, ‘The Gull’ was bought.  A shed was erected and a ladies only bathing area was declared.  Planning began for a regatta for Australia Day 1928.

1928 – The tradition of an Australia Day Regatta kicked off with events that included: bobbing for corks, four oar swim, tub race, 100 yard swim, slippery pole, riding the barrel, 440 yard swim.

1929 – Athletic events were added to the regatta and a dance was held [At Farrell Flat] in the evening.

1930 – With lower water level more athletic events were added along with sheaf tossing.

1937 – The lake was dry and salt was being harvested.  At their peak, thousands were attending the regattas.  Swings and seesaws were erected on the shore, there was a plentiful supply of cool drinks and ice cream and catering was done in the boat shed.

WWII – When war broke out the boats were sold and moved to Fisherman’s Bay and the other assets were also sold.

1950s – The water returned and water skiing became popular.  The Australian Water Skiing Championships were held there and the Pt Adelaide Sailing Club came along.

1970s – Motor boats and water skiing dominated activities.  Stockman’s boat burnt and sank.

1993 – The lagoon filled and spread across the highway.

2003 – Presently the lagoon is dry – though a small patch of water may be visible in early morning, only to disappear later.  David Kellock recalls it being similar in 1967.  Laurel Neill says old folk last recalled it being completely dry in 1914.
