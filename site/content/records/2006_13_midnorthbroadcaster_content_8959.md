The Burra Show held last Saturday was a great success with gate takings almost equalling the 2008 record.  Professor Michael Tyler from the University of Adelaide opened the show.  This was also the occasion for the granting of life membership to Pat and Bob Greet for their many years of service as secretary and assistant secretary.  Both have given countless hours to the maintenance of the showgrounds and to setting up for the show and cleaning up afterwards.  President David Thamm was very pleased to present the life memberships.  As well as the exhibits, the rides were particularly popular. The Ali Baba ride and the V8 simulator car proved especially attractive.  About 20 cars were involved in the ute and car competition along with a static display exhibited by Les Warnes and Roger Cross.  The AGL Min North Shearing Championship was a strong drawcard and reigning Open Champion Daryl Andriske from Blyth successfully defended his title.  The sheep dog trials were enjoyed and the Horses in Action continued a fine tradition.
