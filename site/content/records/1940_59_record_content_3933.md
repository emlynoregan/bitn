William Carpenter writes re the Mongolata Mail.

The Department has no intention of closing the PO or discontinuing the mail at present.  It did enquire recently whether a once a week service would suffice, but on the situation being explained it retained the twice a week service.  The position is however, that after nine years resident I find it impossible to carry on profitably and have decided to leave at the end of the year.  The Department is calling for someone capable of conducting the P.O. and running the service.  The mail service carries a salary of £52 p.a. and the P.O. an allowance of c. £17-10-0.  The residential population of Mongolata is about 20: seven years ago there were over 120 on the field.  At present only 11 men are employed and 7 of these reside in Burra, leaving only four wage earners residing on the field.  It is very unfortunate if these people are to be deprived of the P.O. through no fault of their own.
