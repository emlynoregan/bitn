Parliamentary Visit to Burra, Friday 16 August, and Labor Party Social.

[Report runs to about 4¾ columns.]

At the last minute the Premier, Rt Hon. T. Price was unable to come, but the delegation comprised the Chief Secretary, Commissioner of Crown Lands & Messrs Denny, Goode, Jackson, Miller & Newland.  They arrived by the midday train and were met by members of the Town Council and Thomas Davis, President of the local Labor Party Branch.  They went to the school, where the Cadet Corps formed a guard of honour and performed a drill.  The school was then inspected and Dr Sangster, as Chairman of the Burra School Board of Advice, raised the matter of the school being made a Continuation School as it would save much expense for parents if children could complete their education locally.  Mr G. Scott, the head teacher, gave a history of the school – there are 283 presently on the roll.

The children sang The Song of Australia and Joyce Taplin recited Excelsior.

The visitors then went to the Reformatory, the Mine and the Burra Hospital, among other places.

A sumptuous spread was provided at Miss Vivian’s Court House Hotel, and in the evening the party went to the Institute, where they gave addresses on the current state of politics interspersed with songs.  The hall was decorated and bedecked with Labor Party slogans.

Chief Secretary, Hon. Kirkpatrick said the closer settlement scheme was a major plank of the party.  Owners of large estates were being fairly compensated: where necessary with a fair price + 15%.  Civil servants were getting 7/- a day.  The NT problem was being solved and would save them £120,000 p.a.  The Party was still pursuing Legislative Council reform and wanted to see household suffrage.  At present the Legislative Council represented only 2/7 of the population.

Commissioner of Crown Lands, Hon. L. O’Loughlin (a Liberal in coalition with Labor) said he was glad that despite the lack of compulsory purchase they had been able to buy up Petherton, Shafton, Braefoot and Cartapo, among other estates, for closer settlement.  They had only about 5,000,000 acres of agricultural land within Goyder’s Line and therefore these large estates could not be allowed to lock up this limited agricultural land ‘to no good purpose’.  He also supported Legislative Council reform.

W.J. Denny.

His speech was devoted to the then current clash between the House of Assembly and the Legislative Council over the reform of the latter.

W. Miller continued on the same theme.

Mr Goode continued on the franchise and on other matters currently blocked by the Upper House, which was ‘on strike’. 

Mr Jackson continued on the franchise.

Mr J. Newland basically thanked electors for his recent success and for the success of this Labor Party Social as well as endorsing the reforms already canvassed.  The Party had had some local concerns brought to their attention, which would be addressed on their return to Adelaide.

Mr O’Loughlin proposed a vote of thanks to those assisting in making the meeting a success.

Mr Miller proposed the vote of thanks to the chairman.

Mr Davis suitably replied.

Refreshments and a ball followed.
