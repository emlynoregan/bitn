Obituary.  Mr John R. Field died at Burra Hospital 23 April.  He was born in Cardiff, Wales on 9 January 1853 the eldest son of the late Mr & Mrs Richard Field.  He arrived in SA with his parents in 1856 and they came directly to Burra by bullock dray.  Mr Field Sen. was employed at the mine and so was his son on first leaving school.  Later with his father he went stone-walling at Booborowie until 1866 when Mr Field took over land, first at Princestown near Kooringa and later at Shafton where they made a permanent home, naming it ‘Monavea’ after their old home in Wales.  His father made a success of grazing and farming.  On his death John carried on and he now leaves two sons to keep up the reputation of ‘Monavea’ Mr Richard Field gave some £1,000 towards St Mary’s Building Fund.  The deceased was fond of sport.   Late in life [he was 53] he married Miss Lucy Tucker of Sandergrove near Strathalbyn who survives with two sons, Messrs John Robert (Bert) & Darrell.  A brother Arthur Field lives at Clarence Park and a Sister Mrs Alice Wyatt lives at Henley Beach Road.

[John Richard Field]
