Mr Geer has for some time been employed here in a drapery establishment, but at the last Wesleyan Conference he was appointed to a ministerial position at Mt Gambier.  He took his farewell of the church here on Monday evening when Rev. Lloyd presented him with a testimonial from the church in the form of a fine copy of Bensonâ€™s Commentaries.
