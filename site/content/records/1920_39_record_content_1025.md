Presentation to Ex-Mayor E.W. Crewes at Burra Institute last Wednesday.

The Boy Scouts provided a Guard of Honour and Mayor, S.M. Lane took the chair.

The mayor said they were assembled to recognise the effort of Mr Crewes during the war years, which represented five years of hard work.  Mr Crewes had been Mayor during the Boer War and through the Great War.  The illuminated address by Mr Hann was a real work of art.  It noted E.W. Crewes’ presidency of the Burra Cheer-up Society, Australia Day Committee, All-British League, Soldiers’ Aid Society, Wounded Soldiers’ Fund, The Ladies Band, War & Peace Loan Committees, Peace Day Celebrations and the Repatriation Fund.  Under his fervour Burra & District contributed over £60,000 to the various War Funds and saw over 600 men enlist.  The document listed the war effort for the district: 600 men enlisted along with 13 nurses, 4 clergy & 2 doctors.  78 were killed.  £89,000 had been raised for War Loans and £60,000 places in Patriotic Funds.  £1,900 had been raised for the War Memorial.

As well as the address Mr Lane presented Mr Crewes with a solid silver tray suitably engraved and weighing 111 oz.

W.G. Hawkes spoke in support expressing amazement at the energy displayed by the ex-Mayor, his ability and his unfailing enthusiasm.  He also took the opportunity to commend Rev. D.B. Bridgwood who was leaving Burra.

Dr Steele spoke as President of the local RSL Sub-Branch and Rev. D.B. Bridgwood also spoke in support.

Cr Radford said Mr Crewes had done all his war work without neglecting the normal duties of the Mayoralty.  Rev. G.K. Haslam, John Drew, Capt. Hammatt (Salvation Army), Mr Treloar & E.J. Davey all spoke in support.

Mr Crewes replied saying he had but done his duty.  He had been accused of spending too much on flags, but it was an inspiration to all – standing for ‘freedom truth and righteousness’.  Peace Day, when nearly £2,000 had been contributed to the memorial for the fallen was a proud day for him.  He had been about 165 times to welcome boys home at the station, but the Ladies Band had done more.  He had seen members trudging there in the rain with their instruments, but they kept their ‘heart and soul in the business and saw it through’.

The Cheer-up Band played in the evening.
