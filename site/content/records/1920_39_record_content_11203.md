Obituary.  A.F. Heinrich died 18 June in his tent at Boolcoomatta.  His coffin was sent from Mingary to Burra for the funeral.  He was born at Emu Downs 48 years ago, the son of Mr & Mrs John Heinrich.  He became a cowboy at Koonoona, then an ostler at a Broken Hill Hotel before going to Queensland as a shearersâ€™ cook, drover and horse breaker.  He enlisted when the Boer War came along.  On returning from South Africa he became manager of Winnininnie Run until the Great War when he again enlisted in the 3rd Light Horse [as Fred Hanley].  He saw service with the Camel Corps in Palestine till the war ended.  He then returned to Winnininnie.  Two years ago he purchased one of the Boolcoomatta Blocks and at the time of his death was on the way to success.  [Adolph Frederick Heinrich born 29 September 1874 at Emu Downs: died 18 June 1923 at Gum Well.]
