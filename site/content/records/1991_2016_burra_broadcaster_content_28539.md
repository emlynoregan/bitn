Letter.  Doug Wiltshire writes re Burra rates and expressing concern about the $800,000 budgeted for the Council’s office upgrade, with c. $460,000 spent to June 2002 – nor is there any sign of a feasibility study to support $1.5 million for capital expenditure on plant and equipment in 2000-01.  He is particularly concerned with why Burra ratepayers are charge so much more than others:

Burra township		0.771 cents in the dollar

Clare residential		0.481

Barossa residential		0.3775

Kapunda residential		0.5579

Unley			0.3675

Burnside		0.3174

Pt Adelaide-Enfield	0.470

Charles Sturt		0.4113
