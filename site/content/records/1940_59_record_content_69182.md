The Chairman, in answer to a question, said Burra’s rate last year was 3/5 in the £ on an assessed value of £60,489, yielding £10,323.  [Check figure.]

Spalding’s rate was 2/4 in the £ on an assessed value of £60,028 yielding £7,000.

Mr Perry said the rate this year would be 4/- in the £.  Council assets would have to be taken into account in any move.  Spalding would need more plant in order to manage the extra road mileage, but would be able to borrow more with extra wards.

Burra Council had stationed a plant at Booborowie in the past and there was notice of a motion to do so again.

P.N. Collins asked whether Spalding would raise the rates on the two wards.  Mr Trengove said he expected that the assessments would be likely to be raised, but in view of the lower rate the total payment would be about the same.

Mr Perry said Burra had applied for £5,000 for the Burra-Andrews Road, but had been reduced to £1,000 because priority was given to the Hanson Road by the Highways Department.

Mr Dewhirst said it seemed the Spalding Council could get money and the Burra Council could not.

Mr R. Banker or Barker? suggested that some part of Leighton Ward might prefer to stay with Burra and Mr R. Earle agreed because of its proximity.

Mr Pearce explained that if a change was favoured it would require a petition to the Governor with the signatures of a majority both in numbers and assessed values in each ward.

Only two dissented when a motion was put that the meeting favoured the transfer of Booborowie and all or such portion of Leighton Ward as shall be defined, to Spalding DC.
