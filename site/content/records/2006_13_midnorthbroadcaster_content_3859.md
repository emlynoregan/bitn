BCS recently had twelve students from the School of the Air at the school for three days.  These students see their itinerary teacher once a term and class teacher once a year.  The three day event allowed them to interact with other students their own age and to be active in subjects they donâ€™t normally get to do with other students, such as physical education, team sports and technical studies.  They came from Yunta, Olary and east of Burra.
