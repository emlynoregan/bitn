Obituary.  Murder-Suicide.  Alfred Lines, late of this town has shot his wife and Maurice O’Connor with whom she had eloped to Adelaide, before taking his own life.  Lines, though young was well known to police and has convictions for drunkenness and violence.  He boasted of his infidelities and is said to have profited by his wife’s shame.  It is little wonder she was willing to escape any way from his power.  Great sympathy is felt for the father and mother of Lines and O’Connor and for the friends of Mrs Lines.
