Letter complaining about the proposed by-laws - in particular about: -

X	4 m.p.h. speed limit around corners.  This is surely not necessary around all corners - some are hardly discernable in the grass of the outer parts of town.

XXIX	The distances cited are impossible or absurd.  60’ would be adequate.

XXI	This would prevent a farmer from selling a little extra produce without a licence and even for real hawkers it is an unnecessary restriction of trade.
