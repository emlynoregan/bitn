P. Le Vagueresse President of the Burra Baseball Club writes reporting a break-in at the Baseball Club as well â€“ for the second time in six months.  The club is not licensed and so the amount of damage done for a few soft drinks, a first aid kit, spade, shovel, posthole digger and circular saw, makes no sense.  The club will persevere and continue to offer clinics etc. in term 4.  The golf club has also been left with similar repair costs due to the same incident.
