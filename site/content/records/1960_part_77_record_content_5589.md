Grain Silos.  Tenders have been called for the erection of a 300,000 bushel silo at Farrell Flat.  A meeting of about 200 local wheat growers at Hanson on Wednesday failed to convince the Chairman of the Bulk Handling Board that Hanson was a more central point.  It is understood that growers in the Gum Creek-Farrell Flat area would fill the silo before growers further north and east would start reaping, as they are normally 2-3 weeks later.

After Farrell Flat, the next silo planned is at Pt Pirie with 16 cells.  It is expected erection of a complete coverage of silos throughout the state will take at least four years.
