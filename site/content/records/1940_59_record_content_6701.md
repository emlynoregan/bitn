Burra Town Council, 21 July

The Mayor reported he had sent information on empty houses in Burra to the Chairman of the Unemployment Relief Council.

Burra Electric Supply Co. said it would illuminate the streets on cloudy moonlight nights, but relied on the public to report lights not burning.

The Mayor and Cr Marston reported on the visit to Adelaide in connection with the Institute and it was resolved to hold a Ratepayers Meeting on 30 July to discuss the Council taking over the Institute.

Letter.  R.S. Bowles late Vice-President and acting Chairman of Burra Institute writes to clarify some points regarding the Institute’s affairs.

The sixty half-yearly payments of £102 in full settlement of the debt would involve the Council in finding about £10 p.a. because the £158 interest on the mortgage is met from Institute revenue and the Council would save its yearly rental payment of £36.

The total income for the Institute for the 12 months to 30 June 1940 (from the Library and hall rental) was £506.

The caretaker-librarian’s salary and mortgage interest absorbed c. £306 of this, leaving about £200 for purchase of books, heating, lighting, maintenance and repairs.

This has allowed for only the most urgent of repairs, but a fresh arrangement with Burra Talkies Proprietors will increase the income by £60 p.a.

The proposal now arranged by the Mayor to be put to the ratepayers could not, in my opinion, be bettered and if not accepted by them such an option might never be repeated.
