The Ah Chin Relief Fund is printed.  It lists over 230 contributors and raised a total of £37-0-3, including 16/3 from the Xmas Service at Redruth Methodist Church and £1-14-0 from an open-air concert by May’s Band.

[Leaving aside these two larger contributions, this would mean an average donation of about 3/-.]

Mrs Chin thanked all for their practical assistance and says by their united efforts she has been able to re-establish a home that was destroyed by fire.
