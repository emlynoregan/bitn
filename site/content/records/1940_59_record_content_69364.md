Brian Fahey aged 14 has been awarded a certificate of Merit by the Royal Humane Society for stopping a runaway horse and jinker at Willalo on 31 March 1954.  He is the son of Mr & Mrs T.J. Fahey of Willalo.  Maxine Deer was driving the jinker home from school with her brother Graham, Dianne Schliebs and Graham Clapp when the horse bolted.  Maxine and Graham fell out, but the others, both aged 5, remained in the jinker.  Brian Fahey chased it on his bicycle and was able to stop it.
