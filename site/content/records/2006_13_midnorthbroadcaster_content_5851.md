One alternative being used is fly-strike chips.  These are attached to the skin normally removed by mulesing and restrict the blood flow.  This causes the skin to wither.  It and the biodegradable chips then fall off in a couple of weeks.

[The process is named after J.H.W. Mules an Australian farmer who died in 1946.  A report in the Burra Record on its performance in 1943 at Mt Bryan rather suggests it was relatively new at that time.  Another in 1970 suggests its popularity grew rapidly in the late 1960s.]
