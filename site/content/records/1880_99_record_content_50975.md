Sparks: What people are asking

‘Is there a horse in Burra that can travel 17 miles an hour?’

[See the item immediately below.]

‘Is it true that a phonograph has been procured for “urgent business” in Burra?’

[Note that a phonograph could record as well as play, so perhaps the suggestion here relates to leaving one running in the Council Chamber – though with a maximum of 4 minutes running time it was an amusing rather than practical consideration.]

‘Why No. 2 Reserve was not inspected by the Parklands Committee according to the resolution passed at the meeting of the Council held on August 21?’
