A Strike!  The rules of the Booborowie Quadrille Assembly say there must be no ‘engaging’ before the dance.  Only when the MC calls ‘take your partners’ may the young men seek their partners.  A few nights ago the girls rebelled and demanded the right to make prior engagements for dances.  When the rules were enforced they all filed out of the hall and the dance had to be abandoned.  A mass meeting is to be held, where no doubt the ladies’ wishes will prevail.
