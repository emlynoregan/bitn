Burra Cheer-up Society

This continues to meet weekly and makes useful articles for the boys at the front.  A social farewell is tendered every lad on leaving and a presentation of a parcel of serviceable articles is made.  A welcome home is accorded every returned soldier.  Last year when celebrating Violet Day Burra Cheer-up Society raised £414 and a bunch of violets sold on the bugler system realised £384.  This year the special effort on 7 July raised £232-2-0.  Since starting nearly £2,000 in cash has been raised.
