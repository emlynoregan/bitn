Riverton-Jamestown Road Service.  Changes from Monday 4th inst.

[This is odd as 4 May was a Tuesday and 4 June a Friday.  In any case the changes elicited protests to the General Traffic Manager of the SAR, Mr F.B. Harvey, via local MP, G.S. Hawker.]

The parcel service will continue as before, being carried by goods train on Mondays, Wednesday s and Friday s departing Riverton 4 p.m. for Spalding, OR by road bus to Clare or Spalding to transfer to goods train for Barinia, Hilltown and Andrews.

Assurances are given re fruit and vegetables service similar to parcels service.

On Sundays the road bus will connect at Hamley Bridge to make the same connection as the rail car now does.

This is not a first step towards drastically reducing services on the line to Spalding.

Four employeesâ€™ houses will be vacated at Spalding and invalidity employees will be transferred to them.

Subsidiary mail services will be introduced to maintain deliveries.
