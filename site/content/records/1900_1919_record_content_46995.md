Burra Town Council.

After talking to Mr Winnall the Council has instructed him if necessary to accept service of a writ.

[E. Thamm was obviously having drainage problems and the Council Inspector seems to have been less than helpful.  This may have had something to do with Mr Thamm being thought by some people to have had pro-German sympathies, but nothing of that nature is hinted at in the paper.]

An old well near the Mine Bridge is to be filled in with rubbish.

A photograph of Mr Burns is being sought for the Council Chamber.

Cr Dane said he believed Burra was the only town in SA with sufficient subscribers for a continuous telephone service, but which had not one.

The department will be urged to rectify this at once.

The Postal Department will be urged to revert to the early morning closing of mails as was the former custom.

Cr Dane complained of the lack of a men’s waiting room at the station.

Sergeant Lackman, who had been manager for Elder, Smith & Co. for about three years, was given a banquet at the Cheer-up Hall by friends and former clients on Friday evening.  Mr Winnall presided.  Mr Hawkes & Mr Crewes, H.H. Thomas and Cr Radford all spoke warmly of Sgt Lackman and the report extends over 1½ columns.
