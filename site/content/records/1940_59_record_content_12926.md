Obituary.  Miss K. [Kathleen] Jean Williams died at the home of her parents Mr & Mrs T. Williams, ‘Buckland Hills’ near Ironmine, at the age of 23.  She was born at Jamestown on 28 December 1919 when her parents lived at Georgetown.  She was educated at Ayers Public School and lived at home until about 12 months ago when on account of her health she went to Glenelg.  She was apparently much better when she returned on 5 February, but was taken suddenly ill and died on the evening of 15 February.  She was actively involved with the Ironmine Church and Sunday School.
