Burra Town Council, 7 December

The first meeting of the new Council.

Local Government Dept advises that the Main Road Grant was fixed at £300 with another £150 to come from Council.  The rate subsidy will be £93, an increase of £25 on 1931.

D.A. Sampson asked permission to use certain of his property at the rear of Mr M. Morton’s blacksmith’s shop in Thames St as a poultry farm.  It would abut Bridge St on the other side.  The Town Clerk said he did not think the Central Board of Health would approve.  A decision was deferred pending investigation.

The Unemployment Relief Council wrote about subsidies for work.

The Mayor said he thought there were about 70 unemployed men in the town.

The offer of the Unemployment Relief Council was accepted.

Young People’s Unemployment Relief Committee offered advice on how their scheme worked finding jobs for the young.  Cr Bevan said the position was serious for lads leaving school and young girls too.  It was resolved that the Council resolve itself into a committee after Christmas to see what could be done for the young.

Cr Riggs asked if water pressure could be increased in the East Ward, as if fire broke out there was insufficient pressure to extinguish it.

The Mayor said that some time ago the Department had put down new pipes, but insufficient had come to do East Ward.  The Engineer-in-Chief will be asked to improve services in Kingston & Blyth Streets.

The Town Clerk said the financial position was better than for last year.

The Mayor’s allowance was fixed at £20.

The sides of the main road are to be attended to from near the Kooringa Post office to R. Fuss’s residence.
