Local Board of Health.

Cr Wicklein asked why the Hospital septic tank had not been attended to.  Notice had been served.

The delay was that Mr Thomson (Chairman) would not have alterations made without consulting with the authorities.

The Town Clerk said it was affecting his familyâ€™s health and he would personally write to the Central Board of Health if action were not taken.
