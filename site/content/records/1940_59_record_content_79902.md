The enrolment in February was 85 – 42 boys and 43 girls; an all time record enrolment.  Average attendance has been 76.  At the end of 1956 Mr Burdon, Mr eer [sic: for J. Deer] and Mr Pillar were promoted and transferred.  They were replaced by Messrs Morrison, Bawden and Ireland.

Last year’s exam results in Intermediate and Leaving were very good.  Six of eight Intermediate candidates gained certificates and all five Leaving candidates got certificates.  In Intermediate Valmai Williams was outstanding with 7 subjects and two credits.  In Leaving Robert Bourman passed six subjects with one credit.  This year a record sixteen sat for the Intermediate and three sat for Leaving.

Sporting facilities at the school are readily available and all members of the staff join with students at their play.  I would like to extend woodwork and Home Science, but teacher shortages prevent that at present.  Instruction in dancing has been included this year and the results were seen at the last High School Ball.

The Annual Sports Day was held at the Racecourse Oval.  Cup winners were:

Senior Boys’ Cup	Barry Eberhard

Senior Girls’ Cup	Marie Eberhard

Junior Girls’ Cup	Judith Field

Junior Boys’ Cup	John Sibly

This year Burra hosted the Mid-Northern High School Sports at the Racecourse Oval and the event was a great success, even though Burra finished a sorry last in the points list.

Once again the Parents and Friends’ Association has provided the school with many amenities and catered for lunches, afternoon teas etc. on Sports Day and will organise the annual High School Banquet tomorrow.

The High School Council has had another successful year and thanks go to Chairman H.J.B. Jennison, Secretary Mr G.H. Cockrum and Treasurer, S.J. Woollacott.  Thanks to its efforts the Minister of Education has assured us that an additional two classrooms will be built at the school and be ready for the opening of the 1958 school year.  These are needed because at present we have to use the Library and Woodwork Centre as class rooms.  Thanks go to the District Council for levelling the area for the new rooms.  The old building is now being painted.

In April the school went to Adelaide for the SA Exhibition at the Wayville Showgrounds.  The Leaving Geography Class visited the Barossa Valley as part of their course.  The school had an excellent display at the Burra Show.  The annual High School Ball raised £90 for the Parents & Friends’ Funds.  During the year most students received vaccinations against poliomyelitis and tuberculosis.

[The Prize List is printed.]

The guest speaker for the evening was Hon. R.R. Wilson MLC for the Northern District.  Mr Wilson urged boys and girls to stay on at school, pointing out the advantages of a good education in days of progressive competition when seeking a job.  He also stressed the need for charity all through the year.

Mr Jennison as Chair of the High School Council thanked Mr Wilson.  After an interval the evening continued with a concert program, which is reported in ½ column.
