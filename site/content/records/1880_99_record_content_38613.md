Editorial on the Municipal Corporations Bill and the Legislative Council’s rejection of rate assessments on unimproved land values.  It seems that this clause is preventing the passage of 411 other clauses, most of which are advantageous.  If the Council remains implacable we believe the Bill should pass without this clause rather than see the whole thing shelved yet again.

2nd Leader continues the fight between the Record and the Barrier Miner which grew out of the free trade versus protection debate and had become rather personal.  The Miner’s tone can be judged from: ‘Down at Burra there appears at certain spasmodic intervals a neatly printed paper’, while the Record’s tone can be seen in ‘God forgive the Miner for its deliberate lies’.

Locusts are about in tremendous swarms.

Snakes are very common now.

Ironmine Primitive Methodist Church was the site of a successful entertainment last Thursday.  The Ironmine Brass Band played selections before the concert.

Baldina Irrigation Scheme.  There has been no action on this despite favourable noises from the Playford Government when its policy was announced.

The wool clip this year looks good: thick and heavy, though the shearing has been slowed by very wet weather.

Advt.  Redruth Wesleyan Sunday School Anniversary is on 9 Nov.  Rev. T.M. Rowe and Rev. R.M. Hunter will preach and the service of song ‘Little Nell’ will be presented.  Picnic on Monday 10 November (Public Holiday) near Sod Hut and a tea meeting in the evening.
