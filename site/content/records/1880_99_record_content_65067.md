Editor on Tonight’s Ratepayers’ Meeting.

The ratepayers meet tonight to evaluate the year’s activities.  All has been carried out satisfactorily and the Mayor’s report is published giving the facts and figures.  The big question that arises is that of the Waterworks.  The Government has been asked to reduce both the capital and interest charges, but only a feeble attempt has been made to respond to repeated requests.  The interest offered for a new lease has been dropped from 5% to 4%, but the capital is unchanged.  The offer to the Council is little short of an insult.  The comments in the offer re late payments were offensive.  Payments in the last 14 years have not been late.  We have paid an exorbitant rate of interest for many years.  There is only one thing now to be done: to allow the Government to take over the works so they can see that all is not golden.  The slowness of the Government’s response also deprives us of time to consider the matter properly.  A timely reply would have allowed us time to expound a better scheme.  Council must tell us tonight the true position of affairs.  Has the Government to power to fix a higher rate or not.  It must be borne in mind that before long a new reservoir will be needed and a new pumping plant so prospects are not good.  To keep supply up now pumping goes on at ridiculous hours.  It is the work of slavery to keep the tank on the hill filled.  Even though the works have been erected for 14 years not a penny has been struck off for depreciation.  The Government chooses for obvious reasons to overlook this important fact.  From the start the charges on capital have been excessive and reductions now would only be fair.

The Mayor’s Report.

The year opened with a debt of £8-10-5.  At present there is a credit of £63-12-7, most of which will be expended by the end of the year.

The assessment gave a rateable value a little lower than for 1897 and the general rate was reduced from 11d to 9d.

The assessment for 1899 is £87 less than for 1898 at £8,548.

In 1898 the North Ward lamp cost £5-15-6 and the lamps in the other two wards cost £4-17-6 each.
