Cycling.  Throughout the year there had been a number of humorous articles reporting on men training for the Anzac sports and then races with the Burra Cycling & Athletic Club.  One long running series of comments followed the training and supposed interaction of Ralph Hill with his coach Cec. Opie of the Kooringa Hotel.  The following tall story seems to be the culmination of the series to this point.

Worlds’ End to Johnny Green Cycling Record

The utmost secrecy has been maintained concerning the attempt by Ralph Hill on the above record and it was no surprise that only a few officials and press representatives were present when Ralph set off at midnight on Saturday.  As previously stated the travelling café of Tom Harrop is journeying with the record breaker to enable facilities for refreshment to be taken without the rider dismounting.  The rider, as is his custom, refused to be pushed off and made his start under his own power, and kept right on Tom’s wheel for the first half mile when a bat, blinded by the cyclist’s electric light, which was now generating 250 volts, struck the unfortunate rider in the eye.  Ralph, who thought Tom had thrown a pie back at him, dashed up to the café la movable and abused Tom until he was convinced of his error, because of his actions in the meantime Ralph had run 20 minutes behind schedule and Tom had to use the whip on Dobbin to keep up to Ralph for the next ten minutes.

Disaster again befell the rider at the Gorge crossing, where Ralph alleges someone had strewn tacks on the roadway with intent to puncture his tyres, and their action had the intended result.  As Tom had become used to being somewhat in the lead he took no notice of the non-appearance of Ralph for some minutes, coming out of the creek, and unfortunately carried on his spare tube.  In the meantime Hill had removed the tube and had walked up the creek to find a pool to find the puncture.  He blew the tube up slightly and placed it under the water and while awaiting the moon to appear from behind a cloud to spot the bubbles a crayfish nipped the tube clean in halves.  Ralph certainly let go more hot air than did the tube, but it was of no avail to the delay.  Upon returning to his cycle he found that someone had removed his three-speed gear arrangement, which meant in any case he could not have peddled up out of the creek.  He then made towards a nearby homestead to ring up Tommy Halls to bring down the necessary equipment when a bull put him up a tree where he spent the night in knickers, athletic singlet and much fear.

In the meantime Harrop had returned to find Ralph only to see a racing cycle lying in the creek minus the front wheel and other equipment.  After searching for Ralph with a hurricane lantern until daylight Tom decided to come to Burra and report the matter, but before anything had happened in the way of a search party going out, Ralph arrived by car suffering from the flu.  Cec. Opie gave him two rums and put him to bed, but it is doubtful whether he will be fit to continue on the record ride for at least a week.  His trainer is certainly disappointed, but is confident of success on the next attempt.
