Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting.  All the Council was on the platform.

The Mayor’s Report.

Though there is presently a credit balance of £18-1-9, amounts due before the year’s end will result in a deficit.  Much of the difficulty has been due to unemployment in the town for which some relief has been necessary.  H. F.W. Holder has helped by sending a number of men to work at the Gumbowie waterworks and the crowds of idle men on street corners have ceased to exist.  In 1894 a bond of £200 and a coupon of £40 have been cleared off, £291-11-9 has been spent in public works.  Rent of the office cost £6-5-0 and lamp lighting £16-7-0: for a total of £554-3-9.  Rates have yielded £446-11-2 and the Government grant-in-aid £116-18-6: total £563-9-8.

Incidentals and salaries have been obtained from sources other than the rates.  In three years the bonded debt will be extinguished and the whole of our income will be available for current expenses rather than so much going to pay off old debts.

[Note that the lamp in North Ward cost £5-17-0.

The lamps in East Ward cost £5-5-0, but that ‘s’ must be an error.

The lamp in West Ward cost £5-5-0.

The north end lamp was at Tiver’s corner and in the south one was in Market Square, but the other’s place is uncertain.  The Kingston St Bridge was a later site and so was the Commercial St Bridge area.]

The show was a great success and Cr Harris has undertaken to provide funds for a pavilion at the oval without interest for five years.  But it should be borne in mind that income from the oval this year has been £2-2-0 and expenditure £49-5-7.

The Cemetery account shows a credit of £54-11-7.

Waterworks.  Assessment in 1888 was £12,132 and in 1893 was £9,578.

The rates brought in £489-17-10.  Interest on the lease was £406-2-2 and the engineer was paid £132.

The Local Board of Health reported no major problems for the year.

Cr Walsh then spoke of his two years as a Councillor overseeing works in the North Ward to see them done economically and judiciously.  At the start of his term the ward had a deficit of £14 when Cr Rabbich retired.  There was a credit of £2 at the end of last year and now there was a debit of £11, due mainly to relief work, though the recent extraordinary election had cost £4.  Councillor Walsh then ‘blamed’ Mr Rabbich for bringing Mr Hardy out for the election and canvassing for him.

Mr Rabbich: ‘It’s an untruth.’  If he had time he would contest the election.

In the recent unpleasantness about the Waterworks engineer Cr Walsh thought it his duty to demand an enquiry.  Had he been guilty I would have been the first to say ‘send him going at once’ the Councillor said.  Cr Walsh was of the opinion that an expert from Adelaide should be got to find the irregularities so much spoken of.  He was thanked by acclamation.

Cr West then briefly spoke of his two years, saying he had always worked with honesty and straightforwardness.

Cr Parks thought it unnecessary to go into details after the Mayor’s report.  He had started the year as Chairman of Public Works, but without an overseer had found it too time consuming and resigned.  He was sorry about any friction that occurred.  The greatest concern was over the Waterworks.  He believed that Cr Harris and Cr Sampson were justified in their steps.  ‘Councillor Walsh seems to reflect on the way in which the matter was dealt with.  The charge was not one of drunkenness.’

The Mayor: ‘Yes, certainly it was.’

Cr Parks: ‘No, it wasn’t.’

Mr W. Killicoat: ‘Yes it was one of drunkenness and you know it.  You have been the cause of nearly all the irritation in the Council.’

Uproar ensued and the East Ward Councillor had to appeal to the chair to restore order.

‘The Mayor: . . . Councillor Harris went to the Town Clerk and tried to rake up things that occurred six years ago.’

Uproar.

‘Cr Harris: That’s lies, lies, lies.'
