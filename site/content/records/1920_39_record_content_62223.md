Burra Baby Clinic

Since their inception in 1934 the CWA Younger Set have done many philanthropic acts and have been most active in promoting mother and child welfare, through supporting the Baby Health Train and other actions.

Matron G. Siegele of Burra Hospital has also been a keen supporter of baby care and about three years ago undertook an intensive course of training in Sydney, returning to Burra almost a year ago and she has since worked towards establishing a Baby Clinic at the Burra Hospital.

Space was available at the Maternity Wing and the CWA Younger Set undertook to be responsible for the cost of equipment.  Last Friday they handed over a cheque for £25-3-0 with other gifts.  The State and Local President of the CWA Mrs I.J .Warnes attended, with the local Secretary Miss Minnie Rogers, the President of the Younger Set Miss Bernice Potter, the Secretary Miss Molly Walker and other members and young mothers.  Mrs Warnes thanked all who had made the new clinic possible and she also spoke of the good work of the Baby health Train.  Miss Potter said they had rather expected to have to find more than £25-3-0 to honour their commitment, but Matron Siegele’s skills in crafts etc. had reduced the anticipated costs considerably.  Matron Siegele acknowledged all the help and the donations from many, which had kept costs down.  She said the popularity of the clinic was proved by the register with 330 visits recorded.
