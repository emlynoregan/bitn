The Burra Burra Mine [Editorial]

The half-yearly report of the SA Mining Association covers the period to 30 September last.  In that period 6,183 tons of ore was raised with an average of about 23% copper.  This is within 121 tons of the quantity raised in the previous half-year and 459 tons more than the corresponding period of the preceding year.  On 31 March there were 4,715 tons of ore on hand.  This with the ore raised in the last half-year totals 10,899 tons.  [Well 10,898 tons!]

Of this 4,227 tons have been delivered to the English & Australian Copper Company, leaving a balance on hand of 6,672 tons.   Smelted copper on hand at the end of September was 176 tons.  Since then the Copper Co. has delivered 546 tons to make a total of 722 tons.  Of this 551 tons has been sold in the colony and 80 tons have been exported, leaving 90 tons on hand.  The price of copper sold in the colony has ranged from £95 to £105 per ton, with an average of £98-12-3.  The cost of raising 5,724 tons of ore referred to in the first financial statement of the report was £12-4-4 per ton and the proceeds averaged £15-6-1 per ton, leaving a profit of £3-1-9 per ton.    This is a smaller average profit than previously due to the large expenditure in exploratory work, the increasing depth of the Mine and a slight fall in the price of copper.  The nett profit on the sale of this ore amounted to £17,678, which added to the balance at the date of the last report, say £60,481, together with £614 from rents etc. makes a total to the end of March last, divisible among the shareholders, of £78,773.  Out of this the 34th and 35th dividends have been paid, leaving a nett ascertained balance of divisible profits of £54,133.  This it is expected will be augmented to at least £77,778, but more probably to £92,133 when the ore and copper now on hand is sold and the nett return on copper now in transit has been ascertained.  The values of the produce on hand and in transit have been estimated upon the last quoted price of copper in London.  The August mail advised this was £107-10-0 per ton.  This is the lowest price for some time and the Directors have every reason to hope that the larger sum mentioned above will be available for distribution.  The Directors have declared a dividend of £5 per share [100%] will be paid on 1 December and 2 March next.

Captain Roach reported that a great deal of new ore ground has been opened in the last few months and the pitches are generally looking well.  In driving the fifty fathom east from Waterhouse’s Shaft a lode of malachite of the richest sort and eight feet wide has been encountered.  Other shafts are being sunk and efforts made to prosecute the work more vigorously.  In the last two months 2,070 tons of ore were raised.  Another large pumping engine has arrived at Port Adelaide.

Although promising, the mines at Karkulto, near Black Springs and at Pompurne near Clare, are not yet producing much ore.  The company is employing 1,064 people: 1,026 at Burra, 26 at Karkulto and at Pompurne and Adelaide, 12.  At the last half-yearly meeting we noted that J.B. Graham, who was visiting the colony from Frankfurt, had been made a Director.  On leaving for Europe he resigned that position and at an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders Mr J. Hector was elected in his place.
