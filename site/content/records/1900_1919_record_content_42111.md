Burra Institute.  Condolences were sent to Mrs Sangster on the death of Dr Sangster Jun.

Specifications for a fire-proof room for the biograph lantern were adopted.

Subscribers number 129.

Mr Drew suggested a general meeting of subscribers be called to discuss the idea of a billiard room as it seemed impossible to get a full meeting of the committee.

A general meeting has been called.  The committee recommends a room with one table.

Volunteers.  Add the name of A.C. McWaters.
