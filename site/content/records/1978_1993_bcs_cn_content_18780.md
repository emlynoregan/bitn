411th Regional Cadet Unit

Parent support is needed at the Parent Fundraising Committee meetings.  While support has been obtained when volunteers are needed, it has been lacking at committee meetings.  To keep the unit going requires a minimum of about $2,500 p.a.  Due to a low bank balance it was decided to charge a subscription this term.  Since then there has been a substantial decline in cadet numbers.  If insufficient people attend the next meeting to form a committee, discuss a constitution and consider future fundraising subscriptions will have to increase with a foreseeable further decline in cadet numbers and perhaps the collapse of the unit.  I would not like either of these outcomes, but a club of this size cannot be run by the three officers alone, which you seem to expect.

The next meeting is at 7 p.m. on 20 June in the old Courthouse.

President of the Parent Fundraising Committee, Ken White.
