Ron Dewhirst writes with some comments and suggestions about local football:

Years ago we had the formation of Junior Football and over recent years it seems that an ‘in between’ grade is required, but owing to lack of numbers this won’t work.  It could be overcome by having a ‘B’ Grade, which would have no age limits, which appears to be the stumbling block for the present Colts (changed from Juniors).

From the spectator point of view the present six A Grade teams can hardly be considered a great success.  My suggestion is four A Grade and 4 B Grade teams.  Burra, Hallett, Spalding and Booborowie could field A Grade teams.  It seems that Leighton can only function with the assistance of players from other areas and has never had the numbers for a Junior team.

The season would comprise five rounds and two Association matches.

Booborowie would call its B Grade team Leighton – the surplus from Booborowie.

Hallett would call its B Grade team Mt Bryan with the surplus from Hallett’s Redlegs.

Burra would call its B Grade team Redlegs with the surplus from Burra A.

Leighton Oval could be shared with Booborowie Oval.

[He continues of in some detail of where games would be played, the timing of both grades’ matches and some rules about the exclusion of A Grade players from B Grade for finals etc.]
