A Note from the Publishers expresses apologies for a smaller size of the paper than was intended.  They considered deferring the first issue due to difficulties experienced, but decided to publish a slightly smaller issue.  [It was five columns wide instead of six.]

Editorial.  Inaugural

It has often been a matter of surprise that a local paper has never been started in Burra.  In the palmy days of the Mine from 1846 to 1852 the population was large and thriving, but of a different class from that now included in the district.  At the time there were no provincial papers in SA and not more than three papers in Adelaide.  But times have changed greatly and several important towns in the colony have had one or even two newspapers for years.  It is difficult to explain why Burra has lagged behind ‘but even if there has hitherto been any serious impediment to the starting of a local paper, we venture to think that the important changes which, during the past three years, have taken place in the district, have removed any such impediment, and that the time has arrived for establishing a journalistic organ of our own.’

We think that a town with its own Council ought to support a newspaper.  Indeed a respectably conducted newspaper ought to add as much to the status of a town as a Council does.  Our intention is not to trumpet Burra’s fame to the world.  In fact the most brilliant period of Burra’s history is a thing of the past, but there are today indications of steady improvement, giving hopes of a brighter future than seemed possible a few years ago.
