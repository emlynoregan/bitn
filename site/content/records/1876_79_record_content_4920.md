Burra Town Council. 
The Govt. suggests the installation of public fountains with the cost to be defrayed by a small water rate. The Mayor said a supply was needed for teamsters and it was a question of the method. The scheme should be endorsed if not too expensive. A letter was sent to enquire the probable cost of a supply to Market Square and Paxton Square.

Mr P. Murphy was elected sexton and gardener of the cemetery.
