The National Bank celebrated its centenary last month.  It has had a branch in Burra for 99 years.  It established itself in Burra in 1859, before it had a branch in Perth, Brisbane, Sydney or London.  The Adelaide Board of the bank decided on 1 April 1859 to send two directors to Kooringa to make arrangements for opening a branch.  They procured ‘small but neat premises’ from Mr Joseph Parker for a three-year lease at £120 and they advertised that the branch would open on 25 April with Mr R.G. Prole as manager, at a salary of £300 p.a. with quarters in the bank premises.  He arrived with an iron safe, sovereigns and banknotes.  He offered security for the town’s money and interest on miners’ savings and overdrafts for those who were waiting for harvests etc.  The bank identified itself with the district interests and while some banks in SA declined to lend money to farmers, the National encouraged wheat growers and pastoralists, who grew in importance as the mine declined.  The first account in 1859 was opened by Gebhardt Pfanner, a musician and another was opened by the ‘German and English Burial Club’.  The bank later moved from its rented premises and erected a solid two storey structure in the best nineteenth century manner, with stables for horses – needed for the manager making calls on customers living out of town.
