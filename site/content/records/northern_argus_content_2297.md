The Bon Accord Mine Site & Museum is entered for a Regional Tourism Award.

Owned by the Burra Branch of the National Trust, the ‘Bon’ received some $30,000 from the Jubilee 150 Board last year and the Burra National Trust branch added a further $19,000 so that the building could be restored and displays installed.  Visitors today can see the 300 foot Bon Accord shaft, from which Burra drew its water supply for many years.  The Bon Accord Mining Co.’s lease bordered that of the SA Mining Association’s hugely successful Burra Burra Mine.  The Bon Accord buildings were completed in 1859, but despite all efforts no deposit of copper was found.  There is yet 100 years of waterworks history to be discovered at the ‘Bon’ and some archaeological studies are yet to be undertaken.  It has just been announced that the ‘Bon’ has received a Community Development grant of almost $20,000 to ensure that work continues for some time.  The site is on the register of State Heritage Items and is registered by the National Trust of SA.  The Bon accord Mine Engineer’s Workshop is also on the State heritage Register and classified by the National Trust.  The Bon Accord residence and pumphouse is registered by the National Trust.
