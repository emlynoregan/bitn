Girl Guides have been busy with activities including:

A camp in Adelaide over Easter

A swimming carnival at the local pool.

Replacing signs on the Heysen Trail between the Redruth Gaol and Burra Cemetery.

Juniors have been cooking, swimming, making photo frames for Mother’s Day and participating in Clean Up Australia.  And have also had a visit to Burra Police Station.

This week is National Biscuit Week – one of two similar fundraising biscuit sales in the year – the other being in October.

Gumnuts did similar activities and also did craftwork.
