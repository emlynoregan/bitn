Redruth Court, 12 August.

Edward Williams was fined 5/- for driving around the corner of Kingston St and Paxton Terrace.

[This is interesting, since the two streets named do not meet and run approximately parallel!]

George Parks was charged with embezzling the Burra Burra Lodge MUIOOF.

J.R. Anderson for the defence and J.E.H. Winnall prosecuted.

The charge of embezzling £22-11-1 was withdrawn.

He was further charged with embezzling other moneys received from persons who had paid off several amounts of interest.  Evidence of the payment of such moneys from John Wise, Ambroze Edwards and Mrs H. Mills for Henry Mills was tendered.  William Davey as trustee of the Lodge said he could find in the books no record of the receipt of these sums.

When he took possession of the books and cash from Mr Winnall he found in the safe and the office £27 in cash and had received some money since.  Several sums were lying around the office carelessly.  Mr Parks banked at the end of the last quarter and as a matter of fact then paid in £5 too much.  The Lodge by-law did not specify when the money had to be banked, but the amounts in the information had been neither banked nor entered in the cashbook.  Some sick pay had been paid in cash contrary to the request of the Lodge, which asked that all sick payments be by cheque.  The £27 found did not match the amount missing.  The deficit was £136-2-1.

Amounts paid in sick pay appear to have been £11-4-8.

Mr Winnall submitted there was a prima facie case and asked that the prisoner be committed for trial.

Mr Anderson admitted gross carelessness, but said they had failed to show the prisoner had feloniously stolen any money and appropriated it to his own use, as required by law.

There was no law requiring him to bank the money by any particular date.  This was odd and should immediately be altered, but that was how it stood.  At the last audit he had actually banked more money than he had received.  He attributed the prisoner’s position to gross carelessness and agreed he was not fit to hold the position and the trustees should have dismissed him when they found he was not giving the attention to his duty that was required.  When he was arrested it was for not banking £22-11-1.  Mr Davey admitted there was money all over the shop in a very loose manner.  He asked for a dismissal.

On being recalled Mr Davey said that on 30 July with Mr Snell he went to Mr Park’s house and told him they wanted the books and cash of the Lodge.  He refused and said he would go to the office after dinner and pay all the moneys into the bank before 3 o’clock.  Neither happened.

Mr Snell gave further evidence over the handling of sick pay.

After a consultation the Bench committed the prisoner for trial at the Criminal Sittings in Adelaide about 5 October and allowed bail of £400 with two sureties of £200.

He was further charged with embezzling several small amounts paid to the Lodge by members, which appeared on the cards, but were not accounted for.

J.E.H. Winnall, acting for the trustees had requested of the prisoner all books, moneys and keys.  The prisoner had given up the keys of the safes, but retained that of the office, promising to hand over everything in the morning and he would bank all money before 12 o’clock on Saturday 1 August.  He failed to do so and a warrant was issued for his arrest.  He was committed for trial on this charge too.
