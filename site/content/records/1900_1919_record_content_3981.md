Public Meeting.  A meeting of taxpayers called as requested by the Mayor, E.W. Crewes, had a reduced attendance at the Institute on Friday, due to the rain: a thunderstorm producing torrents at 7 p.m.  Similar meetings at other towns were forwarding requests to Parliament for a reduction in the cost of Government.  Crewes strongly supported this move.  As much work previously done by the State Parliament was now a federal responsibility this seemed an obvious opportunity to cut costs, but the present Government was doing nothing in this direction.

W.G. Hawkes moved and T. Best 2nd:

‘This meeting of the taxpayers of Burra and district views with alarm the serious cost of maintaining both Houses of the State Parliament at their present strength notwithstanding the reductions promised on the eve of Federation, and while not desiring to lay down the lines on which reductions should be made insists on a substantial reduction in the numerical strength of both Houses during the present session.’

Mr Radford urged a stronger resolution.

Mr Hardy moved an amendment to the effect that representation be reduced by one half in both Houses and the Ministry to four members at a salary of £800 p.a., but this failed to be 2nd.  The motion was carried unanimously.

J.E.H. Winnall moved that the Mayor communicate the resolution just passed to all members representing the district and urging the necessity of dealing with these reductions in the present session.  Carried.

J. McLaren moved that members be careful that any such reduction not give country districts a less proportion than at present.  Carried.
