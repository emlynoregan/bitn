Burra Waterworks.  It is a long time since the system has been extended, but now pipes are being laid in Thames and other streets.  It had been thought the reservoir would not cater for expansion, but we now know the problem lay with the pump and as this has been made more powerful expansion is possible and will be lucrative, as in many cases the water will not be used, but will be charged for.  The aim is to extend water to all streets.
