Burra Bowling Club

Big scale improvements are planned following a bequest from the late E.F. Marston, through which the grounds were purchased.  Negotiations in hand will allow the club to buy additional land for improvements.

From the Thames street side the club will remove the large pine trees and replace them with candle pines and lawn along the footpath edge.

A north-south fence beginning at the Council Depot block with a 10 ft gate and a smaller one for a side entrance will be erected.  It will be cyclone and will run part of the way into Bridge Street with an appropriate corner gate memorial to E.F. Marston.  This will be of brick and stone construction with a wrought iron gate and archway.

Fencing nearly completed on the south, east and bottom end of the north side will be of paling construction to provide a wind break.

The croquet green (with extra land) will be converted into four full length rinks for lady associates.

Two new rinks will be added to the north side of the present seven to give a total of 13 rinks.

The club house will be improved by almost doubling the width of the side verandah and enclosing it with a low concrete wall and louvres or sliding glass panels, for use as an afternoon tea area.

Recently boarding around the green has been renewed and water piping installed.

Shaded seats around the area will be paid for by money raised last year by the Lady associates.
