The Local Board of Health, 21 May

The Medical Officer and the Health Inspector have made adverse reports on the Bacon Factory Slaughter Yards.  Both complained that the carcases of slaughtered pigs in an advanced state of decay were lying close to the slaughter house.  The carcases have since been burnt.  They also reported no improvement in the smell from the factory.  It was resolved to write to the factory stating that if the instructions formerly issued by the board were not carried out within 14 days, the factory would be closed.*  Cr Harvey asked if the factory had Council permission to make bacon.  The Mayor said the place had first been a freezing works and had approval for the manufacture of small goods.  He did not know if the licence covered bacon.  It was then resolved that a letter be sent stating that no work other than that allowed by the Corporation Licence was to be carried out on the premises.

Carried on the casting vote of the Mayor: Crs Kellaway, Bevan and Carpenter being opposed and Crs Harvey, Lee and Fisher in favour.

It has since been decided to hold a special meeting of the Board tonight to discuss the matter.

[*In the next issue, No. 22, 5 June 1945, page 1, this was corrected to say that if the instructions were not carried out within 14 days, further action would be taken by the Local Board of Health.]
