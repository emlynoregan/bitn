Absentees & Their Families

[There is a long editorial on the problems caused by the mass movement of men to the goldfields.  It begins by hoping that the recently passed Act will be successful in saving the colony from ruin.  The article does not make clear what this Act is or does, but it was the Bullion Act.  The main thrust of the article concerns the problems created when departing diggers left families unprovided for.  The writer foresaw huge problems because by this time ship were taking 700 to 800 a week and vast numbers were now taking the overland route.  Since it was safe to assume that while some would meet with success, many would not.  Those leaving now were ignoring the advice to wait for the break of season when water would be available.  A rapid increase in the numbers in desperate need of assistance was to be expected.  The resolution that the Destitute Board would not aid families of men at the digging would have to be abandoned.  The Government would also have to make arrangements for an overland escort for conveying gold to Adelaide.]
