Burra Golf Club held its AGM 9 November.  Elected: President, D.R. Kempster; Vice-Presidents, I. Allen & A. Baulderstone; Treasurer, S. Allen; Secretary, H. Burnett; Captain, P. Dignan and Vice-Captain, A. McFarlane.

Retiring President R.E. Mason reported a successful year with a slight increase in membership.  The team was successful in the Mid North Pennant Competition, having moved from bottom of the ladder to the top in three years.

The open day was a great success in perfect weather.  We can look forward next year to great changes in the club with proposed reorganising and expanding of the whole course.  We will be fortunate to have a top class golf course for 1973.
