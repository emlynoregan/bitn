Ratepayers’ Meeting, Burra Institute 26 November.  About 40 people attended.

The Mayor read his report which was adopted.

The Town Clerk they would end the year in credit about £100.

There were questions about charges improperly made on stock impounded in unregistered pounds.

The Mayor said if a mistake had been made money should be refunded.

Cr Hammond thanked ratepayers for his uncontested re-election.

Cr Woollacott said he had opposed the new assessment, but was now in favour with the rate at 3/- instead of 3/6.  It would bring in an extra £500.  He thanked ratepayers for his re-election.

The Mayor said that everyone knew that land worth £5 five years ago was now worth £10.

Cr Kellaway said he was standing for re-election.  He favoured the foundation of a progress committee.

Mr Crewes said he was standing for East Ward.  He approved of the playground, but not a 99 year lease to a private tennis club which violated the privileges of the ratepayers.  He thought the road to the cemetery should be a main road.

Cr Hammond said he did not like to hear a candidate saying ‘I am the great I am’.  The men in the Council could carry on without Mr Crewes.  (The rest of the remarks were lost in a roar of laughter.)

The Mayor said the Council had been promised a public telephone at the station last Thursday and a cabstand.

Cr Kellaway said there was no chance of increasing the main roads – it was a struggle to keep the present ones on the schedule.
