The fund will also benefit from the Muff Football Match on 30 June at which J. Gallagher has paid for the expenses of the Terowie Band to attend.  Two guessing competitions are also being run.

See R.D. Pascoeâ€™s window for a candle and a jar of beans.

Also guess the weight of a sheep at the football.
