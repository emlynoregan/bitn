Boy Scouts.  Having lost their room in the fire at the White Hart in March, they thank Mr Sedgman of the Waterworks for a large room in which to store equipment etc.  The room will now become their headquarters.  The scouts recently got a letter from Fred Fuller, who is on the training ship HMAS Tingira.
