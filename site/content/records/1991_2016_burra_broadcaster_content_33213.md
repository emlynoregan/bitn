Farrell Flat Uniting Church will hold its closing service next Sunday at 10.30 a.m.

The original church was the Hanson Wesleyan Church, dating from 1878.  In 1934 this was demolished and a new church was built on its foundations.  Power and lights were installed in 1954 and a Sunday school room was added at the back in 1956.  An old Housing Trust room was added in 1963 and this in turn was replaced in 1963 with an Atco style building.  The property will be sold.
