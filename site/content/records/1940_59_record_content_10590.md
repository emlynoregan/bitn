Sgt Brian Riggs RAAF writes from England.  [Extracts from a long letter extend for about 2 columns.]

Left Bournemouth and went to London and booked a sleeper to Scotland.  In London took in Piccadilly, Trafalgar Square, Buckingham Palace, Westminster Cathedral and the National Gallery.  Arrived in Glasgow to find snow feet deep.  Unable to get to planned destination of Langil Castle.  Their hostess, Mrs McDonald directed them to her father’s home near Glasgow – Sir John Maxwell.  In peace time 60 to 70 people were employed working around the house alone.  Sir John casually referred to the Australian Governor General as an ‘old school pal, Old Sandy Gowrie’.

Next day left for the castle – train to Wemyss Bay and boat to Larbet, then five miles by car, another boat and finally a rowing boat and they were still about nine miles from the castle, with the roads blocked by snow.  Walked about three miles in foot-deep snow before staying over night at a homestead.   Eventually reached the castle after going part of the way by car and walking the rest.  Arrived in time for lunch.  The castle had dozens of rooms.  Mrs McDonald works in the fields till sundown and then dresses for dinner, so one can obtain a glimpse of the pre-war lady.  Capt. McDonald was in France at the start of the war and lost a leg.  He undertakes what work he can with an artificial leg, but his wife has to attend to much of it.

[Brian goes on to talk about keeping the cows and sheep – the former indoors in winter, but the latter outside all the year.  He also writes of visiting other farms.]

Returned to London via Glasgow.  Had a day there and visited the Tower of London and St Paul’s Cathedral.  They returned to their post and visited Christchurch and also Southampton – extensively damaged by bombing.
