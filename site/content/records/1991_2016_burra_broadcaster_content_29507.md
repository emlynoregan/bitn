Redruth Camp Centre Closes

A service was held on 17 November to mark the closure of the Redruth Camp Centre.  People from Burra Uniting Church and from Farrell Flat and Booborowie gathered to witness its closing after 30 years.  Among the visitors who had been actively involved over the years were Neil & Debbie Brown, Harold & Sandra Bailey and Ian & Jenny Denton.  Rod Peppiatt conducted the service.  The centre was inaugurated in 1972 and served as a retreat and a camp centre for church and school groups.  The Tiddy-oggy Tearooms were another part of the story in the former Courthouse Hotel.  Up to 80 could be accommodated there when other facilities were full.  There were good catering facilities on either side of the road.  Rod Peppiatt highlighted the service given by Helen McColl for more than 20 years as manager-caretaker.  The Uniting Church is considering options for the disposal of the asset.  The Courthouse Hotel site could be converted to three flats.  The rest of the complex comprises three sites: the Redruth Church, the managerâ€™s residence and the Camp Centre, formerly the Sunday-school building.
