George Hiles was charged by Joseph Barrett with assaulting him.  Complainant was employed by Hiles as a shepherd about 15 miles from Kooringa.  He had gone to the head station to enquire about a dog and Hiles had knocked him down and kicked him severely.

Defendant said complainant had abused the defendant’s partner and then when told to return to his sheep, he had rushed at the defendant with an open knife, which the defendant had taken from him and thrown away.

John Chewings corroborated Hiles story and produced the knife.

William Stoneham was shearing sheep at the defendant’s woolshed when he heard the disturbance.  He saw the complainant rush at the defendant with the knife and saw Hiles take the knife and strike Barrett.

His Worship dismissed the complaint and ordered costs to be divided.
