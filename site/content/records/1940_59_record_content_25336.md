Mr Harry Mann brought a snake into the Commercial Hotel on Friday and let it wander around the bar.  Patrons sidestepped while he teased it till it bit him.  He took little immediate notice, but later collapsed at the Burra Market and was taken to the Burra Hospital.  Mr Wakeman of Koonoona later arrived with the same snake in his pocket at the Burra Hotel where he too played with it.  Just as he was about to leave the bar he collapsed and needed medical treatment.  Mr Fred Leonard of the Burra Hotel then killed the snake, but knew that the four foot grey reptile had no fangs and no poison.  Mr Mann is in hospital, but is not being treated for snake bite and Mr Wakemanâ€™s fainting fit was a result of war service.
