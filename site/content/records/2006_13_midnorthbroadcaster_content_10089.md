Merrie Elliott of Booborowie writes concerning the closing of emergency services at Burra Hospital.

Despite Country Health SAâ€™s assurance that nothing has changed, it is clear that the absence of an on site doctor is a definite change.  Apart from the needs of local residents there are at least four other major concerns:

Thousands of tourists travel through the town and district.  Does this make a litigation case possible if emergency services are not available?

Burra has the only hospital on the Barrier Highway between Riverton and Peterborough.  It is a stretch notorious for the number of accidents it hosts.

The Burra Hospital is vital to the residents of the vast sparsely settled pastoral area to the east.

Increasing wind farm and mining activity in the district is exposing more people to potentially hazardous situations in the work place.

Country Health SA Hospital Inc released last week a draft copy of its 10 year Local Health Service Plan for the Lower North.  Respondents to surveys clearly said they did not want to lose facilities they had and that an emergency service was identified by 65% or respondents as a basic and minimum service required locally.  A delegation of concerned citizens met with the CEO of Goyder Council on Tuesday and it is hoped some answers and an understanding of the issues involved will follow.
