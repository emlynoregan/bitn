The Parsons’ Exhibition – Critique by Glenys Christopher

The panorama of the Burra Hills commissioned by the Council to celebrate Burra’s J150 is in the unique style of Allyson Parsons and is a beautiful acquisition by and for the people of the district.

‘Detail of grasses, shrubs, rocks and building materials, the foreground in shadow and the distant hills lit by a soft and glowing light make this work a superb celebration of the artist’s love of this country and of Burra’s 150 years.  Realism, detail and subtle colour are obvious attributes of Allyson’s work, but her portrayal of light makes her paintings breathtaking.’

Marie’s drawings are exquisite.  Sunlight reflects off enamel jugs and teapots, dazzles on the skins of pomegranate and lights background hills.  The whole exhibition is a credit to these two artists and the venue is superb.
