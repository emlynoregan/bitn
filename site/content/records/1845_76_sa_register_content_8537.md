Kooringa Bible Christian Chapel held its third anniversary meeting on 15 August.  Three impressive sermons by Rev. W. Fursman were preached on the previous Sabbath.  The public tea on Monday 15 August was held in the chapel, after which Mr Burgess took the chair for the meeting.  Total receipts amounted to Â£27-3-5.  This is sufficient to liquidate remaining liabilities, so that the chapel and mission house are now free from debt.
