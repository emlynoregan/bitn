The National Service Officer Mr Clarke recently visited the Town Council accompanied by the President of the Fathers’ Association Mr G.H. Dollman.  Mr Clarke said there were ten districts similar to his in SA.  Records of each demobilised person were kept.  The Department gave other advice and incorporated a Legal Aid Bureau.  Unfortunately at present there was more unemployment in Burra amongst returned servicemen than in any other town in his area – the total was between 15 and 20 men.  Men desirous of obtaining a farm could get easy terms through the State Bank.  Men discharged for more than 12 months could obtain assistance to purchase tools of trade.  His department had hundreds of jobs available.  The position of Burra seems to have arisen because many wives came to Burra during the war and now when the men returned they found it hard to get work in Burra and hard to get a home in the city.  The Mayor said they might get the Ballast Quarry and cracking plant into operation.  It might also be a good idea to get some industry started.  Government assistance might be obtainable for some capital works projects such as the Cemetery Road.
