Burra Town Council

The Hon. John Lewis declined a conference re Paxton Square.  Council could take it or leave it.  He had no desire to inflict a liability on the Council.

Advice has been received that the telephone service would be continuous from 7 a.m. Monday to 11 p.m. Saturday.  There would be a 15 minute service beginning at 9 a.m., 1 p.m., 6 p.m., and 11 p.m. on Sundays.

Cr Killicoat apologised for his absence and says he has been told the Hindmarsh Fire Brigade might soon have a reel for sale.

So far Â£60-19-0 of the special flood grant has been spent.  No news yet of any subsequent grant.

A series of jobs were approved on roads and footpaths.

The Chief Secretary will be asked that Burra be brought under the Place of Entertainments Act.

Council resolved it could not accept Paxton Square on the terms last set out.

An enlarged photo of the 1914 Council has been hung in the chamber.

Cr McWaters moved that a copy of the splendid enlarged photo of the procession on Belgian Flag Day by Mr Page be purchased and framed.  Carried.
