Retrial of Lt Morant, Handcock and Witton

The retrial went very well with television and radio present.  Special thanks go to Mike Day, Steve Woolley, Don Griffen and Kevin Nitschke for fielding all the media calls and to Gerry Baulderstone for sound and recording.  Plans are in hand to produce a video.  Morant this time was found not guilty.
