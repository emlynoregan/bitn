Burra Town Council, 18 January

A Request for a special main roads grant has been refused.

Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. seek the transfer of the creek lease, as they have bought Bagot, Shakes & Lewis Ltd.  This was granted.

The Local Government Dept. is forwarding a photo of HMAS Australia framed with wood from the ship.  A similar item is going to each Corporation in Australia.

J.J. Park has been appointed ranger.

Some places have been trading on Sunday.

Diprose Creek pound has been gazetted with Mr Ford as pound keeper.

Amounts available for expenditure on roads (apart from main roads):

North Ward	£256

East Ward	£418

West Ward	£358

Steps are to be taken to enforce silencers on motorbikes that were disturbingly loud; especially on the Adelaide Road and past the hospital.
