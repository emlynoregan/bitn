Obituary& Inquest. W.C. Beasely died at the Bon Accord Hotel 20 June. Inquest by J.D. Cave JP. William A. Stewart: - Deceased came to the hotel on 17 June. He went to Hallett by train on 18 June and returned the same day by the 5 p.m. train. On 19 June he complained of ague which he had had for some time and he thought an attack was imminent, but it was not serious. He was a bit down, but saw nothing to suggest he was about to destroy himself The following morning a servant heard some moaning and went up and found he had cut his throat and was dead. He left a suicide note which is printed, but offers no real explanation beyond: -`Life has no pleasure for me.'

[Died 20 June Aberdeen, residence Queensland aged 45.]
