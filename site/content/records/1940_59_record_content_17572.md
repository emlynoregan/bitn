Burra Bowling Club wound up the season on Saturday last.  A.B. Riggs as President presented the trophies:

Singles Handicap	M.S. Edwards

Pairs Handicap	J.T. Pascoe & A. Bruce

Championship	O. Finch

Consistency	A. Bruce

Mr & Mrs Maxted & family were given a farewell from Mt Bryan East on 29 April.  They have been residents for 16 years and have now moved to Mt Bryan.

Sid Johnson of Burra won a 10 round boxing match on points at the Grenfell St Stadium on Saturday night.

A.P. Rogers, grocer, will not be leaving Burra after all.  Some hitch in the sale of his business will result in his remaining here.

Mothersâ€™ Day was celebrated in Burra with special services at the Methodist Churches and the Salvation Army Hall.

Weather.  The opening of the season has been the best since 1933 with so far over 2 inches of rain this month.  Some falls have extended to the east with recent recordings of from 20-45 points since Friday morning.

Flt-Lieut. Robert Pratty made a forced landing at Mt Bryan on Friday.  He became the guest of honour at the dance that evening.
