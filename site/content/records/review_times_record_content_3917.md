Mr Fidock paid tribute to Eva and Ian Auhl and then acknowledged the contributions of the many people who had prepared the collection of material for use in the purpose-built room.  Chris McCabe presented a cheque for $500 to the Library Board from Mr & Mrs Auhl.

Also present was the immediate past Principal of Burra Community School, Mr R. Henderson.  He presented two suitably inscribed photographs to go on the wall of the room; one of Ian Auhl and the other of Colin Fidock.  School Council member Helen Stockman announced that word had come from the Education Department that the position of an education officer for Burra would be funded from 1988.  Guests then inspected the collection, displays in the library and enjoyed afternoon tea.  Colin Fidock cut a cake celebrating the ninth birthday of the Community Library.
