There were some 500 spectators and eight teams in the dragon boat event, which was won by the Boarding House students.  The morning parade of entries included some very large stilted puppets from WomAdelaide’s the ‘Ringless Circus’.  Flour bombs from the bridge played a part in the outcome of races.  The Nourse bath-boat, complete with shower, was high in the style stakes, but with the heavier Nourse-Brak combination in the bath promptly sank upon their boarding.  The last regatta was held in 1988.  The idea began in 1985 when Jimmy James, in attempting to cross the flooded creek at the Bon Accord Hotel, lost his car to the floodwaters.  Peter Reilly bravely mounted a rescue mission – some say against immense odds – and pulled off a famous rescue.  This encouraged locals to immortalise his actions in the annals of local history, leading to the Burra Yacht Club and the boat races.  [3 photos.]
