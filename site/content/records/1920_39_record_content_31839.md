Burra Town Council, 16 September

The civic reception for the Governor will take place at the show at c. 11.30 outside the luncheon pavilion.  School children will be asked to assemble at that time and the Board of the Burra Hospital.

The Aviation Dept. advises that the Government has no intention at present of establishing an air route that would include Burra.

The Burra Institute Committee advises that it intends publishing Looking Back by Frank Treloar – as published recently in the Record.   It will cost 1/-.  Any profits will go to the Benevolent Society.

Council will donate £5 towards the cost.
