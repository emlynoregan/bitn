Soldiers’ Aid Society, 12th AGM at Redruth Memorial Hall 7 July

Heavy rain kept a number away.  During the year 10 meetings were held with an average attendance of about 12.  The strawberry fete raised £51 for the Royal Institution for the Blind.  The total raised to date for them is thus £689-18-8.  £13 was sent to the Red Cross for Christmas cheer for soldiers in hospital.  Miss Bubb, President, Secretary & Treasurer, read her report and hoped someone would take over the position of Secretary & Treasurer.  Miss Bubb announced a collection in aid of the Angorichina TB Soldiers Car and £5-5-0 was raised.  Elected: President, Miss Bubb; Vice-Presidents, Mesdames M.A. Radford, F.M. Pearce Sen. & T. Turner; Secretary, Mrs Guy Tiddy * Treasurer, Mrs M.A. Radford.
