Ulooloo Goldfields.  The mining area has been extended, but with no finds of any importance lately.  The Government party is a farce with all the men concentrated on a section about 50 yards square near ‘Pinch Gut’.  The Advertiser correspondent says c. 100 men are on the field and nuggets of from 5 dwt to 2 oz are daily coming to hand.  Gold is fetching £3-10-0 per oz.  This is a low price as banks won’t buy it and jewellers are giving only a low price.
