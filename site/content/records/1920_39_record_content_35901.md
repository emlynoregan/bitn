Since the Council meeting we understand Mr Bednall has varied his position and now believes Cr Woollacott can stand for Mayor without resigning as Councillor.

[It is a little odd that this became an issue in 1930 given that parallel situations had arisen before with Councillors standing for Mayor in the middle of their term as Councillor.

Edward Lipsett (end of 1877), E.C. Lockyer (end of 1881), P.L. Killicoat (end of 1887), E.W. Crewes (end of 1909 and M. Collins (end of 1922).  Edward Lipsettâ€™s action occasioned a special election, but the others produced elections held concurrently with the other Council Elections for the year.]
