Mt Bryan School.  Some of the pupils have been found to have significant levels of arsenic in recent tests.  Household water tanks are suspected to be the source and the arsenic is believed to have come from dust raised in grading and removing ballast stone from the abandoned railway.  This has been removed and crushed at Mt Bryan since early 1994.  First grade stone is stockpiled and used on existing lines.  The second grade is finer and the third is quite powdery.  For years the weeds along the line were controlled by arsenic sprays.
