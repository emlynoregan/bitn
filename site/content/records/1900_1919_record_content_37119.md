Obituary.  Mr George Sara died 24 January 1914.  He was born in 1813 at Strongate, Parish of Mylor, Cornwall.  When he was 9 his parents moved to Perranwell and he was sent to mining work.  Later he was taught to be a mason.  He married in 1836 and came to SA 12 years later with 4 sons on the Westminster, arriving 9 July 1848.  Not getting work in Adelaide he went to Willunga.  Soon after he tried the Victorian gold fields, but with little success, though together with two sons he managed to get £600 worth of gold in six months.  He returned to Willunga and took up contract work.  He built many early structures there including the tower of the Roman Catholic Church, the old Anglican Church and the parsonage on Aldinga Rd and two Wesleyan Churches.  He owned the Bangor Slate Quarries at Willunga, but abandoned them as unprofitable with a loss of £6,000.  In business with his two sons they built all the railway stations from Riverton to Burra, the Burra School, the Gladstone Gaol, a hotel at Orroroo, the Aldinga Mill, the gorge Bridge at Yankalilla and the viaduct at Currency Creek.  He was the grandfather of J.G. Sara of Aberdeen and leaves two sons, 24 grandchildren, 34 great-grandchildren and 2 great-great-grandchildren.
