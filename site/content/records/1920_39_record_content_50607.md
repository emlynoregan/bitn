Burra Town Council, 16 April

The RSL sought and gained permission for a procession and service on 28th April.

T. Harrop was granted permission to conduct a pie stand in Market Square and then following discussion the Council decided to impose a fee of 5/-. 

Burra Electric Supply Co. is to be asked to install a light in the rotunda.

The Sunday tennis discussion then broke out again.  Argument ensued over the use of dates or names of days and the differences, if any, between them.  Cr Bevan couldn’t see why there was all the fuss this year when the agreement had been broken without it for the past eight years.  Eventually the matter was dropped without any action.

The usual business was then delayed by a visit from the Deputy Postmaster General Mr E.P. Ramsay with Messrs White and Farrell of the Postal Department in Adelaide and Messrs R.R. Bunney Kooringa Postmaster and W. Anderson of the Telephone Dept. with Messrs J.G. & F.T. Sara & E.J. Harris.  Council had no complaints to raise about the operations of the Department in Burra.

The Government will be asked for a special grant to do up the road from Mr Bednall’s (corner of Smelts Rd & Ludgvan St) to Abberton Park.

Mt Bryan East Methodist Sunday School held its anniversary services on 15 April when Rev. Weeding officiated.
