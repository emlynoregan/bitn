Political Meeting at Greenock Creek

[Though not a Burra meeting, this is significant in mentioning a number of the changes that were brought about by the new Constitution for SA in 1856.  This introduced a bicameral system of Parliament, with universal male suffrage in the lower house and a property qualification in the Legislative Council.  It marked the end of nominated members and stipulated that all money bills had to originate in the lower house.  The Governor would no longer be able to authorise expenditure of money or make appointments or dismissals unless they were countersigned by the Chief Secretary.]

The meeting last Saturday was chaired by Mr Nock and with many of the 60-70 present being Germans, Mr Kruger acted as interpreter.  Mr Bagot addressed the meeting as a candidate for Parliament.

He pointed to some of the constitutional changes and their possible results in terms of policy:

Adult male suffrage with a six months residency requirement had given the vote to the German residents for the first time.

Parliament had gained control of the Land Fund. [That is money raised from the sale of Crown Land.]

This change should result a fairer distribution of expenditure on roads; the northern roads had been shamefully neglected in the past.

The Governor would no longer be able to spend huge sums on his own pet projects; as in the case of the Port Elliot breakwater, for example.

Men born in a foreign country were no longer excluded from election to Parliament.

Roads and railways north of Adelaide would receive more attention.

More would be done for general education.
