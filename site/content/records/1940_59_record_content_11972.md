A Presentation to Soldiers was made at the Rotunda in Market Square on Sunday after the church services.  Soldiers home on leave were: Sgt Linden Riggs, Ptes F.P. Tamblyn & Roy Walker.  Pte Eddie Nankivell was unavoidably absent.  Speakers were the Mayor, Rev. M.P. Cowle, Rev. H.K. Bartlett and Mr S.C. Genders for the RSL.

The Mayor paid tribute to three Burra lads who had recently made the supreme sacrifice: Ptes David Wooton, Sydney Borowski and Angus Halliday.

Eddie Nankivell had joined the AIF two years ago, but due to an accident had not been able to leave for service abroad before now.  Presentations were made.
