Burra Primary School Committee held its Annual Meeting.  Elected: Chairman, M.G .Stockman and Secretary-Treasurer, D. Bannister.

Staff changes since Christmas:

Mrs Sladden, Miss Coventry and Mrs Sullivan have left, and Miss Reed, Miss Longford and Mr King have come.

There are seven teachers for seven classes.

Report for the past year:

Education Week passed off very well.  A sports day on the oval again replaced the annual picnic.  Visiting Day was held in conjunction with the High School and Arbor Day was held in winter.  The land between the Drill Hall and the School has at last been transferred to the Education Department and can now be developed as a playing area.  A sick bay has been built in the central part of the school and furnished by the Welfare Club.  All rooms now have efficient lighting for dull days.  Nothing has yet eventuated from a deputation and discussions regarding a crossing near the Town Hall.  At present two white lines make a crossing.  The school’s new roof was a godsend during this summer’s storms.  We are pushing for a Primary School toilet block on the east side of the school.  In the year sporting equipment has been purchased and a Christmas party was held in each class.  A school uniform has been selected with colours of grey and blue.
