Football.  Burra travelled to Terowie on Wednesday, but as some members had to be back the same day it was quite a rushed trip.  They took the midday train north and the 3.30 p.m. luggage train south from Terowie which left little enough time for the match which started at 1.30 p.m.

Terowie		3.4	3.4	5.7	5.7	(37)

Burra		0.0	3.3	3.4	3.4	(22)
