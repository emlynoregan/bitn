`... we hope that democracy will never have unlimited rule for we are satisfied that the best possible form of Government is a despotic one, always provided that the despot is imbued with uprightness and justice. Self-government is no government and the only reason for allowing the people to assist in the work of government is that a community for very selfishness and self-seeking is less likely to perpetuate (and too fickle to constantly maintain) a system of misrule, than an evil disposed despot.'
