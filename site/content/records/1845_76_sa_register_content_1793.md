A Ruminating Biped writes:

‘Many a  poor man like myself will be obliged if you will give him a hint how he may make sure of deriving some benefit from imparting to others the discovery of a valuable lode of copper or other minerals…But what advantage is there for any person to impart a valuable discovery?  If a shepherd who has made such a discovery is urged to reveal it the answer is, “Remember Picket.”  If the shepherd’s master makes the discovery he is apt to hold his tongue because he does not want to lose his sheep run.’
