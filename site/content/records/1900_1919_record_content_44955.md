New Education Act.  The key provisions of the Act are printed.  Attendance now became compulsory from 6 to 14 (previously 7 to 13) and attendance was required on every school day, but a child who gains a Qualifying Certificate may leave any time after turning 13.  The Qualifying Certificate will allow the child to attend a technical or high school.  Children within compulsory ages must not be employed in school hours or outside them if it handicaps them in doing their schoolwork.  Persistent truants may be committed to an institution.

[Significantly, given the war, was the provision that the education given each day had to be through the medium of English for at least four hours.  This was aimed at the system of German language schools in the state.]
