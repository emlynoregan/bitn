Gawler Town.  No place in the province has benefited more than Gawler Town from the opening of extraordinary copper mines to the north.  It is now universally believed that it must become the second town in the province.  It is not at present a large place, containing only twenty houses, but it shows vigorous growth as many of these houses have been recently built.  A steam flour mill has recently been built and is soon to open.  There is a butcher, tin plate workers, blacksmiths, carpenters and shoemakers. There is an inn and two retail shops are to be immediately erected.  We believe Â£150 was recently paid for a one-acre block in Murray Street.  We know of no place where investment in land, housing or almost any business is surer to yield a handsome return.  Barossa farmers are now making a detour of twelve miles to go via Gawler to avoid the execrable mountain road via Chain of Ponds.
