Editorial on the Defeat of the Holder Ministry.

This is an entirely futile change with elections due in a few months.  The incoming [Sir John] Downer Government will achieve little in that time as it has not a working majority.  The criticism made of the [outgoing] Governmentâ€™s finances is hardly reasonable as no one could say what provision will have to be made for the ongoing Broken Hill strike.  Among the most obstructive MPs are Messrs Grainger, Rounsevell and Homburg: two of whom are rewarded with office.
