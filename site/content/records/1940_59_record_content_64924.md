Obituary.  Mr R. (Bob) Phillips died at Burra Hospital last Wednesday aged 71.  He had not been in good health for the last three years.  He was born at World’s End in 1883 and at an early age he and some of his brothers pioneered some of the country north of Morgan.  In 1912 he married Miss Winter and they had four children: Joyce Sister Phillips of an Adelaide Hospital, Keith Phillips of Eudunda, Rita Mrs Johns of Adelaide and Lance Phillips who died in 1948.  Mr Phillips stayed in the Morgan area till 1919 when he acquired the property known as Gandy’s Range, now known as Oakview.  This is presently owned by his son, Keith.  In 1927 he and his family went to live in Morgan, where he took great interest in civic affairs.  He later acquired ‘Studholme’ where he lived from 1933 till his death.  There he ran a successful Merino Stud, getting many ribbons and trophies at shows throughout the district and along the River Murray.  [Robert Phillips born 29 July 1883 World’s End: died 25 August 1954 Burra, residence Baldina.]
