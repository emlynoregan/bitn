Community Health Needs Survey recently produced a good response rate of 43%.  The survey sought to identify knowledge of current health services, use of health services and future health needs.

Most respondents were satisfied with the services received.  There was some dissatisfaction concerning shortage of services by GP, dieticians, for mental health and in home care services.  The major needs were identified as:

A female GP

A Women’s Health Clinic

An additional male GP

An upgraded accident and emergency department.

The possibility of a visiting female GP is being discussed.

An upgrade of the Casualty, X-Ray and Treatment-Recovery section of the hospital is due to begin in mid-1994.  A range of other services were seen as ‘desirable’.  [Listed.]
