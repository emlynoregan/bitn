After long and difficult negotiations an agreement has been signed between the Burra Electric Supply Co. and ETSA.

Negotiations started on 22 August 1950, when the Council asked Mr Hawker MP to take up the matter of ETSA power supply for Burra.

In May 1952 Mr Lea, then manager of ETSA, wrote to Mr Hawker pointing out the difficulties of supplying Burra and saying it would have to wait the connection of Port Augusta Power station and the construction of mains through Waterloo.  The lines at other places that terminated at Farrell Flat and Booborowie were inadequate to supply as large a town as Burra.

In February 1952 the General Manager of ETSA said the Trust would not be able to supply Burra for five years and had been advised that the local company could meet expected requirements for several years.  As this was not the view of the Town Council, information was needed that required the co-operation of the Council and the local Company.

This further investigation followed a discussion between Mr Drew, Chairman of the Trust, the Premier and Mr Hawke on 23 June 1954.

On 10 December 1954 Mr Lea informed Mr Hawker that he was recommending to the Trust they supply and reticulate electricity for Burra and work would begin as soon as money was made available, depending on satisfactory arrangements with the local Company to take over their system.  Unfortunately Mr Lea died two days later.

Early in 1955 valuations were made by the Trust and the Company, but when submitted in July they were far apart.  Mr Hawker then took up negotiations again and subsequently the Company decided to continue negotiations, but on 29 September the Premier informed Mr Hawkes the Trust had not heard from the Burra Company and, as another town was negotiating, Burra would lose its priority unless he knew immediately Burraâ€™s position.  Despite urgent discussions unfortunately it was not until the 11 October that Mr Bednall saw Mr Colyer, the Manager of ETSA.  Since then negotiations have continued and a recent letter of ETSDA to the Council announced that the negotiations had been completed.  The supply of ETSA power is still dependent upon establishment of the Port Augusta Power Station and sub-stations and negotiations with the local Company.
