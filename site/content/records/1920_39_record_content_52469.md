Burra Town Council, 20 April

Kooringa Football Club responded to the water bill recently sent to them.  The Secretary K. Kennedy said firstly the club had no money and secondly from tests made the water could not possibly have been used by the club.

The Water Supply Dept. replied on the same issue that the District Engineer reported two large sprinklers had been kept going to soften the ground and a reduction could not be recommended.

The Mayor said the Inspector had drawn his attention to the water use and the meter was new.  The club paid them only 36/- a year.

Cr Kellaway said the annual charge to the club of £2-2-0 had been reduced to 35/- and in any case the account should have been sent to the Football Association, which handled the funds.

The mayor said that on occasion the club had let the water run all night.

Resolved that the bill be sent to the Football Association.

The Employment Relief Council wrote asking if there was a site suitable for landing an aircraft within the town and if so a grant might be made to put it in order.

The Mayor thought there were certain blocks in Aberdeen that could be bought.

Cr Dow said the racecourse was too small.

The Mayor thought there was room between the Drill Hall and the Creek.  [Which seems an extraordinary suggestion given the position of the school.]

It was resolved to seek clarification on the area needed and for the Chairman of Public Works to make an inspection.

Council resolved to donate £2-2-0 to the Pt Pirie Appeal.

R.C. Lott was granted permission to build.

The steps in front of the Record office are to be removed.  They had always been dangerous and the set in front of Mr Pascoe’s was sufficient.
