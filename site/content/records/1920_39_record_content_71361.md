Weather.  A severe frost on Thursday froze pipes and water and milk in jugs etc.  Water in tanks froze over.  The Market Square trough was still a sheet of ice at 1.30 p.m.

Feed was severely damaged and trees and hedges were cut back by it.

Rain fell to the east last Tuesday with registrations between 26 & 60 points, but not enough to provide run-off.
