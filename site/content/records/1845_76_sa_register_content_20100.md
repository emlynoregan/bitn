Buildings During 1866

[A long list encompasses building in the colony for the previous year.  Burra’s part has been extracted.]

A church has been erected at Kooringa for the Catholics in the Norman style, oblong in form and capable of affording accommodation to a large number of persons.

[This is interesting because there seems to be no other reference to this building.  A summary of the Catholic presence in the town made in 1905 gives the following outline:
