‘Fairplay’ points out that the unfairness mentioned in the previous editorial about one part of the town closing hotels on Sunday and others being open already applies as North Ward hotels are closed and the only way to equalise matters is to close hotels in East and West Wards as well.

Cricket remains a non-event.

Sculling remains a great interest and a match for the championship of the world is being planned between McLean and Kemp at Parramatta on 12 December for £300 or £700.

Burra Mine continues to be worked by tributers on a small scale and they are said to be making fair wages.

The Fire Clay deposits at Chalk cliffs remain undeveloped.
