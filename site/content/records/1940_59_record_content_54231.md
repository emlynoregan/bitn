Fire.  At about 3.30 p.m. 27 March fire broke out near the Old Koomooloo Homestead.  Apparently employees were burning stubble when 100 yards from the northeast corner of the paddock a whirlwind scattered the fire.  Despite prompt action it spread and burnt towards the Adelaide Road.  The fire was extinguished by 6.30 p.m., but about 1 p.m. on Friday a gusty northeaster saw it break out on the south side of the burnt area and quickly spread towards Koonoona Homestead.  The hilly access was difficult and it burnt until c. 4.30 p.m.  Stock losses were very low and about 5 square miles of grass was lost.
