Stuart Plaque Unveiled

A plaque was unveiled in front of the Burra Art Gallery on Saturday morning to commemorate the return of the successful John McDouall Stuart expedition in 1861.  Local resident of 36 years, Beth Field and her sister Pat Farquhar with husband Norman (who came from Victoria) were present.  [Photo.]

The sisters were born in Gawler, not far from the house at Kingsford where the explorer Stephen King lived.  He was their grandmother’s brother and had taken part in the 1861 Stuart expedition, crossing the continent from south to north and back.  As a result of his involvement he also became involved in a survey for the erection of the overland telegraph from Adelaide to Darwin.

Judge Wilson, Chairman of the Gallery’s Board, is also related to Stephen King.  He referred to the connection in his speech.  The Mortlock Library had agreed to the display of four original sketches by Stephen King as part of a small exhibition of pictures and memorabilia associated with the expedition.  About 50 members of the John McDouall Stuart Society attended the event.  Their President, Tony Auld expressed their gratitude for the hospitality shown them.
