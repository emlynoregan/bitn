Editorial on The Burra Mine.

When the old mine stopped the tower engine and crushing plant with jigs was working well.  With but little outlay these could be put in working order and while modern machinery might be an improvement the old would suffice to get things started.  The directors have been reluctant to invest in machinery until ore was found.  Now it has been, so there is a grand opportunity to get moving.  The other alternative is a reconstruction or reflotation of the company.
