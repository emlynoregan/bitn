Of nine inter-club matches six had been won: two against Hamley Bridge and those against Kapunda, Riverton, Berri & Renmark, while Eudunda, Wasleys and Gawler had beaten Burra.

The Mokota Trophy went to beginner W.G. Woodman.

‘Our other popular shot, T. Rosewall, who had 28 points got into the hands of the police, so could not fire the last match.’  [He joined the police force.]

The Championship match was won by H.L. Riggs and the Handicap Champion was A.P. Harris.

The club is indebted to Mr I.J. Warnes for use of the property.  Unfortunately the club could not raise a team for the Country Championship this year because it was too close to harvest.

The Mayor presented the trophies.  He then offered the Abberton Park Trophy for the next year’s highest points gained.

Other prizes were:

Highest aggregate at 200, 500 & 600 yards:	T. Rosewall

Highest aggregate at 300, 500 & 600 yards:	J. Pederson

Highest aggregate at 300, 500 & 700 yards:	W. Woodman

Elected were Captain, A.L. Kellock; Vice-Captain, C.W. Pearce; Treasurer, J.E. Pearce & Secretary, A.P. Harris.
