Obituary.  Richard Simpson aged 73 died at Belalie North on 1 January.  He appears to have become dizzy and fallen into the well where he drowned.  He was the eldest son of the late Mr & Mrs Richard Simpson of Booborowie where he was born in 1857 when his father was shepherding there.  The family lived in Kooringa for many years and the deceased, who was unmarried, lived with his mother in George St till she died aged 96.  Not being in good health he soon after went to live with his only brother at Belalie.  J.R. Simpson of Mt Bryan is a nephew.  [Born 18 June 1856 at Canowie, so 75.]
