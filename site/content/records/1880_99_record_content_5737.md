Pearse v. Burra Corporation.  The verdict has been for the corporation.  Pearse had claimed £70 for extra work as he claimed that changes were made during the work which reduced the amount of soil from the excavation and forced him to cart in 1,200 yds3 from elsewhere.  The council in defence showed that the excavation would have cost more than carting in the extra filling.
