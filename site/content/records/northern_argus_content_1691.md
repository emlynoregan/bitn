Burra Heritage Town J150 Project which received a grant of $270,000 opens on Sunday 5 October at the Burra Mine site.  The Director General of the Department of Mines & Energy, Mr Keith Jones, will open the three project sites: Morphett’s Enginehouse, Bon Accord Mine Museum and the Kingston Street row of the Paxton Square cottages.  Speakers will include Kym Bonython, Chairman of the J150 Board.  The three foot thick walls of Morphett’s Enginehouse now stand as strong as they did last century.  A pumping accident nearly tore the place apart in the 1870s and a fire that gutted the Enginehouse and the shaft in the 1920s left it a ruin.  A J150 allocation of $90,000 and the Department of Mines & Energy grant of $35,000, plus contributions from the Burra Burra DC and the Department of Tourism have seen the building restored.  It is now the world’s only restored Cornish Enginehouse.  Burra Apex has been working to restore the adit tunnel to the shaft and they hope to have it ready for Sunday’s opening.
