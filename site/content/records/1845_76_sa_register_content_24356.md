John Baker the bushranger.  Constable Murphy has returned to Wilcannia from Bourke, where he delivered John Baker to the prison authorities.  He reports that when he arrived at Dashan’s & Mungovern’s Tankarooka Station 75 miles up the river, at midnight, the prisoner was placed in a room, leg-ironed and chained with a dog-chain to a sofa.  About 3 a.m. he asked to go to the back of the house.  Afterwards he was again chained to a bench outside.  Suddenly he made a desperate effort and broke the handcuffs.  He struck the trooper twice on the temple.  Murphy got hold of him by the throat and Baker kicked him in the stomach and made every effort to get hold of the constable’s revolver.  Murphy was aided by Captain Parker of the Kennedy, who happened to be there.  He strapped the prisoner’s hands behind his back.  Baker still persisted and head butted the policeman in the stomach.  The prisoner was then placed in the mail van and part way to Bourke his hands were released after his entreaties.  They reached Bourke between 3 and 4 p.m. on Sunday.  Constable Murphy is to be praised for his pluck, skill and endurance in overcoming the obstacles and hardships of such a mission.
