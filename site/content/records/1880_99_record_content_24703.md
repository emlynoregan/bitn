Editorial deploring the maldistribution of wealth and especially the concentration of disproportionate amounts in the hands of those ‘who toil not, neither do they spin, and yet the other classes pay taxes for the maintenance of their Government and for the improvement of their property.’

There are some good signs of change; one is the gradual emergence of a change from wheat only to the use of summer fodder crops, ensilage, and some diversity of farming activity - a testimony to the work of Professor Custance.
