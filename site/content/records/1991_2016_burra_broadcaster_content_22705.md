Notice.  A public meeting at Mt Bryan Soldiers Memorial Hall on 3 July is called to help plan the future of a new grasslands conservation park which the Government of SA has purchased as a 455 ha property approximately 5 km east of Mt Bryan to protect a remnant iron grass (Lomandra multiflora ssp. Dura) tussock grassland.  It is expected the park will soon be proclaimed as Mokota Conservation Park.
