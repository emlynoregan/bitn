Civil Defence.  The Institute was packed on Wednesday night for a meeting called by Burra Corporation Civil Defence Committee.

The meeting advocated:

National Conscription of manpower and wealth as in Britain.

The formation of a Home Defence Column, using the services of the RSL.

Drastic steps to curd Fifth Column activities.

Mr M.W. Bednall, as Chairman of the Committee opened the meeting and called on the Mayor to preside.

The Mayor gave a patriotic address stressing the critical natures of the struggle.  Belgium had surrendered the night before and France was in the balance.  He was heart-broken at how few people had turned up to farewell departing soldiers and felt the apathy of Australians was reflected in their Government.  He urged involvement of all in the war effort to the last man and the last shilling and urged support for War Savings Certificates.

Mr M.W. Bednall explained the Civil Defence Scheme.  The government had asked the committee to prepare a plan to house 2,100 people from the city in the event of evacuation being needed.  Evacuees were expected to be expectant mothers, the blind, the infirm, mothers with children under five, and school children.  Air Raid Precautions had to be taken with shelters, warnings, lighting restrictions etc.

There needed to be anti-gas officers, people to look to repairs and to quench fires, to attend to casualties and to maintain communications.  All between 16 & 60 could be useful.  The committee did not think these things were going to be necessary, but they had to be prepared.

Dr Steele outlined what would be done for the injured in the event of an air raid.  First-aid posts would be established at Copperhouse, the Railway Station, The Oddfellows Hall and the Methodist Memorial Hall in Redruth for Burra North.  In Burra they would be at the CWA Rooms, the Salvation Army Hall, and The Methodist Sunday School Hall.  He called for National Conscription for the total war effort.

S. Hawker, President of the RSL called for universal training for war and much more, in a ½ column speech.  H.J.B. Jennison moved the motions and called for a more enthusiastic support for the war effort.  G.H. Dow seconded and supported the motions.

There was then a musical program, which included the singing of:

Land of Hope and Glory	The Audience
