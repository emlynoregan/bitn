At the Burra Institute last Thursday evening there was a small attendance to hear the speakers explain the object of the National Party.  [Actually it was the Nationalist Party.]  This was the union of the Liberal and Labour Party on the one platform.  The Premier, the Hon. Crawford Vaughan, spoke.  The election had been brought about by the actions of certain senators.  He made scarcely veiled suggestions impugning the loyalty of his opposition.
