The Anzac Sports Carnival was held last Saturday under the auspices of the RSL.  The weather was excellent and the whole event was extremely successful.  This second annual carnival eclipsed that held in 1933 and the organisation was very good.  The cycling and athletic tracks had been very well prepared.  It is estimated that about 2,000 people attended with some 400 cars.  The horse events were excellent.  The main interest focussed on the draught horse race.  There were 13 starters and the favourite Ralph Hill’s Flying Vixen upset backers by tying with Con Lynch’s Gay Night for last place.  Len Gordon on T. Kallio’s Wilful Winnie came first, just ahead of G. Dow on the same owner’s Waltzing Billy.

There were some thrilling motor cycle events and the cycling events were keenly contested.

The military events were in charge of Sgt Major R.J. Bernhardt.

[Personal interest: Ted Fuss won the cycle event for boys under 16.]

The Burra & Waikerie Bands played throughout the day.

The day began with a procession from the Burra hospital in charge of C. Sylvester Preiss.  This set off at 12.30 p.m., led by the combined Burra & Waikerie Bands.  Then came a detachment of the 18/23 Light Horse under Sgt. Major R.J. Bernhardt.

The program at the racecourse began on arrival and 40 events were all run off by 5.15 p.m.

The results are printed.
