Burra Rifle Club fired the 22nd stage of the E.C. Collins Trophy on Saturday over double 300 yards in high wind and occasional misty rain.  Nobody reached the limit of 80 points, the first time this has occurred for a long period. R.G. Bernhardt led the handicap section.  Both F.T. Marston and J.H. Schwier scored 69 off the rifle.
