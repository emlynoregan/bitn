A.L. Bence writes takes issue with being categorised by Mr Stanley Woollacott as ‘Hoodlums’.   He outlines the meeting of the Tennis club that led them to write to the Council seeking clarification on the matter of sport on Sunday.  He points out that the meeting was chaired by their Patron, Mr Frank Reed, a gentleman, well known in the town and who has himself and his family before him done a lot of good for Burra.

Those attending the meeting included a number of ladies who were the ones during the war were in the forefront, when it came to working for our lads overseas and the majority of the men were returned boys, sons of well-known townspeople.  He says everyone is entitled to their opinion as far as Sunday sport is concerned.  He refers to Rev. Donald Redding, one of the town’s most popular Rectors, who made a special early time to attend Holy Communion on Sunday mornings so we could go to golf afterwards, his contention was that healthy sport harms nobody.  The letter, he affirms, expresses not just the opinion of himself and his family, but those of a number of the ‘Hoodlums’ referred to and he thinks the only decent thing would be for Mr Stanley Woollacott to apologise to the ladies and gentlemen for his thoughtless remarks.
