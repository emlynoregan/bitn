Burra Town Council, 25 September.

The more detailed report of the meeting confirms the account of it in the editorial and shows Cr Harris twisting and turning to try to find another way of attacking the engineer – an effort in which he seems to find an ally in Cr Sampson.

1 October.

Cr Sampson took exception to the minutes of the last ordinary meeting, but after a long and acrimonious discussion they were confirmed as were those of the special meeting.

The Town Clerk was appointed to rewrite the assessment for 1894-95 for the sum of £5.

Crs Harris, Sampson and Parks voted not to accept the engineer’s report leading to another heated discussion on the engineer and his work.  Other more routine business was then transacted before adjourning.
