The Thrift Campaign, which was started as a wartime effort, has collected much material needed for the war and has raised £65,000 to date.  There will be some thousands more before the close.  The Burra Guide Group thanks all who helped and will close from 6 October.  Special thanks to Mr Phelan for the use of his room as a depot and to Mr Dick Harris and Mr Bill Woodman, who have spent most Saturday afternoons packing and labelling goods and to the Town Council for taking them to the railway station free of charge.
