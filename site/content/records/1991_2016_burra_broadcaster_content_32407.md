Burra Ward Project Funds were allocated at Council’s October meeting.  Four projects applied for funding:

The Burra Community Development Program $7,500 as matching funding for the refurbishment of the stage, auditorium and foyer flooring at the Town Hall.

Burra Senior Citizens for an automatic watering system for Burra Creek Gardens.  This was referred back for further costing and reconsideration by Burra Ward Councillors.

Burra Regional Art Gallery $5,000 for a part-time administrator/curator.  This was not supported as being outside the fund criteria.

Burra Community Sports Club $8,300 to $9,000 for a retaining wall.  This was not supported because Council had already made provision for this work in its annual budget.
