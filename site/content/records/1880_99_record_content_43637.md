Burra Town Council, 21 December.

The report in the paper is deficient, but what clearly happened was that Cr Hardy moved to rescind the motion that no permanent dayman be appointed and this was carried on the casting vote of the Mayor.  This is apparent because next Cr Parks proposed applications be called for dayman and overseer at 7/- per day and this was also carried on the Mayor’s casting vote.

Applications were then called for Engineer of the Waterworks.

The public Works Committee met except for Cr Rabbich who had previously retired and Cr Watt was elected chairman.

Mr Ridgway is to be asked to repair the fence around the parklands in Helen Terrace and if he refuses the Parklands Committee will attend to the same.  They will also attend to the fence in the Paradise Reserve.

Tenders are called for new gates to the cemetery extension similar to the existing ones.

Messrs Jenkin & Thomas were appointed special constables for New Year’s Eve.

Mr Geake appointed to attend the lamps for three months.

Mr Packard is not to be retained as Town Council solicitor for the coming year.

[At least this seems to have been the decision, though the paper report is a little confusing.]
