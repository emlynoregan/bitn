Redruth Court, Wednesday.

J. Lauritsen of Booborowie was charged with making unlawful threats to an elector, L.L. Larwood, schoolteacher of Booborowie to influence his vote in the Referendum of 28 October.  The accused and another threatened to dip him in a trough unless he voted NO.  Mr Bright got a dismissal for the defendant and Â£2-2-0 costs for want of proof that (a) Larwood was an elector and (b) a referendum was taken on 28 October.  [In both cases typical legalistic nonsense.]
