Obituary & Inquest.  August Bertram, on 1 August at the Burra Hospital, aged 75.  Leaving a wife [and descendents.]

The inquest showed that he was found at Newiky [sic] Creek, lying in the creek bed, by Alexander McPherson, labourer, of Caroona Station.  He was brought to hospital suffering from exposure, exhaustion and bronchitis.  The evidence does not clearly establish how he came to be there.  Evidence of his last days is given by: -

Charles Bertram - whose mother was August Bertram’s daughter.

William Herschausen [sic] - whose wife was August Bertram’s daughter

Eliza Williams -  a neighbour, who says: -

‘Mrs Bertram Sen. at Hampton is also her daughter’

[i.e. a daughter of the deceased’s wife and possibly therefore Charles Bertram’s mother]
