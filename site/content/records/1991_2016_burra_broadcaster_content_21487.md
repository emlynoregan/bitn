Archaeologist Peter Birt and students from Flinders University will conduct a dig here in early April.  Peter Harvey, a Research Fellow at the University of SA, a National Trust Member and the industry supervisor for the work, said he hoped the study would uncover many aspects of the multicultural community of early Burra where there were people from all parts of the UK, Germany, China, perhaps Chile and other places too.  Mr Birt will give a lecture in the Old Courthouse on 9 March.  The dig is sponsored by Flinders University, The Goyder Council, The Burra Burra National Trust and the Mid North Regional Development Board and is expected to extend for 2-3 years.
