Kooringa News, 30 July

Till within the last three days there has been much rain, placing the streets in a fearful state and almost impassable.

Accident.  Last week Mr W. Ross was travelling with about 8,000 sheep and camped the night near Sod Hut.  The night was wet and stormy.  A fire was lit by the cook under a hollow tree and the tent pitched nearby.  During the night the tree fell on the tent and a branch fell across the chest of Mr Ross and the back of another man, injuring him severely.  Dr Maurau treated both men, who were removed to the Sod Hut Inn where they are recovering, though still unable to continue their journey.

On Thursday 30 July a lecture was delivered by C.D. Cooper of Adelaide at the Burra Institute on the subject of Popular Poetry, both humorous and otherwise.  Mr MacDermott presided and the Burra Band enlivened proceedings.
