Len Simpson, well known Burra identity, went to Adelaide at the weekend to watch his grandson Adam Simpson play his 300th game for North Melbourne against the Adelaide Crows.  Len and his son Brian met with other family members and Adam at the Hilton Hotel before the match.  Len was an outstanding country footballer who captained Farrell Flat to victory in the 1945 premiership.  Brian was also a footballer and played many games in Burra before joining the National Bank in 1966.  He now lives in Victoria.
