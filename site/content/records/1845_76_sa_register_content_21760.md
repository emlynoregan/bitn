SA Mining Association

The Association’s AGM was held on 15 April.

Twelve to fourteen shareholders attended.

The 23rd Annual Report was taken as read.

During the past half year 1,746 tons of ore of an average 17% copper has been raised from new works near the surface.

The general operations of the Mine had included:

Pumping water from the workings.

Securing and renewing timber in various parts of the Mine.

Continuing to sink Graves’ Engine Shaft, which is now at 43½ fathoms.

Linking Graves’ Engine Shaft to Graham’s at the 30 fathom level.

Stoping ore from near the surface has yielded 80-90 tons of good ore per month.

Dressing halvins and extracting ore from waste.

We are satisfied the produce so obtained will more than meet costs.

The number employed at the Mine is 278.

Some principal shareholders in Europe have recommended engaging an engineer will acquainted with the latest methods of working and the economic preparation of ores.  They have such a person in mind and ask the Directors to engage him or such other competent person to determine the best system of working for the future.  The Directors sent the necessary authority to engage him and should receive by the next mail when he is to arrive in this country.

The Directors also said the completion of the Burra Railway would greatly facilitate the operations of the company.

At September 30 1867 the ore at grass was 858 tons and since then 1,746 tons has been raised for a total of 2,604 tons.

Of this 1,825 tons has been delivered to the Smelting Co. and 779 tons remains at the Mine.

The stock of copper on hand at 30 September 1867 was 412 tons and since then 169 tons has been received, making 581 tons.

200 tons of this was exported to England, 98 tons sold and 183 tons are on hand.

The progress in Graves’ Engine shaft was slow in very hard ground.  They hoped to be able to raise ore when it reached 60 or 70 fathoms.

The retiring Directors were re-elected.  Arthur Blyth and T.G. Waterhouse were leaving SA and were replaced with Messrs Henry Rymill and Neville Blyth.
