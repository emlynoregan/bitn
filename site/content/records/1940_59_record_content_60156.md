Valueless Cheques have been passed locally by a shearer who had been working on Woolgangi for one day.  Michael Peter Nolan, who originally said he was Patrick J. Kelly, then stopped at the Bon Accord and Burra Hotels for about nine days and passed four cheques to the value of £85.  As he was being escorted to Adelaide on Thursday by Sgt Barbary he jumped from the train’s toilet window near Dry Creek and was later recaptured at Owen.  He is wanted by Police in Victoria for similar offences, as well as in other parts of SA.
