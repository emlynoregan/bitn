Opening of the Burra Railway

Today the inhabitants of Burra are to hold a high festival in honour of the opening of the Northern Extension Railway.  This line to link the town with Adelaide has been under consideration for a quarter of a century, but its realisation seemed to keep on being remote.  The mines prospered and the surrounding towns grew to house thousands, but still no practical attempt was made to link them with the seaboard by the power of steam.  Even the provision of roads was of the scantiest description.  Hundreds of teamsters made the regular pilgrimage, but Macadam was never propitious to them.  Rough bush tracks gave them their general direction and they often had to navigate adjacent country in search of a better.  The demands of districts nearer Adelaide had always to be met first.  To this day the traveller to Burra by coach has the mournful experience of the fact that portions of the route have benefited little from any funds.  It was not until the decline of the Mines that Parliament turned its attention to the Burra railway.  Treasury was then in a thriving condition.   The determination to extend the railways came at a time when the public building policy, since much abused, was popular.  Many districts then spoke out for rail extensions.  The northern areas were agitated by public meetings.  Petitions from Kooringa and other intermediate localities recommended themselves to the Assembly.  The line would have to pass through large tracts with almost unlimited agricultural potential and its terminus would attract the traffic of hundreds of square miles of pastoral country and it would monopolise the immense trade of a mine that promised to regain much of its celebrity through systematic management.    The Bill was passed in 1867 and now the line is ready to be opened.  The great building proposals generally have resulted in a debt of £600,000, with its attendant interest charges.  The results have so far failed to deliver the great profits predicted.  Railways have been extended from 70 to 193 miles.  The line has been constructed at less than £5,000 per mile on average.  Burra people expect that the line will usher in a new era for them.  Agriculture, sheep farming and mining will all benefit greatly.  A cloud has been lifted from Kooringa and the prospect of a brighter future has been opened to her.
