Bob Greet has been raking leaves, picking up rubbish and mowing lawns around the town to keep it tidy ever since he retired in 1994.  He began work at 13, fencing with his father.  In 1961, at 18, he joined the E & WS Department and later the Highways Department.  He cleans up after football and netball matches and mows the grass at the Burra Showgrounds.  He puts out the bins for the Golf Club, Sports Complex, Town Hall and Burra Ambulance.  The town has acknowledged his work with a KESAB Commendation Award in 2000, an Australia Day Certificate of Appreciation in 2001 and he was named Citizen of the Year in 2004.
