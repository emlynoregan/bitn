Paxton Square Cottages

The Paxton Square Cottages Operations Committee has recommended the new Council Committee to manage the cottages be known as the Lewis Board and Council has adopted this recommendation.  In 1913 the Hon. John Lewis bought the cottages at auction from the South Australian Mining Assoc. and formed the Lewis Trust to administer the leasing of the cottages to indigent and deserving people.  The trust was incorporated before his death in 1923.  A Parliamentary Bill in 1980 enabled the cottages to be vested in the District Council of Burra Burra.  The Lewis Trust then became the Lewis Board of Management with Cr Andrew Gebhardt as Chairman.  Thirty years on the name will continue.  Council is now calling for applications from residents for positions on the seven member board.
