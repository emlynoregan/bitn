Kooringa News, 15 June

On 13 June, Whit Monday, two elevens of the Burra Cricket Club played a game.  The Tradesmen batted first in bad weather.  A heavy drizzle was right in their faces and as a result they managed only 26, including byes.  The Miners then batted in fine conditions and scored 76.  The Tradesmen scored 73 in their second innings; mainly due to James Wilson’s 47.  The Miners got the 26 [sic] to win with 5 or six wickets in hand.  Stephen Thomas was the highest scorer on the winning side, with 44 n.o.

Trade remains very quiet, with the rain preventing drays from getting on the roads.

An Association has been formed to supply butcher’s meat under the management of Mr H. Eddy, an old butcher.  The concern seems to be flourishing.  [The Anti-Butchers Association.]
