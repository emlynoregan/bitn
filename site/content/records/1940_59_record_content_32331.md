Burra Town Council, 7 July

Cr Marston said that a careful look at the town finances revealed the town was ‘broke’.  It should not have happened, but it was now time to look at how to fix it rather than start blaming past actions.

The Mayor requested that Council discuss its financial position.  He said they had come to the end of their finances and something would have to be done.  Payments that night would bring the Council beyond the limit of their allowed overdraft.  The bank had suggested the £400 swimming pool sum be used as collateral for a loan.  He had advised increasing the rates at the start of the 1946-47 financial year, but it had not been done.  Adelaide City Council Had increased its rate from 2/9 to 3/6½.

The Clerk pointed out that rates in Adelaide were payable by 30 November, but not in the country till 28 February.

Cr T.H. Woollacott suggested ratepayers be requested to pay their rates quickly after notification.

Cr S.J. Woollacott moved they raise a loan on the £400 as collateral.  Cr Bevan seconded and the motion was eventually carried.

The Clerk said they would need a motion applying for an overdraft of £675 for a quarter of the Council’s revenue for a year plus £400 on the security for a total of £1,075.

Cr T.H. Woollacott said if they approached the Minister of Local Government for permission for a larger overdraft they risked a Commissioner being appointed.

The Council has offered the CWA use of the Lodge Room at the Town Hall for 20 years at an annual rental of 2/6.  It is expected they will turn it into a rest room and renovate the dynamo room and the passageway adjoining.

All sections of the town had to be treated fairly and basing rates on unimproved land values had to be looked at.  He believed that it would be fairer than the present annual rental value system.  The present system penalised a person for building a good house and improving the town, while the person who made no attempt to improve a block was charged the minimum rate – it was possible for it to be as low as 2/8 p.a. on a rental basis of £1.  The Council had to provide the same services to the empty block as it did to the improved block.  He provided illustrations using Land Tax Records and using 1928 as a base year.

In 1928 unimproved value of Burra was £97,857 and annual rental value £17,394.

The highest rate on unimproved values is 1/- in the £ and on rental is 4/- in the £.

On 1928 values a 6d rate on unimproved values would give £2,446-86

A 2/6 rate on annual rental values would yield £2,174-5-0.

In 1932 the assessment of Hann dropped to £14,000 and remained there despite a big rise in property values.  Many houses are assessed too lightly.

Council based its rental values on 5% of property values, so a house valued at £1,500 but assessed at £900 (as some are) returns rates on a rental value of £45 instead of £75.

To be fair the town needed a new assessment if rates were to be based on annual rental values.  This would cost c. £140 (equivalent to a 2d rate).

If it is changed to the unimproved land value system they could use the Land Tax Department folios for 8d each – a total cost to Council of c. £60.  Appeals and their attendant costs would be the responsibility of the Land Tax Department.

Advice is to be sought on this from the relevant Government Departments.
