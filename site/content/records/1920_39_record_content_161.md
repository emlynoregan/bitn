A.J. McBride writes objecting to Council’s dispensing with Mr Wilks’ services, but giving Mr Davey £180.  Was it fair for Mr Davey to seek £20 more p.a. for two days service a week and one evening a fortnight?  He assumes that with the new position Mr Davey will give up his other agencies and secretaryships to concentrate on his new job.
