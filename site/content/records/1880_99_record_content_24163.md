Editorial.  1886 Remembered.

A time of ‘not merely financial, but moral panic.’

The failure of the Commercial Bank.

Troubles also with various Building Societies and the Town & Country Bank.

The year ended with two banks in liquidation and a number of wealthy men insolvent or nearly so.

A year of deepening commercial depression.

The crops, which looked so good, suffered much from late drought in most areas - at best it was a marking-time crop.

Gold at Teetulpa has been encouraging, even if so far it has cost more to get that it was worth.

Wool prices are up a bit.

‘The Kaleidoscopic Ministry’ has changed much throughout the year, but is nominally the same Government - weak and indecisive.

Adelaide has been linked by rail to Victoria.

The Silverton Railway has about reached the NSW border.

There was hope of silver at World’s End, but it was to come to nothing.

Internationally the year started with a scare of war with Russia and ended with ongoing tension in the Balkans and the continuing saga of the Irish Question.

The outlook for 1887:

For SA the year ahead looks a little brighter.

For Burra the railway to Silverton will cut off a great deal of trade that used to come through the town from the NE and reduces jobs for teamsters and for the farmers and others who supported and maintained them.

The traders in the town survived the closure of the mine in 1877 better than expected: the test may come with this later loss of trade.
