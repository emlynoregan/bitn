Burra Community Library will be one of seven libraries visited by 40 librarians on a trip through the Barossa Valley and Mid North and Yorke Peninsula.  The plan is to give the teacher librarians and teachers a chance to see and hear new ideas.  The visitors will stay overnight in Paxton Square Cottages.
