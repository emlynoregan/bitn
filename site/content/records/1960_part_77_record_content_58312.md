Thomas Pickett Memorial.  On Wednesday the plaque fixed to a counterweight from the old mine workings was dedicated by S.J. Woollacott to the shepherd, Thomas Pickett, who discovered the Burra Mine.  Burra School children were among those who witnessed the event near Diprose Creek opposite the remains of Pickett’s hut.  The President of the Burra Burra Branch of the National Trust introduced Mr Ian Auhl who recounted the story of Thomas Pickett.  Mr S.J. Woollacott made the dedication and Mr Warren Bonython moved the vote of thanks to the Burra Burra Branch.  [Auhl’s speech is printed.]

Pickett came to the area in 1842 to live in his shepherd’s hut alongside the springs in Diprose creek.  There had been no memorial in Burra to the Cornish Miners, or to the Welsh or German Smelters until a recent memorial in Market Square.  Burra was for twenty years SA’s second largest town with a peal population of 5,000 and was for 12 years SA’s only industrial town, with its smelting works.  The present Government seems to favour Wallaroo, Kadina and Moonta as SA’s historic towns, but Burra contains the greatest collection of original buildings still in existence of any town in Sa and has Australia’s oldest mining buildings.  Captain Hancock came to Burra to get his first Moonta miners and the first Headmaster of Moonta Mines School was an old Burra boy Dr William Toor [sic: for Torr].  The scene her is little changed from 1842 when Pickett lived here.  Only a few stones of his hut now remain.

Colonel Frome, SA’s Surveyor General would have seen it when he passed in 1842.  Once a month Pickett would yoke up his bullocks and go to Gum Creek Station 14 miles away to report to the Station manager William Robinson, get his stores, tobacco and rum and return to his hut.  He was paid 12/- a week, most of which went to pay for his rations.  The nearest village was then Gawler 75 miles away, with just nine houses.  Pickett’s hut was then the furthest dwelling north.  Another shepherd, William Streair lived eight miles south, where Princes Royal Homestead now stands and where some Indian coolies also worked for the leaseholder Mr James Stein.  Both shepherds learnt to recognise copper ore after the Kapunda Mine opened in 1843 and in 1845 both found it, but all they ever made of the discovery was £20 each.

[Auhl had documented Pickett’s story in a booklet published by the Burra National Trust and which was given to most of those present.]

Pickett’s story is one of almost unbelievable meanness on the part of the proprietors of the SA Mining Association.  The Burra Mine began on 29 September 1845 and closed on 29 September 1877.  Pickett showed his discovery to a group who had ridden north to see Streair’s find.  He was paid £10 for revealing the site.  A month later the 20,000 acres had been paid for and surveyed.  At the mine’s opening ten miners were present:

Robert Mitchell	Grant

Gillard	R. Jones Jnr

Jenkins	R. Jones Sen

William Roberts	I. Crillas (a blacksmith to sharpen picks)

Jonathon Roberts	Carter
