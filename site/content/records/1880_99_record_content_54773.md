The Salvation Army Demonstration coinciding with the Burra Show was a great success.  There was a meeting at the Showgrounds followed by a well patronised tea.  The evening meeting was also well attended.  The demonstration realised about £22.  The Barracks were opened on 15 April 1885 and cost c. £700, most of which has been paid off.
