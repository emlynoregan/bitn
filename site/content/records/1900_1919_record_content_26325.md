Women’s Branch of National Defence League held a social at the Institute on 25 February when Hon. J. Lewis presided.  Mr Bakewell, President of the ANL*, which supported Gordon Charlston & Shannon for the House of Representatives addressed the meeting.  The great question was Commonwealth finances because more money was needed for the old age pension and for defence.  He believed that Labor men were not entitled to power in the [SA] House of Assembly.  A district like Burra should be governed by representatives of the NDL.

[*The Australian National League would appear to have been an alternative name for the National Defence League.]

Miss Farr spoke on the inappropriateness of the Labor Party to represent the district.

Hon. R.W. Foster urged the ladies to educate their children in the ways of politicians just as the Labor Party did their children.  He was against revolutionary socialism and pointed to Broken Hill and Newcastle as examples of Labor’s unacceptability.  On the financial referendum they must vote ‘Yes’.

Refreshments and dancing followed.
