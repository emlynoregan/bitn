Burra Library Annual Report 1873-74

We unfortunately lost our librarian during the year, but the position has been ably filled by Mrs Bos.  The library has had new lighting installed this year and is well stocked and that is supplemented by a continuous rotation of box books from the Institutesâ€™ Association.  Adult subscriptions are $3.50 per annum and for juniors just 50 cents.
