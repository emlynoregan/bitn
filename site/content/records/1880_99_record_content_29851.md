[Registered as Catherine Tierney, died 25 September, aged 42.]

Michael Terney, railway labourer:

Live two miles north of Burra at the railway camp near Firewood Creek.  My wife got up at 4 a.m. to go to the W.C.  When she did not return I went to find her and could not do so near the house, nor at the bridge across Firewood Creek, nor at a well in the paddock.  I saw something floating in the dam 100 yards away in the paddock to the north-east.  I eventually managed to get the object out and found it to be my wife.

My mate next door, Mr Harvey, helped me carry her back to the house.  She had not been behaving unusually, nor had she complained about anything.  We had not had an argument and she was not subject to fits.

Others gave supporting evidence.

The conclusion was that the deceased ‘met her death by drowning in a dam . . . but there was no evidence as to the state of her mind at the time.’
