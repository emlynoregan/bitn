Peter Dawson of Sydney writes a letter dated Sydney 20 June 1851.

When I wrote last month I was labouring under the gold fever like many others in Sydney, but my friends have returned to Sydney greatly disappointed.  Then Sydney was all a bustle, but now it is very dull.  The prices of goods and labour are falling and there is no great demand for either.  If you or your friends are thinking of coming, be warned that many have returned from the diggings disappointed.  I spoke to one whom I know to be a good working man.  He had just sold his gold for £10, but it had cost him £20 sterling in silver to get it.  There are thousands at the diggings and prices for flour etc. are falling and flour has of late been cheaper at Bathurst than in Sydney.

‘PS – I see this morning that four vessels from Port Phillip have brought 200 passengers who intend to go to the goldfields.  They must be surprised to see scores of men walking about Sydney starving.  They are now returning from the mines in hundreds.  They say hundreds there are not earning 1/- per day.  Where one man is fortunate, five hundred are unfortunate.  A great many have also burnt their fingers in speculation.

‘I say the gold mines are a complete failure.  And once more may I say, ‘Warn every man you know not to be gulled by false reports.’ June 23, 1851.
