The ‘Schneider’ Engine at the Burra Burra Mine

Thursday 16 September was appointed for setting in motion the largest steam engine yet employed in the colony.

The engine-house is a most substantial building, the engine room being 25 ft long by 18 ft 4 inches wide.  The engine was manufactured at the works of the celebrated Perran Foundry Company in Cornwall and is a beam low-pressure pumping engine of 250 horsepower.  The inside diameter of the cylinder is 80 inches, the stroke in the cylinder is 11 ft and in the shaft is 10 ft; the number of strokes per minute is 9 and each raises 136 imperial gallons, or 1,224 gallons per minute.  The diameter of the pipe through which the water is discharged is 20 inches.  The size of the lift is 20 inches.  The steam power is calculated at 15 lb per square inch in the cylinder.  The engine draws perpendicularly with the main beam over the cylinder, the length of the beam, from the centre of the main gudgeon to the centre of the inside pin, being 17 feet and from the centre of the inside pin to the centre of the outside pin is 15 ft 6 inches.  The depth of beam is 6 ft.  The pump is 19 inches in diameter.  This information was supplied by John Congdon, the principal engineer.

Before the engine was started the Directors gathered outside the engine-house and Mr Henry Ayers, the Secretary, christened the engine the ‘Schneider’, in honour of the principal representative of the Patent Copper Smelting Company, throwing a bottle of champagne at the beam, an example which was followed by the Directors.  Mr Ewbank, one of the Managers of the Patent Copper Company thanked the Directors for the honour they had done Mr Schneider in giving his name to the engine.  The company, having gone through the engine-house retired to the residence of Captain Roach for lunch.

At 7 p.m. there was a grand dinner given by the Directors for the captains of the Mine, the engineers and a large number of the inhabitants of Kooringa, at Mr Barker’s Burra Hotel.

The chair was taken by Mr Paxton, with William Allen on his right and E.B. Gleeson on his left.  The Vice-Chair was taken by Henry Ayers, supported on his right by F.J. Beck and on his left by Mr Ewbank.

The Chairman proposed toasts to the Queen, the Royal Family and the Governor, after which Mr Gleeson sang a son.  Henry Ayers then proposed The Burra Burra Mine.  In doing so he acknowledged the present difficulties created by the lack of labour, but said the Mine was in most flourishing condition and he hope in the course of six months to see shiny days again.

C. Ware sang I’m afloat.

Mr Paxton then proposed Captain Roach and his officers, after which there was a song by Mr Johnson.

Captain Roach responded and praised especially the work of Principal Engineer Mr John Congdon.

There was then a song by Henry Ayers, who then proposed the Patent Copper Company and after a song by Mr Samson, Mr Ewbank responded.  Mr Williams proposed the Directors and Captain Allen.  A song by Mr Gleeson was followed by Captain Allen’s response.  Mr Gleeson proposed Henry Ayers. This was followed by another song from Mr Samson, after which Mr Ayers responded.  Mr Gleeson then proposed Lady Young and the Ladies of South Australia.  Mr Thomas sang and Mr Ewbank returned thanks.  Captain Roach proposed William Paxton, who returned thanks.  Several other toasts were proposed and responded to, including to Rev. Pollitt and Dr Chambers.  The Chairman and Directors withdrew at about 11 p.m., but the remainder of the party enjoyed themselves until the approach of dawn.
