Mining in South Australia (From the London Mining Journal’s correspondent.  Concluded from 14 April.)

[The writer continues from the previous article on 14 April with a digression on the problems posed by the land sale as far as the banking community was concerned and the potential disastrous result of taking £30,000 out of circulation in the colony.  Having explained how the danger was averted, he continues:]

The large sum obtained from this sale will bring out 2,000 migrants, relieving England of her superabundant children, and adding so many additional consumers of British manufactures to this population.

At the Burra Mine the last six weeks’ ‘take’ have produced 5,000 tons of ore from 10 to 45% produce.  The crushing machine has arrived and will soon be at work.  This will allow the opening of a number of pitches in the surface levels, which have hitherto not been touched because of the expense of ‘bucking’ the stuff down.

At the Patent Copper Company the large chimney and the second row of furnaces are fast approaching completion.

The ships which bring out emigrants take copper from here to India on their return; cutting out trade for the Swansea smelters.

[The author goes on to write of the Reedy Creek (Tungkillo) Mine and of some gold from the upper Torrens Valley.  He mentions an engine breakage has allowed the Kapunda Mine to become flooded; a case of penny wise and pound foolish in purchasing an old engine for the job.  He then writes of mines at Paringa and in the Strathalbyn area and concludes with a report that the Royal Mining Company’s shares are now unsaleable.]
