Burra Burra Show Inc.  The President Presents the 88th Annual Report.

The Annual Show was held on 6 October in vile, cold and windy conditions with hail.  The gate takings fell to £145-17-0, aided by £16-4-6 from the dance conducted by the Rural Youth Club.  Entries were numerous (2,500).  Exhibits in the main hall benefited from the fine improvements carried out by Mr R. Fuss.  For the first time a buffet lunch was served for official guests, which proved successful.  Membership remains steady, but the financial position has deteriorated.

Burra Small Bore Club.  The best results over double 75 yards came from W. Corner, P. Mengersen and M. Alderson.
