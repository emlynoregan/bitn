Telephone Calls

The Director of Posts and Telegraphs has announced that from 1 May the local telephone area has been greatly enlarged.  Previously the local call area for Burra extended for a circle within a radius a little greater than halfway to Mt Bryan or Hanson.  Now it will extend to Clare and Watervale in the west, to beyond Robertstown in the southeast and beyond Booborowie, Willalo and Hallett in the north.   [A map of the area is printed.]

The local call cost will be 4d.  Trunk call charges will also change.  Eleven different rates will become eight and the minimum charge will be 1/4.
