Redruth Girls Reformatory

The girls departed on Friday last 4 August for Enfield where they will be under the care of the Salvation Army.  They were seen off at the station by Miss Bubb and Miss Tyrie & M-C Johns of Redruth.  Two women police and three constables escorted them.  Nothing has been heard of what is to become of the building.
