Editorial on ‘An Iniquitous By-Law’

The editor writes at length (1 column) against the new hawking by-law which has passed Council, but now need Parliamentary approval.  He objected because:

It is so complicated that the real working of it is unfathomable.

It has not been asked for by ratepayers.  (Except those in business who will benefit.)

Cr Hardy intimated recently ‘That if the inspector did not catch woodcarters he need not deal with them.’  This surely implies that the law is aimed at certain hawkers only, so that two or three ratepayers can benefit at the expense of the rest.

Now is the time for ratepayers to act.  They need to request a public meeting.
