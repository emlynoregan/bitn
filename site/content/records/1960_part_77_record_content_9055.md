Burra CWA celebrated its 35th birthday and International Day on 17 November.  Mr A.L. Clode on behalf of himself and his family presented a beautiful President’s Chair [or perhaps a table – depending on which sentence you are reading in the report!] in memory of his wife who was a member for many years.  It was decided to donate £75 to the Annual Hospital Fund Appeal.  The guest speaker was Mrs R. Murray of Stockport, Divisional President of the Lower North Division, who spoke on Famous Australians.
