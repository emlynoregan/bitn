Editorial: The Roseworthy-Forresters Railway

The present program aims to see the inauguration of the railway to Forresters in June, of the Port Wakefield line in September and of the Burra extension in November.  The Commissioner of Public Works visited two of the lines last week and a Register reporter went along.  On leaving the Adelaide Station we could see the new line parallel to the Northern line, but leading to Bowden Junction.  This has just been completed.  We dashed to Gawler at 40 m.p.h.  Within and hour of leaving Adelaide we had reached Roseworthy where we crossed the downward train.  Here were huge piles of sleepers waiting to be despatched to the Burra extension line and we entered upon the Roseworthy-Forresters branch.  Several miles of this have been available for wheat traffic for some weeks.  Impatient farmers and dealers are already complaining that the line’s resources are in adequate.  At first the line runs through rich farming country before entering a stretch of scrubby country.  Farmers here are battling to clear land.  More might be turned to agriculture were it not for the restrictive price of £1 per acre.  Embankments and cuttings are few.  The sleepers are stout sawn gum, with over 2,100 allocated per mile.  The ballast is limestone.  The fencing of strands of wire with straining posts every 600 yards.  The intermediate supports are too flimsy and in future iron T posts will be employed.  Wasleys station is substantial and superior to others on the line for no apparent reason and its erection has cost some £600 to £700 beyond the limit.  Beyond here the line skirts wheat fields.  A quarter of a mile from the River Light the engine had to descend upon unballasted rails, a slope rendered by an extensive cutting, somewhat less formidable than it naturally appears.  The train halted just a few yards before the impressive structure of the Hamley Bridge, just on the eve of completion. The valley here is 300 ft wide and the river is crossed at a height of 80 ft.  The abutments are of firm white Kapunda sandstone.  The central support is a cylindrical pier 6 ft in diameter and 70 ft high.  [Rather more detail is then provided about the Hamley Bridge.]  The foundation stone of the bridge was laid by Mrs Hamley ten months ago and the line across it will be inaugurated in a month.

After half an hour the inspection continued by buggy.  Two or three miles beyond Stockport we came upon plate-layers completing the permanent way.

Forresters, the nominal terminus of the line, lies nearly a mile away from the actual terminus at Tarlee, where the forerunners of a town – an inn, a blacksmith’s shop and a Methodist Chapel – are already to be seen.  A skeleton of a station has been erected.  The plate-layers will be here within a few days and not many weeks will pass before they continue onto the Burra Extension.  The Commissioner is hopeful of having the line laid to Burra in time for next season’s wheat traffic and for the reopening of the Burra Mine.
