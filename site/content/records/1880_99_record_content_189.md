Crop Yields.  Despite the generally good year for crops the eastern part of the Hundred of Baldina has yielded nothing.  Examples: -

last year 700 acres for 17 bags; this year 800 acres at 3 bushels per acre

last year 250 acres for 28 bags; this year 300 acres at 1Â½ bushels per acre

last year 140 acres for 8 bags; this year 240 acres at 1 bushel per acre

Another farmer who sowed 20 bags reaped 15 and one who sowed 80 bags reaped 45.

Last year rabbits were to blame, but this year it was insufficient rain.

In the west of Baldina the yield averaged 10 bushels per acre.
