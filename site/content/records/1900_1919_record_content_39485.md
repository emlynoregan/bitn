Germans.  The first attack in print (in Burra) on locals of German background or origin.

‘Britisher’ of Kooringa writes on 27 October warning of the danger of having Germans in positions of authority and urging all at the coming municipal elections to ‘refuse to vote for any Germans, however much they protest their loyalty . . . let us vote for Britishers who are above suspicion, and in whom we can place the utmost reliance in time of stress and war’.
