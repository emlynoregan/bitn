St Mary’s Church held special services and offerings last Tuesday, All Saints Day, instead of holding a fete.  Holy Communion was held at 7 a.m. and 10 a.m. and both were well attended.  Altar flowers by Miss Doris Fuss, which are always a feature at St Mary’s, were especially beautiful.  There was a Children’s Service at 4.30 p.m. and Festal Evensong at 8 p.m. with Rev. C.W. Pegg of Riverton assisted by Rev. W.B. Kenworthy of Auburn and Rev. A.L. Bulbeck of Clare, Rev. W.K. Ray of Koolunga and Rev. M.C.W. Gooden of Balaklava.  The offerings amounted to £150-2-8.
