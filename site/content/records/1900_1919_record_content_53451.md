Characteristics of the 1917 paper.

Page 1.

Large advertisements: mostly local.

Page 2.

A few larger advertisements in columns 1-2, then notices, small advertisements, classifieds and the beginning of news.  Rarely any editorial.

Page 3.

The news continues with a few larger local advertisements.

War news, mainly about ‘Our Boys’ and patriotic efforts at home dominate the paper.

The Town & District Roll of Honour is printed most weeks.

Page 4.

A mixture of smaller advertisements for local businesses, patent medicines etc.

Several columns of news and articles.   The latter are of a more general, as opposed to local, interest.  Often they relate to patriotic matters, the recruiting drive and pro-conscription propaganda.

Letters from the front or from those on leave or in hospital were common on pages 3 and 4.

This year there was little sporting activity to report for obvious reasons, and not much reporting of the little that did take place.  Patriotic activities dominated all else.

Paper was hard to get and there were few supplements as a result.
