Burra Town Council

A.L. Bence, Walker & Son and F. Harris petitioned against the parking ban in Market Square near their shops, as it interfered with business.

Cr Kellaway gave notice to rescind the ban.

There was discussion about pedestrians, especially at night using the road rather than the footpath to Aberdeen and the consequent danger to them of being struck by vehicles.

A move is being made to see if a by-law could ban walking on the road.

The Town Clerk reported the Government’s subsidy of £ for £ on Christmas Relief work.  50 men have been given work.

The Highway Dept. has allowed the Council to put cyclone wire on the Redruth Bridge. (At Council expense.)

The Mayor drew attention to A.B. Riggs’ recent letter about the confusion over the town’s name.  He was in favour of Kooringa Post Office changing to Burra and Aberdeen to Burra North.
