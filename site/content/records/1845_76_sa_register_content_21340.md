An inquest was held at the residence of Mr Richard Hallett, Wandillah, near Kooringa, before Mr MacDermott SM into the fire in Cobb & Co.’s paddock on 10 November.

William Nottle: was employed mowing wheat for Cobb & Co. and saw a man leaving the source of the fire.  Saw the fire half an hour after in the corner near Mr Hallett’s Run.  It was extinguished before I got there.  Discovered at its source a piece of paper, the nearly burnt wick of a tallow candle and some green wheat recently pulled up, forming a windbreak for the candle.

James McEwen gardener at Mr Hallett’s corroborated the above and so did other witnesses, though only Nottle had seen a man in the area.  The jury concluded the fire had been maliciously lit by a person or persons unknown.
