Burra Burra DC is concerned at the cut to roads grants.  For the past five years the Council had received $200,000 annually to upgrade the Spalding-Burra Road and the Burra-Morgan Road.  Nothing has been allocated for 1985-86.  They were not made aware of this cut to Arterial Road Grants until after they had framed their budget.  Despite appeals to MPs and the Highways Department there has so far been no explanation for the cut.  Cr Des Woolley said the Council had been ‘at war’ with the Department over the sealing of the Burra-Morgan road for some years.  It was only after a fatality on the road several years ago that finds were allocated.  Tour operators avoid running their buses on the road, he said.  Council has also received a 13% cut in funding for other roads; down to $61,000 from $70,000 in 1984.  Verbal advice from the Chairman of the Local Roads Advisory Committee had led them to expect a 10% increase.
