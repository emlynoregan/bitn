Barrier Highway Closed

Following heavy rains in the north last week, flood waters have damaged the Pine Creek Bridge on the Barrier Highway 8 km west of Cockburn.  As a consequence the Barrier Highway is closed indefinitely pending repairs and traffic to Broken Hill is being diverted via the Riverland and Wentworth.
