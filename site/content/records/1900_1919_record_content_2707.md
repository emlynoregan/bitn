Burra Races on 30 January were a success.  The day was unpleasantly windy in the morning, but it dropped in the afternoon.  There was a good attendance and every event ran on time.  Mr J.C. Heinjus’s Sunbeam, ridden by A.D. Cochrane, won both the Burra Handicap [1st got £20] and The Flying Handicap [1st got £12.  The value of prizes comes from paper of 23 Jan., p.2].  The course was good and the whole meeting a great success.
