Editorial on The New Railway Timetable.

This is causing problems.  In its favour it is a boon to be able to the city earlier and to the Peninsula in one day.  But the disadvantages are: -

1.	The first train from Adelaide leaves so late it delays all morning mail for businesses.

2.	The last train from the north is too early for business hours.
