Avian & Freda Pink will leave Burra in the first week of April.

Avian has been heavily involved with the National Trust, the Men’s Agricultural Bureau, BRTBA, Burra Tennis Club, Burra Tourism Association and Probus.  Freda’s interests have included BRTBA, MNRDB, National Trust, Women’s Bowls, Tourism Advisory Committee, Burra Tourism Association and the Women’s Agricultural Bureau.  She has been a Mid North Regional Councillor and editor of WAB Newsletter and has been involved with TAFE as well as being a JP and marriage celebrant.  They are retiring to Ardrossan.

Avian’s great grandfather worked and had land here in the 1860s.  When mining slowed down he went to work on Buttermuck Station out of Dawson.  Later he and his family returned to Clare and founded F. Pink & Sons (now Mitre 10), one of the few Mid North businesses still owned and managed by his descendants.  After farming in Hill River for nearly 30 years, Avian and Freda bought Basin Farm in 1977 and moved here in 1982; selling the farm to Graham and Elspeth Radford in 1985.  They then bought and ran the Mobil Roadhouse until December 1988 and early in 1989 opened Burra View House as a B & B.  Its new owners will take this over at the end of March this year.  [Photo.]
