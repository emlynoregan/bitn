Thomas B. Ashton writes that following recent comments of the Hospital Board members that he could return to the hospital ‘if he likes to apply and comply with the rules’ he wrote congratulating Dr Steele on getting his salary increased from £75 to £120.  He then goes over the grounds given for his dismissal in 1917 and specifically goes over the cancer case where he arranged for an operation and then failed to carry it out because, as he said, the patient had suddenly grown worse and the operation was inappropriate.  The real reason for his dismissal he says was the disinclination of the Board to strengthen the staff when medical officers thought it essential.
