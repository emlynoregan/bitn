James Tie, a Chinese gardener of Black Waterholes, met with a serious accident on his way home on

Saturday.  He lost control of his horse and dray on an incline near his garden and the dray capsized.  He was thrown into the creek where he lay unconscious for some hours.  He was found by his wife who then sent for Mr Reed who conveyed him to the Burra Hospital.  He remains unconscious with a concussion that seems likely to prove fatal.  He is aged 40. [Note that in the report of his death in the next issue he is said to be 48.]
