Richard Reed turned 86 on Monday.  He was born in Lostwithel [sic] Cornwall in 1837 and came to Australia aged 10 with his parents and they went to Kapunda for 12 months before coming to Burra where their first home was in the bank of the Burra Creek.  He was employed ore picking and then became a whim-driver.  Later, with the late Joseph Sleep, he was a tributer.  He had a brief and unsuccessful visit to the Victorian goldfields and on his return got a bullock team and carted wood for the mine.  In 1863 he bought Wandillah Estate now held by his youngest son, James.  He survived a 3-year drought.  He retired c. 20 years ago.  In 1858 he married Miss Henwood who died in 1914.  Three sons and three daughters survive.  The sons, Richard, John & James are pastoralists.  The daughters are Mrs C. Bartholomaeus, Mrs George Sara and Mrs W.H. Gare, with whom he lives.
