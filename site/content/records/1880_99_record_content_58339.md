Cr Hardy is spreading lies about the assessment.  He has rushed into print and says John Lewis is assessed at £20 and Dr Brummitt at £42.  In fact the former is assessed at £50 and the latter at £42.  ‘Another proof of our previous assertion, viz, figures are beyond the noted “Billy”.’

‘Nevertheless it is a scandalous thing for him to use his “inability” to hoodwink the ratepayers.’
