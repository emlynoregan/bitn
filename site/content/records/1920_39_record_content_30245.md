Tom Canny of Gum Creek post office also replies to Mr Pearse and says the officials of the Racing Club were conspicuously absent from the Catholic Picnic Races on 2 March – perhaps on that occasion he was a ‘Conscientious Objector’.  He does however agree that both meetings suffered from a singular absence of townspeople.
