Midland Road Board at Riverton Court House 9 August: a special meeting to consider the route of the road from Kooringa to North West Bend via Baldina.

The Clerk read the notice in the Government Gazette 13 July of the intention to approve a deviation of road 92 via Redruth.

Cr Warnes & J.A. Goodfellow attended on behalf of J. Harris, SA Mining Association and Burra District Council, to protest this deviation.

Mr Warnes said nearly all the land in Baldina lay south of the existing track and only 10% on the north side.  All the traffic south of the track would naturally go by Mr Cowper’s head station and thence to a point at the corner of section 224.  If the road were diverted and laid down via Diprose’s Creek this traffic would have to go round from that corner 38 chains 74 links to get into the road then 335 chains to get into Aberdeen and 78 chains from there to Kooringa.  In all 452 chains.

By the road already surveyed the same point was 316 chains from Kooringa thus representing an extra distance inwards and outwards of 4 miles 28 chains against the proposed deviation.  Kooringa contained most of the public buildings – Post & Telegraph Office, Institute, Hospital and Cemetery.  The proposed deviation would saddle the Burra District Council with an expensive piece of road.

The road need not go over Breakneck Hill, but by an easier route up Nankivell’s Gully and thence southeast over the saddle in the hills, with no severe gradients and the distance about the same.

The Burra District Council did not care whether the road went directly into Kooringa or round by Redruth they only wanted to get the present road off their shoulders.  The Nankivells’ Gully route would require two bridges compared with five in the proposed deviation via Diprose’s Creek.  Mr Harris objected to having his paddock cut into two or three pieces as required by the new deviation.

Mr Moule thought the road would have to start at the post office.  He said the extra distance to Kooringa via Diprose’s Creek would be three-quarters of a mile longer, but it would be 74 chains shorter to the railway station.  He also said that the Act required the road to go from Kooringa to North West Bend via Baldina, so it would have to start in Kooringa.

Mr Warnes pointed out that to start at the post office it would have to travel over a mile of main road 14.

Mr Goodfellow, as Clerk of the District Council, produced a letter from the District Council to the Commissioner of Crown Lands in September 1874 requesting the road be from the Burra Railway Station to North West Bend.  The letter pointed out that the wording of the Bill as it was could apply to either one of two roads, or to a road and a track.

The Commissioner then had the Bill amended to read from Kooringa via Baldina to the North West Bend.  The Commissioner thought that removed any ambiguity.

Mr Warnes said the present road had been surveyed by the Council and approved by the Governor.  The Board did not propose to close the old road, merely to leave it, whereupon it would become a burden to the Council.

Mr Bakewell appeared to represent John Drew and others.  He argued that the change in the Legislative Council to read from Kooringa instead of from the Railway Station meant that the Board had no power to make the road from Redruth as suggested and if they proceeded, he believed their decision could be set aside by the Supreme Court.

Mr P. Lane and Captain Sanders appeared for the Burra Corporation [Town Council].  Mr Lane said Kooringa had 1,500 to 2,000 residents – more than Redruth and Aberdeen combined – and ought not to be ignored.  The District Council favoured the road via Nankivell’s Gully, which would serve nearly all those who would be served by the proposed road into Redruth, except for about 12 houses.  The road via Diprose’s Creek would cost a great deal more to make it passable.

Captain Sanders also said the route via Diprose’s Creek would cost considerably more and he supported the route recommended by Messrs Warnes and Lane.  He said about 25,000 tons of firewood was brought in annually.

Mr Ridgway presented a memorial with 149 signatures in favour of the deviation via Diprose’s Creek.  The inhabitants for whom he appeared believed the Board had gone carefully into the matter and had reached the correct conclusion.  [He used statistics of loads and costs to bolster his opinion.]

Mr Butterworth supported the road via Redruth.  He believed the road recommended by the Board was the best and did not see why wood and wheat should pass through Kooringa.

Mr Tiver also supported the Redruth road.  The route over Breakneck Hill would cost more in maintenance than the making of the other.  The Redruth road had easier gradients.

Messrs G. Sara & A. Bartholomæus supported Mr Ridgway’s memorial.

Mr Warnes argued that if the road went to Redruth a great proportion of the traffic would have to come back to the Mine and to Kooringa.
