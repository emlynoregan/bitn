A Review of Council Proceedings

On 5 December 1892 there was a special meeting of the incoming Council and from then on there was a coolness between the Mayor and Councillors.

4 January.  Cr Hardy caused the first unpleasantness.  Early in the year a breakage at the Waterworks caused the water to stop flowing for a day or two.  To publish how long the break was likely to be we asked the Town Clerk who gave the information.  Cr Hardy then made a fuss about the Town Clerk’s right to give such information and he tried to make it hot for the engineer as well, assisted by Cr Kitchen.  Cr Linkson fell out with the Mayor over one of his rulings and when he was later cut short he moved ‘That the Council be censured for their conduct re the breakage at the Waterworks.’  It was clear that the Mayor could not grasp the situation and since then the Council proceedings have been of a unique and sensational character.

16 January.  The mayor produced a report which abused the Record in which the editor was charged with misrepresentation and the Mayor demanded the printing of his report or he would get it done elsewhere and distributed.  The paper published it verbatim.

[Because of the many ridiculous errors and the sarcastic comments added by the editor this inflamed the situation.]

Cr Linkson supported the substantial correctness of the paper’s reports and sought that the Mayor’s report be not received.

6 February.  Another hot meeting debated the receiving and adoption of the report.  Cr Parks moved that it be received, but gave notice that at the next meeting he would move it be expunged from the minute book.
