Beyond the rainfall country everything is new and strange except to very few persons.

Squatting on the inside of the line is easy and profitable.  Settlers live like gentlemen and see a yearly accumulating balance at their bankers.  On the other side it is all hard work, unceasing toil, meagre fare and disappointed hopes with pecuniary losses.  Between the ‘up’ squatters and the ‘down’ squatters there is a great gulf.  Beyond the line when rain comes they come from the northeast, but south of it they come from the southwest.

On Saturday 22 June I was deputed by the proprietors of the Register and the Observer to attend a meeting of settlers at Tetulpa [sic: Teetulpa], a station belonging to Mr Chewings about 211 miles from Adelaide.  I took the train to Kapunda and then the North-eastern Mail.  It had rained in the north and the mail from the country beyond Mt Remarkable was two days late in reaching Burra and many hair-raising stories were told of its journey, including the abandonment of the coach and the mail guard having to swim with the bags.

At about 10 o’clock the coach left Kapunda for Burra.  The road, though being improved, was sloppy and sticky.  We passed through the ‘towns’ of Hamilton, Marrabel, Steelton, Waterloo and Black Springs.  Burra was reached in good time and I was comfortably lodged at Lamb’s Hotel [Burra Hotel].

Because of the bad roads beyond we had to start at 5 a.m.  ‘Tom Colley’ was on the box and we set off.  We stopped for breakfast at Mt Bryan Inn for 15 minutes.  The Cobb & Co. vehicle was comfortable and travelled easily – a great improvement on the square box with heavy springs formerly in use.  We made it to the end of the stage at a gallop.  Not twenty yards beyond the changeover we were buried to the axletree in mud and only with great difficulty extracted.  Once on firm land again we travelled at ten miles per hour to Gottlieb’s Wells, Mr A. McCulloch’s Station, right on the boundary of the rainy and dry country.  There was half an hour to change horses.  The country was becoming generally poorer, with less feed and more bare patches showing themselves.
