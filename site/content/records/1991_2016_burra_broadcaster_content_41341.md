The 2015 Burra AGL Country Music Festival.

Held over the weekend of 6-8 November, this event was a resounding success and the outstanding weather helped to boost numbers significantly, with an average attendance of c. 1,500 over the three-day event.  More local faces were in the crowd this year.  The opening show on Friday departed from the traditional country music theme, to concentrate on rock and roll hits from the 60s and 70s, with the ‘Party Cats’.  This had the audience dancing most of the night, led by the Renmark Rock ʼn’ Roll Dancers.  The band included Peter Tilbrook (lead guitarist), from the ‘Master’s Apprentices’ and John Bywaters (bass guitarist) from ‘The Twighlights’, both from highly acclaimed rock bands of the era.

Saturday night’s program was more traditional country music.  Tracey Rains and Claypan Band were part of a high class line-up that included Paul Costa and Aleyce Simmonds, Dwayne Elix, Gina Timms and Bill Gray, with local South Australian stars, Nathaniel O’Brien, Megan Laurie, Tanya Cornish, Shane Johnson and Juliet Oliver.  A surprise act on Saturday night was the Burra Village People – John Turner, Chris Rains, Trevor Keilar, Michael Jones, Dwayne Elix and Shane Johnson.

The festival brought many visitors and boosted local businesses.  Overall the event was an outstanding success.  Sadly the festival came to an early end on Sunday afternoon, when news was received that 19-year-old Burra singer Nathaniel O’Brien had been killed in a car accident while travelling to Adelaide, after completing has Sunday morning Gospel Music session.  Audience members observed a one minute silence before departing the showground.
