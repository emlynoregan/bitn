Burra Town Council

Glenister & Sams offered to supply electricity to four street lamps at £4 p.a. each, up to 10.30 p.m.

Near Bright & Bright’s office

One in Queen St

One in the rotunda

One on the National Bank Corner

Mr Winnall was re-appointed Council solicitor.

Four special constables were appointed for New Year.

The Inspector reported that only about 5% of new trees survived the winter frosts.  Pines had been wiped out.  Carobs were hardier.  Some kind of bug seems to have attacked the pines.

Rough treatment of the Market Square pump by young fellows had rendered it out of order.

There was a discussion on foot bridges at the White Hart and the ‘Pig & Whistle’ fords, but no resolution.

Stock trespassing into Aberdeen plantations was a problem.
