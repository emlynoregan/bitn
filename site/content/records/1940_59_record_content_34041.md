Burra Town Council

A new assessment will be made for the Council area to correct anomalies that have arisen due to the many years since the last assessment.  It will be based on rental values.

Burra Rifle Club.  The heavy barrels ordered have arrived.

Wool.  Mr E. Finch of Pencarrow obtained the high price of 55¾d per lb for 5 bales of wool at the 1947-48 Adelaide Wool Sales recently.

The £400Swimming Pool money is not available for the War Memorial Scheme.  It was borrowed in 1937 in a scheme in which, when the work was completed, the State Government would pay back one third and the Federal Government one third.  For various reasons the matter was delayed and then deferred indefinitely by the war.  The Under-Treasurer advises that as the money had already been paid no loan now existed, but another similar loan could be arranged.  It was decided to seek legal advice and pay the £400 on hand back into general revenue.

The Springtime Ball on Thursday evening at the Town Hall in aid of the Burra Hospital Drive also celebrated the marriage of HRH Princess Elizabeth & Lieut. Philip Mountbatten.

Bowls.  At Burra on Saturday: Burra Gold 107 defeated Auburn 105.

At Clare on Saturday: Burra Green 87 defeated Clare Red 86.

National Eisteddfod.  Only nine entries from Burra appeared for the audition, so there will not be a broadcast from Burra.  There will instead be a broadcast from Clare tonight.

The Royal Wedding was celebrated by a gathering of about 200 boys and girls in Market Square on Thursday when the Mayor & Mayoress treated them to large ice creams and oranges from the various cool drink shops in Burra.

Music Exam Results for Mr Clem Davey’s students are printed.
