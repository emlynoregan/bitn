Burra & District Tourist Promotion Committee held its AGM in the Burra Town Hall on 26 April, but a low attendance caused a decision to re-convene on 28 May at the Town Hall.  Provision of improved facilities and information needs to be sorted out as well as arrangements for the 1973 Copper festival.
