Editorial on West Burra Copper mining Co.

Is it possible to resuscitate the glory of the past mining era in Burra with the development of an adjacent lode?  The indications of a rich find are there from assay results.  Why let outsiders pick up the shares when anything from Â£1 up will buy a parcel of them?  At those prices, even if it comes to nothing, no one would lose much.  The money will be spent in the district.
