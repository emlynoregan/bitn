Mr J.G. Carpenter wanted the eradication of noxious weeds enforced.

Mr R. Jennison thought the Aberdeen Playground was in a sad state and Mr W.H. Lloyd (Committeeman) said the swings were in a sorry state, but some new equipment had been added.  There were also questions on cemetery upkeep.

Mr D.T. Jacka, in commenting on town progress, said 24 new homes had been built in Burra since the war.

Mr R.M. Reed asked about the whereabouts of funds donated for school crossing lights that had not eventuated.  The Mayor blamed the previous Town Clerk for inaction here [and for lack of action on cleaning water-tables.]

Dr Pitcher supported the Mayor, saying they had been led to believe there were complications involved, but recent discussions with the Highways Department suggested there would not be difficulties and the matter was being taken up again.  Mr Woollacott queried the competence of the Council in blaming the former Town Clerk for inadequacies and Mr Baulderstone said he would not stand again and so give the town a chance to install a capable Council.

Mr Jennison proposed a vote of thanks to the Mayor and hoped Mr Baulderstone would reconsider his decision regarding a further term as Mayor.
