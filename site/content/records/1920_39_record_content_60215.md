Burra Burra Show Inc. held its AGM where President I.J. Warnes reported on the year.

During the year they had lost a hard worker when Mr T.H. Bailey died.

The officers were re-elected unopposed.

The Dog Trials and horse events on 26 & 27 April drew a small number of entries.

Several well-attended working bees have attacked the wild onion problem at the showgrounds.  Sheep have carried three corner jacks to the showgrounds from the saleyards.

Members’ subscriptions this year were down by £10.

The annual show this year will be on 3 October to work in with the Centenary Celebrations.

Last year’s annual show on 23 October was in perfect weather and gate receipts were up on previous years.  Entries were well up to previous years.  The profit on operations was £32-1-1.
