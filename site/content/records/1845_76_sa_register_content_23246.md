The Burra Mine

Visitors to Kooringa are still tempted to turn aside and visit the old Burra Burra Mines.  ‘Their wealth and good services to the community must ever be held in grateful remembrance.’

‘No mineral discovery in the future can ever produce do profound an effect as did the finding and development of the Burra Burra.’

Three or four years have worked a marvellous change in the aspect of affairs at the mines. No great time has elapsed since they were appropriately described as a hive of human industry.  Clusters of workmen were engaged in the important duty of digging out the green ore.  Below ground were hundred of miners, one set succeeding the other in perpetual relay.  On the surface nearly as many were employed in the processes of raising, dressing and smelting.  The activity was reflected in the trade of the adjoining townships of Kooringa, Redruth, Aberdeen and half a score of smaller villages, all sharing the prosperity of the SA Mining Association.  The stoppage of the Burra workings was an ill day for them.  Businesses lost the bulk of their custom.  The streets lost much of their traffic.  ‘An appearance of antiquity and the reality of decay settled down upon the whole place.’

The next census returns, if not too long delayed, will place Kooringa in the rank of non-progressive towns.

The electoral rolls show a material decline in the number of qualified voters.  But there are still grounds for predicting a brighter future for Kooringa.  The inhabitants can see that something is being done on a gigantic scale, but they are puzzled by the mysterious preparations now in hand.  At the bottom of the creek in immediate proximity to some of the former excavations, a huge platform 60 feet high has been erected upon pillars formed of the old iron tubing taken from abandoned shafts.  This is flanked at the northern end by an embankment of earth sloping up at an angle of from 45° to 60°.  Judging from appearances this is intended to be the roadway for the trucks bearing the ore obtained from the depths below by the trenching system, which it is understood to be resorted to in place of conventional mining.  To the southwards an embankment has been commenced which onlookers presume is to be carried across the valley to meet the platform before spoken of and to make with it a roadway from the workings to the side of the hill, a distance of some 200-200 yards.  The material is obtained from the vicinity of the platform and is transported on a crude tramway.  The motive power coming from a small engine in a small shed on the hillside.  Already some thousands of loads have been brought over, but as yet a wide gulf separates the embankment from the platform.  Before it can be filled up an enormous pit will have been dug in front of the 45° to 60° slope before mentioned.  It will be almost immediately above some of the old levels and the intention is probably to re-open these and enable all veins, leaders and lodes to be traced without the difficulties to which subterranean mining is subjected.  Since operations have ceased according to the old plan, whole acres of ground have sunk appreciably.  In many places gaping fissures are to be seen and in traversing the area one must exercise extreme care not to be engulfed.  It is said there are scores of thousands of pounds worth of timber buried in the former workings, which will be recovered in the new workings.  The present superintendent is discreetly reticent about just how the ore is to be raised and dressed.    All well-wishers will united in hoping that the spirited attempt to restore the mine to its previous flourishing condition will prosper.  The Directors have also decided to give their former tenants better tenure than previously available and the good effects of this policy will be shown in the erection of a better class of housing and in the establishment of some civic power to take in hand the formation of streets and the enforcement of sanitary regulations.  The want of self-government has long been felt and ought to be supplied without delay.   When the mine is once more in full swing, employing its hundreds of workers, and the agricultural settlement has reached in the North the extend to which it is believed it might advantageously be extended, the prosperity of Kooringa will be greater than ever.
