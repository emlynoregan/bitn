'Thoughtful' writes about the annual drive for Red Cross & FFCF units

Queen competitions are a decided success and gains outweigh temporary and petty jealousies.

Last yearâ€™s division into sections might be hard to repeat with the problem of gaining leaders, and pitting one section of the town against another is perhaps not in the best interests of the community.

Perhaps a better solution would be a series of small committees with specific tasks such as:

A patriotic race meeting or a trotting picnic meeting

A Rodeo

A series of balls

A concert or two

Refreshments at the above.
