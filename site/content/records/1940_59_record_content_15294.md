On Saturday morning 9 October old scholars assembled at the school, some garbed as they would have appeared 40 years ago.  Mrs McDonnell nee Miss Clark, who taught there in 1902, was in charge.  The roll was called and the lesson proceeded.  Lunch was taken at the local hall a la picnic.  In the afternoon childrenâ€™s sports were organised and a mock court was held.
