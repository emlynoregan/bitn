[Actually according to the registration data Elizabeth Esau/Esaw/Easaw married Henry Thomas Hancock on 1 January 1879 at the residence of William Hancock, the groomâ€™s father, at Broughton.  There were five sons and one daughter born either at North Adelaide or the Clare Valley and also he had a son by Ellen Thrush at North Adelaide in 1904.  Since Elizabeth was born at Riverton in 1853 there is no clear Burra connection without further information.]
