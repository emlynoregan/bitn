‘Miss Scarecrow’ writes that tramps have used the seats for firewood and the dressing sheds as a boarding house.  Other small towns have a grandstand, but here nothing.  She suggests vesting the oval in say 8 trustees appointed by the football club (2), cricket club (2), Town Council (2) and townsfolk (2) to erect a grandstand, changing rooms etc.
