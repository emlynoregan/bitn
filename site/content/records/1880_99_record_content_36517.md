Aberdeen Reading Room.  There was a meeting at the Royal Exchange Hotel on Tuesday with Thomas Davies in the chair.

Morland Chaplin, Hon. Sec. reported on progress.  40 subscribers have promised support and have written a letter to the Minister of Education applying for assistance.  The Treasurer, Mr Holder, assures us of his support and says he could guarantee a grant equal to subscriptions.  Any donor of £5-5-0 should get life membership enabling the donation to be deemed a subscription and attracting a subsidy.  The premises available are:

The National Bank, Aberdeen, at 10/- per week for two years which provides two good rooms, fireplaces and a safe.

Store of Mr Bath’s adjacent to the Wesleyan Church Redruth.  This has neither windows, nor a fireplace and is rather dark and cheerless for 6/- per week.

Two rooms 16’ x 16’ and 16’ x 12’ in a house near Rayner’s store: offered by Mr Ridgway for 10/- a week including cleaning and lighting.

Mr Both’s old store next to Mr Austin’s and now used as a school by Mr Young, for use after 4 p.m. Monday-Friday and all day Saturday at 6/- per week including cleaning.  It is well whitewashed and fitted with tables, forms and shelves.  It is clean and light.

He suggested the Burra Literary Society be approached for assistance.  A fair amount of interest has been expressed in the formation of an Aberdeen-Redruth Institute.
