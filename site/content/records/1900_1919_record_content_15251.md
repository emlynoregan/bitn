Mrs Jemison said her husband had recently taken to drink because of severe head pains and the previous Saturday he had experienced a fit and for fifteen minutes they had thought him dead.

The verdict was death by poisoning but with no evidence to show whether by alcohol or strychnine.

[Joseph Richard Jemison was born 28 November 1863 at Pt Elliott and died 5 November 1905 at Kadina.]
