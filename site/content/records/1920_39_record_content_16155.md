Burra Hospital: Opening of the Maternity Wing

For nearly half a century the hospital has proved a boon for the town and district and has ranked as one of the finest country hospitals.  More recently new hospitals at Peterborough, Orroroo and other centres have reduced its area of influence.  Prior to this, patients were sent in from anywhere in the outlying districts as far as Broken Hill.

Over 30 years ago the Teetulpa gold rush resulted in a heavy influx of typhoid patients requiring tents to be erected in the grounds.  In the early days of Broken Hill many patients were sent to the Burra Hospital.  The original building has been much transformed, being practically rebuilt and refitted.  An operating theatre was built and an X-ray plant installed by the generosity of Mr I.J. Warnes, yet the maternity needs had not been addressed.  Particularly prior to 1920-21 the nurses were not qualified in obstetrics and expectant mothers were refused admission on occasion.  About four years ago the late J.E.H. Winnall raised the idea of a maternity wing and in May 1922 he was able to announce that the scheme had been made practicable through the generosity of Mrs W.P. Barker and Mr J. Melrose and if it attracted a Government subsidy (which it did) the scheme could go ahead.  A committee considered the matter and reported favourably.  Last Wednesday 3 June the completed wing was opened by Dr Morris, the Inspector-General of Hospitals.

The new structure is a handsome modern building drawing on the bungalow design, of blue stone with brick pillars and facings.  The Melrose family was represented by Mr J. Melrose, Mr & Mrs A.J. Melrose and Miss L. Melrose.  The Barker family’s representatives were Mrs W.P. Barker, her daughter and son, Mrs F.R. Wigley, Mrs A. Hooper (Adelaide), Miss Muriel Barker & Mr & Mrs John R. Barker.  Mr & Mrs John Tennant were also present.

Dr Steele as chairman of the building committee introduced Dr Morris.  He had approached Mr J. Melrose who promised £1,000 if the name of the late W.P. Barker could be associated with it.  He then communicated with Mrs W.P. Barker and in the end between them they had donated over £3,100.  They developed a plan which was turned down by Mr Melrose and a whole series of modified plans until they agreed on one.  That left the furnishing and one day Mr Melrose took him to Princess Royal and by the time they left Mr John Tennant had promised up to £740 to furnish and equip the wing.  The Government should rejoice as they had to subsidise it only to the extent of 10/- in the £.

Dr Morris apologised for the Chief Secretary who had to attend a levee at Government House for the King’s birthday.  He spoke at some length about infant mortality and the desirability of maternity hospitals.  He also thanked the generous donors and praised the architect Mr Simpson and contractor Mr Woollacott.  There were then speeches by W.G. Hawkes, John Melrose, the Mayor (Mr Collins), Mr W.J. Cousins (Chairman of the Booborowie DC), Rev. W.J. Mortimer (Organiser of Methodist hospital work in Adelaide), Hon. S. Ritchie, Hon. W.G. Mills & A.R.G. Hawkes MP.

Dr Steele then handed the key over to the chairman of the Hospital Board.

On entering the building from the verandah one enters an administrative hall 19ft x 12ft.  On either side are two wards; one 20ft x 19ft and the other 22ft x 19ft, each with four beds, lockers etc.  Then there is a corridor 46ft x 7ft with rubber covering on the floor to silence footfalls (at a cost of over £80).  Private and professional rooms open off this; on the right the obstetrics room is 15ft x 14ft and off that the sterilising room. On the left is the septic ward* fitted with cribs.  Each of four private rooms has its separate balcony.  Each room and each ward has a corner fireplace so built that they back onto linen presses to keep linen warm and well aired in winter.  At the end of the corridor is a pantry to one side and a sink room.  At the end are lavatories and bathrooms.
