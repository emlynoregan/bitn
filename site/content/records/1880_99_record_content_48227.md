Fire also broke out in Mr Frederick’s paddock at Redruth on Tuesday, but was extinguished.  J.R. Gray who brought home a bag used in fighting the fire failed to notice it was smouldering and placed it in his coach-house.  A few minutes later the building was in flames and considerable damage was done before it was extinguished.
