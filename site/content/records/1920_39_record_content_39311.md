Tennis.  The meeting to form a Burra Tennis Club on Thursday night was well attended.  The plan is to get land and lay down nine courts.  There are signatures of 43 intending members, but it was decided at least 100 are required to finance the scheme.  Three committees were appointed.  Subscriptions for the first year are £1-5-0 for seniors and £0-12-6 for juniors.
