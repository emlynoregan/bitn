A Review of the Year 1994

Burraâ€™s Main Street Program was outlined to a meeting of c. 40 people.  A survey was undertaken to obtain suggestions.  A grant of $20,000 was received from the State Government for the employment of a co-ordinator.  The Burra Burra DC released a draft street tree policy.

New Swimming Pool.  Progress continued on the replacement pool, with the official handover to the District Council from the contractor on 1 March.  The usual school swimming carnival had to be abandoned.

The Season. The first four months yielded only 19.8 mm with no rain at all in March or April.  Good rains in June enable seeding to be completed.  (119 mm in Burra)  August had a cold snap with snow at Mt Bryan, Hallett and Whyte Yarcowie, but more rain fell in early September.

Burra Jubilee 150 plans are well in hand for 1995.

Leonie Fretwell is co-ordinator.

A calendar to publicise the year has turned out very well.

Burra sticker sheets and a special Burra postmark have become reality.

Burra Community Print will publish souvenir issues of the old Burra Record.
