Editorial on the Burra Water Supply.

We have always maintained that a general water scheme was unnecessary as a majority of ratepayers neither wanted water nor were willing to pay for it and the widely scattered nature of housing made it too costly to deliver via pipes.  The scheme should only serve places where it is needed and where houses are reasonably close together.  We support a scheme whereby the Council takes over the waterworks and sells water not by rate, but by metered amounts at a certain price per 1,000 gallons.  The Council would have the balance of the revenue after working expenses and payment to the Govt (3% on capital in the 1st year, 4% in the 2nd year and 5% per annum thereafter.)  Should the Council secure the railways as a customer, even at a severe discount, it should enable a good profit if water were sold at 5/- per 1,000 gallons.  The plan is to construct a reservoir on the hill opposite Messrs Roach Bros Mill, high enough to give a good pressure of water to all customers and to lay pipes to Commercial St and the Hospital, and also to connect the existing Aberdeen system and to run eastwards to about Mr Bartholomæus’s store in Redruth.  From these mains services could be laid on as required.  Fireplugs would be placed along the mains and Aberdeen would be supplied from the reservoir, not the present raised tanks, receiving cooler and fresher water.  A question to be decided is where to pump from.  A new well might be sunk.  An old shaft might be deepened, or the present source used with new, more powerful lifts.  A new well has cost against it, and both of the other options leave the railways with their own supply, removing a valuable customer.  Thus the present shaft would be best if at a reasonable cost and if not then another of the Bon Accord shafts.  Or the present shaft could be leased.  This would be the best choice since it would be the most cost effective in the event of the mine starting again and so lowering the watertable, making a new well or old shaft useless.
