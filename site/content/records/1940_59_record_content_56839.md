Burra Burra DC

G.S. Hawker forwarded a report from the Minister of Mines concerning Burra.  This was negative for both uranium and copper.

A £500 special grant was received to make the road on the eastern side of the railway line at Mt Bryan.

Bowls.  The Burra Green v. Burra Gold match was abandoned due to rain.

Kooringa Methodist Ladies’ Guild met on Wednesday for the last time before breaking until March 1953.

St Mary’s.  Rev. R.S.T. Pettet, having been asked by the Bishop to consider taking over St Hugh’s Parish at Angaston, has visited that town and has decided to accept.  He expects to be instituted as Priest-in-charge of Angaston early in the New Year.  He began duties at Burra in March 1948.
