Shopping Area Musical Chairs

Following the recent reference to moving businesses Meredith Satchell submitted a report from the Burra Record of November 1899.  The lengthy report of the ‘musical chairs’ then being played out is reprinted.

Maureen Wright writes wondering if there is any hope that the railway line might be used again.  There was a suggestion that Perlite might use it.  If so, keeping the crossing on the bypass in a usable state might aid the cause.

D.R. Woolley continues to question local petrol prices.
