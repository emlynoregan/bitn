SA Parliament

Mr Rees proposed that the lands east of Burra be included within the operation of the Waste Lands Alienation Act of 1872.  [That is would be made available for selection for farming.]

Mr Rees said he had received a letter from a prominent citizen there who said that if polled the citizens of Burra would strongly support opening the lands to settlement.  It might be hard to take those lands from those presently making their living from them, were it not for the principle that land suited for agriculture must be thrown open for that purpose.  It was said the lands were beyond Goyder’s Line of Rainfall, but he was informed that directly after the line was drawn the heaviest rains for some years were experienced there.  ‘Goyder’s rainfall had been thought by the majority of persons to be a popular fiction.’  Mr Solomon interjected: ‘No.’

‘He thought in the language of a well-known agriculturalist, there was no part of South Australia that could not be applied to farming.  It was suggested that this action was being taken by a few miserable storekeepers in the Burra.  But they were men such as Mr Drew, Mr Dawson, Mr Lane and Mr Ridgway, and presuming the land were not fitted for agriculture the result would be disastrous to the storekeepers, who  would have to give credit.’

‘Mr Simms would emphatically state, from his own knowledge, that the land was unfit for agriculture and in that statement he was borne out by Mr Goyder’s report … Supposing persons complied with the Act, they would simply take the land next to the water for agriculture, and use the rest for pastoral purposes, and he did not think it right to turn one class out for the benefit of another.’

Mr Mann, the Attorney General said he would also have to oppose the motion, having discussed the matter with Mr Goyder.  The few suitable sections would not pay for the cost of survey.

Mr Townsend agreed there were but three or four blocks fit for agriculture.

The motion was negatived.

Further consideration of £750 for the Institute at Kooringa was called and not being proceeded with went off the paper.  [But see 11 December 1875, page 6.]
