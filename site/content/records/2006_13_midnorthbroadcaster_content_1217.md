Goyder Council & the National Trust Proposal re Heritage Passports

Council agreed to a 20-year lease of Council Passport sites to the National Trust, but was concerned about a reduction in Burra Visitor Centreâ€™s commission for selling the Passports.

Council favours a new committee to replace the current Passport & Visitors Information Centre Committee, comprising the Mayor (or his nominee), CEO, senior staff member, one Councillor, three members of the National Trust and three from BRTBA.

Council felt that while the sale of Passports beyond Burra would raise its profile, it could result in visitors then relying on the Visitor Centre for information when they arrived, without generating any income from the sales.

Council was concerned over the proposed carve-up of the passport income: 30% to maintenance of Council sites, 30% to maintenance of National Trust sites, 10% to marketing and promotion and 25% other.  Council proposed the Visitor Centre receives 20% commission on Passport sales, rather than the 10% proposed by the National Trust and 30% it currently gets.  Also the National Trust to provide the Council with an annual report covering maintenance, improvements, marketing and promotions.  Council also had some concerns over the National Trust request to be able to approve short-term sub-hire of sites.

Council agreed to insure its own sites, with NTSA to reimburse the cost to Council and agreed to maintain the gravel roads in the Mine site and to define Council site boundaries.
