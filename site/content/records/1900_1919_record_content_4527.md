Burra Literary Soc. debated the topic Should Capital Punishment be Abolished?  There was a good attendance.  There was a general discussion after three speakers on each side.  Messrs Hardy, Clarke and Drew spoke for the affirmative and Messrs Fairweather, Holden and Treloar spoke against.  The negative side was the better prepared and eventually won by 12 votes.  Mr C. Fuss was an efficient chairman.
