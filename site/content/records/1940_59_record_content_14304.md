Burra Town Council, 19 July

The Minister of defence advises that Mr Fowler’s recent inspection of premises had nothing to do with the Council’s recent enquiry.

Col. Shaw now advises that normal street lighting can be resumed if provisions for a complete blackout were made if such became necessary.

Goldsbrough, Mort say the trees in the creek were damaged before their sheep were placed there and stray stock had been in the reserve.

Mr Howell writes that he is not the owner of the old mill, but that it now belongs to Mr A.D. Sellars.

Messrs Simpson & Son say the plaque for HMAS Burra-Bra will be ready in 21 days.

Burra Electric Supply Co. suggests Council supply two men and a truck to assist one of their technicians in removing masks from streetlights.

A sign indicating ‘To Burra’ will be placed at the Bon Accord Corner at the request of the District Council.

A bill for £10-10-0 will be sent to the person [Bob Selth] who damaged the wall at the Burra North Bridge.

Mr Frahm offers to repair the Victoria Park wall for 2/9 an hour.  He will supply scaffolding and the Council the material.

Various repairs to paths and roads were approved.

Cr Bevan sought permission for a military team to play football for patriotic funds on Victoria Park on a Sunday afternoon.  He said the team could not get away on a Saturday.

The Mayor said they had had quite a lot of trouble over that kind of thing before.

Cr Bevan thought things had changed and that quite a lot of things were now done on Sundays.

The Mayor said they were ruled by a set of by-laws.

Cr Kellaway was much opposed to any desecration of the Sabbath.  The team had played at Hallett on a Saturday and could do so here.

The Mayor said no one had the right to charge admission to Victoria Park or any of the parklands without Council permission and this had already been done once or twice and if it occurred again he would take action.

Cr Fisher had no objections to the request.  Soldiers did not stop fighting on Sundays.

The Mayor said a lot of petrol would be used and that was not patriotic.

Cr Lee would not support the match personally, but thought people should be allowed to choose for themselves.

Cr Harvey thought it was all right, but that more money would be made on a Saturday because it could be followed by a dance.  The question of petrol did not come into it: the Government was allowing 40,000 gallons extra for electioneering purposes.

[The outcome remains unclear, as the paper article ends with ‘This closed the discussion.]
