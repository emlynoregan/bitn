Burra Rock ’n’ Roll Weekend has been cancelled for 2009 due to poor ticket sales.  Event organiser Sue Ryan said a major part of the problem was string competition on that weekend from other events.  The Day on the Green in Clare will feature Jimmy Barnes and is expecting a crowd of 6,000.  Other events are the Marrabel Bull Ride and the Adelaide Plains Cup.  The Burra hotel has traditionally hosted a rock ’n’ roll dance on the Friday before the main event on Saturday.  Publican Bill Overell says they still intend to have a live band that night and they hope locals will support the event.  The hotel has for some time had a live band every Friday, but rising costs for bands and lack of patronage have seen this now cut to a fortnightly show and if things don’t improve the whole issue of live music will have to be reconsidered.  Organisers will consider rescheduling the event later in the year.
