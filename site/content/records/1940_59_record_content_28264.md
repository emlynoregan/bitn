The Prime Minister Rt Hon. J.B. Chifley will visit Burra on Monday night next.  The last occasion of a visit by a Prime Minister was the Hon. M.W. Hughes in the early 1920s*.  The Mayor Mr H.J.B. Jennison intends to entertain the PM at a dinner at the Burra Hotel, after which there will be a Civic Reception at the Council chambers at 7.30 p.m.

[*This is incorrect; Prime Minister S.M. Bruce visited on 26 March 1925.  W.M. Hughes had been welcomed at the Railway Station as he passed through on 28 August 1922 and he also unveiled the War Memorial 29 March 1922.]
