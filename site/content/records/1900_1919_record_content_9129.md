Further details of the assault on J.D. Kelly, the well-known athlete.

The victim was assaulted by O. May, son of Matthew May, and by E. Truscott, brother of Walter T. Truscott.  Kelly was first attacked by Truscott and May followed up using a bottle on Kelly’s head.  An old man intervened, but was ‘laid out’.  Mrs Caseretto then appeared, but was threatened if she did not leave.  Mr Caseretto tried to break it up, but could not do so till he drew his revolver which undoubtedly saved Kelly’s life.  The police and Dr Sangster were sent for.  The victim was badly cut and bruised and had a face so badly swollen as to be unrecognisable.  The two assailants took Kelly’s hat and coat and purse with £6.  The coat was eventually recovered from the yard of the Mine Stores.  May and Truscott tried to borrow money to make up the amount to square matters with Kelly.  They were arrested in the afternoon of the 25 December and charged with assault and robbery and the case will be dealt with today.  Truscott has only been here a few weeks, but May is known locally personally and by repute.
