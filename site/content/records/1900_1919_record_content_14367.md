Mr T.H. Williams, Inspector of Stock, was interviewed re his appointment and the sick horses in the district.  He had seen those of Mr Woollacott and concluded they were suffering from a severe cold due to being hard worked by day and not being given shelter at night.  Horses etc. needed to be sheltered or rugged in such extremely cold weather.  T.H. Williams was previously in Burra about 15 years ago when he was a policeman here.
