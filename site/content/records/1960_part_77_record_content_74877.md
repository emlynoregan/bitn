Burra Primary School Welfare Club last year held nine meetings and the average attendance was 9 from 42 members representing 220 children.  This year we began a reading scheme for children with few problems, to encourage them and 15 mothers volunteered.  The group held interesting meetings with teachers and visited Balaklavaâ€™s flexible unit system of education.  The canteen has realised a profit of $869.  Elected for 1975 were: President, Mrs R. Thamm; 1st Vice-President, Mrs C. Phillips; 2nd Vice-President, Mrs D. Lloyd; Secretary, Mrs M. Tiver; Assistant Secretary, Mrs J. Secombe; Treasurer, Mrs G. Nourse.
