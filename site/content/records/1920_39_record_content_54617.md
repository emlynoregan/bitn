Baldina Mongolata GM Syndicate: tributer’s report for block 1 for fortnight to 26 January.

Sunk 16ft then drove 6ft south and 8ft north in values of c. 2oz per ton in a seam of oxidised iron and quartz with gold evenly distributed.  Expect 10 tons to crush in a week or two.

Gold still underfoot in the shaft, but presently driving south on the seam where good specimens were found before the holidays.
