Kindergarten Day in Burra, 13 November

Last Friday the Hon. Sir Bruce Ross LLB officially opened the newly registered Kindergarten in the morning and in the afternoon the Christmas Tree Carnival in the Town Hall.  The functions were well attended and the District Ladies’ Organisations raised £190.  The official party at the Kindergarten comprised: Sir Bruce Ross & Lady Ross; Mrs R.B. Pitcher, President of the Burra Branch; Miss Mellor, Superintendent of Kindergartens; The Mayor & Mayoress, Mr & Mrs E.T. Baulderstone; Mr Rex Warnes & Mrs Warnes; Mr L.A. Beinke President of the Burra Air Force Association and Mr G.R. Finch, Chairman of Burra Burra DC.  [The punctuation makes it unclear whether Rex Warnes or L.A. Beinke was President of the AFA, but I am not aware Rex Warnes was in the RAAF.]

Mrs Pitcher welcomed the guests.  She thanked Mrs J. Carpenter for her great effort in getting the Kindergarten started and the Air Force Association for granting a 20 year lease at £1 p.a.  Sir Bruce Ross said Mrs Carpenter had started the effort with a small band of children in the Methodist Church Hall and as interest grew it was decided to join the Kindergarten Union, which was done on 1 April 1964.  The Kindergarten began with half day periods, but now two afternoons have been added and no less than 43 young children attend.  He unveiled a plaque and opened the door.  Sir Bruce said the first Kindergarten had been founded in SA in 1906 and by 1945 there were still only 10, but now there were 119.  Sir Bruce Ross also opened the Christmas Tree Carnival in the Town Hall.  The best exhibit was the entry of the ‘Eastern Dorcas Society’.  [Photo in 87, 47 (3) 24 Nov. 1964.]  Takings for the day amounted to £190.  [Kindergarten or Christmas Tree: or are they the same thing as far as the money goes?
