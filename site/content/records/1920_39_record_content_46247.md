Burra Town Council, 6 June

Refund of £8-7-8 received from the Fire Brigade Board for 1932.

The Mayor objected to comments of W.G. Hawkes in the Record’s report of the Wool Exhibition that Burra had not its old spick and span appearance and had gone back in the matter of paint.  The Mayor believed it was one of the best kept towns in SA.

Cr Bevan questioned whether Mr Hawkes was referring to Council property or business places.  He agreed in some instances the depression had caused a slipping back.

Crs were appointed to inspect a problem caused by drainage of water from the railway property.

Aberdeen gardens are to be put in order and Mr Opperman is to be employed on them.

It was agreed that future tree plantings will be in accordance with the recommendations in Mr Tom Wilkinson’s report.
