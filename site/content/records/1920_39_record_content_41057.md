Burra Amateur Swimming Club.  The working bee has been cutting paths, making the safety enclosure and erecting dressing enclosures etc.  The shallow end of the pool has been graded and cut off from the rest with a cyclone fence.  A grand carnival will mark the opening next Saturday and a program of aquatic sports has been arranged.
