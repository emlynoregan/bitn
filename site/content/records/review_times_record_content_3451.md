The Bon Accord mine shaft is covered with glass so visitors can look into the shaft.

There is a display of shovels, picks and other mining artefacts recovered from the mine during open cut operations in the 1970s.  There is also a display of the social history of the town and a model of the Burra Burra Mine made by Pam Marlow.  Burra was significant Mr Wright said, because it and Kapunda were the first two mines in Australia to pay dividends to owners.  Mining had begun here in 1845.
