‘Port Augusta Gossip’ writes on the chaos caused by the new rule that forbids people to enter or leave Salvation Army services except during singing.  The rule is causing more disturbance than the movement of people did.  People have a right to leave a public building when they like.  It is said the gaps between singing are short, but some of the rambling testimonies belie that.

R. Smith writes about larrikinism in Redruth.  Young men are disturbing Salvation Army meetings there at the Redruth Barracks.  Why, he asks, is there no police action when it is ‘right opposite the police station’?

[It is not clear from this exactly what site is meant, but allowing for a little latitude in the description they were perhaps using the old German Church.]

W.R. Ridgway takes up the editor’s suggestion last issue that it would have been better if he had withdrawn from the election and so helped Dr Stephens’s chances of being elected instead of Mr Rounsevell.  He disputes that this was a good option.

‘I suppose in your editorial wisdom you thought it better to hands of[f] Rounsevell and push Ridgway.’

[A somewhat ironic conclusion considering what Rounsevell had to say of his treatment by the same editor.]
