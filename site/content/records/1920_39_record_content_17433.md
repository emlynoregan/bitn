Redruth Court, 29 October

In the aftermath of the Burra Show nine men were charged with drunkenness and each was fined 10/-. 

In addition one of them was fined £3 + 10/- costs for resisting police and another was fined 10/- + 10/- costs for disturbing the peace.

George Hann JP, who for 10½ years has been managing clerk for Bright & Bright, solicitors of Kooringa, has severed his connections with them and intends to go into partnership with Harrold Button.  They are seeking offices in Kooringa and will represent Dalgety & Co., The South British Insurance Co. and other important firms.

Miss A. Deegan of the local telephone staff for 12 months was farewelled at the Parish Hall on 2 November upon her removal to the Adelaide office.  She received a xylonite toilet set.
