Burra Literary Soc. held their annual social at the Kooringa Methodist Hall.  It was an evening of toasts, music, elocution and a dramatic scene.  Refreshments began at 8 p.m.  After the National Anthem and Loyal Toast there was a performance of the trial scene from The Merchant of Venice.  There were 52 members of the society and they were soon to lose two good members in Rev. W.G. Clarke & Mrs Clarke who are likely to move before the next session.  Mr Clarke has been President since the society started three years ago.
