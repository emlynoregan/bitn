The Leader of the Opposition will be requested to ask a question in the House concerning the intention of the SA Housing Trust regarding construction of homes in Burra, as land had been purchased for that purpose.  Also, why no tender was accepted and how the tenders submitted compared with those for houses being built in other country towns.
