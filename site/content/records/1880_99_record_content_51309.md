The Committee of the Five Ex-Mayors

The committee met on Thursday 21 September and examined the Council minutes and the reports in the Record from January 1893 to the present.  After 3½ hours the committee adjourned and resumed on Friday night, finally finishing on Saturday afternoon.  They sent copies of their report to the Mayor and the Editor of the Record.  Their findings were as follows:

Reports in the earlier part of the year were substantially correct, though needlessly detailed.

That of 17 July, published on 19 July, which seems to have sparked the recent problem ‘did not contain anything which need have been seriously noticed by the Council’.

The Town Council on 7 August passed a resolution severely condemning the reporter of the Record for the report of the meeting of 17 July which they considered ‘undeserving’ of serious criticism.

From then on the tone of reports in the Record changed and ‘has been decidedly offensive, caricaturing certain members of Council and holding them up to ridicule’. 

‘This mode of reporting cannot be justified.’

‘The headings of some of the reports have also been objectionable.’

‘We cannot express surprise that the councillors who felt aggrieved by these reports sought by some means to prevent their continuance.’

The committee agreed that the Council had a right to sit with closed doors, but felt that it was undesirable for that to be usually adopted.

It also held it desirable for reports of Council business to be published.

In future Council business should be reported simply with any comment reserved for other columns.

Such details of conversations in Council that have sometimes been given could with advantage be omitted as tending to excite ill feeling and promote differences.

While recent press reports have been objectionable a continuation of Council action by recent methods would be disastrous.
