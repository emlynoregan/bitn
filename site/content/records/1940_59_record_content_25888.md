A Wool Mill

The Mayor has received advice that the Australian Wool Development Co. intends to set up woollen mills costing £500,000 each in thirty centres across Australia.  Four will be in SA.  The company is seeking information about the suitability of towns for the location of a mill.  Requirements are:

Availability of untrained labour – about 1,500.

Availability of a 250 to 500 acre site.

Adequate water, electricity and coal supply.

Wool supply.

Local rates and taxes and any concessions that may be offered to such a mill.

The company is in the process of being formed with a capital of £20 million.

Let’s leave no stone unturned in getting a mill established here.
