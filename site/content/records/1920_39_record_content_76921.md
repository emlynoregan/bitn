LCL held a combined Men’s & Women’s Branches meeting on 3 November that was addressed by A.D. McDonald MP.  The speech is reported in ¾ column and is concerned with wheat production, prices, the Wheat Board and the Wheat Stabilisation Scheme.

Burra Burra Show Inc. reports that the committee did not raise the price of rent due from side-show operators.  For ten years it has been 1/- per foot with a minimum charge of 2/6.  The proprietors formed themselves into a guild and were prepared to pay 6d a foot only.  They have tried it at other shows whose committees have capitulated.
