Lipsett & the Church. W. Pearce, Philip Lane & James Phillips write in reply to R.W. Campbell's letter denying that E. Lipsett (now in the north) resigned his membership upon the charge being proved. They say the charge was withdrawn. They also object to the publishing of details of church meetings which are matters for the church alone. The editor comments: - Neither side can say the charge was proved or not: as no vote was taken both views are merely opinions. The other point is the CONDITION of withdrawal.

The charge had in good faith been withdrawn on a promise of unconditional resignation which was accepted.

John D. Cave responds to the slurs cast upon him by Mr Lane at the dinner given to Mr Lipsett, and does so by submitting for publication three letters to him vouching for his good name at the places referred to by Mr Lane.

‘Observer’ writes that he considers the whole debate re the former mayor reflects badly on the participants, but especially on those who profess to be strong Christians or are ministers of religion.
