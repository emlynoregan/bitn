Dr Brummitt’s holiday notes Part XVII: The Woman’s Exhibition at Earl’s Court.

Weather.  Last Sunday [1 December]  a heavy thunderstorm struck Burra with a great deluge of rain and much damage was dome in some parts of town.  The bridge over the creek opposite the Kooringa Post Office was washed away as was the one between Mitchell’s Flat and Lower Thames St.  [The Pig and Whistle crossing]  Some houses were flooded.  The top metal was removed from some roads.  The Burra Creek ran a banker though the heavy rain lasted only 1½ hours and was followed by light showers.  In F. Harris’s shop the water caused bags of lime to ignite.  Fortunately the fire was quickly extinguished.  Water rushed into Mr Hiddle’s house Messrs Urwin & Sons had water all through the shop and damage to silks and satins from an overflowing parapet gutter.  Damage was estimated at £10.  The fall was 2.41”.

The flood almost covered the bridge near Reed’s at the north end of town.

Mr Allen and family were flooded out of their home [The Bushman’s Rest] and sought refuge at the Court House hotel.  Mr Gully and family also fled.  The footbridge near J.R. Gray’s was carried under a larger one and placed against a third near the Court House.

Market Square was generally under water.  Water got into Drew & Crewe’s cellar, but the sugar had been raised on stands.

T.P. Halls went to Baldina in his cab and had to wait over three hours for the water level at Baldina Ford to drop and then only got through with a drenching.

Messrs Gray’s and Bentley’s houses were swamped.

Damage to crops was considerable and William Finch, south of Kooringa saw the total destruction of his crop.  [The next issue corrects this, saying his crop was saved.]

At Hampton two dams had their banks removed and deposited in the Reformatory Paddock.

On Monday the weather was boisterous with damage to fruit trees.

Burra Town Council, 30 November.

The Railways Dept. has agreed to add 50’ to the length of the crane platform.

Commercial St Bridge to be repaired.

St Mary’s Strawberry Fete was held last Friday and raised £100 compared with £84 last year.

John Tennant advises that trespassers on Princess Royal Estate will be prosecuted.

Boer War.  Last Saturday the city of Adelaide was blazing with bunting and mad with rejoicing as troops returned from Africa.  There was a great crowd that waited long and with good humour.  At the Exhibition Building the audience was most enthusiastic with every patriotic remark bringing cheers.  The troops then marched to the Parade Ground to be dismissed.  Rejoicing went on far into the night.
