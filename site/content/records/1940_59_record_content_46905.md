The Marrabel-Burra Road was supposed to be bituminised under a five-year plan.  Nothing has eventuated.  Now the Town and District Councils have been requested by a recent meeting of ratepayers to ask for some indication of when work will start.  The volume of traffic, on this main road from Adelaide to Broken Hill, is causing it to deteriorate beyond what a local authority can manage.
