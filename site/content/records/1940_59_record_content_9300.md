Black-Out Trial

[Details are given or repeated along with instructions for cars.  The restrictions for the latter were quite severe – a 1 inch strip of lights from the headlights – rather harsh given that street lights beyond the 10 mile zone (presumably from the city and/or the coast) had only to be reduced by 50%.  Other air raid precautions are listed.]
