Cr Harris: ‘After hearing Cr Linkson’s statement I don’t think he is to blame.’

Cr West: ‘I would sooner take his word than Cr Hardy’s any day.’

Hardy then claimed the work was done without his knowledge.

He believed that Andrews was entitled to the day work and Cr Parks 2nd Hardy’s interpretation and a move to send Andrews the job the next morning.

Cr Linkson said he would not have voted for Andrews re-appointment had he understood he was to get all the day work.

Cr Walsh [Corrected in the paper of 7 June to Cr West] said that Mrs Vivian of Opie’s Hotel was speaking to me relative to erecting a verandah in front of the hotel.  I will propose that the Council inspect the place and decide what they will do.

Cr Hardy: She will have to pay one-half cost of the kerbing.  I have only just found this out, so that is how Rabbich & Sons ‘got out’ of paying their share for the kerbing done near their place.

A voice – Oh what foolishness.

Cr Harris 2nd.  Carried.

There was then further squabbling over matters associated with the Waterworks and minor works in East Ward, but not of great consequence.
