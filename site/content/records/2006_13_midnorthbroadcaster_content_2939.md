Burra Regional Art Gallery have plans to see a regional palaeontology centre developed in the Burra Railway Station.  Before this can happen though, the station needs to be restored and converted.  The Railway Station Group is headed by Roger Cross and Peter Harvey and is seeking funds for a Building Survey and Works Project Report.  This would enable them to apply for grants.  The SA Museum is keen to participate in this project, which would see the site as an educational venue for schools and adult groups and would provide palaeontologists from the SA Museum and Flinders University a base and research area to continue their work at Redbanks.  The initial survey is estimated to cost $3,500.
