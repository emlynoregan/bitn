Frank Treloar: Looking Back (Continued)

Freight was arranged in shipping.

The directors first thought of calling their township Redruth, but then decided on Kooringa.

1,000 bags were ordered at 8d each – marked SAMA.

Samuel Stocks was appointed Resident Director at the mine.  Mr Solomon resigned as a director.

Henry M. Boswarva was appointed clerk at Burra Mine at £80 per annum from 1 February 1846.

13 January 1846 the first shipments of ore had been made to shipping agents in England and the Association had discounted bills with the Bank of Australasia for £4,587-14-8 – the mine’s first returns.

Messrs Penny & Graham visited the mine and reported plenty of ore was available to load drays as they arrived.  They advised the appointment of a medical man at the mine.  Mr Humble was appointed storekeeper at 30/- a week in place of G. Edwards who resigned.

Rates of cartage were reduced from £3 to £2-15-0.  Charles Beck replaced Samuel Stocks Jnr as Chairman.  Directors decided to build cottages for their officers and a smelting furnace and they arranged with Mr Kingston to engage masons and to see the work carried out.

The first cottages were built in Thames St; distinguished by their massive chimneys.

Land was being surveyed northward and perhaps with a view of stopping places on the road to Burra SAMA bought all three places for a trifle over the upset price of £1 an acre when they were offered for sale at the land office:

Section 2002 Kings Station of 80 acres which was later let to William Templar at £10 p.a. on condition he build a hotel within 12 months.  Templers [sic] built a good country hotel.

Section 2402 Taylor’s Station of 77 acres about 3 miles east of Stockport was at a crossing over the River Light where later a bridge was built and a hotel.

Section 3200 Emu Springs of 80 acres.  This was near Black Springs.  It was first leased to Dan. Cudmore and he later transferred it to a Mr Tapley.  A hotel was built there which later accidentally burnt down.

26 February 1846.  Mr Kingston reported the officer’s cottages were coming on satisfactorily.

17 March 1846.  Directors appointed Dr Thomson as mine surgeon at 6d per week for all employed over the age of 18.  Mr Kingston presented a plan of the proposed Township of Kooringa, which was approved.

20 October 1846.  The first balance sheet and report to directors.  Mr Humbles salary as storekeeper was increased to £100 p.a.

8 October 1846.  Mr Stocks attended a meeting of directors and explained his role as Resident Director.  He asked to resign and recommended appointing a mining Captain instead.

5 January 1847.  The directors appointed Captain Roach as Mining Captain at £225 p.a. with two months notice on either side.  This turned out to be a wise appointment.  He remained until the Darlington Scheme came along.

[Details of the first statement of accounts for the period 16 April 1845 to 31 March 1846 are printed.]

By the end of March 1846 they had property and improvements valued at £11,845-7-10 with cash of £22-9-2.

First Annual Report 16 April 1846

The directors reported that progress had exceeded their best expectations.

Copper raised since the first day of mining 29 September 1845 to 28 March 1846:

Ore for exportation 1,983 tons 17cwt 1qr 3lb

Ore reserved for smelting 723 tons

Total 2,706 tons 17cwt 1qr 3lb
