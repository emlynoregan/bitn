‘Colonist’ writes to the editor to say that the merging of the positions of telegraph master and postmaster deserves consideration.  Also it would benefit country settlers if, as a service to the community, the daily shipping news and other public announcements could be transmitted each morning to each telegraph station.

The writer also urges the utmost care in the selection and training of telegraph officers, who must be made to understand that secrecy is indispensable to their tenure of office.
