Editorial on The Burra Town Council.

The general rate at 1/- could hardly have been reduced given the lower assessment.

The health rate at 3d [amended from 3½d at a meeting on 6 Jan.] evoked a similar response.  We are unfortunately saddled with a 3d Park Lands rate because there are bonds to be paid off in reference to the oval wall which cost over £500 a few years ago.  We hope yet for better times for the oval, when it will be used well and cease to attract cries of ‘white elephant’.  The water rate is the sorest point as it applies to those who do not require the water at all and yet who are compelled to pay.  As far as the main roads are concerned, since the abolition of road boards the Corporation has received we believe £600 for main roads and a good deal of work has been done for the money.

The Record will be published on Wednesday for the purpose of catching the Friday markets.

Fire.  On Thursday evening last a kerosene lamp in the Salvation Army barracks burst while the doors were locked and the Army at an open-air meeting.  Fortunately a couple of young fellows burst the door and put the fire out or considerable damage would have been done.  Captain Bridges was quite shaken by the fright occasioned.

The Brewery Watercourse.  We are glad that one of the property owners with obstructions along the watercourse that has been the centre of so much dispute has decided to put a man on to remove the obstruction: viz.  Messrs Catchlove & Co.  We believe Messrs Bagot, Shakes & Lewis should take the same upright stand and save the ratepayers further expense.

The Bible Christian quarterly meeting showed a deficiency of c. £4 and the revision of the membership rolls showed a great many persons had left for Broken Hill and other places.  Since the last examination was made Mr E.J. Piper, son of Rev. T. Pipier, President of the Conference has been recommended as a candidate for the ministry.  He has been supplying the circuit since the failure of Rev. J. Stoyel’s health.

Mr Freebairn, a farmer of Alma Plains, seems to have been robbed of £80 at the Bon Accord Hotel whilst drunk.  A man named Roberts has been arrested.

Burra Institute monthly committee meeting received a report on the progress of the building of the new additions.
