J.F. Hogan responds to ‘A Boob. Player’.  Basically Hogan alleges that the Booborowie team has engineered an unfair advantage for itself by (a) combining the resources of North & South Booborowie – previously separate teams and (b) playing men from Spalding.  He suggests that one consequence is a fall in spectator numbers from 2-300 to 50.
