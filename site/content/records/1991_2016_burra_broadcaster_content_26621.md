Burra SES has been given approval to move their base to the old ETSA premises on Smelts Road.  Since the mid-1980s they have been housed in the old railways goods shed, but they were eager to move because of severe termite infestation of that structure.  The building houses two vehicles, a trailer and an office built within the shed.  The Council leases the building from Great Southern Railways and sublets it to the SES.  The SES contacted the Council some weeks ago, but the Council building inspector said he couldn’t do anything officially and the Council’s line was to contact the SES hierarchy or great Southern Railways.  SES members were frustrated over what they saw as a serious safety issue.  Because of termite damage:

The floor of the truck bay is sinking

The main door is in danger of falling in

The office, which is only 15 years old is extensively damaged

The wall facing the by-pass road has bowed out due to movement of the foundation and termite damage to the main wall posts

The western wall is in a similar state

The depot has no running water and therefore no showers

The toilet facilities are 100 m away.

The old ETSA building is owned now by the Metropolitan Fire service and SES and MFS members have been preparing it in anticipation of the move.
