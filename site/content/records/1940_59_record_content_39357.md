The St Mary’s Debutante Ball was held on Friday night last week.  The hall was gaily decorated under the supervision of Mrs A. Bence.  The stage was festooned with colourful floral decorations and the supper tables were also lavishly decorated with flowers.  The seven debutantes were presented to Mr G. Stanley Hawker MP and Mrs Hawker.  They were:

Miss Avis Clark with Mr Ron Pascoe

Miss Betty Spackman with Mr William Corner

Miss Dawn Bernhardt with Mr Norman Marston

Miss Betty Thomas with Mr Robert Seaford

Miss Thelma Seaford with Mr Norman Wilson

Miss Barbara Wall with Mr Don Allen

Miss Fay Clarke with Mr Gilbert Wilson.

The crowd was one of the biggest seen in Burra since the Centenary Celebrations.  The door takings were £75 and Darrel Field’s Orchestra provided the music.
