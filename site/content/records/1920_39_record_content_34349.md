Burra Town Council, 19 May

The Local Government Department wrote saying payment by rations had been discontinued.  The Government was prepared to pay in cash for work done by otherwise unemployed married men only in destitute circumstances.  Jobs were to be such as would not interfere with normal routine work and had to be approved in advance.

R.W. Bruceâ€™s request for kerbing at Paradise was not entertained.

Cr Pearce moved a notice be placed in the Burra Record advising that consideration would be given those who desired to work out their rates. (Raising road metal.)

Cr Woollacott gave notice of a motion that the Government be asked to approve Council raising a loan to be expended in unemployment relief.
