Re Kingston Street Bridge

The heritage value of this bridge means retention of its present style, construction and condition is vital.  Any damage caused to the bridge would have to be repaired to the original state and the cost would be astronomical.  Should the bridge be damaged the person who caused the damage would be held responsible for repair costs.  Should the disregard for the load limit displayed continue, it might be necessary to close the bridge to all traffic or at least restrict it to one lane for Light Vehicles Only.
