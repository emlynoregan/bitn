Legislative Council

The death of the Hon. C.C. Dudley Octoman has caused a by-election for the Northern District next Saturday 29 October.  [In the advertising article for the Liberal Party a neat constitutional history is given of the Legislative Council over the preceding century or so.]

1836-42	The control of the colony was largely in the hands of the Governor with the Board of Colonization Commissioners in control of emigration and revenues from the sale of land.

1842	SA became a Crown Colony with the Governor controlling the administration, aided by a seven-man nominated Council.

1851	The Council was changed to 16 elected members and 8 nominated members.

1857	Responsible Government was granted with a bicameral system using the secret ballot for the first time.  From 1857 to 1882 the Legislative Council comprised 18 members elected on a property qualification and returned by the whole province.

1882-1902	The 24 members were returned from 4 districts.

1902	The Legislative Council was reduced to 18 members.

1915-1966	The Legislative Council comprised 20 members.  The state was divided into three Country and two Metropolitan Districts, each returning four members.  (Northern, Midland, Southern Districts in the Country and Central No. 1 and Central No. 2 for the city.)

The Northern District is vast, stretching from Renmark to Port Lincoln and to the Northern Territory border and from the western to the eastern borders.  It covers nine House of Assembly electorates.

The four members are elected for six year terms, with half retiring usually every three years.

Membership is restricted to:

British subject for at least 30 years and resident in SA for 3 years.

Voters must be either owners of a freehold estate of clear value $100, leaseholders of an estate of clear annual value of $40 on a lease for at least three years or with right of purchase.

Or be a registered proprietor of a Crown Lease on which improvements value at least $100.

Or be an inhabitant occupying a dwelling house.  (i.e. anyone paying rent.)

Or be a returned serviceman or woman.

Be aged at least 21 years (unless entitled under the serviceman or woman provision.)

Voting is not compulsory.

Had Mr Playford been returned at the last election the vote would have been extended to spouses of those entitled to vote.

[The article is inserted by the Liberal Party and authorised by P.H .Quirke MP and ends by urging a vote for Arthur Whyte, the Liberal Candidate.]
