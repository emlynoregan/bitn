Robert Kewley of Hamilton was summonsed to show cause why he should not contribute to the support of his mother Eliza Kewley of Kooringa.  Mrs Kewley 68 said she had received £7 in 12 years and it was three or four years since any payment.  He was unmarried and she was destitute.  A younger son, George, had kept her for the past 12 years, but he was now out of work in Broken Hill.  She wanted 5/- a week.  (Another son had not been heard of for 17 years.)  Robert Kewley said his work was not constant and he got 10/- to 12/- a week on farms.  The Bench ordered a payment of 3/- a week and the defendant seemed satisfied, paying six weeks’ allowance into the court.
