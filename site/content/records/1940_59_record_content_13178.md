Mongolata Goldfield

Baldina Mongolata GM Syndicate for fortnight to 20 March.

Farnden’s Hill.  Stoping continued 6ft to 67ft with values c. 15dwt per ton.

Foxes are plentiful at Mt Bryan East.

Tubeless Tyres.  There is an article by on these, saying they were available from A.D. Sellars, proprietor of Jennison’s Tyre Service.

The Men of the 9th Division who have been home on leave for three weeks thank Burra for their good time while here.  They have not been mentioned before in an identifiable way due to censorship, lest the Japanese found out.

‘Ex Hobo’ writes condemning the punishment inflicted on Ernest Alfred Hunt whose great offence was really only to light a fire in a culvert to boil his billy.  The writer says of the person who reported Hunt: ‘How virtuous he must have felt as he hopped round to the police and did his Judas stunt.’

‘Ye Gods’ [sic] if all the people who have no visible means of support were thrown in the jug there would be no room for an honest to god criminal.
