G.L. Kemp took grand champion ram for all sections and the standard of sheep entries was very high.  Fleeces were also of great quality.

Messrs Aberg & Sons had a splendid display of meats, hams and smallgoods.

Pigs were good for slaughter, but hardly fat enough by country standards.

Cattle entries were good as were grain and fodder entries.

Poultry and pigeons were to the fore and improved on 1937.

Dogs were not numerous and were only a fair lot.

The prize list is printed.
