A New Patriotic Society is mooted to look after the interests of returning soldiers.  The Government will provide the men with good jobs and they will receive many advantages, social and otherwise through the RSL.  On the other hand there will be other unmet needs â€“ in the sphere of sports for instance and some will doubtless blow all their deferred pay on a good time and will need some back-up when they then decide to settle down.  Let us know if it is the wish of Burra residents to meet and discuss this matter.
