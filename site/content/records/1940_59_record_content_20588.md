High School House and Railway Cottages

A deputation from the Town Council recently waited on the Premier (Hon. T. Playford) with a view to getting a house for the High School headmaster and some cottages at Burra North for railway employees.  They pointed out that the Department already owned an allotment in the ‘Toorak’ area of the town and finding accommodation for newly arriving headmasters was often difficult.  Railway employees were often finding accommodation 1½ miles from the station because none was available at Burra North when needed.  The Premier undertook to take the matter up with the Ministers of Education and Public Works.
