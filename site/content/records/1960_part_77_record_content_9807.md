Council Amalgamation was discussed at a meeting between the Burra Town and District Councils on 31 January following a petition from 300 ratepayers.  It was resolved that the Councils separately discuss the issues and there be another joint meeting 21 February.  Mr Baulderstone said the issue arose from a petition of ratepayers, but he personally felt from 15 successive yearsâ€™ experience that the Town Council was too small.  The Council had reached its limit in rate revenue and the population had declined.  Rate revenue is three times that of thirty years ago, but administration [costs] are five time that of thirty years ago.  Money on administration could be saved by amalgamation.  He could not see why the two Councils could not work together.  The District Council than asked a series of questions:

What is the rate revenue?

What percentage of the ratepayers is represented by the 300 petitioners?

How many miles of road are there in the Town Council area?

How is the income spent?

Does the Council work on Ward Accounts?

Is money raised in a ward spent in the ward?

What is the percentage of administrative costs against rate revenue?

Town Council members felt they needed to discuss matters further in their own chamber.

DC Chairman A.D. Radford felt amalgamation would be a step in the right direction, though the opinion of Councillors in both Councils was divided. If amalgamation was desired there would be many problems to overcome and a series of meetings would be needed.
