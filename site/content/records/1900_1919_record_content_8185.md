Helene Niemann complains in a letter to the editor that having converted from Anglicanism to Methodism after hearing Dr Torr’s address recently, she was accosted in the street by Rev. W.G.M. Murphy and told she was excommunicated and he made other unpleasant remarks.

M. Thomas writes also saying that Rev. Murphy publicly attacked Miss Niemann.

‘Commonsense’ also writes re Rev. Murphy’s display of bad temper.

[Note that Rev. Murphy replies in the next issue.]
