Burra Amateur Athletic Club held its third meeting on Monday at Copperhouse in Coles & Goodchild's paddock. The weather was wet and cold in the morning, improving a little by noon and during the afternoon some 300 people gathered. The start of the games was delayed from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. by the weather. The Moonta Band played and cabs ran to and fro. The sport went smoothly except when the crowd startled a trooper's during the running of the hurdles and it turned into the path of the runners, knocking over Brady and Freeman, two of the leading three men. The judges upheld a protest from Brady, but Camp and Freeman, the other two leaders, declined to run, [again] handing Brady an easy win. The events are reported and the prizes and results listed. Eight horsemen entered the tilting.
