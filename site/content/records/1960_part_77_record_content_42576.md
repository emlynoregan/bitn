The 50th Anniversary of Armistice Day was commemorated yesterday at a short ceremony at the Burra War Memorial.  Eight returned representatives of the armed services attended with civic leaders.  Eighty primary school children swelled the numbers.  Flags flew at half mast and shops were closed for the duration of the service.  Rev. J.H. Stephenson gave the address.  Messrs Nankivell, Young, Baulderstone and Finch laid wreaths.
