‘Spring Showman’ writes:

The Burra Show suffered from facilities that were crude and in bad repair after the lapse of time during the war, in which no shows were held.  The weather was also hot with north winds, which discomforted patrons and wilted flowers.  The following week the Clare show enjoyed ideal weather in much better surroundings and with better facilities.  While Clare has some natural advantages, the Burra racecourse site would surely be better than the Showground ‘with its rocky ground, steep slopes, dangerous arena and cramped treeless surroundings’.
