Burra Swimming Pool.  About 20 people attended the public meeting called by the Mayor to discuss a roster system to allow the pool to open daily.  Arrangements to use about 30 people were made, enabling the pool to open daily, including weekends. The Education Departmentâ€™s learn to swim campaign will be run 3-14 January.
