Burra Slag Extraction Co.  Mr C.A. Lott was severely injured in an accident on Monday morning.  Heavy castings were being unloaded when a casting slipped over the side of the skids causing a piece of timber 6” x 4” x 18’ to fly through the air, grazing his cheek, and knocking him down, breaking his collarbone.  Immediately the shifting weight of the casting caused the timber to be brought down on top of Mr Lott, breaking three ribs.  Had he not fallen in a small gutter he would probably have been crushed to death.  The victim was badly bruised and his face and neck were swollen almost beyond recognition.  Although very painful, the injuries are now mending.
