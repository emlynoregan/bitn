H.B. writes re the want of rain and challenging the view of some that squatters have made large fortunes:

After 25 miles from Burra  and for 100 miles northeast there is noting but red earth and clouds of dust for four or five miles around all the wells and watering places.  On several runs within 60 miles of Burra thousands of pounds have been spend on wells with little success.  One run within 30 miles has sunk 12 to 15 wells from 80 to 140 feet and altogether they cannot water 3,000 sheep.  Another run has sunk four wells to over 100 feet and found no water.  Many wells sunk in the area are costly, being dug in hard rock and many are also unproductive.  At this time of year the sheep are drinking from wells just as they do in summer and a flock of 1,400 ewes with lambs will drink 75 to 80 hogsheads of 60 gallons of water every other day.  Each sheep will drink 2 to 3 gallons every other day.  Even in a good year like 1863 the flocks needed wells except for four months and in three out of five years they need wells all the year round.
