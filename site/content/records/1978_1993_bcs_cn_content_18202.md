Burra Picnic Race Club was formed in 1986 as a fundraiser for the benefit of the Burra Aged Persons Hostel and the RFDS.  In the three meetings held $8,500 was handed over to those charities.  Sponsors have been very generous with donations.  The fourth annual race meeting will be held this year on 19 March with the usual Bush Wing Ding on Saturday 18 March and will be fully licensed with a barbecue supper and Western Band.  The Wing Ding will be at the track site at Thistle Beds, 14 km east of Burra and we thank the Kellock Family for making this site available.  A small group of energetic people have spent much time building the track and improving the surrounds.  There will be foot races for kids and side shows.  President, John Maidment; Vice-President, John Oates; Secretary, Sheena Lynch and a committee of 15.
