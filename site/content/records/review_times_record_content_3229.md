The Burra Preservation Organisation discussed the possible removal of Victorian letter boxes from the town and the Burra North by-pass at their meeting on Thursday last.  About 35 people attended.  In response to a request from the Burra Burra DC it was resolved to send them a copy of the petition objecting to the Market Square redevelopment, which had been sent to the Local Government Minister.

They said this would show the Council that 55% of ratepayers opposed the redevelopment.

They were also concerned that the Council condoned the Highway Department’s proposal closing part of Morehead Street between the Redruth Camping Centre and the main road and the deviation of Ludgvan St in a northwest direction.  This is to prevent traffic from using the Black Street Bridge [sic: for the Black Bridge], which is unable to cope with the weight.  Mr Rayfield said the Highways Department had said the bridge was at the end of its life and couldn’t cope with trucks weighing 60-70 tonnes crossing it illegally.  The organisation proposed reinforcing the bridge because the proposal would cut the town in half and destroy heritage items.

The deviation would destroy a disused croquet court and shed.  They were also concerned about the deviation having metre high embankments, which could be the site of an accident.  The deviation would also direct tourists away from the town.

The Post Office proposed to remove two of the three remaining cast iron Victorian letter boxes in the town because they are little used.  The boxes in questions are in Kingston Street and near the Hospital.  The organisation would prefer that the boxes be closed, but remain in position.
