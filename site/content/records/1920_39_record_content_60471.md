Weather and the season.  Recent rains have led to abundant feed to the east, but also to an increase in blow fly strike.  The successful destruction of rabbit burrows from the Burra Burra Council boundary to Morgan has led foxes to turn to lambs and even hoggets.  Fortunately they can be readily baited.
