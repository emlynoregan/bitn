The Burra Mine was visited recently by geologists and residents hope an extensive search of the district will follow.  Recent use of a scintillameter on Yorke Peninsula was unsuccessful, but this instrument has not been tried on Burra.  Cr Bernhardt has suggested the local Council try to get the local field examined with it.
