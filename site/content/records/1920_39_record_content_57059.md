Obituary.  Mr R.H. Lackman died in a private hospital in Perth on Saturday 29 June aged 42.  He was born at Bordertown and joined Elder, Smith in 1910.  In WWI he served with distinction, rising to the rank of Captain and Acting-Major.  When he was discharged he was transferred to WA, where he became the manager of the company’s branch at Narrogin in 1923 and has held the position ever since.  He was a keen golfer and gained the title of Country Champion.  He is survived by a widow and two young children.  ‘Paddy’ Lackman was well known in Burra, as he was at Elder, Smith & Co. in Kooringa prior to WWI and was very popular here.
