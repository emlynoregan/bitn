Henry Cullen was given a morning tea on Friday on his retirement.  His father, Lance took over the Eastern Mail Run in 1949 and Henry has since covered more than a million miles making deliveries on the route.

Lance Cullen began on the run on 1 August 1949.  He had a semi-trailer and carried fuel, general goods and provisions as well as the mail.  The route was Glenora, Woolgangi, Koomooloo, Braeside, Sturtvale, Quondong (overnight stop), Oakbank, Oakvale (near the NSW border), then Oakbank, Morganvale, Canopus, Pine valley, Canegrass, Balah, Redcliffe, Grassville, Koomooloo and back to Burra.  This was a distance of c. 380 miles or 600 km.  Starting at 1.30 p.m. on Friday, they returned at about 6 p.m. on Saturday, if all went well.  On one occasion when heavy rain fell mid-route they returned the following Friday, just in time to re-load and set off again.  Roads were then often just bush tracks and at one time the trip meant encountering 156 gates.  Lance convinced some graziers to install cattle grids, which he delivered free of charge.  In mid-1966 Lance was unsuccessful in the tender for the renewal of the contract and it went to another person.  Lance and Henry then continued with the weekly delivery of goods, fuel and provisions.  It was estimated that in the first seventeen years of the mail contract Lance travelled c. 350,000 miles of 560,000 km.

At other times the Cullens would be out east carting wool.

During 1968 the Cullens regained the mail contract.  Lance Cullen retired from the mail run in April 1969, to be succeeded by son Henry, who carried on for a further 28 years and now is ready to hand the job on to his son Rodney.

About 25 years ago they could do the run with a smaller vehicle because the fuel began to be delivered to the properties in bulk rather than in drums.  The big problem affecting the run was always rain.  At one time the semi-trailer got bogged down to its tray!  Even as recently as last February the run had to be done by two vehicles because the circular route was cut by flood water â€“ in one section to a depth of 6 m.  Some of the road now has a reasonable surface, but there are still 39 gates and sections of bush track.  There have also been changes in the route.  It now includes such stations at South Dam, Kia Ora and Braemar, which lie further north than the original route.  Some of the original stations are no longer occupied.  The service now leaves at 9.30 a.m. and all being well returns at 6 p.m. the same day, having covered c. 530 km.
