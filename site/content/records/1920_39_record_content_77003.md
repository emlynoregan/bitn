St Mary’s.  A letter from S. [Solomon] Williams of 10 Moseley St Glenelg who listened to the jubilee service broadcast from St Mary’s.

He says he left Burra 72 years ago, having spent the first twenty years of his life there.  He attended the day school in the first St Mary’s on Limestone Hill run by Mr & Mrs Oakford.  He lists some of the pupils as Dick Collins (later of Hallett), Bill Pearce (late of Bath & Pearce), Tommy Sampson & Billy Symons (both of whom lived near the old bridge opposite the Bible Christian Church), Charlie Dryer (who lived ‘up in the paddock’), Jack Billing (who lived with old ‘Maester’ Gordon near Dr Mayne’s in Commercial St) – that was in 1854.  He was there when Rev. Pollett was Rector, but doesn’t remember seeing him.  [Rev. Pollitt 1846-55.]  He does remember Rev. D.J.H. Ibbitson.  [Rev. Ibbetson Rector 1855-61.]  He was influential in establishing the Institute.  He wonders if there is anyone left in Burra who he knew or to whom he was known.  If so he would like to correspond.
