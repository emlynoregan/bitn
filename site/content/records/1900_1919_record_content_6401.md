Obituary.  J.R Gray died at Redruth on Sunday afternoon [21 September] aged 74.  For about 30 years he was the inspector for the Burra Corporation.  [This cannot be correct as the Corporation only dates from 1876 and I don’t think he was the only person to hold the position, but he was a very long-serving inspector.]  He carried out his duties in an eminently satisfactory manner.  He was quite impartial treating all owners of stock alike whether Mayors or Councillors.  He is known to have paid the fines of some poor residents from his own pocket.  The excellent sanitary condition of the town is in great measure due to his insistence on his notices being carried out.  In former years the inspector got part of the fines, but more recently all have gone to the Council, lest people get the idea that the inspector was discovering stray stock for personal profit.  Mr Gray was well till last Wednesday, though a little pale and complaining of a slight cold.  He took to his bed on Thursday.  He leaves a wife and three young children, the eldest of them 4 years old.  [This obituary is notable for what it omits.  John Robinson Gray’s first wife was born Sarah Ann Lenton and she died in 1897.  They had two children.  The first was Martha Lenton Gray, well known in Burra as Nurse Woollacott who married Alexander Feltus later in life.  The second was Alfred David Gray.  The second marriage to Fanny Elizabeth Tohl was in 1898 when she was 23 and there were three children as stated above: John Robinson Gray (1898), Emily Helena Gray (1900) & George Hensman William (1900).  Not mentioned of course was Charles Allan Gray who came along in 1903.]
