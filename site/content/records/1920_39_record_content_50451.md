Obituary.  Miss Margaret O’Leary died at her residence at 5 a.m. Sunday morning last.  She was the elder daughter of the late Mr & Mrs John O’Leary butchers and was in her 81st year.  Miss Margaret O’Leary [sic] her younger sister is now the only surviving member of that family.

[Margaret Agnes O’Leary died 15 April 1934 at Kooringa aged 80.  The survivor was not of course Margaret, but Mary Teresa O’Leary who died 14 May 1937 when her age is variously said to be 75 or 77, but her registered birth might have been 24 October 1857, making her 79, though that birth to John O’Leary & Margaret Callaghan is simply registered as Mary.  Another obituary see 55, 17, 25 Apr. 1934, page 2 seems an effort to correct this, but it gives the date of death as 13 April and if Sunday is correct above it was the 15th.]
