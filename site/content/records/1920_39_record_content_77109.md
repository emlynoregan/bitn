Burra Burra Show Inc. met on Wednesday last.  R. Fairchild has offered to plant and care for any trees planted on the showgrounds.  I.J. Warnes has offered to supply as many trees as required.

A.B. Riggs responded to the Burra Progress Associationâ€™s criticism of the side-show issue.  He felt it would have been fairer to extend criticism to the side-show men and their Guild, who were the ones at fault.  Mr Riggs was acting on behalf of both the Burra Burra Show Inc. and the Northern Country Shows Assoc. when he offered the compromise that they pay the 1/- fee and then ask for a refund of 6d, which would be dealt with at the February meeting of the Assoc.  After all if, as they claimed, they had not paid more than 6d at a number of shows, they had every chance of a refund.  Now the Burra Progress Assoc. had that chance of a refund.  The Burra Show Committee had kept faith with patrons without allowing the side-showmen to run the show.
