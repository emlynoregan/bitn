‘Outside Rider’ of Terowie writes concerning the Anzac Sports.  These had always been carried out in an excellent way, with much support and many participants from surrounding towns.  Now, by handing the sports over to organisers who do nothing but cycle riding and running for a living, and with increased rewards on offer, they are likely to get fewer nominations from the smaller towns where they do not have the experience or the advantages to compete against such class.  The nature of the sports will change and ‘I just want to ask public opinion in this matter concerning the sporting point’.
