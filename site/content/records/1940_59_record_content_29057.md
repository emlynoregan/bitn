The Swimming Pool Plan

The Under Treasurer has agreed to allow the Council to spend Â£400 borrowed for the purpose of building a swimming pool when conditions permit.  Council has agreed to hold the matter over until the new year, by which time they will have more precise details of the plan and costs and cement might be more readily available.
