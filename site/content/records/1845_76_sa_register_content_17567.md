‘One of 32Years’ Standing’ writes re Mines and Minerals in SA.

[This is a long letter, but the essence of his complaint is that prospectors and miners are poorly treated in SA.  Among his complaints:

It is as expensive for a miner to get 80 acres surveyed as for a squatter to get 80 square miles.

Sheep farmers can get 5 acres for 1d, while miners pay 50/-.

Why is this important industry so neglected by the Government?  Roads have a Board, surveyors and other staff.  Maritime and Harbours warrant another Board and staff.  Mining occupies a corner of an office devoted to various other matters and the partial services of a clerk.

What is needed is completely free right to search for minerals and then the untrammelled occupation of small or large areas according to the means of the occupants.  This would result in a healthy increase in imports, larger consumption of local products and an immense additional export of copper.]
