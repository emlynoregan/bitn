Kooringa Court, 7 November

Gubbins v. MacInnerny

Gubbins claimed £5 for a bag of flour purchased from the defendant as the best fine flour.  It turned out to be grossly inferior.  Robert Roach and J.W. Moore, bakers of Kooringa testified to the inferior quality of the flour and said it was fit only for pigs.  Several other witnesses proved both the inferior quality of the flour and the warrant given by the defendant.  Gubbins was awarded £5 plus costs.  A series of cases of a similar nature saw awards of £5 and costs to Bennett, Godden, Bowden, Vivian, Symons, Lutze, Andrews, Lane and Torr.

Barclay sued Thompson for £1-14-4 for board and lodging and won the same.
