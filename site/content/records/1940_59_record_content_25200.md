Burra Town Council, 4 February

N.E. Schultz of Eudunda wrote stating he and another person were interested in opening a butchery business and a bakery in Burra and asking the Council if there was any possibility.

It was reported that Mr Burt Broad had the necessary permission to open a butchery business and there was the possibility of a baker opening in Burra North.

Mr Schultz is to be informed that a returned soldier is opening a butchery business in Burra.

The RSPC wrote saying it considered the Council Pound dog kennels inadequate.  The kennels will be renovated.

The Burra Electric Supply Co. indicated that stronger lights had been installed at Farmers’ Union, Keir’s, Sara’s (Burra North) and the Railway Crossing.  A new lamp has been installed in front of the Bank of Australia [sic: for Australasia] and the Rotunda lights would be repaired.

It was resolved to call tenders for kalsomining the Town Hall with quotes for including the ceiling and without the ceiling.

A motion was carried calling for:

Victoria Park playing surface to be lightly graded.

Victoria Park gum trees to be lightly lopped.

Gravel to be placed at Finch’s corner on the way to Princess Royal.

The Hospital tennis courts to be repaired.

Weeds at the cemetery to be killed.

Chairs at the Town Hall are to be repaired.

A question was asked whether the Council could lease the Kooringa tennis courts to the Burra Kooringa Methodist Church Club or whether there was already an existing lease with the Kooringa Tennis Club.  The Mayor said that club had walked away from the courts.

Cr Jennison wondered if the lease had been paid.  The Clerk will investigate.
