Burra Burra DC

A number of people in town are keeping horses in closer proximity to houses than is allowed; at least 100 feet from a house is required.  They are not always in hygienic conditions.

The Apex Club has mown the grass at the Burra North Playground and cleaned up rubbish.  They will soon install barbecues and repair the swings and seating.

Fees at the caravan park will rise from 1 April to $2.75 a night for a caravan and $2 for tents (including power).

Tenders have been accepted for the sealing on another 1-5 km [sic: 1.5?] of the Burra-Farrell Flat-Clare Road; from Farrell Flat to near the railway crossing.
