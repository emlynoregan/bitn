The paper then publishes, at the request of C.G. Tiver, a letter from E.E. Thamm JP to J.E.H. Winnall dated 11 June in which he denies that he had charged Mr Tiver with using bad language in church and adding that nothing would have been heard from him (Thamm) had not ‘a stupid and untruthful report appeared in the press'.

A second letter dated 18 May is also published.

[This date is puzzling because the original press report appeared on 30 May and refers to an incident that occurred ‘last Sunday’, which would thus have been 27 May and even if it had been a week earlier it would have occurred on 20 May.]

In this letter E.E. Thamm accepts an apology from C. Tiver for an incident in church.  He says he has talked with Rev. Bridgwood over the matter.  He has never thought lightly when the National Anthem was being sung and was deeply moved for the boys at the front, having close relations in the fighting line.  He says that on reflection he will sing the National Anthem in the future and expresses sympathy for one who has lost a son in the conflict.

C. Tiver writes that on receiving the above he would have let the matter drop, but for Mr Thamm’s outburst following the paper report [on 30 May] where Mr Thamm says Tiver’s language ‘might have caused the King to blush’, which surely is an accusation of the use of bad language and a reference to ‘whitewash’ and ‘bulged eyes’ – but he assumes Thamm’s supply of ink will eventually run out as Thamm uses it ‘not only on me, but on several other well respected men of our town’. 

[This is presumably a reference to Thamm’s recent altercations with Council members, but there may have been other unpublished matters as well.]
