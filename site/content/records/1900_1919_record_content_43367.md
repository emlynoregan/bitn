The British League is a society of young men who have hired a room in Queen St.  On Wednesday they farewelled Robert Jones who has been at Walker & Sons for 13 months.  He has been a member and librarian of the Burra Band.

Mr J.M. McBride was invited to Adelaide to ‘set’ a post in the construction of the Cheer-up Hut in recognition of his generosity to the cause.  After French Flag Day he subsequently handed on a further cheque for £200 to be credited to Burra’s effort.  After the ceremony in Adelaide he presented another £100 which we understand is to be credited to Burra Cheer-up Day.
