Burra Anzac Sports were organised by the Burra RSL and were held on the Burra Racecourse last Saturday.  This year’s event did not approach the pre-war standards, but it did exceed last year’s.  The weather this year was perfect.  Last year’s total takings were £77 and this year’s amounted to £83.  The grounds were comfortably filled.  Entries for the cycle races numbered 37 from country and city; up from only 13 last year.  F. Thomas won the Two Mile Anzac Wheel Race and K. Thurgood won the First Class Scratch Race.

The horse racing events were interesting, but more entries were needed.  [Results are printed.]
