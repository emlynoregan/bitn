[The editor makes rather a weak defence, saying:

‘We certainly made no charge against the butchers.’

But on 7 August he had said in a long article on the matter:

‘Immediately before the appearance of the disease, cattle suffering from pleuro in an advanced stage were sold to a butcher or butchers in this town, some dying before they could be brought in, and the rest, for all the evidence to the contrary, being disposed of in the usual way.  Beef was purchased and eaten by persons affected who, it is affirmed preferred their meat underdone.  The suggestions of cause and effect appear complete.’

This sounds as though it might be interpreted as a ‘charge against the butchers’!]
