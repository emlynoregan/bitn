By advancing £1,500 to match the sum placed on the estimates by the Government you will be adding to your own resources annually.  The reduction in transport distance for ores of 6 or 7 miles will save £1,500 on every 10,000 tons of ore as well as other economies.

It will also be a benefit to other mines in the colony.

It remains to be seen whether you will be fools enough to continue to sacrifice this sum annually for the benefit of the SA Company.
