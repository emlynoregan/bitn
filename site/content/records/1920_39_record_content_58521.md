Mongolata Goldfield

Baldina Mongolata GM Syndicate for the three weeks to 7 November.

A new tunnel was driven across the north portion of Lean’s Hill for 35 ft in decomposed sporadic limestone with small quartz veins.

Farnden’s Hill: open cut operations were continued to 60ft.  Values in the seam are low on the south end, but showing gold on the north end.  A small patch of specimen gold was recovered – about 25 oz.  We expect to have a parcel of 10 tons of ore for the battery by the end of November.
