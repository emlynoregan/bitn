Burra Town Council, 18 June

Mr McGubbin of the SA National Gallery wrote on the subject of the painting of the late Dr Brummitt, which is in a bad condition.  Mrs Forsythe (Dr Brummittâ€™s daughter) wrote on the same subject and enclosed a photograph of the painting, which she suggested be enlarged.  She said the photograph was a good one and much superior to the painting.

It was resolved to have the photograph enlarged.
