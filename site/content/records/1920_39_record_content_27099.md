Redruth Court, 31 May

George Alfred Williams (engine driver) & William Clement J. Faulkner (cleaner) of the SAR were charged with having 17 fish in their possession on 24 May which might reasonably be suspected as being stolen.  The informant was F.R.L. Gibson, stationmaster of Burra.

The case is reported at length running to 3½ columns.

The stationmaster had found the fish in possession of the men at the railway barracks and had earlier noticed a slit in the bagging over a case of fish on the platform.

[Incidentally the barracks are described as being 200 yards south of the station and as comprising four bedrooms, a dining room, kitchen & bathroom, with a wood stove at the north end of the kitchen.  The WC was a pit closet 20 yards from the barracks.]

William R. Ridgway, porter, gave evidence of the location of the box of fish, its condition and the whereabouts of the accused at crucial times.  He had noticed the tear in the cover and that the box felt lighter.

M-C Geoffrey Webster gave evidence of the recovery of fish from various places at and near the barracks including the WC, amounting in all to 17.

The defence lawyer did his best to throw doubt on the validity of the evidence and the identification of the fish.

Sgt McDonald also gave evidence of the search for the fish and the discovery of fish scales in various places.

The defence counsel Mr Bright continued to object whenever possible.  He also gave the statements of the accused which sought to explain that Williams had bought 4 or 5 fish from a person he could not identify.  Faulkner had also bought fish.  Mr Bright had advised them to plead guilty and said it appeared to him to be the result of a drunken spree which would blight the lives of two young men and was likely to lead to both of them losing their jobs.

Williams was 36 with one child and lived at Terowie.  He had been in Government employment for 20 years.  He said he had as a result lost both his job and his home.

Faulkner was 26 and employed as a cleaner.  He lived at Terowie and was to have acted as a fireman that evening.

The railway authorities asked for imprisonment.  Mr Bright asked for leniency.

Williams was fined £30 + court fees or six months.

Faulkner was fined £15 + court fees or three months.  (Williams had previous convictions.)

They were allowed one month to pay.
