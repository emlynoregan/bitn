Salvation Army.  Advt. for 11 a.m. Holiness Meeting on Sunday.

[This appears to be the last advertisement for a Salvation Army Service in Burra and could indicate the end of services in Burra, or at least of regular services.  Advertisements for Home League meetings continued till 30 July and they then also ceased.  The last mention of a resident officer seems to have been in August 1955.  In 1956 Burra was being serviced from Clare.]
