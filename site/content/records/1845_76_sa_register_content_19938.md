The Port Wakefield Tramway

[Quite a long article reports evidence given to a select committee on this subject.  The conclusion is that the port might be improved at moderate expense and a tramway 26 miles long to the Broughton would be a great advantage.  It was far more difficult to get any agreement on the construction of east-west connections.]
