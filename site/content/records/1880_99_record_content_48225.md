Fire broke our at T. Warnes’ paddock at Kooringa on Saturday afternoon.  This threatened the brewery paddock, but the fire did not manage to leap the Baldina Road.  Last year there were two fires in the brewery paddock and one in T. Warnes’. 

Fire also broke out in Mr Frederick’s paddock at Redruth on Tuesday, but was extinguished.  J.R. Gray who brought home a bag used in fighting the fire failed to notice it was smouldering and placed it in his coach-house.  A few minutes later the building was in flames and considerable damage was done before it was extinguished.

Another fire occurred in Mr T. Warnes’ paddock on that day too and destroyed several acres of grass.
