Burra Football Assoc. met last Wednesday.  Association applications came from North Booborowie, South Booborowie, Mt Bryan, Aberdeen & Kooringa.  Associationâ€™s teams are to be the same as last year.  Elected were Secretary, E. Jackson; Patron, I.J. Warnes; President W.A. Radford [perhaps M.A.?]; Treasurer, J. Allen.

A move to allow players to select any one team to play in for the season was deferred for consideration: the boundary of the Association to be a 30 mile radius from Kooringa Post Office.
