There are also complaints about the timetable, which has been changed to the disadvantage of many, but especially those attending the saleyards.  The editor considers that allowing four hours for a journey of 100 miles is hardly a great sign of advancement.

[It is not possible to indicate the real nature of the problem here because the timetable that is printed in the paper is exactly the same as that printed in February 1910!]
