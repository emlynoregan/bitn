An RAF Mosquito Aircraft flew over Burra & Mt Bryan areas on 24 July.  Piloted by F/Lt Garrard, the plane the plane proceeded to ‘Belcunda’ homestead with F/O Maxwell as passenger.  F/O Maxwell and F/Lt Bowley, both of the RAF, have been spending their leave with Mr & Mrs Stanley Hawker.  F/O Maxwell went to Adelaide to meet his friend F/Lt Garrard of an RAF Mosquito Squadron and as F/Lt Garrard had some refresher flying to do, he was able to fly his friend over ‘Belcunda’.  This is probably the first time one of these Mosquito planes has flown over the district.  F/O/ Maxwell and F/Lt Bowley were guests of the Burra RSL at their last meeting.

[The paper has F/Lt Howley on his second mention.]
