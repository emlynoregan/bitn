Foresters Junior Members had a picnic at Stone Chimney Creek on Mr Herbert Morgan’s property on the Monday holiday.  These picnics were for many years an annual event at Johnson’s Creek, but more recently they lapsed and instead the lads were given tickets for the annual seaside trip.  This year with no seaside trip the picnic was reinstated.  In Burra the day was cold, but at the picnic in thick scrub the keenness was scarcely noticed.  With the Brass Band as an escort the boys headed off on a fleet of lorries at about 9 a.m.  Many of the Senior Lodge also attended.  The sports program was greatly enjoyed and results are printed.  Stan Kellaway Jnr particularly impressed at the open high jump where he cleared 5’9”.
