Burra Show 1995

The show went very well, with a record attendance.  Gate takings were a record – up about 30% on recent years.  Entries in the horse sections were at record levels, though cooking, produce and children’s sections were down somewhat.  Shearing returned after being absent for some years and the trade stands were well represented.
