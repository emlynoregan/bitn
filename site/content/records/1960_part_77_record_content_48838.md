Burra National Trust held its AGM in the CWA Rooms.  Elected: President, L. Moore; Vice-President, G. O’Connor; Secretary, Mrs C. O’Connor; Treasurer, D. Cockington and Research Officer, Ian Auhl.  Tribute was paid to Mr & Mrs S.J. Woollacott for their work in keeping the Market Square Museum open.  The Trust has purchased a line and wash drawing of Market Square from Mrs J. Barker’s exhibition of paintings and drawings at the RSL Hall last weekend.

The inspection of Princess Royal has been rescheduled for April.  G.S. Hawker urged the Trust to apply to the Stud Breeders’ Association for a few representative photographs of important sheep to be displayed in the Museum.  The meeting concluded with T.G. Perry showing slides of the way buildings in the UK and Europe were being preserved.
