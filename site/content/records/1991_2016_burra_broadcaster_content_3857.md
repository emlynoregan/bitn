Burra Hospital

Following on from the Health Towards 2000 Needs Survey, comes the Audit Commission Report on Health in SA and a new funding model called Casemix Funding, which will be introduced into most hospital, including Burra, from July.  Recommendations from the Needs Survey are in the process of being adopted, said John Chilton, Hospital CEO on Monday.  A recent advertisement for an additional Mental Health Professional in the region did not attract an applicant and will be readvertised.  This was an unmet need in the survey.  The Hospital will be preparing a Local Services Register for distribution.  The Audit Commission has other recommendations yet to be adopted.  Regionalisation of services is recommended and is favoured by the Government.  Consequences for small hospitals like Burra are unknown, but it seems likely that some core services like surgery would be centralised, giving smaller hospitals more of a primary care role.  From 1 July 1994 hospitals will be more competitive and there will be casualties among hospitals not patronised by their local communities or which are identified as inefficient.  Under Casemix Funding the hospitals will only be paid for what they do.  It will be a case of use it or lose it.
