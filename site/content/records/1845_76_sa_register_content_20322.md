Kooringa News, 27 March

Burra Mine is now idle.  All underground men ceased work today.  The dressers will be kept at work for about a month.  The officers and captains will then leave and the place will be deserted.

Fire.  A fire broke out in Mr Bock’s hairdressing premises on 21 March.  Mr Bock found some matches, paper and concertinas alight under his counter.  He could not fight the fire as his tank was empty, but neighbours responded with water from their tanks and it was put out after doing sone £15 damage.  His is the only insured premises in the row of buildings.  Has the fire spread it would have destroyed seven more houses, some of them containing tradesmen’s stores.

At least one local man believes the report of gold being discovered at the Barrier Ranges.  He and two of his sons will leave for there on Monday next.
