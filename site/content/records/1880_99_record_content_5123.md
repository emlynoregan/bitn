Early Closing.   A meeting was held last Tuesday evening in Mr Whiteâ€™s schoolroom in the interests of early closing.  Rev. F. Richmond took the chair.  The meeting urged the closing of stores at 6 p.m. on Saturdays.  Late shopping was a habit rather than a necessity.  The committee appointed comprised Messrs White, W. West, Urwin, Edwards and Richards.
