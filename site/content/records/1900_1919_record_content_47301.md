Burra Town Council.

The request to the PMG for mail to close in the morning has been refused.

Hon. J. Lewis agrees to accept the Councilâ€™s lease as offered except for the impounding clauses.

Cr McBride suggested some of the slagheap be tried for blending [sic: blinding?] and suggested a trial near the Black Bridge.  Carried.

The Mayor said he understood the Aberdeen Post Office was about to be separated from the store and a postmaster appointed.
