Wilcannia & Points North, Part 6

Though wild camels and cattle further north beckoned, we turned back south.  We wished to avoid returning by the track we had come on, with its endless loose stones and steep creek crossings.  The mail driver recommended the Momba Track.  The risk was that if it rained it would become very sticky.  The track went within a mile or two of Tongo Homestead and then turned decidedly south towards Wilcannia.  The track was not too bad, especially across dry clay pans.  Cattle, kangaroos and emus shared the knee-deep grass.  After Momba it was only 43 miles to Wilcannia, but the road deteriorated and slowed us down.  The 117 miles trip in all had taken 6-7 hours.  Then it was back to Broken Hill and a visit to the Flying Doctor Base, before returning to Burra.
