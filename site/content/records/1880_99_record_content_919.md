Burra Town Council, 3 May

The butchers of the town who use the slaughterhouse did not incline towards binding themselves to do so and so the Mayor could not advise the Council to continue in possession.  Consequently Cr Batchelor moved that the lease of the slaughterhouse offered by SAMA be declined.  Carried.

It was resolved to redeem £100 bond this year and the other £100 bond to be renewed for a year.
