Burra Rural Youth welcomed Joe Fillmore and Brian Thomas as new members at their meeting on 24 September.  Members decided to run the cool drinks, ice cream and sweets stall at the Burra Show and following business there was a social evening for Miss Avis Stockman, who was presented with a box of silver teaspoons.  [Avis Stockman and Joy Pettet were two past members who were about to be married.]
