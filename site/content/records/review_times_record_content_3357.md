Burra Burra Dc is negotiating with the AWU over the employment of five workers.  District Clerk Mr R. Walsh said that reports that five men had been sacked were incorrect.  He believed a deputation would be made to the Minister of Transport Mr Keneally to discuss the issue of road funding for 1986-87.  A media report on Tuesday had cited the President of the local Government Associated as saying that five men had been laid off.  Mr Walsh said the Council was concerned about future employment levels which relied on Highways Department contracts, especially in the light of projected budget cuts of $30 million.
