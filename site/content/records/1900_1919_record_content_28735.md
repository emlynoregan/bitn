Obituary.  (From the Cootamundra Herald 6 January.)  Mr Henry Scott of ‘Milton’ Cootamundra died on Thursday night after being a chronic sufferer.  He arrived in SA when aged seven from Scotland – five years before it was created a province and eleven before it was a crown colony and nearly twenty before it gained responsible government.*  He married a daughter of a fellow colonist (Elizabeth Thompson) who survives with three sons and six daughters: Murray & Percy Scott of Dirnaseer and the third son who lives in Adelaide.  The daughters are Mrs Whyte & Mrs Richardson of SA and the Misses Alice, Janet, Edith & Nellie of ‘Milton’.  There are five grandchildren.  Mt Scott was a well-known and respected pastoralist.  His station was Braefoot nine miles from Burra SA.

[* The underlined sentence is nonsense.  Henry Scott was born in Scotland in 1836 and arrived in SA in 1839 with his parents according to BISA information.]
