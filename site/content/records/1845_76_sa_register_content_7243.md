SA Gold

J.M. Solomon writes expressing his disappointment at the apparent apathy of the South Australian public when it comes to searching for gold in SA.  He suggests a subscription list to establish a reward for the discoverer of gold in payable quantities.

Victorian Gold from the Melbourne Morning Herald, 1 October.

A letter from Buninyong dated 28 September says:

There are far richer diggings here than in California or Sydney.  Every man is doing well and our party in four days took 80 pounds weight of gold out of our hole.  Goodness knows how much more there might be left there.

At Kyneton so many persons were digging for gold that water-carriers and wood-carriers had deserted their occupations and customers could not get baked break and had resorted to damper.

The Geelong Advertiser has an important letter from a reporter at Ballarat.  Surface workings have been abandoned and riches are being pursued underground.  The yield is immense and apparently inexhaustible.  Tin dishes often yield one or two ounces in a single washing.  The wildest reports fall short of the reality.  September has proved quite remarkable.  Fortunes have been made in a few hours.  Diggers who have gone down a hole in the morning have emerged at sunset with a competence.

[The writer adjoins a tabular statement from which a number of amazing facts emerge.]

The table shows that a Ballarat for the period covered there were 143 cradles and 567 men who produced 4,010 ounces worth £12,030 of gold (present value £3 per ounce).  The largest production was 314 ounces by 10 men in 14 days.  The smallest production was 1 ounce by four men in four days, but 29 parties comprising 112 men, met with no success.

For the whole field the average is 1 oz 6 dwt 2 gr per man per day.  This has been calculated on the number of cradles, to which must be added innumerable tin dishes and dispersed cradles.

[The article goes on to talk of gold escorts and to cite sums for individual parties.]
