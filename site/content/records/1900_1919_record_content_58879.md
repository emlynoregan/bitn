Burra Town Council

Cr Sampson moved that a pipe be laid in the Pig & Whistle Ford.  Carried.

The installation of two electric streetlights by Glenister & Sams was reported.

The Mayor asked permission to retire from the Hospital Board following what he regarded as its inappropriate behaviour re the matronâ€™s dismissal.  The Council held the view that they needed a representative on the Board regardless of his personal feelings in the matter and declined his request.
