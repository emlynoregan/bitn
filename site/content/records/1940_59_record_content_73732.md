Weather.  Burra had a total of 345 points for July and 1,534 so far for 1956.  Seeding continues for some farmers, while others have wonderful looking crops.  Some who began early have yellow crops in flat country due to excess water.  Bush, clover and other grasses are doing well in the Eastern Country, which is having a good season.
