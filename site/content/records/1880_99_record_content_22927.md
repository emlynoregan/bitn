Letter pointing out that the football match planned for 1 September at Clare clashes with the battalion drill due either at Hamley Bridge or Caltowie.  The writer fears that ‘Quiz’ is a volunteer who fails to practice what he preaches, i.e. that success only comes by regular attendance and practice.
