Burra Institute.  The AGM was held on Friday 30 January.

Unlike other AGMs in recent years, it was relatively well attended and this must have been encouraging for the four Trustees Messrs E.F. Marston, C.D. Wilkinson, G.E. Dane and A.B. Riggs.  Nevertheless the absence of many citizens shows an appalling indifference to town affairs.  Mr E.F. Marston presided.

The statement of receipts and expenditure showed that income had exceeded expenditure.

Mr Riggs read the annual report.

The Trustees had maintained the standard of the library for the past year.  Subscriptions on 31 December 1941 were £7-5-2 in arrears, which is a loss to the library of £2-7-7 in subsidy.

[Details of the number of books held, borrowing etc. were then recounted.]

The year had been a difficult one for the Trustees with income down due to the falling off of visiting companies and other uses except those events held for patriotic purposes.  These had been allowed a 33⅓% concession, which somewhat reduced the income.  The existing arrangement with the Talking Picture Company had been an improvement on previous terms.

During the year negotiations with the Town Council for the transfer of the Institute property to the Council had taken place.  The subscribers had offered the property to the Burra Corporation:

If the purchase price was equal to the liability to the State Bank on the day of transfer.

The Council paid all transfer costs.

The two rooms used for the library and reading room remained available to the Institute Committee as a library.
