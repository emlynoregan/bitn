Burra Show Society Committee Meeting 21 June

The Governor advises he could possibly attend.  The railcar from Adelaide will leave 30 minutes ahead of the ordinary train.  There will also be a train from Terowie.

The Dog Trials were not a financial success, but fulfilled other aims of the society in aiding breeders of dogs.  Other arrangements for the show are reported.
