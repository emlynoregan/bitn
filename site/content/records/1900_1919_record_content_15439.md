Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting, Burra Institute on Wednesday evening.

Only three or four were present at 8 p.m.  Mr C. Fuss was elected chairman.  During the evening numbers increased, but never to more than twenty.

The Mayor Mr Winnall read his report.  The year’s work had been carried out with economy and on the whole harmoniously.

Cr Drew had little to add.  He agreed with the Mayor and said he was in favour of making footpaths, tree planting and tar dressing.

Cr Neville thanked Councillors for their assistance and hoped he had given ratepayers satisfaction.

Cr Launder’s remarks were in a similar vein.

The Mayor’s Report was adopted.

Mr Drew as candidate for the Mayoralty said he had no fixed policies, but to promote the interests of the town.  He would like to see the footpath from Kooringa to Aberdeen tar dressed, but present money did not allow it.  Additional lights were needed and a new assessment too.

Cr Launder was in favour of kerbing.

Mr S. Burns said electors should allow him to do work in his own way if he were elected.

Candidates agreed that if a new assessment were made it would be lower than the present one and therefore the rate would have to rise.

Mr Hardy asked Councillors if they were in favour of refraining from ‘looking for work’, seeing that so much money had been spent on public works.

Generally the response was that there was more than enough that yet needed to be done without looking for projects to spend money on just for the sake of spending it.
