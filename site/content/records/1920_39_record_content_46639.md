Redruth Court, 28 June

Percy Roy Allen & Harold Allen pleaded guilty to assaulting Cr C.R. Bevan.

An argument had arisen at the mine quarry over certain metal raised by the defendants.  Harold had used abusive language towards Cr Bevan and then moved to strike him.  When prevented by the Mayor Percy Roy had then knocked Cr Bevan over a heap of metal and on his getting up had hit him again.  Percy Roy Allen in defence said that Cr Bevan had called them a pair of b ______ shirkers, but he would not repeat it under oath.  A fine of £5 was imposed, but considering their circumstances it was reduced to 10/- plus £1 court costs.  The complainant did not ask for costs.
