Red Cross Aids (formerly VSD) sponsored a dance on Friday and realised £63 that will aid the POW Fund.  It was the most outstanding dance of the season both socially and financially.  Supper was well organised, but some means will soon have to be devised to handle the rationing problem when one thinks of the constant drain on patriotic workers’ stores.
