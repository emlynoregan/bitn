Accident.  Police are investigating the death of a 27-year-old Adelaide man from a paragliding accident in the Burra district and are preparing a report for the coroner.  [Page 3 adds a few more details.  The accident occurred on Mt Bryan a week ago when the manâ€™s parachute was caught by a gust of wind just before take-off.  He was flung into the air and then dumped, causing fatal internal injuries.]
