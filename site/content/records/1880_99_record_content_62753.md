Inspector Gray charged Charles Parks with selling a 2 lb loaf that was 1½ oz light.  Mr Winnall, for Parks, tried to show that:

The wind may have affected the scales.

When the loaf was broken apart the ‘robbing’ may have accounted for the difference in weight.  [i.e. more may have gone with the other half of the loaf.]

The defendant said he had weighed the other bread at the shop and found none underweight and that they always allowed 4 oz over when weighing the dough.  As only one loaf was weighed and found wanting the second of the arguments above saw the case dismissed.
