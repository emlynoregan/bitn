He said his brother had been into Mt Mary on 4 May and seemed to have had a drink when he returned.

That night at about 7 o’clock he noticed his brother’s bicycle had gone.

At about 10 a.m. on 5 May he noticed his brother’s .303 rifle had gone and about 40 bullets were missing from a box in the shed.

He did not know where his brother had gone.

His brother had appeared upset, but witness did not know the cause.
