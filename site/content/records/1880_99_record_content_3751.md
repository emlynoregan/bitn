Was for an outer harbour for Adelaide.

Was in favour of Chinese labour for the Northern Territory and noted that SA had only 83 Chinese engaged in gardening and other pursuits.

He was in favour of compulsory education and believed it gave value for money.  It was, he believed, a case of spending money on schools or on gaols.

Also favoured high schools.

He saw no need for taxation.  The civil service could easily save the £100,000 needed from its budget of £892,000 and so avoid taxation.

If a tax were to be imposed then he favoured an income tax and a Stamp Act.

He favoured Sunday Closing, but was satisfied to leave it to local option.

Mr Ward’s Meeting, at the Burra Hotel, 6 April.

[Not surprisingly this is not so well reported.]

If a tax was needed it should be an income tax and not a property tax.

Little else is reported, merely that he went over ground already well reported.
