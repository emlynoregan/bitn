A Concert in aid of the Wesleyan Sunday school was held at the Lecture Hall on 27 December.  Among a host of performers Mr J. Roach entertained the audience with a sermon on the text ‘Old Mother Hubbard’, which was a satire on preachers who make a text of scripture mean anything they fancy. (It was the performance of a piece written by a Presbyterian minister.)

Proceeds were satisfactory.
