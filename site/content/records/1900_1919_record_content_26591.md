Letter.  ‘Warning’ writes with reference to the recent Market Square fire, saying that behind the shops in Market Square there was a festering mass of rubbish that authorities had allowed to accumulate.  There was a foul stench apparently arising from a mass of ancient eggs and very bad fruit, under a pile of cases and other timber.  This should not be allowed in any circumstances.
