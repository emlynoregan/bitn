W.H. Hardy writes to deny he is responsible for the column ‘Burra Jottings’ which was a series of short quips poking fun at locals, particularly the young about town, while identifying them only by oblique references and nicknames which must have been transparent at the time, but at this distance makes them unidentifiable.  Many would have been rendered quite irate by the exposure of their foibles and less creditable escapades.
