Burra Hospital

In April there was a 48% response to a survey of the Hospital’s needs.  It identified the top four needs as:

A female GP to complement the services of the town’s male GP

A women’s health clinic

An additional male GP

An up-grade of the accident and emergency department

Problems were compounded with the introduction pf the Casemix system of funding in July.

When CEO John Chilton resigned the Board employed a consultant firm to undertake a review and in the interim Mrs Lesley Phillips was made acting CEO.
