The Burra Arts Council has been assisting the District Council with a submission to the Arts and Museum Facilities Capital Grants Program for funding to refurbish part of the old Post and Telegraph Office as an art gallery.  The Arts Council will lease the gallery from the District Council.  The up-coming ‘Sidestep’ exhibition will usher in the building’s new role.  This will be an exciting mixed media exhibition for July.  It is the first exhibition from the South Australian Touring Exhibitions Program to be hosted by the Burra Arts Council and features the work of seven SA ceramicists and incorporates also works in photography, drawing, painting, sculpture, jewellery and fabrics and will run from 9-20 July.
