Burra Bicycle & Athletic Club had a meeting on Friday night to wind up the affairs of the last meeting.  The club made a profit of £24-18-4 on the last meet and the total now in hand is £36-1-8.  Mr Alf Birdseye, the secretary, was voted £2 for services rendered.  Pressure of business prevents his continuing in that office.
