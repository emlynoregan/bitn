Burra & District Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial

A meeting on 17 November had a fair attendance.  Another truck of granite has been sent by Mr Tillett.  Mr Guy Makin consulting architect has suggested certain changes to the wording of the monument.  The question of whether the wording should use ‘Town’ rather than ‘Corporation’ of Burra was referred to the Municipal Assoc.  Other suggestions are to be submitted to Professor Henderson.  The stone to complete the base has now arrived.  The Commandant suggests the names on the memorial should include rank, distinction and unit.  Dr Steele said Brigadier-General Leane favoured the omission of all rank and distinction.  The meeting decided to omit all rank and distinction.  The Minister of Defence is to be asked whether the concluding date for the war should be 1918 or 1919.
