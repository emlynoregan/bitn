Burra Burra Miners’ and Mechanics’ Institute

[Editorial comment.  The writer goes on at some considerable length extolling the virtues of intellectual enjoyment and praising communities and individual philanthropists who foster the encouragement of learning and the pursuit of reflective and abstract thought etc. etc.]

‘In communities like our, then, the establishment of a Mechanics’ Institution is a token of improved pecuniary circumstances, affording leisure for the cultivation of higher tastes and means of gratifying them.  We may, therefore, fairly take the opportunity of congratulating the good people of Kooringa on the reviving commercial prosperity and general improvement in circumstances evidenced by the successful efforts they have just been making to lay the foundations of a Mechanics’ and Miners’ Institution at the Burra.’

‘We rejoice to know that they now have the means of mental improvement; but we rejoice still more to know that they have not lost the inclination to use them.’

Many such societies have failed because the management has been confined to a particular class.

‘While they have ostensibly been working men’s societies, they have really been managed by the leisured classes, maintained by them, and have ultimately become evening lounges for their exclusive use.  This evil is judiciously guarded against by the projectors of the Burra Institute; who in addition to the Committee of General Management, have now formed a Working Men’s Committee, specially entrusted with the function of representing the views and wishes of the working classes, for whose benefit the Institute is chiefly designed.’

[The writer then goes on to develop the idea that this is a highly desirable innovation.]

The liberal support promised to the infant institution by the great companies of the district is very pleasing.

This follows the example set in the mining districts of England.  ‘There the wealthy mining proprietors have long been eminent as the foremost in promoting and endowing all local institutions designed to ameliorate the physical condition or assist the mental advancement of the people from whose labour, in combination with their own capital, skill, and experience, they derive their wealth.’
