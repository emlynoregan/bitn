Mr Loveday, the ALP candidate for the Legislative Council by-election, spoke at Burra on Wednesday.  [As well as economic policy matters, Mr Loveday was particularly vocal about the gerrymander that  was a feature of the Legislative Council.  The LCL had 16 seats with 107,000 electorsand the ALP had 4 seats with 49,000 electors.  The restricted franchise for the Council also meant that in 1938, 37,000 women could vote for the Legislative Council, while 200,000 could vote in the House of Assembly.  The ALP would address this inequity.]
