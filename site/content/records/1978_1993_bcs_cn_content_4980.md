The 104th Burra Show [As usual this is incorrect.  It was the 89th Burra Show.]

A fine day drew a good crowd to make the show a great success.  The horses in action were a highlight.  There was a good bird section and excellent participation in Needlework.  Merino sheep and the wool sections were also of great interest.  President Peter Stockman welcomed all.  Shearing was re-introduced this year and proved a crowd-pleaser.  Sporting personality Darryl Hicks was a guest of honour and officially opened the show.
