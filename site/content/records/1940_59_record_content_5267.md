Congregations at St Mary’s have fallen, but this is from an entirely different cause from any lack of leadership.  The decline started well before the arrival of Rev. Gray and since he has come 75 members of the Parish have left the town and only 9 have come in their place.  The Rector is to be congratulated for keeping things going in the face of such losses.

John G. Sara also writes in support of Rev. Gray, mentioning that the Methodist Conference notes with concern the constant drift away from the churches.

Neil Usher of the Methodist Manse at Burra North also writes in support of Sunday observance.

‘Surely if our soldiers are willing to sacrifice their lives for our freedom the sporting and racing public can spare a Saturday afternoon now and then for defence organisation.’
