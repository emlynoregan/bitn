The ‘Items’ column carries several suggestive references to the town’s bands:

‘Opposition Bands.’

‘That last tune on Saturday night savoured very much of lager.’

‘Beer and good music won’t mix.’

‘ I say, “Is that a German Band?”  “Oh no, that is the reformed Burra Band!”  “Oh, I see.”’

[Each reference was separated by a number of other items.]

Burra Town Council, 20 July.

The Mayor, Mr Holder, thanked Council for agreeing to move the meetings to Saturday to suit him.  The Council’s financial position was sound.  Though the year had begun in debit £192-16-3 the half -year had them still in credit £125-2-0.  The Waterworks account was not so healthy with receipts of £239-10-1 and expenditure of £299-3-6, but about £200 of rates is yet to come in.  Ralph Bartle has asked for water to be laid on to his leased property near the smelting works.  This request was referred for a report from the Waterworks Committee.

‘Baton’ reports on the Burra bandsmen.  [The style suggests this might be W.H. Hardy.]

He reports hearing a somewhat erratic practice session somewhere on his peregrinations.

The writer then says he strolled to the No. 2 band at the Institute where they were about to enter and play for the rink so he cannot say more.

The No. 3 band was one concertina, 1 cornet, 1 drum and several timbrels. [Which sounds like the Salvation Army]

It is, he says, silly for a small place like Burra to have two bands: why not do away with animosity and make one good one.
