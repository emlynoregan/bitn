YMCA appeals for support for the YMCA Club House on the Henley Beach foreshore for convalescing soldiers.  The house was built quickly and opened on 8 January 1916 by Lady Galway.  At present it houses 30 men and is run entirely by volunteers.  Mr G. Bull, the Hon. Sec., has arranged for a soldiersâ€™ concert on Monday 3 July and a badge and button sale that day.  On 2 July a united service will be held in the Burra Institute.
