Burra Primary School Parents & Friends Association held its AGM 28 March.

Retiring President M.G. Stockman reported on the past year.

Headmaster Mr Kies was transferred to Adelaide and was replaced by Mr K. Horsnell.  Mr H. Kowald was transferred to Angaston, to be succeeded by Mr Sullivan.

Sports Day was held at the Memorial Oval instead of a picnic.

Many people came to Visiting Day, which was held in conjunction with the High School.

The Town Council supplied trees for Arbor Day.

The school roof has at last been renovated and the well roof and box gutters have been done away with, which should improve the quality of the drinking water too.

A school bus has been instituted to carry students from Hanson and Leighton areas.

The school broadcast system has been redesigned and a new speaker added to help in PT exercises and marching; an expensive, but necessary change.

The Department has acquired the land between the Drill Hall and the school.  Plans are in hand to extend the asphalted area of the yard.

A move is also planned for a new library and toilet block for primary school children on the east side of the school.

Mr Kies, Mr Kowald and Mrs Phillips were farewelled at the end of the year.

The Secretary reported a membership of 53 and an average attendance of 25.  Various items of equipment were purchased for the school as requested by the Headmaster.

[A number of fund raising events are listed.]

Mrs Phillips, the Secretary, moved to Adelaide with her family at the end of the year.

The Christmas break-up was held in individual class parties with ice cream and drinks supplied by the Welfare Club.
