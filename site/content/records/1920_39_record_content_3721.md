Burra Hospital Board

Dr Ashtonâ€™s response to the last letter sent to him is published.  He notes that it is acknowledged that the position now offered is different from that previously held.  He notes that the Chief Secretary has advised that the hospital is now a subsidised hospital.  He thinks it odd that the Board has been reappointed according to processes for a Government Hospital not a subsidised hospital.  He says he is still considering the offer, especially the stipulation he cannot charge professional fees until the hospital liability is discharged and that he must give anaesthetics and consultations free with respect to certain patients for who the other medical man receives an increased salary.  He says figures prove the Board previously received much more money from patient fees that it lost from the patients he formerly was instrumental in admitting.
