The Corricks Co. played to a good house on Tuesday and a better on Wednesday last.  They intend to return about September.  [The performance is not described, but it must have been a vaudeville type variety program since reference is made to marvellous singing, a wonderful comic, Mr Chris Young, and to beautiful pictures thrown on a screen.]
