Burra Burra Show Inc. AGM

Mr R. Mason was elected President.

There was a credit balance of $227.73 after paying $1,295 for the erection of the shearing shed for which donations of $1,044 had been received.  Mr Mason reported on the 1970 show, which was opened on 10 October by the Governor, Sir James Harrison.  The weather was fine, but gate takings were down $30 to $650.  The star attraction was the Mid North Shearing Championships, held for the first time in the new shearing shed.  Horses in Action attracted a record 514 entries.  The wool display was up to its usual high standard and a new event was the Honda Agricultural Motor Cycle Trials, which proved a great success.  Poultry and Birds also had record entries.  Burra & District Schools display was also of a high standard.  Industrial displays were numerous.  Thanks also go to Mrs Val Secombe for her work as secretary.
