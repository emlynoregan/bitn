Burra National Parks Building on Kingston Street opposite Paxton Square was officially opened by Roger Wicks, presiding officer of the Animal & Plant Control Commission, last Friday.  The premises now become the Burra home for the National Parks & Wildlife Service, Goyder Animal & Plant Control Board and the Eastern Districts Soil Board.  The Goyder Animal & Plant Control Board is the oldest such in the state, having been around for 25 years.  This is the first time these bodies have come together to share secretarial staff and premises.
