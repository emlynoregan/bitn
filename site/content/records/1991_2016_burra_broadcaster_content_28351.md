Also, why would an operator of the Centre elect to maintain all the properties and assets involved in the tourist trail?  Surely this is the responsibility of the Council, which has an obligation to seek funding from State and Federal sources to assist.  Why should local ratepayers preserve heritage assets on behalf of all Australian citizens?

To anyone with any financial expertise, commonsense or business savvy, ‘the whole forum was as bad as one could possibly imagine’.
