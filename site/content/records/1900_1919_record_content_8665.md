The Veal Family musical entertainment was of a very high order in the Institute on Monday and as well as solos, duets, trios, quartets, company songs and glees, Indian club and dumb bell exercises were gone through.  Attendance was reduced by heavy rain that fell just as people were about to leave for the hall.
