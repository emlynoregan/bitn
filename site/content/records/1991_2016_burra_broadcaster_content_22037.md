Burra Red Cross thanks all those who enabled the recent Red Cross Calling total to reach $1665.80.  The 41st Zone Conference of the Northern Region was held in Burra in April.  34 members attended and the guest speaker was Tony Thorogood who told how he and Susan came to Burra and established their now very successful Cider Cellar.
