Accident.  The power-line with coloured globes extending across the street from the rotunda, snapped in Wednesday eveningâ€™s wind.  On her way home from the pictures Mrs Walter Nankivell unknowingly trod on the line lying in water on the road, producing sparks and a blue flame.  Fortunately she was wearing rubber soles and was unharmed.  Sen. Constable Kewell saw the incident and Len Bourman from Burra Electric Supply Co. soon repaired the line.
