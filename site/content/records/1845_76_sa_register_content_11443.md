Burra Burra Mechanics’ Institute

[This article takes the form of a long letter from Rev. Ibbetson.]

Last Saturday you pointed out the conditions attached to the Government grant to Institutes before it could be applied for; specifically that the last annual subscription list must have amounted to £100.  Since the Burra Burra Institute has only been going for six months, it cannot literally comply.  Moreover, it is true that subscriptions of over £50 in six months do not guarantee there will be more than £100 in a year.  Nevertheless there are circumstances which would justify Burra’s receiving a £50 share of the money available.

These facts include that there are now 16 life members who have each subscribed £10 and upwards, five 10-year members subscribing £5 each, and since the opening 68 ordinary members at £1 each per annum, though it would not do to assume that those who are backward with their second quarter subscriptions will all be bona fide members.  An additional £30 has been contributed towards the first year expenses.

The first preliminary meeting held with a view to establishing an Institute took place on 7 April 1856.  Whilst all present were agreed on the value and desirability of such an institution, it was decided that the cost was too great to proceed with the project.  I then sought and obtained an interview with the H.E. Sir Richard MacDonnell who expressed his approval of such efforts and who gave me to understand the Government was likely to support such efforts to the extent that the people themselves were able and willing to assist it.

At the first public meeting on the subject, held at the Burra Hotel on 6 June, I mentioned the Governor’s interest and the prospect of Government aid and the promise of support from the SA Mining Association and the English & Australian Copper Company.  About 120 people attended and created a most promising impression.  £93 was subscribed at its close.  A committee was set up and on 22 July I was able to tell the then Colonial Secretary that the funds of the Institute amounted to £525 plus £25 promised toward the first year’s operating costs and to ask His Excellency for a sufficient sum to begin the building, which was estimated to cost £1,000.

The reply was that the Government was prepared to place on the Estimates one third of the cost of a suitable building if it were certified that the remaining two thirds had been paid into a bank to the credit of the Institute.

Some more funds were raised and it was possible to send in a certificate that rather more than £700 stood to the account of the Institute, together with a request that the Government contribution be transferred to the account.

Before the Estimates were brought forward I called on the Colonial Treasurer of the day (Mr Torrens) and was delighted to learn that the sum proposed was equal to that raised locally.  (A sum, I believe of £703 and some shillings.)  I was pleased to communicate this fact to the public on the opening of the building on 27 August 1857.

The Committee, acting on the good faith of the Government entered into contracts for the building and when it was completed a balance remained of about £400.  This balance was far below the sum placed on the Estimates, but a little above that officially promised.

I will not attempt to describe the disappointment felt by the Committee and the public, when, upon Mr Finniss retiring from the office of Chief Secretary, his successor, Mr Torrens, reduced the amount on the Estimates from £700 to £50, although he had spoken to me in the highest terms of our project, and had expressed himself in no doubt that the amount would be passed by the Legislature.

The general interest in the Institute began to flag after this.  On the day of the opening the building was crammed with people, but the hopes of the expectation of the £700 were soon dashed bay the appearance in the papers of the sum of £50 opposite the Burra Institute in the Estimates and the sum of £700 opposite that of a certain artillery battery.

I had taken the precaution of furnishing one of the Members for Burra with all the financial details, requesting him to take up the matter in the House, but this was not done, perhaps because he was not in the House at the time it came up.

I feel it is necessary to lay rhe full story before the public, as otherwise people who have had unfulfilled promises of support brought under their notice, may feel, without a connected statement of the facts, that I am open to the charge of misleading them.

The committee have individually contributed nobly to the Institute, but cannot but feel aggrieved at being compelled to make arrangements for meeting their creditors to the extent of about £300, even after taking credit for the £50 voted for the Institute and the £50 just applied for.
