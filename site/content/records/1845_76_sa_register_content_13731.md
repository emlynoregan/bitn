Kooringa News, 10 October

The German Lutheran Church at Redruth has been in the course of erection for some years and at length is drawing towards completion.  The site where it stands was presented by Mr Graham and nine years ago the foundation stone was laid by the Freemasons.  Before long, however, when the walls were about four feet high, progress was halted by the discovery of gold in Victoria.  The building stayed in this state until building was resumed last year.  The walls, roof, floors and windows are now completed and it just required flooring, plastering and ceiling to make it usable.  It is about 60 ft x 30 ft with 18 ft walls.  It has no architectural pretensions and is built of plain rubble.  The door is between two windows in the middle of one side, three windows at the rear and one at each end.  Great credit is due to the small number of subscribers who have persevered (about 80).  They still require some Â£300 to complete the work and it will be long ere they will be able to raise that if left to their own unaided efforts.
