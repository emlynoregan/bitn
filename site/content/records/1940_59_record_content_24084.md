Obituary.  Mr Henry Brandt of Burra was getting through a fence near the Pig and Whistle Ford on Tuesday morning, when he collapsed.  Help was quickly to hand, but he was pronounced dead on arrival at Burra Hospital.  He had recently spent about a fortnight in the hospital. Mr Brandt had worked for about 40 years in the Broken Hill Mines and retired only about three months ago after spending about three years working on the Morgan-Whyalla Pipeline.  [David Henry Brandt, born 5 March 1880, Kooringa; died 30 October 1945, Adelaide, residence Boolcoomatta Station.]
