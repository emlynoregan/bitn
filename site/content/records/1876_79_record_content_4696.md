Obituary & Inquest. On Wednesday before P. Lane JP an inquest was held on the death of Thomas Beckwith who had died that morning. Dr Robert Brummitt saw the deceased Sat. evening and he was suffering from shock, internal injuries and a broken rib. He requested Mr Gonne to send him down in the morning if the opportunity arose. He was sent down Sunday afternoon. In hearsay evidence Mr Cogan, the deceased’s employer, said Beckwith was going towards Hallett with an empty wagon. He sent a person on horseback to bring him back and deceased was found on the road with the wagon about a mile away. Beckwith, though partly conscious, said nothing about the accident. 
Joseph De La Hunty said the deceased had told him the bullocks attempted to run away and in trying to put on the skid he was knocked down and the wheel rolled over him. He had not been drinking. The same story had been told to his mother who, in evidence, complained about his treatment at the Willogoleech Hotel. 
Deceased would have been 17 on 14 October.  [Thomas Gabriel Beckwith born 8 October 1861 Hillside near Burra: died 2 September 1878 Burra, residence near Hallett.] 
The evidence of Elizabeth Cameron, nurse, confirmed the above. 
The inquest was then adjourned till Wednesday to get Mr Gonne’s evidence. Dr Brummitt was recalled and said he was satisfied about the state of the room at the hotel. Gonne’s evidence was compatible with the above. Verdict was accidental death.
