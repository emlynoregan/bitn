Firefighting Course

18 CFS personnel from the southern section of Region 4 came to Burra to attend a training course, including four new members of the Burra unit, on Saturday from 8.30 a.m. to 10 p.m. and from 8.30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday.  They were taken through instruction in basic rules and regulations, prevention of injury and the use of hand tools, and the response to wildfire, and hazardous materials and structure fires.  Burra CFS unit captain Chris Taylor said it was a very well attended course.  He also reported that Ian Kleinig, who had been injured in the Victorian Bushfires, had been flown to Adelaide on 4 March and was doing exceptionally well in recovering from his accident.
