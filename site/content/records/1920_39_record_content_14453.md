Burra Corporation Annual Meeting of Ratepayers.

There was a good attendance on Thursday evening last with Mr Radford in the chair.

Of £2,000 in rates only about £6 was owing.  The failure of streetlights in some places was due neither to the Council nor to the Electrical Co., but to the vandalism by some school children.  This year the Council had done little on main roads, but had reduced the Fire Brigade debt by £225.  (The Chairman thought that £100 of that would have been better spent on main roads.)  A fair percentage of the 1,000 trees planted had grown.  He thought it was better to plant 50 and look after them.  The Mayor’s report was adopted.

There was considerable discussion re the high rates, income from which had risen £1,000 in three years.  The Mayor said that due to inflation this sum was not buying anymore.  Government grants were also decreasing.

There was discussion and dissension re parking of cars around the rotunda in Market Square.

The town needed a new ambulance.  The old one was worn out in serving outlying areas that now refused to fund a replacement.  Cr Hammond favoured getting one for use only in the area of the Corporation.  Mr Kellock said that as a District Councillor he had turned down the request to contribute as the DC was stony broke.  Councillors favoured a Kooringa playground [To match the Redruth one] if a suitable place could be found.
