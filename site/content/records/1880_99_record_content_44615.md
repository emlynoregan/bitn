2nd Leader on the Strike by Employers.

In retaliation for the election of Mr McPherson in East Adelaide employers are reducing hands, and money for the development of certain legitimate enterprises is being refused because they say ‘we will do nothing to assist or to increase the number of those who vote against us at the polls.’

The writer regards this as both illogical and foolish as well as being damaging for the whole colony.
