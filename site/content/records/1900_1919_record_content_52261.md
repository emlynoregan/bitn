Burra Hospital Public Meeting Thursday 1 November.

The Institute was 75% full.  The Mayor took the chair and he with Crs Dane and McWaters were the only Hospital Board members present.

W.G. Hawkes wrote from Koonoona dated 31 October that he had an important prior engagement.  He thought the present management needed drastic alteration and was glad there was a meeting of the people.  ‘As matters stand at present, the once noble institution is a wreck and no other result could have been expected from the reckless and indecent quarrelling with the medical profession that has signalised the Board for some time past.’

Thomas B. Ashton wrote a long letter.

He considered the present situation bad for the town and those of moderate means, but that it would not have occurred had he been treated fairly.  He felt his presence could only lead to his adversaries accusing him of fomenting trouble.  This would not help while the Chief Secretary was considering the matter of his exclusion from the Hospital.  He was prepared, if asked, to explain any points arising.  He was being careful of what he said for fear of litigation.  He felt the Board had shown no genuine desire for information from the medical officers.

‘It is my duty to insist that patients in my care receive the treatment required as ordered . . . and I was not prepared to work in an institution which permits that principle to be invaded.’

‘I wrote for an explanation of the Board’s action in excluding me from the Hospital.  Mt letter was not acknowledged, and consequently I stayed away from the Hospital under protest, in writing and without prejudice, notifying the Board to this effect, until I have heard whether the Chief Secretary endorses their action or otherwise.’

On 11 August 1917 the Board appointed Dr Ashton honorary surgeon without any application from him, which he said ‘demonstrates that their action in excluding me from the Hospital was unwarranted and unjust’.  He points out that the patient, Mrs Morrison’s child, referred to last week in Mr McBride’s letter to the paper, was Dr Williams’ patient.

Mr G. Hann then moved for the resignation of the entire Board, their management not being in the best interests of the people and that they be replaced by an elected and representative Board.

He lists five reasons for this:

Large numbers of sick people, many not fit to travel, are seeking hospital treatment elsewhere.

Refusal of one doctor to work at the hospital under the present conditions.

Complaints re fees charged and the character of the accommodation.

Incomplete and unsatisfactory reports of Board meetings.

The Hospital is not keeping up its standard of a 20-bed hospital as registered in the Australian Trained Nurses Assoc.  Or even the minimum recognised 10-bed standard.

E.J. Davey 2nd – not he said as Town Clerk, but as a ratepayer and secretary of the Foresters’ Lodge.
