Masonic Lodge.  Kooringa Lodge No. 6 [Which had gone into recess in December 1886.] Attempts are being made to reactivate the lodge in Burra.  There is a credit balance in the bank and applications have been made by six gentlemen for membership, and an early opening is hoped for.

[This attempt presumably failed because the lodge remained closed till August 1899.]
