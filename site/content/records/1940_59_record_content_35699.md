Burra Town Council and The Question of Tennis Club Leases

The Mayor has received two similar legal opinions on the leasing of parklands to the Aberdeen and Kooringa Tennis Clubs by the Burra Town Council.  They reveal:

The Council can only give a lease for a period of 21 years to two persons representing a body such as a tennis club, and sanctioned by a meeting of ratepayers.  According to the Act of 1890.

Therefore the Council was out of order in granting a 99 year lease to the Aberdeen Tennis Club in 1923.

At best this lease was only valid till 1944.

Because the Council had continued to accept the licence fee of £1 per annum, the conditions now ruling would be valid until 6 September 1948.

The Kooringa Methodist Tennis Club lease should have been made in favour of the Trustees of the Church and not to the Church, which could not establish its rights if challenged.

It was suggested a temporary licence be issued to this body until June 1948.

Cr S.J. Woollacott said he would now give notice that he would move that a By-Law be framed prohibiting Sunday Sport on Parklands in Burra.

Cr Marston gave notice that he would move for a poll on the question.

The Mayor said all the Council could now do was to terminate the tenancy of the Aberdeen Tennis Club in September 1948 unless the Club entered into an agreement with the Council.

Crs T.H. and S.J. Woollacott both disputed the rights of the present Aberdeen Tennis Club, as being a different body from that of 1923.

The Mayor said the 1923 agreement was null and void but certain bodies had used the courts and the Council had accepted their fees and could not now put them off the courts, but merely give them notice that the tenancy would expire in September next.

Crs S.J. & T.H. Woollacott then moved that the Aberdeen Tennis Club be informed that its tenancy would expire in September, but the Council would be pleased to renew the tenancy provided the club agreed to certain conditions laid down by the Council.

Cr Marston said he would not support such a motion because by September there might be new men on the Council and the Mayor and six men had no right to decide whether the citizens of Burra should play sport on Sundays or not.  He would like to see a poll of ratepayers to decide the issue.  Cr S.J. Woollacott’s motion was a move to bludgeon or bully a body of people who had spent hundreds of pounds on improving Council lands, into doing something which that body of people did not want to do.

The motion was lost, with only Crs S.J. & T.H. Woollacott supporting it.
