ETSA.  The manager, Mr R.M. Lea, will visit Burra to inspect the locality and to discuss the possibility of linking Burra to the ETSA supply.  The heavy program of the Trust makes any immediate move unlikely.  Work is presently concentrated on completing the main supply lines between Pt Augusta and Adelaide.
