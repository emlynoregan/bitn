The Burra Community Internet & Computer Centre is now open and provides email and Internet access to the local community and visitors.  It is located in the Burra Town Hall and was established with a Commonwealth grant under the Networking the Nation Program.  The computers have large 19 inch monitors and high speed access.  The centre has a good software library, enabling users to do a wide range of things.  It opened last month and can also provide secretarial and business services when required.  It can also offer for hire a multimedia projector for special events.
