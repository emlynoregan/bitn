Burra Clothing Factory

It appears a clothing factory will shortly be opened in Burra and an appeal is being made for 25 girls aged over 14 to work in the factory which will probably be located in the SAFU building.  This is a direct result of the recent visit of Hon. N. Makin, Minister for Navy & Munitions & of Mr A.E. Smith MHR.  Wages will range from 20/- to 75/- depending on age and experience.  The factory is being sponsored by the Commonwealth Government in the interests of decentralisation.  Five or six factories have already been opened and the local one should begin within three weeks.
