Eastern Telephone Line

Last Wednesday Mr J.V. Lord of Oakvale Station required urgent medical assistance.  A phone call soon had Dr Steele heading out for the station 140 miles from Burra.  This private telephone line is a vital link for the eastern stations, with the potential to save lives.  It is thus very unfortunate that all too often people interfere with the line.  Sometime wires are cut to repair a car or other vehicle.  At other times the wires are tied down to fences.  One of the most difficult causes of interruptions to find occurs when the wires are tied tightly to insulators.  All such behaviour has the potential to place lives in danger.
