Editorial on The Moonta Mines

Early in the year miners wanted better working conditions including higher pay for surface hands who were then earning 4/6 a day.  (Nominally they were getting more, but it was reduced to this by intermittent contracts.)  Directors refused as the mine was said to be barely paying its way.  This led to a strike and work stopped, though they kept the pumps going.  The editor is concerned about collateral damage to SA and Moonta businesses: ‘strikes are a very barbarous method of dealing with trade and labour disputes’.
