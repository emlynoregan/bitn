Gold in Victoria

William Campbell writes from Strathloddon on 15 July.

[He reports the discovery of gold at the Loddon in the Pyrenees and says a few men are working at the Craig Ore, the name he has given the Pyrenees Diggings.  He sends some samples for testing.]

H. Walsh of Swanson Street reported the samples assayed at 24 carats fine, the finest gold he ever saw and worth on the London market 83/6 per ounce.

At a recent meeting of the Gold Committee Dr Bruhn produced a small package of quartz and marl.  The milk quartz specimens were found to contain gold in great abundance.
