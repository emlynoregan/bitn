Weather.  Rain for the week fell practically every day and for Burra totalled 205 points.  The Burra Creek ran strongly and deposited quite a load of rubbish at the Pig and Whistle Crossing.  The Young Street Ford was closed, but a car was caught in the water and came to rest against the concrete pillar of the old footbridge.  The occupants of the car climbed to the roof and awaited help.  Mr S. Irlam later towed it out of the creek.  Mr R. Sandercock’s garage took off in Saturday afternoon’s strong wind.  The wind lifted it neatly, leaving Mrs Sandercock’s car standing in the open without damage.

Other falls for the week included 226 points at Mt Bryan, 195 at Booborowie and 317 at Farrell Flat.
