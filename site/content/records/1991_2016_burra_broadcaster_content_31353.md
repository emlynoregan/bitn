Goyder Council.  There are plans to pave all the protuberances into the street in Burra, removing all plantings except for one tree in the centre.  In Market Square the plan would see the central island lawned around the War Memorial and paved to the north.  The crazy paving in front of the BankSA would be taken up and the area of lawn extended.
