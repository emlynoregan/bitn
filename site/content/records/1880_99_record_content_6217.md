Ratepayers’ Meeting, Institute, 2 February, to consider the proposed Council loan.

Cr Sampson moved approval and spoke to the necessity of each part of it.  A main point is that unless the loan is taken out the Council will lose some £950 in Government subsidy in the next two years.  The Town survey is needed to reduce the litigation on associated matters.  It would be foolish not to carry out the conditions imposed by SAMA in transferring the Recreation Ground.  Cr Ward 2nd.

Mr Bartholomæus moved an amendment negating the loan.  Mr Motley & Mr Killicoat supported the amendment and Mr West and Cr Geake supported the motion, as did Dr Brummitt and F.W. Holder.

Mr Haskard and Mr Cave were against the loan.  The motion was carried and a poll demanded.
