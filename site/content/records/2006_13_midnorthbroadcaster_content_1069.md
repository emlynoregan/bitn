David Barker, 6th generation of the Barkers of Baldina grew up on Baldina Station and then moved away for schooling and work.  He is thrilled to be back, setting up a new IT business.  He and his newly wedded wife Angela will front Regional ITAssist, offering hardware, consulting, service and support.  David completed a Certificate III in Information Technology at TAFE and then undertook a Diploma in Information Technology.

The Barker family has been in the district since 1839, when they bought the Burra Hotel.  In 1847 they donated it to the community and it became the Burra Hospital, while the family bought Baldina Station.

[These last two sentences are largely fiction.  Pastoral Pioneers of South Australia states that Alfred Barker arrived in SA on the brig Rapid along with Colonel Light 21 August 1836.  In 1841 he overlanded cattle from NSW and in the 1840s he was in partnership with W.G. Field in the Yankalilla area to the south of Adelaide.  Field died in 1852 and it was about then that the family came north.

The Burra Hotel operated from 1846 till 1876.   Alfred Barker was the licensee from 1852-58.  Ownership of the site would have resided with the SA Mining Association.  After running the Burra Hotel Alfred Barker purchased the lease on 33 square miles of country at Baldina from James Humphrey.  As far as the Burra hospital is concerned, when the Burra Hotel lease expired in 1876 the community negotiated the purchase of the freehold from the SA Mining Association for conversion of the building to a hospital and unusually for the Association it agreed to sell the freehold to the Burra Town Council.  Council approved payment in July 1877 of Â£583-10-8 including interest.
