Anzac Day was remembered at the War Memorial in Market Square when more than 50 people gathered for the service in bleak and threatening conditions, but though there had been rain throughout the night, the service was held in a welcome break.  Father Quinn from the Catholic Church officiated.  Wreaths were placed by the RSL, the Ladiesâ€™ Auxiliary, The Regional Council of Goyder, Burra Community School and the BBH Football Club.  Burra RSL President Len Simpson recited the Ode.
