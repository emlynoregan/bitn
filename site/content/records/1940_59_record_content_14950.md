Miss Irene Milligan, after an almost life-long residence, left Burra on Monday.  She came as a child to live with her aunt, the late Mrs John O’Leary.  On leaving school she became a music teacher.  Her only sister died recently and Miss Milligan has gone to stay at least for a time with relatives at Wallaroo Mines.  St Joseph’s loses a faithful member.
