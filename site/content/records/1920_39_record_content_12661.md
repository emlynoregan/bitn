Burra Children’s Playground.  When Mr T.W. Wilkinson was Mayor many trees were planted due to his interest and as a result what is now known as Lowe’s Park in Aberdeen was planted with pines.  Mr L.H. Foote conceived the idea that the site would make a good place for a playground.  After much work it was opened on Boxing Day.  Many turned up to celebrate and the place looked festive with flags and booths.  It was opened by the Mayor, Maurice Collins.  Mr Collins would have liked it better had it been nearer Kooringa, but there should be no feeling it belonged only to one end of the town.  Mr Crewes also spoke.  He also regretted that it was inconvenient for the southern end of town, but said that Kooringa would get one as well.  There were swings, seesaws, shelter sheds, parallel bars, horizontal bars, a rocker, giant stride.  Sand ponds are to come, as are some seats.  Various sports were run at the opening and afternoon tea was served.  The day raised c. £30 and the committee has c. £70 towards building a rotunda.

A successful continental was held in the grounds in the evening.
