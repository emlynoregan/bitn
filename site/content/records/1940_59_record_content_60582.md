Drought in the Eastern Plains is presenting owners with the question of whether to drove sheep out or use semi-trailers.  Trucked sheep arrive in much better condition at market and therefore get higher prices. Drovers find little water along the way and rely on private people to supply it and in some cases water has to be carted out for the travelling sheep.
