Editorial on the Burra Town Council

The town has of late been much improved and this has been effected by the expenditure of c. £1,000 p.a.  The rates are about £600 and the Government subsidy of c. £600 less the police payment of £140 leaving about £1,060.

Current expenses are paid from dog fees, licences, fines etc., which leaves the rates for public works, which attract Government subsidy.  This can never exceed the rates less the police payment.  The regret is that the early years saw a squandering of the rates and the triumph of party and private spleen, which ultimately deprived the town of c. £1,500 in subsidy.

At present there exists a bonded debt of £200 and a bank debt of £700-£800.  To pay this off would absorb over a year’s income and lose an equal amount of Government subsidy.  This repayment should be deferred until the Government subsidy ceases when repayment will not involve loss of income.  To do this the Corporation needs to issue bonds for £700-£800 repayable at say £200 p.a. commencing five years from the date of issue.

The Public Works Committee wishes to get desirable works done at once and have their convenience enjoyed.  This would be a heavy burden for future ratepayers if the works were of other than a permanent nature, or if maintenance of them was likely to be expensive, but this is not so.
