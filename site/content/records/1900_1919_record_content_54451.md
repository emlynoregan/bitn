Mr O’Halloran said the party was against property qualifications for the Legislative Council and was for that chamber’s abolition.  They were in favour of reducing the House of Assembly to seven electorates with three members each – a reduction of over 50%.  Farmers and labourers were not receiving true value for their labour.  There had been profiteering on kerosene in the war years.  The party believed in equal opportunity, education for all and equal wages for men and women.
