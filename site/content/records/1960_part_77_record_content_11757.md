Annual Catholic Ball at the Burra Town Hall on Friday drew a fair crowd.  The sumptuous supper followed a somewhat unenjoyable period on the dance floor.  The general view was that the band lost all sense of time and beat and was merely loud and blaring.  While the band had supper Miss Shirley Ryan on the piano and a drummer provided a more satisfactory accompaniment for several dances.  Door takings were about Â£63.
