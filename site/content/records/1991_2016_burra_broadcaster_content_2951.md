Burr Burra DC

Redbanks remains closed to the public despite reports to the contrary in the Adelaide press.

Skeleton weed is a problem in the area.

Road trains using Council roads are of concern; they are making illegal used of roads south of the saleyards.

Council resolved to retain seven Councillors with no wards in the district.

Mrs A. Gilman will plant a tree adjacent to the Burra Creek in memory of the late Mrs Marlene Burton.

Council will consider the cost of a car park adjacent to the Bon Accord Hotel.

The swimming pool is progressing well.
