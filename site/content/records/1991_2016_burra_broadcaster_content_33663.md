Burra Community Development Program Inc. (BCDP) was established in June 2000 following a special meeting of Main Street, as a new committee to manage a Working Towns Project, to prepare a report for the Goyder Council with recommendations for a management structure for the Burra Town Hall.  Council handed the management of the hall to the BCDP in October 2001.  At the November 2003 AGM there was insufficient interest to fill the vacant committee positions.  At present the BCDP and its sub-committees are in abeyance.  If the committee cannot fill its positions the BCDP will fold and the Town Hall and its Telecentre will close its doors to the community.  The hard work has been done.  Much renovation has been accomplished at the hall and monies have been raised.  A public meeting at the Town Hall on 13 May at 6.30 p.m. will decide the future of the BCDP.
