Rangelands Junior Youth Environment Forum has resulted in local students from BCS, Farrell Flat Primary, Robertstown Primary and St John’s Lutheran Eudunda schools participating in a revegetation project at the Burra Creek Gorge.  400 plants were planted by a group of 16 students with assistance from Rangelands NRM officer Andy Nicholls and Andrew Allanson and Janet Keyes from Irongrass Environmental Rehabilitation Services.  The World’s End Biodiversity Project is an important effort in establishing a biodiversity corridor for the protection of flora and fauna along the Burra Creek Catchment.  Students also dipped nets to find and identify macro invertebrates in the water and tested the water quality in the creek.  The forum is held once a term for students of years 5-7.
