Stan Kellaway writes re a recent Burra Football Assoc. meeting at which Spalding objected to S. Kellaway Jnr as an umpire on the grounds of inconsistency.  In addition Hallett delegates had been instructed to vote against him as central umpire.  Mr Kellaway says he rose to object, not as a father, but as a delegate and member of the Umpire Committee.  He said Hallett had condemned S. Kellaway Jnr before he had even bounced a ball in the first match and this they had not denied.  Furthermore any complaint should have gone to the Umpire Committee.  Since the resolution to appoint more umpires was passed, the meeting clearly over-rode the Umpire Committee, which he therefore regards as defunct.  He therefore submits his resignation from the committee.
