Fire.  At 4.30 a.m. on 24 October the alarm was raised of a fire at the shop of R.A. Lewis, cycle and phonograph dealer, next to Jeffery & Byrnes butchers.  The front of the premises was well alight, but was soon put out by the Fire Brigade.  The origin is a mystery.  Residents returning well after midnight from a Masonic function at Spalding had noticed nothing.  Joe Byrnes who was sleeping on the adjacent premises was awakened by the crackling of the fire and raised the alarm.  The building is one of the oldest in Burra and is owned by S. Jeffery of Aberdeen.  All the stock was consumed and is only partly covered by insurance.
