The building has been renovated and is beautifully clean inside and out.  Proceedings inside took the form of a musical program.  Mr J.G. Sara said the repairs had been badly needed.  It was at the Copperhouse Church he had preached his first sermon as a local preacher.  Rev. Alvey said he had looked on the building with pity and shame since coming to the circuit.  The opportunity to do something came when the old Primitive Methodist Church property was purchased by the Government for a State School and he told the Trust they must contribute something towards the renovation fund.  They had given £25.  The contract for rough-casting and pointing the exterior etc. was £28 and with new windows and other work the total was over £82.  The Copperhouse Sunday School contributed £8.  Mrs T.H. Woollacott, Mr H.W. Tiver and a friend put in £5 each and Mr Robert Fuss £4.  Mrs J.C. Sandland (an old resident) £1-1-0 and Miss Nosworthy £1.  Nell Byles who had attended Sunday school there had offered herself for mission work in New Britain and had passed her nursing exams.  Alan Lomman, a lad in the Sunday school had calsomined and painted the interior.  The men who erected the belfry were thanked also and E.W. Dunhill for making and placing the big gate.  The day raised enough money to write off the liabilities.

The following are named as workers on the project: Mesdames J. Nickles, H. & A. Lomman, W. Kellaway, J. Coon, W. Ford, W. Symonds, R. Appleton, T.S. Robins and Messrs E. Pryor, I. Kellaway & R. Voumard.
