Morphett’s Pump House Renovation

The committee established by the Burra Burra DC last year has been working towards the renovation of the Morphett’s Pump House and Winding House.  National Trust architect Mr Ealing visited and advised on the necessary stages of the restoration.

A grant of $15,000 has enabled the District Council to buy scaffolding and slate for the re-roofing.  The committee has recommended a further request be made for $25,000 for restoration.  Australia’s large mining companies will be approached for donations to assist with the restoration of mining relics.
