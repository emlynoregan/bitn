[William Pearce brought scorn and derision on his head when at the Literary Soc. meeting he used the word ‘Rabble’ to describe those attending the burning of Kruger in effigy.  This was so unpatriotic that he had to write to the Record to explain that he had not intended this to apply to all those present, but only to a certain segment.  He had, he said, ‘put his signature to the requisition presented to the Council and otherwise helped in a small way.’]
