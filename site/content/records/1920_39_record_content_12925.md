Football.  The Aberdeen Football Club met Thursday.  The previous season was the worst in its history.  It had lost the services through departure of Norman Fuss, Sid Ween, Bill Hanson, Don Fuss, Eddie Cox, Scobie Jones & Vic. Pearce.  The financial position is satisfactory.  The Association has debited the club with 19/10, but as 15/- was for programs which were never received the club accepts a debt for 4/10 only.  Elections: Patron, James Reed; President, J.H. Gallagher; Captain, Bert Jones; Vice-Captain, F. Bernhardt.
