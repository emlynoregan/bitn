BCS.  Staff Profile: Cathy Correll

I am the Home Economics teacher with some Primary PE and Science.  My home was Port Clinton on the Yorke Peninsula before studying in Adelaide.  My first teaching appointment was at Kimba Area School for three years.  Last Year I had a yearâ€™s leave and worked with a horticultural business in Denmark, growing vegetable seedlings and pot plants under glass.  There was also time for travelling.  In Burra I have begun to play basketball and have enrolled to learn to play golf.
