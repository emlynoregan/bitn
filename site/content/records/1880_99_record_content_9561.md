Larrikinism.  On Sunday 25 Feb. Arthur Hudson, Alfred Hunt, William Lawn & Alexander Ross knocked on the door of Mrs Jackaâ€™s boarding house in Thames St in the early hours asking for lodging.  When she found they were locals living in Kooringa an altercation began in which Lawn tried to strike Thomas Hall, [Halls?] one of the boarders.  Two of the boarders received blows and Hall knocked Ross down into the gutter.  Convicted of knocking on the door without lawful excuse Ross & Lawn were fined 15/- each.  Hunt & Hudson 5/- each.  All were + costs which are unclearly printed, but seem to be 14/3 each.
