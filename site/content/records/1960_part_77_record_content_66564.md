Barkers of Baldina Aged Cottage Homes were opened by Miss Priscilla Brown, step-daughter of the late J.R. Barker.  Mr R.B. Jennison, Vice Chairman of the Board of Management, welcomed those present.  The Chairman of the District Council Mr Roy Jeffery addressed the meeting.  The late John Robert Barker had taken over the running of ‘Baldina’ on the completion of his education [and had bequeathed the bulk of the funds that enabled the construction of the cottages].  Mr Max Gilgen, Assistant Director of Social Security in SA, also spoke, welcoming this addition to the services to the Burra Community.  He spoke on the role of the Department and the various types of accommodation it helps to fund.  The Commonwealth granted $47,600, which represented the maximum available for the project.  Mr Ron Pearse, Chairman of the Board of Management, outlined Mr Barker’s wishes in planning the cottages.  There is sufficient money in hand to level a site for a further nine units, which will be built as soon as finance allows.  Miss Brown then gave a short address expressing her satisfaction with the building and furnishing of the homes, before declaring them open.  [Photograph of J.R. Barker.]
