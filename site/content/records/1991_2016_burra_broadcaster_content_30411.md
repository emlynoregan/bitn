Burra Community Library is sponsoring a literary competition to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the opening of BCS.  The theme is ‘When I Lived in Burra’.  There are three age sections for students and an adult section.  [Note that in Issue 591, 5 March 2003, page 2 the theme is importantly corrected to ‘When I lived in Burra in 1877’.]
