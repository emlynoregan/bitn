Burra Co. Volunteer Forces.

Owing to the disbanding of the Company members are asked to return rifles and accoutrements at once to Captain Butterworth or Mr Pederson so a final settlement of its affairs can be made.  A final meeting to settle company business is called for Thursday night at the Institute.

It is intended to hold a social prior to the disbandment of the company on Wednesday 16 September at the Commercial Hotel.  Members of the Mounted Infantry will be invited.  Disbandment follows the reduction in numbers due to transfers to the Mounted Infantry Company.
