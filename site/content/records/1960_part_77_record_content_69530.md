Burra High School Presentation Day (December 1973)

Mr John Halbert, Senior Lecturer in Physical Education at Adelaide Teachers’ College was the guest speaker.

Headmaster D.W. Calder presented the 61st Annual Report.

The year began with 175 students; 100 girls and 75 boys.  In Leaving there were 20 girls and 3 boys.  The prefects have set a fine example and have been conscientious in their duties.  Parent bodies have been co-operative and helpful in enabling the purchase of many sporting and classroom items.  The school canteen proved a great success.  The High School Council has been concerned at the high rate of staff turnover each year; over 50%, and it ahs sought more stability.  It has also been concerned over the standard of school accommodation and the progress of the new school.

St Peter’s Cathedral Choir is coming to Burra again for their annual holiday.  They came three years ago.  They will camp at the Redruth Methodist Memorial Hall, but need three more beds, 12 mattresses and 29 pillows.  If you can help, contact Mr R.R. Reed as soon as possible.  The Choir will lead the singing at St Mary’s for a Confirmation and Holy Communion Service on 27 January, when the Bishop of Willochra, Rt Rev. Bruce Rosier will officiate.

Burra Carols Evening at the Burra Swimming Pool the Sunday before Christmas was the best for years.  Attendance and proceeds were up.  ($67 compared with c. $50 for several years.)  Burra Methodist Choir led the singing.

Burra Rainfall totalled 2,434 point for 1973, which is 670 points above the average.  From 1 January 1974 measurements will be in millimetres (mm).
