Historic Unveiling of the First Kooringa Cemetery

Yesterday morning a small group of people gathered for the unveiling of the newly restored original Kooringa Cemetery.  This is located at the end of Chapel Street and has long been hidden from most people’s knowledge except for history buffs and researchers.  A meeting about three years ago it was decided to see the site restored.  Roger and Jenny Cross undertook extensive research to uncover its history and there was a degree of heavier work in shifting rocks, laying pathways and clearing weeds.

In the process items from the original site that were washed into Burra Creek by wild floods in the 1850s were recovered, including part of a wooden cross that features in the construction of the shelter.

Jenny Cross discovered that the cemetery is possibly home to more than 150 graves, the majority being children and infants.

Of particular interest is the grave of Thomas Pickett, the discoverer of the Burra Mine, who died in 1851 and also rests in the First Kooringa Cemetery.

At the time of his death Pickett was no afforded a decent funeral by the SA Mining Association, but rather through the efforts of the licensee of the Miners’ Arms Hotel (now the Burra Hotel).  He was reimbursed the following month by the Association.

The site contains several graves all facing west, with pathways to Pickett’s grave and also a memorial stone in recognition of the workers, workers’ wives and children who were not recognised by the Mining Association.

The three information boards contain a brief history of the old and new cemeteries and a list of the names of those buried at the first cemetery.

Jenny Cross gave an informative address.  She touched on the lives of the people who created the town and in particular referred to Henry Ayers, Kingston who designed some of its cottages and Mortlock who made much money from the mine and started life as publican in the Burra Hotel.  Of course the people who really made Burra were the workforce; those who laboured for the Mining Association and suffered on behalf of the Monster Mine.  Research shows that from 1845 to about 1850 at least 150 people died.  It is likely that most if not all of them are buried here.  The memorial headstone is in recognition of these people who have no recognition other than this.

Goyder Council CEO John Brak had the honour of unveiling the shelter with the story boards.  The first Kooringa Cemetery is open to the public and it is hoped it will soon be included on the Burra Heritage Passport Trail.  [4 Photos]

[A number of the statements above that are framed in a quite positive format should be stated rather more tentatively.  They rest on information that is suggestive rather than conclusive.

It would be difficult to place a date on which floods swept items into the Burra Creek.

The list of those possibly interred in the cemetery is quite sensibly derived from registration of deaths records.  For this period those records do not record the place of death.  They are records for ‘The District of the Murray’, which covered a large area of the north and east of SA.  Kooringa was the only large settlement and so it is reasonable to conclude that the vast majority of those deaths occurred there and that the burials were in this cemetery.
