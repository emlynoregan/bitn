Burra Hospital Board, last Thursday

Mr Warnes on behalf of a committee said that both the Chief Secretary and the Inspector General of hospitals required a decision on whether the hospital was to be a Subsidised Hospital or a Government Charitable Hospital.  If the former then the Corporation [Town Council] and the surrounding area [the District Councils] would need to raise â…” of the cost.  If the latter the Government would find all the money, but the hospital would then treat only charity cases.  The Inspector General thought it had to be a Subsidised Hospital.  Mr Warnes agreed and he so moved.  Seconded by Mr Wheare.

Mr Crewes favoured postponing a decision for a full board, but others said the matter had been around for a long time and other members had plenty of notice to attend.  The motion passed unanimously.
