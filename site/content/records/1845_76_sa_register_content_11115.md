‘A Traveller by the Clare Mail’ writes after the publication of the returns on land sales and road expenditure.  He recommends that at least one member of the Central Road Board takes a seat in the Clare mail.  They might then question the ‘perfectly significant’ sums expended on the line of road travelled by that mail.
