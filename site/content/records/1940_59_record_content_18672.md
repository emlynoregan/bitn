Burra Institute

The State Bank has agreed to allow the Council to pay off any money owing on the Institute at any time if the Council purchases the building.  Council is now able to apply to the Minister for permission to purchase the building.  It was a good opportunity to act, as interest rates were sure to rise once hostilities cease.

Burra Red Cross & FFCF Ball was held in the Institute on Friday and the gross proceeds were c. Â£40.  Dancing continued to 2 a.m.
