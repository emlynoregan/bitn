Messrs Freer & Scott recently applied to Council for permission to operate a bus service in Burra in competition with Mr R.A. Bevan.  They would use a Diamond T bus and as well as meeting trains would run two trips a day for business people between Burra and Burra North and would cater for functions at the Burra Town Hall.  The Mayor sought to delay consideration, saying there was no hurry as the firm needed to get permission from the Railways Commissioner and the Liquid Fuel Control Board.  The Mayor was afraid that there was too little profit in the town for two services and he did not want to see a big fellow swallow a little fellow.  Cr Jennison said the Council should be careful of being accused of fostering a monopoly.
