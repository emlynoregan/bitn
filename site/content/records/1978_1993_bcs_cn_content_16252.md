Member of Burra Branch of the National Trust

Attended Copper Festival Meetings

Member of the Burra & District Crippled Childrenâ€™s Auxiliary

Part time teacher at BCS

I am anxious to support the retention of full services at the Burra Hospital and to see better day care facilities and aged hostel accommodation.  I believe Council should support local business and industry and make efficient use of Council plant, staff and services.  I would seek the regular promotion of Council matters to the community and favour the development of the tourist industry.
