Burra & District Ambulance Meeting, 26 May

The committee appointed on 1 June 1920 solicited public subscriptions and raised £345-9-5 and had a garage built at a cost of £66.  This was possible through Mr J.H. Gallagher donating stone from the old Bible Christian Chapel.  John Reed and his helpers took down the stone and transported it.  The Town Council also provided transport.  T.H. Woollacott Jnr contracted for the building with F.M. Pearce doing the carpentry – this work being done at cost price.  The committee is now in the position to hand over the ambulance as a going concern to the Town Council.  £345-9-5 was raised by subscription and £25-3-0 by hire of the ambulance.  Expenses totalled £360-9-4 leaving a credit of £10-3-1.  The meeting approved handing the ambulance to the Town Council and appointed a deputation to attend to it.
