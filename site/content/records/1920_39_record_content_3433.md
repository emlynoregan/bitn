Weather.  In the past week there has been heat with thunderstorms and rain.  At Booborowie on Wednesday over 2” fell in 30 minutes doing much damage to fences, feed etc.  Messrs Hawker, Tohl, Murray & Hawkes were worst hit.  The same weather prevailed out east with some heavy falls.  Since 22 February Glenora has registered 4.05” and 8.92” since 27 December.  At Thistlebeds Alick Kellock recorded over 3” since 16 February and 1.35” least Thursday alone.  Feed is abundant.  Generally rain out east has varied from 2.7” at ‘The Gums’ to 5.7” at Glenora for the last week.    [Note this would appear to contradict the 4.05” cited in the same report!]
