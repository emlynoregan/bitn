Letter.  Mij Tanith writes to say that the unsatisfactory result of the playwriting project was a result of community apathy and not lack of skill or experience on her part.  She fulfilled her contract by conducting a series of workshops aimed at teaching playwriting skills to community members.  Her fee was nowhere near the $11,000 cited in the newspaper article.  She was paid $1,400 in cash and $600 for accommodation.  She felt the facts had been grossly mishandled.
