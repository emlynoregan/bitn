Burra Burra DC, 2 August

Repairs to slate footpaths in Market Square are to be made.

The Overseer reported that costs to repair the old [Jubilee Avenue] drinking fountain would be over $100.  Consideration was deferred.

Aberdeen Tennis Club was given permission to erect pillars as agreed with Burra Town Councillors.

[Erected at the entrance to Burra North Playground with plaques to honor the service of Sid and Flo Scroop to the club.  See 94, 11, 28 Mar. 1972, page 1.]
