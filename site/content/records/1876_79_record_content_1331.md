Sanitation in Kooringa: Report of libel case arising out of the debate reported earlier.

Nesbitt v. Cave for damages of Â£2,000.

In July the rev, H. Howitt of St Mary's Kooringa preached a sermon on the text than cleanliness is next to godliness in which he referred to the poor state of sanitation of Paxton Square houses and the apathy of SAMA to the state of dwellings and the comfort of the inhabitants. A summary appeared in the Northern Mail and a warm discussion followed. Mine officials challenged the truth of the sermon statements. Taking part were the Govt. Medical Officer at Kooringa and the defendant who is a doctor in the same town and a mine doctor. Cave made a report to the mine officials denying the plaintiff's assertion that a recent typhoid outbreak had arisen on the property of SAMA. Nesbitt then wrote another letter in which he said that Cave's arguments were as reliable as his friendship and his statements would receive as much attention from the Central Board of Health as Captain Sander's statements had received.

Cave then published a rejoinder in which he said it was impossible for anyone to be long friends with Nesbitt who had manufactured the epidemic by sending his (i.e. Nesbitt's) groom's wife, while suffering from typhoid fever, to lodge at a house in Paxton's Square and she had caught the fever owing to Nesbitt's having allowed filth to accumulate at the back of his house and he knew so little of the symptoms of the disease that he had to be told what the woman was suffering from.

The judge ruled that unless it could be shown that any of the statements were false to the defendant's knowledge, the case would be decided by reference to Laughton v. the Bishop of Soder and Man and would not go to jury. The plaintiff's evidence was ruled largely inadmissible as proof of malice. Henry Pether, proprietor of the Northern Mail, was called with the original letter that started the case and showed that the original had been toned down somewhat before being published. Despite protracted legal argument on both sides it was ruled that it was a nonsuit.
