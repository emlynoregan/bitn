The Learn to Swim Campaign in Burra is currently under way.

BCS Speech Day had the first BCS Principal Mr Chris McCabe return as speaker.

The Chairman of the School Council Tony Baker commended the various committees and spoke of the last decadeâ€™s changes in the school.  In 1976 a Class 1A Principal was installed.

President of the SRC David Bailey said the highlights of the year had been the visit by the Language Centre and SRC involvement in the Vice-Regal Ball.  Members had learned meeting procedures and the SRC had sponsored tracksuits and donated funds for the restoration of two historic photos.

Principal Roger Henderson in his final report after five years at BCS said the past year had seen the school heavily involved in Jubilee 150 events.  The local history room mezzanine floor had been installed as a joint venture between the Library Board, the Education department and the District Council.  Peace Day had been celebrated on 11 November.  The students had produced Man of Steel.  A study room had been created for Year 12 students.  There had been a high degree of parent involvement.
