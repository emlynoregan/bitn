Redfire Resources have identified four sites near Burra for closer scrutiny.  One is 3-4 km north on the east side of the highway, another 6 km north to the west side of the highway.  Some 6 km northeast is an interesting circular magnetic signature and Mongolata is the fourth area of interest.

Burra Tourism Association will be re-instigated following a push by Alan Botting, manager of the Burra Visitor Centre.  A meeting to do this has been called for the Old Courthouse on 28 August.
