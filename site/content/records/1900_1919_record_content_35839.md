Burra Town Council, Monday.

The Hydraulic Engineer advises that the capital cost of the Burra Waterworks was £10,750 and revenue for the year ending 30 June was £1,145, producing a nett return of 3.2%.

The visit of the American Boys raised £11-9-0 for charities.  An invalid chair will be bought for the hospital and the balance will be sent to Minda Home.

Two boys have been seen pulling up recently planted street trees.  The cost of replacement has been estimated at 10/- and the boys’ parents will be asked to pay, or legal proceedings will be taken.

The Railways Department will be asked when it is intended to place the bell at the Bon Accord crossing.

District MPs are to be asked if there is any truth in the statement that from November the Broken Hill express will not stop at Burra.

Cr Parks moved that the motion confining the electric lighting scheme to East & West Wards be rescinded.  Cr Wicklein 2nd.  Carried.
