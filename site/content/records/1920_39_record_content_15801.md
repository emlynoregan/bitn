Burra Show Society.  On Saturday the President entertained 300 at luncheon in what was billed as the Jubilee Banquet, though the actual date of the founding of the society is something of a mystery.  The only drawback to the sumptuous spread was the very cold weather.  The Hon. W.G. Duncan proposed the ‘Burra Burra Show’ as a member of the Burra Society and the Royal Society – though as he said there were some who said the society was 48 years old and other said 52.*

Mr Crewes spoke next in praise of the president, a topic introduced by Mr Duncan.

Hon. W.G.J. Mills MLC proposed Burra & District and was supported by Hon. A.P. Blesing MLC.

The Mayor, Maurice Collins, responded.  In doing so he rehearsed some of the history of the mine from its discovery on 19 May 1845.

At first copper was carried by bullock dray to Adelaide and thence to England.  From 1848-51 900-1,000 men were employed before the Victorian gold rushes halted the mine.  Soon the miners drifted back and numbers gradually grew again until in 1859 1,170 men were employed and it continued thus till 1877 when the mine closed. † For many years the output of ore averaged 10,000 to 13,000 tons of 22% -24% copper.  In 29½ years of operation £2,241,224 was spent in wages and expenses.  234, 648 tons of ore were raised which paid dividends of £800,000 or £315 for every £5 invested in shares.

After 1877 with the mine closure the outlook for the district was bad and stayed so till the advent of superphosphate.  He (the Mayor) was practically a Burra boy having been born at Mt Bryan.  From Burra station £40,000 of wheat was sent away and that from a radius of about 9 miles.  5,000 bales of wool were also despatched.

Dr Steele supported the Mayor as RSL President.
