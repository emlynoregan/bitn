Burra Swimming Pool

The Mayor reported that he, with Messrs Dane & Harris, had inspected the pools at Jamestown and Georgetown and they had been impressed by both.  Costs had kindly been supplied.  One aspect was that the outlet from the pool would sustain regular irrigation along the creek and the production of prolific growth.  Mr S.J. Woollacott had offered the use of his tractor for three days (except for the cost of the driver and kero).  This, along with the promises of cement, led the Mayor to believe they could confidently start work.  One gentleman had suggested issuing debentures.  The Mayor thought a pool would become a paying proposition – as at Jamestown and Georgetown.

Cr Dow thought the time had arrived for a decision and he moved that the Mayor draw up plans and specifications.  Carried.

It was resolved that the Hydraulic Engineer be asked about the cost of water.

Crs Jennison and Kellaway were firmly behind the scheme.

The Mayor drew attention to the dangerous state of the road at the Mine Bridge.  He thought the turn at the south end was dangerous and the bridge was too narrow to accommodate both a big lorry and a car.  It needed widening.  He thought that could be done for £50-£70.  The Town Clerk suggested an approach to the Highways and Local Government Department and ‘suggested the widening of the bridge out of the footbridge alongside, a distance of approximately eight feet.’  It was resolved to ask the Department for a grant of £75.

It was also resolved to buy 500 trees, two years old in pots, for £21.
