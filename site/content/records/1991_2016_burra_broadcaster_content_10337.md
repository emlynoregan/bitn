Council Amalgamations

Hallett, Burra Burra, Robertstown and Eudunda DCs have signed a memorandum of understanding to investigate and report on likely gains from their merger.  Ratepayers in the northern region of Hallett Council would prefer to merge with Peterborough, but the Corporation of Peterborough has indicated it does not want to merge with Hallett ‘Wholly or in part’.  Any merging of Councils would involve consolidation of human and material resources and the rationalisation of boundaries, with consequent boundary adjustments.
