Burra Town Council

Council believes the solution to the road problem at Aberdeen is to open a continuation of Mill St through the Government Reserve.

Mr Powell of Clare has agreed to give the Corporation the block of land at Hampton through which it was desired to make a road.

SAMA has granted permission for the creek now occupying Chapel St to be diverted onto their allotment.

The Burra Conversazione is reported in 1 column.  It ran for a week.  [The report seems to imply that the telephones were operated between Burra and Clare - presumably making use of the telegraph lines.]
