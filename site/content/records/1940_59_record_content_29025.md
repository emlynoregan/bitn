‘The Man Who Sees’ writes re the proposed weir on the Burra creek.  He writes in the belief that no one seems to know about how such impounded water would behave, or what silt and rubbish would accumulate or whether the water would be suitable for swimming or what effect the water would have on the high banks.  No one had suggested how the water would be kept clean or what provision would be made for adults and juniors.

‘…a swimming pool is necessary, but to place a weir across a stagnant sewage basin does not appear to be the place to form one.’

He goes on to urge that public money not be expended on such folly and if there are people who think it viable then let them raise the funds needed without any liability to the community.  If the plan is to proceed the advice and services of a Town Planner and Consultant Engineer should be engaged and the decisions left to them.
