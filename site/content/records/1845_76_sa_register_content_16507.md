The work repairing the main road through the town has commenced and will need to be accomplished rapidly to be completed before winter sets in.  I am given to understand that the whole road will now be repaired, without the hiatus I have recently complained of.  If so, this is a welcome indication that the Road Board is willing to listen to reason.
