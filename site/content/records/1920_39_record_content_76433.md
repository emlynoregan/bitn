M.W. Bednall as Chairman of the Civil Defence Committee writes calling for volunteers for men to act as air raid wardens, stretcher bearers, fire fighters, transport officers etc.  As younger men will be needed by the military, preference for the above will be given to those over 45.  Women have enthusiastically been joining the VSD & Red Cross.  Lads 13-17 can be used as messengers.  Offers of transport are also needed.
