Burra Hospital

The Mayor has achieved an ex officio place on the Board which Council deemed justified since the Hospital is vested in the Council.

[The accounts are then printed.]

The General account was in credit £1-10-1.

North Ward had a debt of £24-15-2.

East Ward had a debt of £0-8-7.

West Ward was in credit £4-0-10.

Rate income for the wards is fairly even with the north a little lower:

North £139-1-9

East £147-19-0
