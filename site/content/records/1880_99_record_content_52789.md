The Mann Court Case.  There was ¾ column on this in the editorial column and then another ¾ column summary here before almost 2 columns of the actual court report.  This was considerable overkill for the event.

J.G. Mann sued the SAR Commissioners for £400 damages.  He alleged neglect and unskilful driving of the train on 8 July 1893 in that he was struck by the train when his horse and cart were at a level crossing.  He was thrown out and permanently injured.

Andrew Przibilla of Hanson:

Described how between 7 & 8 o’clock he had just got across the line when the train struck the horse of Mann’s cart and killed it, throwing Mann under the culvert.  He valued the horse and harness at £20.  He had not heard any whistle.  He was wearing a cap with flaps (though they were not over his ears) and is near-sighted and the wind was blowing against the train.  He swore he had looked up and down the line before crossing.

J.G. Mann:

Said he knew the crossing and approached it slowly.  He saw Przibilla signal him to stop, but by then it was too late.  He was put in the brake van after the accident and taken to Burra Hospital where he spent 19 days.  The cost of the hospital was £2-17-0 and of Dr Brummitt £6-10-0.  He has since been unable to work fully and has had to hire a man at £1-5-0 a week and lost the £25 profit from a crop he was unable to plant.  He valued his horse and harness at £35.  He did not hear a whistle.  The driver should have seen them on the road.  He estimated his damage at £300.

In cross examination he got rather tangled up about just when he looked for the train first and when he looked later.

Dr Brummitt gave evidence of severe bruising of the ribcage and shoulders and of small scalp wounds.

Harriet Camp and Edward Finch from the crossing site did not hear a whistle, but Finch could not swear it had not blown as trains came so constantly.

The Crown Solicitor asked for a non-suit on the grounds of failure to establish negligence.

Mr Gall, for Mann, said the evidence did show that the driver should have seen the two carts and if attentive could have prevented the accident; it was certainly, he said, a matter for the jury and not for the judge to dismiss.

The Driver:

Swore he blew the whistle at 600 yards.  He thought the two were continuing on parallel to the line as the road does that, but when he saw they were going to cross he blew again at 80 yards and braked hard.  The train was doing 25-30 m.p.h. and pulled up in 200 yards.

Others on the train verified his statement about the whistles.

The resident engineer gave evidence that the embankment there is only about 6’ high and a person on a cart could see a train coming for a mile or more.

The jury took 15 minutes to find for the defendants and Mann ended up having to pay the costs of both parties.
