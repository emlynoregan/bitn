Characteristics of the paper in 1920

Page 1

Large advertisements, mostly local.

Page 2

Mixture of large and smaller local advertisements; sales notices, public notices (especial about local activities) and local government notices.  The news generally begins on page 2, but in varying amounts: generally less than two columns.

Page 3

Local news in considerable detail fills most of this page and usually begins on page 2.  A few large local advertisements.  There is often a ‘Sun-Raysed Column’ with items of interest from anywhere in the world.

Page 4.

News in fluctuating amounts and some advertisements both large and small and sometimes humorous and general interest articles from elsewhere that are largely padding.  Advertisements include local businesses and patent medicines.

In general the paper contained a great deal of local news and was a good record of the life of the town for the period.
