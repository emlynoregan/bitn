Cr Rabbich thanked the meeting.  There was no need to go into the matter as it had been thoroughly aired in the Record.  He regretted that it had been necessary to call such a meeting.  He quite believed the Mayor had made an honest mistake in reading the first tender, but as no word had been said about accepting other than the lowest tender he felt it his duty to care for public funds by accepting the lowest tender.

W.H. Linkson proposed that: ‘The action of the Town Council in calling upon Councillor Rabbich for an apology, and in the event of his refusing, to fine him £10 and preventing him from taking his seat is unwarranted and derogatory to the best interests of the town.’  He understood Cr Rabbich had left the room when there was no motion before the chair.  Why were they so bitter against Cr Rabbich?

He hoped the Councillor would neither apologise nor pay the fine and would go to the next Council meeting and take his seat as the representative for North Ward.

Mr Fuss 2nd and agreed with Cr Rabbich’s action.  Mr Barrett thought the Council’s action arbitrary and in a vindictive spirit.  Motion carried.

Mr Whittick proposed ‘That the Town Council be requested to rescind the objectionable resolution affecting Cr Rabbich.’  There was nothing to give offence in Cr Rabbich’s explanation.  Mr Carmody 2nd.  Carried.

Mr Pinch proposed Messrs B. Butterworth, W. Killicoat, J. Tiver and the mover and seconder wait upon the Town Council at the next meeting and convey to them the resolutions passed at this meeting.’  2nd Mr Rawlings and carried.

Mr Neville proposed: ‘In the event of the Town Council failing to comply with the wishes of the meeting as evidenced in the foregoing resolutions the Mayor be requested to call a general meeting of ratepayers to consider their action.’  He considered the way Cr Sampson carried on a disgrace to the town.  2nd Mr Preece.

Burra Town Council, 16 March.

After the reading of the minutes Cr Sampson asked, as Cr Rabbich had taken his seat, if he intended to apologise or pay the fine.

Cr Rabbich said he intended to do neither.
