BCS students saw a demonstration of shearing by the Bioclip method on Friday, by Farrell Flat farming and livestock contractor, Adrian Cook.  This method sees the injection of a naturally occurring protein between the hind legs, which encourages a break in the wool follicles.  The sheep are covered with a body-hugging nylon net to contain the wool. After 28 days the net is pulled off, along with the fleece, to reveal a perfectly shorn sheep.  The lambs are a lot less stressed and no special treatment is needed afterwards.  The method is both cost and labour efficient.  If grower and buyer have settled on clip parameters and price, the wool can be baled while still in the nets and sent to the processor.  A number of farmers locally have begun to use the Bioclip method.
