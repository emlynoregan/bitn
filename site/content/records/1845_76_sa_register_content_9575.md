Christmas at Kooringa

On Wednesday some wrestling took place at the Miners’ Arms.

On Monday a fine bullock was killed and dressed by Messrs Stevens and M. Watts and roasted whole near the Burra Burra Hotel.  Several fine slices were cut from it about noon and by 6 p.m. it was considerably diminished.  Mr J. Pearce then collected together about 40 natives, who gave three hearty cheers for Queen Victoria, three more for Prince Albert and then three for the Royal Family.  Mr Pearce then helped them to the remainder of the bullock and in a short time nothing but bones remained.

Several foot races were held between men, boys, girls and blackfellows.  The usual enjoyments of jingling*, jumping in sacks etc. concluded the day.

Horse races were held at the Mr Nankervis’s Cross Roads Inn.

[* A jingling match: a game in which one player keeps ringing a bell while the others, all blindfolded, try to catch him or her.]
