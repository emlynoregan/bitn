Cr Lee moved that the Brass Band equipment be stored in a shed at the rear of the Institute instead of in the Ambulance shed, where it is now.  This would make room for storing the trailer pump and its fittings.  Carried.

Mr A.B. Aldam submitted plans for an asbestos or iron and wood building on the vacant land adjacent to the Billiard Saloon and utilising one wall of the saloon.  Not approved.
