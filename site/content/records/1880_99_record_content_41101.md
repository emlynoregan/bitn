Recent alterations included the removal and arching of the back wall of the hall and adding two dressing rooms at the rear.  The stage proscenium is nicely finished off with pillars each side surmounted by caps of modern architecture.  The stage has been enlarged and has now a depth of 16’ and a width wall to wall of 34’.  The dressing rooms are 16’6” x 12’, divided by folding doors.  A 6’ wide escape door has been provided in one side of the hall and the walls and ceiling have been cleaned and kalsomined and the mouldings picked out in colours.  Large bracket lamps to the walls replace the hanging lamps.  The architects were Williams & Goode, but we cannot compliment them on their knowledge of stage needs as it could easily have been 4-5’ deeper.  The retiring rooms should have had an exit door to the outside.  Another fault is that the gable roof has not been carried right through the building and a gutter has been formed - gutters between gables are a well-known problem.  The contractors, Launder & Pearce have carried the work out very well.  The scenery provided by Messrs Harrison & Fyfe is very satisfactory.  The drop curtain is crimson.  Forest landscape, drawing room & kitchen scenes are provided.  Mr Stone, late of the Theatre Royal was the scenic artist.  The landscape is particularly well done with level foreground, hills in the distance, with a road and lake at their foot.  The forest scene is also very good.  The Institute reopens on 22 April with More Sinned Against than Sinning.
