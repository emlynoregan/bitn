Burra Town Council will improve the safety of school children by installing large ‘Children’ signs on the highway opposite the Town Hall and swing bridge approach.  [The swing bridge had been demolished in 1960 and closed for some time before that!] ‘School’ signs will be installed on Bridge Terrace near the school and ‘Children’ signs in Kingston Street.
