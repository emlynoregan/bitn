H.J. Button writes further in a lengthy letter on the same lines concerning Mr Carne’s comments about the desirability of having more returned men in Council.  [He has ascertained that Mr Carne wrote the RSL notes in the paper.]  He says that he understands the President of the RSL disassociated himself from the comments and that Cr Jennison was indignant about them.  Why on nomination day was W. Dixon Thompson’s nomination absent?
