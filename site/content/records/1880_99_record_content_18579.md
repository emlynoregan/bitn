The Mayor said the Hydraulic Engineer ‘was labouring under an hallucination’.  In interviews with Mr Mestayer he had gained the impression that the engineer agreed that more horsepower was necessary and correspondence bore out that view.  The question was would the larger engine be better for the council and that point was not addressed.

Cr Sampson thought it a waste of time to continue the correspondence.  The engineer had insulted the Council by saying they were incompetent to run the works.  He moved a deputation go to the Commissioner of Public works to interview him in the presence of the Hydraulic Engineer and that the letter be referred to the Waterworks Committee.  Cr Tiver 2nd.
