Cricket.  A meeting is called for Burra Cricket Club at R.D. Pascoe’s on 21 January to arrange for a slate pitch.

‘Whip’ berates the cricketers for not attending business meetings which are essential to the running of the club.  Mr Lawes, as secretary, is doing his best with little support.

On 1 January at Victoria Park Burra 119 defeated the Slag Extraction Works 48.

Burra Defence Rifle Club.  On 2 January Burra 857 defeated Clare 716.

Commercial Travellers’ Defence Rifle Club 711 defeated Burra D.R.C. 674.

Also on 1 January Burra 791 defeated Medical Staff Corps 587 even though the Burra boys were using old Martini-Henry rifles and the opposition had .303 rifles.
