Burra Memorial Oval Management Committee

Elected: Chairman, John Secomb; Deputy Chairman, Graham Kellock; Secretary, Rick Pearse and Treasurer, Col Baker.

Apart from day to day maintenance the first task will be to prepare a master plan for needed improvements, including long awaited new clubrooms.

A Joint Meeting of the Burra Burra DC, Burra District Advisory Committee and the National Trust on 26 July discussed a number of projects to plan further lines of action.

A plan for the first stage beautification of the creek was approved.

On Saturday members of the Works Committee and Advisory Committee and the Swimming Pool Committee visited the pool to suggest option for its upgrading.

Other matters discussed were the upgrading of the Town Hall and an idea of a submission to the Arts Advisory Committee to fund a skilled stone mason to work in the Burra Community for twelve months.
