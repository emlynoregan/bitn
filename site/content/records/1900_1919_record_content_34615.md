The Federal Election.

A large crowd gathered in Commercial St to see the figures displayed as they came to hand in the Burra Record telegrams.  Both Liberal and Labor supporters subscribed to meet the costs.  Returns continued to be posted Monday and Tuesday.  Mr Ogilvy, Kooringa postmaster, was the returning officer and Mr W.H. Hardy the presiding officer.  Results for the Kooringa sub-division are given.  In this subdivision all the referendums were lost, generally about 790 to 1300.
