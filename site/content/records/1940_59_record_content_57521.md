The Wheat Harvest this year is a bumper.  The crop benefited from late heavy rains.  The best crop in the district is said to be that of Brendan Hogan of Leighton, which we understand was 17 bags per acre.  The wheat stack at Burra is 12,000 bags.  The price is also good at 16/8 a bushel or £2-10-0 a bag.  With 7/- for the bag and 3/- for freight the farmer gets £2 a bag.  Bag sewers are in demand with an average man sewing 200 a day and a top man 300.  They earn £3 per 100 bags.

Burra Town Hall was inspected recently and the outside woodwork was found to be in a bad state and in need of painting.  Interior painting is also needed.

Foxes are plentiful and two have been seen in Burra Creek behind the Burra Motor Co.  Out East they are seriously hampering rabbiters.  One trapper setting 120 traps a night is getting only 14 rabbits a day and foxes are taking 40 to 50 pairs a day.

Burra Caravan Park.  The Council recently authorised the purchase of the materials needed to complete the buildings.  Shortages of cement will delay floors and bathroom construction.

Electricity.  ETSA is not willing or not able at present to extend high tension lines from Waterloo with effort concentrated of servicing Radium Hill.  The local company is reluctant to dispose of its plant and lines cheaply, either to the Council or to ETSA.  Meanwhile local housewives look enviously at others who can enjoy the luxury of an all-electric home with stoves etc.  The local domestic user and employer both suffer from the effects of the high price of local power.  A solution would be for the local company or the Council to buy in bulk from ETSA, but the £50,000 cost of the line from Waterloo is the stumbling block.  The cost to Council would be more like £70,000, as they would have to acquire the local transmission lines.  The question is whether people in Burra would buy enough electricity to justify a Council borrowing £70,000.
