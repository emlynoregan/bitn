Draft Tourism Strategy

The Burra, Clare, Auburn-Saddleworth and Riverton Councils have undertaken to develop a tourism strategy and the draft plan has now been completed by PPK Planning and Hannaford, Benson, Ainslie Pty Ltd.  It is recommended the term ‘Lower Mid North’ be replaced by Clare-Burra to describe the area more effectively.  The study identifies three main sub regions: Clare Valley, Burra and Gilbert Valley.  Clare-Burra was chosen because of its recognised national identity.  The strategy aims to increase tourism and promoted sustainable development.  Opportunities for development include antique trails, educational trips, historic homestead tours, a copper trail from Burra to Port Wakefield or Kapunda, wine and food appreciation events, cemetery tours, heritage and a genealogy centre at Burra.  There is also a suggestion of uniting the various tourist organisations in to one Regional Economic Development Board, employing a tourism officer to implement the strategy plan and create opportunities that it implies.
