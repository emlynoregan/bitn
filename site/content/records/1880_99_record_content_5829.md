2nd Leader on The Burra Hospital - one of the most useful of local institutions and open to the whole of the north and north-eastern districts.  Although a public hospital, it gets some £200 p.a. from subscriptions.  The costs for 1881 have been only c. 3/6 per head of patients - made possible by the doctors [Brummitt & Sangster] not charging for attendance.  This saves the Government £500 p.a. for which the whole district owes them a debt of gratitude.
