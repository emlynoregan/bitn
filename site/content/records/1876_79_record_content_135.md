‘An Inhabitant’ writes commenting on how gratifying it was on Sunday to hear from St Mary’s a call for cleanliness in body, mind and soul.  As far as cleanliness of body is concerned a number of things militate against it.  A well ventilated dwelling and purity of atmosphere are to be desired.  But where there are foul smells, foul drains cloacæ of the vilest and most disgusting class, the ground strewn with offal and the most excrementitious filth, then typhoid and scarlet fever will abound and have not been absent from the town for the past two years.  As many as ten contemporaneous cases of typhoid have attracted the attention of the Board of Health.  The cemetery can bear silent witness to the continuous influx of children who might otherwise have become healthy and useful adults.  The system of allotments cut up by speculators into insignificant fragments to be sold or rented at a high price without any care and proper accommodation of the labouring population is an arrangement, which in comparatively warm climates, such as our own, constitutes a perfect nursery for epidemic and contagious diseases.

The preacher [Rev. H. Howitt] condemned the overcrowding which prevails in the wretched dwelling houses that are so supinely tolerated in the town.  There is, he said, an apparent want of energy on the part of various official persons, to whom he had made urgent and repeated addresses in vain, for some prompt action to prevent the spread of demoralising tendencies and malaria.

It was this lack of action that had prompted his use of the pulpit.
