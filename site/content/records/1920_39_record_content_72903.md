Burra Show.  Since the show on 28 October discussions seem to lean in favour of holding it on a Wednesday, probably the Wednesday following the Clare Show.  The Saturday has to contend with various opposition events like the Tanunda Band Competitions and the Melbourne Racing Carnival and as it is the last of the Northern Shows it delays inter-show exhibitors.  Saturday also interferes with the weekend routines of shop assistants etc.
