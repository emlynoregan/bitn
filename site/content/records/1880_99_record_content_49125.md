Burra Town Council, Special Meeting, 7 March.

This was needed to deal with the pay sheet which had not been dealt with amid the chaos at the end of the previous meeting.

Cr Parks asked the Mayor if it were legal to deal with a matter that had been adjourned to the 20 March.  He said it was, but many ratepayers protested at this dealing with ordinary business at an extraordinary meeting.
