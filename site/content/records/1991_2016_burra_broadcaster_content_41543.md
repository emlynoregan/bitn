Thefts.  An Adelaide Hills man has been arrested for numerous thefts of farming and transport equipment valued at more than $1.5 million.  Police recovered about $960,000 worth of stolen equipment in SA and Queensland.  This included heavy earth moving equipment and other farm equipment stolen between 2006 and 2015.  The items included a purpose built car-racing transport trailer stolen from Burra last August.  [Photo.]
