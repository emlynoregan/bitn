2nd Leader on the balance sheet of the Burra Town Council.  £2,500 was raised by loan on bonds discounted by 7%.

The survey money has been placed on fixed deposit as it has been found insufficient for the work.

£500 for the Recreation Ground has been expended.  This is a problem since although the bonds will have to be repaid, the Recreation Ground is not generating income.

£1,617-4-1 has been spent on public works.

The town has been much improved with respect to footways, roads and bridges.
