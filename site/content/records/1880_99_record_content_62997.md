Local Board of Health.

Sanitary conditions and health of the town are fairly satisfactory.  There were a few typhoid cases in summer, but very few of those in the Burra Hospital originated locally.  New arrangements have been made for keeping the watertables clean which has improved the general cleanliness of streets.  The main expense here is for the scavenger who got £70 of the £100 collected in rates.

The year’s small overdraft should be handled with ease next year in the absence of any bonded debt to be repaid.

The mayor gave special thanks for the work of W. Davey as Town Clerk.
