Copper Find.  Some good copper specimens have been found some 30 miles east of Burra.  A meeting to explain particulars of the discovery to those interested was held in the Institute on Monday.  Unfortunately no lode was discovered; the samples coming from a ‘throw off’ or ‘blow up’.  The meeting could not raise the £100 needed to further test the site.  Since then however, a private syndicate has found the necessary capital.
