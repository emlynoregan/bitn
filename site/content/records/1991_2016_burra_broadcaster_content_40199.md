Emergency Services Minister, Tony Piccolo, after attending Community Cabinets on the West Coast, visited Burra on his return.  He hosted a breakfast with about 25 representatives of regional CFS, SES, & MFS staff and also met with staff and volunteers of various community groups.  Central to discussions was the proposed reform of the emergency services sector.  While regions will be much the same and so will units, brigades and stations on the ground, a merging of the corporate and support areas is aimed at savings, to be re-invested in the sector.
