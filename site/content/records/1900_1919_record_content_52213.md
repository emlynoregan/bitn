The YMCA at Burra

[There is a series of confusing letters about the name of the YMCA in Burra and the title of the recently unveiled Honour Roll.]

Ernest W. Crewes writes assuring J.G. Sara that the steps needed to change ‘Kooringa District’ to ‘Burra & District’ on the Honour Roll are in hand.

[That seems straightforward except that the paper at the time of the unveiling the report says it was headed the ‘Burra District Honour Roll’.]

Then ‘Disgusted’ writes suggesting that Mr Sara should go to France and stop nitpicking over the title of the Honour Board.

[Even when I re-read the letter of J.G. Sara published the previous week I still got the impression he was asking for a change in the name of the local YMCA Branch and that the changing of the name on the roll was cited as a parallel, but with both Crewes and ‘Disgusted’ drawing very different conclusions the situation must have looked different at the time.]

Hon. Sec. G. Horner of the local YMCA writes saying that the official name of the local branch was chosen when it was formed two years earlier and was ‘Burra Auxiliary Committee YMCA Army Department’. 

[The cause of the dispute was either the inappropriate narrowing of the scope of the Honour Roll which was expected to serve a larger area than the title apparently implied at first, or (perhaps ‘and’?) the inappropriateness of the narrow title of the Burra YMCA, when they were currently making a special appeal across the wider district.

In any case this was indicative of attitudes that can be seen emerging elsewhere indicating a feeling in the wider community that the town of Burra liked to bath in the glory of patriotic efforts that drew their strength from a much wider area that the name ‘Burra’ by itself seemed to imply.  Mr Crewes later got into other difficulties over this and I.J. Warnes was outspoken on it as well.  It probably is most prominent in the heated debate over the Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial that was yet to come.]
