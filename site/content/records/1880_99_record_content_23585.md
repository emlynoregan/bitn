Baldina Trip reported by the Roach Brothers.

The Hundred of Baldina is divided into the inner and outer plains, which have been under cultivation for about 12 years.  The inner plain sloped east, terminating in a low range called the Black Hills.  This is excellent agricultural country with fair rainfall, though lower than in Burra.  This inner plain has 3,000 to 4,000 acres under wheat.  The outer plain is saltbush country and is good for wheat, only the rainfall is quite unreliable.  In the 12 years of settlement it has had only one really good crop - in the first year.  A large proportion of settlers here have either sold out or deserted their holdings.  The remainder, principally Germans, have about 3,000 acres under wheat in this outer plain.  As a rule wheat here is up by 1 May, but this year there was no rain till near the end of July and the wheat broke through by the 1 August.  The crops look healthy and green, but at the same time rather lacking in strength and vigour.  They average only 6‚Äù high and yet with as many as 6 joints in the straw.  Yields are hard to estimate as the next few weeks will be vital, but 5-6 bushels per acres might eventuate.
