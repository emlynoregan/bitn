The Burra Show, Wednesday 22 October.

Ideal weather drew a large crowd.  A special train ran from Terowie.  The grounds were in perfect condition.  Sideshows were numerous.  Takings for lunch and afternoon tea by the Soldiers’ Aid Soc. were £118 and the profit will go to Red Cross.  Gate takings were £97 – low because by an act of omission no charge was made for vehicles.  £37 was taken at the picture show and a dance followed where Mr Broderick was the MC and over £8 was taken.

Agricultural produce was excellent, dairy produce was down in quantity, but of good quality.  Poultry had as usual a large showing.  Horse entries were very good.  Dogs were rather poor and cattle and sheep numbers were low, but of first class quality.  Agricultural implement display was one of the largest ever seen in SA.  Vegetables and flowers were both of a high standard.  Cookery was well patronised.  Arts & Industries required much more room than was available and competition in the school class was keen.
