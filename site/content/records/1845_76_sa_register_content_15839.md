Kooringa News, 13 August

The Kooringa Freemasons Lodge gave a ball at the Burra Hotel on Thursday.  Schraederâ€™s band came up from Adelaide.  The company was more select than numerous on account of the weather and the bad state of the roads.

Assault.  On Saturday evening a man named Meedon struck his wife with a broomstick and fractured both her arms; one of them in two places.

Kooringa Primitive Methodists the anniversary of their chapel on Sunday when the preachers were Revs J. Pithouse and H. Cole.  The weather rather dampened enthusiasm and also reduced attendance at the Monday tea meeting.  It was so cold, wet and windy that the meeting could hardly be called public, with only the most determined of members attending.

Yesterday at the Kooringa Methodist Chapel Rev. J. Pithouse conducted a temperance meeting, after which 16 persons signed the pledge.

Last Tuesday evening a lecture was given at the Burra Hotel by Mr G. Isaacs on the topic Ancient Superstitions.

The past week has been most wintry.  Monday was wet and stormy with a perfect gale in the evening.  Many of the creeks are swollen and the Mt Remarkable mail cart was delayed on the road some two or three hours and eventually the mail had to be sent on by horseback.

Obituary.  A man named Cox died suddenly at Princesston [i.e. Princess Town] but he had been under medical treatment and no inquest was deemed necessary.

[Daniel Cox died 9 August 1862 at Kooringa aged 62.]

Accident.  A man named Robinson came in from the bush suffering from a grievous hand wound occasioned by an accident while firing a gun.  Drs Maurau and Morgan found it necessary to amputate the injured limb.
