Annual United Friendly Societies’ Sports were held at Victoria Park on Boxing Day in excellent weather and a great many people in consequence turned out.  The Burra Band led a procession of the lodge members from the Institute to the Park at about 10 o’clock.  The gate takings were c. £40; the highest for several years.  The results are printed.
