‘Dullite’ writes seeking clarification on the town’s electric supply given that contradictory statements about the negotiations between ETSA and the local company have been published.

‘Is our Corporation on top of the situation?

Has our local company offered anything to the trust?

If so, is the price too high?

Has the Trust rejected the offer?’

If the local company carries on, can we have light and power without the high fluctuations in voltage we now get and can we have electric stoves and hot water systems at the price the Trust can supply?
