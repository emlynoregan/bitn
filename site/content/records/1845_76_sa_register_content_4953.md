Mr W.S. Chauncy’s Report on the Survey of the Northern Railway to the SA Railway Committee.

Report on a line of railway from Port Adelaide to the Burra.

The beginning was surveyed with a view to connection with a railway from Adelaide to the Port and with a connection to the North Arm.  The line from Port Adelaide to the city as proposed would be 254 yards shorter than any previous proposal, but would involve acquiring 32 acres of private land, which at an average cost of £10 per acre amounts to £320 – a sum more than covered by the savings in the length of the route.

The distance from the Port to Gawler is 22¼ miles and would be 27 miles from Adelaide by the same route.  One bridge costing c. £500 would be needed.

From Gawler northwards the line would encounter the necessity of crossing a high ridge.  An attempt to avoid this by going a little further west certainly found easier gradients, but was frustrated by the need to descend some 400 feet to the River Light.

For these reason I determined on a survey through level country westward of the present roads, beginning from a point about 5 miles south of Gawler and travelling thence north-westerly.

Some have suggested horse power, but this has already been addressed in a paper published by me and dismissed as impracticable.

The proposed main line crosses the Gawler River about 6 miles below the town and continues in the same direction until it passes through the southwest point of the large scrub on the north side of the Gawler.  It then adopts a northerly direction.  It crosses the River Light near a place known as Red Banks and about 12 miles below the junction of the Light with the Gilbert.  The bridges over the Gawler and Light Rivers would each cost c. £1,000.

The distance from Port Adelaide to the Light is 33 miles and thence to the Wakefield is 20 miles.  The whole of this distance will require almost no cuttings or embankments and for 40 miles travels through Crown Lands.  The soil is good, but some 8 miles of scrub will have to be negotiated.  The want of water is a problem, but wells would be dug at convenient intervals to serve this purpose.  The Wakefield is crossed some 20 miles from the head of the gulf.  The bridge here would be more expensive.  From there the line crosses 5 miles of scrub and several sand ridges, which would require two cuttings 30 feet deep (which would be preferable to the alternative length of curves to avoid the cuttings).  After the scrub there is a plain for 16 miles to the Emu Mines.  All this area is fit for the plough and would surely be taken up if the railway were built.

I propose at present to terminate the line at 10 miles beyond the Wakefield, 70 miles from Adelaide, 10 miles from the Emu Mines and 30 miles from Burra.  To continue to Burra would necessitate more expenditure on cuttings and other earthworks than the likely traffic would justify.

The result of the survey is very favourable for the construction of the line and the cost of construction would suggest that the line could carry ores and other heavy goods at the rate of 2½d to 3d per ton per mile.  Also more than 200,000 acres of land would be thrown open to the public, the sale of which would enable the Government to provide a supply of labour for carrying out the undertaking without fear of affecting the labour market.

No doubt British capital could be obtained for such a venture; especially with a Government guarantee of 5% for 21 years.
