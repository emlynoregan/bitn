Laurie Sullivan

I have nominated for re-election to see through the process of change started with the amalgamation of Councils

I believe the amalgamation to have been successful, despite the increasing imposts placed on us by the State Government

The amalgamation has allowed more roads to be sealed

I served on the Hallett Council for 13 years, some of that time as Chairman
