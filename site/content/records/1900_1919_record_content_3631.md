Income for the year was £81-17-0 and expenditure £84-13-6.  £30 was paid off the debt and the trust debt stands at £149.  There are 153 scholars at the Sunday school.  Sunday congregations remain large and regular.  The church had 60 members and there were a further 70 members in the 5 other places in the circuit.  About £90 was needed as a special effort to renovate the parsonage, for furniture and removal expenses and for a new fence at the circuit paddock where stray cattle were stealing grass.
