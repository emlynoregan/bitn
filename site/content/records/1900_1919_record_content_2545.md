A New ‘Sunshine’ Harvester was given a working field trial on R. Field’s farm on Wednesday before about 55 farmers.  The day was cold and the straw damp.  It was also windy and the crop heavy and in places badly knocked down.  The machine performed very well.  It strips, winnows, screens and bags in one operation.  It was here worked by four horses, though three are more common, and controlled by one man.  The farmers present were most impressed by its action.
