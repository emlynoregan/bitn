Pte W. O’Connell was presented with a wrist watch in the Burra Council Chamber on Monday night.  The Mayor said ‘Bill’ was well known in the district.  He was a bit of a rough diamond, but a good bushman and had worked on many stations in the district.

Pilot Officer Vic. Richardson addressed a meeting in the Council Chambers on Monday requesting people in Burra to form a Voluntary Air Observers Corps to man an Air Observation Post in the town.  He described the work and how the system operated.  Ideally they needed 56 volunteers so that each member kept watch three hours per week.  The general rule was that ladies took the day shifts and men the night shifts.  It was decided to form a corps and a committee was established.
