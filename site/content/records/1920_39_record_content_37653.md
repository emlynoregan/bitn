Cr McWaters for the District Council said at one time the District Council had £1,300 main road grant, but now it had reduced such that good roads were drifting into a bad condition.  The ration system was unsatisfactory.  There should be some production from its cost of £15-20,000 a week.  The Council had £300 to £400 to maintain 27 miles of main road, which was a flea bite to what was really required.  Two bridges on the Eudunda Road needed urgent repair lest there be accidents.  He thought men could be put to work developing some of the mallee lands.  He sought a grant of £400.
