Aleppo Pines

The Aloppo Pine (Pinus halepensis) was introduced in the 1800s and has become a rapidly spreading weed.  It is a declared species under the Natural Resources Management Act.  It is invasive and forms a mat of needles that inhibits the germination of native species.  It has spread particularly on roadsides and disturbed sites or where overgrazing has reduced native vegetation.  Larger pines can be killed by ringbarking and younger ones hand pulled or cut off below the level of green needles.  Burraâ€™s Clean Up Australia Day Sunday will work on reducing these pines around Burra.
