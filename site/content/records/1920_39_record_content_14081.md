Burra Town Council, last Monday.

Ford Bros. say their old yards could be made into a pound for c. Â£5.  Cr Kellaway moved they be interviewed re cost etc. and that the DC be consulted with re a joint pound.

The Fire Brigade has explained why the bell rang for 20 minutes recently.  It was put down to a misunderstanding.  Not all regarded the explanation as satisfactory.
