Burra Town Council

At a recent meeting the Town Clerk said he had information from Renmark that the unimproved land values system of rating was working well there.

Cr S.J. Woollacott has changed his mind and thought the system would not work in Burra where there were many unimproved blocks, some of which would never be built on.

Cr Marston said that in Murray Bridge blocks that could not be improved were charged reduced rates.  In Burra this could be done for the Mine Block for instance.

The Mayor was a supporter of the unimproved system.
