‘Old Subscriber’ writes thanking the paper for its sensible reporting of municipal matters.  The Record was clearly in possession of the circumstances and was able to pour oil on the troubled waters and presented the facts without undue criticism or sensationalism.  [See the Ratepayers’ Meeting VX, 880, 1 Dec. 1909, Pages 3 & 4.]
