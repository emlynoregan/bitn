Burra Burra Mines

A report in the Perth Inquirer of 18 February says the Burra Burra Mine is the wonder of the world: it exceeds the celebrated Pargo Mine in the ratio of a million to one.  The ore is 75% metal – a pure oxide needing no flux to smelt it. The lode is 17 ft wide and of vast extent.  Ten weeks’ work has sufficed to produce £17,000 value of ore.  [This and further hyperbole.]
