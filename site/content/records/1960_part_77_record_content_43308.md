Burra Mine

Mr Allen MP recently asked in Parliament whether there will be provision made for natural gas to be supplied from the pipeline to Burra.  Premier Hon. R.S. Hall undertook to bring the matter to the notice of the Minister of Mines and to get a reply.  The reply was that while technical problems re the economic recovery of the copper remain to be solved the question is somewhat academic, but there is no doubt that if the economics justify it, gas could be made available.
