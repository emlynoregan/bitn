SA Stud Merino Field Days at Burra Oval featured more studs than in previous years.  Collinsville Stud featured for the first time and so did Minta from Eyre Peninsula and Glenlea of Pinnaroo.  This year’s Champion Pair came from Balaklava Stud ‘Nyowee’.  Greenfields were judged as having the 2004 Elders Merino Capital Ram – a prize they also won in 2001 & 2002.
