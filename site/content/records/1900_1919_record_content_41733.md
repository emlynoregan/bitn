Belgian Flag Day was held on Monday 10 May.

After just three weeks preparation it was a marvellous success.  Shops were decorated and bunting hung out in Commercial St, Market Square and Aberdeen.  The news of the sinking of the Lusitania cast a temporary gloom over the morning.

The rotunda was gay with flags and bunting and Belgian colours.  One group was busy taking goods for auction from Lane’s empty shop which had been used as a depot.  The weather, though cold, was bright and sunny.  28 motor cars formed the procession.  [Owners are listed.]  A.J. McBride’s car was judged the most appropriate, F. Custance’s was the most beautiful and I.J. Warnes’ car which was disguised as HMAS Sydney was the most original.  It had a gun which fired to the thrill of young ladies and smoke issued from one of the three funnels.  The Ragged Orchestra appeared on the old Mine Fire Engine – Masters Frank Howard, Reg. West, Vincent Cox, M. Cox, Clarence & Cyril Griffiths and R. Fuss.  [Probably Eric Russell Fuss]
