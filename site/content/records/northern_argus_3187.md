Fire Appliances

The Director of the CFS in SA has announced that the CFS Board will allocate a new vehicle to be housed at Baldina area at no cost to the Burra Burra DC.

On 13 October a recommendation was put to the Burra Burra DC by the Burra & District Fire Fighting Association that three more Hino 4x4 2,000 litre fire appliances, fully equipped, be funded by Council with CFS Board contributing 70% of the capital cost.  Council agreed to contribute $60,000 by means of a debenture loan over five years.  The four appliances subsidised by Council are valued at $336,000 and will be allocated to Farrell Flat, Mt Bryan, Burra and Baldina.  They should be available in late April/May 1988.  The present appliances will then be sold by tender.
