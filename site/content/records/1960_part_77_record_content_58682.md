Burra Mine

Sales of copper oxide are satisfactory on both local and the overseas markets.  One hundred and forty-three thousand pounds have been produced since 30 June.  Stage 1 of construction at the Mine has been completed.  Design and stage two of the operation has proceeded.  Pilot plant tests have been partially completed to enable the selection of a final design for the roasting plant.  Stage 2 will see production of ore rise to 1,000 tons per day.  Recently installed drying equipment is operating satisfactorily.  Samin Ltd and Roche Bros have agreed to supply the Burra Burra DC with metal for road making.  The existing Council quarry has almost been cleaned out.  The new supplies will come from the northern open cut section, which will not be mined in Stage 1 of operations.
