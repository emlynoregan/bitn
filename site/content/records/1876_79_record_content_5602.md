Filling etc.	£250

If there is no subsidy then a special grant is sought, as such a sum out of a year's rates of only £600 was unreasonable.

Burra Waterworks. Secondly, the same deputation sought a more efficient water supply for the town. A recent Govt. engineer found a well that yielded only 1,000 gallons an hour. The deputation asked for a standpipe in Market Square from which water carts might take water. The water supply was sadly deficient as the total loss of the Miners' Arms recently by fire indicated.

Rabbits. Thirdly they urged rabbit destruction get high priority.

Response. Mr Playford said that the money expended on the bridge would be supplemented by the Govt. except for the £25 transfer cost. He pointed out that a Govt. water supply would bring with it a water rate. The Rabbit Act would be enforced now the harvest was over.

Rabbits. A public meeting at the Institute on 27 December called for united and simultaneous action to be taken to destroy rabbits. It called for strict enforcement from 1 Feb. 1879. It demanded more staff to clear Crown Lands.
