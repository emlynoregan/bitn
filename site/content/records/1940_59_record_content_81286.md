Burra Primary School Parents & Friends’ Assoc. held its AGM 2 April.  Elected: Chairman, M.G. Stockman and Secretary & Treasurer, Mr D.H. Field.  Last April saw the erection of a new classroom allowing each grade a separate room.  The school has moved up to a Class III.  The school has been painted inside and out this year and the balance of the yard sealed and drainage has been improved.  Completion of the furnishing of the lunch room should be done soon.  We still need a staff room and a bike shed.
