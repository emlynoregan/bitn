It could take the place of kettles and pots.

It held the water supply in the kitchen.

It served to water the horse.

It held mangles [sic: for mangels] for the cow.

It served as a bucket at milking time.

It caught the honey from wild beesâ€™ hives.

Surplus eggs were preserved in it.

It could serve as a dustbin

Or a baking dish

Or a cake tin.

It was sometimes a watering can.

It could be a bread crock

And now it is passing into history.
