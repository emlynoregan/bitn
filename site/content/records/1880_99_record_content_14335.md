Supreme Court.

William James McBride petitioned the court for the dissolution of his marriage to Ada McBride nee Barrett [check Barnett?]. He had been married on 25 March 1884, but business had forced him to go to Queensland on 19 May, leaving his wife at home with his sister as a companion.  He returned on 21 July.  He alleged his wife’s adultery with Ferdinand Schutz on 19 May and on other days in May, June & July 1884.

On arriving in Adelaide he had received a communication from his mother, which had resulted in his arrival at his home in the company of P-C Radford and Frederick Ulrich.  He obtained access via a window and Ferdinand Schutz had been found under his wife’s bed clad only in a shirt.

His Honour said he would report the allegation of adultery proved to the Full Court.

[Insert here the remarriage information for both parties.]
