Burra Town Council, 16 December.

The Commissioner of Railways advises he could not run a bus from Terowie for the convenience of AIF men home on leave for the weekend.

E.L. Steer won the tender to paint the Rotunda.

The Mayor assured Cr Lott that the Council had been concerned about a stop sign at Finch’s corner long before he bought the garage and as far as the rubbish behind the garage, he knew nothing of it.

Police will investigate vandalism to pine trees along the creek.
