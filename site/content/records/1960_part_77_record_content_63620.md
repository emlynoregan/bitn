Mrs Eliza Sampson of Dunbar Presbyterian Home Goodwood is 100.  She was born Eliza Slate and lived with her widowed mother, brother and sisters in one of the Mine Cottages in Kooringa and attended the Burra Model School when Mr Caterer [sic: for Cater] was headmaster.  Her late husband was Mr A.A. (Archie) Sampson, son of the late John Sampson of Kooringa, a former Mayor and Councillor of Burra.  With her husband and family she moved from Burra to Broken Hill where they lived for many years.  One of her childhood memories is when in the company of other youngsters she visited Aborigines who were living in the dugouts in the Mine Region after it had closed.
