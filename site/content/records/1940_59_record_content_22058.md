The Market Square Rotunda.  It was not long since the Council had removed the fence around the rotunda and at the last meeting of the Town Council Cr Bevan suggested that the ground be terraced, planted with flowers and enclosed.  Cr Harvey said it would look nice, but as the Council had no gardener, the question was how were the flowers going to be kept looking nice.

Cr Carpenter moved that the guard [sic: presumably for ground] round the Rotunda by terraced and planted with flowers.  He offered to look after the garden for twelve months.  He also offered to give five bags of cement for the necessary concreting.  Cr Harvey then offered a further five bags of cement.  Cr Bevan seconded the motion, which was then carried.
