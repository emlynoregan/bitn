Burra Town Council.

The Postmaster General advises that too few letters are delivered at the Aberdeen Post Office to justify a postal delivery.

The Hydraulic Engineer advises that Mr Henderson is giving up the lease on the Market Square standpipe and if no suitable replacement can be found the standpipe will be removed.

Seven trees have been destroyed from Young St to the Railway Bridge.

Frank Harris has had his shop front renovated.

Mrs Holden, of Redruth Reformatory, was presented with a purse of sovereigns and a silver set for the dining table by the Mayoress on behalf of well wishers.

Salvation Army.  The moving pictures shown at the Barracks on Monday night were well attended.

‘Parent’ Writes claiming that parents are keeping children home from school because of its unsanitary state and the fact that three or four children in one family have been stricken with typhoid at Redruth and their brothers and sister are still attending school.

The Editor says: Two children in Redruth have typhoid.  Dr Sangster says there is no reason to think the school is the source and though these cases require watchfulness there is no need for panic.

Ratepayers’ Meeting at the Institute on 24 November.

J.E.H. Winnall presided.

The Mayor’s Report occupies about 2 columns.

The mayor, Dr Sangster jun., expressed his regret at the death of Sir Frederick Holder during the year.  Mr Bartholomaeus, Town Clerk, resigned through ill health in May.  He had served 10 years without a holiday and he was presented with a silver salver in appreciation.  His replacement, Mr Steele, was appointed to the combined position of Town Clerk and Inspector.  Mr Thomas, curator of the cemetery, also resigned through ill health.  Nobody applied to replace him under the old terms and the new conditions of £2-2-0 a week and 2/- per Sunday saw Mr W. Harris appointed from 5 applicants.  This is a big increase in cost, but he will help the dayman, which will cut out the need for casual labour in ward works.  The cost will be met £60 from the cemetery account, £46 from ward work and £8 from main roads.  A new building on the site of the present Kooringa Post Office will begin to be built about March 1910 and it will provide for private boxes and a telephone exchange.  Telephonic communication with Adelaide will be effected in 1910.  The community benefited greatly in 1909 from the generosity of a small group of well-known men in the formation of the Aberdeen Oval and the transfer there of the Show.
