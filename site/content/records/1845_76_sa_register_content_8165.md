The Patent Copper Company

Mr Walters, the Manager of the Patent Copper Company is leaving for England in the Sibella.  He is accompanied as far as Valparaiso by E.K. Horn, who has lately been in charge of the company’s interests at Port Wakefield.  Mr Walters intends to purchase a number of mules in South America and to send them to SA under the care of Mr Horn.  It is intended to try using mules to conduct the company’s carriage operations between Burra and Port Wakefield in place of bullock drays, which are now idle for want of drivers.  Many stations in NSW now have their rations and produce conveyed by means of mules.
