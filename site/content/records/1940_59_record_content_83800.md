Obituary.  Sir Hubert Wilkins died in America last night aged 70.  He was born at Mt Bryan East.  Last February on his way from Antarctica to Alaska he visited SA after a 17 year absence and he visited his old home, spending several days at Mt Bryan East, Hallett, Ulooloo and Burra, where he renewed old acquaintances.  At Ulooloo he collected stones from old mine diggings to add to his collection.  After his trip to Alaska he went to his home in Pennsylvania USA.  After that he anticipated visiting the Belgian Congo â€“ one of the few places he had not been in 47 years of travelling.  [George Hubert Wilkins born 31 October 1888 Mt Bryan East, but birth apparently not registered in SA: died 30 November 1958 Framingham Mass. USA.]
