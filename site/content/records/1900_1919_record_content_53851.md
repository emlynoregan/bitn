[Henry Hosking Turner born 29 August 1893.]

Burra Town Council, Monday.

Miss cave complained of lack of water.  It was very poor in the morning and entirely lacking after 8 p.m. till late at night.

Cr McWaters said there were widespread complaints.  The attention of the Hydraulic Engineer will be drawn to the situation.

There was a discussion with T.P. Halls on cab fares.

Matron Bubb objected to paying Mr Halls 11/6 ‘for taking an officer and little girl to and the officer back to the station’.  [Check this quote, as it seems not to make sense.]  Consideration deferred.

Hotels have accepted the further 10% cut in their assessment.
