Burra Town Hall

An appeal is being made for funds to improve the Town Hall and a series of functions will assist.  A target of £4,000 has been set for a new supper room and kitchen.  The building was first opened on 27 August 1857.  Additions were made in 1874, when two foundation stones were laid and the front took on the appearance it has today.  Further additions this century have seen the hall enlarged and the dress circle added, the erection of four dressing rooms and conveniences at the rear and the stage enlarged.  The property was transferred from the Trustees of the Burra Institute to the Corporation of Burra in 1945.  Plans and specifications for the kitchen and supper room have been completed.  Donations to date total £725-11-7.
