The Special Survey of Mineral Land Taken at Last

Having rejected the offer of Messrs Bagot and Aston of 12,000 sovereigns and the acceptance of the Bank of SA, the Governor later offered to sell the Special Survey land to the highest bidder on what may be regarded as a long credit with a deposit of 10%.

The Governor’s new offer was for the survey of a block of 20,000 or more acres, which must be in a compact block with one side no more than twice the length of any other side.  The block must be pointed out to the Surveyor General or to the officer appointed by him for that purpose within ten days from the date for acceptance of the tender: Wednesday 20 August 1845.  A deposit of 10% of the price offered must be paid into the Treasury at the time of the opening of tenders and the notification of the acceptance of either of the tenders.  The residue of the money to be paid within three months from that date and on failure of such payment the deposit shall be forfeited and the contract be null and void.  The Government will not object to two grants for the portions of the survey instead of one grant for the entire block, provided a request to this effect is inserted in the tender.  A fee of 10 guineas will be charged upon delivery of each grant.

The Government reserves the right to make roads, railroads, canals or bridges and to take clay, stone gravel and indigenous timber for the construction and repair of roads, bridges, fences, embankments, dams, sewers, drains and other public works.

Under 15 Sect. of c. 36 5th & 6th Vict. being the Act for regulation of the sale of waste lands belonging to the Crown in the Australian Colonies the amount tendered cannot be less than one pound per acre.

Identical letters were sent to the Manager of the SA Company and to Messrs S. Stocks Esq. and other competing gentlemen.

[The paper considered that this amounted to the Governor availing himself of the two parties’ infatuation with mining, to draw from them the largest possible sum he could get and of relaxing his demands only to increase the chances of their indiscretion leading them to make an offer.  There was the possibility of speculative competition forcing up the price.]

Fortunately the South Australian Company decided not to become a competitor in this tender system and this left the field for a coalition of the remaining two parties who then united for the purpose of securing the survey by purchase without tender at the upset price of twenty shillings (£1) per acre.

A.M. Mundy as Colonial Secretary accepted their offer.

[The paper considered the Governor had blundered by not adhering strictly to the demand for all the purchase money to be paid down.  In stead he had acted ‘not in the spirit of the Waste Lands act, but by affording the utmost facilities to mere adventurers to gamble with the rich lands of the colony’.  The article develops these views at some length.]

We shall be met perhaps with the assertion that the letters from the Colonial Secretary dated 15 August have been recalled and the business having been arranged on other terms, the matter ends here.  We say the letters still exist and are public knowledge and until they are officially withdrawn or disavowed or repudiated any party has a right to go to Treasury and claim a Special Survey of 20,000 or more acres, tender his 10% and take his Excellency’s three months’ grace to pay the balance, subject to the forfeiture of the deposit in the event of failure.  If he were met with a refusal, he would be justified in charging the Government with a want of good faith.  Mischief may yet ensue from this want of firmness in the executive.

We hope the Government will indicate the positive course it will pursue on all future claims of a large Special Survey and will withdraw the quasi-gambling letters, which issued from the Colonial Secretary’s office on the 15 August.

[The paper then goes on to congratulate the Government on extricating itself from an awkward position and the successful parties for having obtained their objective.  It urges caution however, as they have only done so by withdrawing their capital from other more legitimate pursuits.  It warns that the Bank of SA continues to embargo discounts and accommodation, which may yet cause great inconvenience in the coming months and warns of the wages and transport costs that will have to be paid in advance of sales, with a bank that is unwilling to make the usual advances.  In short it wishes them success, while urging caution.]
