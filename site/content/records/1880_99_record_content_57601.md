The Chief Inspector of the Central Board of Health, Mr Farrell, visited Burra a few days ago.  After a thorough inspection he was almost entirely satisfied.  His only real complaint was the boiling of offal etc. at the premises of Messrs Rabbich & Sons, butchers, without any of the precautions required by the Health Act to prevent the escape of offensive fumes etc.  This is not a new complaint and has been before the Local Board of Health on different occasions.  Too much praise cannot be given to Mr J.R. Gray, the local Corporation Inspector, for the admirable way he looks after the sanitary condition of the town.
