Letter.  Courtney Tippet, Secretary of the Goyder YAC says that kids feel out of the way on ‘The Creek’.  They are being branded just for hanging out in a safe social circle, when it is clear that not everyone is causing trouble.  What Burra needs to do is to provide ‘a location that is facilitated for young people, and then the entire noise and conflict will no longer be imposed of the people of Burra and its visitors.
