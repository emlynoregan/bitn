Obituary.  Mr Ted Baulderstone, Burraâ€™s last Mayor before the amalgamation of the Corporation of Burra with the District Council in 1969, died last week.  He was a staunch community man who, in his last years, concentrated his energies on his love of history and heritage.  His untiring energy in support of Paxton Square will long be remembered.

[Edward Thomas Baulderstone, born 1 September 1904, Clarence Park: died 30 April 1987, Elizabeth.]
