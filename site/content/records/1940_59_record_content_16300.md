‘The Gums’ a station of about 74,000 acres belonged for a long time to Mr N.H. Pearse and before that to Hiles Pearse and later to the late Tom Pearse & Sons.  It was sold by auction on Friday at the Adelaide Wool Exchange and was bought by a well-known Pastoral Company at 9/- per acre.  Previously run in conjunction with ‘The Gums’ was ‘Glenbower’.  This property of 17,000 acres was sold to Herbert Hatherly for 10/- per acre.  (Located c. 10 miles north of Bower Railway Siding.)
