SA Underwater Training School has been in Burra for seven years, but its director, Martin Phillips says government subsidies were needed to retain courses and interest in the industry.  The school provides international accreditation under the Australian Diving Accreditation Scheme.  After a two month training course graduates could almost be guaranteed a job earning up to $50,000 immediately, but at c. $8,000 the course was too costly.  They could be training up to 36 students a year, but are currently running only two courses per annum, turning out 12 students.  At this rate the schoolâ€™s prospects of continuing for more than a couple of years seem slim.  [Photo.]
