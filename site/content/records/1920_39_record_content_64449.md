Memories of Burra by Elizabeth A. Ward

Mr Coglin and the Billys

One of the best loved and longest to be remembered is Mr Coglin.  Possessed of a genial warm heart this man dearly loved a joke – he was known to everyone.  He was a great lover of children and always carried lollies, one of which he presented to each child he met.  He had a flag pole in his garden which on his daughter’s birthday he would decorate with the Australian flag for his daughter, the French flag for Mrs Coglin, who was of French extraction, and the Irish flag for himself.  On Queen Victoria’s birthday and that of the Prince of Wales (Edward VII) he would run them all up, the Union Jack proudly topping the pole.

Nearly everyone kept goats in those days.  Flocks of them grazed on the hills and many small boys owned Billys.  These they drove in carts made of a box with wheels and shafts.  Billy would be harnessed and put into the shafts.  The boys were very proud of these animals.  They were usually very docile and seemed pleased to be handled.  The boys would also ride them.  I do not think they had individual names.  They were just known as ‘Joe’, ‘Tom’ or ‘Dick’ so-n-so’s Billy.

On holiday occasions, Mr Coglin held ‘billy-goat races’.  They were run on the piece of land on which Mr C. Wilkinson’s house now stands.  The prizes were usually lollies.  Once it was marbles.  Ten or twelve boys would enter for the race.  Mr Coglin would be starter and judge.  These races caused great amusement.  Sometimes a Billy would turn sulky, then no amount of persuasion could move him.  He would plant his forelegs firmly on the ground, then he would buck up his hind ones with a vicious kick and fling the rider over his head.  If he was ‘sporty’ he would buck and prance until he tired of the game.  Mr Coglin owned a ‘Billy’.  He once promised him to the boy who could catch him and could ride him.  The boys chased and chased, but catch Billy they could not.  This Mr Coglin knew.  Miss Coglin, whose birthday it was, was standing watching the proceedings.  She called Billy who ran to her and she held the horns waiting until a boy would venture to mount him.  As he saw a boy approach ‘Billy’ knocked Miss Coglin over on her back and ran for his life.

Entertainments used to be held in a large room at Lamb’s Hotel.  (Now the Men’s Ward at the Burra Hospital.)  On one occasion a ventriloquist with his ‘boy’ was performing.  This boy he questioned

“What is it that jumps fences into people’s gardens?”

Answer – “Coglin’s goats”.

“I saw this evening an army with fixed bayonets come down the hill and what were they.”

Answer – “Coglin’s goats”.

Mr Coglin, who was there, was so annoyed that he shook his fist at the man.  The fixed bayonets were the goats’ horns.

Mr Coglin also possessed a very talkative magpie.  He pronounced words and sounds that he knew so clearly, that it was thought a human being was speaking.  On one Good Friday two storekeepers, Mr T. Parks and Mr Georgie Morris, were taking a stroll past Mr Coglin’s house.  Suddenly a cry rang out, “Apple ho, Apple ho”.  The men were so startled that they stood still.  “Well I’m blessed if that isn’t Ward selling apples to-day”, said Mr Parks.  Mr Coglin, hidden by the fence, was in his garden enjoying the joke.  The magpie had so thoroughly imitated my father’s voice and call.

At Mr Coglin’s funeral, 500 children headed the procession.  He is buried in the Kooringa Cemetery.  Miss Louise Coglin still resides in her old home in Kooringa.
