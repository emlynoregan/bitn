Burra Housing.  At a recent Council meeting the Mayor said it was time to again approach the SA Housing Trust.  There had been no action and people were still seeking houses in the town.  Id nothing was done commercial travellers, tradesmen and intending residents would bypass the town.  Businesses in the town were having trouble retaining tradesmen because of the lack of satisfactory housing.  Mr Hawker MP will be asked to take up the matter with the SA Housing Trust.

RSL, Air Force Assoc., Fathersâ€™ Assoc. and the district Council will be approached about a united deputation to the Premier on the matter.
