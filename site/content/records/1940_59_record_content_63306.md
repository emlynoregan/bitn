Municipal Elections

So far no one has come forward to stand for Mayor.

Cr Baulderstone is not standing again for East Ward and whether he can be persuaded to stand for Mayor is a moot point.

Cr Samuel of West Ward has resigned unexpectedly due to his removal from the town, creating an extraordinary vacancy.

Burra Town Council has decided to eliminate the cork elms in Chapel St that are causing big problems with suckers.

Field Days are in full swing in the district.  At Collinsville on 20 April 143 rams were penned and a high price of 1,200 guineas was paid for one by Keith Richardson of Minnelup, WA.  Others went for 1,000 and 800 guineas.

21 rams were sold by Messrs J.B. Rayner & Sons of ‘The Bluff’ Hallett at up to 150 guineas each.

Messrs Ashby of Ashgrove sold 66 rams at 20-200 guineas.

Koonoona Field Day is 27 April and Mr Murray Thomas of ‘Stradbroke’ has one on 29 April and East Bungaree will hold its on 30 April.
