Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting

The largest meeting we have ever seen of ratepayers was held on Thursday to hear the views of the retiring Mayor and Cr Jennison, the two candidates for Mayor and also to hear the candidates for North & East Wards.  Mr A.B. Riggs was elected to the chair.

The Mayor read his report for 1933, which was adopted.

The Mayor then gave his address, making no apology for seeking ratepayers’ support in the coming elections.  His report and the financial state of Council though, should hardly make this necessary.  This might be the last chance the people had to elect a Mayor, as the Government was preparing a Bill which would change Corporations and have Mayors elected by the Council, like the Chairmen of District Councils.  This would lead to their being only five Councillors, to trickery, cliques and selfishness.  This time he said he was not fighting ratepayers, but the local branch of the RSL.  Cr Dow, their Secretary, was campaign leader for Cr Jennison and their President, Vice-President and Secretary were all present.  They had been writing letters to the press.  Eleven years ago when he first stood for Council Burra had no modern roads, public conveniences, a decent water supply or electric light and plenty of dust.  (A voice said . . . still got the dust.)  He could not claim credit for modernising the town, but he had played his part.  In 1923 council had decided to construct the main roads when he was Chairman of Public Works and he had prepared nearly all plans and specifications needed by Public Works Committee with his knowledge as a builder and contractor.  Cr Jennison had been a Councillor for three years only and was never on the Public Works Committee.  He had welcomed many prominent people to the town irrespective of politics or position.  In 1931 he promised a reduction in the assessment of rates, a cut in salaries and the practice of economy.  He had asked the Government to receive a Disabilities Committee of Unemployment and also concerning Mongolata.  He had carried out his promises.  Ratepayers had been saved £1,413-17-0.  His work as Mayor had brought £10,000 into the district, which had been spent in the last two years.  The support of Council had been consistent till Cr Jennison decided to stand for Council.  A few weeks ago Cr Jennison had told Council to let Mt Bryan look after Mongolata, Council refusing to send a letter of thanks to The News for £50 received for help of the unemployed.  Some were also writing a stream of rubbish about ‘Johnny Green’ holding it up to ridicule and suggesting it as a mascot for Mayoral Cars.  The statement it might cause drunken drivers to crash was a lot of rot.  ‘Johnny Green’ was a relic of prosperity and peace of one of the most famous copper mines in the world and was as important to him as the guns which had been repainted and inscribed at public expense.  If ratepayers thought the time had come to throw in the towel concerning unemployment they were wrong.  Thousands were still out of work.  The Government wanted work done, but at this time of the year only painting and kalsomining was available and what could they give to the unskilled?  The town had eleven years of his record to judge and he had neither the time nor the energy for a press campaign.

When Cr Jennison rose to speak the Mayor left the platform for some time.

[54, 48, 29 Nov. 1933, page 2: Any inference that the Mayor’s actions in leaving the platform during Mr Jennison’s speech at the Ratepayers’ Meeting was an intended discourtesy is incorrect and after the explanation made to us we are sure such was not the intention.]

Cr Jennison felt keenly the unkind remarks of the Mayor.  He however, intended to stick to his policy of fair play.  He was not being backed by the RSL and even if he were this was no different to the Mayor being backed by his admirers.  Mr Dow was certainly helping him, but otherwise the League was not involved.  The Mayor’s remarks suggest that but for him the town and Mongolata would have been neglected.  All members of the Council had worked hard and were entitled to share credit with the Mayor.  He was not responsible for the letter in the paper two weeks earlier, while ‘Ratepayer’ the following week was no doubt by one of his admirers.  He had every regard for Mongolata and had been among the first to invest in it.  He congratulated the Mayor on the latter’s work to find relief for the men out there and he and other Councillors had assisted the Mayor in that.  As for the money from The News.  It had gone directly to the Mayor and been distributed without consultation with the Council, so how could the Mayor expect Council to write thanks for a matter they had nothing to do with officially.  If anyone deserved credit for the restoration and erection of ‘Johnny Green’ it was Cr March, but he like other Councillors saw no need for a special function to mark the event.  He was flattered to accept the request to stand and his decision was in part influenced by the Government’s move to change the way that Mayors would be elected.  As a Councillor he had done his work without fear or favour.  As a member of the Finance Committee he could speak with authority on the financial difficulties of the Council.  The Council had not let slip any chance of securing relief funds as a result of untiring efforts by all members of Council and the capable assistance of the Town Clerk.  As for Mongolata, though it was not in the Council’s territory, the Council had done many things for it and the Mayor had taken all the credit and not given sufficient where due to other Councillors.  He could not foresee any relief for ratepayers given demands on the Council and much of what had been achieved was due to extra relief monies obtained.  There was so far no sign the Government would make Christmas relief funds available this year.  The Mayor’s casting vote had turned down a scheme that would have given many of the unemployed some relief for Christmas and the Mayor had so far not presented another workable scheme for consideration – a fact he regretted.

He favoured the preservation of the parks and trees and replanting where needed; attention to the cemetery and Fire Brigade.  He would favour reduction of the rate when it could be done without sacrificing standards.

The Mayor in reply referred to the many laudatory comments on his work in the paper and to the expenses he incurred in entertaining visiting officials and to the long and honourable connection of the family with the town.  He made reference to his late brother Robert who was the first Burra boy on active service in France in 1914 and the first Burra boy to give his life for his country*, and to his grandfather who had brought the big engine to Burra.  The money from The News had been split equally between the needy men of Burra and Mongolata.  He objected to borrowing money given the present high rates of interest.  He produced various items of correspondence from the Minister of Industry and others, but the point being made was not really clear.  He said Cr March had said some old resident might like to make a reunion of the erection of ‘Johnny Green’ and invite P.A. McBride to perform the ceremony, but Councillors had voted against acknowledging that gentleman’s generosity.  He took up the RSL’s role again, but was cut off by the chair as it had been covered.

[*This assertion is something of an exaggeration.  Robert Woollacott may have been the first to die in France (on 28 September 1915), but in Gallipoli and the Middle East earlier deaths were: A.E. Egan 25 April 1915, H.W. Skinner 2 May 1915, J. Camp 15 May 1915, C.A. Kuchenmeister 5 September 1915 and P.D. Killicoat 19 September 1915.]

Roy Jeffery, candidate for North Ward made a short speech saying he would do his best and work for the benefit of the town.

F.T. Sara said he was standing in response to a deputation and would also do his best for the town.  Stan Kellaway, standing for East Ward, referred to his nine years’ previous experience.  He was also a member of the Burra High School Council, Burra State School Committee, the Hospital Board of Management and Secretary of the Unemployed Relief Council.  [He essentially stood on his record.]

C. Lott would do his best for Ward and town.

R.J. Bernhardt asked Cr Bevan why the creek on Cow Dung Hill had not been repaired.  Cr Bevan said he did not know of such a creek.  Cr Jennison said it had been repaired once or twice, but storm waters washed it out.

C. Lynch asked if all Councillors were financial in regard their rates.  The Chairman disallowed the question.

Mr M.W. Bednall was confused regarding the various schemes for unemployment relief suggested by the Mayor and Cr Jennison at the recent Council meeting.  The Mayor said the Government had put forward various schemes: one would subsidise Council expenditure 75% for tree planting and beautifying the ground, another offered loan money at 3½%.  Bills for these two had not yet passed the Legislative Council.  To borrow money the Council needed ratepayer approval.

Cr Jennison said there was no proposal to borrow money.  It was intended the Council spend £25, attracting £75 from the Government to enable £100 worth of work.  The Government said men could take either rations and the 25% cash from Council or take it all in cash.  But the proposal was turned down by the Mayor’s casting vote.

M. Tiddy asked if ‘Johnny Green’ was to get any inscription.  The Mayor said he did not know of any.

Alfred Walker asked the Chairman’s permission to explain the origin of ‘Johnny Green’.
