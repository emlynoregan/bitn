The Booborowie Correspondent says it is time they had a post office.  The roads are so bad that the mail is often hopelessly delayed.  Recently it left the Copperhouse Inn at the time it was due at Booborowie and then got lost.  A person with a light had to pilot it back to the correct road.  On the track further north the next day it became evident that it travelled directly only on mile in 16 and the rest in a zigzag fashion.  On the way it dropped into a gutter where it lost the centre pin. Leaving the front wheels only attached to the horses.  It eventually reached Canowie.  The bad placed made by the floods are now getting worse.
