P. Lane felt the Waterworks could be worked more cheaply by the corporation than by the Government and he therefore moved:

‘That the Town Council be empowered to make arrangements with the Government respecting the whole matter and that the Mayor should endeavour to get the original cost of construction and how it was made.’  Carried.

He hoped the Mayor could elicit from the Government how costs got to £8,500 although guaranteed not to be [more] than £3,500.

W.H. Vivian asked who had to pay, as he did not need it having a good well and pump.  The mayor replied that all would have to pay if the main passed his door.

W.T. Rabbich moved as an amendment that a committee be set up to go into the matter, but the amendment was lost.

John Jenkins said the promotion of the original scheme has said that the Waterworks would not become a burden to the community and those who did not use it would not have to pay.  Now one man in his street uses it and pays 25/- for the privilege and yet he, who does not use it, has to pay 37/6 just for having the main pass his door.

P. Lane said if the Government had kept their promise to take the water the Council would not have been placed in the present position.

J. Snell thought the scheme’s promoters deserved a leather medal.

W.T. Rabbich moved: ‘That the Government be informed that the ratepayers are not satisfied with the high rate as gazetted.’  Passed
