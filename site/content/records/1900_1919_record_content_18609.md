Mr ‘Watty’ Truscott has fitted a cool storage room to keep beef, mutton, lamb, pork, sausages etc. for a month if necessary.  We inspected it recently and were glad to get into the warm weather again.  Little meat will now be kept in the shop window or even in the shop.  Customers will be served direct from the cool chamber.
