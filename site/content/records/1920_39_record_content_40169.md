The Mayor’s Report for 1931

The general account started in debit £108-7-5 and ended in debit £117.  Little was done about the parklands, cemetery or with the Local Board of Health this year.  Main roads are in good order and were top dressed with slag this year except for the road from the Black Bridge to the east.  The major public works for the year were the remaking of the Young St Ford, the making of the road to the school, the repair of several bridges and maintenance of a number of footpaths.  Employees were reduced to two.  J.H. Rosewall was dispensed with after 16 years service and scavenging was let by tender to Mr Hill.

During the year distinguished visitors were the Hon. Premier Mr L.L. Hill & Mrs Hill, the Chief Secretary Mr S.R. Whitford, Hon. R.S. Richards Minister for Mines and Dr Ward & Mr Gepp who produced a report on Mongolata.

A financial statement is then printed.
