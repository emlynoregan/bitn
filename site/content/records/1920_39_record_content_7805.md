The Hanson-Booborowie Railway

A meeting at the Booborowie Memorial Hall 22 May was attended by Messrs Morrow MLC, W. Hawke & G.F. Jenkins MPs and a large gathering of residents.  I J. Warnes took the chair.  Mr Morrow said he appreciated the need for a railway and that the 1910 report had said one was justified and the standing committee had recommended a guaranteed line be built.  In 1915 the Bill was introduced and read a second time and in 1916 it was re-introduced, but failed to get through the Legislative Council.  In 1917 the Bill was again on the Notice Paper for £163,000, but estimated costs rose to £181,000 and it was sent back to the standing committee.  Mr Hawke saw the need for the line to encourage the dairy industry.  Mr Jenkins said the standing committee needed assurance that the line would pay.  Steel costs had fallen lately and the residents should make a strong case based on that and on the increase in lucerne production and the potential for dairying.  A deputation to wait on the Government was formed.
