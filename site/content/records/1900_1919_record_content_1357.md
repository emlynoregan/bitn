Burra Literary Soc. held a ‘Patriotic Evening’ last Wednesday.  It opened with The Song of Australia, then Mrs Holden gave an address on The Queen which was followed by God Save the Queen and Unfurl the Flag.  Next was a recitation: England Goes to Battle which was followed by Kipling’s song Absent Minded Beggar.  Mr Drew then spoke on The Lion and the Kangaroo Soldiers of the Queen: an address on the bravery of the Colonial troops and their independence of action and thought.  This was followed by a recitation: Britains Sons will Do or Die and the song The Englishman.  A speech: The Leaders in the Field came next, followed by the song, Adieu Marie, and the National Anthem concluded the program.
