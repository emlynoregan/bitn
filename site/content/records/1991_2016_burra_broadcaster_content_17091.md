The Great SA Bike Ride brought 450 visitors to Burra on Monday afternoon, after a fairly hot ride from Eudunda.  After settling in at Burra Oval many returned to Market Square for food and live music.  ‘Breaker Morant’ was screened at the Redruth Gaol in the evening – where some of its scenes were shot.  Most riders were off to Clare before 9 a.m. on Tuesday, to try to escape the heat.  The riders came with a vast support network of at least three semi-trailers, two covered trucks, vans with toolboxes and repair kits etc. and a travelling café.  Overnight the oval was covered with pup tents.
