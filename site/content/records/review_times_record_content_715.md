The Uniting Church in Australia will be inaugurated in the Burra Parish in a service of worship at Burra Church at 10 a.m. on 26 June.  Many people including children have made banners for the occasion and after the service there will be a procession along the main street.  The procession will enter St Joseph’s Church where the Catholic Priest Fr Kenny and his congregation will be asked to join the pilgrimage and share lunch at the Uniting Church Hall.  The company will meet the Lutheran Pastor on the way and proceed to St Mary’s Church to invite Fr B. May and the Anglican congregation to join in the celebrations.
