Regional Council of Goyder

Mayor Peter Mattey has written to the Health Minister John Hill highlighting residents’ concerns over the downgrading of the Eudunda and Burra Hospitals to GP Plus Emergency facilities.  The letter points out the additional costs to patients and families should they need to travel to a Hub Hospital at Clare or Pt Pirie, the social cost, the additional time it will take to get medical aid and the additional burden placed on Eudunda and Burra Ambulance services.  The letter says it seems inevitable that Burra and Eudunda Hospitals will lose their ability to offer hospital based acute care.  The threat to the towns’ ability to attract and retain GPs was also listed.
