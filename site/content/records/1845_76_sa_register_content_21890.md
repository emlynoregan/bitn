[Central Road Board, 21 April] Stationmen.

[There is an article reporting on a discussion at the Central Road Board concerning the possibility of discontinuing the position of stationmen along the main roads.  They were men employed to look out for maintenance problems along the road and to see to immediate repairs.  The alternative seems to have been to employ a fewer number of overseers who would have had much longer stretches of road to supervise, but who would have engaged local labour to attend to maintenance and not have done any of the work themselves.  The stationmen also engaged labour, but also did some of the work themselves.  The overseers would have received about twice the salary of the stationmen.]
