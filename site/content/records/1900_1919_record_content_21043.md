As far as Burra is concerned there is no industry in progress that would promise better times ahead.  The mine is still inactive and likely to stay so.  Despite hearing of a change of ownership and a substantial deposit put down, arrival of boring plants, no satisfactory work has resulted.  We would not be surprised to hear of work being abandoned in the near future.  Morphett’s Shaft was retimbered and a start was about to be made to unwater the mine when copper prices slumped from £104 to under £70 per ton.  Work was curtailed and the men at the shaft were laid off.
