Heritage Status

There is a proposal before Federal Parliament to dramatically reduce the 13,000 places on the register of the National Estate to several hundred that are of ‘truly’ national heritage significance on a new National Heritage List.

In SA there are hundreds of places on the National Register that are not on the State Register.  The Town of Burra is on both the Federal and State Lists.  The town is one of 14 such sites listed as a State Heritage Area and numerous individual buildings in Burra are listed in their own right on both the State and National Registers.

The Goyder Heritage Advisory Committee has recommended to Council that Federal Minister for Environment and Heritage, Senator Hill, be lobbied to make sure Burra retains its National Heritage listing.  Goyder Council Planning Officer John Brak said it seems clear the Federal Government’s aim is to cull the list to avoid responsibility for funding the conservation of places of national significance – devolving that responsibility to the States.  The State meanwhile is doing a similar thing by urging local governments to create their own lists of local heritage places.  National Trust Chairperson Maureen Wright said we should be lobbying for the Federal Government to use the present list as a basis for any pruning rather than to start again with a clean sheet.  It would be a good idea for the local council to have a heritage list as it would give it an advantage in attracting funding that might be available for State listed properties.
