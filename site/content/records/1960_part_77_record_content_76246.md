Mr Allen MP speaking in Parliament, said that in areas controlled by the Commonwealth Railways people wished they were under the SAR for its better service, but in SAR areas people thought the Commonwealth did it better.  He was concerned about railway workers’ housing.  He was afraid Peterborough’s railway workshops would be relocated to Pt Augusta to the detriment of the town and the Premier can offer no assurance that with the transfer of SAR to Commonwealth this will not happen.  The Town Clerk of Peterborough has, however, received an assurance from the Premier that there is a provision ‘that there should be no reduction in the level of employment of railway workshops, without prior agreement with the State Government.
