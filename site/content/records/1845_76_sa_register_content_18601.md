Springfield-Steelton-Black Springs-Long Hill-Springbank-Aberdeen.  32 miles 42 chains.

Springfield-Steelton-Black Springs-Karkulto Mine-Langmead’s-Sod Hut Ranges-Kooringa-Aberdeen.  33 miles 65 chains.

Comments:

2 is the shortest, but with two steep gradients (one of 1:14 for 19 chains and one of 1:22 for 65 chains) and it leaves Kooringa off the main road.

5 is the next shortest, but has the same objections as No. 2 except for taking in Black Springs.

3 is the next shortest, but with the same objections and it leaves Black Springs to the west.

6 avoids Long Hill and passes through both Black Springs and Kooringa.

1 & 4 are almost the same length.  1 has been the road usually used as the main road and c. 2¾ miles is already metalled with side ditches for drainage from Springfield to Apoinga.

The old road is best for water and the middle or western road takes in the largest amount of agricultural land.

The plans were presented.

The matter was then adjourned to the next meeting.
