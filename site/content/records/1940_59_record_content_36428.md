Weather.  The dry spell of more than three months has broken with good falls of 140 to 271 points across a wide area of the agricultural and pastoral lands of the district.  Burra received 180 points, Gum Creek 270, Leighton 250, Booborowie district about 200 and Hallett 124.  To 9 a.m. Sunday falls to the east of up to 80 points were reported, before the telephone line was cut, but more has fallen since.  The dry earth has soaked up the rain and little if any run-off has entered dams.
