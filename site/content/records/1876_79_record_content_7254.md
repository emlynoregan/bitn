Burra Town Council.

The Town Clerk is to apply for a road to the cemetery and along its western side and also for the banks of the creek from opposite the school to the new bridge, for tree planting. Cr Ridgway moved that steps be taken for the sale of all property on which rates had not been paid. Cr Geake moved an amendment that it be postponed till legal advice re costs had been obtained. Both motion and amendment were lost.

Cr Drew moved the Town Clerk take advice as necessary for the sale of vacant lands on which the rates remained unpaid.

It was resolved that Captain Killicoat be charged £3 per acre plus expenses for the piece of closed road to be sold to him.
