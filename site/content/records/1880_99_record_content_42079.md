Ling How was charged by Drew & Crewes with stealing a bag of rice valued at 13/- on 12 August.  He pleaded not guilty.  Found guilty and sentenced to 3 months hard labour in Redruth Gaol.  The day before the trial was due Ling said he would pay for the rice as he didnâ€™t have time to go to gaol.  He failed to appear at the trial and a warrant was issued for his arrest.  He was taken into custody at Terowie on Monday by M-C Davis and tried the next day.
