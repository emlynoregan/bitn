Fire.  On New Year’s Day a fire broke out in Mr E. Jettner’s crop at Leighton during harvesting.  Fire fighters were soon on the scene and about 200 men attended.  About 80 acres of stubble burnt, 20 acres of standing crop and 100 bags of wheat.  A wind change saved the homestead and sheds.  Mr Jettner’s header was badly burned and so was his tractor.
