Obituary.  Mrs Caroline Launder died at Sunset Lodge Adelaide 19 June.  She was a former Burra resident who was born in Redruth, Cornwall, in 1838 and so was 97 when she died.  As Miss Caroline Wells she married Mr Burt and on his death in 1872, with her only son George, came to SA.  In the same year she married Mr James Launder and the couple came to Burra.  Their first home was in Paxton Square and later Mr Launder built a home in lower Bridge Terrace where they lived till Mr Launder’s death.  In 1921 she moved to the city to live with friends and later to Sunset Lodge near Mitcham.  Though she was very frail she retained a wonderful mentality to the end and many Burra folk continued to visit her.  Her son died some years ago and at her funeral in Kooringa on Thursday three grandchildren were present: Mr Reg. Burt of Broadview, Mr Les. Burt of Nailsworth and Lily Mrs J.F. Scott of Reade Park.  Mrs Burt’s youngest daughter, Stella Mrs S. Tressida resides in Melbourne.  There are six grandchildren.

[Died 18 June 1935 at Mitcham aged 96.  She married James Launder at the Bible Christian Manse Kooringa 10 August 1875.]
