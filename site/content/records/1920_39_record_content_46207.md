About 37 years ago he carried the mail between Hallett and Ketchowla for three years.  As a young man he did much colt breaking and was a good horseman.

In 1907 he got a block on Petherton and carried on farming there with two sons till his death.  He took a keen interest in sport and was starter for the local Athletic Club for about 30 years.  He succumbed to kidney trouble over the last three months.  He was a long-time member of the Oddfellows’ Lodge.  A widow, two sons, three daughters and an only brother survive.
