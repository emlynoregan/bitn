The Inspector reported various offences – notably that on 14 May Mr McKenna of Broken Hill had crashed into the Mine Bridge breaking the northeast corner.  He has the name and address of the driver who asked that the account be sent to him.

The plan for a bridge near Finch’s (beyond the cemetery) was laid on the table.  It will do so for a fortnight, as the Inspector of Roads and Bridges would have to approve and he was due about then.

Cr Riggs moved to rescind permission for W.O. James to fence off the north end of Creek St and a gate to be placed there.  Fences to be placed on the proper boundary.

Cr Woollacott moved that fences concerned in the recent subdivision of Grahamstown be placed on the correct boundaries and tenders called for same.  Carried.

Various minor works approved.

Concerning the croquet Ground:

Cr Riggs said Mrs Sara said that in all probability the club would be able to secure the adjacent blocks to that granted by the Council.  The Club wanted to know if they could do so whether the Council would act as trustees for the property.  He so moved and Cr Woollacott seconded.

Cr Pearce pointed out the Club would need a lease.  Carried with the proviso the Council be put to no expense and the Club pay the rates and taxes.

Consideration of the Council buying motor traction was deferred indefinitely on account of lack of funds.

It was agreed to try as an experiment allotting each ward £300 instead of 75% of rates raised in the ward.  Maintenance money to be allocated as needed.  Carried.
