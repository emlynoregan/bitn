NOTE.

Throughout 1941 there were regular and often quite detailed reports of the monthly meetings and associated activities of many of the patriotic societies.  These have not generally been noted.  They are very repetitive.  Where special fundraising activities were undertaken they have been noted.  The District Council has also not generally been noted.  Most of its reports are concerned with uninteresting correspondence, changes in ownership of real property and road or drainage works of a fairly minor nature.  Also not noted were regular reports of the class positions or internal sporting activities of the Burra Primary and High Schools.

The following Red Cross Branches fall under the above note: Burra, Burra North, Hanson, Willalo, Hallett, Leighton, Booborowie, and Mt Bryan.

The following Fighting Forces Comfort Fund units also fall under this note:
