Obituary.  Ronald Edward Dewhirst BEM.  8 May 1908 to 3 March 2001

Ron was born in Broken Hill, the eldest child of Charles Dewhirst and Elsie nee Baynes.  As a young fellow he worked as a Broken Hill Mining Co.’s office boy who went underground for five years.  He was sent bush at the age of 19 to recuperate from a serious motorcycle accident, working as a timber cutter, stationhand and a mail van driver.  He was also an assistant at Booborowie General Store, then owned by Allan & Les Pearce.  There he took on bookkeeping.  He studied for three years and passed his Certificate of Proficiency in 1936.  In 1933 he married Elsie McMillan if Adelaide.  They had three children – Betty, John and Alan.  When his employers’ business took him to outlying properties he picked up jobs helping farmers with their books and tax.  In 1947 he joined to Taxation Institute and three years later established his own firm with his son John and 40 clients.  In the 1970s he was awarded a British Empire Medal for service to the community and especially for his involvement with swimming.  He was always closely involved with the church; initially with the Congregational Church in Broken Hill and in Booborowie with the Methodist/Uniting Church and more recently with the Westbourne Park Uniting Church.  Elsie’s illness caused the move to Adelaide in 1986 to Resthaven at Kingswood.  He continued to serve a reduced clientele from his Pirie Street Office until forced to retire due to a stroke in 1999.  He will be remembered for his generosity, faith and a keen sense of humour.  Sport played a large part in his life and he was also much involved with the Masonic Lodge for many years.
