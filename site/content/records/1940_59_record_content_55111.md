Burra School.  The contractor, Mr G. Stevens, has again failed to begin the promised work on the schoolyard.  There is a new promise he will inspect the site on 18 June.  The contract was let in December 1949.  The Education Department advised on March 25 this year that the work would begin within a fortnight.
