Burra Racing Club has made a number of improvements to the course for this year.  The western wing of the Totalisator room has been removed and the materials used to build a Jockeys’ Room and Secretary’s Office adjacent to the Saddling Paddock.  This makes for more comfortable accommodation for riders.  This frees an area under the grandstand, most of which will now be available for the CWA ladies, who will provide luncheon on race day.  The track badly needs rain.  The straight and as much of the course as can be watered looks well.  74 nominations have been received for the meeting on 8 April.
