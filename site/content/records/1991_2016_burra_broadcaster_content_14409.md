The Rescue 1 Bell Jet Ranger Helicopter was called to Burra to retrieve an Adelaide lady who suffered a heart attack while visiting relatives.  Just after take-off a mechanical fault caused it to land again and the patient had to be transferred to Adelaide by ambulance.  The helicopter will be in Burra until later in the week before repairs can be effected.
