‘American’ Plan Proposed for Burra’s Main Street

Recently the Shadow Minister for the Arts suggested that the American ‘Main Street’ program would be suitable for Burra.  On a visit to Adelaide recently the President of the American Institute of Architects, Ms Mary Means, held a seminar about this concept.  It aims at gaining wider community support for heritage conservation while developing the centre into a tourist and commercial centre.  In the plan a trained advisor would use the skills of professionals to help local traders and shop owners to develop a unique heritage image for the shopping centre, which would make the most of existing heritage buildings.  Programs would aim to promote the whole street rather than individual shops.  A trust could be established to preserve the heritage buildings and simultaneously to develop the commercial and tourist potential of the street.  The trust would use the existing conservation studies as well as taking advice from historians, heritage advisers and architects.  It would seek to make agreements with owners of buildings so that no unsightly or unauthorised alterations or developments took place.  The cost of such a project would initially be about $20,000 p.a. for which corporate or government sponsorship could be sought.  One or two shops per year could be restored so that there would be no dramatic change.  ‘Polly’s Teashop’ in the former Record office is an example of this type of preservation.  A revitalisation of Market Square would exploit and boost tourist trade.

The article was tabled at the June meeting of the Burra Burra DC, which was attended by the Head of the State Heritage Branch of the Department of Environment & Planning, Mr Jon Womersley.  He said the program had generally been introduced into towns with populations larger than 50,000.  He was asked what Ms Means thought about other heritage areas around the state.  He said she believed Pt Adelaide redevelopment was ‘sterile’ and Hahndorf was ‘kitsch’.

Mr Hawker said that in the end heritage would have to pay its way.  ‘But if the heritage character was destroyed by unwise activity the town would just become a handful of historical sites which was the case with Hahndorf, he said.’

Burra Traders Association would invite an expert from Adelaide to discuss the idea.  Cr Barton said the response of traders would most likely depend on what funding arrangements could be developed.

The Council has written to the Association expressing concern about the poor condition of some of the businesses and commercial premises in Burra.
