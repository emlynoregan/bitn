Mid North Games.

As part of the Games, Burra hosted the Little Athletics in April, when 200 children attended from 21 clubs, including 13 Adelaide clubs, 2 from Sale, Victoria and others from many SA Towns.  The Chess Tournament was held in the Burra Civic Centre 16-17 April and was the first time for many years that an SA Chess title event has been held outside Adelaide.
