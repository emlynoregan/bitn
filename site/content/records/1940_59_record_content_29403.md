Burra RSL New Clubrooms

The new rooms were officially opened by the Premier Hon. T. Playford on Saturday afternoon.  After the ceremony a stream of people inspected the clubrooms.  The consensus of opinion was that they contained every conceivable amenity to make the leisure time of returned men enjoyable and profitable.  The rooms are done out in cream and renovated by local contractors Messrs Carl Pearce and M. Woollacott.  They were declared open with only £400 owing on an expenditure totalling c. £3,000.  Further donations on the day reduced the balance owing to £238-14-0.  A huge crowd gathered on Saturday to watch the opening ceremony.  President Fuller called upon the Premier to perform the ceremony.

[His speech and that of the Premier are printed.]

Mr Dalwood represented the RSL in SA on behalf of the State President.  Mr R.H. Smith made an appeal for donations to wipe out the £400 owing.  [Respondents to this appeal are listed.]
