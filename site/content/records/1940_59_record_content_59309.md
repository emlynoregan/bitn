Burra High School held its Coronation Ceremony in the Assembly Hall on Monday.  A large number of adults also attended.  Mr G.S. Hawker unveiled a tinted portrait of the Queen.  The assembly listened to a Coronation Broadcast by the Governor of SA, Sir Robert George.  Mr G.S. Hawker gave a speech in which he recalled listening to the previous Coronation Broadcast on the American liner SS Monterey on their way to New York.

The New Testaments and Gospels had not arrived, so the Mayor gave a short address.  Russell Harris, as Head Prefect, read an address on the ‘Keynote of Loyalty to the Queen.’  Senior Girl Prefect, Coralie Ellis read the Queen’s Declaration of Dedication on her 21st birthday.  A general declaration of loyalty was followed by a film on historic occasions in the Queen’s life.  26 trees were planted on the flat below the tennis court in honour of the Coronation Year.
