Alfred Allen was sued by Messrs Ewins & Sons for debt.  He acknowledged the debt, but was unable to pay having a wife and eight children to support.  He said he had illness in the house and it took more than he could earn to make ends meet.  He offered 1/- a week and an order was made for 2/- a week.
