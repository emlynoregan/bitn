Burra Welfare Committee held its final Welcome Home to Service Personnel in the Burra Town Hall on Friday night.  The hall was fairly well crowded.  There were about thirty servicemen and women on the stage for the Mayor’s speech.  [This is printed and is followed by remarks by Dr Steele, Mr L.H. Thomas (who spoke for Burra RSL) and Mr G. Dollman.]

Mr Jennison also took the occasion to congratulate the Mayor on receiving his decoration from the Governor during the week.  Mr Brian Riggs spoke for the returned service personnel and was supported by D. Humphrys and A.J. Hill.  Dancing continued to almost 1 a.m. to Darrell Field’s Orchestra.
