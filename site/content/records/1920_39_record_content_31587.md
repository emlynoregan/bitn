Burra Town Council, 5 August.

James Thomas President of the Benevolent Society has taken ‘Johnny Green’ in hand.

Captain Roberts of the Landing Grounds Campaign replied, but the letter did not give definite answers to questions and the Aero Club and Controller of Aviation will now be approached.

Council decided not to purchase a copy of the picture of the Menin Gate.

Council considered the need for a by-law to licence and control fresh fruit hawkers in the town.

Membership of the Automobile Assoc. was renewed, as it was believed they would place a guide in the town.
