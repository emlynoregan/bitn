In the moonlight the streets were busy again with throngs of pedestrians.  Only one accident was reported.  A man named Cundy, who had been ‘a little on the loose’ by some means got thrown from a trap near the Temperance Hotel and landed on his head with both wheels of the trap going over him.  Dr Brummitt saw the incident and attended and the victim is progressing.

Boxing Day was the great day with the United Friendly Societies’ Sports.  At dawn the wind was nasty with blowing dust, but later it eased off and became sultry.  The sports were a great success with a tremendous crowd and both the bicycle and foot races were better than usual for a country town.  The tracks were in good condition.  The fence around the busiest part of the wheel track was a great improvement.  The procession from the Institute was arranged.  A large gathering began at 9 a.m. and some 300 members of the three orders assembled in a long column two deep and marched to the hospital and then to the oval, reaching there shortly before 11 a.m.  During the day nearly 2,000 visited the oval.

The complete results are printed.

The main footrace was the Sheffield Handicap of 135 yards for £15 and was won by A. McDonald off 12 yards from S.W. Dickson off 13 yards, in 12.2 seconds.

R.D. Morton won the £10 first prize in the one-mile bicycle handicap.

In the evening a concert in the Institute saw a full house and proceeds were over £21.  The program was of the ordinary Christy Minstrel type, after which a ball saw dancing till the early hours.
