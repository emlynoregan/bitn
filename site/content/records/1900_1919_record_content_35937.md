Meeting of Businessmen re Saturday Half-Holiday.

This was held at The Institute on Thursday with E.W. Crewes in the chair.

For a long time the half-holiday on Wednesday had worked well, but gradually other towns had changed to Saturday and now the Kooringa store closed on Wednesday and the Aberdeen one on Saturday.  Then on Friday when there were [stock] sales the 6 p.m. closing time created an inconvenient rush.  Also with most holidays being on Mondays, Saturday closing was a convenience for workers.

Mr Pederson favoured Saturdays.  Mr Ridgway sent a letter lending his support to Saturday.  Mr Crewes said Mt Bryan and Hallett stores now closed on Wednesday, but would fall into line with Burra.  [Presumably he was speaking for Drew & Crewesâ€™ branches.]  F. Sara and Mr Hartnett also favoured Saturday.  A deputation was established to go to the Mayor to convene a public meeting to discuss the matter.
