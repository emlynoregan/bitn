Accident/Obituary

A boy named Turley met his death on Friday night by falling down a shaft at the Burra Burra Mine.  He was employed as a whim boy and was working a double shift in order to have a holiday the following day.  He seems to have lain down inside the fence around the shaft and fallen asleep.  When woken to commence work he either walked or rolled into the shaft and fell to the 40 fathom level.  An inquest was held at the Burra Burra Hotel by Dr Mayne.  Richard Goldsworthy said he was told at about 11.30 that the deceased had either walked or rolled into Graham’s Shaft.  Went with Henry Bastion and found the body at the 40 fathom level.  He was dead.  The shaft is fenced to prevent accidents and the boy’s work was 18 ft from the shaft.  He drives the whim.  Anyone can see the shaft and he had no business taking him to the shaft.  Joseph Sleep said he saw deceased about 11 p.m.  He and his boy sat down with the deceased for about a quarter of an hour.  I then ascertained he was inside the fence and told him to come out as it was dangerous.  Was not aware he had not come out until the knocker went.  I went to see if he was there and heard a kind of bustling noise, but no cry.  Suspected he had fallen in and sent my boy to tell Captain Dick.  I went below to find him, but Henry Bastion discovery the body first.

John Nankivell had been working at the 20 fathom level when he heard that a boy had fallen.  Went down to the 40 fathom and found Henry Bastion with the body.  When Captain Dick and Richard Bastion came we put deceased into a kibble and hauled him up.  W.R. Carmichael MD had looked at the body and said the immediate cause of death was concussion of the brain and a fractured skull and the left thigh bone was broken.  Death would have been instantaneous.  The verdict was accidental death.

[Thomas Turley died 25 January 1856 aged 12.  BISA adds Thomas Henry Turley and says he arrived with his family from Kent in 1848.]
