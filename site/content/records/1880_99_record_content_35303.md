Burra Town Council, 24 January.

The mayor reported on the inspection of the town.

On the whole the town is satisfactory and sanitary.  Watertables need clearing and as usual some footpaths, roads and drains need attention.  Butchers’ premises were inspected and were deemed acceptable.  In the North Ward pigs and sheep are slaughtered on site and some disagreeable smell is to be expected.  (In the other wards all slaughtering is off the premises.)

Hotels were inspected and some urinals needed attention.

An enlargement of the cemetery will be needed soon.

The reserve in North Ward that Councillors want trees planted on was inspected and deemed suitable for this and an arrangement for the funds needed has been made.

Council will send a deputation to the Hon. F.W. Holder to seek a reduction in the Waterworks interest from 5% to 3½%.

Cr O’Leary moved the troughs in the North Ward be left open and North Ward be charged 1/- per 1,000 gallons for the water used.

P.L. Killicoat has offered all piping, cocks etc. to lay water on to the oval on condition the Council finds the labour.  He was thanked and the matter left with the Waterworks Committee.

Races.  A meeting was held at the Commercial Hotel on Wednesday evening and it was decided to meet again tomorrow night to elect a committee etc. to run a race meeting at a date to be decided.

Bridge St Bridge.  If that bridge in Bridge St is not soon repaired it will collapse.  [Which of the two possible bridges is not clear.]

The Mt Bryan Fire killed 190 sheep and 1 horse.
