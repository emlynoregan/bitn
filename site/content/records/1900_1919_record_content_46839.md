Burra Hospital board, Last Thursday.

It was decided to switch from two telephones to one and to connect the isolation ward and get a switchboard.

The Chief Secretary acknowledged receipt of a letter from the Board re the town’s doctors.

Nurse McNeil has resigned as a probationer because both of her brothers had enlisted and she was needed at home.

The Chief Secretary expresses concern that the expenditure is exceeding the Government grant of £1,500 and thought more should come from paying patients.

Mr Harcus said the excess would be about £112.

The hospital financial year should be brought into line with the grant year running from 1 July to 30 June and it would be more even.  This will be done.

Patient contributions varied greatly from year to year.  There was a low of £242 in 1910 and a high of £726 in 1914 for instance.  The secretary thought that outstanding accounts should be placed in the hands of a solicitor.

Outstanding accounts totalled about £300.
