From ‘Templar’ re shop hours.  Three or four years ago the shopkeepers agreed to close earlier in the evening, but the old ways have gradually re-emerged with the changed in proprietors.  The writer believes shops were more consistently busy when they closed at 8 p.m. than they are now when closing at 10 p.m.  Some say they would do better closing at 6 p.m. all the year.  Why don’t they try it then?  The change would seem to benefit all.  There would be a saving in lighting oil, fewer fires, and more fresh air for workers, with the same business done.
