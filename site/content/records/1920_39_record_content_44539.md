Mongolata Goldfield

Work has recommenced after the Christmas break.

Prospectors and others eagerly await the completion of the battery.

Frank Treloar writes concerning drawings at the Art Gallery in Adelaide of the Burra Mine, the Smelting Works and Kooringa and with reference to photographs ordered taken before and after the open cut commenced which seem to have disappeared.
