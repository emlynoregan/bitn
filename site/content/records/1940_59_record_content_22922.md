Burra Centenary Photographic and Curio Display

Quite a lot of material has been contributed, but convenor Mr A.L. Walker would welcome more.  The latest item was a 20 pound piece of pure copper found at the old blacksmithâ€™s shop at the mine by Mr W. Voumard.  It is also hoped to have an Honour Roll in pictures, so relatives of service personnel are requested to hand in photographs of their sons, brothers, husbands, sisters or daughters who volunteered for the war just completed.
