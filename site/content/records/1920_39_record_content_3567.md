Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial.  A general meeting of the committee decided on a civic reception for the Governor immediately before the foundation stone was laid.  Lady Weigall had not been invited and this oversight had been remedied.  She had expressed a wish to visit the Reformatory.  She is to be presented with a piece of malachite mounted in gold.  It was decided to hold a public lunch for the Governor.

[Bur the Governor later advised he would prefer this not happen and the program was revised accordingly.]

Pictures were suggested for the evening entertainment and it was suggested that the Governor might agree to show some of his biograph views.  Application will be made for a half holiday for the school.  The Burra Brass Band will be asked to assist.  The stone at the foot of the pillar will be inscribed To Our Glorious Dead after much discussion.

Miss Trix Pearce was appointed to the Records Committee.

Professor G.S. Henderson of the University of Adelaide advised that the ‘To’ in the inscription is superfluous and brings the inscription a little nearer to the level of an after dinner toast.
