There was rain on the 26th and up to about 9 a.m. on the 27th, but by noon the weather was very good and the largest crowd for some years was seen at the park. Almost £80 was taken at the gate.  The secretary, Mr John McLaren, remains the main pillar of the society.  Agricultural entries were down, but the quality was up.  Dairy produce was a good display and poultry was one of the highlights.  Draught stock entries were larger.  Blood stock entries were few, but roadster stock was quite nicely represented.  Dogs were more numerous this year, but cattle and pigs were very scarce.  Sheep as usual were the main feature of the show and Thomas Sandland was the main prize-taker.  Over £20 was taken at the door of the evening concert.
