Cornish Migrants

We have seen a letter from William Allen, Emigration Agent for SA in Penzance.  He says many persons in that area are interested in migrating to SA and among them are many skilled miners.  In Cornwall business is dull, the potato crop has failed and distress was being felt and anticipated.  There are complaints about a lack of information from those who have migrated, but enough information has come back to stimulate great interest throughout Cornwall.  This is not surprising when it has become known that the average price of Kapunda ore per the Templar was over £20 per ton and that Burra Burra ore on the Malcolm brought £21-7-11¼ per ton.  The Cornishmen are capable of calculating the success of the venture and are also aware of successes on agriculture and horticulture.
