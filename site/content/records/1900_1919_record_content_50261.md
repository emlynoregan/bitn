Larrikinism is causing annoyance in Burra at present.  Mr F. Harrisâ€™s shutters were taken down Sunday night and spread around various doors, leaving the fruit in the window exposed to the sun.  Spitting on windows and other indecent acts are occurring as well as rude and boorish remarks they think of as wit.
