Nicholas Opie”

Between 10 and 11 was in the barn.  Heard Mrs Opie cry out that the stable was on fire.  Saw Paynter open the door and try to free the horses.  I began to tear down the stable to let the horses out.  Two broke their halters and fled through the door.  One was burnt to death.  Saw no one about and cannot account for the fire.  Was not smoking when I went out.  Have seen children about with squibs in the last week.

Mrs Opie:

Was in the kitchen about 10.30.  My little boy was going round to the front when he turned and called, ‘The stable is on fire.’  Called Mr Opie.  Saw Paynter open the door.  Did not go outside.  Did not see the boy about.

William Roberts:

The child left my house in Market Square at about 10.30 a.m.  My wife sent him to the opposite side of the creek to ask after his mother.

Elizabeth Ann Champion:

Saw the child W. Roberts on Sunday morning in Paxton Square.  Helped him cross the creek near to Mr Blackney’s.  The fire was burning at the time the bells were ringing for church.

The jury decided there was no evidence to show the origin of the fire.
