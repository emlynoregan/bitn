Local Board of Health

The Manager of the Bank of Australasia agreed it was not right that the residential bath water ran into the gutter in the street.  He suggested a drain across Commercial St to the creek.  Council agreed, but only at the Bank’s cost.

The Isolation Hospital costs were £156-12-6.  There were goods on hand that cost £69-19-2 and wages, rent provisions etc. cost £83-5-10.
