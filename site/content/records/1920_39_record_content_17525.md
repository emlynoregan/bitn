‘Back to Burra’.  An article by Dr Torr in The Australian Christian Commonwealth.

This was a generally interesting article, but not I think with any details that add much to what has already been noted.  There are two photographs from ‘Back to School’. 

There were also letters thanking organisers etc. from A.S. Rawlings & E. Bennett.
