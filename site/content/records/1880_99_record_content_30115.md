Ratepayers’ Meeting at Davieston, [i.e. Hanson] 17 October.

There was a large meeting of District of Hanson ratepayers complaining about the increasing of the rate to 1/- and of Council extravagance like tree planting at Davieston.  The explanation was that last year’s wet season had incurred great road costs and it was also the last year of a subsidy from the Government.  Works had to be done this year and there was a £100 overdraft.  The £20 spent on tree planting was on instructions from the previous Council.  Next year the hope was to have a rate of 9d again.

‘Mr Peter Smith thought it wrong that the Council Room should be used as a schoolroom and a chapel.  If he built a pig-stye, he did not use it as a stable or a barn.’

‘Mr J. Rogers said it was very narrow minded to introduce such a matter.’

Cr Worby thought the Wesleyans ought to pay for the accommodation seeing money was needed, but this did not get general support.

All in all it was quite a stormy meeting.
