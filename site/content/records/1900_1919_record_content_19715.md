Mt Bryan notes.  Some new farmers are moving in on the newly provided blocks, though there are grumblings that some went to those who ‘have got more land than they know what to do with already.’  The new township allotments don’t seem to have attracted buyers.  The stationmaster is E. Rumball.

[The new town allotments were in the new Government town surveyed adjacent to the original private town and confusingly officially designated Mt Bryan East.]
