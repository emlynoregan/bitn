Tennis.  Burra Association 5 February

‘A’ Grade	Willalo 9-99 defeated Hallett 9-84

Aberdeen 12-101 defeated Mt Bryan 6-65

Ironmine 11-82 defeated Hallett 7-82

[There would seem to be some error in having two results for Hallett.]

‘B’ Grade	Mt Bryan 11-81 defeated Willalo 7-76

Booborowie 11-91 defeated Aberdeen 7-67

Kooringa Lawn Tennis Club.  The match against Clare at Clare saw an easy win for the home side.

Brian Riggs of Prince Alfred College obtained six subjects at the recent Intermediate Examinations with three credits.  He also passed second year wool-classing at the School of Mines.

[Note that later in the same article it says he will go on to take Leaving Honours this year, which indicates the reference above should refer to the Leaving Examination; not the Intermediate.  This is confirmed in the paper of 1 March, page 2.]
