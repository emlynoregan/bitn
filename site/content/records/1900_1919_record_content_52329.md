Navy Day in Burra on 2 November was very successful.  The effort was in aid of the Navy and Port Adelaide Seamen’s Mission.  The street was decorated and the Rotunda decked in red, white and blue with placards around it calling on people to remember Jutland, Heligoland & the Cocos Islands.  The Naval Band from Adelaide under Lt Argent attended.  Mr J.N. Laurence represented the Seamen’s mission.  The band arrived by the midday train and marched to Best Place where they played several selections before marching to Kooringa for a welcome lunch at the Burra Hotel.  In the afternoon the various stalls in Market Square came to life selling souvenirs, buttons, cool drinks, flowers, lollies, luncheon and afternoon tea.
