Burra Post Office

Business has increased so much that facilities are cramped.  The switchboard at the exchange can handle 300 subscribers and that number has nearly been reached.  There is no room for expansion.  The Department surveyor has recently inspected the vacant block adjacent to the Billiard Saloon in Market Square and has recommended it and the Billiard Saloon be purchased, plus a Corporation owned lane at the rear.  Whether this advice will be followed has not yet been announced.  Even if it is done, shortages of building materials will delay any new post office for quite some time.  In the mean time it has been decided to try to relocate the postmasterâ€™s residence so that the residential area of the present building can be used to extend the telephone exchange and increase postal facilities.  It is intended that the Burra exchange will serve Gum Creek, Hanson and other small localities in the district.
