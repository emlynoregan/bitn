At Mr Anderson’s claim he complained of the impossibility of getting capital to develop his claim.

‘The Ibis’ claim of Fred Lewis, Roberts & L. Kellaway* showed much driving on a seam of low values.  There is a 112ft drive with some rich specimens along the way.  On stuff sent to Peterborough the yield just paid expenses.  They are on rations – 14lb of meat a month or ½lb a day.*

K. Kellaway on ‘The Burra Mongolata’ is on a narrow seam with a 110ft drive.*

At Pexton’s ‘Takati’ some large nuggets have been found.

Driving at Byles’ has extended 500ft one way and another and there is some sinking.  The family has been at work for 22 months.

Norman Gillett’s residence was very comfortable and with George Evans they have drive 150ft, have got some gold and still have hopes.  They are near Carpenter’s Café and call their show ‘The Rising Sun’ on a gully designated ‘The Old Kent Road’ and adjacent is ‘Rotten Row’ and ‘The Strand’ and a hut called ‘Willyama’.

Byles’ are sinking a shaft another 100ft.  Mr Hogan is manager and he said in all there was some 1,500ft of sinking and driving for some 1,000oz of gold with 100 tons of ore at grass.

At Rampton’s claim a lot of work has been done and so there has at Terry’s where some 50oz has been won.

Mr McDonald said he was collecting information to place some definite scheme before the Government which had spent a lot of money at Moonta for little result.

The miners discussed the need to have fracture, [explosive] which Mr Richardson when Minister of Mines said was impossible to supply.

The visitors had an excellent meal at Mr Carpenter’s Café.

[Note that statements marked * are clarified and/or corrected in the next report 54, 33, 18 Aug. 1933, page 3.]

T.H. Woollacott writes about the needs for unemployed men working at Mongolata.  There are miners employed for wages and small syndicates, but there are about 30 others who need to be supported to prove the field, but who need mining clothes for themselves and clothes for their families.  Since the field started about £12,000 worth of gold has been obtained - £4,000 of it since the battery started four months ago.  In reply to Mr A.D. McDonald MP the Premier recently said £25,000 had been spent at Moonta for a return of £10,000 worth of copper and £3,000 was spent at Mongolata for a battery and a water shed.  We should make a special practical effort on behalf of the town and Mongolata to stop the drift on unemployment locally and to keep those working who are doing so.  Thanks go to the ‘News’ Blanket Fund and Central Unemployment Relief Committee for blankets etc.
