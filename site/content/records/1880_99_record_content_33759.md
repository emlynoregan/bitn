The recent Fancy Fair had raised over £305 and expenses were less than £20.  W. Killicoat had donated £25 and W.P. Barker £50.  This sum will pay off the church debt and overdraft and general working debt and leave a credit balance.  £25 was voted to the incumbent whose salary had to be cut last Easter.
