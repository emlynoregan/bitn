Cr McBride moved that a footbridge be constructed at the Mine Bridge.  Cr McWaters 2nd.  Carried

The Pig and Whistle [footbridge] is to be repaired.

Some repairs will be made to the Rotunda roof.

Cr Radford moved that Bagot, Shakes and Lewis be approached to allow their yards to be used as a town pound yard.

The Mayor pointed out that such a move would involve appointing a pound-keeper and pound fees would not cover feed.  The motion lapsed.
