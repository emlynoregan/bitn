Football.  At Booborowie on Saturday: Booborowie 5.7 defeated Burra 4.9.

Hallett 3.6 defeated Terowie 3.3.

Leighton 7.4 defeated Spalding 3.12.

‘J.R.’ from Booborowie writes about the report last week of the Terowie-Booborowie football match.  While not wanting to praise the umpire, he felt some allowance had to be made for the near gale force wind and rain.
