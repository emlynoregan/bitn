Swimming 1994-95

Booborowie swimmers will only be able to use the pool when a supervisor is present.  Changes are in line with Education Department guidelines.

Hallett.  The pool will be cleaned and the surrounds tidied on 6 November for an opening ‘splash’ on 13 November.

Burra.  The Education Department and SACON have ordered an additional tank to correct the water balance problem and this should allow the plumbing to operate well.  Rob Kerin MP will officially open the pool on 2 December.
