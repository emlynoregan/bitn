Social to Recruits and £5,310 War Loan Appeal

On Monday 12 May a social was tendered ten more Burra Boys who have enlisted.  The crowd packed the hall, the gallery, the vestibule and spilled out onto the steps.  All the boys were Burra born and enlisted from Burra: AB Seaman Jack Parker RAN; Cpl Reg. Davey, Ptes Charlie Herbert, Rex Opperman, Dave Wooton, Reg. Schwier, Laurie Ward; Transport Drivers Len and Charlie Jesser and Tom Allen.

The meeting began with the singing of the National Anthem and the Song of Australia.  This was followed by community singing of popular patriotic songs from typed sheets.  The Mayor, T.H. Woollacott introduced Mr G.S. Hawker.  After his speech Miss Mavis Fairchild sang a song and then sang There’ll Always be an England as an encore.  Mr H. Jennison’s speech was followed by a song by Mr G.H. Dolman, and then Envoy Winfield of the Salvation Army spoke.  Mr G. Ganley then favoured with a song, before Mrs Frank Sara gave each of the guests a parcel from the FFCF, after which the Mayor places a wrist watch on the arm of each of the guests.

The Mayor then launched the appeal for people to lend money to the War Loan.  Dr D.M. Steele spoke in support of the War Loan and was supported by the Mayor.

Each of the guests then responded, For they are jolly god fellows was sung, votes of thanks were moved and seconded by H.E. Fuss and Walter Lee and the social closed with Auld Lang Syne.

£5,310 was pledged to the War Loan.
