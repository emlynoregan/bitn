‘I have only to add that I believe gold to exist in Victoria in vast abundance, yet that hundreds are there who curse the day that they left South Australia and that there is more morality observable at the diggings than in Melbourne.’  I shall probably go again to the diggings when the rains set in, but I would not take my family to reside in Melbourne.

W.H. writes from Forest Creek, 25 January 1852.

[He reports having been there for 10 days without any success yet.  The party had sunk five holes varying from 8 to 20 ft deep, but found nothing.  It was very hard work.  He says of those around that some have made fortunes, but the majority have barely made decent wages.  The area is honeycombed with holes, making walking at night very dangerous.  Scores of men, he says, are leaving in disgust at the way they have to live.  The costs are excessive.  He does not advise coming at present with water so scarce.]
