Editorial on The Burra Mine and the Burra Burra Copper Co.

We now know that restarting the mine is as far off as ever.  After 3 years 4 months of waiting for news the directors have not enough capital for the erection of the machinery to pump out the mine or to treat the ore.  The money already spent will thus be lost.  ‘Burra is rapidly going down.’

‘There is, we believe, more copper in the Burra Mine than has ever been taken out of it.’

Only capital is required.

Other towns have been assisted financially while Burra has never had a subsidy from the Government for mining purposes.  All we want now is to borrow machinery lying idle – costs to be repaid, as they certainly could be – when the ore bodies below water level are struck.  The townspeople showed at the meeting that they are unanimous in the view that Government should render some assistance at this critical time.  The directors would carry on with a concentrating plant if the mine were dewatered.
