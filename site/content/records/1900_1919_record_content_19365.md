Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co.  Tributers are turning over some stuff, but it is hard work to get it up the incline to the old floors.  The water has risen to its usual height and the pumping plant has been cleared away.  The directors do not favour doing anything during the period of Mr Horn’s option, so it has been decided to treat the stuff in the Burra Creek near W. Finch’s.  It is thought the directors will be out of pocket if they have to pay wages here.  In some parts of the creek tributers have made fairly good wages, only not so far down.
