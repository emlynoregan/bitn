Mr Lawn said some single men support families.

Since the meeting work has been found but the report is not very clear about how many and with whom.

[It seems to say 10 married men offered jobs relaying the railway line and 30 men, including single men with dependants could be put on. (Apparently at the same job.)

In the next paper the Mayorâ€™s report makes it clear that it meant that 30 men, married and single, were taken on the railway relay gang.]
