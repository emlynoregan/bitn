Obituary.  Pearl Halls, wife of Thomas F. Halls, died on 7 February at Semaphore aged 33.  Late of Burra.  (Page 3 adds she was the daughter-in-law of T.P. Halls of Kooringa and is survived by a husband and three small children.)  [Born Pearl Ella Norma Barnett, but her birth is unclear.  Age at marriage suggests a birth in 1908.  The above suggests probably 1904 and the registration of Deaths CD seems to be clearly wrong in saying she was 57!  And gives place of death as Queenstown.]
