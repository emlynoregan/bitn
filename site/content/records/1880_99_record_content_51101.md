From the door the editor heard Cr Linkson try again to have his objection recorded.

The Mayor then saw the editor and others by the door taking notes and ordered the Inspector to close it which was done with some difficulty.

By this time ratepayers and non-ratepayers had taken up positions on forms and boxes to get a glimpse inside the Chamber.  After a few minutes Crs Walsh, West and Linkson came out, having refused to sit in a closed Council.

The ratepayers decided to call a ratepayers’ meeting and subsequently a large deputation led by Mr J. Sampson called upon the Mayor to call such a meeting and the Mayor said he would attend to the matter.

The mayor and three Councillors then transacted some business as a growing crowd gathered outside.

Legal proceedings are to be instituted against one or two for the illegal ejection of ratepayers and in respect to the letter sent to the police – it being noted that the pre-prepared letter giving the reason for calling the police stated that Mr W.J. Davey was the obstructing person when in fact it was Mr Sampson who had been specifically asked to move.
