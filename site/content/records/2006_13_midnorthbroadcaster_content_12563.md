Darrol Pollard will close his antique business in Commercial Street when he retires this month after almost 40 years in business.  He began trading in the early 1970s on the corner of Commercial and Queen Streets and moved across the street ten years later for 30 years of successful trading in old wares and antiques.  In his time in business he hired props to the films Breaker Morant and Fair Game.  Darrol says the interest in antiques has changed and more recently the younger buyers are looking for techno savvy products and modern appliances.  After 30 years without a holiday he is looking forward to travelling and catching up with relatives.  [Photo]
