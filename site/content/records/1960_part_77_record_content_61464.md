The New Elders-GM Stockyards were opened on Tuesday by Chairman of the Burra Burra DC Mr Roy Jeffery.  Until 1967 Mr Jeffery had been manager of Southern Farmers at Burra for many years.  He said from 1887 for many years the prices of Burra Livestock Markets ruled SA.  The Bon Accord yards at Burra North were the scene of Elders first country market.  He traced the story of sales by Elders at Kooringa and by Shakes & Lewis; Morris; Morris, Sandland & Barritt; and Goodchild, Duff & Co. in yards at the Burra Hotel and behind Paxton Square.  Agents had sold 40,000 sheep a month or 200,000 a year.  In 1888 there was a yarding of 39,060 sheep on the site of the present yards.  The record yarding was for 44,000 sheep and 750 cattle in 1895.  For the new yards Southern Farmers had combined with Elders with an offering of 2,000 sheep and 200 cattle.  Elders-GM offered 5,140 sheep and sold 4,810.
