Housing Trust.  The Town Council has offered the remainder of the triangular portion of land alongside the PMG line shop to the SA Housing Trust for the purpose of erection of 4 or 5 rental homes.  This portion of land is about 1 acre immediately behind the new Electricity Trust’s £17,000 Office and Depot.  It is understood a start will be made on the new depot early in 1965.  A new Electricity Trust home is to be built on the east side of the block previously owned by the late Mr Luke Day.  [Luke Day died 30 August 1962 and this seems to be the first reference to his death.  CHECK THIS.]
