Election Meeting.  On Friday the Institute was well filled to hear speeches by Hon. J. Jelley and Hon. T. Butterfield & Mr S. McHugh.

Hon. J. Jelley said Mr Butler painted a very grim view of SA, but there were ample assets to cover the admittedly substantial debts.  The Liberal & Country Party had promised more employment, bigger wages, less taxation, more educational facilities etc., but in fact many charges had risen.  He denounced the Railways Rehabilitation Scheme which had thrown 8,000 men out of work.  Unemployment was the most serious problem they had ever faced.  As for unions making it worse, he referred to a number of factories etc. where men had come forward and asked to be put on shorter hours and had taken unpaid holidays to maintain men in work – when the Government was asked to do this at Islington Railway Workshops they had refused.  He would get rid of the Legislative Council, open up more land, especially in the South East that was now in sheep walks.  He attacked the Government on a number of fronts including interference in the Police Department.

Hon. T. Butterfield also condemned the pessimism of Butler in talking down the state.  SA is far from bankrupt.  Attempts to close the hotels at 1 p.m. on Saturday were a diversion – ‘a tin pot affair’ – anyway too many in the Upper House own breweries for it to get through.  The West Coast had been shamefully treated.  Men were still waiting for the Tod River Scheme after 35 years.  The Government’s settlement policy is a shambles.  He attacked Hon. Jenkins for allowing dagoes to be employed in the sandalwood industry.

There were repeated interruptions throughout his speech.

Mr McHugh spoke also on hotel closing and rural policy, but as he speaks again on 31 March his views will then be published.
