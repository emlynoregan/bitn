Obituary.  Mr William D. Roach died at Terowie recently.  He was an early settler and prominent figure in the northern farming and pastoral world.  ‘Roachdale’ sheep have always been prominent in the Peterborough and other northern shows, winning many championships.  Mr Roach was the son of the late James Roach, who came to Australia from Cornwall in 1848 and was born in Ballarat in 1857, coming to SA as a lad.  After spending some time in Burra, he went to White Hut and Clare.  At 17 he took up land at Terowie, being one of the original settlers on the eastern side.  He concentrated on farming till 1901, after which he turned entirely to sheep.  He was a member of the original Terowie DC formed in 1888 and was Chairman for 27 years.  He was an original trustee of the Terowie Institute, of which he was a member for 56 years.  He was also one of the original trustees of the Terowie Methodist Church and a member of the Board of Management of the Peterborough Soldiers’ Memorial Hospital.  He managed the Petherton Estate for several years after the death of Mr George Hiles and went to ‘Roachdale’ Terowie in 1903, living there until his death.  He took an interest in sport and in his younger days was a good cricketer.  He was educated at Burra under Dr J.R. Stephens and at White Hut.  For a considerable time he was Chairman of the Terowie School Board of Advice and took a keen interest in school and town matters generally.  He married Emma Hiles, daughter of the late Mr George Hiles of Petherton Estate, Hallett.  She predeceased him, but three children survive: Mrs A.H. Smith of Huddlestone, Gilbert Roach of Terowie and Mrs D.L. van Senden of Naracoorte.  He remarried in 1902 Ada Hiles, widow of the late George Hiles Jnr, who survives him.  He is also survived by his brother and sisters: Henry Roach of Terowie, Mrs A.R. Tuck of Terowie and Mrs G.H. Teague of NZ.  There are 12 grandchildren.  [William Dunstan Roach died 23 December 1935 Terowie aged 79.]
