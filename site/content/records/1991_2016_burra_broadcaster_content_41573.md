Len Bence recently made a long-awaited visit to the Australian War Memorial, where he saw ‘G for George’ – the same model Lancaster Bomber that he flew on thirty missions in WWII.  Len travelled to Canberra with Roger Boehm.  When they got there they were met by Dr Brendan Nelson, Director of the Australian War Memorial, who pushed Len around the old Lancaster in a wheelchair.  It was a very emotional reunion for Len.  [2 photos.]
