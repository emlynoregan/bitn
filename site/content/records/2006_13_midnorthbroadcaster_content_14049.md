Friends of Burra Parks held its AGM over a meal of pizzas and pasta at La Pecora Nera in Burra last Tuesday.  16 people attended.  The office bearers were all returned for another year: President, Bob Lamb; Senior Ranger, Wendy Cliff and Treasurer, Arthur Simpson.  In spite of adverse weather conditions during the year the group gave 260 hours of volunteer work on fencing, weeding and helping with flora and fauna surveys.
