Mr Melrose and the Chairman then had an altercation over the question being brought up in Council.  Melrose accused the Chairman of being a turn-coat, which the Chairman vehemently denied.  He said they had thought Mr Hawkes was in favour of the move.  The District Council had asked Mr Warnes to go and see the Apoinga Councillors and ask for their support – such was Mr Warnes authority for going.  He also disputed the concept of disenfranchisement of ratepayers.

Mr Collins supported the Chairman on the disenfranchisement question.

Mr Warnes said, as to the Chairman’s statements: ‘that gentleman had never liked him in his life’.

The Chairman demanded he withdraw that statement: ‘though I do despise your methods in this instance’.

Warnes said he could get his Council’s endorsement of his position at any time.  He then rehearsed the history of the motion:

It was brought in and carried by a simple majority.

Declared then not to be carried because the Chairman reversed his decision.

The Board then said there would be no problem if it were raised again.

The Chairman then upheld a technical objection which ruled Mr Warnes out of order.

This, he said, did not give one much confidence in his fellow man, when promises had been made.
