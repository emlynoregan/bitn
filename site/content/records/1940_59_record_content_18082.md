Obituary.  Mr J.H. Young died in Melbourne on 30 June aged 85.  He was well known in Burra in the 1870s.  He was particularly well known in pharmaceutical circles and was the founder of the Pharmacy Society and its first registrar in SA.  He served his apprenticeship with Messrs Dyers in Burra and served here for quite a number of years before leaving about 1879 to conduct a dispensary in Hutt St Adelaide.  In 1896 he left there to edit the trade newspaper The Chemist & Druggist of Australia which later became the Journal of Pharmacy.

[James John Henry Young born 23 July 1859 Ashmore (Burra).]
