Notice.  To the Hanson tinkettlers.

Mrs Dixon is not aware she stated that she was a private property owner.  As you say you are ladies and gents, I wonder you did not act as such when you came to visit Mr Carpenter’s house.  Surely a person can come and live in your ‘city’ without receiving such a disgraceful welcome from a few country folks.  I never knew gentlemen used such language as I heard used here.  Mrs J.A. Dixon.
