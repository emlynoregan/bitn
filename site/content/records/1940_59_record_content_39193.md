Letter.  Noel Tiver writes in reference to the comments about the Light Horse Troop in Burra before WWII as mentioned by the Mayor when speaking at the formation of a Platoon of the 27th Battalion.  He thinks he should also have mentioned the magnificent Light Horse Troop that was in the town before WWI.  These men enlisted in a body in August 1914, with their leader the late Major Lance Lewis.  They formed part of the original 3rd Light Horse Regiment and fought with distinction at Gallipoli and in Palestine.
