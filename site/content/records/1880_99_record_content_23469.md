‘A Lady’ writes in to say that the Penny Reading have turned out a much greater success than ever thought of and many have seen full houses.  All praises to Messrs Roach and Wittber.  They are due to end after 12, so there are two to go.  Many will regret it.  She hopes that the final fling might be a composite of the best acts from the previous 11 weeks, rather than pay for Adelaide talent to visit.
