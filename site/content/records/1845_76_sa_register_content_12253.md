Kooringa News, 30 March

Since Signor Cutolo’s departure we have had Mr Creswick & Co., who played for several nights to thin houses.  Mr Gome delivered three lectures, and exhibited magic lantern views, including dissolving views, chromotropes etc.

The first lecture was in the Institute, the next at Mr Lamb’s [Aberdeen Hotel] and the third at the [Burra] Hotel.  They were very fairly attended.

On Friday Mr Burton & his Equestrian Troupe entered the township from Clare, and though it was 6 p.m. when the drays arrived with the tent, all was ready for a show at 8 p.m. before a crowded audience.  A repetition on Saturday took place before the largest audience seen in Burra and was highly applauded.

The North Burra Mine is to be worked initially by a party of four.  A rough sample assayed at 20% copper and a washed sample gave 45%.

The River Broughton Company has engaged four more miners making eight now at work and Mr John Snell has been appointed Captain.

A meeting of Wheal Sarah shareholders saw a further call made and the mine is being worked with vigour.  The first pile of ore has been crushed and sampled and will likely be sold in a few days.  A number of drays are on the road with ore from this mine.
