Burra Town Council

One person in particular is letting his cows out to graze at night and they enter peopleâ€™s gardens and do other damage to fences and gates etc.  Cr Jennison has made a number of complaints and the Mayor has also had problems and sought legal advice after capturing the animals.  The owner was prepared to settle, but that did not restore his garden.  It was resolved that the ranger enforce the law.
