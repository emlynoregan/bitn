1920.  The population of Burra was 1751 â€“ 832 males and 919 females.

1920.  47% of deaths were males and 52% females, but 60% of males had obituaries in the Burra Record, while only 40% of women did.

By 1920 almost 50% of males and females who died had more than one obituary.  [How does this fit with point 3?]

Obituaries for men tended to be significantly longer than for men throughout the period.

On headstones in Burra Cemetery 1880-1940 more information is recorded for men irrespective of marital status.

Changes in Burra from 1860s to 1890s.  Research by Brenton Stocker, BCS Year 12 History.

During the 1860s there was a measles outbreak that was responsible for the death of an average five children per day.  [This is an extraordinary claim if it is for Burra and would need a date range to be possible.  In August 1862 twenty-five children died at the peak of a measles outbreak.]

In 1860 potatoes were about 6/10 per 5 pound bag, bread 6 pence a loaf and mutton 1/2 per pound.

Thomas Phillips, appointed head blacksmith at the Burra Burra Mine died in May 1868.  While working at the anvil he struck himself in the abdomen with a hammer.  Two days later he was dead.

1890.  Potatoes cost c. 9 shillings per 5 pound bag, bread was 17 pence per loaf and eggs about one shilling a dozen.
