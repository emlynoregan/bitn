Graham & Raelene Waters have retired from Waters Burra Bakery after more than 50 years.  Graham has spent 40 years working at night in the bakehouse and is enjoying the break from the work as he nears his 70th birthday.  Ian and Sharon Parkinson of Burra have taken a four-year lease and are managing the business.  Graham and Raelene’s sons Scott and Chris are still taking care of the customers’ demands, but are not ready at this time to take on the management of the business, though it is probable they will do so in the future.
