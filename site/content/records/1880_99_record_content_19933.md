Burra Town Council, 16 November.

Messrs Wells, Pinch, Linkson & Bentley presented a memorial asking the Council not to proceed with the ford over the creek and saying the dayman should be removed from near Mr Ridgway’s to Redruth Hill where Mr Wells said it was dangerous to move about at night.

Cr Ridgway said that Mr Wells had been very rude to him that morning and he thought it hard to be insulted when he laboured for the good of the town.  The works around his premises had cost very little.

Grants-in-Aid will be paid next week.

The closure of Short St order has been duly completed and returned to Council.

The Mayor read his report, which we publish, next issue.

Cr West moved its adoption and said that despite some warm debates on occasion much positive work had been achieved.  Cr Ridgway 2nd the motion.

Cr Tiver supported it and so did Cr Coglin.

Cr Sampson also did, though there were parts of the report he could not fully accept.

Cr Symons also endorsed it.

Cr West then read an address to the Mayor thanking him for his year’s work.

Cr Sampson reverted to the North Ward Memorial.  At the last meeting the Mayor had told him the work had been ordered, but it did not appear in the minutes.  He questioned the right of the Council to do any work in the bed of the creek and certainly those who questioned the work had a right to do so, for in the event of a flood they would suffer.  Several jobs done in Aberdeen were not ordered by Council.  He did not think any Councillor should order such work and it should be discontinued.

Cr Tiver said Cr Sampson reminded him of a storm in a teacup, and a dog in a manger.  He thought the work had been properly ordered.  The work in question* should be done.

[* The minute authorising the work was belatedly found.  See VII, 495, 24 Nov. 1885, page 2, where it says the work was on the ford to the south ‘end of the new plantation’, which would indicate the ford in St Just St.]

Cr Ridgway said he might have committed an error, but he thought the work was authorised.  The improvement in Ellen Tce [sic] [Should be Helen] had been done at the instigation of the Road Board stationman.  The work done in the creek bed did not stop the waterway, but gave an enlarged waterway and cost nearly nothing as it came from a cutting opposite.  He did not care about the ratepayers’ remarks, but did expect support from Council.

Cr Sampson moved the ford be no further made.  Cr Symons 2nd.

Cr West moved the matter should stand over till the new Council was elected.

Cr Coglin 2nd and Cr Sampson withdrew his motion. Cr West’s motion was then carried.

Cr Ridgway said the total cost was £5 or £2-10-0 more.

[*The work is not clearly identified, but given Cr Ridgway’s involvement and his comment that: ‘The works around his premises had cost very little.’  It seems likely that the ford in dispute was the one across the Burra Creek in St Just Street. This was confirmed when the missing minute was eventually found see: VII, 495, 24 Nov. 1885, page 3 & VII, 496, 27 Nov. 1885 page2.]
