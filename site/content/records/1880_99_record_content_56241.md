Burra Town Council

The Treasurer has declined to make a special grant of Â£30.

C. Grow applied to be paid for 2 hours of cab hire.

Cr Parks said it was 1 not 2 hours.

Cr Harris said they had departed after 3 p.m. and were back by 3.40 p.m.

The Mayor said that if the cab was booked for a certain time and not used it should still be paid for.

Cr Harris denied it had been so ordered.

The account was paid.

Cr Hardy said he was in possession of information that would put them on the right track for a new by-law concerning hawkers.

A deputation waited on Council seeking their aid in sending children to the Adelaide Exhibition.

Council will co-operate with the Burra School Board of Advice in this matter.

Various tenders for road works accepted.

Waterworks.

They are running well at present.

Cr Hardy asked if any payments had been received for water taken from the standpipes in Aberdeen or Kooringa.

The Town Clerk said no.

It was resolved to lock the standpipes, as water had (at least) been used in conjunction with the building of a house near the station.

J. Wilks granted a slaughtering licence.
