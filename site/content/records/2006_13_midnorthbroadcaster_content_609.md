Burra Residents at a Public Meeting last Wednesday night gave the Goyder Council a clear message that it was unacceptable to proceed with plans to redevelop Market Square and Best Place.  The Council called the meeting to gauge opinion before the final decision to continue or abandon the project was made at the Council meeting on 16 May.  The plans involved major changes in Market Square, including the establishment of a major car parking area in the Town’s main street, a more direct traffic route and a slight repositioning of the rotunda to allow widening of the main road.  Planning Officer John Brak explained that the plans had been made possible by a grant of monies from Planning SA and the monies were specifically for projects that rejuvenated regional centres, increased local income from tourism and reclaimed space from traffic, roads and car parks.

After public consultation in September 2004 Council had consultants Hames Sharley outline master plans and by July last year final engineering plans were completed by K.B.R. Consulting.

An estimated 170 people attended and many spoke against the plans after being told the finer details, particularly concerning costs.  So far about $90,000 had been spent.  CEO Steve Kerrigan said the predicted cost was $1,330,000 with 50% met by a Planning SA Grant, 50% from the Council and township – 25% by town ratepayers and 25% by the rest of the Goyder area.  This would mean a projected rate rise of $43.50 a year over the next 20 years.  Considerations raised included:

Cost.

Changes to parking with seven car parking spaces lost between Commercial Street Corner and Gaslight [Mt Pleasant Rd.] and a total loss of 13 spaces.

Paul Wilson said there was more to Burra’s retail area than Market Square – why wasn’t the whole area involved?

Others looked to the state of footpaths and gutters in dangerous disrepair and questioned the Council’s priorities.

How would Landmark be able to unload stock with the removal of the parking space currently used, to allow for a wider two-way road?  A Council spokesperson said there would be room (with trucks backing in from Thames St) and that the changes had been engineered for traffic safety.  The movement of the rotunda would make the room needed.

Brian Christie asked whether B-double trucks could make the turn into Market Street from Commercial Street in the event of the bypass being blocked.

Maureen Wright questioned the whole consultation process – fine tuning details now being discussed should have been sorted out long ago.

The Council Chairman said that it was not often that they got the chance for a 50-50 subsidy.

Thym Bitter and Geraldine Smedley moved that the project be discontinued and after much discussion the motion was carried with a huge majority.

Most Burra Ward Councillors indicated that although this decision was not binding on them, they would vote with the feelings of the community.

At the Council meeting on Tuesday a motion was carried against the plan to redevelop Market Square and Best Place.
