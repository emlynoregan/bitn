Burra Golf Associates.  President Lynette Mosey reports on 1985.

[Among the usual summary of events there are some noteworthy points:

Pat Field prepared a brief history of the club for the golf book to be published by SALGU next year.

30 new chairs were purchased for the clubhouse.

The scrapes were improved and made smaller.

It was disappointing to have to cancel Guest Day due to lack of entries.]
