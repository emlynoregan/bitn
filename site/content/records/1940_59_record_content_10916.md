Burra Town Council, 20 July

The Institute Committee advised it approved the Council discussing the matter of the purchase of the Institute with the District Council.  The assessment for 1941-42 was adopted for 1942-43 with the necessary additions and alterations.

The Bon Accord Bridge was now limited to 5 ton loads or a lorry load of about 30 bags of wheat, but military trucks up to 13 tons could still cross.  The authorities will be asked to reconsider the matter.

Burra Red Cross Executive Committee held its first AGM.  In the year there had been a Baby Competition, a Children’s Frolic and Dance and a visit from the Governor and Lady Barclay-Harvey.  Their quota of fund raising had been £350 and the three Burra units had raised £589-0-9.  The RSL Wives Group had been registered in January.  A request to secure a store for Red Cross goods resulted in Miss Scovell offering the use of a suitable building.  Officers elected: Chair, Mrs T.E. Ashton, Vice-Presidents, Mesdames Steele, Hawker and F. Sara; Treasurer, Mr S.C. Genders and Assistant Treasurer, Mrs S.C. Genders.
