Burra Mine.

An attempt is being made to reopen the Burra Mine.  We understand an endeavour to float a company with a capital of £175,000 is involved.  The original venture in 1845 had a capital of £12,320 and in 30 years produced 234,648 tons of ore yielding 51,622 tons of copper, valued at £4,749,224.  It [at one stage] employed 1,000 men and paid £826,585 in dividends.  Work ceased due to declining copper prices and the signs of exhaustion of certain rich ore lodes, but it closed before the 300’ level had been reached and its sulphides exploited.  There are many stories of riches remaining in the mine.  A modern company seems to have the prospects of paying a dividend.  The dumps on recent assay show 4% copper ore, which would yield 1% pure copper.  The dump alone should pay for the machinery for the whole mine.  Modern pumps and mining methods should make it pay.  Dredging should work well in Burra.

W.C.L. West writes from Glenelg outlining some of the history of the mine and listing its shafts.

Burra Rifle Club.  On 16 March the 16th stage of the Burra Record trophy was fired.  The best four results were: D. Field, A.C. Aughey, J.E. Harris & R.G. Bernhardt.

Mongolata Gold Field.

Curlew Mine – a useful ‘button’ from a crushing weighed 5 oz 18 dwt 21 gr.  The claim has good prospects.

Baldina Mongolata GM Syndicate for fortnight to 9 March.

Farnden’s Hill.  Crosscutting west of Hogan’s Shaft to 15’, but now stopped: no values.

Crosscutting east to 25’. 

Crosscutting west of Riggs Open Cut to 25’: no leader.
