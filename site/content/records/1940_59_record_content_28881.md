Civic Farewell to Dr & Mrs Steele

The number attending caused the gathering to be moved from the Council Chamber to the main hall.  Mayor Jennison presided.  At the start Josie Jennison presented Mrs Steele with a beautiful sheaf of flowers.  The Mayor regretted that they had gathered to say farewell to a pair of such fine citizens.  Dr Steele had been an ideal family doctor who had an uncanny way of gaining the confidence of all the family.  They all knew the great part Dr Steele had played in WWI, where he earned an MC on the field of battle.  He had met Dr Steele once in France at the time of a big battle, when hundreds of cases had been brought in and he had seen him in action.  He also recalled Dr Steele’s role in WWII, where he had been a brilliant speaker from the public platform and always managed to say the right thing at the right time.  He also recalled all the speeches Dr Steele had made to the High School children as President of the High School Council – always giving them something solid to think about.

Cr Carpenter spoke in support and was glad Dr Steele’s continuing interest in Koo-owie Station would maintain a link with Burra.

Crs Lee & Woollacott also spoke for the Council.

Mr J.G. Sara spoke for the High School Council.

Mary Pearce and Harold Steele spoke for the students.

T.H. Woollacott spoke for the residents of Burra.  He also spoke of Mrs Steele’s work as President of Burra Red Cross during the recent war and also of Margaret Steele as a worker for the cause.

Mr Ed Finch gave support as chairman of the Burra Burra Hospital Board and for the Burra Burra DC.

Mrs R.J. Jeffery spoke on behalf of Red Cross members in appreciation of the work of Mrs Steele over 20 years of service.

Mr M.T. Fuller for the RSL acknowledged Dr Steele’s work in the past as President of that body and as Co-ordinator for the Burra & District for the Civil Defence in WWII.

Miss M. Rogers as President of the CWA said Mrs Steele had given valuable service for 12 years membership of that body.

Mr L.H. Thomas spoke of Dr Steele’s membership of the Bowling Club and the frequent appearance of his name on the Honour Board there.

Other speakers were:

Rev. A.S. Barrett for the Churches of Burra

Mr M.G. Dobson re the Tennis and Golf Clubs

Miss Marg. Davies re Mrs Steele’s Golf Club membership

And Messrs R.J. Jeffery, J. McGrath, M. Hegarty & F.T. Sara.

The Mayor presented a handsome lampshade and a cheque to buy an easy chair.  Dr Steele made a response thanking all for their kindness and Mrs Steele also thanked all well-wishers.
