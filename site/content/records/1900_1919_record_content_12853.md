Mr James Bennetts celebrated 50 years as a local preacher at Broken Hill recently.  He came to Adelaide in 1854 and rode a bullock dray to Burra where he was associated with Dr W.G. Torr in the Sunday school.  He then went to Moonta Mines and 17 years ago to Broken Hill.  He first preached in Burra.
