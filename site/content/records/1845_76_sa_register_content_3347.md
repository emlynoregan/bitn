Arrival of Migrants  [Editorial]

On 5 December four ships arrived carrying free immigrants and other passengers:

The Hooghly departed Plymouth on 14 August (99 days from the Lizard.)

The Baboo left Plymouth on 24 August, the Duke of Bedford on 20th and the Thomas Lowry on 31st.

[The rest of the editorial conveys news from England that arrived with these vessels.  It includes news of the Chartist uprising and arrests in Manchester.]
