The Help and Nurture Developing Societies Cycling Club (HANDS) held a cycling fundraiser called ‘Care to Ride’ last month, featuring a stopover in Burra.  The event raises money for health and education projects in East Timor comprised 12 cyclists participating in a nine-leg journey totalling more than 9,000 km.  The Lutheran Ladies provided a hot meal when they arrived at the Burra show Hall.  This was followed by a slide show of the work being done by HANDS.  At this stage the event had raised about $20,000.  The group plans to return to Burra for next year’s fundraising event.
