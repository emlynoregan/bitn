Pages 4-8

Dominated by advertisements of considerable size.  Most are two columns wide by 3 inches (7.5 cm) in depth or larger.  News here is dominated by sports results.  District Councils are also reported at length here.  CWA news is significant and the activities of the schools get good coverage.  News of any sort rarely exceeds 1½ of the 6 columns.  One page usually carried a ‘Cash Column’.  This was essentially very brief advertisements of items for sale.
