Mr Ralph Oakley of Mt Bryan has an injury to his lower back after being struck by the wheel of an aircraft that was carrying out aerial spraying.  He and two others were ‘flag-marking’ when the accident occurred.  He was grazed by the wheel as he flung himself to the ground.  His condition is painful, but satisfactory.
