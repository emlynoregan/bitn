Editorial. The Midland Road Board some time ago agreed to pay half the cost of making the approaches from side streets to the main roads in the town. The Corporation then went ahead on this undertaking and spent c. £100 and sent in an account for half the cost, or almost £50. The Board baulked at this total and seems to have cast about for an excuse not to pay. It referred the matter to its surveyor who has presented a most remarkable report to justify the Board's not paying. If there is any fault it lay in the Board's unconditional agreement to fund half the cost. The report accepts that four approaches are fair and will be paid for. It also says `the whole of the works have been well done'. It then remarkably says that the road connecting two approaches between Broad's Hotel and the new Redruth Bridge is not finished or fit for traffic. It is fit for traffic, though no top metal has yet been spread, but that can be done anytime, now that the bog that existed there in winter has been removed. In any case it is their job to pay for the approaches and not the road. All the rest are dismissed as private approaches. This is nonsense and all but one lead directly to more than one house and in any event it is common for approaches to be made where no home is in sight. The question for the necessity of the streets lies with the Corporation. The surveyor has exceeded his duty by every word written. The Corporation will not do its duty unless it insists on the Board keeping its promise.
