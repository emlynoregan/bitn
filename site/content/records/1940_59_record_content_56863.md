Mt Bryan Volunteers met on 19 November to prepare rosters and work parties to counter the bushfire menace.  The meeting protested against the planting of trees along main roads adjacent to railway lines (as had been done by the CWA) because grass under the trees was liable to catch fire from passing trains.  [The names of those involved are printed.]
