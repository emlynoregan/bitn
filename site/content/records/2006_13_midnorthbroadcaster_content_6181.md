The Ratepayers’ Action Group has expressed concern over the proposed $8 million plan.  Spokesperson Helen Szuty says no public consultation has occurred with the communities at Burra, Farrell Flat, Booborowie, Hallett, Whyte Yarcowie and Terowie – more than 50% of both the area and population of the Regional Council.  Mayor Mattey said the Council had neither discussed nor committed loan funds and a decision to support the concept did not imply that the Council would fund the concept in any form.  Detailed economic research would be needed to be submitted to the community for consideration.
