Percy W. Dyer writes:

On Saturday 8 June Messrs Bright and Everard visited the place to acquaint themselves with the needs of the district.  A deputation waited on them, stressing the need for employment and they said they had just driven through the town to Redruth and had given instructions for a bridge to be built near the Mine Store.  [The Mine Bridge.]  And for a channel to be cut on the side of Commercial Street.  On the following morning four or five men were seen preparing the channel, ready for paving.  Several loads of stone were thrown down along the road.  In a few days all action stopped and nothing more has been done, except to increase the heap of stone along the road.  This is a scandalous way to treat starving men as well as an inconvenience to the tradesmen of the town.  I do not know if the fault lies with the Board or with Surveyor Macaulay, but something is radically wrong for men to be waiting five weeks for something to be done.
