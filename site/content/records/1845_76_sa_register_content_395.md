A considerable supply of doors and window frames and building materials has been seen heading to the Burra Burra Mines.

A man recently there reports a single explosion that released 30 tons of ore valued at £600.  Some experienced tributers are said to be earning over £7 a week and one confident report goes so far as to make one class of earnings equal to £50 per month per man.
