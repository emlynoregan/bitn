After six years a new assessment was made in which property values in the town fell.  Mr Bartholomæus was appointed and his assessment was 16% lower than the previous one.  There was only one appeal and that assessment was upheld.

Ward expenditure was:

North Ward	£80-14-4

East Ward	£89-14-8

West Ward	£96-7-6
