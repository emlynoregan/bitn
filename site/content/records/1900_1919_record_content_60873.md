Burra Hospital Board.

New appointees to the Board: Messrs Wheare, Chambers, Martin, Humphrys & Sampson.

Dr Steele applied for an increase of salary from £75 to £120, as he was now the only medical officer now at the hospital, though he would always welcome sharing duties.  Proposed and carried.

There were presently over 20 patients in the hospital.
