Crs Sampson and Parks were justified in proceeding with the work: it was unlike work done recently in North Ward without the sanction of Council, yet there was nothing said about that, simply because Cr Hardy was implicated.  Cr Hardy had no more authority than anyone else to interfere and had the labourers knocked off a serious accident would have resulted, as on the road were placed loads of metal making it impassable.  Cr Hardy’s excuse at a Public Works Committee meeting on Friday night was to the effect that he had not been consulted.
