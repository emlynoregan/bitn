Obituary.  Mrs G.H. [Gustav Hermann] Schoenberg of Mt Bryan died at Burra hospital on 24 December 1936.  She was born at Greenock SA 28 September 1868, a daughter of the late Mr & Mrs Zanker.  Her parents soon moved to Walloway and then to Wonna where in 1891 she married Gustav H. Schoenberg and lived there for 17 years despite drought and other setbacks.  For nine years they did not even get back seed wheat.  In 1907 they moved to a property near Mt Bryan where they farmed successfully.  Mr Schoenberg died in 1922, but his widow held the property till 1936 when failing health forced her to sell and reside with her daughters in turn.  Six children survive: Messrs C.A. Schoenberg (Coolgardie WA), A.B. Schoenberg (Aberdeen), G. Herman Schoenberg (Waterloo), Mrs B.H. Kleinig (‘Braefoot’ Hanson), Mrs G.P. Beinke (Booborowie) & Mrs H. Garrard (Mt Bryan East).  There are 18 grandchildren.  [Born as Friedricke Maria, married as Fridericke Maria and died as Fredericka Maria.]
