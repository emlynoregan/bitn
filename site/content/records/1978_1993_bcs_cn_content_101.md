A District Advisory Committee has been formed, with its first meeting tonight.  Mr Ray Jennison will chair the proceedings until officers are elected.  The aims of the body are:

To maintain an overview of community needs.

To analyse such needs through discussion, study and survey.

To provide a forum for the discussion of ideas.

To suggest ways that organisations can take actions separately or collectively.

To sponsor actions themselves when they are too large for individual organisations.

To serve as a clearing house for dates and information about services and voluntary activities.

To liaise closely with the Burra Burra DC on community needs and opinions.

A list of participating people is printed.
