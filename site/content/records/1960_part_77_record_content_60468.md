Obituary.  A Notice to Creditors reveals the death of Henry Rex Dasborough, farmer and grazier of WA, on 28 June 1971. [He was born 12 July 1905 Findon and on 30 May 1936 married Lurline Nelly Tiver born 8 September 1911 at Redruth to George Samuel Tiver and Ellen Tiver nee Kelly.  This connects him to the descendants of James Llewellyn Tiver (1829-1909) in the Burra District.]
