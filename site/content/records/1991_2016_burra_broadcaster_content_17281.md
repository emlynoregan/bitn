The Burra Show is well supported by businesses and individuals, which helps make it a success.  There was lots to see and do. The Burra and Districts Obedience Dog Club put on two excellent demonstrations.  Their agility exercise was especially enjoyable to watch.

The Kangaroo Creek Road Show was also a great hit with the littlies. All told, it was a very enjoyable Burra Show Day.
