In the midst of all this Cr Hammond rose to a point of order and after the above had been resolved the Mayor and Cr Harris felt affronted by what he had said and called for a withdrawal of a remark he had made.  He did so.  Cr Woollacott then made a remark which he in turn had to withdraw.  He did so, but then Cr Riggs demanded he apologise as well.  Cr Woollacott did so, but in so doing said he thought it all ‘an absolute farce’.

There was a lengthy discussion about putting on Mr Voumard as a permanent hand which was eventually carried with Crs Riggs and Hammond against.

Mr Pickering waited on the Council with a request that the new Kooringa Tennis Club lease the land behind the bowling green.  Cr Harris demanded that no tennis be played on Sunday.  Cr Riggs wanted to know if the courts would be open to the general run of young people – yes.

Mr Pickering said the cost of 2 asphalt courts would be c. £120-£200 with fencing.

Cr Kellaway would agree to a 15 year lease at a peppercorn rent if a way through for a dray was left for access to the paddock.  The overseer said the court was the best feeding ground, but if there was a right of way it would not make too much difference to the horses.
