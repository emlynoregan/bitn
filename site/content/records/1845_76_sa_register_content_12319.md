Kooringa News, 27 April

Easter Holidays passed with more than the usual amusements.  A game of cricket was played on Friday and also on Monday, when a cricket club was started.  This could be second to none in the colony, as many of the hard-fisted miners who have become members are well used to the game.

On Friday there was also a hunt when C. Ware and a party of friends went out in a spring cart (tandem) on a turkey hunt on the Gum Creek Run.  A flock of seven emus were surrounded and one shot and picked up.  The party then got into the cart and pursued them helter-skelter over rocks, wombat holes and stones for several miles.  One eventually dropped, tired.  This was shot and picked up.  This was repeated till five had been captured, the last one alive.  Not wishing to tire the horses further, they them went to the Cross Roads Inn.  Here two horsemen went off to capture the last two; one of which was taken alive.  The two live ones are now at the Burra Hotel, where Mr Ware is attempting to tame them.

On Monday the annual races took place at the Dry Hill, or Cross Roads, when all who were not engaged at cricket or at the Wesleyan Sunday School tea meeting, were assembled.  There was a good turnout.  There was also a procession of the Redruth Tradesmen and Minersâ€™ Club, who afterwards took part in a dinner at the Court House Hotel.

A branch of the National Bank of Australasia was opened here this week in premises lately occupied by Mr Leon.  It is likely to do well, as they are very willing to accommodate the tradespeople here, who in turn, once they become accustomed to it, will do all their business there.  A number of accounts have already been opened.
