The Haymakers, Cantata was performed at the Institute last Wednesday evening.  They played to a crowded house.  The orchestra of a dozen or so did a good job, but a few more performers would allow a bit more dash and emphasis where the composer called for it.  All in all it was a grand performance and much praise is due to Rev. Geddes-White.
