Burra Hospital.  Phase II of the redevelopment will begin next Monday.  Work on this phase should be completed early in the New Year.  The casualty room has recently been repainted and a new automatic sterilizer installed.  Asbestos & vinyl tiles have been laid in the Midwifery Section on the floors of the four private rooms and the Labour Ward.  Effluent from the septic tank has been directed into a recently sunk bore.  Phase III of the redevelopment should follow immediately.
