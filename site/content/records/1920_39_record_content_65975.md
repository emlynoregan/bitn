Burra Rifle Club will be 30 years old in a few weeks.  Six original members remain and three of those were members of the earlier club formed in 1890 and which went into recess in 1904.  The first Captain was G. Lord.  A challenge issued 13 years ago by Burra began what is now the Country Championship, though Burra has not always been represented.  This year a team of 20 went on Saturday in five cars.  In the team event Pt Pirie won with an average of 96 per man.  Burra averaged 92 and finished 5 out of 10.  Top scorer for the outing was H.H. Byles 97 with Reg. Barty, P.W. Hogan & A.C. Aughey on 96 each.
