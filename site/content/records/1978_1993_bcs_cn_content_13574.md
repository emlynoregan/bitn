The Burra Lutheran Congregation has placed a cairn with an appropriate plaque on it near the Court House.  It commemorates the site of the first Lutheran Church in the town, the ruins of which lie nearby.

[Note that the ruins have since been totally removed.  Some of the stone was incorporated into the western wall of the old Court House Hotel when work was subsequently done there.  The cairn is on the west side of Sancreed Street between Helston and St Just Streets.]
