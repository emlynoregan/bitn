On 16 May P. Murrie became the proprietor and editor.  The style of the editorials changes, though it is not clear whether Murrie wrote the leading articles or merely supervised Hardy more carefully as they continue to be quite left wing.  The arguments seem to become rather more moderate and the prose more coherent.  Some of the other leading articles seem still to read like Hardy and there are several noms de plume that must be him.  He is certainly the ‘Erratic Correspondent’ and very likely ‘Ajax’ and possibly others as well.
