Burra Town Council, 7 February

SAR cannot at present repair the Station Road due to a lack of bitumen.

SAR is considering a gateway for vehicular traffic across the line opposite the water tank.

Cr Kellaway considered such a crossing would be unsafe.

Council will inspect the site before replying to the letter.

The Salvage Commission wrote about the desirability of a local committee.

They will be informed that Council considers the present collection system is efficient.

The Mayor thought many old houses in the town should be rebuilt and made suitable for men returning from the war.

Council will use one of its free nights for use of the Hall for the Legacy Orphans Appeal.
