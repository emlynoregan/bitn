Goyder Council

Will investigate the feasibility of establishing a regular maintenance program for white ant treatment of street trees.

Will discuss with Transport SA its concerns about safety issues at the junction of Kooringa Road and the Goyder Highway and also of Young Street and the Highway opposite Thamm’s Garage.

Has given up plans for possibly leasing part of the Landore Street Depot now used by the Department of Environment and Heritage because of costs and will now consider either redesigning its present depot or relocating it.
