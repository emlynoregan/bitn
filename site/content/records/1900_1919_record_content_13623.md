Court.

Andrew Bishop, D.R. Jones, and James Gully were fined for failing to send a child to school as required.

Lucy Gully was fined 2/6 + 10/- costs for a stray cow in Best Place, Aberdeen.

David Corbett Lyons sued Francis H. Ford for keeping his dog and a swag.  The details go on for a column, but the case was decided for the defendant who also got 5/6 in a counter claim with costs.
