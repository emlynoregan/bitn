Accident/Obituary.  An accident occurred to the Burra mail cart crossing the River Light on the Adelaide side of Kapunda.  The mail cart from Burra on Monday evening crossed without trouble.  Mr Opie’s coach an hour later became jammed against the bank when the horses turned round in the stream.  The passengers endured the position all night and were released in the morning without injury.  The driver, William Newman and a passenger known as Billy the Pieman managed to escape during the night and reached the Adelaide side.

On Tuesday morning the Burra mail from Adelaide dared not cross the swollen stream and was delayed from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.  Then a man crossed from the north on horseback without apparent difficulty.  The mail arrived from Adelaide driven by John Nash and William Newman and Billy got seats on the mail cart to return to the Kapunda side.  The man who had crossed attached his horse to the four on the cart and was ridden by the man as pilot.  While they were crossing strong flows of water seem to have suddenly come down.  There swept away the leading horse and its rider, but both managed to reach the Kapunda side.  The cart and its four horses were swept downstream.  The driver and three passengers, Messrs George Pyke of the Hamilton Hotel, Mr Charles Ware of Kooringa and Mr Joseph Genders of Kooringa managed to save their lives, but William Newman, Billy the Pieman and two passenger were drowned.  One of the latter was Dr Hamer, late of Kapunda, but the other name we have not ascertained.  The four horses, worth £100 were also drowned.  Up to yesterday the bodies had not been recovered.  The Burra Mail arrived in town between 6 and 7 last evening.  The Government is bound, we believe, to extend the utmost leniency to mail contractors in respect to over-time at the present season.  In a country where roads are in a miserable condition and there are virtually no bridges infraction of the regulated time must often be beyond the power of the contractor to prevent.
