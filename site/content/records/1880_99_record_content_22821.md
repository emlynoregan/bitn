The New Paper, Our Commonwealth, is still raving at anyone who will buy it.  The editor is a believer in free thought and socialism and aims, it appears, to set class against class.  For a man to call another a loafer because he has been saving and accumulated a little wealth is mean.  I do not approve of land speculators, but a man who has been careful and made money from the proceeds of land is not to be called a loafer.
