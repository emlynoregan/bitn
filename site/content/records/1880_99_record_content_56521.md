Burra Town Council, 3 April.

This was a very acrimonious meeting.

Cr Hardyâ€™s report on Public Works was not received and complaints of the smell from boiling down in Aberdeen continue to be received.  The central Board of Health has ordered it stopped within 24 hours.  The new by-law was severely criticised.

Full report next issue.
