The Burra Show

There were record breaking pavilion entries and the return of farm machinery to help the 2014 show to its success.  There was a new look lay-out that added to the carnival atmosphere.  The crowd looked to be about the same size as in 2013, but actual figures are not yet available.  The weather was perfect.  School entries were outstanding.  Events like the Ute Muster, the Famers’ Challenge and Show Jumping Dogs provided something for everyone.  Ramsey Bros. brought machinery from Riverton, making it the first time I more than 20 years that there was machinery on show.  There were many more horses and the poultry and pigeons filled their shed with about 600 entries.  Shearing entries were slightly down, but competition was fierce.  Local, Wayne O’Brien took out the Open Championship.

Mr Jock Duncan officially opened the show.  Life Memberships were awarded to Helen Stockman and Geraldine Smedley, while a posthumous Life Membership, awarded to Peter Reilly, was presented to Matt and James Reilly.

The Young Farmers’ Challenge was a great spectacle and provided much fun.  The winning team, Baldina Bale Busters, comprised Kobey Morris, Chris Rains, Marcus Fitzgerald and Brayden Hutchcraft.  Vanessa Thomas won Champion Ute, Best Presented and Best street Ute.  Barry Hool and daughter Wendy Meaney of Burra won Best Classic Ute.  [10 photos.]
