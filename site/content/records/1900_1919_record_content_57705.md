Burra Cheer-up Soc.

The Cheer-up Soc. sweet stall at the RSL Fete raised £13-13-0 clear.

Socks are still urgently needed for the front.

The Ladies’ band etc. welcomed Sgts Cecil Lord & Graham Dow at the station last Thursday.  The two were among the first 23 to enlist in 1914.

Next Friday an empty stall will be erected in front of Mr F. Harris’s shop and by the end of the day we hope it will be well stocked with donated pickles, sauces, jams, eggs, etc. for sending to Adelaide Cheer-up Hut.  Our last parcel of socks will be despatched on 11 December so please have all contributions in by 10 December.
