Burra Wesleyans have supported services at World’s End for about 12 months, first in Mr Duell’s house, and when that proved too small after about six months, at a large room in the vacant house of Mr Duldig’s.  On Easter Monday a tea meeting presided over by Mr Thomas McWaters attracted over 100 and it was resolved that if the present season proved propitious a chapel would be built at World’s End, during the year.
