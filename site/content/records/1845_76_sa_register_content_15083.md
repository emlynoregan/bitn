Rodda’s Patent for Reducing Ores

Under the ordinary smelting process the copper or other ore is melted, stone and metal together and as a consequence the whole mass has to be raised to the enormous temperature required for the fusion of the stony portions of the ore.  Under Mr Rodda’s system the stony portion is not fused at all.  The temperature is raised sufficiently to fuse the metallic portions of the ore so that they run into granules within the body of the stone, from which they are they separated by crushing and washing.  A company is in the process of formation with the view of erecting works at the Burra Mine to process ore by Mr Rodda’s process.  A vast quantity of ore has been accumulated there over the years because it is of too low a concentration of copper to be economical to smelt by the traditional method.  It is expected that a large profit can be made from its treatment.  Arrangements have been made between the promoters and the SA Mining Association for the transfer of some 50,000 tons of inferior ore at a low price.  The treatment of this ore would give value to what is now valueless to the colony.  If successful it could be expected that similar works would be erected in the far north mines where transport costs mean that at present only the richest ores are presently worth mining.
