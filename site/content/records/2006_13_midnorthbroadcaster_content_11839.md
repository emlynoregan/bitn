Aaron Niemz of Robertstown replies to the barrage of letters against wind farms in a letter of almost 1 column in which he responds to many of their concerns, indicating that he feels they are over-reacting.  He denies the visual impact and loss of amenity and disputes the effects of noise from the turbines, at least at the great distance of up to 10 km that have been claimed. He also doubts any drastic effect on property values.
