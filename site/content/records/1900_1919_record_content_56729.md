Pte Herb Riggs was given a welcome home social in the Cheer-up Hall last Saturday.  The report extends for over 1 column.  The Burra Brass Band attended as did the Burra Sporting & Athletic Club.  The social was largely attended and J. Drew presided in the absence of E.W. Crewes in Adelaide.  Pte Riggs received very serious wounds at Gallipoli and on recovering was sent to France where he was again seriously wounded, resulting in his return to Australia.  He has been awarded the Military Medal.
