Burra High School

Plans for a replacement High School were referred to the Public Works Standing Committee last Thursday.  The plans were to replace the High School buildings completely on a new 20 acre site about half a mile from the present site.  The present school is in inadequate buildings on a small site shared with the Primary School, the Minister for Education, Hugh Hudson, said.  The new school is planned to be built around a square courtyard with versatile open space, specialist teaching areas and science labs and a library resource centre.  There will be provisions for Home science, Needlework, Woodwork, Metalwork and Typing, along with administration, a shelter/activity area and a canteen shell.  The new school is designed for up to 200 students.  The transfer would allow the whole of the existing school for use by the Primary School, enabling substantial improvements.
