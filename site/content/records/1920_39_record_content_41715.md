Mongolata Goldfield

Last week directors of Byles’ Mongolata No. 1 Goldmining Co. visited the field (Messrs Milne, I.J. Warnes, Thornton, Reed, Boothby, Hayman, Campbell & Evans (secretary).)  We understand they intend to put a battery on the field as soon as water is available.  A site has been found for the bore.

The Secretary of Wildildie Co. (Alwin Pearce) says that the 10/- shares are going rapidly and should be exhausted this week.

Golden Harp £5 syndicate shares are selling for up to £10.

Good reports generally continue to cone in.
