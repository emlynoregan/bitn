Friends of the Heysen Trail planted about 600 trees adjacent to Dutton’s Trough Road near World’s End over the weekend.  They planted local varieties of eucalypts, acacias, casuarinas and melaleucas, which had been grown by a Trees for Life volunteer.  About 40 walkers from Friends of the Heysen Trail assisted.
