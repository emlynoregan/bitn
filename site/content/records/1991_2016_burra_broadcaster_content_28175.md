Burra Cultural Centre Committee is currently looking for a project manager to establish a telecentre at the Town Hall.  Their Chair Leonie Fretwell said they were also finalising the agreement paperwork with Networking the Nation funding.

The Mary Warnes Room is being upgraded with a stylish paint job, new carpeting and curtains.

The next stage will see the upgrading of the kitchen with a gas hot water system, a commercial stove and commercial dishwasher.
