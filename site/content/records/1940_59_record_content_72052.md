The Burra North boys turned out for a practice game on Saturday.

‘The older boys with the spring handled bat presented and repaired by Mr R. Fuss, the handle bound by Mr Hunt and the cricket ball presented by Mr David Sara, all had a good game.’

The younger boys played with a smaller bat on another part of the field.  The match played against Burra on the oval resulted in a draw.
