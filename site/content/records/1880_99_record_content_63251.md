Half of page 3 was taken up with repeated advertising material posing as stories, but really selling Mother Seigel’s Syrup, or Clement’s Tonic, Eucalypti Extract (Sander & Sons Eucfetus Extract), and Dr Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People.

Town Council activity was apparently uncontroversial in 1897, but meetings were barely reported.  Tenders are noted and the state of accounts are reported, but little else.

Sporting reports are scanty and seemingly inconsistently reported.

Sparks which originally gave cryptic remarks on local events degenerated into a few local references interspersed with jokes from some printed source, some of them being recycled as the year progressed.

Page 4 continued to be dominated by large advertisements; many not local.

All in all the paper ceases to be a record of town life in the sense that it had been at least up to the mid 1890s and even more so in earlier years.

There is little follow through with items.

Minor matters before the courts are dealt with in a mocking humour – especially those involving excessive alcohol.

Spelling and grammatical mistakes, while not rife, are not infrequent.  The non-agreement of subject and verb being, perhaps, the most striking of the latter.

For much of the year some fiction in the form of a serial story was included on page 3, but not continually.  Items of original poetry were fairly common.

Letters to the editor were uncommon.

A strange form of advertising is the long columns of small print which masquerade as either news or short stories of one sort or another, and which are repeated unchanged for weeks.  Surely no one ever read them, at least after their first appearance, but they sought to sell such things as Mother Seigel’s Syrup or Dr Williams’ Pink Pills.
