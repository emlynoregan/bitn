The Lane-Robertson & Co. Burra-Arltunga Prospecting Syndicate

W.H. Hardy writes to contradict John Lane’s version of the recent prospecting trip to the NT.

He claims Mr John Lane has publicly set forth untrue issues relating to the failure of the recent prospecting trip, but that Hardy is willing at any time to meet any shareholders and prove the bona fides of the party and he says their claims against the managing director were just and honest.

[Note that the Record does not appear to have published any of Lane’s statements, though Hardy was reported at length in the papers of 1 April & 8 April.]
