Burra Co. VF.  A good number of members of the company attended the review in Adelaide.  It turned out to be a tame affair due to poor weather and low attendance.  The planned sham fight was cancelled.

The company will be inspected by Gen. Downes on Tuesday 26 June at 3 p.m.  Attendance is necessary to qualify for efficiency for the year.
