Burra Town Council.

T.F. Robertson wrote suggesting the crossing near Gully’s [i.e. The White Hart ford] be lowered two feet.

Cr Lane said that fell in with the Council’s own ideas.

Five boys have wilfully damaged the wall at Victoria Park and the little door in the gate.

The reservoir overseer asks if the Council wants the old metal taken out in the enlargement at 1/- a load.  Crs Radford and Lane said it would be a bargain.

Letter from ‘Britisher’, Kooringa, 15 June, complaining that the Burra District Council gave a tender to a ‘German councillor’s son in preference to the Britisher on the ground that the lowest tenderer had no horses, at the same time he would have employed a man that had a team and had to struggle to feed them as well as the councillor.’

[The last phrase reads oddly, but the general tenor of the complaint is both clear and typical of the time.]
