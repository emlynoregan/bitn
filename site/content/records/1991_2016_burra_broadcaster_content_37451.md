Market Square & Best Place Redevelopment

The petition against the changes in Market Square is growing.  Opponents say:

The money could be better spent on kerbing, lighting or sewer extension.

Fewer parking spaces are unacceptable.

Footpaths and drains, especially in Burra North are more urgent items of expenditure.

The present arrangement is quite acceptable.

The Editor, Terry Wilson did some fence-sitting with his comments:

He had looked at the plans and liked the look of them.

BUT the rather belated opposition might just have a point if the changes are likely to lead to an increase in Burra rates.

Although the plans have merit, he is unconvinced and has an open mind.

He goes on to suggest other changes that are possible or desirable, perhaps in the long term:

The trees at the southern entrance to the town are unsightly and past their use-by date.  They should be renewed.

Burra Caravan Park would be better located at Burra North between the old Court House and the creek.

Leighton Cricket Oval [i.e. Aberdeen Oval] would be better redeveloped as a site for the concentration of sporting activities: the football oval, the bowling club and the showgrounds.  This would open the spaces those activities presently occupy for housing development/retirement housing.

[There is some irony in the suggestion to move the Burra Show to the Aberdeen Oval, since it was somewhat controversial to move it from there in 1923.]
