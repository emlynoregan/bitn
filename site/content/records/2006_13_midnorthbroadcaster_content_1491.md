BCS.  Gladstone High & BCS are both in the top ten for keeping boys at school between Years 8 and 12.

Best in SA was Norwood-Morialta with 99.4%.  Gladstone H.S. achieved 77.9% and BCS 75.7%.

Over the whole state the retention of boys was 64% and for girls was 84%.

BCS Principal Jim Low said school-based apprenticeships had proven to be a great pathway for many boys to remain at school, but also get involved in the workforce.
