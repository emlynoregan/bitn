West Burra Copper Mine.  7th Half-Yearly Meeting.

Work has been continuous and while not particularly profitable the returns have been sufficient to keep the men fully employed.  We began the period with £54-10-9 and ore sales brought in £386-15-4.  Expenses were £309-3-3, leaving a balance of £132-2-10.

Prospects remain encouraging.  Stoping work has been done at the 50, 100 & 146’ levels with most ore coming from the 50’ level.  We believe the main body of ore is below the water table and the mine merits much further development.
