Burra Burra Copper Co.  Report from the Deputation to the Directors.

Mr Crewes presided at the meeting at the Institute on Thursday evening.

It has been rumoured that the manager of the Electro-Magnetic Works had instructions to call tenders for clearing out the creek leading from the open cut.  Dr Sangster had waited on the manager, Mr Marriott, who confirmed that it was so.

The results of the conference with the directors were reported by Dr Sangster:

The directors will consider dewatering the mine to a certain level.

The directors are favourable to a number of tributers working in the mine.

The directors will consider reducing the royalty paid by tributers: those present being favourable.

The directors have confidence in the work of Messrs Snow & Elder.

In the event of unwatering the mine Mr Snow’s rights would not be a hindrance.

Profit arising from treatment of orey matter by the magnetic process would be used to develop the mine up to £10,000.

We are satisfied that the options being pursued are the best in the interests of shareholders generally.

The report was received.

The hard-headed business attitude he felt was absent and the directors were anxious to help as much as possible.  They said they were surprised the royalty was currently 5/- in the £1 and one said he thought it was 2/6 in the £1.  They were quite in earnest re the unwatering of the mine.  E.W. Crewes was encouraged by the creek clearing and hoped the meeting might soon bear fruit in terms of employment.

Rev. Murphy said it was Mr Snow’s idea that had encouraged the directors to buy the mine.  Mr Snow was willing to erect an electric pump to the existing structure to reduce the water level.  If work proceeds in earnest a crusher will be erected to the advantage of tributers.  Of course Mr Snow would be paid for treating the ore.  Directors were out to foster tributers.  Directors did not intend developing the mine until the tailings had been treated.  Messrs Snow & Elder had a time limit to start treating the tailings by 13 July.  If the mine was unwatered to 50 fathoms at least 300 could be employed.

Rev. Murphy thought it would help the tributers if they got together and formed a sort of company.

Mr Sanders didn’t think that idea would work.

[Personal note: this may be Mr John Sanders, my great-grandfather, who worked as a tributer at the mine after it closed.]
