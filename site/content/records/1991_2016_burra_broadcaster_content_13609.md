Letter.  Gus Wenzel, Deputy Principal of BCS writes expressing disappointment and dismay at the senseless acts of vandalism and theft that plague the school, of which three recent examples are:

The SRC Forum run and controlled drink machine at the entrance to the school gym was broken into and the money mechanism completely destroyed, despite the fact that it had a sign saying: not in use – no cans – no money.

Two large 1500 watt globes used to floodlight the old school building were stolen – worth $62 each.

Agricultural chicken shed was entered and hydroponics lights stolen.
