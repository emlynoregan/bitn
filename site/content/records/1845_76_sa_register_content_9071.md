Kooringa Farewell to Mr William Paxton

On Wednesday 2 May about 50 gentlemen attended a dinner at the Burr Hotel to honour Mr Paxton who is about to return to England.  Dr Mayne took the chair at 7 oâ€™clock.  Among those present were: Mr Jaffrey (a Director), Captain Roach, G.S. Kingston MLC (a Director), John Morphett MLC (a Director), Henry Ayers, John Newman, Henry Noltenius, G.H. Fox and several other gentlemen from Adelaide and residents of Kooringa.

Among those present the report also names Mr C. Ware, Mr Barker, Mr Challoner, Mr Robert Cowper, Mr Powell, Captain Matthews, Mr Pearce, Mr Edlin, Inspector Gardner and Mr George Bennett.

Mr Challoner proposed the health of Mr Paxton.  He said Mr Paxton was well known as a large holder of property in Kooringa, who had done much for the interests of the township and had always exerted himself to encourage the sports of the colony.  He was for a considerable time the owner of the racehorse Highflyer.  He wished him and his family a happy and pleasant voyage to England.

Mr Paxton in replying said he was proud to have been associated with the Mine since its start.  He had seen the first pick struck and had since noted its steady progression.  Had it not been for the Burra SA would not be in the position it was today.  He did not take credit to himself for what he had done for the Burra, as he had done it to benefit himself as well as others.
