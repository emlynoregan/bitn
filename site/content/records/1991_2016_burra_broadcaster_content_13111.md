Regional Council of Goyder

The new council reduced its elected from 29 on amalgamation to 13 at the council election.  Valid votes were cast by 2330 of the 3,652 persons eligible: a 63.8% response.  A further 90 invalid votes were received with the declaration flap removed or incorrectly completed.  44 envelopes also came in too late to be counted.  This may have affected the outcome in Eudunda Ward, where there was a tie after the distribution of preferences, between R. Leditschke and J. Wibberley.  Returning officer Stephen Kerrigan then had to draw a name ‘out of the hat’ to decide the candidate to be excluded.  Mr Wibberley’s name was drawn out.
