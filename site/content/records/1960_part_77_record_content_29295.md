Redruth Methodist Church

Last Sunday the Rev. H. Alvey dedicated the new electronic Hammond organ to the memory of the late Edwin and Hilda Finch.  He was assisted by Rev. M. Lind.  The organ was presented to the church by the sons of the deceased, Norman and Murray Finch.  The organist, Mrs J. Oates, brought out the full capabilities of the organ in a first class manner.  The occasion was the culmination of the church’s 115th Anniversary celebrations.  Rev. Alvey was the guest speaker, having been the circuit minister 1924-27.  At the public meeting last night he presented his informative address on Burra – its Mines and Methodism, which he had presented first to the Methodist Historical Society in 1960.
