Mr Lloyd Parks saw two young males in his yard at about 11.40 p.m.  They fled on hearing his approach and Mr Parks found that a car belonging to his neighbour, Mr Brian Mitchell, had been pushed into the street and attempts had been made to start it.  Sgt Orford was notified and about 12.05 a.m. he heard attempts to start a vehicle in Ware St. where a car had been pushed from the home of Mr & Mrs Bill Byles.  The would-be thieves escaped.  On Saturday evening a ute owned by T. Ryan of Mt Bryan was left on the side of the road four miles south of Hallett when it had a flat tyre.  It was subsequently stolen and apparently driven with the flat tyre until abandoned a mile south of Yunta.
