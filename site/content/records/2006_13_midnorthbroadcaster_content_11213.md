Burra National Trust has been able to use a grant of $400,000 from the Commonwealth Stimulus Package to carry out much needed maintenance and restoration work on the Redruth Gaol, Police Lock-up, the old Police House, the Market Square Museum, the Courthouse and the Bon accord Museum.  A number of old items of farm equipment have been removed from Kotz’s cottage to the Bon Accord Museum site.  Work has included:

Bon accord site – stone work, roofing and gutters

Police Lock-up – substantial stone work and electrical work

Redruth Gaol – about 1 km of pointing and stone work and new pathways around the courtyard.

More than 22 labourers and tradesmen were employed from local and surrounding areas, with most of the materials being locally sourced.
