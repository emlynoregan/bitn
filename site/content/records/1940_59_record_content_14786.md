Visit of a Lancaster Bomber.  The visiting bomber, which was recently flown from England to Australia by an Australian crew created great interest.  It flew over the town on Tuesday almost at roof height.  The noise of its four engines was deafening as it showered the town with recruiting leaflets for the RAAF & WAAAF.  It circled the town twice before heading for Clare.
