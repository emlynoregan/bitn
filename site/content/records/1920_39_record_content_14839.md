Burra Town Council

Trustees of the Redruth Methodist Church invite Councillors to the opening of the new Sunday school.

Cr Woollacott had approved the top dressing of the Aberdeen Tennis Courts after talking to several Councillors.  Cr Kellaway objected, saying there was a committee for that.

Cr Woollacott cited the necessity of holidays for his action and believed there was precedent.

Various minor works were approved.

Cr Riggs said the Bon Accord Bridge was very dangerous.  Three motor cyclists had been injured and a danger sign was needed.  Carried.

Rain.  Thunder storms broke last Sunday & Monday and 68 points fell in 12 hours.  Falls to the east were good generally with recordings of between 56 and 100 points.  In Burra the electricity supply was cut for a few seconds on two occasions by the lightning.

The Croquet Club now has 29 members.  On a recent visit to Clare one Burra pair were victorious and the other drew.

Tennis.  On 10 January: Copperhouse 8-67 defeated Hallett 7-73.
