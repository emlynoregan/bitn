A Picture of Burra in 1879 is on show in our window.  It shows two roads leading to Redruth – the bottom one mostly used, but when goods had to be taken from the old shop of Bath and Pearce, (now W.L. Seabury’s) an embankment of 8-10’ had to be negotiated from a point near the National Bank.  Buildings shown are much the same except alterations are going on in the shop now occupied by Messrs C. & F. Streicher and the residence of Dr Sangster jun. has replaced ‘an old rookery showing a house with a paling roof and fence in front which seems to have come in contact with one of the much-talked-of- bullock teams’.
