Mr R. Fuss has suggested putting louvre windows at each end of the flower pavilion at the showgrounds.  He is the Head Steward and Convenor of the Flower Section.  If the Show Committee can collect sufficient money to purchase the materials at cost, Mr Fuss has offered to do all the necessary work.  The suggestion would certainly improve both ventilation and light.
