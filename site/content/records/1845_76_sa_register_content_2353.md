Adelaide Share Market

Burra Burra £5 shares have reached £185 cash and there are more buyers at that price and £220 has been given in a six months’ bill.

Princess Royal £50 shares paid to £37 have a present price of £42.

[A correspondent had evidently posed the question whether the discovery of the Burra Burra Mine had an injurious effect on other mining venture.  The paper printed a reply to the suggestion.]

An injurious effect might at first glance seem likely, but in fact less successful operations have been supported by the diffusion of wealth generated by the Burra Burra Mine.  The result has been to stimulate enterprise.  The writer says he has not visited the mine, but believes the ores is not found in lodes, but rather in what is termed a ‘broil’ in which the ore is interspersed, but not continuously.  Whereas lodes generally widen as they descend, a broil terminates suddenly.  Sand is a bad sign of such termination and is believed to have been found at Burra Burra.  Nevertheless the ore in sight and in certainty will suffice the present generation.
