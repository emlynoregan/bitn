Burra Rifle Club held its AGM in the RSL Rooms on Saturday.

Captain Collins said it was the 35th annual report, the last annual meeting having been held on 12 July 1941 since when the club had been in recess for six years and even in 1941 there had been no competitive shooting.  In that year the club had mainly been helping the VDC on the rifle range, helping generally with their shooting lessons and, he thought, giving over £5 from their funds before going into recess.  Activity this year had only been for approximately three months following permission to restart the club.  He believed they were one of the first to get going again, but they had found the pits, butts, mounds, targets and telephone lines required a lot of attention.  Thanks to Life Member J.E. Pearce for overseeing this work and for renovating and completely overhauling the target frames.  When shooting began we found our rifles with one or two exceptions were hopeless.  Mr Marston has helped us to overcome this problem.  He thanked also the secretary, Mr R.G. Bernhardt; the Armourer, Mr Alick Ford; the Treasurer, Mr Hogan; the Telephone Mechanic, Mr Thomas and the Telephone Linesman, Mr Preiss.  The only inter-club match was against Clare on 16 June, which Burra won easily, partly due to the fact that most Clare shooters did not have aperture sights.  Membership stands at c. 75 of which 56 are financial.

The treasurer’s statement showed them to be in a sound financial position.

The Mayor then presented trophies:

Main Handicap Trophy	R.G. Bernhardt

Marksman’s Trophy	P.W. Hogan

Highest Aggregate for new members over 21	I. Burdon

Highest Aggregate for new members under 21	R.R. Bevan

300 yards	E.C. Hopkins

500 yards	Ron Kellock

600 yards	F.T. Marston

700 yards	J.H. Schwier

Highest Score Opening Day	P.W. Hogan

Elected were: Captain, E.C. Collins; Vice-Captain, P.W. Hogan; Secretary, R.G. Bernhardt, Treasurer, P.W. Hogan & Armourer, A.C. Ford.
