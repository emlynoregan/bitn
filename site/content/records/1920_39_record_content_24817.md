Burra Hospital.

The new isolation ward, built by T.H. Woollacott & Sons at an elevated site at the rear of the hospital is now complete.  There are four wards for patients and a passage running through from end to end dividing the wards from a most convenient kitchenette and comfortable nurses’ sitting and bed room on the opposite side.  There is bathroom and lavatory accommodation, a telephone and electric light.  The whole is surrounded by a 10ft verandah which can be converted into additional accommodation in emergency.  The rooms have French windows and attention has been given to fly-proof doors and windows.  Furnishing is modern and generous.  The total cost including furnishings is £1,750.  About £650 of this comes from donations from James Gallagher and the late Henry Thomas who left a legacy for the purpose.  There was a gift of £100 from W.G. Hawkes, various other donations and a £ for £ Government subsidy.  Two of the wards will be named after the two largest donors.  Carpentry work was by Edgar Pearce and final preparation of plans was by Mr Guy St-J. Makin: architect of Adelaide.  [There was no official opening.]
