There are more hotels in these towns than in Kooringa because there the land is on leasehold from the mining company and the landlord will not allow more than three hotels.  In Redruth and Aberdeen they are built on freehold land.

The surrounding country is undulating and hilly.  All timber within 20 miles has been cut and used on the mine.  Not a tree can be seen within five miles and beyond that only on long purchased property.

Redruth contains a commodious court house, a well-built gaol (the furthest north) capable of accommodating 30 prisoners, and a police station.  It also contains a Wesleyan, a German Lutheran and a Primitive Methodist Chapel.  There is a private licensed school of nearly 100 scholars.
