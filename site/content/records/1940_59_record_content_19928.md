In general the paper is a fairly good record of local activity, but there is relatively little reporting of sport, probably reflecting the reduced amount of sporting competition during the war.  There is a very large volume of not very interesting detail on the activities of the local Red Cross branches and the Fighting Forces Comforts Funds.  The ‘People We Know Column’ records the coming and goings of locals, including the military forces personnel on leave.  Generally this movement of locals has not been noted for any of the years that it was supplied, but in the war years movements of service personnel have been recorded.
