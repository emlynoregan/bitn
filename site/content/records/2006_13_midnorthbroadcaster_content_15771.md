A Rangelands Junior Youth Environment Forum recently involved students from BCS, Robertstown Primary and St Johnâ€™s Lutheran School, Eudunda.  They learned about lizard habitat and then used the information to construct a lizard lounge in the local community garden.  Plant terrariums were also constructed to illustrate how ecosystems worked.  JYEF is held once a term for Year 5-7 students.
