Wesley Bicentenary Church, Hanson.

Half the land now held by the trustees was obtained 30 years ago.  For 25 years services were held in the Council Chamber.  Mr Jesse Humphrys set the ball rolling four years ago with a donation of £20.  For two years the only addition was 24/- interest.  Then the Sunday school gave £1 and a tea meeting raised £3.  In 1902 the whole of the site now used was acquired for less than £11.  It was decided not to let tenders till two thirds of the estimated cost was raised, and to aim to open the church debt free.  A dinner, lectures and supper in October 1902 paid for the land, but by the end of the year still less than £50 had been raised.  Mr J. Pearce prepared the plans and specifications for free after the dimensions and style were agreed in January 1903.  The Hon. J.J. Duncan made Cross Roads Quarry available and 100 yards of stone was raised and carted the four miles free – equal to a donation of £25.  In June, finding no other church in Australia was to mark the Bicentenary of John Wesley’s birth, it was decided to call the building the Wesley Bicentenary Church.  Tenders were called in August and Mr J. Humphrys invited to lay the first of two memorial stones.  Though wet weather kept many away the ceremonies produced over £56.  Mr Humphrys had by now given £42 and offered £5 more if others would donate wheat – 7 bags were immediately offered and 16 subsequently.  Nearly £200 of the £250 needed had by then been raised.  A call was made to Methodists across Australia for a crown donation (5/-) to honour the Wesley Bicentenary and eventually 125 crowns were received. [£30-5-0]

The church comfortably seats 100 and is substantially built.  The masons were Messrs T. & C. Tiver, the carpenter Mr J. Pearce and the clerk of works was Mr P.B. James.  It was crowded on 20 December for the first services by Rev. W.F. James and Rev. T.B. Angwin.  One old lady in the congregation was born on the day of the Battle of Waterloo.  Tea and a public meeting on Christmas Day 1903 saw over 100 visitors from Burra and quite 300 altogether.  Messrs Bentley and Pearce took photographs.  The tea meeting raised £13.  Only the seats which cost £20 remain to be paid for.  This account was settled and with a £10 promise there was a balance of £20 towards a porch, fence, and other necessities which will cost £40.
