Burra Town Council, 9 August

Cr Sampson moved that all other South Ward work be stopped and they proceed only with kerbing on the south side of Commercial St and in Market Square.

The Mayor thought that this contravened earlier decisions and that the other South Ward councillor should have been present.  Cr Sampson said they couldn’t wait for ‘so dilatory a councillor’.

The mayor objected to this term, but Cr Sampson said he thought that a councillor who had been absent for more than three meetings and had not condescended to ask for leave was dilatory.  The matter was adjourned for two weeks.

The English and Australian Copper Co. is to be paid £12-10-0 for the deviation [road] through Llwchwr.
