Burra Town Council

DC of Mt Bryan wrote desiring the formation of a northern District Fire Fighting Association.  A decision was postponed until more particulars as to cost etc. are ascertained.

Sara & Co. wrote re removal of fencing to the proper boundary lines on lots 117, 118 & 119 between Taylor & Cooper Streets.  Side fence to be moved 21ft out and the front 8ft nearer the main road.  They wish to bring the lots under the RPA, but Council had been in possession so long it would use its own discretion as to granting of the application.  A decision was opposed until inspection.

[The Main Road concerned is Watt Rd and lots are three that adjoin immediately south of Watt Rd.]
