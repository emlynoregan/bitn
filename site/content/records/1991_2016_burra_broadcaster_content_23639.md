Editorial: Burra’s Place in History

What has the Centenary of Federation to do with Burra?  Burra was one of the most important towns in the country.  It made a significant contribution to the economic development of SA and to many parts of Australia.  It was world famous and produced a number of influential people.

One such was Sir Frederick William Holder.  He came to Burra as a schoolteacher and became headmaster of the Kooringa Public School.  Later he bought the Burra Record, was its editor and Mayor of Burra.  He was then prominent in state politics before becoming the first Speaker of the House of Representatives and died in Parliament after an all night sitting.  Did you know we have an oil painting of the great man?  It is a tremendous link between Burra and Federation.  The Regional Council of Goyder has been given a grant for the celebration of the Centenary of Federation.  There will soon be a meeting to decide what to do about this.  A few months ago I suggested a walk of fame either in Market Square or by the Town Hall.  Put your thinking caps on and come to the public meeting when it is announced.
