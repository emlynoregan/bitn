Editorial on Federation.  Mr Reid (NSW) wants to make some slight alterations and additions to the accepted scheme before resubmitting it to his electors.  NSW agreement is vital so either Mr Reid’s proposals will have to be put to all or the present Bill put to NSW again.  The latter would be preferable.

J. Sampson, the Mayor, has influenza.

Referendum Results for SA

YES	35,761

NO	17,305

The cost of the referendum was estimated at £3,500.

Rain.  Some good falls have been recorded in the last few days.

Burra Hospital has put on an extra nurse on account of having more patients.
