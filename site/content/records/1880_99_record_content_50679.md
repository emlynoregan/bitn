Burra Town Council.

Some more destitution has been relieved.

Cr Parks moved his motion charging The Record with misrepresenting Councillors and misleading ratepayers.

Cr Harris said that when he read the report he was ashamed of the Council and that people would think we were behaving like schoolboys.  It was a good thing the report had omitted what Cr Linkson had said about the quarries.

Cr Walsh thought the only omission was that Cr Parks’s name was not shown as seconder to his motion.

Cr Linkson said ‘It is strange that Councillor Parks has been the real champion of the Burra Record for the past eighteen months, and now turns dog on it.’  He attributed this change to personal motives.

Cr Hardy then got into the act and eventually the motion was carried on the Mayor’s casting vote (supporting Crs Hardy, Parks and Harris.)

Cr Linkson then moved that in future all Councillors would write down their own speeches to be forwarded to the Record for publication, but of course the quartet of Parks, Hardy, Harris and Rabbich would not allow that to pass.

The editor goes on to say that a specially printed pamphlet will be prepared ‘for the memorable event’.
