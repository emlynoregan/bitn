The Cake Fair exhibits were very good with a very large variety of all manner of desserts as well as cakes.  Vocal and instrumental items accompanied the display.  At 9 o’clock the items were auctioned.  The door takings amounted to £5.  Mrs Both won ten first prizes and the bracelet that was offered for that distinction.
