Burra North FFCF held its AGM.  Secretary, Miss A. Bentley reported they had had meetings on the second and fourth Thursdays of each month.  Membership had started at 65 and ended at 70 for the year.  A number of members had adopted a ‘boy’ and corresponded with them, also becoming responsible for that particular ‘boy’s’ Christmas parcel.  Instead of an annual drive in 1944, the FFCF combined with the Red Cross to hold a Gala Day at the Showgrounds in October.  The pie cart had operated until December and the Burra North FFCF had two sale days for that period, raising £10-4-9.  The 1945 Drive has just ended.  This year it took the form of a ‘Pin Up Girl’ Contest, in which the Burra North candidate was Mrs Lotus Twist.  The Unit raised £99-10-8 independent of her committee’s efforts.  Goods made and sent to Headquarters this year were: 240 pairs of socks, 5 pairs of seaboot stockings, 20 pullovers, 40 mufflers, 3 pairs mittens, 182 face-washers, 1 bundle of gun cleaners.  A large quantity of books and magazines was also despatched.
