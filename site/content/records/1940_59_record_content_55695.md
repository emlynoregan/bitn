Burra Town Council, 21 July

The Minister of Education advises that the contractor will start work on the Burra Schoolyard on 17 August.

J.A.S. Fisher tendered his resignation as Corporation Representative on the Burra High School Council and the Burra Institute Committee in view of the implied vote of no confidence at the last meeting.  This was not accepted and he was asked to reconsider the resignation.

Mr Tillett is requested to either renovate or demolish the house on the corner of Kingston St and Bridge Terrace.

H.J.B. Jennison and C.H. Cummins of Burra Progress Assoc. waited on the Council and suggested the entrance to the Town Hall needed redecorating and they said their Assoc. was prepared to assist the proposed Burra Caravan Park in any way.
