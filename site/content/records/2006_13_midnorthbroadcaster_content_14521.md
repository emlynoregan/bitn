Lis Jones Ingman organised a collection of watercolour paintings and drawings of Burra, which were on show at Shared Arts Studio in Chapel Street on 12 April.  The next stop for the collection will be Felenne in Belgium on 22 April.  Burra Arts society added to the works painted by Lis and the Burra History Group produced a card showing a photograph of Belgian Flag Day in Burra in 1915.  Taken in Market Square, the photograph shows the great support for Belgian war refugees at that time.
