Stockman Electronics was the successful tenderer for the provision of 45 new computers to BCS in a major upgrade of information technology at the school.  Principal Rob Knight said the tender was worth $60,000 and was affordable by leasing rather than buying the equipment.  A further $5,000 will be spent on expanded network cabling.
