Burra Visitor Centre

The National Trustâ€™s lease expires at the end of the year and it is unwilling to renew the lease following significant financial losses over a number of years.  Goyder Council has refused to commit further funding without demonstrated financial support from the community.  Without such support there is real danger the centre could close at the end of the year and BRTBA President Sue Ryan said they felt that would be extremely detrimental to the community.  The Council has a working party under Andrew Gebhardt to find a solution.  Mrs Ryan said the Burra Tourism Association expressed in principle support for taking a share of the management role of the centre.  Elly Nicholls and Michael Hamilton have been staffing the centre during the week in recent times.  Michael, the present manager, has just accepted a position with the Victor Harbor City Council as Tourism Marketing Officer, beginning in a couple of weeks.
