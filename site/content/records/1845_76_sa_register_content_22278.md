Burra News, 19 August

On 29 July the McCulloch Bros. of Black Rock ordered a man named Alexander Alexander to take four valuable horses and a wagon loaded with skins to Kooringa.  He was to take the team a short distance to Princess Royal, belonging to Mr McCulloch and allow them to rest for a few days before returning to the station with a load.  He disobeyed almost all those orders.  He put the horses into the Burra Hotel stables for three days, during which he was quite intoxicated.  He then obtained the loading from Messrs Drew & Co.  Among the load was a case of rum and another of bottled ale.  When he failed to return on schedule a search was made and he was discovered half way back to Black Rock in a state of intoxication, having consumed all the rum and all but 17 bottles of ale.  He had also lost the horses.  They were discovered with the harness partly on and the knees of one broken, seven miles from home.  On the return journey to the station he drank the remaining 17 bottles of ale.  A barrel of tar and other articles to the value of £7 were missing from the load.  When brought before Mr MacDermott SM last Monday at Burra, he was sentenced to two months’ hard labour at Redruth Gaol.
