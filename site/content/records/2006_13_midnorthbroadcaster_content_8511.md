St Joseph’s Church, Burra was the focus of much attention last Wednesday morning when work began on the installation of a new spire, which had been absent from the tower for almost four decades.  With the help of a crane local tradesmen first removed the cross and the existing timber platform from inside the church tower.  They then installed the first of three section fabricated at Ashmore Engineering, Farrell Flat.  The first piece was a six metre tall base, which fits inside the tower.  Some slight adjustments had to be made to the second stage, which is the transition section from tower to spire.  This delayed operations, which were then completed on Thursday when the spire itself went on relatively easily.  Finally the cross was fitted on top of the spire and secured thought the centre of the structure.  The spire stands about 4.1 metres has been absent for about 40 years.  The original spire was sheet iron on timber and is believed to have been in place for about 60 years.

[Actually St Joseph’s seems to have had a spire from its construction in 1874; at least the earliest photographs from the late 1870s show it with one, though whether this spire was the same one throughout is unknown.]  Father Quin is glad to see the architectural integrity of the building restored and says the parishioners have been quite excited and pleased with its return.  It also looks particularly good when floodlit at night.  He praised the work of Adrian Smith and team at Ashmore engineering and thanked Paul Wilson and his crew for removing the existing material from the tower.

Father Laurie Quinn is pictured in front of the church with Elaine Keogh and Angie Webster.
