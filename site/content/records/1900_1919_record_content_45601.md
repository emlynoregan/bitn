Swore to seeing his daughter-in-law commit acts of gross impropriety with Grow and of seeing them in the same room three or four times.  [He also said he still owned the cabs etc.]

The SM concluded that much of the defendant’s jealousy and bad behaviour resulted from his recent illness and neurasthenia.  The bench believed he had assaulted his wife as described and then had her locked up on a false charge.  Cruelty and failure to provide maintenance was proved.  A separation should be granted and custody of the children, also defendant to pay 30/- a week to the State Children’s Council in Adelaide.  Professional costs of £4-4-0 were awarded against the defendant.
