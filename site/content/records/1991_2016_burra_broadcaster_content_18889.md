Goyder House Boarding Facility AGM.  Report by Chairman Dick Secomb.

There was a new house parent, Maxine Lucas, for the start of the second semester 1998.  The facility joined the SA Rural Students’ Accommodation Program at the start of 1999.  This allowed them to keep the doors open because of the financial assistance gained.  A security system was installed in the downstairs part of the building.  John Phillips continues as a tutor this year, one night a week.
