The Pet Show & Picnic at the Burra North Playground, in aid of Burra North FFCF ‘Pin Up Girl’, Lotus Twist, was a great success and it is believed the day will clear well over £50.  The event is reported at length, with winners of fancy dress, sporting and other contests listed.

[The Burra Record 66, 18, 8 May 1945, page 2 gives the final total as £71-9-0.]
