Burra Show Society.  A.B. Riggs was re-elected President at the adjourned AGM on Friday.  The books showed the Society concluded the year with a deficit of £576-6-3, but this was due to a charge of £632 for depreciation, which had not previously been shown on the books of the Society.  Without that there was a surplus for the year of £56.  J.M. Jacka is Vice-President
