History of the Burra Burra Mine by James Thomas Snr, No. 5.

The Strike of Miners & Labourers in 1847.

They wanted higher wages, were refused, and struck.  A few continued working and were then rounded up by the strikers, wheeled about in barrows and branded as blacklegs.  But they lacked unity or organisation and slowly drifted back to work and the only outcome was a handful of ringleaders got the sack.

The gold rush to California saw a few depart.  In Burra nothing in the way of schools had been attempted except for an old lady or two with an infant school in a private room.  From the age of 8 or 9 boys were employed horse driving or picking over the ore.

Black Thursday.

The Blacks had set fire to the grass in many places to secure new shoots for emus and kangaroos, when the wind from the north blew a hurricane and this added to a normal ‘brickfielder’.  The air was full of ash, grit and dust.  The temperature I should judge was about 140°F [At 60°C probably an exaggeration!] with a wind at 90-100 m.p.h. blowing gravel as large as peas as well as dust and sand.  It was hard to breathe.  I was 13.  The day was dark and candles had to be lit indoors and even then a tallow candle only appeared as a blue speck on the table.  The fires had depleted the oxygen and increased the carbonic acid gas in the atmosphere.  Many thought it the end of the world; others sought refuge in the hotels and drink.  The creek was even then silting up and observant people saw the dangers of flooding and the wise were building houses.  A flood followed Black Thursday.
