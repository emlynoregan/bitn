Burra School

The Public Works Standing Committee has accepted the need for improved school accommodation at Burra and construction has been recommended.  The loans allocation will be decided in August and construction will depend on this decision.  The decision to redevelop the existing site is based on the fact that it is a pleasant setting for attractive landscaping.  It is also near the town centre and will preserve the close relationships of the school with the community and give ready access to the Burra Town Swimming Pool and football oval.  The school will be able to offer facilities for the community in terms of the library and art and craft and music facilities and a multi-purpose sports hall.  It is envisaged that the school will become a focal point for educational, recreational and cultural interests.  There will be a staff block, administration, canteen, sports, music & drama areas and changing rooms as well as a library, recreation areas and car park.  Parents will have a continuity of involvement as their children move through the school from primary to secondary years.  There is the possibility of a unified administration under a single headmaster.
