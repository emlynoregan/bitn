Cr Bevan moved the motion be put and Cr Marston seconded.

When the motion was put Cr Baulderstone refused to vote on it.  Cr Woollacott said Cr Baulderstone had to vote according to the Act.

Cr Baulderstone moved an amendment that the matter be adjourned until it was clear what powers the Council had over its own property as opposed to the parklands.  This was not seconded and lapsed.

Cr Baulderstone again refused to vote and the notice of motion was lost with Crs S.J. & T.H. Woollacott voting in favour and Crs Lee, Marston and Bevan against.
