Burra Hospital Board, 25 July

Mr Hawkes was re-elected Chairman for the year.

The erection of the Isolation Ward is well advanced.

Mr Hawkes then made reference to Mr Melrose’s gift of £10,000 to the Waite Institute for Scientific Research.  Mr Melrose objected to its being raised as being of no relevance to the Board.  As to his generosity – he wanted to see the results of any donations he made and if anyone expected him to leave thousands in his will ‘they would draw a blank’.

The legal views on Mr Woollacott’s appointment were that it posed no legal problems and there would seem to be no ethical problem either, as the contract price [for the Isolation Block] had been fixed before his appointment.

Pigeons are still a problem at the Maternity Wing, though many had been destroyed.  The Chairman said rumours that the Isolation Ward was to cost £2,000 rather than £1,452 were untrue and the Board had the money for the building.

He also reported that the Porter’s room had been gutted by fire.  The investigation of the cause revealed the only likely thing was the explosion of an incubator lamp.  The machine had been working for 10 days and was all right when inspected at 6.45 p.m.  The building was insured for £200 and the contents for £70.  Damage had been assessed by the Insurance Society’s inspector at £110 for the building and £65-8-0 for contents.

Income from patients’ fees was well up and the Board was c. £600 better off than at the start of the year.
