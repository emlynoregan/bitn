Fire.  Mr J.G. Mann lost a large haystack near Hanson to fire on Sunday morning.  The stack of c. 90 tons of hay was insured for Â£125.  Mr Mann had a clearing sale on his land last Thursday and declined 31/- a ton for the hay.  It was arranged it could stand on the property for 12 months if necessary.
