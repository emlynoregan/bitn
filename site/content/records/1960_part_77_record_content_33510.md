The RSL AGM was held last Friday night in the club rooms with the best attendance of members since 1961.  Mr Wilf Nankivell was re-elected President with Messrs B.A. Riggs and T.R. Rogers as Vice-Presidents.  Ben Kotz continues as Secretary with Mr Arthur Wright as Treasurer.  Mr Bert Cornelius reported that 1966 did not get away to a good start and when he could not continue in May due to ill health it looked as if the club might close.  In June one of the oldest members in Mr Wilf Nankivell consented to take over as President.  The work of the Womenâ€™s Auxiliary was much appreciated and through their efforts the club had been able to maintain its Legacy commitments.  Mr Nankivell thanked the headmasters of the schools for allowing students to attend the Armistice Day Service.  He hoped members would take a more active role in 1967.
