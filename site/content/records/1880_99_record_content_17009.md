Letter from ‘Verbum sap’ advising the editor: -

‘If Mr Ridgway implies that in the past the affairs of the Town Council have been grossly mismanaged, what is that to you?  Let the ex-mayors and ex-councillors fight their own battles, and mind your own business.’

Taking up other people’s battles will only ‘make enemies and lose business.’
