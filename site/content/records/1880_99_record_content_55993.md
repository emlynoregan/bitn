Burra Town Council, 5 February.

Cr Harris said he would not have moved the last meeting be in committee if he had known the reporter had only come to give a fair and impartial report.

The editor interpolates that such was always the intent, though he has been charged with reporting too extensively.

The Mayor reported on the inspection of the town and that he had received a requisition for Mr Holder to address the public on the ‘Work of the Past Session’.  Mr Holder had agreed to do so.

A committee was appointed to look into a new by-law for hawkers.

Cr Harris moved that Mr Snell not be compensated for the wrong he believed was done to him and after some debate it was so resolved.

Cr West thought Snell should receive some recompense even if the Councillors concerned dipped into their own pockets.
