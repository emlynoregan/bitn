Koomooloo Life

Michelle Osborn writes an article on the life of Henry & Jacqui Dunn at Koomooloo, 75 km east of Burra, with three young children: Jock (4), Posie (3) and Hugo (13 months).  [Two photos.]

The family moved there three years ago.  They get into Burra once a week or once a fortnight.  Jock and Posie make use of Kindy of the Air (via computer), which is accessed through RICE (Remote Isolated Childrenâ€™s Exercise) Pt Augusta and they attend Burra Pre-School Kindergarten when possible.

The recent employment of governess Ashlea Kuzmich from Redcliffe Station has made life easier.  Outback childcare also provides a childcare worker to come to stay for a minimum of two weeks at a time, which is particularly handy at busy times like crutching and shearing.  There is also a toy Library service.  There are neighbours with young children.  Both Jacqui and Henry sat Koomooloo is a wonderful environment for children.   The problems of medical care, however, were made apparent when Posie last Tuesday fell off the back of a ute and needed urgent medical attention.  The Burra ambulance arrived half an hour before the helicopter rescue team.  Posie was flown to Adelaide and has fully recovered from the concussion she sustained.  Henry was amazed at the quick response of the Burra ambulance.
