‘Erratic Correspondent’ writes his usual outspoken and left wing perspective on:

The Upper House elections, Principle v. Capital

The poetry book Christ in London by Tristram St Martin, which compared the simplicity of Christ and the life of the Archbishop of Canterbury.

The socialist regime of Topolobampo in Sinala, Mexico,

Dr Barnado

A Victorian libel case: PMG v. Sunday Times.
