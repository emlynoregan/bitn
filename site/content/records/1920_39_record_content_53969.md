Mongolata Goldfield

Takati GM Co. (Pexton’s) reports crushing 57½ tons for 3oz 2dwt 10gr per ton with tailings bringing in 15dwt 14gr per ton.  This is considered a splendid return from ore that was not a picked lot.

A small lot of ore from the north end of the field went through the battery recently at 3½oz per ton.

The mines are closing for the Christmas break for a couple of weeks.
