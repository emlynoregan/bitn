Susan Roche writes re the old Post & Telegraph Office.

The old Post & Telegraph Office is to be placed on the market at the same time as Burra’s 150th anniversary.  This is an opportunity for Burra people to gain access to a building for the first time in 30 years and to have a say in its future use.  Burra has a rich history and the town needs a large building for the permanent display of paintings depicting its early days.  The town already owns four valuable S.T. Gill watercolours, which are stored in the State Art Gallery because there is no suitable building to house them in Burra.  Apart from a permanent display of art history there is enough space in the building for travelling SA Country Art Trust Exhibitions and for local artists’ exhibitions.  The people of Burra are entitled to view their history displayed and their children given the opportunity to learn how their forefathers lived and what they achieved.  Please support the Friends of the old Telegraph & Post Office in their endeavours.
