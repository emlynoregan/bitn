Hanson Soldiers’ Memorial Institute officially opened on 10 April

The idea was first mooted for a hall at a meeting on 7 October 1922, but the small attendance meant there was no definite decision.  The gathering had concluded that the Methodist Church, school and Council Chamber were all too small for public functions.  We believe M.J. Marchant was elected President and Tom McNamara was the first Secretary.  Mr Marchant is still the Chairman.  Mr McNamara resigned on leaving the district a few years later.  The wood and iron hall has been erected in the park lands facing east and is the only building on the right hand side of the ‘Main St’ and is surrounded by a spacious park with several pine trees.  The park and trees are a memorial to those who enlisted from the town and district in the Great War.  The building has a hip roof and the floor measures 30ft x 40ft.  There are two large escape doors on the north and east sides and two large windows on either side.  The jarrah floor should prove ideal for dancing.  There is a piano and the place is electrically lit with wind-driven power.  The ceremony was performed by Hon. Walter Duncan MLC at 3 p.m.  Also present were C.A.S. Hawker MHR, Hon. G.F. Jenkins and Mr A.D. McDonald & A. Melrose Members for the District.  Cr Harold C. Atkins attended as Chairman of Hanson DC and Mr H.J.B. Jennison represented the Burra RSL.

[A list of others present is printed.]

Mr Marchant summarised the event leading up to the day.  Having started 12 years earlier the effort faded for lack of funds and virtually went out of existence for six years.  Then under Mr Boehme and Secretary Mr H. Schumacher interest was reborn and about £160 was raised.  Then again the effort seemed to flag until the present Secretary Mr Pattullo came along and things began to move again and the sum in hand reached £200.  This time they went ahead and constructed the building.

Hon. Duncan said he believed there had been talk of a hall for about 50 years, but finally it was the returned soldiers that saw the completion of the scheme.  The town would now have a suitable building for social gatherings and would doubtless attract politicians to air their views too.

There are finishing touches to be added inside.
