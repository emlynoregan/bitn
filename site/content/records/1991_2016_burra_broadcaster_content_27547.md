Thamm’s White Hart Garage has been in the family since 1914 when Ron Thamm’s father* started a wheelwright’s business on the premises.  Ron did his apprenticeship with Barney Rogers at Burra North Motors on Morehead Street before returning to the smithy and wheelwright activities with father, Cecil.  Travis Thamm has done his apprenticeship with A.W. Vater & Co. of Saddleworth and now with a couple of years’ experience has returned to Burra to join his father David in the family business as the 5th generation of the family at the garage.  [It was Ron Thamm’s grandfather Emil Thamm who started the business in 1914.  He is also needed to make five generations.  See:
