Burra Show Society

H.J. Finnis, Secretary of the Royal Show, Adelaide, visited Burra earlier in the year to give his opinion on the suitability or otherwise of the present Burra Showground and the Burra sports Syndicate Grounds for holding the local show.  His report to the local sub-committee on this matter stated:

The present site is not ideal.  The natural contours and stony ground present difficulties.  The arena is of an awkward shape.  The rising ground in the northeast corner is unsafe for parking cars.

The present site could be improved by re-designing the arena to a length of 420 ft by 250 ft, with the longer axis running north-south and positioning the western boundary about a chain from the present western boundary.  This would allow two jumps on either side (replacing the present three jumps).  One of the present jumps running north-south must be difficult, if not dangerous, in strong afternoon sunlight.

More research would be needed to find a local source for stops in concentric rings for cars parked on the northeast slope.  Investigation of the possible use of a road plough or similar implement to provide a series of ridges/terraces for safer parking is also needed.

If undertaken these changes would provide a larger area for parking cars on the level space to the east.  The provision of stops would turn the northeast corner into a natural grandstand. The new arena would provide more satisfactory jumping facilities.

The Syndicate Ground could be used for a show, but certain additional equipment would be needed.  An arena would need to be fenced, but this posed no great difficulty.  All buildings needed should be able to be accommodated on the Golf Course, provided adequate attention was given to the disposal of floodwaters.  The control of entry to the extensive site was not insoluble.

Mr H.E. Rowel inspected the Syndicate ground from the point of view of the Race Club and could see no objection, provided no buildings were placed in the centre of the course.

Mr M.T. Fuller, speaking for the Sports Association, who are the Trustees of the ground, offered all assistance if the transfer were to be made.
