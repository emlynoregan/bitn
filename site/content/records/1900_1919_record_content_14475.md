William Southon had an amazing ride through town on Wednesday.  Having had rather more wine than was wise he got into his spring dray at the Burra Hotel with some difficulty.  Standing up in his cart he whipped up the horse which took off for Redruth.  At about the post office the reins got tangled and amazingly the horses managed a U-turn and dashed back into Market Square with Southon still standing in the cart – whip in one hand and hat in the other while singing Break the News Gently to Mother.  He got to the reins in time to amaze all the onlookers by negotiating Parks’s corner and careered up Chapel St where he stopped to sell a broom – many of which he had for sale.  Here M-C Grosser overtook him and placed him for a time in ‘his little cot’.
