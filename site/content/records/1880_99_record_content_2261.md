Burra Town Council.  22 November

Council resolved to go ahead with a poll on the closing of hotels on Sunday, at the time of the Council elections on 1 December.

Cr Richardson [licensee of the Burra Hotel] thought ‘it would be far better for the public if the public houses were open the whole day.’

Cr Ridgway called for the Council to print posters and insert advertisements to get the message out.  Carried.
