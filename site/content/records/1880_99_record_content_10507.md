J.F. Duff & J. Lewis arranged a trotting match in the past week.  Mr Duff conceded an eight-mile start to Mr Lewis’s pair and a handicap of 3cwt in the trap.  Mr Lewis accomplished his distance, Sod Hut to Kapunda, in 3 hrs 45 mins, starting at 6.00 a.m.

Mr Duff’s pair refused to trot till Marrabel and so he was completely out of contention and he reached Kapunda at 11.15 a.m., having made a 15 minute stop at Waterloo and another at Marrabel, as well as 30 minutes at Hamilton.  He covered the 48 miles in 4 hrs, not including stops.
