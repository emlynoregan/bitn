Kooringa News, 13 November

On Sunday last Rev. J.D. Whittaker preached his last sermon at the Kooringa Primitive Methodist Chapel.  He is about to leave for New Zealand.  Tea and public meetings were held the following day to farewell him at which Messrs Way & Davidson delivered fine valedictory addresses.  Mr Whittaker replied at some length with an emotional address, at the end of which many were sobbing and weeping and all were profoundly moved by the touching scene.  Captain Roach handed to Mr Whittaker a purse of 60 sovereigns as a testimonial of their general esteem.  (Mr J. Roach provided the tea gratuitously.)

Last Sunday the Wesleyans opened their new chapel at Westbury, a rising township adjoining Copperhouse.  Rev. Lloyd of Kooringa preached morning and evening.  W.H. Wilkinson Sen. preached in the afternoon.  There was a good congregation at each service, though inclement weather doubtless kept some away.  There were tea and public meetings the following day.

The harvest has now commenced in earnest and large quantities are passing through the town.  Wool carting has not yet finished, with several loads here at present in transit for Kapunda and Adelaide.  Business remains slow.
