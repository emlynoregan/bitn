Burra Town Council, 19 April

Three boys aged 10-12 were brought before the Council and admonished by it for vandalism in chopping down trees and destroying latticework at the Kooringa Playground.  They were warned that serious consequences would follow any repetition.

A letter of appreciation was received from the Governor, writing on behalf of HM King Edward VIII in response to the Council’s expression of sympathy on the death of HM King George V.

[E.J. Davey as Inspector reported at some length on the vandalism at the Kooringa Playground.  He also reported in detail on a problem with hawkers in the town and in particular with one fruit hawker.  In this particular case the problem was complicated by the fact that the hawker had paid his fee only to find horse drawn and other vehicle occupying his designated place.  He set up business elsewhere and then refused to move when confronted. Mr Davey felt the Council needed to act firmly against infringements by hawkers.]

Aberdeen Tennis club sent A.B. Riggs and M. Morton, the President and Secretary respectively, to talk with Council about the latter’s possible repairs to their tennis courts.  They said the club’s reduced membership at present only warranted the use of two courts and if numbers increased they understood the club would be able to keep the courts in order.  If the Council saw fit to repair the two courts in question it might be acceptable if the Council gave them 10 years to pay off the costs.  Whatever the Council decided would be taken back to a meeting of members.

Cr Jennison said the matter had started off as an alternative to the expense of laying out entirely new courts for the young folk of Kooringa.  He thought the idea of the Aberdeen Club paying the work off in yearly instalments was a good one.

Cr Kellaway said the idea had come from Cr Riggs’s desire to provide for the young folk of Kooringa.  Personally, he thought there were enough courts in the town and he assured the deputation that there was no thought of taking the courts away from the club – only of putting them in order.  If this could be done for £60 to £70 and the Club paid £15 annually it was good interest and the ratepayers could not complain.

Cr Jeffery thought, from a ratepayers’ point of view several courts would soon be available at the racecourse, suggesting there would be no lack of them in the future.  If the repairs were made hi believed the club should guarantee the amount to be paid annually to the Council.

Cr Dow did not think the new courts meant that the Kooringa Club intended giving up the present courts.  The extras would use up some of the surplus young people.  He supported Cr Jeffrey’s comments.
