The Late Tom Scovell featured in a story that came to light from Saddleworth this week.  On one occasion he was in the bar of his hotel at Saddleworth when it was mentioned that there was a child in the town with typhoid fever and although there was a nurse in attendance, the child should really be in the Auburn Hospital.  But no one would volunteer to drive the child there.  Mr Scovell promptly loaded the nurse and child into his car, sank a couple of his best whiskeys, and conveyed them both to Auburn.  The sequel was that the nurse (Mrs Wright) caught the complaint and died, while the child survived.  Tom later maintained that no fever could survive against the best brandy he had in stock.
