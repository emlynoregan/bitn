Garry Disher, formerly of Booborowie and educated there and at Burra High School and then the University of Adelaide has a paperback edition of his second book of short stories for sale at his own gallery in Burra*.  He has lived in Melbourne since 1974 except for a Fellowship in Creative Writing at Stanford University in California 1978-79.

[* This was somehow garbled in editing and was corrected in the issue of 3 February 1983 to say that Garry Disher did not have a gallery in Burra.]
