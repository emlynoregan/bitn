About nine years ago her left arm was amputated on account of cancer.  Sir Samuel Way had just gone through a similar operation at the age of 79 years when he visited Burra in 1914 and he went to see the old lady who he was informed had prayed for him.  He later sent a letter and a shawl.  She was a devoted member of St Joseph’s Church.
