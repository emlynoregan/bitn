J.G. Innes Ker, Inspector of Stock v. Ford, for cutting off with a straight cut part of the ears of certain sheep.  Adjourned from the previous week.

The case is reported at length - the theft of sheep being of considerable interest.

Ford contended that the action complained of was done before the Act under which the charge was brought, had come into force, about three years ago.

John C. Sandland gave expert evidence that the slicing had been done, some within six months, and the rest within twelve.

G.A. Gebhardt gave evidence contending that the sheep were his.  Mr Ford’s land adjoined his.

Ford was fined 40/- per sheep plus costs.  [The number of sheep doesn’t seem to be mentioned.]  Mr Akhurst, for Ford, said he would appeal.
