Entertainment and Revue Club.  Following the success of the recent Burra Revue, a meeting was held at St Mary’s Hall last Friday and it was decided to form an Entertainment Club.  It was decided to organise entertainments such as revues to raise funds for town benefits, such as the Institute.  A stage entertainment is planned for July.  L.H. Thomas has been appointed Patron, with R.A. Bevan as Secretary/Treasurer, with a committee of eight.
