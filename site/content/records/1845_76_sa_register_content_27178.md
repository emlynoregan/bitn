11 February 1876, page 5

Visit to the scene of the recent railway accident at Peak’s Crossing by our special reporter.

Burra 10 February

I visited the scene this morning by means of the special train provided by Mr Mais, and met the coroner and jury there; they having gone to view the wreck.  The country from Farrell’s Flat on showed evidence of heavy rainfall.  The propensity of the area to flood was noted when the railway was constructed and 13 additional culverts were added between Farrell’s Flat and Burra.  The effects of the hailstorm were apparent in the area.  Straw and hail were mixed and piled up in heaps; some of which were still a couple of feet high.  Around the scene of the accident the heaps were larger still and the hailstones as big as cherries.  The water lying about was one to two feet deep.  The first breach on the Adelaide side was a small one and then came the culvert.  The earth all round has been loosened and in places the abutments are quite bared.  Except where the accident occurred the rails are still hanging and the rails and sleepers formed a tolerably firm suspension bridge over which we walked.  Fifty feet further on was the smash.  The engine lay as it had fallen, with its nose embedded in the opposite bank.  The tender has been pulled up on end and the trucks which ran on top of it have both been thrown aside.  Almost everything has been completely smashed.  Perhaps the body of the engine may be used again and parts of the tender, but all the trucks, but one are useless.  Wheat had been scattered over the ground to a depth of two or three feet.  Sixty or seventy men are still at work in removing the wreckage.

I have since learnt that Gitsham saved the four end trucks from going over by working the brake in his van.  The train was going down an incline at slow speed when the accident occurred.
