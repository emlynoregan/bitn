Goyder’s Line.  Research by CSIRO & SARDI says that modelling suggests that with global climatic change, by 2030 Goyder’s Line could move 20 km south and by 2070 some 50 km south.  While the warming trend can be projected with some confidence, the effect on rainfall is far less certain and technological developments may make the effects of climate change less damaging.
