Burra Cheer-up Soc.

The Ladies’ band etc. greeted Cpl W. Stevenson & Driver T. Brown (4th of the Brown brothers to return) on 9 June.

A Welcome Home was held at the Booborowie Woolshed on 11 June for J. Hogan, E. Dollard, J. Kelly, Percy Hooper, Bert Harvey, John Aldridge, A.V. Wilkinson, C. Beaven, George Jeffery & M. Dowd.  Apologies from M. Hogan, E. Harvey & B. Dowd.

The gathering was the largest for a long time at Booborowie.

Soldiers’ Aid Soc. calls for a good attendance next meeting to decide whether they will cater for the Burra Show this year.

‘Constant’ writes drawing attention to the absence of the President, Secretary and most of the Committee of the Leighton Hall at the recent welcome home social for six soldiers.

‘Esperanto’ writes pouring scorn on the idea of a monument in Market Square and rather vaguely talking of ‘a living monument to Internationalism’ and complaining too of the attitude of the press.  [The last point puzzled the Editor and certainly a free flow of letters seems to have been published as well as lengthy reports on all meetings.]
