Kooringa News, 29 January

This week the town was visited by Burtonâ€™s troupe of equestrians and gymnasts.  When they arrived on Monday morning after placards had circulated announcing their coming, the appearance of the dragon car (containing the band) caused a sensation.  Many were enthusiastically awaiting their arrival as a break in the monotony of everyday life, but some of the tradesmen must have viewed the dragon as a monster that would consume the loose cash that might else have flown their way.  The entertainment was generously patronised on Monday and Tuesday.

One of the two poor men found dead in the north has been identified as a poor half-witted fellow named Henry Dart.  He seems to have been wandering about without any fixed purpose or means of subsistence.  Trooper Ayliffe, who went up to investigate, satisfied himself that the man died from sunstroke and afterwards buried the corpse near where it was found.
