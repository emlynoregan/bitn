Burra Bowling Club AGM

The report by retiring President Brian Riggs.

Two members died during the year: Lance Phillips and Hedley Pearce.  Financially the year was a success, due in considerable measure to the bar manager Neil Hurst.  The new watering system is now working well after a few initial hitches.  Membership numbers leave a little to be desired.  Facilities are being constantly improved.  Keith Phillips was the Club Champion and also won the Mid North Champion of Champions at Auburn.  The open tournaments in January and at Easter were a great success despite mediocre weather.

The Associates are an essential part of the club and their catering has been especially capably handled.  The greens were reasonably good throughout and were good for Easter and the inter-divisional championships of the women’s Bowling Clubs.  The purchase of a new mower will make the job of the Greens’ Manager Edgar Pietsch easier.  Andrew Phillips had done good work preparing them for play and Wally Fridd is thanked for attending to the watering.
