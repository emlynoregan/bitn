Obituary.  Eric Murray of ‘Petherton’ Mt Bryan died at Walkerville last Thursday aged 59.  He was well known in the district where he had resided for over 30 years.  He was a son of the late Mr & Mrs Alex Murray of Mt Crawford and was educated at St Peter’s College, Adelaide.  Like his brothers, he was a splendid horseman and member of the famous Mt Crawford Polo Team, which comprised himself, Cyril & Elliott Murray and R.F. Angas.  It had a nation-wide reputation and was never beaten off the stick, playing all-comers from around Australia.  He enlisted soon after the outbreak of WWI in the 1st Regiment of King Edward’s Own horse and saw much service.  During the war he was married in New York to Miss Jean Knox of Melbourne and in crossing the Atlantic the ship he was on was torpedoed by a German U-boat.  In 1920 he came to reside at ‘Petherton’ Mt Bryan and the Mt Crawford Sheep Stud was transferred there.  The late Messrs Eric & Cyril Murray carried on the stud together until 1947, when the partnership was dissolved.  Mr Murray involved himself with many of the district’s sporting activities.  He was ably supported by his wife and three daughters: Mary Mrs F. Hamblyn (Treweek, Queensland), Sheila Mrs C.M. Manning (McKay [sic] Queensland) and Anne Mrs John Knox (Melbourne.)  In WWII he was OC the Burra VDC.     His funeral at Hallett on Saturday was very largely attended.  [Eric Moray Murray born 13 May 1894 North Adelaide: died 23 July 1953, Walkerville, residence Mt Bryan.]
