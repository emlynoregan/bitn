Burra Town Council recently approved a plan for the beautification of the creek area near the swimming pool.  A committee of Messrs Baulderstone, W. Lloyd, Cummins and Fullgrabe were elected to investigate and report to Council.

The plan was accepted and work will begin in the winter months.  The plan covers both sides of the creek from the new footbridge to the Jubilee Fountain.  [A very rough plan of the area is printed.]

Between the bridge and the dressing sheds the area is to be planted with lawn and shrubs – to be sustained with waste water from the pool.  Next to the toddlers’ pool will be an area 100 feet wide to be a children’s playground enclosed by a cyclone fence.  Between the playground and the present caravan park sheds the area will be developed as a car park.

On the eastern side of the pool and playground a strip will be planted with lawns and shrubs beneath the large gums with barbecues to be built.

Near the old fountain a natural vehicle entrance presents itself, giving access to the car park, pool and barbecue area.

Only two or three old and dangerous pines would have to be removed and some other trimming would be required.  A new block of conveniences is to be erected near the present caravan park entrance.  The old type of conveniences presently in use would be removed.  The whole area from the car park to the fountain would be ideal for a caravan park.  The eastern bank of the creek is to be planted with trees and shrubs; perhaps on school arbor days.
