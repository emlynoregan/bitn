Redruth Methodist Sunday-school.

The stone laying was performed on Saturday last by the Rev. E.M. Ingamells.  A storm threatened, but held off for the open-air service.  The site was gaily decorated with bunting and a gallery erected for the scholars and officers.  Tot Bentley presided at the piano.  The history of the church was well represented by the presence of Mr Richard Reed Sen. and Mesdames James Tiver & Chant, each of whom are close to their 90th birthday.  The Sunday-school superintendent, Mr E.W. Dunhill presided.  Mr James Reed presented the trowel to Rev. Ingamells.  Coins and copies of local and Adelaide papers were placed under the stone.

There followed a brief history of Methodism in Redruth.

The 1st chapel was built in 1855 and Mr Richard Reed, present today had helped to mix the mortar for the plaster and had donated £100 for the present project.

In 1856 Ben Preece started the first Sunday-school in a stable at the rear of what is now Mr Austin’s shop - it was lined with bags and whitewashed.  Miss E. Preece, his daughter, was present today.

The present church was built in 1874 and the foundation stone was laid exactly 50 years ago today.

Seven years ago the church had £60 in hand for a Sunday-school, and then just before Rev. Ingamells was appointed to the circuit in 1920, Mr James Reed promised £1 for every £1 raised, up to £1,000.  Mr Reed also offered £350 towards buying the land next to the church if they could get it. Mr Thomas let them have the property, with four roads around the block, for £600.  At present they had £2,500 in hand and hoped to open the school with either no debt or a very small one.

A tea-meeting followed in Jubilee Hall at which £14 was taken at the tables.  The day in all raised about £80.  Special donations: -
