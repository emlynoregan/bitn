Burra Show on 25 October was a success.  The weather was fine and rather cool and the special ‘Barwell’ [railcar] from Adelaide was well patronised.  Sideshows were well represented this year.

Art and photography was poorly represented with no photographs at all.

Poultry and birds attracted a very large entry with 294 turkeys, geese and fowls and 265 pigeons.

Cattle have improved in recent years and Jerseys were much admired.

Cookery was one of the best displays in the pavilion.

Flowers were better than expected after the recent hot winds.  Roses were very good, but the usual sweet pea show was much affected.  Fruit as usual was limited and the dry season affected grain and fodder adversely.

Draught stock entries were up, but blood stock was limited.

Horses in action were good, especially in hack and hunting classes.

Implements were entered for display, but not competition.

Needlework was well represented.

Dairy produce was poor following the withdrawal of Mrs Eddie Finch after 1932, but fresh meat was excellent, especially from Messrs Jeffery & Byrne.

Pigs were barely represented with but four entries.

Sheep entries were of good quality, but numbers were disappointing.

Schoolwork was also down on previous years.

Vegetables were good and fleece wool was of excellent quality.

[Personal interest: R. Fuss was Flower Steward and offered a trophy for champion pansy, but apparently did not have entries, or at least did not win a prize.]
