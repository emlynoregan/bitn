Tiffany Chapman, Project Manager for the Burra Cultural Centre (the Town Hall) writes to thank all who made the National Trust SA Heritage and The Outback Conference such a great success on the 8-10 November.  Organisers and attendees gave the event rave reviews.  They were especially appreciative of the different locations available, the way the catering facilities were shared among a variety of groups and the general warmth of the locals.
