Burra Town council, 18 March.

The Mayor reported that the Commissioner of Public Works has advised that the Waterworks will be handed over from 1 Jan. 1889 without reference to arrears, but so far the lease has not come to hand.

The Recreation Ground work has been completed, but for the removal of the rubbish.

Tar-paving is to be laid from the Post Office to the National Bank, From Mr Symon’s shop to Drew & Co. and opposite Mr Lasscock’s shop.  The cost will be 1/- per yard of frontage of which half will be recovered from the property owners.

[Note that this refers to the footpath, not the road.]

Cr Rabbich said the Fountain Committee was willing to hand it over to the council without reference to the debt on it if Council will erect it.

Council will accept and erect it at a cost of not more than £5.

Council is to consider a new By-law to require hawkers to be licensed.
