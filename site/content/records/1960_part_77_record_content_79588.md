Thefts.  Early on Sunday morning goods and cash to a value of $5,600 from four premises. [Though the paper actually has $56000 with an awkward line split after the 5.]

Jennison’s Tyre Service – six colour television sets

Garage Workshops opposite – entered apparently in a search for a utility to use as transport

T.W. Wilkinson & Co. – Chemist – entered and sun glasses and petty cash taken.

Burra Hotel – a quantity of cash was taken and a getaway vehicle was taken from J.J. & B.C. Richards’ Garage.
