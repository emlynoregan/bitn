Mrs G. Webster is a war widow of WWI and has long struggled with considerable difficulties to establish her farm and educate her children.  After her great losses in the recent fire, the RSL feels it is up to the people of the district to with gifts of hat, grain or some money to help her adjust to those losses.  The RSL has started the donations list with Â£15 and Roy Lloyd has given 30 bags of wheat.
