Booborowie RSL has taken possession of its new clubroom purchased from Mr G.H. Pryde and the first meeting was held on Saturday.  The building is of asbestos with a dividing partition.  The larger part was previously used as a garage and it has been decided to lay a floor in it to make it suitable for entertaining.
