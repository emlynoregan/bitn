First Burra Show. Ed. comment was that it had a few problems, but generally went very well, especially considering that the organisation was only about 6-7 weeks old. The purchase of some land for the future shows is seen as a priority. Three sites are suggested. Cemetery Flat, between the school and Paxton Square, and between Redruth and Hampton
