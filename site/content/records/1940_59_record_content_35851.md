Mr L. Hawke, President of the War Memorial Committee explained the scheme.  His committee comprised 20 men from all walks of life.  The expenditure might seem a lot, but £800 of it would be contributed by the Governments and the Council had £400 in hand and in the end the town would have an asset valued at £3,000.  The committee would complete the work on the oval for £2,000 and another £1,000 would be needed for the tennis courts.  They had £200 in hand, which with the £1,200 would leave only £600 to be raised by public subscription.  [Though this would not cover the tennis court costs.]  The alternative he said was either to raise a larger sum by public subscription or to abandon the project and leave the town with antiquated sporting facilities.

T.H. Woollacott spoke against the scheme.  He was not opposed to a war memorial, but did not want the town to be saddled with a debt.  It was already the highest rated town in SA.  He criticised the pulling down of trees at the oval and wondered where was the swimming pool the town was going to have, or the modern Hospital and the Scout Hall built by the late Mr James Reed was going to ruin.  Any contractor who thought he could estimate costs in the prevailing uncertain economic climate was a fool.  Prices were fluctuating too rapidly.  He urged those present not to be carried away by Mr Hawke’s scheme.

C. Radford, W. Marsh, A.B. Riggs and R.H. Smith all challenged Cr T.H. Woollacott’s views.

M.T. Fuller asked if the amount in hand proved to be insufficient, would the committee be prepared to cut back on their elaborate scheme.  The Mayor said nothing could be done without Council’s permission.

Mr Hawke repeated the calculations showing how they would get £2,000, which would be ample to make a good oval and if a further £1,000 were to be raised then the tennis courts would be built.  He elaborated a little on the cost of the loan, but said in answer to Cr Woollacott that far from being a problem, the money was virtually repaid before it was borrowed.  Cr Woollacott he said, refused to understand the situation because he did not want to.

The motion to borrow the £1,200 was put and carried.

A subsequent meeting of the War Memorial Committee decided to open a subscription list through the Burra Record and to organise a Junk Sale for 30 April.
