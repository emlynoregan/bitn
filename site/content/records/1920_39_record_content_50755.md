Obituary.  Mr William Martin Tohl was the son of the late G.J. Tohl and was born at Black Springs 6 January 1867 and lived there for a few years and then at Farrell’s Flat before in 1888 taking up land at Booborowie with his brother T.G. Tohl.  Though he did not take an active part in public or sporting life, he was renowned for his generosity in giving liberally when help was needed for churches, hall, school or sports.  He was honourable and upright in his dealings and his word was his bond.  He was buried at Booborowie on Saturday when some 80 vehicles attended and school children of the district formed a guard of honour.

[Born 5 January 1867 Black Springs: died 3 May 1934, Kooringa residence Booborowie.]
