The Rotunda.  The grass planted in the enclosure is growing nicely.  The committee has settled on 1 February at 1.30 p.m. for the opening ceremony.  Sir Jenkin Coles MP will be invited to speak and ex-Mayor Mr S. Burns will open the memorial.  He was in office when moves to erect the memorial were started.
