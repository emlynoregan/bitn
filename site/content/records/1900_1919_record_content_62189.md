Local Board of Health

G.C. Kuchenmeister is granted a licence for a slaughterhouse [at the end of Ayers St].

The Board is in debt to the bank for £113.

‘Hanson’ writes again in reply to Thomas McNamara of the previous week.

He thinks the culprit of the original damage to quarter-mile of crop should be willing to pay for it.  He estimates 9 or 10 chains at about a bushel of wheat at a prevailing price of c. 4/-.  As for McNamara’s complaint that a returned soldier has been passing through his rented road and leaving it open: if McNamara had placed there a 12ft swung gate as required by the DC instead of two barbed wires to get through then he considers that the offender and his wife would be less inclined to leave the way open.
