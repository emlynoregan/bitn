Pygmy Bluetongue Lizard

Sir David Attenborough was in the Mid North last week, filming his documentary, Life in Cold Blood.

After a sighting at Marion in 1959 the lizard was believed extinct until a road-killed brown snake was found to have eaten one in 1992.  Three years later Barry Read found one on his 80 acre property neighbouring Princess Royal.  Since then a ‘Recovery Team’ has been working to ensure the population of the lizard was stabilised.  Sir David said he was thrilled to be involved in the Bluetongue cause.  Professor Mike Bull of Flinders University is also working with the ‘Recovery Team’.  The recovery process seems to be doing well, with the numbers of the lizard rising.  Barry Read has established a sanctuary where he first found the reptile in 1995.  Local landowner Chris Reed said he had changed his land management practice to minimise any impact on the Bluetongues, but it was no chore to do so.  Mr Reed said numbers in the Mid North are now thought to be c. 5,000.
