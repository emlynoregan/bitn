Redruth Court, 4 April

Frank Lang was charged with breaking into the Bon Accord Hotel and stealing the safe and money to £44-7-6 on 26 March.  Bernard Leo Symonds proprietor and John Charles Smith manager gave evidence of the circumstances on the night and of the missing safe, money and other items stolen.

W.H. McCormick plain clothes constable told of finding a car, an Elcar, in damaged condition on 27 March in George St Stepney.

Ronald Charles Simpson of ‘Drive Yourself Ltd’ of Light Square told how the accused hired a car on 26 March under the name Langdon.  He returned about 5.30 p.m. and exchanged it for the Elcar.

W.R. Lee, garage proprietor of Kooringa, gave evidence of having seen the car at 11.30 p.m. in Burra.  He noticed it because it was an unusual vehicle and had noticed the number, but had not made a note of it.

B.H. Moran, bank manager of Lyndoch gave evidence of seeing the car near Kersbrook on 27 March.  Its four wheels were in the air and three apparently drunken men were nearby.  One was trying to ride a bicycle.  He identified the defendant as one of the men and also identified the car.  He had taken a note of its number.  The defendant had denied to police that he had hired a car or been to Burra.  Subsequently he admitted hiring the car at about 1.30 p.m. and said he had returned it about 11.30 p.m.  He was committed for trial at the Criminal Sessions.
