New Road Laws

Motor cycles are required to have rear vision mirrors.

It is an offence to cross a railway line where signals are operating unless directed to do so by an employee of the Railways Commissioner.

The speed limit within 50 yards of a railway crossing is 20 m.p.h.

All omnibuses and vehicles carrying explosive materials or inflammable gases must stop before crossing a railway line.

The speed past a stationary school bus is 15 m.p.h.
