D. McDonald Steele writes reporting on the success of the Youth’s Occupational Campaign in Burra.  It was a partial success in that some classes were run in useful subjects, but he was disappointed in the low number of entrants both from boys and girls, as many more were eligible.  He was also disappointed at those who enrolled, but failed to attend.

Carpentry: 6 enrolled and it was well attended and good progress was made.

Motor Mechanics: 8 enrolled, but no one ever attended.

Shorthand & Typing: 6 enrolled and it was well attended with good progress.

Book-keeping: 6 enrolled and it was well attended with good progress.

The Sheep: 5 enrolled, but attendance was irregular and eventually fizzled out.

Wireless: 9 enrolled, but no one ever attended.

First Aid: six enrolled.  [Outcome not reported.]

He did not believe the fault lay with the teachers and he placed much of the blame on the parents.  A further attempt will be made to effect the enrolment of larger numbers.
