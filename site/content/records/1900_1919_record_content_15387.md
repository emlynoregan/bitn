The Ratepayers’ Meeting on Wednesday night drew only a small attendance.

Mr S. Burns as a candidate told ratepayers that when they elected someone to Council they should allow him to do the work in his own way.

Cr Neville has agreed to stand again with some reluctance.

Cr Launder felt Councillors could be satisfied with the work done.

Cr West missed his first ratepayers’ meeting for 13 years and Cr Snell was also absent.
