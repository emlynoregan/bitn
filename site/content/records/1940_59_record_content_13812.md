Ivan Wohling [sic: for Ivon] had a wallet as a present from his two sisters and carried it through the Middle East.  On returning to Australia he lost it, only to have it picked up by a Mrs Sykes on the steps of the Brisbane GPO.  Mrs Sykes was once a beauty specialist in Burra and on her return to SA she handed it to Miss Lil. Sara who posted it to the family and they will send it to Ivan in their next parcel.
