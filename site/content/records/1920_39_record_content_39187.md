Mongolata Goldfield.  Public Meeting at the Institute.

The Mayor T.H. Woollacott welcomed the visitors.  He said the local members had done all they could to help development of the field in the twelve months since its discovery and a request now for Â£5,000 to develop the field was justifiable.  Requirements were for a battery and water. The present restrictions meant the ore was bagged and handled eight times to get to treatment at Peterborough.  This wore out the bags and resulted in wastage.  The heavy work at the mines meant the men should be getting more rations than those who lounged around the streets and billiard saloons.
