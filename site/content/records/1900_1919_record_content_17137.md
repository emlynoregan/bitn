Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co.  A solar [i.e. a platform] is to be put lower down in Graves’ Shaft and as soon as completed driving will commence.  The drive where a lot of money has already been spent is not giving good results and the grade there won’t pay.  The pump is having trouble which is believed to be due to the slush being worked up.  The inrush of water below 10 or 12ft is considerable and it is not yet known if the pump will cope with it, but so far the indications are positive.  On going to press we learn the Graves’ Engine Shaft operation has been suspended on account of one miner going away, yet capable men are on hand to do the work.
