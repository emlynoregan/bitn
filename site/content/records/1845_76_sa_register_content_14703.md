Notice.  The Directors of the Royal Mining Co. give notice that the requisition calling upon them to call an extraordinary general meeting for the purpose of deciding the propriety of dissolving the company, having been signed by shareholders with only 1,334 shares and not 4,413 shares, being the three fifths of shares provided for by clause 58 in the Deed of Settlement, they are precluded by clause 112 from proceeding to the business proposed, if they call a meeting.  They have therefore decided not to do so.  Only 28 out of more than 300 shareholders have signed the requisition, which has been lying for signature at the office foe six weeks.

Frederic Wicksteed, Secretary.
