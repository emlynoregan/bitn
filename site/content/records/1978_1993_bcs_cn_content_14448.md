BCS in the Schoolgirl & Schoolboy State Athletics Championships

With just five competitors Burra won the trophy for the Girls’ Team, to become the first non-metropolitan school to do so.

Petrea Piggott won four gold medals from four events: the 100 m, 200 m, 400 m and 90 m hurdles.  She was also awarded ‘The Most Outstanding Female Athlete’ title.

There were fine efforts also from Tasma Wooton with 2 silver medals, Cheryl Day with 1 gold and 2 silver, Cheryl Stockman with 1 bronze and Tricia Madigan.  There were four male competitors: Adam Day (2 silver and 1 bronze), Tony Secomb (2 bronze), Andrew Kleinig (1 silver) and Bill Piggott, who did well and was team manager.

Petrea Piggott and Adam Day have been named in SA Athletics Team to compete in Darwin in July.
