Congratulations to the B Pennant team for winning the pennant and so advancing to A Division for the next season.

The shield for the Mid North Association was lost in October at Waikerie, but was regained from the Mid Murray Association at Hallett in April.

Financially it was a successful year, finishing in credit $1,700 after spending nearly $10,000 on assets or improvements, including:

A new tool, equipment and soil shed.

Fourteen new scoreboards.

A new Victa mower.

Painting part of the clubhouse interior.

The Ladies contributed $1,000 towards the scoreboards.

Special thanks to Edgar Pietsch and his assistants for the quality of the greens.
