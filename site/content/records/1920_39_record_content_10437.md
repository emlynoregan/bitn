Burra Football Assoc. 26 March

The debate on the proposed boundaries raised the issue that Kooringa could draw on an area of radius 30 miles while Booborowie had only 8 miles on one side.  Mr Kellaway moved that the radius of thirty miles be taken from the Government Forest and players play for the nearest club to the place where they live and any player beyond the thirty mile radius play for any club he chooses.  Mr Madigan moved each club have its own boundary.  Other amendments followed.  All the amendments were lost and then the motion was put and lost.  Then Mr Willshire moved that last yearâ€™s rule apply and that was eventually passed.

Mr Simpson was elected Chairman & Mr Jackson Secretary.  The program of matches was approved and is printed.
