Characteristics of the paper in 1968

In general a good coverage of local news, though local extends to Spalding and Hallett and south towards Riverton.  Council matters are perhaps less revealing than in some periods, but a mostly reported adequately.

Page 1

Almost entirely local news with 1 or 2 advertisements.

Page 2

Usually dominated by large advertisements for perhaps one third and then by public notices and the like – but proportions fluctuate considerably and there is sometimes a news story as well.

Page 3

Important snippets of what is going on locally and news about past and present resident in very brief form in ‘Out & About’ column.  Births, deaths and marriages tend to get at least a brief mention, making this an important record, though often lacking useful details.  Large advertisements occupy about half the page or more.

Page 4

About half the page is occupied by large advertisements.  The rest is news and items of general interest.

Page 5

Large advertisements occupy perhaps three-quarters of the page with the rest the 50 years Ago Column.

But note that pages 4 & 5 are somewhat interchangeable in content.

Pages 6 & 7

Large advertisements and sports, which is the dominant news on this page, though not limited to it. The ‘Cash Column’ of small advertisements is usually on one of these pages, but can wander elsewhere.

Page 8

This is a mixture of advertisements of varying size for some 4 of the 7 columns.  The rest is the overflow of sport and general news and items of general interest.

Supplements were not frequent, but overflow was often accommodated by printing in the gutters.  This was usually in the 306 gutter, but sometimes in 4-5 gutters and occasionally in the 207 gutter and sometimes in more than one of them.

The supplement on 26 November was larger than a full-sized page and was an advertisement celebrating Sargasso’s 10th birthday – the Burra Agent was Guy Dollman’s Burra Motor Co.  It featured four colour printing and was folded into quarters.
