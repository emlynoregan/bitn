Inquest/Obituary.  J.W. Macdonald Special Magistrate held an inquest on 1 September into the death of Mr T.B. Marchant.  The deceased’s body was found that morning 400 yards from Aberdeen on the Booborowie Road.  He had waited for the evening mail and then left at 8.30 p.m. in good health.  It appears that at a sharp turn of the road there was a pile of white earth from a shaft and his horse must have shied at it.  It left the road for about 100 yards and then apparently stopped suddenly, throwing the rider over its head.  The deceased received a fracture at the base of the skull resulting in death.  The verdict was ‘accidental death’.  Mr Marchant was universally beloved and respected and shopkeepers in Kooringa intend to keep their shops closed during the interment.  Papers found on the body show that among his other labours of love, he was collecting for the widows and orphans of those engaged in the present war*, in which endeavour he had been very successful.  He was a most upright and generous man.

[* The ‘present war’ was the Crimean War.]

[Thomas Balne Marchant died 31 August 1854 aged 28.  BISA entry says he was born 4 August 1826 Freshford, Somerset, UK, had arrived in SA in 1840 on the Fairlie and was unmarried.]
