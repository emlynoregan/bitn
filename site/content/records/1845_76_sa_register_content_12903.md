Telegraph Lines

In the past year the line from Gawler to Burra via Kapunda and Clare has been erected.  The section to Kapunda was opened on 11 May 1859.  The construction to Burra has been completed and is expected to open this month.  At present the only stations on the line are to be Kapunda, Clare and Burra, though requests have been made for stations at Riverton and Auburn.

(A line to Strathalbyn via Mt Barker with a branch to Woodside from Mt Barker is expected to open in February 1860.  Last September a line was opened to Glenelg, principally to get European news to the city upon the arrival of the English mail.)

Connections to Victoria and NSW are to be erected.

A tender was let for the Kapunda Telegraph Station and Post Office in 1859 for £256-1-6, with work to be completed 15 February 1860.

Work on the Clare Telegraph Station and Post Office has commenced and is due to be completed 14 June 1860 at a cost of £725.

A tender for the Kooringa Telegraph Station and Post Office has been accepted for £653.
