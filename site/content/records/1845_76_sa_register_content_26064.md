Booborowie.  28 October.  With cool weather after the heat measles have started anew.  A record area has been sown to wheat.  Contamination with wild oats is a problem.  The time when country folk fear fires is approaching ‘as thousands of pounds worth of property may be sacrificed owing to fires caused by the accursed tandstickors.’
