Burra Town Council, 7 September.

The Mayor reported that the Council’s lease of the Waterworks expired at the end of the year. And it was desirable it be renewed on more favourable terms.  He sought a reduction of the rate of interest from the present 5%, an extra boiler and spare driving wheels for the engine.

Nothing had been heard from the SAR re the Bon Accord crossing.

He asked the Councillors to attend the farewell for Mr Holder.

The road to the Council Depot was not surveyed, but the Mayor thought that it was preferable to wait till they had a number of roads to get surveyed together.

An application had been made to SAMA re the Cemetery.

The Engineer-in-Chief has advised that the expenses relating to retimbering the Waterworks well are: Material £80-19-2 and Labour £134-11-0, piping forwarded and returned re the Public School £2-1-5, Total £198-17-11.

Bagot, Shakes & Lewis write concerning the diverting of water near their yards and ask what the Council intended doing.

Public Works were proceeding as planned.  [Roadwork near the Bon Accord and Bewley’s.]

Tree planting was continuing.

The drain referred to by Bagot, Shakes & Lewis would be done in the coming fortnight.

It was resolved that the Waterworks Committee report next meeting on the lease renewal and machinery replacements.
