Mr A.P. McBride addressed a meeting in the Eastern Telephone Building on 19 August on the coming referendum on the Powers Bill.  He urged a ‘NO’ vote.  He said the Government did not need more powers for repatriation after the war.  There were sufficient under the Defence Act.  Concerning employment and unemployment he argued that in the last depression it was world wide and unitary powers like the UK & New Zealand suffered just as much as the Commonwealth.  The US has similar powers to Australia and does not require more power.
