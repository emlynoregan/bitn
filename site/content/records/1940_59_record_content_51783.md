Burra Town Council, 20 August

Tributes were paid to the late Stanley Kellaway.

The Department of the Interior is still considering the purchase of a portion of Howard Street.

LTO advises a Limited Certificate of Title has been issued for part allotment 80 in the name of SAMA.  An ordinary title can be obtained by providing proof of 30 years uninterrupted and undisputed possession.  [Allotment 80 is the corner of Market Square and Mt Pleasant Road.]

Cr Fisher moved an application for title be made, as a portion of the land gives access to the rear of the shopping area and an e & WS main runs through it for fire service.

Safety wire on the bridge near the Bowling Green will be attended to.
