CHARACTERISTICS OF THE 1924 PAPER

Page 1.  Larger advertisements: mostly local.

Page 2.  Mixture of large and small advertisements and notices.  News sometimes begins in columns 6 or 7, but sometimes the advertisements and notices extend to: -

Page 3.  Sometimes there is a column or more of advertisements or notices, but page three contains the news.  There are no editorials.  Reports are generally brief with those from outer districts often dominating and sports reports being significant.  Longer and more detailed reports are often lists of people attending functions with details of dress etc.

Page 4.  This varies considerably, but advertisements dominate with some news spilling over from page three.  There is no room for ‘literary’ works and only a small amount of pages 3 & 4 are devoted to humorous articles.  Nevertheless items of general interest are found here; ranging from articles on Egyptian mummies to top-dressing of pastures, pearls and pearling, mine safety.  They appear to be ‘fillers’ that could be dropped when news or advertising material was available.
