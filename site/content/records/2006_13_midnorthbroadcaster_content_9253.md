The 30th Anniversary Screening of Breaker Morant drew a capacity crowd of locals and visitors.  The venue was changed from the Redruth gaol to the Burra Town Hall due to the poor weather conditions.  A book of poetry written by Harry Morant and donated to BRTBA by Gaslight Collectables and Old Books was raffled for $730.  Neil Nicholson welcomed visitors on behalf of the National Trust.  Diners had place-mats featuring pictures taken during the filming and were able to take them home as souvenirs.  Meredith Satchell of the Burra History Group prepared a slide show presentation of the whole collection of these pictures. And the military lawyer Commander Jim Unkles spoke of his moves to have the court martial and its verdict and sentences reviewed.  He illustrated his case with a power point presentation.  The overflow of people, who had had their dinner in the supper room, then adjourned to the upper gallery for the film.  The appearance in the film of many locals drew cheers and giggles from the audience, who thoroughly enjoyed both the meal and the entertainment.
