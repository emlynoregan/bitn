Burra Town Council

Council is to write to the member for the district to have telephone communication with the goods shed at the station.

Cr Treloar thought the various gardens were costing more than they were worth.  Perhaps more of them might be taken charge of as Holder Garden was.  They should be planted with something more permanent that required less attention.
