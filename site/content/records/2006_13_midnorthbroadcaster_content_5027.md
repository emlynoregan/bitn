Burra Ambulance Service could close soon if more volunteers do not come forward.  Numbers at present are critical and it is a struggle to maintain the service.  If Burra were to close the next service would have to come from Clare, Kapunda or Eudunda and if they were busy the next ambulance is at Gawler.  The time for attendance would increase from 10-15 minutes to at least 40 minutes.  A meeting for those interested is called for Monday 7 April at Burra Ambulance Station.
