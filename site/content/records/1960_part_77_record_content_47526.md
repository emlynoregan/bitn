Burra Burra Hospital Inc. The Chairman R.K. Pearse presented the 92nd Annual Report.

The financial position was very sound.  [Details are given.]

No major improvements were made in 1969.  The total cost of the Alice Collins Wing was $98,892 and payment of $2,392 was yet to be made.

An intensive care unit has been installed and thanks go to generous donations from the late Mrs G.S. Hawker, Mr F. Reed and Mr J. Barker towards that unit.  This is the only intensive care unit in a Government Subsidised Hospital in SA.  A new ironing machine has been placed in the laundry, the parking area has been fenced and heating installed in the kitchen and domestic dining room.  There are plans in the hands of the Hospital Department to modernise the Maternity Wing and kitchen.   The cropping program this year delivered $1,307.  We continue to be indebted to Mrs S. Scroop and her energetic helpers in the Auxiliary.  Staffing remains difficult.
