Burra Show Society held its AGM at which President Ric Williams said the society was at a turning point and with teamwork further improvements could be made.  The stockbreeders had installed skylights and the Miners Revolution Committee had done well returning a $100 profit on their first year.  Ian Slade has been elected Senior Vice-President and Barbara Frances is the Junior Vice-President.  The show hall will get some attention this year because several groups are interested in using it on a long term basis.  The Societyâ€™s constitution is currently being reviewed.
