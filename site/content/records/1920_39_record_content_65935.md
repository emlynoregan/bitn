Obituary.  James Flower died at ‘Flowerville’ Braefoot near Burra on 17 February.  He was born at Canowie in August 1863, the eldest son of the late Mr & Mrs Joseph Flower.  When he was a child his father took up land at Stony Gap.  He remained home till his marriage in September 1887 to Miss Emily Dunn of Black Springs.  The couple settled at Yongala, farming there for twenty years.  In 1907 he moved to Braefoot and farmed there till about 12 years ago when failing health forced him to resort to grazing and share-farming.  He was a trustee of the Ironmine Methodist Church and treasurer as well.  He was also a steward of the Redruth Circuit.  He was closely associated with the Burra Show Society and for a number of years represented North Ward in the Hanson DC.  He was a member of the Rechabite Lodge for over 50 years.  He is survived by his wife, three daughters and one son: Mrs James Holmes (Sod Hut), Mrs W.H. Lloyd (Ironmine), Mrs G. Murray (Honiton Yorke Peninsula) and Mr C. Flower of Adelaide.  The eldest son Ray Flower fell in the Great War.
