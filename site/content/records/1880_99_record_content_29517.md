Ratepayers’ Meeting re the Waterworks and Water Rates.

The principal subject for discussion was the water rate published in the Government Gazette of 2 August 1888.  The Mayor, P.L. Killicoat, presided.

The town Council had not come to the meeting with a scheme, as the requisition for the meeting had not asked for one.  A telegram to the Hydraulic Department had got the reply that the income expected from the rate declared was £930.  The Conservator of Water had visited Burra an in conversation with him the Mayor had got the impression that the Government was prepared to again hand the Waterworks to the Corporation as it was thought they could manage them more efficiently and so more cheaply than the Government.  He believed this was true and after careful investigation the Government was likely to make an offer beneficial to both parties.

T.W. Wilkinson asked for the yearly costs when the Council ran the Waterworks.

The town Clerk, J.D. Cave, said that the information was not available from memory and he had not been warned or a prepared statement could have been prepared.

P. Lane said he was sorry to see the meeting take the tone it had.

T.W. Wilkinson asked if the figure were about £600.

W.T. Rabbich said £650 was the figure given at the time of the last municipal election.

J.D. Cave then said that as far as possible he would answer.

The total cost of works construction was £8,283

Interest on this to the Government was £232 in 1885, £318 in 1886 and £419 in 1887

The working expenses for the three years had been £672 or an average of £223 p.a. [sic, but actually £224]

The Government had paid £113 for water used by the railways.

W.R. Ridgway’s letter in the Record was misleading in that it totally overlooked the fact that £113 was lost to the Council through the Government not taking water in the last year.

The debt due to the Council by the Waterworks was £112-16-7.  They had paid this year £83-16-0 although receipts were down £113.

J.D. Cave then outlined what the gazetted rates would actually mean as they were not clear to most as published.

For properties with annual values up to £40 the charge was 12½% or ⅛

The next £60 attracted 5% and values over £100 attracted 2½%

For example, take a property of annual value of £220: it would pay

On the first £40	5

5% on the next £60	3

2½% on the remaining £120	   3

Total	£11

P. Lane felt the Waterworks could be worked more cheaply by the corporation than by the Government and he therefore moved:

‘That the Town Council be empowered to make arrangements with the Government respecting the whole matter and that the Mayor should endeavour to get the original cost of construction and how it was made.’  Carried.

He hoped the Mayor could elicit from the Government how costs got to £8,500 although guaranteed not to be [more] than £3,500.

W.H. Vivian asked who had to pay, as he did not need it having a good well and pump.  The mayor replied that all would have to pay if the main passed his door.

W.T. Rabbich moved as an amendment that a committee be set up to go into the matter, but the amendment was lost.

John Jenkins said the promotion of the original scheme has said that the Waterworks would not become a burden to the community and those who did not use it would not have to pay.  Now one man in his street uses it and pays 25/- for the privilege and yet he, who does not use it, has to pay 37/6 just for having the main pass his door.

P. Lane said if the Government had kept their promise to take the water the Council would not have been placed in the present position.

J. Snell thought the scheme’s promoters deserved a leather medal.

W.T. Rabbich moved: ‘That the Government be informed that the ratepayers are not satisfied with the high rate as gazetted.’  Passed
