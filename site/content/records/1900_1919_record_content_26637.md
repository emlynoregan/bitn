Burra Town Council

Permission was given for the Kooringa Football Club to use Victoria Park this season.

It was resolved to write to the lamplighter concerning the unsatisfactory state of the streetlamps at the Kooringa end of the town.

F.M. Pearceâ€™s tender of 27/6 per hundred for jarrah pickets for tree guards was accepted.

A urinal is to be erected in the Avenue opposite the Burra Institute.

Approval was given for the erection of a streetlamp at the corner of Kingston and Quarry Streets.  [Odd, given that they run parallel!]
