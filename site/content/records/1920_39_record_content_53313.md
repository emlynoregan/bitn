Burra Show.

Rain set in at 11 a.m. and consequently attendance was reduced.  The temperature was mild and without wind many people accustomed themselves to the conditions, but those without greatcoats or in light shoes suffered.  Many were sustained by the knowledge of the good it was doing the crops.  Entries were up by c. 400.  President I.J. Warnes was enthusiastic as usual and had a cheery greeting for visitors.  The weather greatly affected sideshows.  The exhibition in the pavilion was excellent.

Art & Photography section was notable for the absence of the latter.  Master Leonard Bence gets a special mention for his landscape in watercolour and Miss Mollie McBride one for her drawing in crayon.

In the Birds Section there were over 600 entries and competition was keen.  White Leghorns were the strongest class, but Orpingtons and Hamburgs were also very good.  Turkeys were particularly good this year and the ducks, drakes and geese were described as an excellent lot.  The pigeons were also a fine collection.

Cattle entries continue to grow with the best competition in the Jerseys.

Cooking was commendable as usual.

Dog entries were not strong in numbers, but were up to the usual standard.

Flower entries were up this year due to the favourable season and space was only found with difficulty to display the entries.

[Personal interest: this year R. Fuss was not listed as a steward and did not get any prizes.  He did give the trophy for champion and reserve champion pansy and both positions went to Mrs E.C. Collins.]
