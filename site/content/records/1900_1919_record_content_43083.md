Utica Copper Mining Co.  Half-yearly meeting in the Institute on Wednesday last.

After beginning a winze at the 100’ level the prospect was poor and after a few feet it was abandoned.  The capital is down to £136.  We consider it would be unwise to spend any more money in exploration.  The liabilities of the company are:

To the Government	£208-0-0

To Horwood & Co.	£37-6-4

£245-6-4

In the last six months William West resigned as secretary and E.J. Davey was appointed at £20 p.a.  The office has moved to the Burra Institute (£10 p.a.)

Messrs Horwood have offered £110 for the engine.  We advise acceptance if you approve total cessation of work.  The directors intend to call a shareholders’ meeting soon to consider winding up or reconstructing the company.
