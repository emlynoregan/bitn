Extreme weather.  On last Thursday, Friday and Saturday it was very still and warm, but during Saturday night a north wind arose, which continued all Sunday as a violent storm with frightful clouds of dust and oppressive heat.  At 2 a.m. on Monday morning the violence increased to such a degree that many roofs and buildings were damaged.  This storm continued till noon, when the wind veered to the west, clouds covered the sky and two sharp showers of rain and hail laid the dust, after which the afternoon and evening were very pleasant.

The anniversary of the United Presbyterian Church was held on Sunday with three special services, but due to the inclement weather the attendance was small.  The tea and public meetings on the following day were, I believe, more successful.

On Sunday three special sermons were preached in the Bible Christian Chapel by Mr S. Keen of Adelaide on behalf of Home Missions and there is to be a public meeting on the same subject tonight.

Bishop Short preached at St Mary’s last evening and confirmed about a dozen young persons.

A rumour yesterday reported a man had fallen down a shaft at the Bon Accord Mine and been seriously injured, but the event turned out to be trifling.
