Mt Cone near Burra has recently been purchased for the National Park Reserve system.  It is the first grassland reserve in the state and protects 465 ha of native grassland with the major plant association being Lomandra multiflora var. dura green tussock grassland.  Open tussock grasslands are rare and endangered in SA.  This reserve is on relatively flat ground on heavy soils.  Over 95% of grasslands have been cleared and it is almost 100% on flat land â€“ most remnants being on slopes too steep for agriculture and have been affected by grazing, fertilizing and introduced species.  Mt Cone has been grazed, but has a history of low stocking rates and low fertilizer application.  (Ann Prescott.)
