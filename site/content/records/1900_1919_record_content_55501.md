The Electricity Scheme.

There was a poor attendance at the ratepayers’ meeting on Monday.  The Mayor was disappointed at the turnout.  Some years ago a £2,300 scheme had been turned down and just as well it was.  Over recent years we have raised £2,000 in a day; surely we should be able to raise £5,000 to £6,000 for a paying proposition.  The mayor read the scheme of Christie & Gardner – estimating 130 consumers for light the capital cost would be c. £4,800 with a charge of 8d per unit for light and 4d per unit for power.  Revenue was anticipated to be £916 in the first year, £1,066 in the second and £1,283 in the third including street lighting.  Working costs for the three years were estimated at £270, £465 & £485.  There would be no battery, but an auxiliary plant.  They would guarantee the Council against loss for two years.  The street lights at present, miserable as they were, cost £170 p.a.

Mr Winnall asked if all Councillors were in favour.  Cr Radford was not.  Cr McWaters was undecided; Cr McBride was for electricity, but against this scheme.  Cr Dane would vote for it as a ratepayer, but as a Councillor he wanted more information.  Mr Turner had offered plans and specifications free.  Christie & Gardner wanted £150.  They had plants in 30 towns in Victoria which spoke for their bona fides.

Cr McBride said Jamestown’s experience was cautionary.  With 247 consumers they had outgoings of £1,779 and an income of £900 and electricity only from 6 p.m. to 11.30 p.m.

Kadina had an income of £1,176, a fuel bill of £750 a year plus interest and a sinking fund on about £10,000.

Mr Winnall moved that there was insufficient information to grant approval.  He said the figures made it impossible to see how a profit could be made in light of evidence from other towns.

Cr Radford 2nd saying the costs seemed greatly underestimated.  Carried & meeting adjourned.
