Obituary.  [Rev. Herbert Stanley Jarvis born 8 December 1876 Camberwell UK: died 18 February 1933 at Burra Mines, residence Kooringa.]

On Saturday Mr Jarvis who was a member of the Burra amateur Swimming Club went to the mine to timber over an old shaft which he thought could be made safer for children.  He left home at 10 a.m. and said he would not be long: he had an appointment that morning with Rev. F.J. Barnes.  At about 11.30 his hat and coat were noticed near the shaft.  An hour later when Mrs Bence noticed the hat and coat still there she informed her husband and alerted Sgt McDonald of Redruth.  Mr Bence got the help of Mr Hindle a Mongolata miner and Mr Trenwith another experienced miner and they went to the mine.  Mr T.H. Villis went past with rope on his truck and joined the search.  The body was discovered lying at the bottom of the shaft.  Mr Trenwith was lowered and at 65ft reached the body.  The air was very bad, but he was just able to attach a rope and return to the surface.  The body was hauled up with the aid of some young men who had come for a swim.  It is thought Mr Jarvis was nailing timber over the shaft and fell to his death which must have been instantaneous.  The coroner T.H. Woollacott deemed an inquest unnecessary.  Mr Jarvis was born at Camberwell on the Kent-Surrey border on 8 December 1876, the second son of E.S. Jarvis the managing director of the Illustrated London News and Sketch.  He was educated at a private school and then came to Australia where he worked on a farm in the South East before taking land of his own.  He became a local preacher and when about 21 accepted the call to the ministry from Rev. Dr G.E. Rowe of Perth and went to WA where he was sent to the goldfields and later was home missionary to men on the pipeline from Mundaring Weir to Kalgoorlie.  On becoming a full minister he served in many parts of WA and later worked in the South Seas Mission and at Port Darwin.  On 2 April 1908 he married Miss Treand Brinkman of Perth and worked in the Perth area.  In 1916 he went to Fiji for seven years.  In 1923 they returned to WA for two years and thence to Pt Darwin till 1931 when they came to SA in interest of his two young sons’ education and health.  He was a great champion for Australian Aborigines.  In 1931 he was appointed to Kooringa.  For health reasons Mr & Mrs Jarvis were making preparations to leave Kooringa when the accident occurred.  In his time in Burra he carried out his duties with thoroughness and dignity coupled with unselfishness, kindness and sympathy.  In his time in WA he was associated with the Young Australia League.  Here he has interested himself greatly in the young people of the parish, assisting with Junior Christian Endeavour & The Young People’s Social League.  The funeral was very largely attended and about 80 cars took part.  Rev. F.J. Barnes officiated.  He is survived by a widow and two young sons: Max & Leonard.  The Saturday afternoon bowls championship was postponed on hearing the news.  The Town Council sent a letter of sympathy when they met on Monday.  The Harvest Festival at Kooringa Methodist Church on Sunday was cancelled and no services were held.  Mr & Mrs Jarvis were to have celebrated their silver wedding on 2 April, the last Sunday they had expected to be in Kooringa.
