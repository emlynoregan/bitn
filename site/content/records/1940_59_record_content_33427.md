Centenary of Methodism in Burra

Kooringa Church was filled to capacity on Sunday for three services of celebration.  The ladies of the Guild decorated the building with flowers.  Many old members of the church travelled from afar for the occasion.  Mr & Mrs Clem Sampson came from WA and Mr E.C. Gould also came from there.  He had not been in Burra for 44 years.  Unfortunately Miss Gert Pearce was too ill to attend.  She had been the organist and Sunday school secretary for many years.  Preacher for the day was the President of Conference Rev. A.D. McCutcheon and Rev. J.P.H. Tilbrook, a former popular minister of the Kooringa Circuit was also present.  Todd Street Gawler Choir was present at each service under the baton of Mr E. Goodger.

[A list of visitors is then printed and the services are outlined.]

The Wesleyan Church was built in 1847 before which services were held in the house of John Chapman.  Rev. John Harcourt was the first minister and lived in the first parsonage built by T. Thomas.  The first choir was led by the late Captain Deeble.  The church was enlarged in the ministry of Rev. H.A. Wilson 1854-58 and when Rev. C.R. Flock came for the second term in 1858 a gallery was erected.  The present church was erected under the ministry of Rev. J.H. Nield in 1914.  The present minister is Rev. H. Hobbs.

The Bible Christian Church began its work in Burra in about 1848 when Mr James Blatchford arrived and with J. Pellew and J. Halse they conducted services in turn.  A society of 47 members was formed and a church and Sunday school to hold 200 was erected.  The first minister was Rev. J. Rowe.  A larger church was built on the corner of Bridge Terrace and Bridge Street [East].  This was closed and sold after Methodist Union.

The Primitive Methodist Church was opened as a mission in Burra in 1849 when the first church was built.  It was opened by Rev. J. Long who was in charge of the Adelaide Mission.  The church had to close when the men rushed to the Victorian goldfields, but re-opened in 1854 when Rev. J.G. Wright was appointed.  There were 2 members â€“ Mr & Mrs Wright.  By 1857 membership was 84 and in 1885 it was 114.  The church continued to make good progress till Methodist Union in 1901.

[Note that Methodist union took place in 1900.]
