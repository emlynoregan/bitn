Obituary.  Alfred Andrew Nankivell died at Burra Hospital on Wednesday 1 December after six years’ illness.  He was born at Burra [Kooringa] 19 January 1876 and was educated at Burra School before working in the district as a farmer, before marrying Mary Ellen Irlam at the age of 25 years.  The couple then went to Broken Hill, where Mr Nankivell worked in the mines.  [The paper omits the line stating for how long.]  On his return to Burra, he was employed by the late Mr McBride on ‘Faraway Hill’ Station.  Later he became a fencing contractor, and then got a team of horses and became a wool-carter.  He subsequently purchased a dam sinking plant and has sunk quite a few dams on stations like Balah, Murkaby, Woolgangi, etc.  In the mid-1920s he sold this plant and turned to a running a piggery before retiring to his home in Chapel Street.  He lost his sight in 1942.  Mr Nankivell is survived by a widow and three sons: W.A. and Walter H. Nankivell of Burra and Edward Nankivell of Adelaide.  There are three grandchildren.  [Death is registered as 30 November.]
