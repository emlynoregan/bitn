Obituary and inquest.

On 2 November at the Burra Hospital an inquest was held into the death of the baby found in a box at ‘Monovea’, the residence of Mr R. Field.  E.W. Crewes as coroner and C. Fuss as foreman of the jury.

Amelia Mary Theresa Field said she had hired Mary Quinn from Mrs Phillips’s office as a general servant about 3 August and she had begun on 7 August.  She did not know she was pregnant.  When she had spoken about her peculiar figure the girl had said she had undergone two operations at the Adelaide Hospital.  She could easily have summoned assistance in the night if she required it.  The box marked A was the property of Mary Quinn.  On 30 October in the afternoon Mary complained of feeling ill.  She retired as usual about 8 p.m.  When Mrs Field saw her in her room at 7.30 a.m. on the 31st she said she felt better and would get up.  She went on with her duties, but about 4.30 went to her room and a little later her door was found to be locked.  She retired at 7 o’clock Thursday evening and got up at 6 a.m. on 1 November and brought tea to Mrs Field.  She then washed some blankets.  Later Mrs Field noticed Mary’s bed was in a bad state and on going into the bedroom opened the box and found a newborn child.  She then sent for the doctor and the police while Mary continued to do household duties.

Mrs Field, who was 75, said she was much upset.

When Dr Sangster arrived he was given all the information and he ordered Mary’s removal to the Burra Hospital.  She left in the company of the police who also took the body of the child.

Dr Sangster confirmed the above and said he thought the birth occurred on Wednesday night 30 October.  Mary was slightly feverish for about a week, but showed no signs of mental aberration.

Mary told Dr Sangster she had not expected her confinement for two months and had hoped to go to her mother’s before then.  She said the child was born in the dark and fell to the floor and when she tried to light the candle to pick it up the pillow fell on it.  That is all she had to say.
