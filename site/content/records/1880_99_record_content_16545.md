Cricket.  Aberdeen and Burra Cricket clubs met on Tuesday at the Burra Hotel to bid farewell to the Waterworks engineer, Mr C. Jobson.  Cr Sampson was in the chair and he gave a speech congratulating him on his work at the waterworks and for the game of cricket in Aberdeen.  Several speakers then followed and an address was read.  Mr Jobson replied.  He said what the town needed was a good pitch.  He could remember playing with the grass so high about every fourth ball was lost in it.  Several songs were sung and a most enjoyable evening spent.
