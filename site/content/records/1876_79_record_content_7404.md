Editorial on a Floricultural Society. A meeting on Friday of the Burra Agricultural Society (the Show Society) considered a flower show, but thought the Society was not strong enough to support a second show. This we think was a mistake. It is now a question of taking up the issue independently of the Ag. Society. If a show is to be held this year steps must be taken at once. The Institute would be a good place to hold such a show.
