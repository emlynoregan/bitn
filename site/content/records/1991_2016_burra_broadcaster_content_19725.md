CWA National President Mrs Margaret Smith is touring SA and will be having lunch in Burra on Friday 17 September in a pooled meal at the old Courthouse.

The CWA is celebrating 70 years* as a service organisation in SA.  On 13 September a 70th Celebration Luncheon will be held at Morphettville Racecourse, when the guest speaker will be Mrs Anne Hetzel, wife of the Lieutenant Governor of SA and Patron of the CWA in SA.

Governor, Sir Eric Neal will launch the New Endowment Board at the CWA Club that evening – containing the names of those who have recently given $1,000 to the Association.  There will be a Thanksgiving Service at St Francis Xavier’s Cathedral at 9 a.m. on Tuesday 4 September and the AGM will be held in the Adelaide Town Hall afterwards.  It will be opened by Lady Neal and SACWA will mark the International Year of Older Persons with a concert that evening in the Adelaide Town Hall.

The CWA Club opened a new catering kitchen at 30 Dequetteville Terrace on 26 May.  Mrs Carolyn Cook, a granddaughter of Mrs Mary Warnes, the founder of the CWA in South Australia, presented a lovely silver tray that had originally been given to Mrs Warnes by the Burra Branch in recognition of her service as President 1925-41† and as State President 1929-41.  The Mary Warnes Room at the CWA Club also houses other items of Mary Warnes memorabilia.

[*Note that this was the 70th anniversary of the state association.  The CWA started in SA with the Burra Branch in 1926.

† This should read 1926-41, since the Burra Branch was established only in November 1926.]
