Obituary.  On 4 February Mr Horace Kemble found the body of a swagman on the southern boundary of Block 112 Mongolata.  The body was near water in Newikie Ck and was shaded.  It is thought sunstroke was the cause of death.  The man has not so far been identified.  He appears to have been about 60, 5’8” tall, bald with grey hair on the back of his head and with a grey moustache.  [Not identified at registration.]
