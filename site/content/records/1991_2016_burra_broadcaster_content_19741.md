The West Burra Landcare Group is made up of a group of farmers around Leighton who were concerned about erosion and salinity problems.  In the past three years they have received more than $61,000 through the Natural Heritage Trust.  The money has been used to build contour banks and drains to direct water to suitable catchment areas, to dig test holes to monitor water and salinity levels.  Their current project is planting 8-10,000 trees around a low-lying lagoon area of ‘Blink Bonnie’ where an erosion and salinity problem is spreading into neighbouring properties.
