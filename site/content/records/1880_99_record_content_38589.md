2nd Leader.  Friday last was the jubilee of Municipal Government in SA and it is an important thing to celebrate, looking as it does after health, roads and the general good of local communities.  The first municipal law was passed late in 1839, but on 31 October 1840 the first Mayor and Council was elected for Adelaide.  Now SA has 32 Municipal Corporations and 139 District Councils.

3rd Leader on the report of Rabbit Inspector Becker.  He says press reports are a gross misrepresentation, but later says â€˜the rabbits are breading so fast that unless something is not soon done they will seriously mar the prospects of the colony.  The report is both grossly untrue and illogical.
