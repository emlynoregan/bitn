National Trust Held its AGM and Trust Director Brian Hodson gave an illustrated address on National Trust properties in SA.  President Kim Michelmore reported on the main activities for 1982.

Much restoration work had been done on the old police lock-up and stables at Burra North.  The stonework has been largely completed.  Now the shingle roof had to go on and some painting was still needed.

For the next three years the concentration of effort would be on the Bon Accord Mine Museum site.

Elected: President, Kim Michelmore; Vice-Presidents, Gerald O’Connor & Dudley Cockington; Secretary, Robyn Page and Treasurer, Avian Pink.
