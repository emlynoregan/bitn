The Eastern Fire

G.S. Hawker MP went out east to see the fire position on Tuesday 5 December.

At Balah a break was being made by bulldozer and units were on hand to back burn.  They were an Army Signalling Unit and Army Cooker on hand.

At Quondong there was the Barmera Unit and Mr Hawker’s utility with a 100 gallon tank.  The fire was then 1-3 miles north of the Quondong-Oakbank Mail Track, but was extinguished by 2 a.m.

The Barmera unit left at 4 a.m. for the Lilydale fire and worked on to late Wednesday, having changed the crew.  It was then ordered out by police on account of the danger.

Mr Hawker left on Wednesday hight, calling in on Rex Warnes at Koomooloo and then reporting to Sir George Jenkins, Minister of Agriculture.  He stressed the urgency of the position, the extent of the damage and that this fire was far beyond the scope of an ordinary bush fire.

He said:

Bulldozers were the most effective means of making fire breaks.

Mobile army signalling units were invaluable.

Every effort should be made to get more of this equipment ans well as more trailer pumps.

Fire Controllers should be appointed for the area.

Subsequently a bulldozer left from Quorn, the Commonwealth has sent army assistance and Frie Controllers have been appointed.

There was some confusion when there was no central information point for the despatch of food and equipment from Burra.  This has since been rectified with Elders, Smith & Co.’s office as the central office.

Mrs David Radford of Canegrass has been a power of strength for the distribution of food.

Mr Binks-Williams and Mr Fabian have been key players in organising the Central Committee.
