Burra Electric Supply Co.

A ceremony to mark recent plant extensions at the Power Station took place on 14 August.  E.F. Marston as Chairman of the Board of Directors started the new diesel unit.  W.H. Sandland Senior Director closed the main switch to bring the new generator on line.  A dinner followed at the Royal Exchange Hotel.

Mr F.D. Taylor on behalf of Messrs Petters Ltd proposed the Burra Electric Supply Co. Ltd.  He said the first engines installed in 1924 were Vickers Petter Engines of 30 & 60 BHP respectively coupled to alternators of the Harland Engineering Co. Ltd.  In 1934 it became necessary to expand the plant and they installed another Petter Engine, this time a 112 BHP.  Again more power was needed and Petters Ltd through their agents the SAFU were given the order for a Petters Superscavenge Diesel Engine of 187.5 BHP.  The latest extensions brought the plant into line with the most up-to-date in the state and the reserve power allowed for further expansion as required and should see the company through for some years to come.
