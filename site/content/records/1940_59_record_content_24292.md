Before the war there was a fine set of grass courts at the racecourse.  Maintenance costs were fairly high and playing fees reflected that.  After several years without use during the war, they are in need of costly restoration.  The Tennis Club at Burra North has been re-formed and the asphalt courts at Burra North will soon be restored to a playable condition.
