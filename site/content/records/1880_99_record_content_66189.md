The Legislative Council Franchise is discussed in a long article by Fred. W. Young LLB, running to 1⅓ columns of small print.

He argues that the objects of the Legislative Council are:

To restrain impetuous actions in the House of Assembly.

To provide stability through a group of men of greater experience, comparative independence of popular election and a longer term in Parliament.

To preserve a continuity of policy.

If the franchise were the same in both Houses the Legislative Council may as well be dispensed with and SA would then be governed by mob rule, by a numerical majority that would be a minority in terms of education, culture and intelligence.

Votes of equal value sounds a fine idea, but in fact it would mean power would move to the cities and within them to the manual labouring class.  Inequality prevails in education, intellect and culture.  An equal say in so far as it extends to protection of life is all right, but should stop there.  It cannot reasonably be extended to the formation of laws to protect property when most have none to protect and are jealous of those that do.  The SA franchise for the Legislative Council is already one of the most liberal in the world.  The people need not fear the Upper House will prove oppressive.  Any necessary measures of reform will, by virtue of merit and public opinion in due time be adopted by that house.  Unsafe legislation will be stopped.

The party in SA today that wishes to ‘level down’ the society would do better to ‘level up’ – increasing the prosperity of all.  The USA and UK owe their prosperity to the fostering of rich men.  Wealth needs to be as free as possible from unnecessary trammels.

He goes on to fear that government by the mob would turn attention to higher taxes on land and/or production and so kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.  Wages would rise, farms would fail, and unemployment would rise.  Lowering the franchise for the Legislative Council is but the first step on this path to self-destruction.
