Burra Town Council

The Bowling Club claims it owns the picket fence at the Fire Station: it had been stored at the Council Depot.

Thomas Woollacott applied for permission to make alterations at Snell’s building – some time after actually commencing work.

F.M. Pearce was granted permission to add to his shop.

Hanson DC.  Thomas McNamara asked Council to grant a piece of parklands for a Soldiers’ Memorial Hall, but was told that Council did not have the power to do so.

Miss Bubb, late Matron of Redruth Reformatory, is not being dismissed, but the position is being abolished.  Questions in Parliament seek clarification and suggest a great injustice would be done to a loyal servant if she were being dismissed from State Service.
