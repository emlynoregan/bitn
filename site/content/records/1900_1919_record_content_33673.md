The Sports Syndicate.  When half a dozen gentlemen secured the old polo club ground north of the railway station to make an area for sports and show purposes, the racing club discussed with them the making of a racetrack on the site, but it was found that extra land was needed.  A. Gebhardt came to the rescue and offered 24 acres of his paddock at the northern end and with little expense a 1st-class track was established.  Now Mr Gebhardt has donated the land to the syndicate free of cost.  This is an important gift as the land is valued at upwards of Â£10 an acre.
