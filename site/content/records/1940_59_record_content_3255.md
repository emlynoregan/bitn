Inter-High School Sports were held at Clare oval last Wednesday.  Clare won the shield, followed by Riverton, Balaklava, Burra & Kapunda.

A.W. Pearce & L. Gill write separate letters to contradict assertions that the Booborowie General Store opened on Saturday afternoons.  Only the sweets fruit, vegetables and cool drinks etc. department was open at the weekend ‘the same as any other progressive town’.

Burra Primary School Concert was held at the Institute on Wednesday arranged by the ladies of the School Welfare Club.  [As you might expect it was a rousing patriotic affair.]


We understand the proceeds exceeded £40.
