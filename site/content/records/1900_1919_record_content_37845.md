There was on page 1 another in a series of articles called ‘Australia Limited’ which is probably a reference to a popular large book of the time which extolled Australia’s great achievements and unlimited potential, called Australia Unlimited.  The writer was ‘Coralinga’ and the line was generally strongly pro-private enterprise, pro-Protestant work ethic, pro-small Government, anti-socialist, and Old Testament attitudes of ‘A tooth for a tooth, an eye for an eye, a life for a life.’  This quote being cited in the article in this issue.  Oddly I haven’t located episode 1, but the others appear as follows:

Article 2 on XXI, 1889, 15 April 1914, p.2

Article 3 on XXI, 1890, 22 April 1914, p.1 plus a letter to the editor by ‘Coralinga’

Article 4 on XXI, 1891, 29 April 1914, p. 1

Article 5 on XXI, 1892, 6 May 1914, p.1
