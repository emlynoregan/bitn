Obituary.  Mr Albert Brandt died 16 May aged 85.  He was born in November 1848 and was an old resident of Burra and a colonist of 81 years, arriving in SA with his parents when aged 4.  He worked at the Burra Mine till it closed and then went to Moonta Mines for a time.  Although his family remained in Burra, he went to work for a while in Broken Hill.  After that he returned and worked for various building contractors including Sara & Dunstan of Aberdeen.  He was invariably described as ‘a tiger to work’.  His one purpose in life seems to have been to do his job and do it well.  He married Miss Catherine Williams 29 September 1874, who died a few years ago.  They had four sons and two daughters, but only two sons survive: [Arthur William George] Brandt of Adelaide and Mr [David] Henry Brandt of Broken Hill.  One son the late August Brandt served with the 3rd Light Horse and died a few years ago of war injuries.  The youngest, Fred, died as a lad.  Minetta married W. Voumard of Kooringa and one of her sons looked after his grandfather in his latter years.  [Albert Frederick was second youngest with August being younger.  He died 9 October 1907 aged 21.]
