Burra Town Council, Monday.

Cr Killicoat reported that another pump had been installed at the pumping station and the supply was now better, but still unsatisfactory.  He felt the mains needed to be larger: 6” instead of 4”.

The Matron of the Reformatory corrected the information re cab fares recently complained of.  There were three passengers including a young child and two of them went back.  The overcharge amounted to 5/-. 

Mr Hall[s] said the Reformatory management showed him little or no consideration, often not intimating he was required until the last moment, requiring him to gallop.  The charge would be less if he were notified earlier.

J.S. Pryor resigned as lamp-lighter, citing insufficient pay (30/- a week).  He could not continue for less than £2 a week.

Christie & Gardiner forwarded plans for electric lighting at an estimated cost of £4,800.  They considered it would be profitable at 8d per unit for lighting and 4d for power.

Information will be sought on the War Precautions Act and whether it would hinder raising a loan.

The road from Dalgety’s Corner across the Black Bridge is to be tar dressed.

Retarring will be carried out on parts of Chapel St, Queen St, Kangaroo St and near the post office.

The Postmaster General will be written to re the extra charge for posting letters at the station – it is not charged in Victoria.
