Editorial on the pending negotiations for the sale of the Burra Mine.

There seems to be some prospects for the reopening of the mine which would be good news for the town.  It is to be deplored that such a valuable mine has been allowed to be idle for so long: two recent bores having proved a mass of wealth under the ground.  Large dumps all over the property contain valuable ore and the old slagheap tells of other carelessness.  We trust the present syndicate will purchase the property and succeed in reopening the mine.
