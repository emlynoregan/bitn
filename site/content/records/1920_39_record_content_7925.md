Burra Hospital.

The Chief Secretary advised that the Government was prepared to subsidise the Maternity Wing to the extent of £1,500 if £2,000 could be raised locally.  John Melrose was prepared to offer £1,000 and Mrs W.P. Barker has offered to increase her donation from £750 to £1,000.  The Superintendent of Public Buildings will be approached about plans and specifications.

There was debate about which wards of which Councils should have been included in the hospital’s area for rating purposes.
