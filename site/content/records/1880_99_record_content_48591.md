In 1888 Mr Frederick King representing a London Syndicate agreed to purchase the Burra Mine for £20,000, but on account of the fall in copper prices after the agreement was made he raised an objection.  SAMA then sued for ‘specific performance of the contract’.  On Friday last judgement was given in favour of SAMA and the balance of the purchase money is to be paid by 2 March 1893.  It is too early to say what the ultimate result will be, but residents hope it will infuse new life into the Mine.  The price of copper is low, but transport costs since 35 years ago have fallen from £1-5-8 per ton to 7/4 per ton for transport to Pt Adelaide.  Dressing ore costs have also fallen.  It is said the two dumps at the mine are 3% copper and if so at £40 per ton would be valued at £266,560.  The mine would pay if properly opened up again and no doubt the new company when formed will do this.
