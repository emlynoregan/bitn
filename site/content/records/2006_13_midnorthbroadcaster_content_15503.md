Advertisement.  There is a full page advertisement from TRUenergy announcing its change of name to EnergyAustralia.  The page expresses the company’s disappointment at the recent decision by Goyder Council not to approve their Stony Gap Wind Farm decision.  It outlines the regional and state wide benefits the company believes would flow from the project and seeks to allay fears about wind farm noise.  It suggests that they are still seeking ways to ‘progress our Stony Gap development’.
