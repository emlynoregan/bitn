Editorial on the Waterworks for 1885.  The report shows revenue of £519-18-0 and disbursements of £518-0-8, but some of the payments were unusual and will not recur.  It is also clear that in the December quarter payments for water were only £9-19-0, meaning that at least £100 must be outstanding.  From this the Editor concludes that a reduction in the price of water should certainly be possible and in all fairness should be made.  He believes that a reduction to 3/- per 1,000 gallons could be made without any loss to the Town Council.
