Obituary.  On Saturday news reached Kooringa that a man had been found dead standing upright in a dismal and secluded hut on Caroona Run about 40 miles from Burra.  It is believed the deceased committed suicide through extreme loneliness and poverty while temporarily insane.  He had been hired on 17 April as a lambminder and sent to the hut at Hog Back.  In a few days it was noted that his flock was drifting and a search of the area failed to find him, but no one looked in his hut.  Last week an old man whose sight was defective was given the care of the flock and when he entered the hut thought he saw the deceased standing alongside his bunk, his eyes wide open and quite dead.  He informed Mr Austin who investigated and found the man hanging from one of the rafters with his hands at his side and his feet touching the ground.  There was no sign of a struggle but the neck was dislocated and it is conjectured he jumped off the bunk and death was instantaneous.  He was Thomas Müller, aged 37 and a German by birth.  Nothing could be ascertained about him except he had apparently been a clerk and was living in extreme poverty.  An inquest was deemed unnecessary, especially as a dozen men could not have been found within ten miles of the spot.

[SA Deaths CD says he was Thomas Muller aged 37 who died 25 April 1869 on Cachowla [sic] Run.]
