‘Boulder Block WA’ writes about the Burra Mine asking why the directors do not go in for thorough development of the mine instead of merely allowing tributers to get at stuff known to exist around the open cut.  The mine should, he says, be drained to the 100 fathom level of Morphett’s Shaft and Grave’s Shaft be sunk to the same level.
