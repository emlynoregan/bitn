Electric Street Lights

On 4 July Mr Parsons for Delco Light put a scheme before Council.  He could give an estimate of the cost for lighting Kooringa.  The Aberdeen end of town would cost less.  He assumed the plant would be on a Council block at the rear of Drew & Crewes and would supply one 400 candlepower, two 200 candlepower, two 100 candlepower and twenty-one 50 candlepower lights.  The cost with everything found, but the building would be £1,582.  He thought the latter would be about £120.  The plant was to be automatic and would consume one gallon of kerosene in 1½ hours on full load.  He assumed an average of 3½ hours a night.  At Victor Harbor the attendant got £37-10-0 p.a. for filling and starting the machine and seeing that the timer was working.  The battery would last three years and replacement plates currently cost £160.  The engine should last at least 20 years.  The scheme could be going in 7 weeks.  About £3,000 would cover both ends of the town.

The Council will now consider the matter thoroughly.
