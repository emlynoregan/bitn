Royal Dramatic Co. arrived in Burra on 6 October and played five consecutive nights to very small audiences.  The pieces were fairly well done, including: Saved from the Sea, The Lancashire Lass, Collen Bawn and Fun on the Bristol.  Saturday night drew a bigger audience and the company managed to get away on Monday.
