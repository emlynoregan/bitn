St Mary’s, Burra.  Repair work has begun and it is expected to be completed by 31 March.  A special recital by Adelaide organist John Hall is planned to mark the conclusion of the work.  Concrete pointing is being removed and replaced with lime mortar to eliminate dampness entering the church. Work will also be done on the parapets and capping and some new iron will be placed on the roof.
