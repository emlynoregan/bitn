Burra Town Council.

Mr Holder MP attended the Council by invitation and reported his discussion with the Government and the Conservator of Water.  The question of the capital cost and the rate of interest might be evaded by the offer to the government of £300 p.a. for the complete works.  This was £120 less than the old rental and equivalent to 5% on £6,000, which the Corporation hold to be the fair value of the Waterworks, rather than the £8,420 hitherto reckoned by the Government.  The railways were currently being charged the same as other customers.  The Attorney General was not sure whether the Corporation had the same power for rating as the Government, but that would be placed beyond doubt by the Waterworks Bill now before Parliament.  The Conservator thought they should be able to carry on the Waterworks for £400 less than the £930 the Government rates were aimed to raise.

Cr Pearce moved that an application be made to lease the Waterworks from the Government for £300 p.a., providing the rating powers vested in the Government be transferred to the Corporation.  Passed.

There was a letter to Council from W.H. Hardy, seeking information concerning the use of water on reserves.  The key question was ‘Do the Corporation know of any Ratepayer, having used water in any reserve for private purposes, who objects to pay for same?’

The Council prevaricated, claiming they ‘could not agree as to facts asked for’.
