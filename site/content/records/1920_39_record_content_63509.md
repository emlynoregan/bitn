‘The “old boys” of your town’ write a letter

‘to thank hes Wurship the Mear, he’s Councillors and Townspeople fur the Grand time the’ ase gave us all.’

‘Now we do want to tell he that we was as proud as peacocks when we seed the frustrate job you had done to celebrate the Centenary and to welcome us all home once more to our old Town to see he all, the deckerashions in the streets and shops wus wunnerful and looked frustrate, we cud not find a lot of old friends and mates homes, but they tell us that a lot of them had shifted to the cemetery.’

Clement C. Snell writes in more conventional English to express much the same sentiments.
