Flying Officer Ron Carpenter was the subject of an article by The Mail war correspondent F.C. Folkard.

He is operating from somewhere in Belgium and at the time had just done 13 missions over the Third Reich in 14 days.  The pilots rise at 5 a.m. and snatch sandwiches between briefings.  They have been attacked by enemy fighters and encounter heavy flak in important areas of Germany, though elsewhere the ground barrage is meagre.  Their job is to destroy the funnels through which the Germans are bringing up supplies to meet the threatened Rhine.  Railway centres like Dorsten & Haltern are key targets.  Both air crews and ground staff are working around the clock, with hardly time to eat.  Ron reported bombing a train from end to end and not being sure before how accurate their instrument bombing was, but that event proved it.  Ron is the son of Mr & Mrs John Carpenter of Medindie and previously of Burra.  John Carpenter saw a lot of action in WWI.
