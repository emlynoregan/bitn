AGL is considering a major expansion of its Hallett power plant.  It has lodged a development application that would more than double the generating capacity of the gas fired peaking power plant.  This reflects the view that demand for peaking power generating capacity will continue to grow.  Development plans and consultations would take to the end of 2005 and actual building, if work goes ahead, would not be completed before late 2007 or early 2008.
