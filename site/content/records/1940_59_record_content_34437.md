Burra Town Council has called for a report from its Health Officer on the living conditions at Paxton Square.  Council said it did not want to put people out on the street, but did want better living conditions.

Cr Marston said the presence of Infantile Paralysis in the state was cause for caution.  Authorities said it bred in dust and filth.  Paxton Square was a semi-slum and not under the most hygienic of conditions.  If an epidemic broke out there it would spread like wildfire.  People deserved better than flag floors and bad lavatory accommodation.  Rents might have to be raised to cover renovation, but most people received either good wages or pensions and could afford slightly increased rents.

Cr S.J. Woollacott said there were sub-standard people as well as sub-standard housing and normal people kept dwellings clean, no matter what sort of dwelling it was.  Dirty people made a clean house filthy in no time.  Paxton Square had spotless homes and some filthy ones.  The housing problem made the question an awkward one for Council.

Cr T.H. Woollacott said there were houses in Burra worse than those in Paxton Square.  Before any house could be pulled down Government permission was required.

Cr Baulderstone agreed and said those in really bad condition were caused by the occupants.  Other parts of the town would reveal similar conditions.

The Mayor said he estimated there were 75 sub-standard houses in Burra, but the Housing Trust put the number higher, judging just on external appearances.

Cr T.H. Woollacott said worse existed within 200 yards of the GPO [in Adelaide].  He said in Paxton Square many privies had no covers for the seats, flaos [sic: presumably for ‘flues’] at the back, or lime handy for use.

Cr Marston didn’t want it condemned, just renovated and a decent sanitary system installed.

A second motion was carried extending the Health Officer’s report to all houses unfit for human habitation in Burra.
