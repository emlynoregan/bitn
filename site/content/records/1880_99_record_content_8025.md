Rev. J.G. Rowe [In the last issue he was G.E.!]  preached at the Wesleyan special effort last week and was much appreciated.  He is likely to succeed Rev. W.A. Bainger in Burra next year.  The new parsonage is now completed and it is a comfortable and elegant building.  The total cost is Â£1,050.  It is hoped the next bazaar will clear it of debt.
