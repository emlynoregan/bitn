Advertisement.  A 2-page advertisement marking the 10th anniversary of Décor Made Easy, including an article on its history by Stephen Angel.

In 1977 I gained employment with Matthews Emporium in Burra and was trained in floors, curtains and furniture and eventually also took over buying and selling of men’s and ladies’ clothes as well as the furniture department.  After winning a number of awards for window dressing, I undertook Interior Design and Decorating courses.  In 1987 Ross & Dianne Drew decided to close the Emporium.  In October of that year with the support of Maryanne, we bought the original furniture building of Matthews and started Décor Made Easy.

In later years we have contracted our floors to Adrian Green and curtains to Russell Murphy.

In the last few years we have opened up ‘Creative Displays’ – for wedding receptions and public dinners – most recently the Opera in the Outback displays.  Our next plan is to employ another person to be trained full-time, as I was twenty years ago.
