The Antarctic Fair in aid of the Redruth Methodist Sunday School Building Fund on 17 March at the Institute was very well got up.  Rev. E.M. Ingamells explained that the want of accommodation has been felt for many years.  Two years ago James Reed said he would give £ for £ up to £1,000 towards the cost of a building and for months now collecting had been going on.  Mrs Thomas opened the fair.  The fair was a great success and it is anticipated the profit will amount to £270.
