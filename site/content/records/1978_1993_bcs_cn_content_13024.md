21 August 1986

The Redruth Gaol Copper Festival Event will be known as Sheâ€™ll be Riot and preparations are well in hand.  Students, artists and production people from the project will begin a two week period stay in Burra based at the old Court House at Burra North from 23 August.  They will be working hard at the Gaol and the Town Hall to bring together all the ideas and sequences they have been working on so far.
