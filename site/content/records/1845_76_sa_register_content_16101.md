The migration to Newcastle continues and numbers of families are still preparing to depart.  The Mining Company has pulled down a row of tenements previously occupied by miners and there are a great many unoccupied houses in various parts of the town.

Collections have been made on behalf of the Lancashire Relief Fund in the Wesleyan Chapel and the result is about £18, which it is intended to make up to £20 before remitting it to the Adelaide Committee.
