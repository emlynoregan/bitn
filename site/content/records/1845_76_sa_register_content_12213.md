Obituary.  A young man called Monro, at Mt Bryan Station, cut his femoral artery while cutting up a sheep and bled to death before help could be obtained.

[This death seems not to have been registered unless it appears as John Munro aged 21, but his other details do not accord with the above report.  His death is said to have occurred at Burra Mine on 21 February and his place of residence was Adelaide, so neither the date nor the place fit the report.]
