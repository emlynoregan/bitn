Burra Town Council, 16 March

Permission was granted for additions to the Kooringa Hotel.

The Mayor had visited a pool in the north built for Â£400 and believed the like could be done in Burra.

Cr Sampson supported this view after visiting Jamestown.

Crs Kellaway & Jennison also spoke in support of a pool.

After discussion a spot for a pool was suggested near the Kooringa Playground on the bank of the Burra Creek.

It was resolved that the Mayor prepare plans and specifications for a pool about 75 ft x 30 ft with a gradient depth from 3 ft to 7 ft.

With respect to the proposal to use the Council Depot site for tennis courts, the Mayor said that opinion was that the site was too short.  He said the Kooringa Club would have seven courts ready by October next and therefore no more would be required.  A long discussion followed because the new courts referred to were grass courts near the golf links, but no resolution was found to the problem and the matter dropped.

Cr Sampson applied for leave for the rest of his term because he was leaving for WA that week.  Granted with regret and thanks for his work whilst on the Council.
