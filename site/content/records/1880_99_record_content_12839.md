Burra District Elections.

A meeting at Saddleworth on 4 April is reported.

Mr Rounsevell accused Mr Holder of deliberately misrepresenting him in order to benefit his father-in-law, Dr Stephens, who is a candidate.

Holder said he had proposed a 5% tax on the actual value of land, which is preposterous.

Mr Ridgway spoke and so did Dr Cockburn.

Mr Holder, who was present, asked to be allowed to reply.  He admitted one error in a fifty-three-line article for which he had apologised.  (He had said a tax of 5% rather than an assessment of 5%.)

Rounsevell said he had proposed first a land tax and then an income tax and then after the gradual abolition of subsidies, a stamp tax which Holder said would add  £1 tax to every man, woman and child.  Dr Stephens had no knowledge of the editorial and should not be damaged by assertions to the contrary.

Mr Rounsevell said Mr Holder’s explanation was specious.
