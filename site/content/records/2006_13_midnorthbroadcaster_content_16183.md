Burra & Community Christmas Fair was a success with a colourful pageant and 230 children taking part in Santaâ€™s Trail collecting goodies en route.  Burra Cricket Club put on a great barbecue and the rock-climbing wall and bouncy castle supplied by YAC were popular.  [Competition winners are listed.]
