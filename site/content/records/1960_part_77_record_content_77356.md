Hallett & District Schools Athletics Association

An article outlines the Association’s history at some length.  The inaugural meeting was of teachers only on 14 April 1928.  A later meeting resolved that each school committee appoint two persons to assist the teachers.  The first meeting at the Hallett Oval on 3 October 1928 arranged sports for those from under 7 to under 15 and included novelty events as well as conventional athletics.  A special train came from Terowie and the schools represented were: Whyte-Yarcowie, Terowie, Mt Bryan, Booborowie, Willalo, Ulooloo, Hallett, Booborowie North, Petherton, Narrowie and World’s End.

In the early years a dance was held in the evenings.  This became a concert and dance and continued till 1950.

The exhibition component of the gathering began in 1929.  Meetings continued till 1941 when petrol rationing caused the only postponement of the event.  Over the years team events became increasingly important.  Over time other schools participated including, Mt Bryan East, Ucolta, Sunny Brae, Yongala Vale, Hundred of Whyte and in later years, Burra.  For some years there were special events for Correspondence School children.  The last Executive Meeting of the Association was held on 19 August 1975 when it was resolved to present the balance of money in the account to the St John Ambulance Centre in Burra.  Trophies were distributed to schools and written records were donated to the Burra National Trust.  Of the seventeen school at some time involved, only three were affiliated at the time of the last sports day on 18 April 1975; Hallett, Mt Bryan and Burra.
