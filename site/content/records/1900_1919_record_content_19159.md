‘Another Disgusted Shareholder’ writes accusing the directors of the Burra Burra Copper Co. of being dogs in a manger.  Copper prices are over £100 a ton which 30 years ago would have kept the old mine going and enabled them to go down to a decent depth and to have opened up the sulphide bodies.  The last shots fired at Morphett’s Shaft are said to have broken ore of 45%.  Another old miner reports rich ore at the 300ft level of Peacock’s Shaft and there are other reports too.  A mine in Queensland is said to be paying on 7% ore and that with cartage of scores of miles to the railway.  The only inference to be drawn is that the directors are incompetent and should give way to better men.
