Market Square.  The revised plan for the redevelopment of the square has been completed and Council is now awaiting approval from the Department of Environment and Planning.  Changes had been made to the size and design of the traffic control mounds and to the type of materials used in the construction.  The changes follow an outcry at a public meeting last year.  A meeting last week involved the Burra Burra DC, the Heritage Branch of the Department of Environment and Planning, the Chairman of the National Trust in Burra Mrs Maureen Wright and Mr Gerry O’Connor.  Mrs Wright said the plans were not very different from the original concept.  The Engineer had satisfied the Road Traffic Board and legal requirements, but had not taken into account heritage aspects.  A major problem was that there is a major highway through Burra and the lighting appropriate for a highway looked absolutely horrible in Market Square.  A final decision of lighting would have to be made within the next fortnight.  Mrs Wright said she hoped the final design would be publicly displayed.
