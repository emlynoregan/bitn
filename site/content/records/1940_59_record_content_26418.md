I.E. Wohling and others of the 2nd AIF submit a letter on Sunday sport in response to ‘Old Burra Girl’

[A few extracts will give the flavour.]

‘When in the army the only day we had a chance to play sport was on the Sabbath and not often at that … had to fight on the Sabbath and carry out orders… While we were away fighting in the rain with mud and slush up to our elbows, we often pictured people sitting back in front of the fire in Aussie listening to the Radio and saying “Why Worry, They’ll Save Us.”  Now many of us have come back after five years of hell and we feel we are not wanted.  Before going away we always understood that we would get our jobs back and that chaps who had businesses would be able to start up again.  There’s even a returned man in this town who wants to restart his business, but many of the people are against him starting again.  It is about time that the people of this town not the rehabilitation officer woke up and gave the Diggers some of the things they have missed during the past years.  As Old Burra Girl said “Keep Ye Holy the Sabbath”; also she said it was a day of rest.  It may have been for Old Burra Girl, but it was not for us, we even had to kill on that day.  Did we stop to argue then?  No.  Yet there are people trying to stop Sunday Sport and Betting Shops.’
