The Pascoe Collection was opened for viewing at the Town Hall on Monday evening.  It was opened by Max Rayner, the last remaining member of the management committee that bought the collection of stud sheep photographs.  The photos featured studs from the early twentieth century.  Three bloodlines dominated in those days: Murray, Bungaree and Koonoona.  They gave rise to sheep known as the SA type.  Other names of note were Hawker’s Anama, Henry Collins’ Lucernedale, Gebhardt’s Mokota, Mortlock’s Martindale and John Collins’ Collinsville.  John Collins and his son Arthur (Fatty) ran the stud, making a name for themselves and getting world record prices for sheep around WWI and in the 1920s.
