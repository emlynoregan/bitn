Booborowie Centenary

The first settlement in the area occurred in 1843 when William James Browne & John Harris Browne arrived.  J.H. Browne accompanied the explorer Sturt to Depot Glen on one of his expeditions and kept his eye open for suitable pastoral land.  The land was held on annual licence.  In the Government Gazette of 12 February 1846 the Browne Bros. applied for additional land westward of the Mt Bryan Range and in that of 10 February 1848 a licence was granted for further adjoining land.  The site of the original homestead is not known, but in 1846 James Browne purchased section 1000 comprising 80 acres, at £1 an acre and decided to make a permanent headquarters.  In 1857 Waste Lands of the Crown Leases were granted in lieu of occupational licences and lease 130 Booborowie was granted to W.J. & J.H. Browne.  It was originally of 153 square miles at 15/- per square mile per annum.  In 1860 the Hundreds of Ayers and Anne were proclaimed and lease 130 was reduced to 28 square miles and assessed at £2-2-6 per square mile.  In 1863-4 the Hundred of Ayers was divided into sections.  Ayers is named after Sir Henry Ayers MLC from 1851-93.  Sections were offered for sale in 1864 and from 1864 to 1867 Messrs Browne bought 4,978 acres for £57,821 – ample proof of their faith in the grassland of Booborowie.
