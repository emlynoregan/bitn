Burra Town Council, 1 October.

SAMA has agreed to pay £25 p.a. for water.  The total guaranteed is now £330 and as this is almost the sum required for the first year and consumption would increase after that the Council seems to be safe in accepting the offer.  A ratepayers’ meeting to discuss it is called for 8 October.
