C.A.S. Hawker gave a lantern lecture on 4 September to a fair audience at the Burra Institute, on his recent trip abroad.  The Mayor presided.

‘Mr Hawker spoke in commendable terms of how Germany, Poland, and lesser nations are trying to reinstate themselves.’  In Russia ‘he saw for himself the awful plight of peasants under the “Collective system” etc.’
