Weather.  There has been a lot of electrical activity to the east and rain in very confined areas has filled a few dams.  Thomas McBride of Redcliffe had had several dams filled and yet so limited are the storms in that area that the homestead only got 0.04 inches.  Oakfield also had similar downpours and there Mr Claude McBride has two dams filled.
