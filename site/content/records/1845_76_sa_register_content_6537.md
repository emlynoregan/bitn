NSW Gold Fever. [Editorial]

The NSW gold fever will undoubtedly affect us here.  Prices of provisions will rise and workers will be induced to go there in even greater numbers and with greater disturbance to economy to an even greater extent than was occasioned by the California Gold Rush.  Many of those have returned broken in spirit and health.  Few returned richer.  We fear the NSW rush will prove to be a delusion and a snare, but will nevertheless have a hard impact on property and the labouring class in this colony.  ‘We assert that as yet no case has occurred where the labour bestowed has been adequately rewarded.’

‘It is to be feared that excessive disappointment will attend the majority of gold-seekers.’

The traveller will find prices for provisions have risen hugely.  If disappointed, he will find himself in a colony where wages are half that in SA and employment is always scarcer.  With a £1 per month tax for a licence to work, no slight success will be necessary.
