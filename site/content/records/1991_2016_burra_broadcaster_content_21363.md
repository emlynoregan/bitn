Burra Town Hall

The Steering Committee has completed a report after several months.  The report provides Council with a set of proposals aimed at ensuring the Town Hall remains a vital part of the town’s heritage as well as a being very much a part of the life of the modern community.  Vincent Burke, Chairman, said that while it is a proud witness of nineteenth century heritage, the ideas will ensure it remains a lively part of community life in the twenty-first century.  Key proposals are:

Upgrade facilities to ensure they are safe, convenient and suitable for all purposes for which the hall has been used, including public performances and entertainment.

Establish monthly film nights.

Develop its potential for small conferences, meetings, seminars and make the Town Hall a focus for promoting Burra as a conference destination, working with other businesses which can provide vital services for such events.

Make a conscious effort to attract weddings to Burra, utilising the Town Hall facilities and the services of other businesses and facilities.

Establish with Federal Government funding a Telecentre or internet Café, for which there was a strong response from the community.

Use this café as a training centre for local community members to learn more about computers and modern technology and information systems.

Establish a Civic History Room reflecting the town’s civic heritage and historic role as capital of the merino industry.
