Burra Hospital Board.

It was decided to postpone signing the agreement re infectious patients with the Local Board of Health till the report on the enquiry is in.

The question of the legality of the Mayor’s position was raised, but nothing was resolved.

The subsidy position was serious.  £800 of the £1,000 has been spent with five months to go.
