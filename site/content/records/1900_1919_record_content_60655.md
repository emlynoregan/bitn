E.W. Crewes writes concerning the Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial.  He stresses that right from the start he had been supporting a memorial/statue to perpetuate and honour the memory of the fallen.  A letter asking the District Councils to appoint delegates for a meeting resulted in only the Burra and Booborowie delegates attending.  The Burra DC agreed to join in.  Booborowie has decided to erect a hall, but said we could expect some help from the people there.  Mt Bryan said they had also decided to erect a hall and so cannot join in.  I am given to understand that Hanson and Apoinga are prepared to do what they can to help.  I can hardly believe that any district would like to see a statue erected in Market Square and have the names of boys who fell belonging to that district omitted from the memorial.  The idea is to have a panel for each district.  I cannot conceive of a statue being erected unless it contained all the names.  A time has come for a start to be made and I appeal for donations and respectfully request the acknowledgement of the same in the Record.  Peace Day on or about 4 August will be a day for a special appeal for the memorial.
