Letter.  Alistair McPhee writes with a somewhat different take on the ‘Miss Popularity’ series.

‘Australians have no dignity left to lose, if loss of dignity is defined by a modicum of curiosity in the production of an ironically named ‘reality television’ program.’

Witness Big Brother, The Block or Survivor to name but three.

The girls involved are responsible for their dignity – or lack thereof – not the ill-informed judgement of a condescending philosopher.

The public enjoy these shows due to their ‘schadenfreude’ nature and it has always been so.  While Australians may have to live down presentations of themselves in some ghastly portrayals, the ocker image is easier to live down than one as a ‘complicit human rights abuser’.

The phenomenon will be around for many years to come, is bigger than Burra and so we should be grateful to

‘…suckle at the teat of the great scripted behemoth and use the nurturing it provides to further improve our spirited town.’
