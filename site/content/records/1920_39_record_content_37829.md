Burra Brass Band Concert in the Institute 25 March drew a very enthusiastic audience.  Despite one or two short-lived attempts this is the first really successful revival of a town band since the Cheer-up Ladies Band dissolved in 1919.  J.H. Murison as bandmaster has now thought the 28 members sufficiently proficient after four months practice.  The audience received a full measure of enjoyment.  There were song and instrumental solos between band numbers.  Takings were good at £22, half of which will not go far in purchasing new instruments.  90% of the instruments in the band date from the old Coronation Band started in the time of Edward VII*.  The band practises in P.W. Clarke’s schoolroom (late Hon. J. Lewis’s) and in hot weather in his garden, for which the band thanks him.

[* Note that it was formed in 1911 and so was named for the coronation of George V not Edward VII.]
