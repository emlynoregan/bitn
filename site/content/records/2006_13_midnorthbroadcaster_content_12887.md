The Warnes’ 1913 Newton Bennet

Les Warnes’ 1913 Newton Bennett made its final run to Birdwood recently and it will now take its place there among dozens of other vintage and veteran cars.  The car was handed over to Les by his father in 1937 on Woolgangi.  Les had been driving out there since he was 12 when the family had a 501 Fiat (1927 model).  The car had originally been owned by Dr Sangster [Jnr] of Burra.  Mr Warnes has driven the car in many Bay to Birdwood Rallies.  He and his brothers also drove in veteran runs in 1942 & 1943.  Les used the car for rabbit trapping when he was young.  The original parking lights were kerosene powered and the headlights used acetylene gas.

[The article says Les is 92, but retracted it in the next issue.  They did not say that he was in fact 89.]
