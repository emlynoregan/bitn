J150 Copper Trail Commemorative Walk

Groups of students from Mid North schools will walk the old Gulf road in May 1995 as they re-enact journeys made by miners from Burra to Kadina last century.  The Copper Trail Commemorative Walk is planned to end at Kadina on the weekend of the Kernewek Lowender celebrations.
