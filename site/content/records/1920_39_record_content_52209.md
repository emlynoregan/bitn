Arbor Day at Copperhouse School last Friday.  Rev. E.G. Neil addressed the pupils on tree care.  Mr G. Finch spoke on birds (good & bad).  Flowering gums and wattles were planted on the east side of the school where recently surveys of the school lands were made.  The children were each given a naval orange and a half-holiday was declared.
