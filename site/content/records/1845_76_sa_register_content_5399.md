Henry Nankervis was charged by James Edward Bromley with hooting after him and calling him a lag.  Nankervis admitted the charge and apologised.  His Worship said the offence was regarded by the law as a very grave one.

‘The complainant was now a respectable young man, and whatever he may have been formerly no person was justified in taunting him with it to his injury and annoyance.

‘Complainant stated that he did not wish the defendant to be punished, his object being only to assert his right to the protection of the law; and as defendant had expressed regret, he would wish to withdraw the information.

‘His Worship would only allow it to be done by the defendant paying costs.’
