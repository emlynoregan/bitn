Samuel Trevena was fined £2-10-0 plus £1 costs for assaulting Police-trooper McKenzie while in the execution of his duties.  Last week McKenzie stopped Trevena for furious riding at about 9 p.m.  Trevena refused to give his name and the policeman refused to let go the rein and a scuffle ensued.  McKenzie also said several of Trevena’s friends also intervened, but could not be identified in the darkness.
