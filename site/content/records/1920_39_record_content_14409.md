Burra Hospital Board meeting of 26 November.  The Chairman says the hospital is now sound financially, if the Government pays what it owes.  The Inspector General of Hospitals had visited during the month to discuss the money that needed to be raised for the maternity wing.  This was set down at £600 for the period January to June and the Inspector General suggested the local rate be £200.  The Chairman has drafted a letter to the government pointing out that when the statutory reductions on receipts had been made the Government still owed £710 and even if the overdraft were deducted it was £386.

No subsidy had been paid from June to October, which is what caused the overdraft.  The Chairman suggests Councils be asked to pay 3 monthly instead of 6 monthly to help smooth income flow and reduce the need for an overdraft.  An application for a grant of £200 towards the maternity wing building fund has been granted.  Mr Riggs said Mr Sampson’s report was very misleading in that it anticipated a condition which would probably not occur.
