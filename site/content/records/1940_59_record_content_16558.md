Burra Institute Committee concluded recently that although the Institute was paying its way, it was not possible under existing circumstances to reduce its debt and payment of interest to the State Bank was using funds that should be devoted to improvements and repairs.  A delegation was elected to discuss the matter with the Town Council.  The State Bank has declined to reduce the interest from 5% to 4%.  The request was for the sale of the Institute to the Council.  The debt was Â£3,159.  Mr F.T. Marston supported the move outlined by Mr A.B. Riggs and said that Council could get a long term repayment loan from the Bank which meant the Institute would eventually belong to the town.  The building did benefit the whole town and the responsibility was a t present being carried on the shoulders of a small section.  The committee simply wished the Council to purchase the Institute for the amount of the mortgage on the day of sale.  The Mayor asked if they were aware of the amount of red tape involved.  Mr Riggs outlined the procedure needed.  The Mayor said the Council would consider the matter.
