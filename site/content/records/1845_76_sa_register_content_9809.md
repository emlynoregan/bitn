SA Mining Association: 11th Annual Report, delivered 16 April 1856.

Most of the relevant information is in the editorial report on page 2.  This official report carries the more detailed financial statements.  It does say that 12 men are sinking Schneider’s Engine Shaft, which is now 3 fathoms below the 50 fathom level.  Drives now connect Ayers’ No. 2, Schneider’s and Roach’s Shafts.  Preparations are in hand to sink Ayers’ No. 1 to fifty fathoms and Roach’s to the 60 fathom level.  The stamps are in operation and working well and the wheelpit and house for the new crusher are under construction.
