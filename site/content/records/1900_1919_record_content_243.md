Burra Departures.

R. McAloney leaves for Petersburg: a useful worker for the Wesleyan Church, tennis club and the Mutual Improvement Society.

F. Trotter leaves for Adelaide: he took charge of the Boys’ Brigade and was a Wesleyan Church worker and member of the tennis club and Mutual Improvement Society.

Mr Fairweather will take charge of the Burra School as soon as his health allows.  In the meantime Mr Kennedy will be in charge for about three months.

The Continental in Dr Brummitt’s garden on Friday was a considerable success.
