Obituary.  Alexander James McDonald died on 11 November in West Perth aged 78.  He was born in the South East of SA where his father owned ‘Glen Roy’ Station.  He grew up among Merinos and as a boy took a keen interest in stud shows.  He became a wool-classer and in 1906 became stud master and manager at Canowie.  For 13 years he was manager for Beltana Pastoral Co. Ltd under the late Peter Waite on the company’s various stations in the north of SA and later was manager for Captain Chirnside of Werribee, Victoria for four years.  He also had stud and pastoral experience in NSW.  Soon after becoming manager for Canowie Pastoral Co. he made history by purchasing a ram ‘Donald Dinnie’ for 1,200 guineas.  This ram’s eight years of service so stamped his image on the flock that no further introduction was needed in the Canowie flock.  Some notable stud rams were produced: ‘Jack Johnson’ sold to a South African breeder for 800 guineas and ‘Majuba’ sold to Koonoona for 700 guineas.  From 1910 for three years Canowie had phenomenal success at the Adelaide Show.  The Canowie shorthorn stud cattle were dispersed at a sale in 1923 and the Canowie Merino stud was dispersed at a sale on 27 February 1925 which realised £41,000 and attracted over 2,000 people to see 4,800 stud ewes and rams sold.  The stud was commenced in 1857, though the run was in occupation by Drs J.H. & W.J. Browne from 1839.

In 1859 five Rambouillet rams were imported.

In 1864 Murray, Mount Crawford rams were introduced.

In 1864-1906 only Canowie bred rams were in use and there were many show successes in Adelaide and the eastern states.  In 1906 Canowie, twelve miles from Hallett, comprised 68,000 acres freehold and depastured 60,000 sheep, but since then has been much reduced by sales of agricultural lands.  In 1923 Elder, Smith & Co. began negotiation with Mr McDonald to arrange that he move to WA to the advantage of sheep interests there.  In 1924 he agreed to work half time supervising the stud stock department for Elder, Smith & co. in Perth and half time was open to any flock owners seeking his services with respect to stud or flock questions.  He retired in 1930, but retained a private office at Elder House in Perth.  He leaves a widow, one son and two daughters: Mrs H.M. Matheson & Mrs Keith Ross.  [Born 8 October 1860 at Lake Roy, District of Robe.]
