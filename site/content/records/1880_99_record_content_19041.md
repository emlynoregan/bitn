‘The City of Big-Big’, first episode.

Letter 1 dated 12 June 1910 from Big-Big

Lapford then had a population of 6,500, deriving its prosperity from coal and iron mines.  It had excellent roads, beautiful walks and shady lanes.

Big-Big had a population of 50,000.  The stream was clear flowing and swift where it used to be ‘yellow, rubbish-strewn . . .’ with ‘broken bottles . . . broken bricks, battered billy-cans, mutilated kerosene tins, legs of chairs, old book covers, bits of fence wire, sharp and ugly sheets of galvanized iron.’

The Big-Big Record is a daily of 16 pages.
