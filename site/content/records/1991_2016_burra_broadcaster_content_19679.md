BCS & Mt Bryan School have been discussing a possible shared future â€“ perhaps with Year 7 at BCS and Mt Bryan offering either R-5 or R-6 in its own right or as a sub-school of BCS.  Discussions have been held with the Hallett Play Centre re moving to Mt Bryan to make use of its excellent facilities.  Mt Bryan will continue as an R-7 school in 2000.  Ms Jackie Cox has tenure to the end of 2000, after which it could well be a sub-school of BCS with a co-ordinator rather than a principal.
