Mongolata Gold Field

The Minister of Mines Hon. S.R. Richards and the MPs for the district Messrs McHugh, Critchley & George paid a visit to the field and made the stiff climb to the top of the hill.  They visited Byles’ Mine.  This is an open cut along the hill, but a great deal of overburden has had to be shifted.  The lode is only a few inches wide, but quite rich.  Mr Mayor introduced the Minister and said he understood about 43 men were working the field.  Cr Bevan acted as spokesman.  He asked what the gold bonus meant: the Federal Government will pay a bonus of £1 on all gold produced in Australia over the average of the past three years – not on all gold produced.  It would be best to sell to the Mines Department.  The works at Peterborough will treat 25 tons free of charge, but only if the privilege is applied for before the treatment.

Would the Department supply explosives?
