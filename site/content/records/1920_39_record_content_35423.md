Harrold Button delivered the new assessment with a lengthy explanation that in a time of depression he had to base the valuations on the earning capacity of the land and that in turn was dependent not on local markets, but on international markets.  Since the last assessment in 1923 there has been a decline in wool to about 50% and in wheat to 40%, when costs of production have been soaring.  These changes had not been anticipated when the 1923 assessor increased assessments by 46%.  Now it seems reasonable to think that conditions will improve from the present.  Wool prospects seem brighter.  Wheat futures are less certain.  A return to 1923 prices or conditions seems unlikely.  Taking all into account Mr Button decided on a 20% reduction on the 1923 assessment.  The lands in his opinion had retained their comparative values and so the 20% could be applied across the board.
