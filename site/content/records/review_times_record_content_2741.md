Mt Bryan Gala Weekend was a great success according to Mrs Beth Oakley, one of the organisers.  About 400 attended the gala ball and the $4,800 raised by the weekend will be shared by ten community groups.  The celebrations began with a procession on Saturday morning, which included three old fire engines from Burra and Clydesdale horses from Geralka Farm.  A float commemorating the 75th birthday of the Soldiers’ Memorial Hall featured old style dancing.  Seven members of the Yankalilla Light Horse, clad in WWI uniforms marched and one float featured an old time schoolroom.  After the parade the book Razorback Country was launched by its publisher Mr Peter Cotton from Adelaide.  It was written by local resident Mrs Ruth Stolte.    250 copies were sold over the weekend.  Mrs Oakley said 400 people attended the barbecue lunch.  In the afternoon the Light Horse Brigade gave a demonstration of tent pegging and there were also sheep dog trials and a blade shearing demonstration.  Hay rides were popular and there was a bus tour of the old Mt Bryan Station and other homesteads.  The oldest former resident to return was Mr Vic Pearce 91, of Adelaide.  Static displays included lead lighting by Helen Reed, floral art by Joyce Lloyd and wood carving by Audrey van Buuren (all of Burra).  Pat Brereton’s water-colour scenes also proved popular.  200 people crammed the hall for the gala ball.  The master of ceremonies there was Mr Tim Butler of Radio 5CK.  Ralph Oakley won the beard-growing contest. Father Lawrie Quinn led the ecumenical church service on Sunday assisted by Uniting Church Minister Malcolm Thomas, Fr Richard Morris of the Anglican Church and Fr Kenny from the Roman Catholic Church.
