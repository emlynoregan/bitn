Burra Corporation

Capt. Sanders in the chair said that the Bridge St Bridge had long been inconvenient and that the replacement should be relocated.

Mr Morris agreed and said general feeling favoured one in line with Commercial St

He alleged 80% of population agreed. The creek there was wider and the flow in flood therefore less violent. It needed the purchase of land from Messrs Statton & Henderson on the west bank, while the east side approach offered no difficulty. He thought that 30' could be obtained with no difficulty, but doubted that was enough. (Compulsory acquisition was not available as it was not a main road)

Cr. Snell thought they would sell 40'

Morris thought 50' desirable and 40' the minimum.

The Corporation resolved to take steps to acquire the land.

On being approached the owners agreed to sell provided it was S of the Nth post of their entrance from Market Square. In return they wanted 100' of the land now set aside for a road +Â£488/15l- cash for a piece of land 40' wide.

Council thought this far too high and decided merely to `receive' the letter.

There was a request for a footbridge at the site of the old bridge.

Cr. Sanders said the remnant of the old bridge contained usable timbers 31' long.

Lipsett & Sanders moved that the new footbridge be made from material salvaged from the old bridge. Agreed.
