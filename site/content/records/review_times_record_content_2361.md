Mr & Mrs Brian Pallot of Victoria visited Burra and praised it for its cleanliness and tourist potential, marvelling at the fine stonework and the character to be seen in the school, churches, Paxton Square and the Gaol.  They only regretted the limited opening times for the National Trust properties and the need to keep places like the Gaol locked because of vandalism.
