First Aeroplane to visit Burra arrived about 5.45 last Wednesday 7 April.  Captain Moore RAF flew in from Farrell’s Flat.  He cut across the western hills to the race course, which was disappointing, as the plane was low in the western sky.  George Thorpe drove to Aberdeen and asked the Captain to fly over the town, which he immediately did, flying low and circling the three towns to the delight of young and old.  He was to have given an exhibition and taken up passengers on Saturday, but the weather was too boisterous.  He did take up passengers on Sunday, among them Miss B. Woollacott and Miss R. Ridgway.
