Burra Hospital

Mining Companies Phoenix Copper and Ellemby Resources have written to the Health Minister John Hill expressing their concern at the Burra Hospital to a GP Plus.

Ellemby is currently doing feasibility studies on the Mongolata Goldfield involving millions of dollars in drilling and trial mining.  It is reasonably confident of starting a gold mine that would employ 30-50.  Phoenix intends to have an ongoing economic presence in the area.  Archer Exploration Ltd is also interested in the region with an exploration licence at the Fairview phosphate mine and the Robertstown Copper Mine.  Both Ellemby and Phoenix regard a local hospital offering acute and emergency care as important and possibly the difference between life and death.

Paul J. Dowd, Managing Director of Phoenix Copper Ltd writes with a copy of the letter sent to the State health Minister, and develops the points in the page 1 article.
