We have heard it said that Unicorn Beer is the best out of Adelaide.

We visited and were taken up the large tower where, c. 60’ high, we were on a landing on which was a liquor vat and other appliances including the malt receiver.  On the next floor were mash tubs with about 25 hogsheads of mash in preparation.  The processes were explained.

On a lower level the liquor was cooled by an ingeniously arranged refrigerator - a series of copper pipes with a flow of water from the well.  From there to the fermenting tubs and thence to the cellar where some 500 hogsheads are kept.  There are seven cellars built of stone and brick and well ventilated.  Except for the tower all buildings are on the ground floor.  Beside the engine room there are storerooms and a cooper’s shop, also a boiler house, cart sheds etc.

The new brick offices are compact and imposing.  The engine-house is below the tower and has a perpendicular engine of 5 h.p.  The boiler is 22’ long and 5’ diameter and uses wood.  Unicorn bottled stout and XXX ales are becoming popular.  The water used is obtained from deep wells on the property and is pure and cool.  Sales are made all over the country between Adelaide and Broken Hill.  There are three brews a week and six hands are employed.  Most beer is forwarded by train though not so long ago much went on drays.  The firm is registered as Messrs Catchlove & Co.  Managing director is E.C. Lockyer JP.  Mr W.J. Jacka, late of Laura, has the general managing and brewing.  The building on the eastern bank of the creek is imposing seen from the main street.
