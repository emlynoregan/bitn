19 of 21 eligible passed and 18 gained certificates.  [Which seems a little odd.  Perhaps there was an age limit involved for the other scholar.]

Plans are in hand to celebrate the schoolâ€™s jubilee in 1928.  The foundation stone was laid by Mrs [sic: error for Mr] Bath in February 1877 and the school opened in January 1878.
