Aeroplane Crash.  Pilot Smith who had been taking passengers for flights had taken on Miss E. Simms and Mr W. Harold Tiver on Tuesday afternoon 3 November and when about half a mile from take-off at the Aberdeen racecourse the engine cut out.  They crashed into Mrs H. Thomas’s paddock.  The plane threw passengers and pilot out, but none was seriously hurt, though the plane was irreparable.
