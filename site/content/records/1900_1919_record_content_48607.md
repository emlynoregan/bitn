At Mackerode Mr A.G. Gebhardt just managed to get Mrs Sangster Senior, who was visiting, inside before she was blown over.  A chimney came down, a tree fell across the verandah and iron flew off sheds in all directions: ‘about 200 out of 400 large trees were torn up or twisted and broken.  He reckons his loss in five minutes at c. £1,000.  A heavy trolly was blown over and a cultivator moved 150 yards.  All shed, stables and outhouses were unroofed and some of the iron travelled ¾ mile.  Water in a dam was lifted into the air about 50 feet and the level in the dam dropped two feet.  Several windmills were destroyed and telegraph poles on the main road were bent, some westerly, and others easterly.  Elsewhere the effects were felt, but less drastically.
