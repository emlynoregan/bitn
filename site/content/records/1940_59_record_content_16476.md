RSL held its AGM on Saturday night when 38 members attended.

Treasurer M.T. Fuller’s report showed the sub-branch to be financially sound.

Doug Keynes reported on obtaining pension benefits for a number of applicants.

President S.C. Genders reported on the year’s activities.  The Anzac Service and March was celebrated as usual and the Salvation Army Band from Croydon attended.  Armistice Day was also commemorated in Market Square, though attendance was small.

Membership is at a record high.  The branch has assisted in many patriotic appeals and worked in connection with graves of deceased soldiers, pensions, military allotments and recruiting work.  Sympathy is extended to families who have members reported missing or killed.  Elected were President, M.T. Fuller; Vice-Presidents, D. Keynes & E.C. Collins; Secretary, A.L. Bence & Treasurer, A. Coverdale.
