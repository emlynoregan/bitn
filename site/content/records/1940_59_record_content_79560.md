Burra Rifle Club fired the 8th stage of the Carpenter Trophy over double 900 yards in the worst conditions and every shooter missed the target on at least two occasions.  The wind varied in strength from 12 to 26 degrees (9 inches to the degree).  Best were R. Bernhardt, W. Barker and T. Brazil in the lowest scores ever recorded on the range.
