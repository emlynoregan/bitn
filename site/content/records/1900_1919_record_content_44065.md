Letter from ‘Aberdeen’.  This is a rather obscurely worded letter apparently about the Council’s purchase of a horse.  ‘There are rumours of a Councillor having an interest in a horse purchased which should be stopped.  I understand Cr McWaters was allowed to buy the turnout and no doubt that gentleman can give us light.’
