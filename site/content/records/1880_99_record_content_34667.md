Reminiscences of Old Burra, by a Melbourne Correspondent.

He recalls a big lode or vein being found that was not less than 17’ thick.

Coaches left the [original] Burra Hotel and travelled via Sod Hut and Black Springs.  He believes they left about 4 a.m. and got to Adelaide c. 8 or 9 p.m.

The old Post Office stood where the National Bank now stands.

Of all the mining captains only Captain William Mitchell rests in the Burra Cemetery.  He was a staunch Primitive Methodist who wrote articles for the London Primitive Methodist Magazine.

David Mackay had a shop in Commercial St opposite Queen St next door to the late Mr Batchelor’s.  He was called a lunatic etc. because he would ride through the streets declaring the end of the world and other absurdities.

There were no state schools, but at St Mary’s there was a school, which was not popular.  Mr Strike had a school at the back of the Wesleyan Church [1856] and he was followed [1857-72] by Ricardo Stephens. (Now Dr. Stephens)  He did more to educate Burra than anyone else and was one of the best local preachers.  Leading local preachers (Wesleyan) were then Joseph Sleep, ‘Daddy’ Goss, & Dr Wilkinson, the father of T.W. Wilkinson the chemist.
