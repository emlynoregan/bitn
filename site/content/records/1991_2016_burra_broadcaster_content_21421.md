Burra Community School Committee AGM was held on Monday when 29 parents and staff attended.  David Nourse, as Chairman of the School Council, reported on the yearâ€™s highlights.  A priority had been to develop Brewery Hill as an educational facility.  The Telstra Tower was finally approved and erected.  In The Basic Skill Test Burra students had fared very well compared with the rest of the state.  The principal, Kevin Fahey, explained that they had decided not to enter into Round One of the Partnerships 21 initiative, but to wait to see what the school would be responsible for with regards to assets and to wait till the present industrial dispute was settled.  Student numbers would increase slightly for 2000, but they were on the very edge of losing a teacher granted in 1998.  The loss of one student could see a staff member removed.
