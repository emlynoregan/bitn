Wartime Incident near Hallett

Mr Casey recently found an aeroplane door on Tiverton Run near Hallett.  It recalled a wartime incident we could not then report.  In a mishap a pilot (Mr Tangey) bound for the West Coast got off course.  At about midnight lack of fuel meant he had to make a forced landing.  He ordered the crew of three to bail out.  They did so, expecting to land in the sea and to get out they had to push the door off the plane.  The pilot then made a forced landing in a difficult spot on Tiverton Run.  The pilot survived and walked five miles to Tiverton Station for help.  The other crew members landed about three miles away and were picked up in a lorry driven by Mr Ding and were taken to Netley Gap Station.
