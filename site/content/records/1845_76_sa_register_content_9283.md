Obituary/Inquest

An inquest was held at the Burra Hotel on 11 August before Dr Mayne on the body of William Mollard.

James Bennett sworn, said he knew the deceased and saw him last alive yesterday.  Between4 & 5 oâ€™clock he was employed raising iron ore for the Smelting Works at the Black Hill, four miles from Kooringa.  I was working about five yards from him.  I heard some rubbish give way.  I looked around and could not see the deceased.  I called to Henry James, my other comrade, that Mollard was killed.  James immediately came to assist and while he went to get a shovel I heard the deceased moan.  It took about five minutes to reach him and when recovered he was dead.

Henry James gave corroborating evidence.  He too heard deceased moan while they were digging.  They were working at a depth of about ten feet and should have considered the ground quite safe.  The verdict was accidental death.  [William Mollard died 10 August 1855 aged 23.]
