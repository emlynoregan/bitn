Burra Pictures.  Residents are advised that the managers are considering closing the show because patrons are unable to enjoy an uninterrupted show on any night.  Talking and wandering by young patrons in disregard of the enjoyment of others can no longer be tolerated.  Council says the next four shows will dictate the future of the pictures.
