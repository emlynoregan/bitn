The Ephemeral Art Trail Launch attracted a crowd of interested spectators.  There were colourful artworks on the footbridge and several interpretive installations.  One is a forest of branches from indigenous and non-indigenous trees behind the bowling green.  Wrapped in muslin bandages and painted in white luminous paint, they are striking in the day or the night.  Henry Jock Walkerâ€™s performance on the ground next to the skate park involved a tractor and various paint throwing devices to produce a number of effective paintings.
