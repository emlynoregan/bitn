Burra Town Council, 15 September

Radford Bros. sought permission to replace a private telephone line from near the eastern bridge on the main road Penclawya St.  Granted.  [This is a complete mystery.  The only street with anything like this name is Penglawdd St.]

A.J. & P.A. McBride advise that T.H. Woollacott will remove the material from the site of Mrs Howell’s house.

A.A. Nankivell offers to rent the old road crossing the creek from Morrison’s to Thames St and the road between Messrs Clark’s & Treloar’s blocks.  To lie on the table.

After considerable discussion it was resolved to use the 1929-30 assessment for 1930-31 with necessary changes.

The stock salesmen are to be written to concerning opening the stock road near James.
