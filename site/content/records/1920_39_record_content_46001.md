Holders of scrip certificates 1-359 were entitled to double their holdings at par before 16 September 1845.  SAMA’s attention went first to discoveries in the Adelaide Hills, but nothing of importance was found.  Then the Gawler Plains attracted attention.  Henry Mildred had oversight of these cases.  He became a notable citizen.  He was first Provincial Grand Master of the Freemason’s Lodge in SA and when a Lodge opened in Burra in 1850 it was he who gave the Provincial Warrant or Charter and the Lodge was called the Mildred Lodge.  Later on the Charter came from England issued by the Grand Master there, the Earl of Zetland.  Both Charters are preserved at the Lodge in Burra.  About this time a rumour in Adelaide suggested a valuable mining district had been discovered, but nobody seemed to know where.  Probably the talk began when a shepherd went to Messrs Bunce & Thomson’s, merchants in Rundle St and told him he knew of a valuable mining district and would tell him of it for a reasonable consideration.  Mr Bunce took the offer, paid the money and received the information.  He engaged a Mr Fink to check out the site.
