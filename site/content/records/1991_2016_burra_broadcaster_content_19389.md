The Telstra mobile phone tower became operational at c. 4.30 p.m. Tuesday 29 June.  It was in November 1997 that Telstra confirmed it would build the tower on land leased from BCS on Brewery Hill â€“ then came consultation with the community, planning and heritage approval.  In April 1998 Telstra said it would cover 99% of the town, but one or two dead spots were possible.  In October 1998 the Council and the school both expressed concern over the delays, when the application at that time was with Environment Australia in Canberra.  Eventually there was news that the project would start in early 1999.  It was still mid-April before a group braved the strong wind on the site to hear that work would begin immediately.  Other towers have been built at Black Springs and Hallett.
