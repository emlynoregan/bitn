Obituary.  Mr Francis (Francie) J.A. Bernhardt died in Adelaide on 2 February after a short illness.  He was well known in Burra, having lived in Aberdeen until ten years ago.  He was the third son of the late Mr & Mrs F. Bernhardt of Aberdeen and was born in Burra in 1891.  He was educated at the Burra School.  He was a man of fine physique who out of working hours devoted himself to sport and was for years one of Aberdeen’s foremost footballers and cricketers, being noted for the true sporting spirit in which he ‘played the game’.  He married Miss Ivy Pearce of Mt Bryan and after his marriage settled in Aberdeen until going to Adelaide ten years ago where he had obtained a position with the Tramways Trust.  Three weeks prior to his death he caught a severe cold which led to bronchitis and finally to pneumonia, which caused his death.  He leaves a widow and family of seven children; the youngest only a few weeks old.  He also leaves two brothers and five sisters: F. Bernhardt (Swan Reach), R.G. Bernhardt (Aberdeen), Mrs T. Hirschausen (Adelaide), A.S. Walker (Aberdeen), P. Nolan (Adelaide), H. Evans (Pt Pirie) & H. Allen (Aberdeen).  [Francis John Andrew Bernhardt born 28 November 1890 Millerton (Burra): died 2 February 1935 Adelaide, residence Ovingham.]
