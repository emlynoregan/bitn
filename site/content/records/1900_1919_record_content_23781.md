Leighton Hall.  The committee has let the contract for the mason work to Mr Faulkner who has recently arrived from Broken Hill, but is a resident of Clare.  A. McDonald has the roofing contract.  There will be no foundation stone ceremony, but when the hall is completed, probably by the end of May, there will be a large demonstration at the opening.
