Jennison’s Tyre Service will cease trading on 15 May.  The Jennison family connection with Burra’s automotive businesses stretches back to 1922 when Ray’s father, Horton Jennison was the BMC dealer.  In 1956 Ray returned to Burra from Adelaide and the Jennisons then applied for the Ford dealership.  The wool industry was booming and branching into the automotive business in Burra was timely.  Horton Jennison died in 1967.  In the early days of the business it operated from the section of the building adjacent to Pearce’s Buildings.  The rest of the building was purchased from the late Glen Finch in 1960.  Later the firm bought the Eastern Telegraph [actually Telephone] Exchange on the south side of Commercial Street, which many will recall had housed the Air Force Clubrooms on the top floor.  This building was demolished to make way for the car yard.  The remaining business area on the south side as we know it today was purchased from H.C. Davies in 1958 and from C.J. Pearce & Son in 1966.  In 1978 the Toyota dealership was added.  Disaster struck in August 1985 when fire destroyed the section of building closest to Pearce’s Buildings.  This was rebuilt.  Ray Jennison is the third longest serving Ford dealer principal in SA.  He was a member of the Ford National Dealer Council for some 13 years.  In 1964 Jennison’s began business in Clare and leased that business from 1969-72.  Between 1972 and 1978 he again operated it, until selling to Clare Valley Motors.  Ray has also had an active involvement in the community.  His retirement closes a long chapter in Burra’s Commercial history.  From 19 May Neal Webster and Andrew Nourse, currently on the staff of Jennison’s Tyre Service, will begin business as Burra auto Repairs and will operate as authorised Ford Part & Warranty outlet from an entrance off Kangaroo Street.  The rest of the premises on the south side of Commercial Street will be leased to Elders Pastoral.
