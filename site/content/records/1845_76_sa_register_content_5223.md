Public Meeting at Kooringa on the New Constitution

The appointed day for the meeting to discuss the new constitution at Kooringa was Monday 11 November.  In honour of the occasion flags fluttered over the principal stores and larger shops, some of which were decorated with evergreens; especially the emporium of Marks and Gollin.  Business seemed to continue unabated and the Mine and Smelting Works were operating as usual.

At 3 p.m. crowds assembled at the Burra Hotel until it was ‘necessary to adjourn to the pile of buildings recently added to that extensive structure, and known as the “Oddfellows’ Hall and Kooringa Assembly-room,” a splendid apartment (the second in the colony), fifty-eight feet long, thirty-one feet wide, and eighteen feet high, lighted from each side and one end by well-proportioned windows.  There were upwards of two hundred persons present.’
