Burra Town Council, 16 January.

Report of W.T. Rabbich, Mayor. [Quoted as reprinted in the paper.]

[Words in italics were in italics originally and are as then printed.]

Gentlemen as a corporate body we are here at the instance of the confidence of the Ratepayers of this town and I am jealous of maintaining the honour and dignity of our position, when I read such unfair representations in the local press of our procedure in this Council.  In the first place I wish to state that the report of our last meeting, as published in the Record of 11 January, was anything but a fair and impartial one, and the comments thereon as contained in the subleader of the same paper were a garbeled statement, and some of the remarks was false.  In my report to you on that occasion I purposely made mention of several things re the action of the waterworks committee to expidite matters in getting the breakage of the machinary mended, that the ratepayers might see the committee were alive to their duties, but not a word was published for their information.  A queston that was asked by Cr Hardy, no doubt because it had refference to matter published in the Record with comments thereon that were farfetchd, before the Council had seen it was made a big thing of by the Editor Cr Hardies Report as Chairman of Public Works, in which several matters of importance were reffered to was barely made mention of, besides which a good deal of the business transacted that night was not mentioned at all, Among other things mentioned in the subleader the writer says, ‘To get the water laid on again as soon as as possible, an extra man was engaged, to assist the engineer, and at the last meeting of the Council councillor “Hardy & Kitchener considered it just and fair that Mr Littlejohn should pay for the extra labour’  Such a statement as contained in the latter part of the above paragraph is false, The Councillors mentioned made no such requist, In the sub-leader the writer says ‘We are supprised at the stand the Mayor took with Cr Linkson, who was notallowed to speak because there was no motion before the chair; I would only mention here that such is consistent with the standing orders, He futher goes on to say ‘His Worship probably forget that he allowed other councillors to speak two or three times previously when then there was no motion before the chair.  I must say in answer the writer, did not know what he was writeing about, or he would never have written and had published such a statement,  For the councillors speaking  previous to Cr Linkson being ruled out of order, were perfectly in order, and were in turn speaking to the queston occupying the attention of the Council, which queston was our agreement with the engineer, which was read for consideration at the instance of the Council, the minute Book of the corporation will prove such, Cr Linkson in then speaking, and imputing actions to the Council re their doings in getting the breakage at the works mended, which he afterward said when moving the Council be censured and which was foreign to the queston then being considered, was accordingly ruled out of order  In his subleader the writer futher says ‘Of course this naturally annoyed Cr Linkson and he left the room when Cr Hardys motion was brought forward  It was not likely he was going to vote for or against a motion, when he was not, allowed to give his opinion on it.’  The last sentence is a silly and untrue statement  Councillor Linkson never attempted to speak to Cr Hardys, motion off course if he did it was is prevellige to do so and I could not have stoped him from speaking, nor would I have attempted to , as long as he kept to the queston.  Among other things written and published in the same paper, certain advice is tendered to me re the studying of standing orders.  Well Gentlemen it is always with pleasure that I accept advice, from those competent to give it, but from one whose IGNORANCE or incapacity for impartiallity the one or the other, as instanced in subleader in queston his presumptuous action, I shall treat with the contempt it deserves.  I am here gentlemen, and I trust with yourselves having no objection to our actions as public men being fairly and squarly represented,  If our actions in this chamber at any time are not consistent with that of Gentlemen, then we should not object to have them as such represented, But I shall certanly object to being falsely represented as in the last onstance of publishing the doings of this Council, and thereby wrongly held up to redicule merely to satisfy the spleen of the Editor of the Burra Record Gentlemen I am very sorry to have to make such a report. The truth of which I challange contradiction.  The Minute book containing the result of our doings on the night in queston, which buisness  as I have above stated was not published, will suffice to show I think any reasonable person that our actions were not as represented in the Burra Record of Jan 11

W.T. RABBICH    MAYOR

[Important Note: as published, the footnotes appeared as interpolations in the text which interrupted the fine flow of the original.  Considering the nature of the comments it is surprising that the editor appears to have been inconsistent in his use of square and round brackets to distinguish his interpolations from the text of the Mayor.]

[The detailed report of the Council proceedings reveals a rather chaotic meeting with a confusion of topics and apparently no very coherent chairmanship.]

Cr Parks moved that the town assessment for 1893 be adopted as the waterworks assessment for 1893 with such additions or alterations as may be required and that the water rate be the same as that of last year.  (i.e. 3/- per 1,000 gallons up to the amount paid in rates and consumption in excess of the rating power be at 2/6 per 1,000 gallons.)

With respect to the Waterworks Cr Hardy moved: ‘That the three days extra labour be not paid by the Council’.

The Town Clerk pointed out that the last meeting of Council had passed payment to Mr Bartle.  After some heated exchanges Cr Hardy then moved: ‘That the account stand over till next meeting.’  The Mayor refused to take the motion.  Cr Kitchen tried to 2nd.

Cr Linkson then said that not being allowed to speak at the last meeting, he would do so now.  During the time of the accident the engineer worked 20 hours and then the next day worked 16 hours.  He always works 12, 14 and 16 hour days when a breakage occurs and to ask him to pay for extra labour is monstrous.  If the meters did not require reading at that particular time no extra labour would have been needed.

Cr Parks agreed, saying Bartle’s account is correct and the Council should pay it.  When the question was put it was supported by Hardy and Kitchen and against were Walsh, Linkson, West and Parks.

[It is hard to follow this given that the Mayor had not accepted the motion, which in any case would seem to require that an earlier motion be rescinded.]

Cr Hardy then threatened to call a meeting of ratepayers.

[The editor of the paper commented: ‘What rot!]
