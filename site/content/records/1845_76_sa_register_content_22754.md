Editorial on Engineering works in progress.  Many of the public works authorised three years ago will be viewed with very different feelings from those of their originators.

One of the new lines has already been placed on trial and several others are nearly fit for inauguration.  Mr Mais has taken pains to supply the public with information about the expenditure upon them.  [A section of the article then deals with the Strathalbyn-Middleton Railway and another with the line from Pt Wakefield.]

The Roseworthy-Forresters Line, though a mile longer (24½ miles) than the Port Wakefield line was intended to be, has been constructed in little more than half the time.  By the end of 1868 it was operational from Roseworthy to the Light.  This comprised 12½ miles of main line and two miles of sidings.  The piers and timber staging to cross the Light had been completed and the girders were delivered in December from the Cremlin Works of Kinnaird Brothers in Monmouthshire.  The foundation stone of the bridge was laid in July 1868 by Mrs Hamley, whose name it bears.  The last contract connected with it expired on the 1 March 1869.  The line ought to be very nearly ready for a visit from His Excellency and the Commissioner of Public Works.  The station buildings have been designed with an eye to economy.  There will be two of Stephenson’s 10-ton outside-cylinder engines, two composite carriages for passengers and twenty goods trucks.  Mr Mais reports the completion of the works will be for a sum slightly within estimates.

The Northern Extension Railway had been only twelve months in hand at the date of this report.  The line has been divided into four sections: No. 1 from Forresters north for 7½ miles, No. 2 the next 14 miles, No. 3 the next 14 miles and No. 4 the next 13½ miles.  This brings the line within 1½ miles of Burra and the final section will be allocated once the site of the terminus has been determined.  Tenders have been let for the earthworks, masonry, ballasting and fencing of these sections.  At the end of the year the first section was ready for plate-laying, the second was within four months of the expiry of the contract time and the other two were advancing rapidly.  The 25 iron bridges have been ordered from England and advice has been received of their shipment.  They comprise twelve 20 ft spans, ten 30 ft spans and three 60 ft spans.  The locomotives are expected in July and the wagon frames have been ordered.  They will be fitted out at the railway carriage works.  The rolling stock has been designed for lightness.  Mr Mais has no great faith in the carrying capacity of 40 lb rail, which had to be adopted throughout.  [The editorial then goes on to discuss other lines.]
