Burra Visitor Information Centre

The Centre appears to be back on track after some weeks of uncertainty.  It is running within its budget and visitor numbers for April and May have been very encouraging.  Financial assistance has been obtained from the Goyder Council and from a very generous donation from local identity Mr Les Warnes.  BRTBA President Peter Edson expressed the committee’s gratitude for Mr Warne’s generosity.  Helped by mild weather and a five-day Easter holiday, the visitor numbers ‘for April rise 115%’ compared with 2010.  [Does this mean an increase of 115% - more than doubling last year’s, or is the 2011 figure 115% of the 2010 figure?  The latter seems more likely since in May 3008 were served compared with 2506 in 2010 – which would give a figure of 120% or an increase of 20%.]
