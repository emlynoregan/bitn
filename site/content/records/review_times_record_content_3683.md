KESAB Awards

Burra won two certificates in the 1986 awards announced last week.  [The report does not make it quite clear in which categories the awards were won, but it appears they went to the Burra Senior Citizens’ Club for special Jubilee 150 projects and for heritage work.

The Mt Bryan Primary School won a special school award for its tidy town’s entry.
