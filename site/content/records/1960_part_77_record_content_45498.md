Obituary.  Stella Floyd Hawker died suddenly on 15 April at the home of her brother Cuthbert Ford Featherstonhough at Hamilton, Victoria.  She was buried at Bungaree Church, Clare after a service at St Andrew’s, Mt Bryan.  She was born at Albany, WA on 19 February 1898, the eldest child of Mr & Mrs Percy Featherstonhough and she married George Stanley Hawker of Clare 21 October 1931 and resided in that district till February 1935 when Mr & Mrs Hawker made their home at ‘Belcunda’ Mt Bryan, where they resided till her death.  Mrs Hawker took an active part in community affairs at Mt Bryan and Burra.  She was a Director of East Bungaree Stud and kept the books and managed the stud for nine months while Mr Hawker was in camp.  During WW II she was leader and organiser of the Mt Bryan VSD.  She was made a Life Member of the Burra Women’s Branch of the LCL on 5 July 1963 for services to it, having retired as President of the branch in 1959 after years in that post.  She was a member of the Council from 1947-60.  Mrs Hawker was the foundation President of Mt Bryan CWA branch when it was formed after WW II.  She had also put in years of service for the Red Cross during the war.  She had earlier been active in the Burra CWA branch and many CWA garden parties were held at her home over the years.  Although she had no children of her own, she took an interest in the M & BHA.  She was a keen supporter of the Burra Show and exhibited in the Floral and Vegetable Sections.  She was responsible for many improvements to the two churches where she worshipped, most recently for the steps up the embankment from the street [at St Mary’s].  The Sanctuary Light and Litch [sic] gate [lych-gate] at Mt Bryan were the brain children of Mrs Hawker.  She believed strongly in improving the district one lived in.
