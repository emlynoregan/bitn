‘Police Protection’ writes taking up the theme of lack of police in the town, especially given that the policeman at Redruth is also Clerk of the Court.  This inconveniently closes the court when he is called away.  Police are also forced to collect various statistics and to deal with areas beyond the town.  One is not enough, especially when so many strangers are about.
