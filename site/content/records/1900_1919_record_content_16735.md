‘Shareholder’ writes re the Burra Mine

He was glad to see the paper reminding the directors of their duty.  The Government lent a diamond drill on the understanding that if anything was found the company would work the mine.  In each of two bores sulphide ore was discovered, but nothing followed.  Then a pumping plant was offered from Sliding Rock if directors would promise to do their bit, but again there was no result.

Now there is a pumping plant being erected, but still no plant to treat ore.  With copper at £80 a ton and up-to-date machinery and the costs of carriage for coal so much less than when the mine was operating something should be possible.
