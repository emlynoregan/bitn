Burra Burra Show Inc.

A tree planting program will be introduced as an on-going project.

Sir Philip McBride will open the 1953 Show.

The grain and fodder section has been changed and the swine section dropped due to lack of interest.

Fred. M. Pearce & Sons will build new pigeon coops for £92-10-0.  This will accommodate 126 birds – still only enough for about half the entries received last year, when there were 600 entries.

F.N. Fabian resigned on leaving the district and was replaced as Secretary by H.L. Foote.

It was decided to run a special railcar from Adelaide and to hold a dance on show night in the Show Hall.
