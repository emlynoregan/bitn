Craig Wissell of Elder’s Burra has instigated a new series of grain trials to get a good look at new varieties in comparison with those presently grown.  The trials will be repeated four times on John Tiver’s property just north of Burra.  They will look at eight varieties of wheat, six of barley, ten of oil seed and fifteen varieties of grain legumes.
