"The Man Who Sees" responds to the letter of "Peace Be With You".

[He is mainly concerned with the lack of Christian faith and believing that if "Peace Be With You" could train his mind he would â€˜certainly share in fullness of the Spirit, and become a real service to the Community in which you live.]
