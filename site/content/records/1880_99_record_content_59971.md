Burra Town Council, 12 May.

It was decided after all not to lease the Best Place Reserve.  [Page 3 reveals the reason was that the young trees were not yet beyond the reach of stock.]

A query re water use at the police station was disallowed and no reduction in the charge will be allowed.

Other routine matters were dealt with.
