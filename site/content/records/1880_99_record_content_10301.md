‘One who has worked both in broad cloth and moleskin’ writes to condemn the drivel of R.W.M. who comes forward to ‘oppose the march of civilization and educational progress.’  R.W.M.’s outpourings are ‘a vast amount of platitude and weak assertion’.  Education can give the poor power and influence and enable workers to get representatives from their own ranks to sit in Parliament.  The education of the people will lead to the regeneration of our whole political and social fabric.  The advice of R.W.M. to avoid the disappointment of clerkships is sensible, given the overstocking of this group, but it is equally applicable ‘to the children of the “respectable” or “shabby genteel” class as to those of the working men.’

Let R.W.M. turn his advice to the poorly paid clerk who scarce earns enough to survive and yet who prefers to labour for such mean rewards than turn to better pay as a crossing sweeper - all the time claiming that manual labour is honourable - though not for them.  Education will allow a sorting out of jobs for which ability is required, whether the person be aristocrat or democrat.  The working class of Burra must not be misled by such casuistry.  They should demand as education not merely in the 3 R’s, but one that will enable them to fill creditably the highest positions in the colony.

[The writer also regrets that others have not responded to R.W.M.’s stuff.]

[Though anonymous, this piece has the feel of W.H. Hardy about it.  Hardy did feel though, that the education actually being provided was designed to keep the lower orders ‘in their place’ and was opposed to technical education because it would continue to keep the poor at the bottom of the social ladder.]
