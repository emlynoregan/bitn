Inquest/Obituary.  An inquest was held at Kooringa on 26 December before W. Lang Esq. on the body of John Smith, a seaman aged 24.  From the evidence the deceased went to the house of a German named Karrall at the Burra Burra and asked for a light for his pipe.  This was given him.  He went away, but then returned asking for another light and offering to pay for it.  He got a second light, but some words occurred between him and Karrall.  The deceased then said he would burn down the house and he put a candle up to the roof.  Karrall’s wife tried to snatch the candle and it fell to the ground.  Karrall then asked Smith to go.  Smith did not, and some sort of quarrel ensued in which Karrall struck Smith on the head with a stool, before going inside and closing the door.  Smith then broke in the door and began throwing stone and staves from a cask into the house.  Karrall then went out and struck Smith on the back of the head with an axe, causing him to bleed.  Smith then went away a short distance, as far as the corner of Mr James’s store, where he met some men, but said nothing of significance to them.  They saw Smith return to Karrall’s house and burst open the door.  Karrall then came out and struck Smith on the top of the head with the edge of the axe, literally burying it in his head, the skull being completely cut in two and the heel of the axe coming into contact with the brain.  Dr Bull was quickly on the scene and the deceased was then gasping his last breaths.  He was removed to Wren’s Burra Burra Hotel, where he was found to be dead.  The jury found a verdict against Karrall for the wilful murder of John Smith and he was accordingly committed for trial.  [John Smith died 25 December 1849.  The German’s name was Gottlieb Kiernall.]

[This death resulted in the ‘murder tombstone’ in the Burra Cemetery:]

The wording reads:
