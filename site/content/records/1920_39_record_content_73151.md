Accident.  J.W. Mannion was working on their property at Clifden Carrieton when his horse fell and rolled on him, breaking his hip, tearing ligaments and fracturing his pelvis.  In two hours he managed to crawl half a mile to a road, but no traffic passed.  He then managed to get his dog to go home with a note.  His brother and wife arrived about an hour later.  He crawled into the car, as they were unable to lift him and was eventually driven 50 miles to Orroroo Hospital where he has spent six weeks.
