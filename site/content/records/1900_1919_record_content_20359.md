Editorial on The New Tariff.

The new tariff was discussed at a Public meeting at the institute on Friday.  It was not as largely attended as it should have been.  The tax on all imported articles will increase the cost of living 3/- to 5/- a week and in many cases more.  Why is this increase in Government income necessary?  To pay the Parliamentary salaries.

[This column of condemnation is not, on the whole, well argued, being vague, generalised, and lacking in carefully argued logic.]
