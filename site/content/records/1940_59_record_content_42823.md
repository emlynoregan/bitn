Burra Hospital Board.  E. Finch Chairman.  The hospital has been in need of Sisters and trainees and a permanent laundress.  For several weeks the Matron has dealt with a large quantity of laundry before commencing nursing duties.  The Board is very concerned about costs, especially in view of recent wage rises and it may be necessary to increase patientsâ€™ fees.
