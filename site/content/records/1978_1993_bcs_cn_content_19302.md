Recruiting rallies were held in the Burra Institute, usually on Fridays when shops were asked to close early at 8 p.m.

Rationing was imposed and petrol rationing was a real problem.

Burra Clothing Factory opened in October 1944 [in the present Goyder Council Office] making uniforms for troops.  Girls earned from 20 shillings to 75 shillings a week depending on experience and age.

Trenches and air raid shelters were constructed at Burra School in March 1942 by a working bee of 150 men.

Burra Civil Defence League organised a round the clock watch on the skies for enemy planes.  [From the Record photographic Studio.’

By 1945 Burra Branch of the Red Cross was one of the largest country branches.

By 1944 the FFCF 109 had raised over £1,000 for the war effort.

Burra Show was cancelled in 1940 and the Committee directed its efforts to war work.  They raised £1,000 towards the purchase of two ambulances.  (Each cost about £600.)

In June 1940 the Red Cross Ambulance Fund opened an appeal for funds and by August had sent £500 to Adelaide.

The Red Cross also held an Ugly Man Contest in 1940, which raised £140-1-5.

By 1943 Mr W. Woodman had knitted 39 cardigans for troops, outdoing most of the women.

The FFCF sent Christmas hampers to troops.  Costing 7/6 each, they contained a fruit cake, pudding, tobacco and papers, toothpaste, toothbrush, razor blades, condensed cream, preserved fruit and a handkerchief.

The FFCF knitted over 800 pairs of socks for troops in WWII.

Marj Edmonds & Jan Davis have established a fund to place a seat along the creek in memory of Artley Josephs.

Burra Hospital Ladies’ Auxiliary has raised almost $4,000 this year to date by catering efforts – with more to come.

Jan Jacka & David Jennings have received Associate Honours at the AGM of the Royal Life Saving Society in Adelaide, in appreciation of work carried out during the year.

Pauline Van Der Does advises that due to unforseen circumstances, she has been forced to give up her window cleaning service.

Burra Creek.  Planned works will begin shortly.  They include a reservoir for the oval watering system, construction of a sluice gate in the weir to allow the upper pond to be drained for cleaning and stabilisation of downstream banks.  It is expected the works will be completed and the creek flowing again before Christmas.
