Burra Town Council, 19 February

J.G. Tiddy & A.W. Bevan have agreed to hand over the private road 20 ft wide from the parklands boundary to the Smelting Works to make an outlet from the present road as the property is to be cut up into building blocks.  Accepted.

The inspection of the town revealed much work was required, especially in North Ward where roads were in an appalling state.

Morehead St was the worst in Burra with not a chain of kerbing.  Much of the trouble in the ward came from not kerbing the channels.

A special meeting to discuss this was called for 26February.
