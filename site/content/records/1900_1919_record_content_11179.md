Mr Richard Field is living in retired comfort at ‘Monavea’ four miles west of Burra.  Mr & Mrs Field came to SA on 15 November 1855 in the Victoria Regia and went to live first at Islington.  Twelve months later they came to Burra where Mr Field worked for the English & Australian Copper Co.  In 1859 he moved to Hamilton, Victoria where he took and worked land for four years.  In late 1863 he returned to Burra and again worked for a time with E. & A. Copper co. before working at the Burra Mine.  In 1868 he took land in the Hd of Hanson now known as ‘Monavea’ and has been there ever since.  He enjoyed a succession of good seasons.  There are five sons and one daughter: G.A.
