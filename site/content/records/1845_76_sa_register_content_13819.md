Kooringa News, 5 December

On Monday evening Rev. Whittaker delivered an address at the Institute on the subject of ‘Calico Printing and its Machinery’.  The lecture was illustrated with diagrams and models executed by himself.  The next lecture will be by Rev. Ibbetson on the topic of ‘Railways’.  We should also note the contribution to the enjoyment of these evenings made by the musicians Messrs Fellowes, Jordan, Dennis and Andrews.

A considerable number of people gathered at the racecourse yesterday for a match arranged between C.W. Ware’s Spiderlegs and J. Edward’s Punch.  Punch won easily after an even competition in the first part of the race.  Two hurry-skurries were then got up and won by horses owned by F. Cowper and George Bennet.
