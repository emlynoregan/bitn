[A list of scholars is provided.]  They paid 6d a week.  At 9½ he left to become a whim boy at the mine, but when it closed in 1866 he returned to school, this time to that of Mr Charles Bennett in Redruth.  The old Bible Christian Chapel at Hampton was a well-built stone church.  Rev. Allen was the minister.  He goes on to talk of the Hampton Bible Christian Sunday School.  There were three Hampton quarries.  Watkins was the chief one and supplied most of the building stone.  Tivers and Rogers were others.  They produced good building stone too that Tom Rabbich carted to Kooringa.  Most residents in Hampton built their own homes.  Rents were low – a three-roomed house cost 2/6 a week.  Mrs Rogers had the only store, which supplied all household requirements.  There was an almond tree I planted when 10 in my father’s garden.  I think it is still living.  Mr Lomman now owns the property.  He then goes on to talk about the mine closure.  [But note that he gives the wrong date for it.]
