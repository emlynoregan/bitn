Burra Burra DC

Up to six streets in Burra and Burra North will be sealed during March.

A $1,600 grant has been made to assist in repair of damage done to the Burra-Andrews Road in last Octoberâ€™s floods.

Council has agreed to relocate the old gun from the Mine Entrance to a point near their new complex at Burra North.

Vandalism at the swimming pool in the past month or so has caused great inconvenience and expense.

There is a move for parts of the Hundreds of Kingston and Ayers to secede from Burra and join the Hallett Council.  Council is most concerned about this and has asked in a circular that ratepayers think carefully about this subject.
