Mr Forder started work as a solicitor’s clerk in his father’s office.  In 1852 he came to SA and moved to Burra.  Most men were then in Victoria on the goldfields and gold flowed in.  Often one heard that Mrs So-and-so had ½ lb gold sent her.  Little change was in circulation so tradesmen gave change in IOUs.  Mr Forder then went to the diggings for three years and on return took a farm at Clare for a while, but it failed.  On returning to Burra he opened a public school and when the Redruth School was built he accepted a post there as headmaster.  In 1860 he was appointed Clerk of the Redruth Court and held the position for 40 years all but 3 months.  In 1870 he was appointed returning officer in which position he has been singularly successful and popular.  Even when results were as close as 7 or 2 no recount has been asked for.
