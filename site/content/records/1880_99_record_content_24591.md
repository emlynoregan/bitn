Unemployment Relief.   A letter from one who is out of work in response to criticisms that men failed to take passes to Hergott Springs.  There was, he said, too little time for preparation, and the men did not know the conditions and if it was as they feared for 4/6 a day in back-breaking labour in 120°F heat, then 4/6 a day would not support their families so why should they go?  And if the Govt. can guarantee piecework for 8/- a day then they should say so and many would go.  We need a new Govt.
