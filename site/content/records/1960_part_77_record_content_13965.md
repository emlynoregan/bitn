Burra Town Council, 5 November

A further letter is to be sent to the Attorney General about the closing of [old section of] the cemetery, saying the previous reply did not clarify matters and they require some definite direction.

Permission was granted for R.D. Riggs to demolish an old building.

45°parking lanes are to be marked from the ANZ Bank to the Catholic Church and from the corner of Thames Street to the corner of Queen Street, in front of the Burra Hotel and in the parking bay of the RSL Hall.  A prohibited area is to be declared on west side of Market Street 60 ft from lots 82 & 83 [Cold Stores – in 2010 the Butcher’s] and south for 12 ft except for the doctor living adjacent.
