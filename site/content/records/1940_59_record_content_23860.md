The Back to School Celebrations

On Tuesday morning these celebrations drew a very large attendance.  Many visitors dressed in school attire of former days.  They congregated in the school yard and played games and quarrelled in the best traditional spirit.  Later they formed a line and marched into school.  Lessons were abandoned as they proved too unruly to teach.  A morning tea was served in the assembly room by members of the Parents and Friends’ Association.

Present Head Teacher of the Primary School, Mr T. Rice addressed the gathering and the Head teacher of the High School Mr Pederick thanked the people for their attendance.  All visitors were asked to sign the Visitors’ Book as a record of historical interest.
