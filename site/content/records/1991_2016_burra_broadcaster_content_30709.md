Burra Theatre Group is working on its production ‘The Girls of Hampton Court’.  Robyn Day is presently taking the role of Matron, while looking for a replacement.  Robyn wrote the play about the Girls’ Reformatory at Redruth, set between 1897 and 1922.  Robyn says the girls’ stories ranged from tragic to very amusing and the play will be presented sometime in September and there will also be grant applications with a view to shooting a movie.
