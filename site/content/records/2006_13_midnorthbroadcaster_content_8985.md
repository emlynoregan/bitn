The Bush to Burra Cattle Drive is pleased to have again been able to raise a significant sum for a variety of health services in the Mid North.  On Wednesday 30 September the drive started with a social gathering around the campfire at Gum Creek before the start the next morning.  MC Geoff Schell outlined the next dayâ€™s activities.  Day one started out fine, but soon turned into a very wet day and night.  Each day they travelled about 12 km.  The food provided by a variety of community groups along the way was a highlight of the event.  Visiting musicians entertained the group each night around a campfire.  By day five the weather had become ideal for the finish at Old Canowie.
