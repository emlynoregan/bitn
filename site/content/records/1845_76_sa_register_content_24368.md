Ulooloo Diggings.  A Wesleyan Chapel was opened at Ulooloo on Sunday 31 December 1871 when Rev. Leggoe from Fiji preached twice to large congregations.  A public meeting the next day drew a large gathering and raised £36.  This, with previous subscriptions brings the total raised to £127.  The chapel with furnishings has cost about £239 exclusive of the harmonium, which is the result of the efforts of the Misses Hiles.
