Westinghouse Brake Trials.  This was tested last Friday between Petersburg and Jamestown on the narrow gauge line.  A large party to witness the trial came from Adelaide by special train and a reporter from the Record joined them at Burra.  The conditions for the trial are spelled out.  Other competitors were called for, but only the Westinghouse system was tested.
