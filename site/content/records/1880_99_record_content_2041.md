Burra Town Council, 25 October

The Mayor reported that after the last meeting he had been grossly insulted by Constable Coleman when calling attention to the larrikinism in Kooringa the previous Saturday night and Monday morning.  Corporal Phelan was present at the time and could corroborate.  The Mayor felt the Council should have the matter investigated.  Cr Ridgway thought the Mayor should have reported it to the Inspector of Police at once.  The Council could take up the matter of larrikinism and draw the attention of the Inspector to it.  Cr Lewis thought that the insult to the Mayor could be taken up by Council.  Cr Richardson would support a report re the insult to the Mayor, but he did not support one condemning the constable’s work re larrikinism.  The constable could not be everywhere at once, nor out seeking the culprits all the time.  Eventually it was resolved that the Council would call the disturbances of the evening of October 9/10 to the attention of the Inspector and that the Mayor would report what he had suffered.

Messrs H. Dawson, W.H. Rosman, T. Nicholls, & Mrs Builder comprised a deputation re the levels of the footpath in Commercial St.  The Council then adjourned till Friday to give themselves time to investigate the matter.
