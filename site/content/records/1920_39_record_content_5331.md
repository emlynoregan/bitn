Obituary.  Thomas Wilks, father of Edward Stewart Wilks, died at Mt Bryan East 19 September aged 81.

He was born in November 1839 in Swansea, Wales and came to SA with his parents when he was 10.  The family lived first at Hampton.  His father died when Thomas was a young man and he had to assume responsibility for the family.  He was then engaged in butchering.  About 1875 he took up land at Mt Bryan East as a farmer and grazier.  For many years he was a member of the Hallett DC and was a staunch supporter of the Liberal Union and of the Mt Bryan East Methodist Church.

His first wife was Miss S. Stewart, daughter of the Late Alex Stewart of Aberdeen.

His second wife was Mrs Nicholls, late of Gumeracha.

His third wife was Miss C. Hosking, late of Kooringa.

His last wife died last January and he leaves an only son Mr Edward Stewart Wilks.  Mr Elias Wilks of Kooringa is a brother.
