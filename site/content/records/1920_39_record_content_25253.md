Characteristics of the 1927 paper.

Page 1.

Large advertisements dominate: mostly local.

From 16 November some news items appear among the advertisements.

Page 2

Large local advertisements dominated by stock and other sales.  Public notices and some smaller classified advertisements, though generally the pattern of page 2 extends for a column or two on page 3 and smaller items are generally found there.

Page 3

Once past the overflow of page 2 material, solid news occupies most of the space with a couple of larger advertisements.  There are no editorials.  Sport takes a large part, but the activities of the town are generally well covered.  The Town Council gets good coverage.

Page 4

Larger advertisements dominate, especially for motor cars and radios, but others as well.  A fluctuating, but significant amount of news is also found here.  This may commonly run up to three columns and occasionally more.

Supplements.

In the first half of the year these were occasional, but from June they are common and from August it is unusual not to have one.  They vary in size, often being about 70% the size of the paper and sometimes they are single-sided.

Overall the paper continues to give a good coverage of local news and reports closely enough on items being debated to give the tone of the discussion and a sense of the personalities involved.
