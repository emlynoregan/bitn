Wednesday 19 June, page 3

Burra Burra Oddfellows Lodge with upwards of 200 members is trying to establish a library to fulfil a need in Kooringa.  The library will operate in connection with the lodge, but will be open to the public upon payment of an increased subscription.  It is surprising that a town of 5,000 people does not have this means of intellectual amusement.  It is to be hoped that as well as a library, a savings bank will soon be established there, as there can be no doubt that with a bank much money now squandered in waste and extravagance would be saved.
