This rain damaged wheat crops, where some grain gas shot in the heat.  Some bagged wheat has also shot and will need to be re-bagged.  Considerable reaping is yet to be done and damage there is yet to be assessed.  From Burra to Saddleworth farmers report bleaching of wheat, with one bag in nine lost on account of weight.  In the pastoral country the rain was welcomed.  Some areas had not had significant rain for three or four years.  Falls to the 31 December: Oakbank 525 points, Pine Valley 411, Kia Ora 340, Poonunda 584, Oakvale 561, Woolgangi 480 and Koomooloo 402.  Practically all dams are full.
