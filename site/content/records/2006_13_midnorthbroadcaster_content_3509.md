Health Bill.  The draft Health Care Bill will see country hospital boards disappear, to be replaced by local health advisory councils, a move Country Health SA believes will ensure country community assets are retained locally.  Only one hospital board is still standing.  [This statement appears to be contradicted in the next paragraph.]

Once country hospital boards are dissolved Health Advisory Councils will be established as incorporated bodies.  As well as advising, advocating and fundraising for their local communities HACs will hold the local assets currently managed by incorporated hospitals.  A second model creates the Country Health Community Asset Authority (CHCAA), which would be the single asset holding body for all country hospitals, but the HACs would retain their other functions.
