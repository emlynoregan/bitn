Empire Day was celebrated at Burra Primary and High Schools on Friday last.  The ceremony included a broadcast from Adelaide by the Hon. S.W. Jeffries Minister of Education.  Mr Jennison chairman of the School Committee conducted the outdoors part of the ceremony after the broadcast: two minutes of silence were observed in tribute to the fallen in the 1914-18 war and those who have paid the supreme sacrifice in the present war.  He then recited the Ode and gave the children a half-holiday.  At the High School an address was given by the headmaster Mr Easson.
