The Burra Show was held on Saturday last and the pavilion exhibits were said to be the best for years.  The quality made up for any decrease in quantity.  There was rain before 9 a.m. and the day was overcast, but the day was perfect for the show.  Sideshows were numerous, but reported a bad day, probably there were too many of the same sort.  The Boxing Troupe of Major Wilson created a great deal of interest.

Cars, machinery and electrical goods were more numerous than last year.  Entries in some sections fell, but overall there was an increase: 2131 in 1953, 1978 in 1954 and 2300 in 1955.

Art had only 21 entries, but they were of good quality.  Mrs O. Ockenden took all first prizes, but one.

Bird and poultry increased to 723 entries.

In pigeons the majority of birds showed the effects of over-showing, but local classes were excellent, where the major winners were A.H. Broad and P.J. Byrnes.

In cookery there were 104 entries.  The Burra Show Prize for cake recipe went to Miss Avis Stockman and the aggregate trophy went to Mrs F.C. Stolte.

Flowers were again outstanding.  The main prize winners were Mrs M.N. Tiver, C.R. Simon, R. Harris, R. Fuss, East Bungaree Ltd, E.J. Verrall (Petherton), Mrs H.A. Edwards, M. George and E.E. Rooke.

For grain and fodder C.H. Behn won the aggregate trophy.

The main exhibitors in horses in action were W. Meyer, L.C. Stott, T. Williams, M. McWaters, H.B. Chapman and R. Dohnt.

Needlework entries were up by 30.  Mrs G.R. Finch won the aggregate prize for the CWA section and other main prize winners were Miss J. Ley, Mrs F.C. Stolte and O. Handke.

Sheep.  In the strong wool section the Koonoona Trophy went to Murray Thomas.

The Champion Strong Wool Merino Ewe was shown by R. McInnes & Sons.

The Open Class Medium Wool Trophy also went to Murray Thomas.

Champion Medium Wool Ram was shown by Murray Thomas, who also exhibited the Champion Ewe.

In the 1000 to 2000 Class the Aggregate Trophy went to R. McInnes & Sons.

Under 1000 Class Champions were exhibited by J.L. Edmonds.

Wool.  The Champion Fleece was entered by K.R. Phillips, who also won the open class for best fleece.

J.L. Riggs won the Hundreds Class.

Reg. Warnes won the Perpetual Lease Class Outside Hundreds.

The School Displays were impressive, with entries from Booborowie, Hanson, Mt Bryan, Gum Creek, Burra Primary and Burra High.

An excellent display was mounted by the Burra Rural Youth Club.  The Clare Youth Clubâ€™s float was a feature of the Grand Parade.

Sir Keith Angas, President of the Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society was introduced by President of the Burra Show Rex Warnes and declared the show open.  G. Stanley Hawker MP moved the vote of thanks.

The PMG Department has advised that owing to unfavourable circumstances they did not propose to move the Ludgvan Street letter receiver.  Another letter will be sent to them pointing out that a move of 45 yards to bring it nearer a light might generate more use.
