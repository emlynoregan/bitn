The Burra Broadcaster

This issue is the 100th since changing to the present format.  All in all the advertising medium put out by the Burra Community Print has seen 415 editions and editorial comment has been running for 112 editions.  The Broadcaster began when BCP moved to new premises in December 1990.  New computerised equipment and training of new staff enabled the Broadcaster to be developed as an insert in the local school newsletter.

As the Broadcaster grew it became necessary to expand our format and we began to include substantially more editorial content.  Although the Broadcaster has not employed professional journalists, the input from local the community was steady.  Conflict over editorial content led to the Broadcaster becoming a separate entity and eventually BCP lost the printing of the School Community News to a Clare company.

Although this was a serious loss, it pushed the Broadcaster along at a quicker rate and resulted in a doubling of circulation and more profitable content.  We are currently building the infrastructure to support a bigger and better paper.
