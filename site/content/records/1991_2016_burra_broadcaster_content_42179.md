Burra’s Heritage Listed Paxton Square Cottages built in 1849, are to be upgraded and modernised, with the support of a $200,000 State Government Regional Development Fund Grant.

The whole $1.2 million project undertaken by the Goyder Council will underpin the Paxton Square Cottages as a boutique and contemporary accommodation complex.  The 32 cottage complex will be repurposed to a 3.5 star rated facility.  The Bible Christian Chapel will be adapted to a communal meeting place for guests.  The upgrade and rebranding will support greater tourism in the area and will provide a modern comfortable offering for tourists to the Clare valley tourism region.  It will support Burra’s initiative to become the ‘home of the boutique festival’.  The aim will also be to boost occupancy in the non-traditional tourism periods in Burra.
