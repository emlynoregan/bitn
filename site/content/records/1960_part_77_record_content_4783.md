Burra Town Council, 5 December

The condition of certain houses in Paxton Square was discussed and a conference with the trustees is to be arranged if possible.

The Mayor attended a farewell for Mr L.H. Thomas on 4 December.

Five street signs are to be obtained for each ward as a trial.

Aberdeen Croquet Club sought its usual subsidy on its water rate.  Council found it was responsible for the annual rate only.
