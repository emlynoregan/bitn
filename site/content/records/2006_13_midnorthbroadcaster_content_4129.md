Burra Girl Guides have a doubtful future with the possible closure of the Guide Hall in Burra.  Guide Leader Sharon O’Connor said she has yet to hear any news from the Board of Guides SA about such a decision.  What news she has had seems contradictory.  The Board has said its decision to close the hall was based on the cost the Board incurs for maintenance, but in fact maintenance finance has come from local fundraising.  Mrs O’Connor would like to know if anyone is interested in saving the hall because if no one cares she won’t bother fighting for it.  Burra Girl Guides went into recess for a year due to low numbers, but if the hall is closed Mrs O’Connor says she will not resume in 2008.  After 14 years as District Leader she needed a break.  If any parents would like their children to participate in Girl Guides they should contact Sharon O’Connor.  [Photo.]
