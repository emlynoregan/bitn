New Zealand Primary Producers visited Burra on Saturday, accompanied by President of the Burra Branch of the Stockowners’ Association, Mr Rex Warnes, Mr G.S. Hawker MP, District Clerk, Mr K.R. Crewes and members of the Stockowners’ association Council.  At Farrell Flat they inspected high quality 4 tooth ewes and saw the results of mulesing operations.  After lunch at Burra, they went to Booborowie, where some saw a stud of Ayrshires and Illawarra Shorthorns, while others witnessed their first game of Australian Rules Football.  At R. Hawker Ltd they inspected some beautiful rams and F. Willis’s Jersey herd.  Dinner was at the Kooringa Hotel, followed by a smoke social, given by the Mayor, the Stockowners’ association and the Chairman of the District Council, Mr E. Finch.  [The speeches at the social are reported at length.]

On Sunday afternoon most of the visitors were conducted over the old mine area by Mr H.J. Wilson, Overseer for the Burra Town Council.
