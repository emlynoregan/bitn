The National Trust of SA is 50 years old this year and part of the Burra Branchâ€™s celebrations will be the visit of the Redruth Town Crier from Cornwall.   Alan Jewell and his wife Lynda had a sneak preview when they visited Burra briefly on their way to the Kernewek Lowender.  After their visit to Burra on 17 May, the couple will fly to the UK on 18 May.
