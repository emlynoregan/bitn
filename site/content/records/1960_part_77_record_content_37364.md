The Tour of Burra organised by the Rector and Wardens of St Mary’s was a success and attracted many residents as well as visitors including Adelaide people and two New Zealanders.  Over 100 adults and children spent an interesting afternoon led by Mr Ian Auhl.  St Mary’s church was comfortably filled as others joined to see the films on Burra and to hear Mr Auhl’s address.  The Anglican Quartet rendered a motet.  Jan Cockington and Rosemary Reed played a duet and Rev. Sibly played an organ solo and accompanied hymn singing.
