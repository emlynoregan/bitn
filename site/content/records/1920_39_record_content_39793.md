Burra Electric Supply Co. Ltd held its annual meeting on Thursday at the Power House.  Revenue this year dropped sharply, but directors recommended a dividend of 5%.  Retiring directors W.H. Sandland & J.E. Pearce were re-elected.  This dividend is only the second of that amount in nine years so that the reward to investors has been just 11/9% p.a.  Most investors bought in to help the town rather than make money.  There are 75 shareholders at present with 8,551 shares.  46 live away from the town.  Some consumers complain at the cost of light, but if any have cause for complaint it is the original investors.
