Exhibitions and Fairs

Burra Arts Council annual art exhibition was held in the old Record Office as one of five art exhibitions on the same weekend.

This Art Experience Weekend also featured the S.T. Gill exhibition, The Allyson & Marie Parsons Burra and Beyond exhibition, The Regional Art Society’s showing at the former Bible Christian Chapel and the Russell Morrison collection in the Old Courthouse.

Pride of place in the Allyson Parson display was the magnificent painting commissioned by the Burra Burra DC to commemorate the town’s 150th anniversary.

The Morrison exhibition was supported by members of the Flute Society and the SA Police Choir.

The Antique and Decorating Fair was held in the Town Hall on the first weekend in May.

The Governor-General, Mr Bill Hayden visited Burra to unveil the restored S.T. Gill watercolours on view at Morphett’s Engine House in the Mine Museum and he awarded souvenir medallions to students at BCS.

Xavier Minniecon presented the ABC’s Weather Shots Exhibition at the Civic Centre in June.
