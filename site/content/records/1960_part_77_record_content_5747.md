Burra RSL held its AGM.  President Mr G.K. Kelly asked members to take a more active role in the club.  Elected: President, H. Cornelius; Vice-Presidents, T. Rogers & C.L. Phillips; Secretary, R.W. Nankivell & Treasurer, B. Kotz.

The year was uneventful.  Anzac Day Service was conducted by the Ministers’ Fraternal and preceded by a march led by the Pt Pirie Pipers’ Band.  There was a good muster of ex-servicemen.  Remembrance Day was also observed at the Memorial with a large attendance of school children.  The poor weather reduced attendance at the annual ball, but it was a social success.  Thanks are paid to the Ladies’ Auxiliary.  The annual dinner also had a small attendance.  The Christmas Party was a combined function with the Air Force Association.  Several successful badge days were held and the branch continues to support two Legacy wards.  Thanks are extended to the various officers who gave their time and effort during the year.
