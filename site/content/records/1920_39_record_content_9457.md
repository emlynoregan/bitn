Burra Town Council, Monday

The Mayor (Maurice Collins) commented on and regretted the rivalry between Aberdeen and Kooringa.

Metropolitan Fire Brigade desires the Fire Station be putty-plastered and a manhole be put in the ceiling, also a water tank and privy be erected.  They would then allow £20 p.a. rent instead of £18.

Cr Kellaway said there was an overdraft of £327 on the building and of the promised donations of £170 only £50 had been handed over.  Council agreed to the improvements suggested.
