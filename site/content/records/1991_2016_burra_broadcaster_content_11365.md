Burra art Gallery was officially opened on Saturday with an exhibition called ‘Family Collections and Connections’ drawn from the private collections of the Wilson and Bonython Families.  There were works by such famous names as Rembrandt, Holbein and Heysen.  The Chairman of the McDouall Stuart Board introduced Mr Kym Bonython who opened the gallery.  Curator Heather Parker explained how artists had interpreted the land as subject matter.  Of South Australian interest are two water colours of 1838 showing Walkerville by Frederick Nixon.  Also Edwin Barry’s two watercolours of survey camps at Belalie and Bundaleer Creek in 1868.
