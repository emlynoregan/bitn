Stockowners’ Association of SA.  The Burra Branch held its AGM last Friday in the LCL rooms.

The Chairman I.J. Warnes presided.  He was re-elected Chairman for the coming year.

A vote of appreciation for his 30 years of service was recorded.

The annual report revealed a very hard year for man and beast.  Farmers and graziers had been at their wits end to cope with the drought that was made worse by low prices for wheat and wool.

Mr Warnes reported on moves for the registration of earmarks and to get foxes declared vermin.

He was concerned too about higher award rates for shearing, but on the positive side reported 1 20% reduction in rail freight charges, though they were still too high.

Another matter was the licensing of trucks that would aid in detecting stock stealing.  They wanted Alsatian Dogs confined to the city or sterilised.

The main address by the General President Mr W.G. Hawkes is reported at length in c. 1¾ columns.
