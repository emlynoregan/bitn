A full page of advertisements announces the relocation of Goyder Auto Service to Best Place Burra North.  Toni Gisi has more than 35 yearsâ€™ experience servicing all makes of cars and more than 20 years servicing Mercedes Benz.  He began his apprenticeship working for his father, Vic Gisi, in the premises in Thames Street now La Pecora Nera.  He later went on to manage Goyder Auto Service located behind the Burra BP for almost 10 years.  A need for expansion prompted the purchase of a new site at Best Place in 2012 with partner Lisa Smedley.  After a month of wide ranging renovation the new workshop opened in early March 2013.  The changes included new cement flooring, roller doors and the installation of extensive security systems.  [Photo.]
