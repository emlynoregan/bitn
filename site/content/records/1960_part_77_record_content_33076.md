Old Burra Photographs

Mr R. Noye has sent to this office some photographs of Burra and the Burra Mine taken in 1905.  While rummaging through the old blacksmith’s shop in Riverton, belonging to Mr Scholz, he came across nearly 200 dry plates.  Mr Scholz had taken these photographs in 1905 and the plates were in excellent condition.  A number of them show Burra and the Mine.  Views include Graves’ Shaft, Johnny Green, Market Square, the treeless Burra Creek, the Open Cut, the Ballast Quarry and a general panorama of Kooringa.  This discovery followed a hint obtained by Mr Noye of their whereabouts.  He is making a collection as a keen photographer and researcher into early photography, for the Public Library of SA.  He would welcome any dry plates or old prints for copying.  Copies will be made available to the National Trust.
