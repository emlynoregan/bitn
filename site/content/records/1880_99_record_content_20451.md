The affair happened at Hoar’s Hotel, Petersburg about one week ago.  Deceased came to me and said he knew me and I was Flanigan.  Told him no.  He bet 5/- it was.  Flanigan then returned from the WC.  Flanigan grabbed deceased and asked him what he was pulling his name about for all afternoon.  Flanigan gave him a push and the deceased fell and when he got up said ‘You have broken my thumb.’  Then they both sat on a form in the bar.  Did not think either man drunk, though both had been drinking.  Did not think the deceased had been saying anything to warrant the attack by Flanigan - not in my presence at least.  Have not since seen the deceased.

Thomas Phillips corroborated the above.

William A. Jones, barman at Hoare’s Petersburg Hotel:

Spoke to deceased about 16th instant.  He showed me his finger and said Jack Flanigan did it.  Tied up his finger.  Tried to find Flanigan, but lost him down the street.  On the morning he came to Burra the deceased told me his hand was getting worse - about the 23rd - he said ‘I believe Mrs Brady has poisoned my hand.’  Sent him to Dr Florrance and he came back saying it was much better for being dressed.  I and another young man paid his fare to Hospital.  Did not know of the row and have never seen the deceased quarrelsome.  Did not see Flanigan and deceased in the bar together, though they might have been.

M-C Mathew George Ormesby gave evidence of arresting Flanigan: knew deceased - have never seen him drunk.  Saw his thumb bleeding the night of the incident and he said ‘Flanigan done this.’  He would not have Flanigan in charge.  Have known John Flanigan c. 3 years and not known him to be very quarrelsome.  Don’t think the deceased’s thumb was broken as he moved it.  The accident happened on 17 November.  The verdict was death by gangrene of the right arm caused by a wound on the thumb received by a fall in a quarrel at Petersburg, but there is not sufficient evidence to convict the accused.  The coroner should be asked to censure the accused John Flanigan.
