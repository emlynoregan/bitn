The Vegetable Competition was dominated by B. Opperman & W. Moxham once more.

Fruit was barely represented following the boisterous weather which kept R.L. Hunter from Clare away.

Flowers.  Boisterous weather of late had reduced some classes, but the display remained impressive.  Roses, ranunculi and pansies were very good.

[Personal interest: R. Fuss was listed as a judge, but did not appear in the prize list.]

Cookery was very well represented as were home made sweets.

Arts & Industries seems to have been boosted by the decision to limit it to a radius of 60 miles, which gave locals a greater incentive to enter and win prizes.

Photography & Art was an interesting exhibition and an improvement on earlier years.

In the School Class Section Burra was not well represented, but other district schools made up for that.  Ayers Forest with 58 entries scored 50 prizes and World’s End, Leighton, Copperhouse and North Booborowie were all well represented.

On Saturday President I.J. Warnes had an excellent luncheon for 100-150 guests which included several Members of Parliament.  The speeches of the occasion are reported in 1½ columns.
