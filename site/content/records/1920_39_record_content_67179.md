Burra Town Council, Monday

Cr Dow accused the press of reporting meetings in a misleading way and of holding the Council up to ridicule and he moved that unless the press complies with certain conditions it not be admitted to meetings.  Seconded Cr Kellaway and carried.

Press representatives were not allowed to signify any intention and the Council then went into committee.

We admit not being word perfect in reporting, but deny any attempt to mislead or to hold up to ridicule.  Apparently in committee the parking ban came in for full discussion and it was revoked.

‘Further in vindication concerning the accuracy of local press reports we regret to state that Cr Worth, who has been hardly one year in office, tendered his resignation last night.  Further two more Councillors, Crs Jennison and Riggs, who have done a tremendous amount of good in the Council, have refused to offer themselves for election again.’

[No reason is given for Cr Worth’s resignation and the report merely states that a letter from him was read out.  It was received with regret.]

Councillors Jennison, Worth & Riggs were all absent.

[While there is no direct reference to support the conclusion, the writer seems to be implying that the operations of Council had produced dissatisfaction in the absent Councillors.  Certainly the reports show a number of clashes of most Councillors with the Mayor at different times and Cr Dow comes across in the reports as stubborn, thin-skinned and argumentative and even at times petty and self important, but whether this is due to the reporting or to his behaviour is a matter for judgement.]
