Mongolata Goldfield

Baldina-Mongolata is reported to have put through 26½ tons at the battery at 2oz 6dwt per ton.  In early march 14½ tons produced 324oz.

Block 8 crushed 5 tons 2cwt for 1oz 10dwt with tailings to come.

Byles’ Mongolata GM held its AGM in Adelaide 27 March.  Local director I.J. Warnes was re-elected.  The company has a credit balance of nearly £10,000 after paying March dividends.  Development is to continue to water level.

Fortnight to 23 March.

At 200ft level No. 1 winze to 62ft on 3’6” lode of quartz & ironstone veins with traces of gold.

At 52ft level stope off No. 2 south drive produced 10 tons of milling ore averaging 10dwt by pan test.

Opencut northeast of the shaft on a lode 3ft wide averaging 15dwt by pan test.  Drive advanced to 25ft and timbered.

Golden Harp.  No. 1 winze Baker’s Tunnel to 51ft on lode averaging 3ft wide in low grade ore.

Shaft advanced to 48ft with lode at bottom 2ft wide with low values.

59 tons or ore at grass.

Pexton’s Takati Mine.  The recent specimen estimated to contain 130oz of gold has been on display in Adelaide.  Mr Pexton said the mine had sent 176 tons of ore to the battery and recovered 402oz of gold in 2 years.  The largest find of 156oz in April last at a depth of 100ft.

Mongolata Battery.  In the first year of operation the battery has produced bullion worth c. £19,700.

Operations began 16 February 1933 and in 12 months processed 43 parcels of ore totalling 1,691 tons 7cwt to produce 2,696ox 7dwt 21gr worth £10,800-3-11 at the old standard price of £4-4-11½ per oz, but £19,700 at the premium due to the enhanced price of gold on London market and the exchange rate.  Of the £10,800 mentioned £8,709-9-11 came from amalgamation in the battery and £1,091-14-0 from the cyanide process on tailings.  The erection of the battery said Mr Grundy (General Manager of State Batteries) was fully justified.
