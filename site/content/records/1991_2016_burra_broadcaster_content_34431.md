S.T. Gill.  On 27 October 1880 S.T. Gill collapsed and died on the steps of the Melbourne GPO.  He was dressed in ragged clothes of the poor and had no identification on him.  It was twenty-four hours before the police could put a name to the body.  He had been a renowned painter who had once had fame and fortune, but he had been undone by drink and ensuing poverty.  Today he is remembered particularly for his paintings of struggling diggers around Ballarat and for other portraits.  A small S.T. Gill watercolour can currently fetch c. $50,000.  He also painted men toiling for copper and a handsome collection of these works can be seen at the Burra Regional Art Gallery.
