Mrs J. Howell, who appeared in court last week, has lived in the district for many years.  She is very feeble now and suffers from a heart complaint.  When asked what she was doing now she replied: ‘I am dying’.  [Since she survived till 18 November 1925 one might question how good an actor she was on this occasion.]
