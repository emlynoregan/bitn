Sgt J.R. Fetherstonhaugh (25 July 1941.)

He writes of the fighting in Syria, saying they came across the bottom of Syria and captured Tyre without opposition.  From then on they were in the thick of it â€“ though the French navy retreated after a light attack.  They had largely been resting since the armistice.
