Burra Town Council.  At the meeting last Thursday to settle the Chairman of the Public Works Committee Cr Harris’s proposal of Cr Hardy was 2nd by Cr Hardy and declared carried without being put to a vote.  Presumably Cr Hardy would have voted for himself so winning two to one.

There was a meeting to deal with the specification of the duties of officers.

Cr Sampson wanted the Waterworks Engineer to be able to repair meters and the duties were amended to read: ‘repair, clean, regulate and read all meters.’  Cr West 2nd.

Cr Rabbich thought it demanded too much.  Cr Harris supported Cr Sampson and the amendment was carried on the casting vote of the Mayor.

Cr Hardy moved the Inspector return all fees received for weights and measures to Council.  Not 2nd.  His duties remained unchanged.

After some discussion including legal questions it was decided to allow all officers to occupy their position during the pleasure of the Council.
