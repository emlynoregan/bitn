Redruth Court, 30 January.

Emanuel Frederick was fined 2/6 + 5/- for a stray cow.

John Jenkins of Sevenhills was fined 5/- + 5/- for rounding a corner in Redruth at more than walking pace.

Thomas Gattrell was fined 2/6 + 5/- for a stray cow

Mrs S.A. Short was fined 2/6 + 5/- for a stray cow

The father of Donatus & George Herbert brought a case against them for failure to support him.  The case was dismissed upon their agreeing to do so.

Thomas Jones was charged that on 30 January he set fire to grass in the Koonoona Paddock.  His behaviour showed he was familiar with the inside of courthouses and how to behave there.

W.G. Hawkes:  Gave evidence of being at the north end of Porter’s Lagoon on Tuesday when he saw smoke rising and then found fire near John White’s house. He then saw a second fire near the main road on Fisher’s farm.  He met J. White and Joseph Webb, who said a swagman had lit the fires and gone on towards Black Springs.  Went after the prisoner and found the grass alight on their run.  Tried to extinguish the fire and then went overtook the prisoner.  He said I would have to prove it as no one saw him lighting the fires.  Also said later it would be a good job if all the farmers were burnt out.

J. Fisher:  Gave evidence of seeing the prisoner 15 yards from the fire.  Asked him to help put it out, but he made no reply.  Saw him go onto my property, saw him stoop and a fire started.

John White:  Gave corroborative evidence.  Saw the third fire on Koonoona.

Jones was committed to stand trial at the next criminal sittings on the charge of setting fire to grass near J. White’s house and on a further charge relating to the fire at J. fisher’s.

Evidence also given showed he had only been out of Adelaide Gaol for a month and was at the site of a fire in J. Lewis’s paddock near Copperhouse a few days ago and is likely to face a charge in relation to that also.  [See XV, 328(2), 27 Feb. 1895, page 3]
