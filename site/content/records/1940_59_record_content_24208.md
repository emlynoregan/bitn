Obituary.  Mr & Mrs C.J. Pearce.  The deaths of Mr & Mrs C.J. Pearce has left a gap in Methodism that will be keenly felt.  Mr Pearce lived only three and a half weeks after his wife’s death.

Both were born in Burra, Mr Pearce in 1859 and Mrs Pearce in 1856. [Sic. Error: the dates should be reversed.]   Mr Pearce was the youngest son of Mr William (Tailor) Pearce and his wife was the daughter of Andrew Thomas, Government Assayist at the Burra Smelting Works.  They were married in 1883 and lived together for 62½ years, 56 of which were spent in Burra.  Both were very active in patriotic work during WWI.  They had five sons and five daughters and four of the children predeceased them: Colin, Courtney, Max and Leah (Mrs T. James).

Mr Pearce was Secretary of the Rechabite Lodge in Burra for 58 years.

[This was 63 years in his obituary in Vol. 66, 43, 30 October 1945, page 1. And 62 years on his leaving Burra as reported Vol. 60, 8, 21 Feb. 1939, page 2.]
