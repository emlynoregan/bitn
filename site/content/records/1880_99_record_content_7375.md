Fire Inquest.  The premises of Mr John Jones, Bootmaker of Redruth, were destroyed by fire on the morning of 6 July.  The shop was a galvanised iron on wood frame building with a calico ceiling and iron roof.  There is no fireplace and no use of fire, but a kerosene lamp was in use.  The contents of the shop were £10 of leather and the stock of boots and shoes worth c. £50-£60.  Jones blew out the lamp and left at 7.30 p.m. Wednesday.  He knew of no ill will towards himself, but believed there was some towards his landlord, Mr Gray - some quarrel with Mr O’Farrell about ownership of the land.

Lewis Jones, brother of John Jones, gave confirming evidence.

John Robinson Gray, owner of the workshop, confirmed a quarrel with O’Farrell over the ownership.

Catherine Linkson, wife of George Linkson, lives nearby - only a footpath in between.  She was awoken by the sound of the fire about 3.40 a.m. on Thursday.

William Neville who keeps the Court House Hotel was woken about 4 a.m. by cries of  ‘Fire’ and saw Jones’s workshop alight.  With 4 or 5 teamsters from the hotel we managed to put out the fire with buckets of water.  It was the front part of the building that was on fire.

O’Farrell helped to put out the fire.

William Linkson, letter carrier and son of George Linkson, gave supporting evidence and advised the police of the fire.

Lewis Davis, aged 12, son of Lewis Davis, lives nearby said he saw a light in Jones’s c. 8-9 p.m. Wednesday, but no one else did.

William Prior, farmer of Baldina, saw no light when he passed 8-9 p.m. Wednesday.

William Farrell was aroused by the blaze of a fire about 3 a.m., his wife having been disturbed by the noise of horses in the yard.  Julia Farrell corroborated her husband’s evidence.

David Smith, painter, of Redruth saw no lights when he passed at 8.15 p.m.

P-C Richard Phelan could give no definite cause for the fire, but it appeared to be either maliciously set or by one who intended to plunder the shop.

The jury’s verdict was in line with Phelan’s views: the building was ‘wilfully and maliciously set on fire by person or persons unknown.’
