Burra & District Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial

A general meeting at the Institute on Thursday was held to hear objections, if any, to the inscriptions or the arrangement of names.  There was only a small attendance and none from the district.  T.E. Richards, Chair of the Hallett DC sent apologies.  James Taylor & Sons wrote from Footscray on 26 October explaining that the delay in preparing the granite was due to the shortage of workmen.  Four stonecutters nominated to come from Scotland have not come and advertisements in Sydney and New Zealand have been to no avail.  They had only five or six men to do work that required 16.

The gross in cash and redeemable promises was £2,371-11-7.  The final wording was approved.  Mr Hawkes thought the names should carry neither rank nor honours.  Dr Steele thought they should.  It was decided to write again to the Commandant seeking his advice – no reply having been received to an earlier letter.
