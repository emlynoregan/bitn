Penny Maynard (21) of Burra is one of five young people who have recently returned from America after competing in the International Mounted Games.  The Mounted Games are a series of very fast races requiring a high degree of athletic ability, good riding skills and hand and eye co-ordination.  The Australian team was invited to compete against fifteen other all-American teams at their own expense and without the use of their own horses or saddle gear.  The games were held in Washington.

The Australians finished an impressive fourth, which was a fantastic result, given they were not using their own horses and arrived only a couple of days before competition began.  Penny is a senior member of the Burra Pony Club and also an instructor and Club President.  [Photo.]
