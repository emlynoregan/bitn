The Opening of the Burra heritage Town Jubilee 150 Project

A crowd of between 300 and 400 participated in this event against a backdrop of a gathering storm.  The Chairman of the Burra Burra DC Cr Jack McMahon welcomed everyone and outlined the history of the project.  Mr Kym Bonython, chairman of the Jubilee 150 Board, spoke of the significance of the State’s Jubilee celebrations and of how diverse they had been and how much the people of South Australia had joined in with the spirit of the sesquicentenary.  The honour of opening the project went to Mr Keith Jones, the Director-General of the Department of Mines and Energy, representing the Minister, the Hon. R.G. Payne.

Mr Johns is a descendant of Mr Thomas Roberts, the first Captain of the Burra Burra Mine.  He spoke of the three components – Morphett’s Engine House, the Bon Accord Mine Site and Museum and the Kingston Street Row of the Paxton Square Cottages.  As well as funding from J150, grants have also come from the Department of Mines & Energy, the Department of Tourism and the Department of Environment and Planning.  Just as the project was declared open heavy rain fell, but later it cleared sufficiently for the crowd to travel from site to site.

The Heritage Town Working Party extended thanks in particular to:

Adelaide & Wallaroo Fertilizers

Burra Apexians

David Jennings and the Queen’s Scouts and Venturers

Robyn Page & Chris Oswald and the Town Hall

Shirley Thamm for flowers

Richard Lockheed for his video record.
