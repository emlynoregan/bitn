The Proposed Centenary Rodeo has run into difficulties and may have to be abandoned.  The dry nature of the season is making it difficult to provide feed for the horses.  The organisers of the Marrabel Rodeo report difficulties in getting steers for their rodeo.  [See also notice on page 2 of this issue.]
