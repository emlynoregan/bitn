Tom Canny the Labor candidate spoke at Burra on 26 February in the Lodge Room.  The meeting was chaired by the Mayor Mr S. Kellaway.  The speaker condemned Mr Butler taking a five-year term without mandate and extolled the democratic principles of Mr Lacey.  He spoke against Butler’s gerrymander.  Butler had increased rail freight charges by 25% and then wants support when he dropped them 20%.  He also spoke against the Debt Adjustment Act which is to the detriment of unsecured creditors and the farmer.  He condemns Butler’s taxation proposals and the £100,000 expenditure on Parliament House – which he says will be nearer £300,000 by the time it is finished.  Labour also wanted free education from kindergarten to University and the dole abolished and work given at award rates. A vigorous housing policy was also needed.
