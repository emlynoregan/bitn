Editorial.  Closing of Redruth Gaol.

Despite the heading the first half column is concerned with the low prices prevailing for wool, cattle and sheep.

[The closing of the Gaol did not seem to have merited any mention in the paper until it actually happened so perhaps it came without warning.]

The editor suggests it be turned into a freezing or chilling works and be connected to the railway by a spur line.]
