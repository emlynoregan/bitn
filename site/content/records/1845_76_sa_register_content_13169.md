Kooringa News, 28 March

Election Day at Kooringa saw a contest between the champions of the Political Association, Messrs Dale, Cole and Lennon and their opponents Messrs Kingston, Browne and Cullen.  The Burra Hotel was the chief polling place and was much frequented throughout the day.  Polling closed at 4 p.m.

All Saturday the chief topic of conversation was the result.  On Monday the scrutineers came and plied their task for hour after hour, while outside numbers of people waited for the result.  This eventually revealed that the Political Association had won an overwhelming majority.  Yesterday there was a goodly gathering when the returning officer declared Messrs Dale, Cole and Lennon duly elected members for the District of Burra and Clare.

‘The result is regarded with much regret by the more sober-minded and thinking portion of the community, who cannot but see the evil of sending men to Parliament merely because they happen to possess a popular species of oratory which wins the public ear, or because they profess political opinions in accordance with the views of the majority.’
