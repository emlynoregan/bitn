Kooringa News, 26 February

Obituary.  Last Thursday saw the funeral of the late Mr Humphry of Baldino [sic: Baldina].  The gentleman had been ill for some months, so his death was not unexpected.  Large numbers of persons in carts and on horseback went out for the funeral.  The funeral procession, headed by Rev. W. Davidson, and consisting of 21 vehicles besides a number of horsemen, left Baldino at about 3 p.m. and proceeded to the United Presbyterian Church in Kooringa, where Rev. Davidson read the funeral service.  The cortege then again formed with the Freemasons (of which the deceased was a member) walking on foot to the cemetery, where another brief ceremony was held.  Crowds of people thronged to see the funeral.  Unfortunately there was another sensation when, just as Rev. Davidson was about to commence the service in the church, Dr Mayne, who was present, was suddenly taken ill and had to be taken home.  The attack proved to be apoplexy and paralysis and was so severe that it left the gentleman completely prostrated. Doubts were entertained of his recovery, but since then he has improved slightly, though he remains in a precarious state.  These events cast quite a gloom over the town and the doctorâ€™s professional services are greatly missed.

[James Humphrey died 18 February 1862 at Baldina aged 53.]
