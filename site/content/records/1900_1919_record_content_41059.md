Burra Town Council

Cr McBride moved that a footbridge be constructed at the Mine Bridge.  Cr McWaters 2nd.  Carried

The Pig and Whistle [footbridge] is to be repaired.

Some repairs will be made to the Rotunda roof.

Cr Radford moved that Bagot, Shakes and Lewis be approached to allow their yards to be used as a town pound yard.

The Mayor pointed out that such a move would involve appointing a pound-keeper and pound fees would not cover feed.  The motion lapsed.

Paxton Square.

Cr McBride acknowledged the Hon. J. Lewis’s generosity, but pointed out that the present condition of the property would involve the Council in very great expense.  Perhaps it would be better if it were transferred to a private trust.

The Mayor said in the first place the Council stood to lose £13-£15 p.a. in rates.

Cr Radford said the Council should have a full report from the Inspector and Health Officer to put before Mr Lewis.  Carried.

A letter will be sent to Mr Lewis outlining the Council’s position.
