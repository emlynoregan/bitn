Fire.  At 11.30 a.m. Friday 5 January Sgt G.E. McDonald was advised of a fire burning a mile north of Booborowie.  On a fence near the fire were a charred blanket and a piece of charred canvas.  Further on there was an Aboriginal in charge of a mob of horses.  A strong southwest gale spread the fire in the property of I.J. Warnes section 620 where it burnt barley stubble and from there it entered a paddock of Francis Hogan.  It destroyed 200 bales of straw and lucerne (valued at £5-5-0 per 60 bales) as well as 10 acres of Warnes’ barley stubble and 25 acres of Hogan’s grass – valued at £10-£12 per acre.  Harry Donovan the Aboriginal was charged with a breach of the Bush Fires Act.  Evidence from Dennis Kelly, Frank Kelly, Jack Kelly and Arthur Baynes told of seeing Donovan try to put out the fire with a branch and of its getting away from him.  Donovan admitted lighting a fire and trying to put out the fire from a spark that got away.  He was fined £5 plus 30/- costs or 10 days.
