The Fossils at Kooringa

F.G. Waterhouse, Curator of the SA Institute Museum, 10 June.

On examining the bones in Captain Gregorâ€™s cottage near the Burra Cemetery I immediately recognised them as the remains of the gigantic extinct animal Diprotodon australis of which many fossil specimens have already been found in SA and are well preserved at the museum.  The bones examined consist of a much-decayed lower jaw (left ramus) with four true molar teeth, having roots displayed by the decay of the jaw bone, a portion of upper jaw containing some molar teeth and a small portion of the zygomatic arch.  Also two lower incisors detached from the bone.  These are straight and about 7 inches long and were originally deeply embedded in the jaw.  And two upper incisors also detached, which are much curved.  Among other bone fragments were portions of a scapula or shoulder blade.

Captain Gregor accompanied me to the discovery site.  The jawbone is the most persistent part of the skeleton and it was in such a decayed state that I deemed it unnecessary to incur the expense of further excavation in the hope of finding more, especially as the animal is well known.  Others had already made a good search around the spot.

Sir Thomas Mitchell in his expedition into the interior found a large number of fossil mammalian remains.  Among then was a large tooth identified by Professor Owen in 1838 as that of a gigantic marsupial allied to the kangaroo, but having remarkable affinities to the large non-marsupial pachyderms.  Subsequently there were discoveries of other parts of the skeleton and eventually of an entire skull.  This was almost three feet long.  The hind legs were much shortened and the forelegs longer and strengthened compared with a kangaroo.  The discoveries have been made in the most recent geological formations in Queensland and NSW and in several places in SA and so at one time this animal must have been widely distributed over the continent.
