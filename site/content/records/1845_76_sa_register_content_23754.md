Agriculture.  The crops for twenty miles to the north are in excellent condition.  There is no blight and some wheat stands five feet high and this in a district which only a few years ago was said to be unfit for agriculture.  A competent judge has inspected many farms and expects the yield to be between 20 and 30 bushels per acre.
