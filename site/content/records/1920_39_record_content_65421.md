Joe Meers aged 17 was coming home with a dray on 26 December when the horse bolted near home.  As he tried to pull up the horse the winkers broke and it is thought he then jumped from the dray sustaining serious head injuries.  He was critical and unconscious till 1 January when he regained consciousness and has improved somewhat.
