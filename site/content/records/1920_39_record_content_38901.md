Frank Treloar: Looking back

The History of a Once Well-Known Racehorse.  From a Station Hack to Adelaide Cup Winner.

Early settlers bred a fine light horse for riding.  Traps were not then much used and draught animals were bullocks.  Draught horses came into their own after pleuro-pneumonia knocked out the bullock teams.  Many stations had good stallions that produced some excellent racehorses.

e.g.	Bowman Bros at Crystal Brook	South Australian

H.B. Hughes at Booyoolie		Croupier

Mr Hawker at Bungaree		Varo

Gleesons at Clare (Inchiquin)	Rarey

Peter Brady at Mintaro		Jersey

Early race meetings were organised by a small committee and always included two post entry events: hacks and hurry skurry, usually the best contested and most amusing of the day.  Racehorses would come from those in everyday use.

Later in the day some trouble might arise from those who imbibed too freely and if the owner of the booth overlooked watering his supplies sufficiently, which was a rare thing.  The police soon stopped trouble.  Afterwards, with friendships renewed the crowd would return to their daily work and so would the horses.

The Waif (assumed) foaled on Booyoolie Station near present day Gladstone and his sire was Croupier.  At about one year the bay with a small star on his forehead and white hind fetlock was branded UZ and gelded.  Heavy rains knocked down fences in the weaning paddock and he joined outside mobs of horses.  He caught strangles, which he ultimately survived as a wreck, miserable and weak.  He ended up impounded at Bimbowrie Pound a few miles north of Blyth from where he was sold as valueless.  The new owner gave him good feed and in spring he made up lost condition and became a useful horse and after breaking in was sold to Gleeson’s of ‘Inchiquin’ Clare and went to their Black Point out-station (near present day Snowtown).  At Black Point there was a wild mob of horses led by a mare known as Black Queen.

[Treloar then gives a long account of how The Waif was used to ride down the Black Queen and so enabled the wild mob to be yarded.]  To be Continued.
