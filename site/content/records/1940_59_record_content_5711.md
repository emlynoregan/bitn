‘Get Busy’ writes supporting the laudable efforts to get the Aberdeen Quarry going again and also supporting Cr Lott’s interest in the further testing of the Burra Mine.  The writer doubts the wisdom of cancelling the Burra Show this year.  (Other shows are being held.)  And the Burra Races were also cancelled.  Such events help maintain the town’s prosperity and profits could go to patriotic funds.
