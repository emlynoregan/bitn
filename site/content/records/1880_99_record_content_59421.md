The Guards’ Band visited Burra on Thursday.  Their number has been reduced, but the quality remains.  On Thursday afternoon they played for Burra Hospital patients.  A successful open-air meeting in Market Square and subsequently a ‘£7-10-0 house’ greeted the performers.  They left Burra the following morning for the north.
