Hospital Appeal Results.  The Ball raised £53-12-0, the Frolic £10-11-0 and the Mannequin Parade £4 for a total of £68-3-0.  Despite earlier more complex divisions being suggested, it says here that the sum was split equally between the Burra Hospital, The Baby Welfare Clinic and the After Care Treatment of Paralysis of the Children’s Hospital.
