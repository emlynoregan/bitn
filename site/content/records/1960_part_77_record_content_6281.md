Burra High School Parents & Friends’ Association was addressed by Inspector Glastonbury on Tuesday 18 April.  He said parents could do much towards their child’s education.  Plans to improve the playing area would be discussed.  120 chairs for the hall, which had been applied for earlier in the year, had been approved.

Students will go to Kapunda for the Mid-Northern High Schools’ Sports on Thursday 27 April.  On Saturday assistance by parents made it possible for Intermediate students to go to Adelaide to see a performance of Julius Caesar.  Plans for Education Week have now been finalised.

Burra Golf Season will begin on 29 April.
