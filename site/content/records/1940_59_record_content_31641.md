Obituary.  Mr J. Cyril Murray died suddenly at his home ‘Catarpo’ Mt Bryan on Wednesday last week.  He had suffered from a weak heart for a considerable period, but his death came as a shock to friends across the district and state.  He was only 54.  He was born at Mt Crawford and was the son of the Late Mr & Mrs Alex Murray who pioneered the Mt Crawford property soon after arriving from Scotland.  Mr Cyril Murray spent his boyhood at Mt Crawford and was educated at St Peter’s College in Adelaide.  In 1919 the Catarpo Stud was established Mr Murray came to live there.  He recently sold a portion of the property with the intention of retiring from active business.

He was one of the best polo players seen in Australia and captained the Mt Crawford team.  When the team remained undefeated in 1925 in an International series, Sydney papers acclaimed him one of the best backmen to have played in this country.

The late Mr Murray was also one of the best fieldshots in SA and rarely missed a chance to make a kill.  He loved horses and his skill as a horse trainer was outstanding.

He was also a great craftsman and had a splendidly equipped workshop at Catarpo – for example, during the war when firearms were so scarce, he made ball ammunition that could be fired through an ordinary shot gun.  It was tested by the VDC authorities and shown capable of penetrating a Bren Gun Carrier.  It was classified as efficient for use should the need arise.  He also evolved a method of rechambering a certain type of rifle to take .303 shells for use by the VDC.  At the age of 19 he built a sulky that was used on the property for 20 years or more.

He was a great judge of sheep, though he did not exhibit at shows.

He volunteered for service in WWI, but was rejected on health grounds.  He volunteered for the AIF in WWII and served for six months before being discharged on health grounds.

He is survived by a wife and two children, Mr Ron Murray of Mt Bryan and Marjorie, Mrs C. Angas of Angaston.
