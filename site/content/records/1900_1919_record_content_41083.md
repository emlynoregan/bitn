The Mayor said it was essential that they take steps to establish a fire brigade.

Cr Lane said Kapunda had a volunteer brigade and the water pressure in Kooringa was excellent.

The Mayor said a couple of lengths of hose and a hand reel would suffice and he heard the tender for the enlarged reservoir had been let.

The Town Clerk said the Adelaide Fire Brigade estimated the cost of a reel etc. at £63.

Cr Radford suggested postponing till the annual meeting of ratepayers, when the matter could be put before them.  He didn’t know where all the money would come from.

It was decided to visit Kapunda and Gawler and gather all the relevant information and report next meeting.
