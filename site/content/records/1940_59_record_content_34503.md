Burra Town Council, 15 December

The Mayor H.J.B. Jennison entertained the Councillors, Town Clerk & Overseer at supper at the Northern Café after the Council meeting.  He wished them the compliments of the season and pointed out that in February 1948 the overseer Mr H. Wilson would complete 33 years of service.  He had in that time attended 1,107 funerals as curator of Burra Cemetery.

Redruth Methodist Church held Special Christmas Services on Sunday.  The evening service was a choral and carol singing service and Rev. Pitman preached on the Christmas message.  The choir was combined from the Redruth, Ironmine, Mt Bryan and Hanson Choirs.
