W.G. Hawkes writes expressing his concern at attempts by some to weaken efforts for a central expression of their obligation to honour fallen soldiers.  ‘Any pride and importance it [Burra] possesses is well known to be due to, and shared by, its rich and prosperous surroundings.  The setting up of rivalries or jealousies is deplorable in any case, but on such a solemn undertaking as I write, is most reprehensible.’

He goes on to say that the memorial he feels should be, as said by another high official, a district shrine ‘with a sense of detachment which would arrest and focus the attention of the vastness of the national sacrifices’.  No utilitarian buildings could have such an appeal and war museums preserving the horrors and the material ingenuities of war would not perpetuate the nobler memories ‘or the spiritual ideals which have justified the war and its sacrifices’. 

He goes on to support a monument, but wonders if a quieter, but nearby spot, might not be more suitable than Market Square.  As a postscript he says since writing he has read Mr N. Hiles Pearse’s excellent contribution and agrees with that gentleman’s tribute to the patriotism of Burra war workers led by the worthy Mayor.
