The meeting last Saturday was chaired by Mr Nock and with many of the 60-70 present being Germans, Mr Kruger acted as interpreter.  Mr Bagot addressed the meeting as a candidate for Parliament.

He pointed to some of the constitutional changes and their possible results in terms of policy:

Adult male suffrage with a six months residency requirement had given the vote to the German residents for the first time.

Parliament had gained control of the Land Fund. [That is money raised from the sale of Crown Land.]

This change should result a fairer distribution of expenditure on roads; the northern roads had been shamefully neglected in the past.

The Governor would no longer be able to spend huge sums on his own pet projects; as in the case of the Port Elliot breakwater, for example.

Men born in a foreign country were no longer excluded from election to Parliament.

Roads and railways north of Adelaide would receive more attention.

More would be done for general education.
