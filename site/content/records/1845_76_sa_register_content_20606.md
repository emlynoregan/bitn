Kooringa News, 15 May

The Railway Meeting at Burra Hotel on 14 May was a great success, even though the weather was bad.

The Local Court heard a case of cattle stealing last Monday.  Messrs Ware & Chapman have for a long period discovered cattle losses from their run.  They found the carcases had been removed on horseback.  On 2 May they came across Joseph Webb and Edward Rowe at work cutting up a carcase.  One of them offered the stock-keeper £5 to turn a blind eye.  The Bench committed the defendants to the Supreme Court.

Princess Royal Mine continues to look promising.  10 tons of good ore are at grass and the men at work calculate they have earned £1 each per day.

Mr Murphy has made a new copper discovery at Booborowie.  15 cwt of ore was brought in for smelting on Wednesday.

Men are still at work at the Barrier Ranges, but there is no news of actual gold being recovered.

Miners are leaving Burra daily in search of work, which has been rather difficult to obtain.
