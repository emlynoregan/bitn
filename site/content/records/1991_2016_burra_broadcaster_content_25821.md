The Bon Accord Hotel

Thym Bitter’s Bon Accord Hotel is one of Burra’s recent success stories.  His promotion of the hotel as a ‘party pub’ has taken off and on Friday and Saturday nights the pub really comes alive and not just locals, but visitors from Clare, Eudunda, Riverton, Robertstown and further afield turn up for the loud music and the atmosphere of the Mid North’s new hot spot.  The pub offers late night closing on Fridays and Saturdays and in the week four pool teams are playing in a Wednesday night competition.  Nominated drivers are provided with free soft drinks to encourage responsible driving.
