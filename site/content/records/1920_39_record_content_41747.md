Obituary.  Mrs Josiah Thomas died at her residence 26 April aged 82.  She is said to have been the first girl born at Redruth on 11 January 1850.  Her parents were Mr & Mrs H. Pinch.  He father built the first house in Redruth, having been washed out of a dugout in the creek.  [Henry Pinch’s obituary says he sold his house in the creek for £3 and it was washed out shortly afterwards.]  It being the times of the gold rush to Victoria there were few men about and Mr Pinch had to carry all the timber required up the hill on his back.  He later took up land near Burra at ‘Pencarrow’ where he farmed successfully.  There were two daughters: the late Mrs E.N. Finch and Mrs Thomas.  On 15 February 1869 Miss Mary Pinch married Mr Josiah Thomas in the old Church of England on Limestone Hill where G.H. Dow’s house now stands.  They went to live at ‘Three Trees’ which Mr Thomas acquired on the death of his father and where they lived for just over 60 years and which she held until her death.  Mr Thomas died soon after their diamond wedding in 1929 and Mrs Thomas came to live in Aberdeen.  She was an untiring worker for the Women’s Branch of the Liberal Federation, the Women’s Christian Temperance Assoc. and Redruth Methodist Church and a silent worker relieving many genuine cases of distress.  She was renowned for her hospitality and business acumen.  Of a family of four only Maud Mrs C. Wesley Gare survives.  The late Mr H.H. Thomas of ‘The Pines’ who died in 1919 was the only son.  There are 9 grandchildren and several [great-] grandchildren.
