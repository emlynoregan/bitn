Burra Town Council

Letter from M. Sampson asking to lease Carey’s Flat to grow lucerne and erect fowl pens and plant trees and shrubs if supplied.  Decision deferred.

The Mayor reported the Council had bought certain allotments intersected by a road and also some of the creek frontage.

Commonwealth Military Authorities were granted the use of Victoria Park for a camp for 130 men and officers from 14-18 August.

Council discussed the possibility of raising a loan for electricity supply, considering sources, rates of interest and whether it could be a scheme applied to only two wards etc.  One unknown was consumption.  Many of the lights in Kooringa would be in shops and be used much less than the lights in houses in Aberdeen.  Cr Lowe argued for the North Ward to be included as in the long run usage would increase and he moved accordingly.  Cr Walker 2nd.

Cr Lane moved the scheme be confined to East and West Wards, as they would have to bear most of the cost if North Ward produced a loss, even though he paid rates there himself.  Cr Parks 2nd.

Cr Harris regretted Cr Lowe and Cr Walker’s stand.  Cr Lane’s amendment was carried 4 to 2.

[The actual report in column 3 is somewhat confused and sometimes says the reverse of what the context demands.  A correction was published in XX, 1055, 13 August.]

The Council was concerned about men and boys kicking footballs in the streets, endangering themselves and the drivers of vehicles.

Council refused to replace the damaged lamp at the post office in Kooringa.
