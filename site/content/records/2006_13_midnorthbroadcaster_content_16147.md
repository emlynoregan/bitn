Merrie Elliott of Burra wrote re the death of Evan Hawke, expressing the respect she had for him as a result of his participation in the group of concerned citizens that stood up to do something in April 2012 when Dr Dharma  had her attending rights to accidents and emergencies at the Burra Hospital removed by Country Health.  He refused to be intimidated by the bureaucracy and like the rest of the group refused to cave in to their overbearing pressure.  [The rest of her letter goes on about Country Health and the doctors.]
