Burra Community Sports Club Inc.

President Paul B. Wilson’s Annual Report

It has been a year of rebuilding and consolidation.  Council assisted with the extensions to our building.  A verandah was added to the back.  After rebuilding was completed we built a new and bigger netball change-room, a new storeroom to allow more space for football, cricket and umpire facilities, a small keg and bottle store and the enlargement of the kitchen facilities.   Much effort will now nee to be put into improving the external areas of the Burra War Memorial Oval.  Discussion on the possible inclusion of tennis courts is also ongoing.

[Thanks are extended to various helpers and especially those involved in fundraising activities.]
