Editorial on the Town Council loan, which was approved without the need for a poll.  They have got a purchaser for the bonds at par and a rate of 6%.  Mr Lane produced figures to show that the estimates indicated that 37% of the sum on work would go in salaries and other management costs and though this seems high when compared with the proposed expenditure - £250 out of £675 - it is not so if compared with other years when expenditure was £1,200 or more, nor with what will be possible now that the loan is approved.

Mr Ridgway considered overdrafts immoral and thought it little less than a crime for one Council to anticipate another.  This arises from a misconception in that Councils are forever and merely change councillors.  A Council is constantly pledging its successor.

The Council Bonds have been taken at par by Mr J. Richardson.
