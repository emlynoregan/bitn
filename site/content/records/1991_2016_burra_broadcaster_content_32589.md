Minister for Tourism, Jane Lomax-Smith has responded to a letter from Tony Thorogood re Terowie and in it indicates her concerns about its future.

Preserving its key visitor attractions is beyond the resources of a small community.  It needs the co-operation of all key stakeholders:	The SA Tourism Commission

Regional Council of Goyder

Department of Environment & Heritage

The Community of Peterborough

She identified three issues:

The need to identify, stabilise and conserve/maintain key surviving heritage assets.

The need to develop good visual interpretation at several significant sites.

The need of the host community to exercise some degree of care and management over any improvements undertaken.

The minister has asked SATAC to convene meetings to canvass these issues and see how these challenges could be met.
