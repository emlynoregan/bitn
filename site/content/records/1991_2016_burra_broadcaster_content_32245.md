Thorogood’s Apple Wines helped to host a breakfast at Tateham’s Restaurant at Auburn over the weekend.  Up to 120 national and international journalists are currently showcasing areas of SA during the Tasting Australia event.  In a day in the Clare Valley they had the opportunity to task local wines, olive oil blends, Burra Saltbush Hogget, free range grain fed chicken, handmade condiments, carob products, blue gum honey and of course, Thorogood’s Apple Wines.
