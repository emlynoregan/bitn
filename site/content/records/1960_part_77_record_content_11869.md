Burra CWA held its AGM and Secretary Mrs F. Scroop reported a good year.

Membership was 80 and average attendance was 24.

In 1961 the new CWA rooms were opened and dedicated to a much loved pioneer of the CWA, Mrs Mary Warnes.  They were opened 30 June by Mrs Dolling OBE and the memorial plaque was unveiled by Mr Rex Warnes, the eldest son of the late Mrs Warnes. The CWA again catered for the race luncheon in September.  At the International Day Mr A.L. Clode presented on behalf of himself and family a very lovely polished table in memory of his late wife, who had been an active and good CWA worker.  Also the rooms received their new toilet floor covering and a large green and yellow blind for the western window.  Mrs Ralph Murray was the guest speaker.  CWA also catered for the race meeting on 21 March.  The branch catered for several weddings as well in the year.  Thanks are also due to the Trustees of the late Mrs Warnes for donating the land on which the branch is built and to Mr Jackman for drawing up the plans.
