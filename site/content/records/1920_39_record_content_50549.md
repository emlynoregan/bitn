Mongolata Goldfield

The President of the AWU visited eastern shearing sheds and the goldfield on his return.  He said it had produced 39.8% of SAâ€™s gold in 1933 and was not being properly exploited.  At present 80 men were working on the field.

Takati (W. Pexton & Sons) has crushed 26 tons at 3oz per ton with cyanide returns to come.

Water Supply

A.D. McDonald has received a reply from the Commissioner of Public works concerning water quality from the government tank at Mongolata.  The water is discoloured due to the material used in half the catchment.  A bacteriological examination shows it safe to drink.  The matter is being taken up with the contractors who advised on the material used.
