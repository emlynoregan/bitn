Accident.  On Wednesday evening last there was a collision between Mr N.J. Tiddy on a bicycle and Mr R. Fuss in a motor car near Frank Harris’s shop.  A stationary bus had obscured the view of both.  Mr Tiddy received a nasty fall and some severe cuts and abrasions necessitating several stitches.  He will be confined to his rooms for two to three weeks.

[Personal note: Clarrie Fuss, a passenger in the car told me that they had just come from visiting Mrs R. Fuss in the Burra Hospital.]
