Andrew Gebhardt’s Carob Orchard is now 20 years old.  He imported twelve varieties of carob from California to establish the southern hemisphere’s first carob plantation and now the ‘Macarob’ enterprise is flourishing.  The carob produces a bean pod and the fleshy exterior of the seeds contains 50% complex sugars and exhibits an unusual malty flavour.  The Gebhardts set out to raise a high quality crop and concentrated on producing carob syrups.  Today there are some 7,000 trees planted over 125 acres.  The syrup is sold in Australia and exported to Korea.  The seeds are due to be exported to England, where they are used to make a food thickener known as Emulsifier 410.  The carobs are good for the environment, with no chemical requirements and only modest water needs.  Carob can be used as a chocolate substitute and it lacks the theobromines and caffeine that make chocolate a headache for some people.
