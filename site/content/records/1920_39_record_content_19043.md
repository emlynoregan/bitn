Rain has finally come, but has been extremely patchy.  To the east falls were as low as 10 points at Koomooloo and as high as 120 at Glenora.  At W. Lloydâ€™s at Braefoot 118 points fell and in Aberdeen 208 points were recorded, but as close as Princess Royal only 3 points fell.  The Burra Creek flowed strongly giving it a needed clean out.
