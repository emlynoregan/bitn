All buildings in the Burra Burra Mine area: Powder Magazine, unnamed draft engine house, Welsh Chimney, Cornish Chimney, relocated Peacock’s Chimney & Storeman’s Residence.

Drawings are printed of Redruth Gaol, St Mary’s Anglican Church, Old Kooringa Post Office [though this is wrongly labelled as the Town Hall] and Burra Railway Station [though this is not named in the printed list: which admittedly says they are ‘among the proposed buildings…’]
