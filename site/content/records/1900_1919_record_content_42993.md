Burra Cheer-up Society.  In the past week two more of our soldiers have been home on leave from camp: Privates Bishop and Bulbeck.  The shortness of their stay prevented a farewell, but they were given Cheer-up parcels of woollen comforts etc.

Ptes Wilson and Bowman have sent thanks for parcels received.  Pte H. Harris is in hospital with sickness after being at Gallipoli.  Mrs Seager has written to say that the large hall in the Cheer-up Society’s building for wounded soldiers in Adelaide will be called the ‘Burra Hall’.
