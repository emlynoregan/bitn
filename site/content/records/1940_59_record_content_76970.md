Fire.  A fire, which started on Mr Treweek’s property between Hallett and Mt Bryan, soon crossed the road to Mr Lines’ property and then burnt 400-500 acres of feed before crossing another road to Mr Willis’s property, known as ‘Stewart’s,’ which was burnt out except for 30-40 acres.  100 acres of lucerne in seed was lost and three stacks of compressed meadow hay.  The fire then went over the hill to Jim Quinn’s, where it burnt one fair-sized paddock and part of another before it was stopped at the road. It was not realised that the fire was not just stubble for some time, which allowed it to get away.  Miles of fencing went, but only one sheep was burnt, though a number of Mr Willis’s rams were singed.
