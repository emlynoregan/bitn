Burra Burra Mine

Joe Ford’s Shaft is still being worked, but Ford is saying little about prospects.  Some splendid ore has been raised and is soon to be dressed.

The derrick at the [second bore site in the] mine has been completed and boring is being watched with interest.

SAMA is said to be claiming Royalty on the newly formed syndicate.  The property we understand belongs to the E. & A. Copper Co. who took a 99 year lease so it is doubtful if a legal claim can be made, but it will no doubt soon be worked out.  Even if a royalty has to be paid the syndicate is determined to proceed.  [An item in XV, 359, 19 Apr. 1899, page 2 makes it clear this refers to the slagheap syndicate not the syndicate to work Bunts’s.]

A syndicate is about to be formed to work Bunts’s at the Burra Mine and an application has been made to SAMA.  When the mine closed Bunts’s was said to be yielding good ore and it is a shaft free of water.
