Burra Cheer-up Soc.

Last Thursday the Ladies’ band etc. were at the station to welcome the O’Brien brothers of Aberdeen.

[We have not been able to further identify these brothers.]

On Friday the Ladies’ band etc. turned out for Pte Harry Webster.

On Monday it was the turn of Will Davey & Trooper Jack Turner to be welcomed.

Buttons will be sold on 22 August to aid the appeal for a Memorial Hall for ‘State Boys’ who enlisted.

[That is wards of the State, 286 of whom enlisted and of whom 44 paid the supreme sacrifice.  Three won the MM and 1 a DCM and was twice mentioned in despatches.]

A photo has been received of L-Cpl Alan Bertram.
