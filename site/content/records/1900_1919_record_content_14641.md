Reminiscences of John Hele.

In 1848 he was a bullock teamster to Burra when most people were living in the creek and living very comfortably there in 2-4 rooms.  Chimneys were of dry ware casks on some with others level with the ground.  Men who drank too much or who wandered about in the dark sometimes fell right through an opening into the room below.  Sometimes cooking food was forked from above and stolen.  He recalls the big flood that ended it all.  At the time 200 to 300 teams were at work between Burra and Adelaide moving goods at £2 to £2-10-0 a ton, though later the captain and storekeepers cut it to 35/- which caused a teamsters’ strike.  The centre of the strike was at Dan O’Leary’s Sod Hut Hotel.  Captain Chase led the strike and stopped teams at the Sod Hut camp.  Eventually he had between 80 and 100 there.  Storekeepers had to come out there from Burra to get their goods.  One day a man called Hobby, in charge of five teams belonging to Bell Freeman of Dry Creek, talked his way through to Burra on condition of no back-loading.  He broke his word and took a load back to Tothill’s Belt.  When about 150 men working at the Belt heard of his dirty trick they took action.  In the morning Hobby found himself 18 bullocks short and he spent two months looking for them, eventually he found three hides.  Eventually the strikers went into Burra and unloaded and proceeded to the ore floors to reload.  When Captain Chase appeared Captain Roach set four dogs on him, but the bullockies in turn set their dogs on Roach, who beat a hasty retreat to his office.

The roads were bad.  Hele had seen 12 and 13 teams bogged in a half-mile’s length – some with broken poles, broken axles and broken wheels etc. – especially at a place called Bald Hill.

‘Grissley Fred’ drove the mail in a two-wheeled spring cart pulled by three horses in tandem.  The mail contractor was Jimmy Chambers of Adelaide.  Mail was due to start at 6 a.m. from the Burra Hotel and up to five or six days was sometimes required for the journey.  Hele had seen the mail cart towed in behind a bullock wagon because the roads were so bad.  One night when ‘Grissley’ was taking passengers to Burra it was dark and wet and they got to a sticky spot that he thought he could get through, but actually only managed to get half way.  He asked the passengers to get out, but some objected.  ‘Grissley’ got down and unfastened the belly band and asked the passengers to sit back a bit and when they complied they found themselves suddenly in the mud and slush.  He answered their vows of vengeance with the comment it was his new way of unloading them when in difficulties.

Mr Hele is 70 years old and lives in Coward Springs.  [136 km west of Marree.]
