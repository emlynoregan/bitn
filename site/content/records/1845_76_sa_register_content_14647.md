Kooringa News, 29 May

Last Friday, Her Majesty’s birthday, was only partially observed as a holiday.  Most stores were closed, but the miners were at work all day.  The only event on the occasion was a tea feast for the Sunday school children of St Mary’s.  The church was decorated with boughs, flowers and a number of banners bearing suitable mottoes.  Outside the event was signalled with two large flags.
