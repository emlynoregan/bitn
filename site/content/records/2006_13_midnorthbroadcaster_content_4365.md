Letter.  Helen Edwards of Burra comments that rates in Burra are twice as much as those in Jamestown and as expensive as those in Adelaide, without the amenities of the city.  She also queries the situation of Paxton Square Cottages, when it seems 80% of the revenue was spent on salaries and wages, leaving little for maintenance.
