Burra Burra Show War Committee.

The object of the meeting said A.B. Riggs from the chair, was to see if it were possible for all the groups asked to attend to work together.

The Mayor was in principle behind the move, but was not sure what was required of the gathering.

Mr Warnes said nothing much was moving in the town and he thought the Red Cross Circle, FFCF and the Show Committee could work together.  The women had been active for some months and it was time the men got in and did a bit.  The idea of an ambulance or an aeroplane was just a passing thought and if any other thing was wanted then the money could be used for that.

Mrs J. Tennant said that the Red Cross Circle was only able to raise money for Red Cross, but individual members could choose to help the Show Society.  Red Cross was already raising money for an ambulance and if they couldn’t get enough would send it to headquarters for that purpose.

Mr Andrew Tennant said the FFCF was similarly controlled in what it could spend funds on.

The chairman thought it would be good for the Show Committee to help the Red Cross effort.

The Burra Show Ground is to be offered to the Commonwealth for the duration of the war, if they so desired it.

Election of officers for the Show War Committee: Patron, T.H. Woollacott; President, I.J. Warnes; Chairman, A.B. Riggs; Sec., M.S. Edwards.

Mr Riggs said they had so far received £441.

Mrs Tennant said the ambulance fund stood at £107 and the amount needed would be about £700.

The Show Committee resolved to donate £100 to the Red Cross Ambulance Appeal.

They also donated £20 to each of: Mt Bryan, Booborowie, Leighton, Hanson and Farrell’s Flat Red Cross Circles.
