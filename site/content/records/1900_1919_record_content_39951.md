Wherever his father worked there was a revival and in Burra there were 250 adult converts in a fortnight and 70 children.

Rev. Hall congratulated them all on behalf of the Conference.

Rev. S. Knight gave a short address.

Rev. J.H. Nield preached on Sunday and on Sunday afternoon the choral service The Rolling Seasons was presented.

In the evening Rev. George Hall gave a short address and Rev. S. Knight preached the sermon.

On Monday evening Rev. Henry Howard of Adelaide preached to a full church.

Much praise must go to Mr G. Dane for bringing the choir to perfection and to the organist, Miss Beatrix Pearce.

Burra Freemasons welcomed sir Samuel Way on Saturday afternoon.  He has at intervals since 1884 been Grand Master of the Masonic Fraternity in SA.  Some of the oldest members to meet Sir Samuel were P.M. Bro. W. West (Master 1875-6 & 1899) and P.M. Bro. H. Pinch (Master 1886).
