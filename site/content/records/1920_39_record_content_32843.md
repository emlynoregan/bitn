J.F. Hogan writes about a Back to Booborowie School held recently and incorrectly described as the Annual Prize Giving.  The function was advertised as free whereas a charge was made.  Mr Kesting took it upon himself to organise it, but the widely scattered former students are probably wondering why they were not given time and opportunity to attend.  With under two score old scholars attending the affair was an inglorious failure.  The middle of harvest is no time for such an event.  “Unfortunately the stupid attempt to hold a ‘Back to School’ on a few hours notice will, to some extent, take the gloss off any genuine and well organised effort to hold a ‘Back to Booborowie District’ movement.”
