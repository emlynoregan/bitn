(Continued)  Complaints that the cabs are not well maintained.  The Town Clerk is to write saying that unless they were placed in a more respectable condition their licence could be cancelled.

Complaints that constable Thomas in Kooringa was lax in his duty and unless he did more as required the Council would complain to headquarters.
