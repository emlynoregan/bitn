Obituary.  Mrs Elizabeth Gillett, of Gum Creek, has died.  Though ailing for some time, she only took to her bed about ten days before dying and the end was unexpected.  She was born 31 March 1832 and arrived in SA in the Oriana and married Mr H.J. Thompson of Gawler, who died when thrown from his horse eight months after the wedding.  They had one son, Mr Harry Thompson, who died when he fell down a well at Craddock in 1898.

Her second marriage was to G.B. Gillett of Salisbury at Trinity Church, Adelaide 28 May 1851.  She lived variously at Salisbury, Clare, Hill river and Gum Creek and finally at ‘Manilla’, six miles from Kooringa, for the last 22 years.  There were 15 children by the second marriage, of who four sons and four daughters survive: Mrs T. Turner (Hampton), Mrs E. Harris (Kooringa), & the Misses J. & F. Gillett who live at home.  Mr George Gillett (Momba Station NSW), Mr Alf Gillett (Hampton), Mr W.G. Gillett (Donugae), & W.T. Gillett at home.  Her husband died 2 July 1891.

[Born Elizabeth Wooley (sometimes Wolley) 31 March 1832 in Kent: died 28 June 1901 aged 69]
