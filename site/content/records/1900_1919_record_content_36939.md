Burra Cycling and Athletic Club Sports on Boxing Day were an unqualified success.  These had not been held for four years.  It was a clear cool day and this produced a record gate of c. £25 without 100 members’ tickets.  The results are printed.  The meeting was followed by a concert and ball at the Skating Rink.

Polo.  Burra visited Broken Hill over Christmas with a team comprising W.S. Murray, J.C. Killicoat, L.A. Lewis & G. Melrose.

First match: Broken Hill 7 defeated Burra 2

Second match: Burra 14 defeated Broken Hill 2nd team 2.

Third match: Broken Hill 3 defeated Burra 2.
