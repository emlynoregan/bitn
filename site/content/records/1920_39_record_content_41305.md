Mongolata Goldfield

The Byles’ Co. meeting at the Eastern Telephone Building last Thursday had Mr I.J. Warnes (a director) in the chair.  It had been decided to float the company with 100,000 £1 shares.  He called on Mr J. Richards to explain the company.  Mr Richards said Mr Greenfield, a Victorian expert had investigated the Byles’ Claim and Mongolata and his view was the field would turn out to be important and rich.  He (Richards) had been busy for eight months with the mine and he felt it could play a big role in the financial salvation of SA.  The company had an excellent and experienced miner in charge in Mr Salter.  Mr Francis O’Brien’s report in The Record of 9 September 1931 had been accurate when he had called the field a ‘miniature golden mile’.  The company had paid Mr Byles £1,000 on 23 December and had taken over the mine.  During his occupancy Mr Byles had got gold every day and the lode was still going on, travelling south to southeast.  It was hard to say how big it was.  They had obtained 165oz 8dwt 21gr of gold from 46 tons 9cwt of ore.  They had a dump of 300 to 350 tons awaiting a battery on the field.  Up to date the mine had paid for all development work.  If Charles Green’s report was correct there were 5,000 tons of ore in sight and that warranted a battery and water supply.  Mr Murphy an old miner predicted there would be 1,000 men on the field by the end of the year.  If Mongolata had been in Central Australia people would have flocked there.  Mr Warnes then gave an account of how he had bought his first share from Mr Richards.  Considering the difficulties the men worked under he thought the progress to date was wonderful.  The Government had not given the field the chance it should have had.  The lode seemed to extend easily for three miles.  He was pleased to be a director.  His first investment had been 3-£10 syndicate shares and he had sold one for £45.  He had put £300 more in the mine and was going to add to that.  He thought local businessmen should give support; that water was pretty close, but a battery was needed.
