Elder, Smith & Co.’s sale of land between Hallett and Booborowie for Mr D.S. Craig drew a very large attendance to the RSL Hall on Friday.  It was sold to E.M. Murray of Petherton, Mt Bryan, for £27 per acre and N.D. Tiver of Hallett, both of whom have adjoining properties and purchased the land between them.

The Quarry Paddock in the account of the Estate of the late R.F.E. Ford was bought by Mr T.H. Villis for £22-10-0.

The Jubilee Train visited Burra on Saturday and Sunday and long queues of people waited to enter it.  About 1,000 saw through on Saturday and 800 on Sunday.  There was more to see than time or the crowds allowed.  There were displays from the following Government Departments:
