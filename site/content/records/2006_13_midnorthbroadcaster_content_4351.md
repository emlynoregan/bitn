Burra Town Hall

A grant of $1,500 has enabled Roy Taplin to restore the old kitchen [1920s] at the Town Hall, to give visitors a glimpse of history.  The kitchen has been set up to reflect its appearance when in use.  Roy has also constructed a wall with a viewing window [showing the rock wall across the back of the Town Hall].  New lighting has been installed.  Heritage Advisor, Douglas Alexander applauded the work done and especially Royâ€™s input, when he signed off on the renovations and handed over the grant.
