Burra & District Ambulance Association has placed an order for a new ambulance.  A new Holden panel van will be converted.  The cost to the Association will be $1,800, including the $500 cost of conversion.

The Annual Mid Northern District Synod of the Methodist Church has been held at Hallett.  It was resolved to dissolve the present Synod and Crystal Brook, Gladstone and Jamestown will now join the Northern District.  Red Hill and Port Broughton will join the Yorke Peninsula District and Clare, Spalding, Hallett-Terowie and Burra will go to the Middle District.

While there was general dissatisfaction with the present system of religious instruction in schools, it was decided to continue for the present.

Tributes were paid to Mr Dunhill of Burra who, in September, will have been a local preacher for 75 years – surely a record term.

Mr W.L. Moore [Photo] has taken over a manager of the Savings Bank of SA at Burra following Mr D.F. Bannister’s transfer to Hindmarsh.

An Interdenominational Red Cross Service will be held at St Mary’s on Tuesday 23 August.  Mrs Lance Lines will give the address.
