Fire.  On Saturday last week J. Kelly loaded two bullock wagons for Oakvale and Pine Valley.  Mr N. O’Brien took the first and when they reached Frank Ford’s about three miles out, Kelly saw smoke issuing from the front wagon.  Woolpacks and chaff were alight.  A futile attempt was made to smother the fire and then in trying to unload it a rope was cut and O’Brien fell from the top of the load onto the edge of the dray breaking two ribs.  Mr Ford arrived and they got the load into his place where a hose soon extinguished the fire.  About £50 damage was done.  Mr W. Rule, who stopped at the incident, tied the wheels of his vehicle, but a passing car caused the horse to bolt and the vehicle was much damaged.
