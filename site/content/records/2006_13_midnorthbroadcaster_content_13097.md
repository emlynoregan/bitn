Merrie Elliott of Booborowie writes welcoming the news that the local doctor has her rights at the Burra hospital reinstated.  She thanks the efforts of the local group who fought for a resolution.  She feared there was a hidden agenda to close the hospital.  She expands on the work of the group and thanks them at some length for their efforts and stresses the need for the hospital to continue and the importance of being ever vigilant to see and counter threats to its doing so.
