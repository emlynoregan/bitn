Burra Town Council, 6 November

Complaints were received from ratepayers about dust from a newly ploughed up road in Market Square.  The Council said it was doing its best to minimise dust, but the road could not immediately be tarred.

Repairs to the bridge near Redruth Police Station and supports to the bridge near Gully’s are to be effected.

Once again a decision on spending money to be subsidised by the Unemployment Department was deferred.  The Mayor wanted a ratepayers’ meeting before deciding.  Cr Dow grew heated with the Mayor’s continual interruption of the discussion and moved that the Council adopt the Government Scheme to the limit of £25 of Council expenditure.  Cr Jennison seconded.  The Town Clerk advised there were funds in the General Account.  [The actual mechanism for getting money and /or rations seemed to be unclear to the Mayor and involved the approval of Sgt McDonald who administered the rations.]  Cr March said that Sgt McDonald would say who was to be employed by the Council.

[The Mayor wanted to wait for Mr Butler’s grant – whenever that was.]

Cr Dow said no borrowing was involved and asked the Mayor to put the question.

A discussion about rations followed and the Town Clerk clarified that men employed under the scheme could elect to receive either rations or money.  Eventually Cr March moved an amendment that the matter stand over until after the ratepayers’ meeting.  Riggs & March supported the amendment and Dow & Jennison were apposed.  It passed on the casting vote of the Mayor.

Crs Jennison and Dow protested strongly against the manner in which the Mayor had sought to influence the debate and force the amendment.

Cr Jennison moved the ratepayers’ meeting be held on 16 November.  The Mayor wanted longer to write his report and asked for 23 November.  The Town Clerk said his report was ready.

Councillors generally felt 16 November gave ratepayers a better chance of judgement before the elections and that date was carried unanimously.
