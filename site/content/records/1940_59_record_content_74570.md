Burra Hospital held its AGM on Tuesday night.

The Chairman Mr S.J .Woollacott reported major on-going difficulties in obtaining qualified staff and with book debts.  The physical condition of the hospital was excellent.  The Men’s Ward was completely renovated and repainted from floor to ceiling and three private rooms with adjoining passage were also repainted throughout.  The Casualty Room, Theatre and Sterilizing Room, Duty Room and passage were also renovated and painted, as were the Main Entrance Hall, Secretary’s Office, Pantry, Kitchenette, Dining Room and most of the hospital’s furniture.  A cheaper and improved sterilizing system was installed and a new dark room for X-Ray development was built and equipped and much new equipment was purchased.  Getting and keeping trained staff and trainees remains a problem despite the new Nurses’ Quarters.

The amount owing on unpaid debts is a concern.

The loss this year of W.J. Thomas is sincerely felt for the years of self-sacrificing work that he did.  The Chairman thanked the Board Members and the Ladies of the House Committee as well as the staff and the members of the various Women’s Organisations in the district who do so much to keep the hospital going.

The Medical Officer, Dr R.B. Pitcher, reported 340 patients for the year, with a daily occupancy of 12.  82 operations were performed, 63 babies were born and there were 13 deaths.

Dr Pitcher reiterated the Chairmen’s concerns over staffing.  He regretted the way in which several very capable and suitable Matrons have come and gone in a short time because they could not feel happy in the position.  He felt there was little awareness in the community of the high standing the position should carry.  It was an arduous job with little enough financial reward and the community needed to look after and support hospital staff, who arrived in the community as strangers.  If this is not done the hospital must close.
