Obituary.  The late A.B. Riggs.

Mr Alf Riggs was born in Burra 26 March 1881 and was engaged in the pastoral industry, while also taking a very active part in civic affairs.  After his education at Burra School he took the position of book-keeper with Drew & Crewes before joining his father and brothers on their Murkaby property east of Burra.  In 1913 he married Miss Myrtle Fuss of Aberdeen and they lived first at Murkaby before moving to Burra North in 1919 and in 1924 to his later residence on Smelts Road.  In 1924 he was also made a JP.  He was a Town Councillor for North Ward for several years before becoming Mayor for 1929-30.  He was also a member of the Burra Hospital Board and active in the Redruth Methodist Church, being a Circuit Steward.  He maintained a keen interest in the pastoral industry and was a member of the Stockowners’ Association of SA.  He was made a life member of the Agricultural Bureau and was an active committeeman of the Burra Show Society, and had also held the presidency.  He was actively associated with the sheep dog trials when they were held in Burra.  Mr Riggs had great interest in Burra Primary and High Schools.  He was a member of the Primary School Committee and later of the High School Council, of which he was Chairman for several terms.  Riggs House at BHS is named after him, in recognition of his years of service.  He was interested in most of the town’s sports, but most particularly in rifle shooting.  During WWII he was a member of the Fathers’ Association and secretary of the committee that farewelled servicemen.  He was a keen Freemason and was Master of all the Kooringa Lodges as well as treasurer for many years.  He was also a keen reader and served on the Committee of the Burra Library, where he was granted Life Membership.  He is survived by a widow, two daughters and one son.
