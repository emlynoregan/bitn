Richard Holbrook writes re the decision of Council that from 28 February the 1995 Committee called the Burra Tourist Association would no longer exist.  This committee comprised representatives from the following committees:

Burra National Trust

Burra Mine Museum

Burra Traders

The Lewis Board

Merino Capital

Mid North Tourist Association

Jubilee 150

Plus three members of the community and the Burra Burra DC representative.

The decision was made behind closed doors without consultation.  The Council does not seem to have considered that the move jeopardises the Passport Key.

Such action promotes a lack of confidence from the community.

Council says it has made the move in order to take ‘the next step’, but what that is lacks definition because they either cannot or will not answer questions put to them.

Restructuring of the tourism industry may well be needed, but what right has the Council to act unilaterally without consulting the people who form an integral part of the tourism infrastructure?
