Obituary.  Jane Gibbons died 11 August at her daughter’s residence (Mrs M.A. Kellock) in Kooringa.  She was the relict of the late Philip Gibbons and was aged 88.  She came to SA in the Pestongie Bomajee on 12 October 1838.  She lived for some years near Clarendon before coming with her husband to farm at Baldina just before the Mine closed.  Mr Gibbons died in 1881 and Mrs Gibbons remained on the farm until a few years ago when she moved to live with her daughter.  She had 10 children of whom 6 survive: Mr John Kemble (WA) [sic], Mrs William Kellock, Mrs M.A. Kelloch [sic], Mrs Fanny Kellock, Mrs Holman (Laura) & Mr H. Motherall (Hanson) [sic].  There are 51 grandchildren, 49 great grandchildren and 2 great great-grandchildren.
