The Burra Railway (From our correspondent)

The railways works here are in a forward state and are well ahead of contract time.  The next contract to the south is not so well advanced.  Four places are spoken of for the location of the actual terminus.

Paxton Square.

The Court-House allotments in Redruth.

An allotment close to the Special Survey on the Smelting Works Hill.

The Bon Accord Mine.

Paxton Square has the advantage of being right in Kooringa and this would increase the value of property there; all owned by SA Mining Association.  Unfortunately it would cost between £10,000 and £20,000 to bridge both the Burra Creek and Welsh Creek and to construct the necessary cuttings and embankments and it would not increase revenue at all.  North and north-eastern settlers would have to travel parallel to the line for three-quarters of a mile and then cross the creek to reach the station.  The two sites in Redruth share a good deal of the same disadvantages [though without having to cross Welsh Creek.]  The Bon Accord site lies at the junction of the north and north-eastern roads and there are no buildings there and so no town allotments to acquire and it is the nearest possible spot for the Burra Mine to which it could easily be linked by an inexpensive tramway.  There is an abundance of water and it is best located for the other towns like Copperhouse, Hampton and Nelson.  Experiences at Gawler and Kapunda suggest that such a location would not have a bad effect on the business centre in Kooringa.  The only disadvantage is that it would be three quarters of a mile from Kooringa.
