Mayor’s Report 1933

The depression continues with a low price for wheat and unemployment.  The Council sold unclaimed allotments and bought some land along the creek with a view of beautifying the same.

Finance began in debt £42-12-10 and ends in debt £78-7-2, but by 30 November this will be a debt of only £26.

The parklands saw further plantings on Arbor Day and Mr Thomas L. Wilkinson provided a report on the management of trees.

The Burra Brass Band returned with a cup from the Spalding Competitions.

The cemetery is being cleaned up.
