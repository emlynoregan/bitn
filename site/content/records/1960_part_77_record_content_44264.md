Burra & District Floral Art Club held its AGM.  Annual Report.

The club has grown too large for Mrs Allen’s house and has had to move elsewhere.  Financial members are 25 compared with 17 last year and the average attendance is 15.  The club now has a library and a store and the club was invited by the Burra Town Council to represent them at the Adelaide Flower Day.  The arrangement created by Mrs Lloyd and Mrs Pettet was so impressive it was recreated in May for the club’s Floral Art Display, which enabled us to donate $90 to the Burra Town Hall Floor Appeal.  During the year we made posies for balls throughout the district and flowers were arranged for the Miss Industry Ball in June, the Hospital Board’s Silver and Art Display at the Town Hall and at the Hospital for Christmas.  [Activities at meetings are also listed.]
