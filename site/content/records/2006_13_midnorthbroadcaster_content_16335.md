The ‘Midnight Oil’ House just north of Burra has become famous for the many photographs of it that have appeared across Australia.  Now this building that has become an icon of the Mid North is in danger of structural collapse after a rear corner of it fell down.  A restoration fund has been set up to save the structure.  While privately owned by the Stockman family it has become a most recognisable symbol of settlement in this area of SA.  The cottage dates from the period 1915-20.  Its image can be found at Adelaide Airport and at Dubai and in countless tourism and heritage promotions.  Bruce Stockman is the project facilitator.  Architectural advice urges stabilising the roof as soon as possible.  A local builder and mason have been organised and materials have been sourced, but funds are needed.  The building came to widespread notice after it featured as the cover picture on the Midnight Oil band’s Diesel and Dust album in 1987.  Donations can be made to the Burra Branch of BankSA to the Midnight Oil Cottage Preservation Fund.  [Photo]
