Burra Jubilee Benevolent Society AGM was held on 20 August in the Council Chamber at the Town Hall.  Elected were: Chairman, Rev. C. Christopher; Secretary, Mrs A.B. Riggs and Treasurer, E.R. Davey.  An active year was reported, but there were only a few active members.  Parcels of clothing and donations of money came in and before Christmas again a lot of eggs from W.H. Lloyd.  The chief aim of the society was to distribute wood in winter and Christmas cheer.  During the year the society lost through removal Rev. H. Hobbs & Lieut. Copley and gained Pastor Ashdown & Lieut. Bloxom [sic: for Bloxham] in their place.  The society will receive Â£100 under the will of the late Miss Wilhelmina Rogers.  [Report from Myrtle Riggs, Secretary.]
