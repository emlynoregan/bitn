National Biodiversity Month is September, so perhaps this would be a good time to give an update on the Pygmy Bluetongue Lizard Recovery Project.  We have found two new populations this year: one halfway between Clare and Blyth and the other at the top of Yorke Peninsula in the South Hummocks.  The latter is exciting, as it is the furthest west the species has been found and the property now has a sanctuary agreement on it.  The Blyth find is also significant in that it is near where one historical specimen is believed to have been found.  It was sent to a museum in Vienna late last century [presumably 19th century] and said to have been found at Seven Hills near Melbourne.  Since no pygmy bluetongue has been recorded in Victoria and there is no town of this name near Melbourne combined with the fact that the collector was known to have visited Clare, it seems likely it came from Sevenhill in the Mid North of SA.  These finds make it more likely the species may soon be able to be downgraded from ‘endangered’ to ‘vulnerable’.  Long term monitoring will have to be set up before this can be achieved.  [The article then goes on to call for volunteers to help in monitoring and describes the process involved.]
