Oddfellows’ and Foresters’ Sports on Monday.  By about 2 p.m. the Police Paddock grew busy and the morning’s warm and dusty conditions gave way to a clear and cool afternoon.  The grounds were well prepared.  There was a procession in regalia and with banners from the Institute about 10.30 with the Burra Band.  Sporting results are printed.
