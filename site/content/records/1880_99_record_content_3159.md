Accident.  On Friday evening a German farmer named Frahm, living east of Burra was returning home and was taking in his wagon a man named Spiller.  Near the end of the Nankivell’s Gully road Spiller fell out, but Frahm kept going.  When he met others further on he mentioned this and they kept a lookout for Spiller, who they found just recovering consciousness and with a severe head wound about 10” long from the wagon wheel.  With difficulty he was brought into Burra where Dr Brummitt attended him.  Frahm’s actions deserve the strongest approbation.

[Note that the next issue corrects this.  Spiller fell from a wagon of a farmer named Pilman and was on his way to work at Frahm’s, which is apparently how the error arose.]
