Frank Treloar: ‘Looking Back’

Reminiscences of the old mine.  In the past 52 years that the mine has been closed it has been stripped of anything of value except the well-built stone buildings and a few oddments.  He recalls the fire a few years before, which had burnt out Morphett’s Shaft and Engine House.  Johnny Green was to have been erected again, but so far nothing has come of it.

On the side of the rise was the ‘Lovers Seat’ now gone, from where many a conversation by ‘Echo’ was held with Johnny Green, but today it has lost its charm.  Further on are the dumps from the open cut – said to be valuable for their copper content.  To the left is Graves Shaft with its never-equipped engine room.  Across the gap in the hills are the Smelts and the conspicuous brick chimney up which a lad (Arthur Jordan) climbed years ago for bird’s eggs.  The bricks on the outside of the stack were made in Burra.  On the hill behind the ornate residence of the present Mayor [A.B. Riggs] there used to be a row of brick cottages known as Sunday Row because the need for them was so strong the men worked on Sunday.  Elias Wilks was born in Sunday Row close to 80 years ago.  Beyond to the left the fire brick kiln stood and alongside a good well that supplied water for Martin’s crushing works some 30 years ago.

Mr Treloar then talks of the very beginning of the mine when bullock carts could handle only 2½-3 tons.  Among the first officers sent up were Captain John Roach and Captain Bryan with S.W. Humble as storekeeper and H.M. Boswana who later gave way to Mr Burslem as surveyor and draughtsman.  Early houses were wattle and daub with paling roofs.  Kooringa was surveyed early.  People desiring an allotment applied to the resident accountant and if the Directors approved a block was allotted on 7, 14 or 21 year leases with a rental from £3 to £5 p.a.  The cost [of drawing up the] lease £2-2-0 to be paid by the applicant.  Business sites were dearer and never was freehold granted.  Consequently premises were makeshift until years later when they were glad to part with the fee simple.

In December 1846 land allotments were made to 20 applicants among them block 4 & 23 to the Wesleyan Church, 3 to Turton Diprose & 56 to Daniel O’Leary.

No. 3 is now owned by the daughters of the late John Pearce where before their home was erected could be seen traces of brick floors etc.  [Site of Leighton House in Chapel St.]

[Allotment 56 is the west corner of Hill St and Commercial St.]
