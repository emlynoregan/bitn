The Loyal Burra Burra Lodge was established in March 1849 with eight members.  In 1933 the Lodge Hall was built at Burra North and in 1945 it had 363 members and funds of £12,000.  It also had a Junior Lodge with 110 members and funds of £440.  [Note the story of the Oddfellows Lodge in Burra is much more complicated than this suggests.  There were two separate Lodges for many years – one that met in Kooringa and an Aberdeen Lodge that met until 1910 in the Lutheran Church in Redruth.]
