Burra Railway Station restoration project is nearing completion.  It began in 2007 and in 2010 secured $200,000 funding from the state government, with smaller amounts added in 2013.  Roy Taplin has been the volunteer project manager and has worked every week day for the last three and a half years, with some assistance from a small group of volunteers.  Generous quotes from local tradesmen have made possible re-roofing, tiling, plumbing and electrical work.  Roy has personally re-laid flooring and repaired woodwork and damaged walls.  He has painted the interior and parts of the exterior.  In 2013 he was nominated a SA Heritage Hero by the Premier Jay Weatherill.  Genosee & Wyoming Australia will transfer the lease of the station this month to the Department of Planning, Transport & Infrastructure. The intended use of the building is for display space focusing on the natural history of the region prior to white settlement â€“ a story not told elsewhere in the town.  To assist in covering running and maintenance costs the eastern end has been converted to a residence, suitable for a Bed & Breakfast venture and it is hoped the station will become a significant tourist attraction.  Use of the space has been negotiated with various groups and it is hoped they will install movable displays to enable flexibility in the use of the building so space can be hired out to raise funds for upkeep, along with the B & B.
