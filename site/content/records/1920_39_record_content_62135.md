Rabbits are in strong demand at present owing to a demand for fur following a fashion trend for fur in fabrics.  Angora hair became fashionable in luxurious fabrics, but cheaper lines used rabbit.  The skins were also in demand for trimming hats and gloves, in glue varnishes and even in gelatine lollies.
