The English & Australian Copper Co. has accepted a tender for deepening the approach to their proposed wharf extension at Pt Adelaide.  We understand they intend to increase the accommodation by 500 ft from the present frontage of 200 ft to the junction of the companyâ€™s property with St Vincent Street.  The new wharf will comprise a double row of screw piles 8 ft apart, backed by a dwarf wall of slag and concrete and decked 27 ft wide with Swan River jarrah.  Mr Blackman will supply the timber and Mr Anderson, an engineer, is on his way here to supervise the erection of the wharf.  The wharf will have a uniform depth of 18ft at low water.  The company intends to erect large warehouses on the wharf.
