Superphosphate Rationing.  The Government has given a farmer in the district permission to sow 200 acres, but superphosphate for 60.  Had he not received permission for 200 he would not have prepared the land and could have got some income for grazing on it.  In any case he has to sow 120 acres to meet expenses for the year.
