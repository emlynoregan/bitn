The Circle Theatre Company will be performing at Burra Town Hall on Tuesday 30 March as part of their country tour program.

Burra Community School

The land is being developed for the Agricultural Science course.  The vegetable area has been ploughed and will soon be fenced and surveyed into individual plots.  The car for Student Driver Education should be available within three weeks.  The response to Burra Schoolâ€™s first Community Week has been particularly good and most gratifying to the organisers and teachers.  121 adults have enrolled for the range of courses offered.

Year 12 students are in Adelaide for visits to Festival of Arts productions and Tertiary Education Centres.  Year 8 students are at camp at Barmera and Year 5 & 6 students are at Halbury Camp near Balaklava.  The absence of these groups makes it possible to accommodate adult students this week.
