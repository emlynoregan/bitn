The Wesleyan Quarterly Meeting showed that departures have affected church membership and attendance.  The district held 243 members and 368 scholars in Kooringa and Redruth with 150 elsewhere.

The meeting agreed to seek the division of the circuit:

Kooringa, Baldina and World’s End to be one circuit and Redruth, Westbury, Leighton, Davieston [Hanson], and Stony Gap to be the other.

A special effort was called for in the March quarter, to reduce the circuit debt of £250 and any balance left was to be made the responsibility of the Kooringa circuit.  The Glebe was to go with the Redruth circuit.
