Two Bren Gun Carriers visited Burra last Friday, under the charge of Captain P.J. Davis.  A large crowd assembled to see them in front of the Institute, including the pupils of the Burra Primary and High Schools and of St Joseph’s Convent School.  The visitors were briefly welcomed by the Mayor and Dr Steele.  Capt. Davis apologised for being about half an hour late because they had called at two or three small schools on the way.  The carriers had been manufactured at Islington of bulletproof steel.  They did not at present have a Bren gun mounted, but did have a Lewis gun in the centre and a machine gun used in air attacks.  They then gave a demonstration on the hill adjacent to the school, after which the Mayor entertained the visitors at morning tea.
