Drew & Crewes’ Building

The eastern wall of a storage shed at the rea of Drew & Crewes’ building collapsed on Friday after heavy rains – perhaps the result of missing guttering.  It was previously a storeroom for Drew & Crewes’ and then Bence’s.  Most recently it was tenanted by Off-beat Arts & Crafts.  Heritage advisor Douglas Alexander will advise on causes and a possible course of action.
