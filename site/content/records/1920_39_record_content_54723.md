CWA Ladies organised a Flannel Dance in the Institute on Wednesday 6 February.  The local Harmony Jazz Orchestra supplied the music (Messrs P.L. Rosman, N. Thorpe, A.W. Andrews & F. McGuire).  They wore their new uniforms for the first time: smart double-breasted white Eton coats with black facings and buttons and dark trousers.  As a result of the dance Â£11 was raised for the CWA Seaside Home Fund.
