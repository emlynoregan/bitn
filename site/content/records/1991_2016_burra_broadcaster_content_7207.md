SASSSA Cross Country Championship was held 6 June.

Conditions were wet and muddy, resulting in plenty of falls.  The best result from BCS was Jade Phillipsâ€™ second place in the U14 Girls.

Lee Jorgensen was leading in the first stage of the U% Boys, but was taken to Modbury Hospital with an asthma attack.

[Other results are printed.]
