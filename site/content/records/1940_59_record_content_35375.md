Letter.  ‘The Man Who Sees’ writes a rather long and somewhat tedious letter with rather oblique references to the milk situation and electricity lines.  He is more direct on the non-attendance of ratepayers at the meeting to discuss the loan for the War Memorial.  He does not agree with borrowing money for a War Memorial.  Money, he says, has always flowed freely for commemoration purposes and surely would do so again provided all information and matters concerning the needs were above board and the cards of information were placed on the table.
