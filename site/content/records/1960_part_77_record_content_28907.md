Burra Burra DC

The installation of a second-hand crusher should result in improved open surface roads in the district.

The resultant materials are more easily consolidated prior to the application of bitumen.  This has been seen in the Burra School approaches and sections of Smelts Road.

The Council investigated the use of a grid-roller, but this left two-inch stones embedded in the surface.  Initially the results were good, but subsequent grading saw this larger material ripped from the surface.  Trials using a ‘rock-buster’ also proved unsatisfactory.  A unit available at Penola proved to be the answer.  At Penola it was a fixture, but it has now been made mobile.  This second-hand crusher with modifications has been obtained for $7,000.  A new crusher of this type would cost $20,000 to$ 24,000.  Depending on the size of the stone required it can produce from 200 to 400 yards per day.  [The report goes on to give further details of its operation.]
