Victorian Gold

News with the Elizabeth says 39 men have returned from the diggings and those intending to return will not do so, we are told, till March because water has become exceedingly scarce and brackish.  Living there is very hard and expensive and dysentery is common.  A rest from the hard labour is seen as necessary for even the stoutest frames.

Many who intend to return will take their wives and families with them.  Three Germans who have come back are said to have acquired £75 each in a fortnight at Mt Alexander, where gold has been found in abundance.  The largest authenticated account gives the number of diggers as 15,000.

The Geelong Intelligencer of 6 December says the rate of extracting gold in the last few weeks would, if maintained for a year, yield £5,000,000 or half the annual produce of California.  It is not unlikely that within twelve months our exports of the precious metal will equal that of California.

[The Register continues to caution against going to the diggings; at least until March and gives some other details.]
