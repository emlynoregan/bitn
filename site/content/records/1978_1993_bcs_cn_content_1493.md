This drew over 50 local people and the guest speaker was Mr Roger Fordham.  Vietnamese people came from Adelaide and Auburn.  Mr Fordham outlined the historical background to the Indo-China refugee problem and his own experience.  He illustrated the talk with moving and disturbing pictures of the plight of refugees in camps.  No firm or binding resolution was passed, but those present came to believe that this community was able to solve all the physical problems if refugee families decide they want to live here.  A meeting to start initiating action will be held at BCS 30 October.
