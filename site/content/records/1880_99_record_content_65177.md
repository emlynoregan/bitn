[St Mary’s] Strawberry Fete and sale of Fancy Goods at the Institute last Friday was opened by the Hon. J. Lewis MLC at noon.  There was a large attendance in the afternoon and it was crowded in the evening.  The profit will exceed £60 and will be devoted to necessary repairs to St Mary’s.  The gramophone and music box were a treat.
