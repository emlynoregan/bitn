Quinliven built up the old horse and trained him.  Though looking worn, he could still gallop and he was entered in the Morning Star races in the handicap and he won.  He had at least another two wins at races at Tarlee and Hamilton, I think.  He then went to Adelaide for a Selling Race.

(On entering the selling price is given and in the event of a win anything over that goes to the club.)

Again the old horse won.

He was finally bought by the owners of Booyoolie Station and went back there to end his days.
