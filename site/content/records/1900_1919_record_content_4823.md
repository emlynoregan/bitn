Court Pride, Lodge celebrated their annual picnic at Mr W. Barkerâ€™s estate at Baldina on Wednesday.  Dinner was followed by sports.  The very hot day induced many to drink too much water and about 21 came home unwell as a result of too much water combined with bananas, cherries, lollies and the like.
