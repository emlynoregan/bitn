Weather

A savage storm smashed into Burra on Wednesday afternoon, 8 December and in just a few minutes, windows and skylights were smashed, premises were flooded and cars were dented in a sudden hailstorm.  Foliage was shredded and crops damaged.  Afterwards steam billowed from the hot road surfaces.  Burra SES and Burra & Mt Bryan CFS responded to calls for help and the MFS was called to Burra Hospital, which had lost many of its windows.  The storm crossed the state from Arno Bay on Eyre Peninsula, through the Snowtown area and on to Burra, before crossing the eastern pastoral district.  Winds in the Snowtown area were particularly strong – stobie poles were bent and a header was overturned and field bins blown about.

In Burra hailstones reached golf ball size.  Broken skylights resulted in flooding at Saltbush Clothing, Décor Made Easy, John Monfries’ office, Day’s Butcher Shop and the Doctor’s Surgery, the Commercial Hotel and the former Joe’s.  Elsewhere hail blocked gutters and drains, causing water to enter the Art Gallery and Burra Community Print.  The immediate crop damage in SA was put at $2.5 million, but this figure seem sure to rise.  An area south and west of Burra seems to have been hard hit.  The floodwaters closed the Burra-Robertstown Road until 10 a.m. Wednesday.  Floodwaters washed stones across the Burra-Morgan Road for a distance of 15 km from the Robertstown turn-off to near the start of ‘The Gums’ property and these had later to be swept off by workers.

At David & Robyn Nourse’s a large in-ground swimming pool was just being lowered into position as the storm struck.  Two men in the hole fled rapidly as the pool was quickly lowered to stabilise the situation.

Sharyn Roberts tried to save her car by driving it into Elders’ merchandise area, but a skylight there fell in and hailstones came through the hole.  Damage is assessed at $4,200.  Glasshouses at Gerald Pens’ farm were smashed and about ⅔ of Thorogood’s apple trees were affected.  At the Catholic Church water ran down the hill and spouted from the drain holes in the front wall, almost to the centre of Market Street.  At graham & Judy Kellock’s galahs were killed by the hail and magpies were injured.  Many cars were dented or lost windscreens.  The hail loosened paint from the underside of verandahs in Commercial Street.
