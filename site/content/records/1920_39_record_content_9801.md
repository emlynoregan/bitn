14 free subscriptions to the Institute were awarded.

Miss Manser was presented with a Xylonite mirror, brush and comb set.

Mr Wade received a pipe, tobacco & pouch and a silver-mounted oak tray from the Boysâ€™ Club, of which he had been secretary.

The Burra Hospital Christmas Tree & Concert was organised by Miss Sandland for the staff and patients on 19 December.  As usual it was held out of doors and was a great success.
