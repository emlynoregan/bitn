Mr Lang and the Kooringa Representation

Letter from William Lang RM, MD to the Hon. the Colonial Secretary, 13 March 1851.

You have probably seen in the Adelaide papers the requisition calling upon me to stand in the coming election.  I have accepted the call to stand for the Burra District in the Legislative Council.  I am not aware that my position as the Resident Magistrate of the Murray District is any impediment to this course, but it seems to be desirable that I should ascertain my proper footing.  I therefore ask you to obtain the opinion of the Law Officers on this point and would be obliged by your favouring me with it at your earliest convenience.

[Lang then cites other cases that might have some relevance to this question.]

Letter from Charles Sturt, Colonial Secretary, to the Resident Magistrate, Burra Burra, 21 March 1851.

I have the honour, by the Lieutenant Governor’s direction, to inform you that you are of course quite at liberty to follow your own judgement in this matter; but that, as the Lieutenant Governor holds your residence at the Burra to be indispensable to the proper performance of your official duties, His Excellency will consider you to have vacated your office of Resident Magistrate by an election for a seat in the Legislature.

William Lang RM, MD to the Hon. the Colonial Secretary, 28 March 1851.

As I never contemplated the alternative of your reply, I have ceased to be a candidate, and the independent electors are now looking out for another.

[Lang goes on to outline why he considered that a seat in the Legislature would not have been incompatible with the carrying out of his duties as Resident Magistrate.  He also outlines his qualifications and experience in England that would have fitted him for the role.]

‘For myself personally I have no interested purpose to answer; no paltry ambition to gratify; and I can assure you with great truth I do not at all regret that I am relieved from a position which would have been attended with much trouble and anxiety.’
