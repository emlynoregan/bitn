Criminal Sessions

Joseph Worth was charged with stealing 15/- from John Foulds at Kooringa on 22 March.

Foulds said he was with his friend William Tighe at the Smelters’ Home Hotel on 26 February.  Foulds said he ‘grew stupid’ and left to lie down near his dray.  Tighe lay down nearby.  Foulds had 15/- in cash and c. £17 in cheques in his pockets.  He awoke in the night hearing someone say he was robbed.  He felt in his pocket and found his money was gone, but he felt so sick that he went to sleep again.  In the morning Tighe had told him he had taken the cheques and placed them at the police station for safe keeping.  He did not think Tighe had been drunk on leaving the hotel.

William Tighe (a pork butcher) confirmed Foulds’ evidence and added that he had seen the prisoner take the money from Foulds’ pocket.  He had tackled Worth who had either kicked him or struck him with a stick, cutting his forehead.  Worth had then run away.  Tighe followed and they fought, but knowing Foulds had cheques in his pocket, Tighe had returned to secure the money.  He had seen Foulds receive the £17-12-2 from the Patent Copper Co. that evening.  Tighe had been about 18 months in SA, having come from Sydney.

William Bayley, waiter at the Smelters’ Home also offered corroborative evidence.

Archibald Kirk was employed with Worth at the Patent Copper Co.  He confirmed the evidence concerning the struggle between Tighe and Worth.

Acting Sergeant Reid corroborated Tighe’s evidence about handing over the cheques and also gave evidence about Worth’s arrest.

The jury found the accused guilty.

George Chadwick gave Worth a good character reference.

Because it was a first offence the Judge gave him three months’ hard labour.
