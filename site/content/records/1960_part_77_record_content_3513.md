Lawns have been sown in front of the Wing and the Nurses and Sisters’ Home and about 30 trees planted.

[Presumably ‘Wing’ refers to the Maternity Wing.]

The Women’s Organisations have again been active and have handed over £550.  This assisted in renovations to the Sisters’ Quarters at a cost of £1,200 – for which Government subsidy has been promised.

The Hospital Auxiliary has also rendered valuable service, especially in repairing bed linen etc.

Since the close of the financial year the hospital has received a bequest of £399-15-0 from the estate of [the late Mrs Clare Ethel Gare].  This will be devoted to capital improvements and so attract a two for one subsidy.
