Burra Town Council, 20 July.

There is a report that 120 trees are needed to fill in gaps.

Applications for the position of Waterworks Engineer are laid on the table.  It was resolved that none be accepted, but that Council would examine their credentials and select three for the recommendation of the hydraulic engineer.  Messrs Work, Roberts & Smyth were chosen.

A motion for a call of council to be made to reconsider the motion of Cr Lockyer of 4 May re concession of excess water, was lost.
