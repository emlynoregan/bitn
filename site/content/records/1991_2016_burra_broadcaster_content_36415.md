Burra History Group

Meredith Satchell and Eric Fuss write on behalf of the group to outline its aims of preserving the written and photographic history of the district.  They list the projects of the group:

Development of an extensive district family database.

Summarising over 100 years of the Burra Record.

Collection of information on the more than 600 men and women of the district who served in WWI and to extend this to WWII in the near future.

Collection of obituaries about people with town and district connections.

Digitising the historic photographs of Burra & district.

Collecting the writings of Frank Treloar – the district’s most significant historian before Ian Auhl.

The establishment of a website offering a wide range of information of interest to family history researchers and visitors to Burra.
