Obituary.  Mr A.L. Walker, a well-known Burra resident, died suddenly at his home in Kingston Street on Friday afternoon.  Although he had not been well for some time, his death was unexpected.  He was born in Burra 70 years ago and was a son of the late Mr & Mrs J.T. Walker.  In 1907 he went into partnership with his late brother Osbert, and acquired the business trading as Walker & Sons.  He was in charge of the drapery section.  He was active in town affairs, serving on a number of committees over the years.  For some 20 years he was secretary of either the Burr Primary School Committee or the Burra High School Council.  For a long time he was also Secretary of the Burra Seaside Picnic Committee.  He was a keen worker during the Burra Centenary in 1945 and supplied much of the information in the souvenir booklet of that event.

[Alfred Leslie Walker, born 4 July 1877 at Kooringa: died 16 January 1948, Burra.]
