Burra Hospital secretary-manager Mr J. Chilton criticised a discussion paper on obstetrics and neo-natal care written on behalf of the Government steering committee by Dr S. Britton.  This suggests the cutting of these services at Burra.  Mr Chilton said two babies would have been delivered on the side of the road in the past year if the services had already been cut.  He has called on the community to rally round in an effort to save the services.  He feared that if the neo-natal services go it would have a snowball effect and result in the loss of the doctor.  Then a decline in nursing and chemist services would ensue.  He feared the transfer of accident and emergency services to Clare.  The nearest hospital to the east was at Waikerie.
