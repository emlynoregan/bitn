Burra High School.  A tender has been accepted for improvements to the sports area.  Hirschausen Bros will lay two tennis courts and two half cricket pitches with chain mesh surrounds.  Plans for Jubilee Celebrations are in hand. Arbor Day was held on Friday with speeches by Messrs E.T. Baulderstone & K. Hicks and trees were planted.  The furniture for the new laboratory has arrived â€“ all that is needed is the building.
