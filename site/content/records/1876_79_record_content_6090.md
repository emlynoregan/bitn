Aberdeen Bridge. It is some time since the Aberdeen Bridge was condemned and a new one ordered. The old bridge is now unsafe for heavy traffic and the new ironwork has been delayed by the strike at James Martin & Co. in Gawler. A ford will be needed while the bridge is replaced and it might as well be done now for the benefit of heavy traffic.
