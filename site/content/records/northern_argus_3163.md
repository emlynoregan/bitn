Adelaide & Wallaroo Fertilizers Ltd held a board meeting in Burra on 7 October.  Board members inspected the Burra operations.  Managing Director Ian Gemmell said the company had approved a $7.5 million investment in mining and processing operations at Mt Gunson, Copley and Lyndhurst.  The mining project team led by Nick van Buuren had met a demanding schedule, bringing the mining and processing into production this week.  Almost 50 people were employed at Mt Gunson and this secured the future operations at Burra, which employed another 40.  Most of these 80-90 people came from the Burra district.  Over lunch the board met a number of local guests, many of them were farmers.  Mr Ken Williams, Chairman of the Board, was able to tell them of recent changes in fertilizer and agricultural product activities.  The company was changing from a South Australian supplier to a national supplier of fertilizers and was entering an exciting period of growth.
