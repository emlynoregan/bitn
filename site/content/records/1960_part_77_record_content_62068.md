Burra Burra DC, July meeting.

Mr R.J. Jeffery was re-elected Chairman.

From 15 July admission for children attending Burra Pictures will extend to all those attending school to the end of secondary school.

Aberdeen Oval: the Council is still unhappy about the behaviour of some attending the football there.  They are still driving across the oval.  There have also been reports of young drivers doing wheelies on the oval surface.

The tender of G.R. Pearce for alterations to the Council Office has been accepted and work has begun and should be completed before the Copper Festival.
