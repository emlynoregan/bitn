Dr Ashton interjected to ask whether the Board ever called for a report.

Mr Winnall said that the Board always believed that Doctors were there to advise the Board on any matters and they do not have time to send for a report.  What the Board asked was for the Doctors to attend meetings to see what is needed and enable the Board to deal with matters.

The Board has never interfered in substance or in fact between the Doctors and their patients in the legitimate workings of the institution.

Had the public had as full a knowledge of the facts as the Board, then the representation to the Government would have been very different.  There are many more inaccuracies floating around the town.  The resolution of the meeting is asking a good deal in demanding the Board resign without a hearing and that Dr Ashton be reinstated without hearing the facts.  The reasons which actuated their resolution are puerile.

It is also asserted that the reports of Board meetings are incomplete and unsatisfactory.

The trouble began in August 1913 and on the 13 April 1916 there is a minute that the press be admitted to meetings.  Until then they had not attended and the secretary gave them a report.  The reports since 13 April 1916 are in the hands of the press and nothing to do with the Board.

As for training nurses.  The Board wrote to the Australian Trained Nurses’ Association and they told us to carry on as usual.

Mr Winnall then returned to the cases in 1913 that seem to have initiated the trouble with Dr Ashton.

He read from a Board minute of 15 August 1913.

Matron reported that a patient (Terry) had left the hospital and returned under the influence of drink.  Dr Ashton reported that while he was out Terry had called on him and complained that the nurses had neglected treating his leg.  Matron and Nurse Dorrington were examined with the result that the charge of Terry being intoxicated was sustained and the charge of neglect against the nurses lapsed.
