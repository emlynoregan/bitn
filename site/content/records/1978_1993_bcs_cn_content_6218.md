Burra Burra DC

The Victoria Park Wall

Council considered the future of the wall and decided to demolish it except for the wall and return near the entrance and that part in the south corner adjacent to Smelts Road together with approximately 20 metres dividing the oval from the old Small Bore Rifle Range.  The Small Bore Range area will be converted to parking area.  Quotes will be obtained and funds sought for the wall repairs.  Photographs will be taken of the wall to be demolished for historical reference.  Council is considering the installation of a plaque to detail the wallâ€™s historic significance.

The Bicycle/Pedestrian Path continues to be illegally used by some motorists, motor-cyclists, horse-riders, etc.  The public is asked to report any such use directly to the police.

Extra seats have been installed in the town and along the creek funded by Mrs R. Jennison (2) and one each by Mrs R.J. Jeffery, the Aberdeen Croquet Club and the Burra RSL.

Mid North Regional Tourist Association has arranged for regional tourist attractions to be pictured on 2,000 dozen West End Export beer cans.  Burra is included among others.
