G.S. Kingston writes an address to the Electors of the Burra.  Major points in a very long piece:

The Legislative Council has been dissolved to go to the people on the subject of an amended Constitution.

I remain a sincere friend of civil and religious liberty.

I am opposed to class legislation and the nominee element in our present Constitution.

I voted for the Land Regulations that were intended to ease the obstacles that prevented the discoverer of minerals from benefiting from his discovery.  The question of the Constitution to be laid before the new Council has been published in the Gazette Extraordinary at the equally extraordinary hour of midnight on 17 August.

The colonists have for years demanded responsible Government and the abolition of the nominee element in the Legislature.

Instead the Governor offers what is essentially a continuation of the present system.  The executive will not be able to be dismissed by a vote of no confidence.  It is intended that the official members of the Legislature shall have the same tenure of office as at present, namely, the will and pleasure of the Governor for the time being.

The just rights of the colonists must not be made a matter of bargain and sale, not must responsible government be withheld from us to suit the personal interests of three or four officials.

I have hitherto been opposed to a two chamber Legislature.

But it is imperative that we secure responsible government and control of the Land Fund without delay.

In 1853 the price for control of the Land Fund was agreeing to a nominee Upper House for life.  I thought the price too high.

The position now has changed.  Reading the despatches of Lord John Russell indicates that we must accept a proposal within the Act of 1850.  This Act allows one chamber with one third nominees or two chambers, both of which may be wholly elective.

The Lower Chamber, I believe, should have the widest possible suffrage consistent with careful registration.  Residence for six months being sufficient.  Electorates should have as even a number of electors as possible.

I would also afford voters the security of the ballot.

I think the Upper House should be elected by the whole colony voting as one district for the entire number of members to be elected.  One third of members to retire at each general election.

Should you wish again to have me as your representative, I would be most willing to serve.
