Governor General, Mr Bill Hayden will be in Burra this coming Friday to unveil the four restored S.T. Gill watercolours owned by the Burra Burra DC.  He will visit heritage sites and present commemorative medallions to student representatives at BCS.

The Gill paintings, recently restored by David Button, are now said to be worth about $80,000.  They have not been on show for many years and depict the mine and town between 1847 and 1850.
