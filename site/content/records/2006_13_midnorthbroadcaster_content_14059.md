Wind Farms

The debate continues.  A group of locals expressed their concerns recently on a Channel 7 news segment.  The group wants all proposals deferred until all complaints have been investigated.  Some Waterloo locals are also complaining about interference with radio and television signals.  Mary Morris of Buchanan says the noise from the Waterloo wind farm can be heard up to 10 km away depending on wind conditions.  One farmer 4.5 km from a turbine has moved to Kapunda in order to get some sleep.  Another has moved to Saddleworth.  Larger turbines than used at Hallett are due to be placed within 4.5 km of the township of Burra.
