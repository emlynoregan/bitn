Burra Town Council.

There is a report from the Crown Lands Office that the decking timber on the Commercial St Bridge is all more or less decayed.

A.C. Noyes has tendered his resignation as an auditor on account of bad health, so creating an extraordinary vacancy.

Commonwealth of Australia.  The SA Government has announced that nothing will be done to celebrate the birth of the Commonwealth.

Burra Slag Extraction Co.  In a terrible accident on Monday night E. McCann was caught in the rollers.  His left foot was caught and torn from his leg: the boot and part of his foot going between the rollers.  He was at once taken to the hospital where his left foot was amputated about three inched above the ankle.  He is progressing as well as can be expected.  Mr McCann was only recently married.

[Probably the Edward James McCann who married Annie Allen: check the marriage.]
