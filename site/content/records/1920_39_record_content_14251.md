Edwin Pearce sued Mrs Daphne Kakoschke for £45-10-7 being the balance of an account owing for goods.

E. Pearce agent of Aberdeen and formerly a storekeeper trading as Boz Pearce said the defendant had on 27 January 1923 agreed to the transfer of an account for £62-10-7 then in the name of her husband Gus. Kakoschke, from his name to hers.  She agreed to pay £1 per week and payments had continued till June 1923.  [The transfer and subsequent complications over the issuing of receipts in her husband’s name etc. seem to have stemmed from a desire to avoid him seeming to have a debt problem when he had just started business as a butcher.]  Mrs Kakoschke denied any such arrangements, but her husband when called as a witness admitted to the conversation setting up the arrangement and a verdict for the amount claimed was given.
