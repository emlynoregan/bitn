The Seventh War Loan.  Up to Monday evening the Town & District Council areas had promised about £31,000 and the target of £50,000 seemed a distant prospect, but on that evening Messrs A.J. & P.A. McBride decided to contribute £17,500, which enabled the town to carry the burden which in relation to other quotas was so unfairly placed upon it.

Other contributors in excess of £1,000 are:

C. Bartholomaeus	£4,000

C.B. Warnes	£3,000

H.H. Thomas	£2,000

£1,000 each comes from Elder, Smith & Co., T.H. Pearse & Sons, J. Tennant & T. McWaters.

In surrounding areas Hallett trebled its quota and Mt Bryan doubled it.  It seems that Booborowie, Apoinga and Hanson will reach theirs – in each case their quota was £5,000.

By last evening the district total had reached £53,000, but there are not more than 150 subscribers, so a large number of people have not realised their responsibility and duty yet.
