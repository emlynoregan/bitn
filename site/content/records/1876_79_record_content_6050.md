Accident. F.R. White's horse bolted on Monday morning as he was taking it out of the wagonette*. The gate blew open and scared it. The trap* passed over Mr White's foot and knocked against Mr Snell's verandah post where the harness gave way. The trap was considerably injured, but no people were. [*This variation in terminology within a single report in the paper was common. Trap and buggy in particular were interchangeable terms.]
