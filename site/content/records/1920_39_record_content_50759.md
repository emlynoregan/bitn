Sister E.M. (Nellie) Winnall [Eleanor Manley Winnall] has recently returned to SA from overseas to live with her mother Mrs W.B. Page.  She is the daughter of the late J.E.H. Winnall and was born at Burra where her father was a solicitor.  She began her nursing training here.  Later she worked abroad in connection with the Overseas Nurses’ Assoc. in such places as London, Ceylon and Newfoundland.  For the last two years at the latter place where she found the inhabitants to be uneducated and very superstitious.  Miss Winnall was not working at one of the two hospitals on the island, but served a district among the small harbour settlements in the southwest and north.  The nearest doctor was seventy miles away by water and she had no special nurse’s quarters and no motor car.  She dispensed all medicines required in her small surgery fitted up in one of the houses where she lived.  In summer she travelled to her patients in a small boat and in winter she was taken to homes in a sleigh drawn by Labrador dogs or small horses.  One visit saw her taken sixteen miles in three hours by five dogs.  Some winter travel was across the hard frozen sea.  Her duties included those of a public officer, welfare worker and veterinary surgeon.  She said the chief food was white bread, black tea and molasses.  Potatoes and cabbages were grown.  All milk came as condensed milk, as there were no cows and she created great interest by importing a goat.  Trade in the small harbour towns was by barter, exchanging fish for flour etc.  In such places there was no currency.  The locals did not travel and there was no compulsory education and no sanitation.  When an epidemic breaks out it just spreads.  The towns varied greatly: some were clean and fresh and others filthy and uncared for.  On the whole she said the people were not sturdy because of intermarriage and malnutrition.
