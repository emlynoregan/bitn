Burra High School Speech Afternoon was held last Tuesday.

L. Carthew, headmaster, received the visitors.

Rev. Hewitson as Chairman of the High School Council presided.

The school had opened in 1924 with 39 students, 17 of them new scholars.  Ten of the 13 students from Burra Primary School who had gained a Qualifying Certificate had continued.  Average attendance for the year was 34.

In November for the first time a student had sat for the Leaving Honours Exam and Dora Rosewall had gained one subject.  Clifton Pearce gained three Leaving subjects.  Madge Pearce gained seven subjects in Intermediate and Intermediate Certificates were completed by Harold Denton, Lillian Piggott, Pattie Pledge & Lindsay Thomas.

Miss Forss has done good work in the Domestic Arts Centre.

In sports Clare visited us and won the tennis while Burra won the cricket.  Later in the year we visited Clare where Clare won the basketball and Burra the football, but a return visit in September saw Clare win both football and basketball and in December they also won at tennis and cricket.

Ground is being levelled at the back of the schoolyard for tennis and basketball courts.  Lillian Piggott and Murray Stockman won Dr Steele’s prize for an Empire day’s essay.  Thelma Morton wrote the best original article for the school magazine and Maude Riggs was designated the most diligent student.
