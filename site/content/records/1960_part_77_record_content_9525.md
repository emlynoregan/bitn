Murray Cod.  Messrs Kevin Flaherty and Albert Hempel landed a 60 lb Murray Cod at Cadell last Wednesday, The previous biggest cod known to have been landed by a Burraite was one of 54 lb by Bob Cummins, who took the title from Johnny Hill with a 46 lb fish.  [There is a photograph, presumably with one of the above men, but not so named, with the fish.]
