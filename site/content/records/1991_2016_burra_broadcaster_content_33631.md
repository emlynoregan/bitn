Princess Royal Feedlot

The owner of Princess Royal Station, Simon Rowe, says there will be no increased traffic along Ayers Street in Burra as a result of the proposed feedlot on the property.  Plans for the lot have been put out for public consultation by Goyder Council.  Trucks will use the Old Adelaide Road entrance.  Some local residents of Ayers Street have started a petition asking for a load limit on Ayers Street.  Jenny Carter says that heavy commercial traffic to and from Princess Royal has been increasing for some months.  The application before Council does not make clear what route the feedlot trucks would take.

Roger Cross, who owns two properties on Ayers Street, has lodged an objection to heavy traffic such as B-doubles using Ayers Street, saying that their vibrations would damage old cottages along the street with earth foundations and also the miners’ dugouts.  There would also be dangers for children, pedestrians and cars passing trucks on the narrow road.  Des Woolley, another resident of the street, says it is too narrow and too lightly built for the mass of vehicles the proposal would generate – added to which, he fears that much of the traffic would be nocturnal.
