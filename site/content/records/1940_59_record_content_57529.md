Electricity.  ETSA is not willing or not able at present to extend high tension lines from Waterloo with effort concentrated of servicing Radium Hill.  The local company is reluctant to dispose of its plant and lines cheaply, either to the Council or to ETSA.  Meanwhile local housewives look enviously at others who can enjoy the luxury of an all-electric home with stoves etc.  The local domestic user and employer both suffer from the effects of the high price of local power.  A solution would be for the local company or the Council to buy in bulk from ETSA, but the £50,000 cost of the line from Waterloo is the stumbling block.  The cost to Council would be more like £70,000, as they would have to acquire the local transmission lines.  The question is whether people in Burra would buy enough electricity to justify a Council borrowing £70,000.
