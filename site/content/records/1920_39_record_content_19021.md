Porter’s Lagoon.  The syndicate getting a boat for the Lagoon met at H.C. Atkin’s on Thursday and the boat has arrived at the Farrell’s Flat Station.  A picnic sports is planned for next Saturday at the Lagoon.  H.C. Atkins will launch the boat and it will be christened by Mrs Atkins.  Mr Borowsky is arranging for refreshments.  Several sideshows and other attractions will be present and accommodation for bathers.

A letter from ‘A Reader’ follows on, claiming that ‘the boat on Porter’s Lagoon had already turned in revenue to the extent of 10/- for hire.  It must be getting quite popular with the crowd’.  And all look forward to the new venture on the Lagoon next Saturday.
