Redruth Court, 5 December.

H. Austin fined £1 + £1-16-0 costs for allowing pigs to feed on uncooked offal.

Charles Price fined 5/- for being drunk.

Edith Thompson fined 5/- for being drunk and 5/- + £1 costs + 2/- cab hire for resisting arrest.

When M-C Skinner tried to arrest her at c. 9.30 p.m. in Kingston St she lay down on the road and a cab was sent for.  She said she had been to Bald’s for some supper and had had a bottle of ginger stout with her husband.  Then M-C Skinner came across and interfered with them.  Skinner said she at first had said she wouldn’t go and then that she would if her husband could get her hat, but the couple could not find the key to the door and Thompson had got in through a window.  He then offered his wife a brown hat, but she wanted one he couldn’t find.  He opened the door and the defendant rushed in.  Skinner followed and then the door was locked, trapping him inside with the pair and their dog with a reputation for fierceness.  The defendant was screaming and yelling and the stand-off continued to c. 10.40 when a cab passed and Skinner called to T. Halls.  The defendant then got into the cab.

Archibald Thompson corroborated his wife’s version of supper, but said he had put his arm about his wife when Skinner came across and threw her off the footpath onto the road and put his foot on her chest saying, ‘I’ve got you.’  When she asked if he would allow her to get her hat, Skinner had replied ‘I’m damned if I will.’  He drew his baton and held it over his wife, saying ‘If you move I’ll drop you.’  Thompson said his wife did not throw herself down.

Archibald Thompson was also fined 5/- for hindering M-C Skinner in the execution of his duty.
