The Douglas Methodist Church.

[The following letter is of importance, as except for the advertisement that prompted it there seems to be no other references to the closure of this church.  It is also a rare indication that the building was also used for the Thistlebeds School as the writer implies there was a school there in 1905, which strongly suggests the Thistlebeds School.]

The Douglas Church

To the Editor,

Sir,	I see amongst the advertisements in the Burra Record that tenders are being called for the sale of iron etc. from Douglas Church, and I say it is a very unnatural procedure.  Why not instead, call tenders for the improvement of the building?  I would like to know by whose authority such a step is being taken? I also wish to inform those who are ignorant of the fact, also those who appear to be so, that our mothers and fathers, by voluntary subscription, had this church erected both for their own benefit and that of future generations.  What would they think of the people of today (who are supposed to be wiser than they) if they were to see Douglas Church not as it should be (improved accordingly) and nothing but a heap of stone and refuse.  Again about 15 years ago this building was used as a day school as well as a church and about 30 children received all the education they ever had or ever needed.  I wonder if the person who authorised the present situation has ever benefited from the above?  Does only one generation exist in the surroundings?  Is the district deserted? Are there no inhabitants?  Have they no children to be educated?  Most decidedly so.  At present there are about 12 children of school going age.  Are they to grow up ignorant? No!  Rather would some send their children to board so that they would get their education.  Others have governesses in their homes, whilst others, rather than have their children absent from them, forfeit maybe a prosperous future in relinquishing their farms, as they consider it secondary to their childrenâ€™s necessities.    I think the trustee (as I believe there is only one at present) should have called a meeting of the people in the near vicinity before acting like this, as, although it is rather neglected, the property is valuable.  Rather procure help to make the building double the advantage it proved to be in years gone by.  As this district is badly in need of both a church and a school I strongly protest against this structure being ruined.  Yours etc., Herbert Morgan.
