Letter.  L.J. Sullivan of Hallett writes to congratulate Burra on being such a good host to the New Zealand girls and their crews and at the same time show casing Burra and district to the media.  Not only did the show provide some fun and excitement, but it also injected some well-earned money and prizes into the community.

‘What a contrast to the few peddlers of negativity some of us have had to read in recent days.’
