Obituary.  Mr William Byles died at Burra Hospital on 24 December.  He was the eldest son of the late Mr & Mrs Jesse Byles and was born at Emu Downs on 11 March 1866.  As the son of a pioneer he assisted his father from a very early age and ay 9 years old was shepherding sheep on the roads.  Later he was contracting in the back country northwest of Broken Hill for some time.  He was working on Mr Gibbs Station when Broken Hill rose to prominence.  He then moved to Broken Hill for five years.  On 31 December 1891 he married Miss Eliza Morgan, daughter of the late Mr & Mrs John Morgan of Baldina.  The ceremony was performed by Rev. Daddow.  In 1911 Mr & Mrs Byles left Broken Hill and purchased a farm at Ironmine where they carried on grazing and farming until 1925, when they sold up and came to reside in Burra.  His genial and unassuming manner made him many friends.  His wife had been a true help-mate and her death in 1940 was a great blow to him.  He suffered a long illness with patience and courage.  Of a family of seven children four sons and one daughter survive: Phil Byles (AIF Loveday Camp), Alick & Frank Byles (Wanilla Station, Pt Lincoln), Walter Byles (RAAF, Geraldton) and Mary Mrs Bettison (Cummins).  Two daughters predeceased their parents; one [Edith Florence] in infancy and one [Ellen Gladys] in 1935.  Two sisters also survive; Mrs Joe Dixon of Farrell Flat and Mrs Mickel of Eudunda.  [William Charles Byles born 11 March 1866 Tothill’s Creek SA.]
