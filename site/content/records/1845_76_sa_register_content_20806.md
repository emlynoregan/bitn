Railway Meeting at Chinkford [Chingford - later Manoora]

A large crowd assembled in poor weather on 19 June in the barn of Jabez Frost, Park Mill, to consider the proposal for a railway from Forresters to Burra.  Arthur Colemann JP was voted to the chair.

[As might be expected the arguments here were somewhat different in emphasis from those at Burra.  Here the chief argument was that the appalling roads meant they could not get produce to markets.  And cartage costs were too high.  Poor roads meant cartage had to be done when possible and not when the market was at its most favourable â€“ cartage took as much as 25% of the value of produce.]

The first resolution said the line was most desirable.

The second stated that the general depression in the north and the great surplus of labour was chiefly caused by the high transport costs, which the railway would remedy, making it highly desirable that it be constructed immediately.

The third resolution urged the benefits of building it in various places simultaneously.

The fourth resolution urged that the Forresters-Kooringa line take precedence over all others.

The final motion called for the adoption of a memorial similar to that sent from Burra.

All were passed without dissent.  [Much more detail is reported.]
