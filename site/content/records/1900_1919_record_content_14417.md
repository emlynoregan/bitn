Burra Mine

Our mining reporter visited and found Mr Pryor preparing a set of timber for the mine.  He went past a few tributors at work to reach the drive.  The exposed ore body is smaller than before, the lode having turned northeast.  The men have driven quite 20ft on the line of the lode.  The urgent need for machinery is very evident.  Without it opportunity is being lost.  Thousands of tons of milling ore are being passed in the drive and it is clear a concentrating plant would give handsome returns.  Many pounds worth of ore has now been placed at the mouth of the old shaft where it has been hauled up.  From all appearances the future of Burra will be one of prosperity and it is to be hoped that arrangements for the long looked-for machinery will be speedily made.
