Brenton & Dee Greenslade will hand ‘Gaslight’ over to new owners at the end of April.  They consider they have achieved the goal of their ten year plan in seven years.  They have built up a high quality coffee shop, offering also books and collectables.  Among regulars they can cite Mike Rann and partner, Sasha Carruozzo, Graham Gunn and Peter Goers.  ‘Lonely Planet’ and ‘Let’s Go’ travel guides list it as highly recommended.  It has picked up two regional tourism awards and an SA Great business award.  [Photo.]
