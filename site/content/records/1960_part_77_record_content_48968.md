Burra High School Speech Night was held in the Burra Town Hall on Tuesday night.  Dr D.C. Paul was guest speaker and Mr & Mrs Roy Jeffery presented the trophies and prizes.  [The prize list is printed.]

The Headmaster presented the school’s 57th Annual Report.

[He welcomed the guest speaker who was Senior Lecturer in Education at Salisbury Teachers College and also Mr E.C. Allen MP.]

The year opened with 180 students, an increase of 12 and there were eleven staff members, of whom seven were newly appointed to Burra.  I came from being Deputy Headmaster at Kadina.  Mr Moyle came from Murray Bridge, Mr West, Mr Salt, Miss Russell, Miss Pfitzner and Miss Strahan were appointed from college.  Mrs Brand was part-time librarian from the start of second term.  At the end of second term we lost the services of Miss Strahan due to illness and she was replaced by Mr Fisk, a recent arrival from Canada.

Paving of the school grounds remains in a shocking state, but we hope for improvement shortly.  Work was begun on a retaining wall around two of the tennis courts, but although begun in September, it is yet to be completed and in the meantime half of the court surface is broken and useless.  The grassed area is in good condition.

The Parents & Friends’ Association has been active and very helpful this year and many thanks go to the President Mrs Matthews.

[School visitors and speakers are then listed, followed by a report on internal sporting activities.]

Last year’s Leaving results were disappointing.  The average result of Grade IV or better was 63.4% compared with a state average of 75%.

The Intermediate Examination was held for the last time and Burra did very well with a Grade IV or better result reached by 85.9% of subjects compared with a state average of 75%.  Especially noteworthy were:

Lynnette Griffen	7 subjects and six at Grade 1 level

Neville Hyde	7 subjects and five at Grade 1 level

Angela Quinn	8 subjects and four at grade 1 level

David Francis	7 subjects and four at Grade 1 level.

In this year’s Leaving Class seven students held scholarships and recently it was announced that Ann Brak has won a Commonwealth Scholarship.

The failures would seem to be less a lack of ability than a lack of drive.

[The Headmaster then went on to discuss the division of students into different tracks corresponding to differing abilities and interests.  He also discussed promotion for the first three years of High School on the basis of continuing assessment.]

Staff changes at the end of the year:

Mr Brand has been promoted to Deputy Headmaster of Willunga High School.

Mrs Day has decided to resign.

Mr Johnson has been transferred to Taperoo High School.

Mrs Fisk (formerly Miss Wilkinson) has been moved to Nailsworth Girls Technical High School.

Mr Fisk also leaves.
