Burra Town Council

Council intends to reclaim a portion of the cemetery.

For some time now the question of reclaiming a portion of the cemetery has been debated by Council.  Although the period of the leases of 99 years has expired on the majority of blocks in the central portion of the cemetery, certain legal questions needed to be checked and permission obtained from the attorney General.  This has now been completed and Council is now prepared to clear and reclaim this part of the cemetery.  This is required because at the average rate of burials the cemetery will be filled in two or three years.  Any person holding a block with an unexpired lease in this area is asked to contact the Town Clerk, Mr Holness – the block numbers to be cleared are listed elsewhere in this paper.  As well as making more blocks available, this move will also make the area clean and tidy.

[Page 2 had a list of block numbers involved: 542 to 699, 704 to 753 and 758 to 1,271.]
