Madge Harper, a former waitress at the Bon Accord Hotel was charged with a breach of the Masters’ and Servants’ Act.  [This seemingly trivial case ran for 1½ columns.]  Harper had a counter claim for wages.  The evidence reveals that the waitress’s wages at the time were 17/6 a week. Witnesses were Thomas A. Gregg landlord and his wife Catherine, Ethel May Gully, in service at the hotel, and Mary Lillian Jones, assisting at the hotel.
