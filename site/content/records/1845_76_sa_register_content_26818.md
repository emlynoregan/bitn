Kooringa, 27 October.

The stoppage of the Callington Mine has seen a large increase in the mining population here.

An entertainment was held at the Institute last night in aid of the Church of England Parsonage Repair Fund.

[Details are given.]

Business is still brisk both in Kooringa and at Aberdeen.
