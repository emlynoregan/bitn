‘Wanderer’s Farewell’ W.H. Hardy writes to complain that he is being excluded from the paper ‘by party motives’ and ‘on account of my fearless and otherwise hot references to the hypocrisy of certain money-bag would-be leaders of the people, whom it is to your interest not to offend, free speech is being stifled.’

‘I am sick of the cant which runs through society today.  Hence my plainness’

‘I know . . . some of our respectable persons . . . have stamped me as low and gutterish.’

[He signs himself W.H. Hardy and so removes his disguise: though both style and content must have made it very clear who he was all along.]
