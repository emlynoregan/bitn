Burra Town Council, 5 September

Councillors debated the need to reduce the general account overdraft and eventually voted to reduce ward funding by £130.  West Ward was in the best position to do with less, as most of its roads are low maintenance, bituminised streets.  It starts the year in credit c. £14, whereas East Ward is c. £20 in deficit and North Ward has a deficit of £3-£4.

Last year East Ward got £210, West Ward £180 and North Ward £160.

Cr Dow & Cr Robinson felt each ward should contribute £50 to the General Account.  Cr Lott said it was all right for West Ward Councillors to be so generous, but they had bitumen roads that were easy to keep in repair.  He couldn’t see how East Ward could do with less than £180 with a bridge soon needing repair.  East Ward could agree to a reduction of £30.

Cr Dow moved a reduction in ward allocation to £400 (from £550) to be divided pro rata.

Cr Lott moved an amendment that the allocation be £430.

Cr Dow said make that £410 as West Ward will give £50 anyway.

For: Dow, Robinson, McWaters & Jeffery.  Against Lott & Samuel, the East Ward Councillors.

Cr Jeffery then moved the division be North £130, East £180 and West £130, because £110 too little for North Ward.

This amendment was carried with voting the same as for the motion.

[Since this adds up to £440 and ward funding in 1937 was £550, it looks to me a saving of £110 rather than the £130 stated in the headline.]
