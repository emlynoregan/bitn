Burra Hospital Board.

A.J. McBride was re-elected as Chairman.

Dr Steele sent a letter from France.

There was some discussion on accounts for patients and on unsatisfactory egg supplies from Drew & Crewes.

It was decided to wait for instructions from the Government before taking any actions as a result of the Board of Enquiry.  For the same reasons the signing of the agreement with the Local Board of Health was deferred.

With four months to go the hospital had spent £940-6-1 of its £1,000 annual grant.
