Mr John Rowe is 84 on Thursday.  He was born in Adelaide on 4 May 1860 and reached Burra by himself in 1874.  He got a job with Mr Tom Lamb at the original Burra Hotel (now the hospital).  For most of his life he has been a drover with much experience at Paratoo, Mutooroo & Teetalpa Stations and also in WA.  He went to WA in the gold rush and when Paratoo was subdivided in 1897 he bought a mob of 20,000 sheep to Burra for Elderâ€™s.
