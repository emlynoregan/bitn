Letter from R.J. Fairchild condemning the new Width of Tyres Act which reduces the carrying capacity of vehicles from 9 cwt to 8 cwt, but since the same loads have to be transported will do nothing to help the state of the roads.  It is merely an extra burden on the taxpayers - farmers and teamsters.  The car tax should go to the local government to aid road construction and maintenance.
