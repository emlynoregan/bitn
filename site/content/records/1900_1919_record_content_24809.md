Burra Town Council, Monday

H.E. Rabbich is to be asked to keep his sheep out of the avenue and plantations, as a number of young trees have been destroyed.

25 pepper trees are to replace dead trees in the plantation near Messrs Roach & Sons.

W. Harris was appointed curator and sexton of the cemetery & Mr Thomas’s resignation was accepted.

The Hopkins Fund has reached £265-6-11.
