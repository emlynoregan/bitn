Soldiers’ Memorial.  On Tuesday a meeting of the Executive of the Burra & District Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial Fund was held.  A number of competitive designs were laid on the table.  The number was reduced to four with a strong leaning towards one that was particularly striking and the most suitable architecturally for the site.  Mr Crewes has been deputed to get fuller details from the designer.  About £900 is in hand.
