Editorial on another fiasco at a Council meeting where Cr George Parks moved that the Council express dissatisfaction with the way th e Record reported the Council meeting of 17 July.

‘Councillor Parks has come to us before now and asked why we gave Councillor Linkson so much space.  Well, we replied, as soon as we recovered from the shock, that the first named councillor said something, and he said nothing.’

‘If the so called errors were pointed out to us in a proper manner and we found that we were wrong we would have been pleased to make all necessary corrections, but to move a motion in the Council similar to the one which seen [sic] light on Monday evening and expect us to keep dumb on the matter is beyond the endurance of human nature.’
