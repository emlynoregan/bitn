Morgan-Whyalla Pipeline

350 men will be working at pipe making plants at Morgan and probably also at Gulnare, Pt Pirie and Pt Augusta.  400 more will be needed carting and laying pipes and associated work.  The favourable report on the tinplate industry will make jobs for 1,750 men for two years and permanent work for 2,000.  Most work on the pipeline will be between Morgan and Burra where the heaviest concentration of pumping stations will be.  Both skilled and unskilled labour will be needed.
