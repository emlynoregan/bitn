Frank Treloar: Looking Back (Concluded)

The directors reported making a clear profit of £9-0-4 per ton and the average cost of 18 months tonnage of 9,839 tons was £6-11-4 with an average profit of £8-9-10 per ton, or £81,786 or 442½% p.a. on the capital stock.

27 October 1848.  Mr Young made an offer to take copper ore via Gulf St Vincent – marking the start of the Gulf Road.  Mr Young was a surveyor.

20 November 1848.  An extraordinary meeting of directors was held to consider the offer of G.S. Walters and Mr Williams of the Patent Copper Co. for smelting of ore on the mine property.

The main points of the arrangement were:

The seven year agreement was to begin with the start of smelting c. April 1849.

The copper ore was to be delivered to the Smelts by the mine.

Smelted copper was to be delivered to the mine by the Patent Copper Co.

Details of returnable quantities etc. are given.

The Patent Copper Co. was not to sell any copper in SA or the colonies.

Precious metals extracted were to be equally divided.

The quantity for the first year April 1849-April 1850 was 10,000 tons.

In successive years it would be 30,000 tons if the mine produced as much.

The site for the Smelts, cottages etc. was to be leased for 99 years.

The directors approved the proposal.

4 November 1848.  A 100% dividend was declared.

18 April 1849.  AGM of SAMA.  Copper prices in Europe were depressed.  Discoveries of ore were improving.  The lode in 30 fathom level was red oxide and malachite in great abundance.  An 83 h.p. pumping engine had been carted to the mine.  An engine house was being erected to enable work at the 30 fathom level.  The Patent Copper Co. had begun work a fortnight before.

17 October 1849.  At the half-yearly meeting new discoveries continued to be reported.  They were then employing 727 including officers. The Patent Copper Co. was delivering copper regularly.

3 August 1849.  The eighth dividend of 100% was declared.

[If this number is correct then that of 18 August 1848 was the sixth and not the seventh and that of 4 November 1848 was the seventh.]

17 August 1849.  Tenders were called for the sale of the first copper smelted at Burra: 13 tons at £77 per ton in any quantities.  The secretary’s salary was increased to £500 p.a.

7 September 1849.  It was suggested to Mr Walters of the Patent Copper Co. that he apply for the survey of a town at Pt Henry (i.e. Pt Wakefield) of say 40 acres.

14 September 1849.  Captains Roach and Bryant examined land to the west of the special survey and it was resolved to buy 1 area that afterwards became the Karkulta Mine.

16 November 1849. The 9th dividend of 100% was declared.

5 January 1850.  Copper was at £75 a ton.

22 February 1850.  The 10th dividend of 200% was declared.

8 March 1850.  Mr Challoner’s salary was increased to £180 p.a.  Challoner and Roach were now running the mine.

17 April 1850.  Copper prices improved in Europe.  The directors resolved to order powerful pumping machinery – to be the big engine for Sneider’s Shaft [sic: Schneider’s]

15 May 1850.  The 11th dividend of 200% was paid.

16 October 1850.  The Chairman said the ore raised in five years was 56,428 tons.  SAMA in 4½ years to 29 September 1849, including 4 years of the Burra Mine, earned a profit of £229,535-8-9 and of this £221,760 had been paid in 12 dividends:
