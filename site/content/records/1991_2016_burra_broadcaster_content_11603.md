Letter.  Michael Barry, consultant writes to clarify a point from the Burra Council Amalgamation meeting, reported in the issue of 23 October 1996.

‘Rate Savings Linked to Loss of Services’ fails however to convey the main focus of the meeting.

The article seemed to imply that I said that the four councils seeking to amalgamate would reduce services if they implemented rate reductions.  This is not the intention of the four councils.  Their intention is to reduce rates overall by 3% in the first year after amalgamation, while maintaining services.  My view however, is that experience shows that rural amalgamations at best produce modest savings because:

Most rural councils already have little fat to cut.

All councils face increasing demands for new and improved services through State Government regulation and removal of services as a result of their cost cutting measures in rural areas.

Some of the savings will need to be diverted to specialist staff to tackle these new or improved services.  If greater rate reductions were required in rural councils, then that could only come at the cost of reductions in service levels.
