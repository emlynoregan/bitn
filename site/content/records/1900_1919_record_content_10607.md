The Reformatory Girls

Agnes Dykes and Martha Learmouth were recaptured by M-C Grosser about four miles southeast of Hamilton at about 4 a.m. on Wednesday.  They were curled up asleep in the back of an Afghan Hawkerâ€™s van while he slept across the front.  Grosser had followed the trail of the two red-headed girls through Black Springs and Waterloo.  They had worn out their shoes in rough walking and were barefooted.  They were taken 14 miles to Marrabel barefooted and there the landlady at the hotel gave advice and helped them put their shoes on.  They continued to the train at Saddleworth and thence to Burra and the Reformatory.  They claim to have escaped by scaling the wall and though this is scarcely credible they will not say anything to involve anyone else in their escape.
