Terry Wilson: Editorial

The RN 3870 road past World’s End has finally been sealed and gets its grand opening this Friday at 2.45 p.m. where the Burra Road enters Robertstown.  This sealed link brings the Goyder Community closer together.  Robertstown is now the same time away from Burra as Clare.

The Gawler Council has approved the naming of the highway from Gawler to Kapunda, Eudunda and Morgan as the Thiele Highway.  Four separate Councils need to approve this initiative of a SA Tourism Commission Working Party.  Goyder has already done so.
