Burra Community School Students and those from Robertstown School planted 152 trees at Worlds End section of the Burra Creek Gorge earlier this month.  It was part of a project by the Native Vegetation Council to revegetate the south side of the creek adjacent to the camping ground.  The Burra Creek is a biodiversity hot spot and the creek forms an important habitat corridor between two large sections of remnant vegetation in the Burra District.  Among the many species living there is the diamond fire-tail finch, which is listed as vulnerable.  The project is funded by an NVC grant of $100,000 and is managed by the Regional Council of Goyder and the SA MDB NRM Board.
