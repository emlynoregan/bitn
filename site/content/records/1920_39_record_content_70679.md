Obituary & Inquest.  An infant female child of Veronica Jean Smith was born near Mt Bryan about 15 April.  Two or three hours later it died from having its throat cut.  An inquest was held at Redruth Coroner’s Court with Mr A.B. Riggs as coroner.  Police had interviewed Veronica Jean Smith (who said she generally took her step-father’s name of Nourse) at the Burra hospital on 16 April.  She said she would be 19 on 21 April.  They told her they were making enquiries into what had happened at Quinn’s the day before.  They had found a newly born baby with its throat cut in a bag in the pit of the lavatory.  Smith had told police she had given birth the previous day about three hours before Mr Quinn had got up.  She had cut the baby’s throat, but was in a terrible state and didn’t know why she had done so.  She had not seen the baby move and didn’t know if it was dead or alive.  She had cut its throat, put it in a bag and thrown it into the lavatory about two or three hours after birth.  Mrs Quinn had seen her coming out of the lavatory with a knife in her hand.

Dr Stevens examined the girl on the 14 April and believed she had given birth within 24 hours.  She had then denied the fact and claimed to have done so about two months earlier.

Mr Quinn communicated with him later and he re-examined the girl who still said she had not given birth recently.  Later he and a police officer had been present when an old bag containing the body of a newly born infant was pulled from the lavatory at Quinn’s house.  A post mortem established that it was a full-term female baby, well developed and that death was due to a knife cutting the throat.  The child had been alive at the time of the wound to the throat.  [Details are given.]

[Dr Steven then gave evidence of mothers’ reactions to birth and to mental stress at the time.]

Margaret Quinn, wife of John Lawrence Quinn, said she had known and employed Jean Smith as Jean Nourse.  She had not noticed anything that would suggest she was about to become a mother, but on 14 April Jean had complained of backaches and appeared to be ill in the evening – she then gave evidence about noticing blood on the floor in the morning and seeing Jean go into the lavatory.  She was a long time and Mrs Quinn went to see if she was all right.  Jean emerged with a butcher’s knife with blood on it in her hand.  Jean explained the blood as nose-bleeding, but Mrs Quinn thought it looked too dark.  About 9 a.m. Mr Quinn took her into hospital in the car.

Mr Quinn gave evidence which added only a little to Mrs Quinn’s, but after talking to Dr Steven at the Hospital he had returned home and found the bag in the lavatory by lighting some paper and dropping it down.

Veronica Smith was committed for trial on a charge of murder.

[The child’s death is registered as an female with surname Smith, given names not recorded, died 15 April 1938 at Mt Bryan aged 3 hours.]
