The Steam Ship Burra Burra

We understand that Messrs Hall & Co., the proprietors of this fine screw-steamer have appointed this day for a trial trip and that the Burra Burra will leave the wharf at 11 a.m. precisely, returning in the afternoon.  It is said that numerous invitations have been issued and that the party of excursionists will include many of the principal merchants and leading colonists.
