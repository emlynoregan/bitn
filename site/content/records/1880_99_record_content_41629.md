Burra Institute, Meeting on Federation, 5 June.

Messrs Holder & Lake MPs addressed a good audience ‘which included a few of the gentler sex’.  The Mayor, W. West took the chair.

Mr Lake was glad to see the ladies taking an interest.  He felt the Bill from the Federal Convention was to a great extent fair, but could still be improved. Tariffs between the colonies would be swept away and this would mean much for SA as the great Barrier traffic would be opened up directly to SA without customs duties.  Murray waters were another question that federation would settle.  Posts and telegraphs would become federal.  Money borrowed should come more cheaply.  He favoured the title of Commonwealth.

Mr Holder spoke for about 1½ hours.  He discussed the importance of interstate free trade.  ‘We needed a federation which was not unification, and which yet had in it sufficient completeness to form a basis for national growth.’

Most of his time was spent in going through the Bill and showing how it would operate.  He eulogised Mr Kingston and Sir S. Griffith who had done the bulk of the drafting.  The State’s Rights party had secured a large measure of success for its cause, though the rights of the two federal houses were not equal as they should have been.  The Senate, unlike the local Legislative Council would not represent a class, but a whole people.  It was important that the Senators be chosen by the two houses of the State Parliament sitting as one body.  If the two houses sat separately and chose a proportion of Senators each then a popular election would be better (on a state-wide basis).  The elections for the Lower House are proposed to be on the same basis as those for the lower house elections in each colony.  This means that some will have restricted suffrage and plural voting and this must be changed.  If it were all or nothing for the present Bill he would be for none of it, but he hoped there would be amendments and then another convention to draft a final constitution.
