Woodville CEBS visited at the weekend and camped in the parish hall.  50 boys attended.  There was a chop picnic on Saturday afternoon at Old Koomooloo.  On Sunday they attended a sung Eucharist and visited the old brewery cellars on Mr Bill Youngâ€™s property.  [Although the paper describes them as wine cellars.]
