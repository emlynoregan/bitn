CWA, AGM was held last Friday with Mrs Warnes in the chair.  Mr Charles Wilkinson had been placed at some inconvenience by allowing the large room at the rear of his stationery shop to be used as the rest room.  Mrs J. Morrison has now offered a room at her home situated behind Mr Benceâ€™s shop with other privileges and the members agreed to accept this offer.  A minute of appreciation was recorded for the kindness of Mr & Mrs Wilkinson with a letter of thanks sent to them.  Elected were President, Mrs I.J. Warnes; Treasurer, Mrs J.S.W. Coles; Hon. Secretary, Miss Minnie Rogers.
