Kooringa News, 12 September

The new Telegraph Office is at last finished and the instruments were transferred to it from the Miners & Mechanics’ Institute last Monday.  The building, while putting forth no vain pretensions to architectural effect, presents a very prepossessing appearance.  It is commodious and demonstrates good workmanship.

The annual celebrations of the Redruth Primitive Methodist Sunday School were held last Sunday.  On Monday the children walked in procession through the township and afterwards the usual tea and cakes were enjoyed in the chapel.

The anniversary of the Loyal Aberdeen Lodge MUIOOF was held yesterday with the usual procession and dinner.  The procession went to the Primitive Methodist Chapel where a sermon was preached by Rev. Whittaker.  About 150 attended the sumptuous dinner at Lamb’s Aberdeen Hotel.  [The toasts are reported.]
