Flood Fund

Goyder Council has secured more that $6 million to repair roads and infrastructure damaged by recent flood events.  This was confirmed at a meeting in Eudunda as part of the Ministerâ€™s road trip to meet the Mayors and CEOs of flood affected councils.  Minister Russell Wortley presented a letter to Mayor Peter Mattey, confirming the long awaited good news.  The $6,357,200 would be paid in two equal instalments, the first in the 2011-12 financial year and the second in the 2012-13 financial year.  It is expected the program of work to repair damage to roads, watertables, floodways and stormwater infrastructure will spread over four to five years and will involve sourcing additional skilled labour and contractors to supplement the council workforce.
