St Joseph’s School students have been raising funds for their Sports Day on 6 September.  Afternoon tea and stalls will also raise money for replacement desks.  The school has been established for over 60 years and the desks of that period are no longer in accordance with the school’s needs.

Mt Bryan School held its Arbor Day in 15 August.  Trees were planted in the school grounds and competitive sports held in the afternoon.
