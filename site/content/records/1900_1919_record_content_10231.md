T.P. Halls is the oldest cabdriver in Burra.  He started in the business about 17 years ago with Mr D. Morrison and subsequently drove for Mr S. Hall and later for Mr Charles Schutz.  Later still he and Fred Bromley bought the business from his previous master Mr Hall (no relation).  Then when Fred went to work in Broken Hill T.P. continued the business.  He is now 34 years old, but big enough to be much older and had the strongest voice on the line.  [He was actually 39.]  He was born in Thames St in the old house next to F.J. Careyâ€™s, but it has now fallen into ruin, the wall only remaining.
