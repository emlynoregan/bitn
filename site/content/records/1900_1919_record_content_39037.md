Redruth Court 12 September.

Thomas Halls was charged with using indecent language.

The charge arose out of a fight between Thomas Rosewall and Copeland.  Copeland accused Rosewall of coming around to his house while he was away.  George Lines was also present.  The fight and the offence took place at Bagot, Shakes & Lewis’s sale yards.  The evidence report employs a great many —’s.  Halls promised to sign the pledge if treated leniently, saying it was his first offence since a 1912 assault.  He was fined £5 or two months in jail.

Thomas Rosewall faced the same charge, but was ejected from court as he was apparently drunk.

George Lines was also charged and seems to have changed his plea from not guilty to guilty in mid-stream.

Samuel Copeland was called but failed to appear.

The report then rather oddly says Halls and Copeland were each fined £2 or 14 days with £3-2-0 costs and Rosewall £5 or 1 month with £1-15-0 costs.

[Perhaps there was a second charge for Halls in this somewhere.]
