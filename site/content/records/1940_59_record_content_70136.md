Grasshoppers

On Wednesday the Advertiser reported a meeting of pastoralists at Burra on the grasshopper plague.  It says some 120,000 square miles are infested, extending from 25 miles northwest of Terowie down to the area of the Morgan DC.  Mr Hawker MP asked the Minister of [Local?] Government whether, as in the case of a fruit fly plague, some assistance might be given, as they were beyond the capabilities of individual landholders to control.

The Hon. A.W. Christian replied that the Government was not prepared to go beyond the supplying of free poisons or baits, as provided for in the Act.  Landholders must apply themselves to the destruction of pests wherever they appear on their properties.

Mr Hawker said that was a physical impossibility.

Hon. A.W. Christian said Government Officers were inspecting the area to check on reports.  He also thought some of the reports were exaggerated.  Landholders were obliged to pinpoint egg beds and notify the appropriate authorities and then to start destruction programs.

The Minister also said the Government would see that the Waite Research Institute did research into onion weed and Cape Tulip.
