R. Caldwell MP’s Visit to Burra, as reported in the Mt Barker Courier.

He had a guide who reminded him that in the past many people once lived in the creek banks, that trees were unknown and there did not used to be a good water supply.  After floods the copper company supplied lodgings ‘in the form of unsightly rows of attached cottages and a huge five-chain square block of land was built upon, without an intersecting lane on all sides but one.  A sadder sight in a country town does not often meet the eye of a person who knows anything about the requirements of humanity.  In the meantime not more than 10 per cent of the places in Humanity Square are inhabited.’

Elsewhere however he noticed ‘Genteel residences and artistically-designed villas . . . surrounded by ornamental trees and beds of flowers and shrubs.’

He then mentions the school which he asserts must have cost between £12,000 and £15,000 and to be capable of holding 1,000 children, but attendance has never exceeded 300.*  The Institute was imposing though the height of the hall he thought out of proportion and three feet lower than it ought to have been.  Though this may be just his eye at fault since it was designed by Mr R. Rees MP CE.

Mr Holder as Mayor showed him over the old mine and gave information on municipal affairs.  The population is estimated to be between 2,000 and 3,000 and on a low assessment the Corporation income amounts to about £850.  Streets and footpaths are in a very creditable state.  The mine he likens to the crater of a volcano with crater walls 120-150’ high and the water depth he says is 60 fathoms.  There were two powerful pumps, one of 20” and one of 16”.  Thirty men at the time of his visit were said to be making wages working through the upper levels and carelessly examined debris of the old mine.
