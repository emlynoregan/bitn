Burra Celebrated Youth Week last week.

Various affairs raised funds for improvements to Victoria Park.  Unfortunately the procession and sports on Wednesday were not the financial success they should have been, perhaps because they coincided with the Jamestown Show and the Marrabel Rodeo.  There was a fair attendance at the Youth Service in the Burra Town Hall on Sunday.  [An outline of the service is given.]

The Tuesday Childrenâ€™s Frolic in the Burra Town Hall was successful.
