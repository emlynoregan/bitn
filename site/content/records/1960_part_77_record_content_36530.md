Mt Bryan School students had an excursion to Peterborough (40 students and 20 parents).  They visited Mr Bradtbergâ€™s poultry farm where they saw kangaroos, emus, deer, cockatoos, Cape Baron Geese and several types of duck.  They also went to the Northern  Meat Packing Works and the Peterborough Railway Workshops, which included a ride on a locomotive for seven or eight children at a time.
