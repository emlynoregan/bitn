Redruth Methodist Church has decided on a change of name.  In future it will be known as Burra Methodist Church, Redruth Circuit.

At a report of the Quarterly Circuit Meeting it says the new circuit name will be Burra-Redruth Circuit.  Permission was there given to close Westbury Church for three months, as the building is in a bad state of repair.  The last three active families have agreed to go to Redruth.
