Phoenix Copper has begun a drilling program covering four sites in SA: Princess Royal, Mongolata, Spalding and Burra Central.  The program will extend for about six months.  A 600m drill hole is planned for the Black Hill Prospect in the Mongolata Project area and two 200m deep drill holes are planned for Burra North about 800m north of the Monster Mine to test strike extension of mineralisation there.
