Obituary.  Mrs Penrose died at Kadina 16 December 1927 aged 81.  She was the mother of Mr L.S. Penrose of Kooringa and lived in Burra as a girl.  She was born in London in 1846 and left for Australia with an uncle and aunt in 1854, arriving early in 1855.  Her guardians got a position on one of the eastern stations.  Later they came to Burra where her uncle, Mr Francis Cross, was for some time caretaker and librarian at the Institute.  She remembered well the arrival in Burra of the survivors from the Bourke and Wills expedition with the relief party.  She first married Mr John Boundy in 1865 and one son John, and one daughter Mrs M. Johnson of Broken Hill, survive.  She later married Mr Richard Penrose at Moonta in 1882 and one son Mr L.S. Penrose, survives.  Mr Penrose died some years ago.
