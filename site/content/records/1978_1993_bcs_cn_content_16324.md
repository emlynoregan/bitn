BCS.  Staff Profile: Sally Adcock

I am teaching Year 7 at BCS.  For the past ten years I have lived at Hahndorf.  I received most of my primary education in the Adelaide suburbs and began secondary education in a country area school with Years 11 & 12 at a private school in Adelaide.  I then completed a Diploma in Teaching at Magill CAE with major studies in Expressive Arts – Dance & Music.  For fifteen years I have participated in Dance through Dalcrose Eurhythmics with wide experience also in tap, social, creative, ballroom, aerobic dance, dance drama and religious dance.  I play many instruments, namely piano, flute, guitar and recorder.  I perform contemporary Christian music in the Balhannah Uniting Church Musical Group ‘Access’.  I also enjoy cooking and sewing.  I have been actively involved in netball and tennis clubs as a player, senior and junior coach and qualified Association umpire.
