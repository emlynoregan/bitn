Notice.  SA Mining Association calls tenders for 2,000 bushels of oats, 500 bushels of crushed maize and 2,000 bushels of bran.  Henry Ayers, Secretary.

Notice.  SA Mining Association.  Notice is given that on the 1 May next the price of cartage of ore from the Burra Burra Mines to Port Adelaide will be increased to Â£3 per 21 cwt and will continue during the winter months.

Carters should note that in addition to the rules at present existing respecting the carting of ore, from 1 May next no person will be permitted to load ore unless provided with tarpaulins sufficiently large to prevent the ore from the wet.  Carters will be held responsible for any damage the bags or ore may sustain on the way from Mine to Port.

Persons desirous of entering into the ore carting business or of increasing their present means are informed that as a consequence of the amount of ore now at the Mine, which cannot possibly be carted this season, and the large expected raisings during the winter months, employment will be found in the 1848-49 summer for a considerable number of drays in excess of those engaged this season.

Henry Ayers, Secretary.
