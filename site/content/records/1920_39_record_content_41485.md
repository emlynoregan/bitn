Frank Treloar: Looking Back

Recollections of Past Depressions.

His parents went north in 1852 and lived on what is now Spring Vale Vineyard at Watervale where Frank grew up.

Burra Mine gave employment not only in the mine, but in carting on the Gulf Road.  Returning diggers [from Victoria] brought money.  At the time it was believed that wheat wouldn’t grow north of Clare nor east or west of the hills running south from it.  Beyond Clare was said to be fit only for squatters.  Beyond Mt Remarkable lay the ‘Far North’.

Ploughs were then heavy wooded ploughs (swing) drawn by bullocks and harrows were made from a piece of a tree.  Harvest was by sickle and the grain was tied into sheaves and threshed with a flail before being wind sieved and carted to Gawler for sale or grist.  Reaping cost 15/- to 20/- an acres.  This situation did not last long.  Soon two blacksmiths, Billy Rowse of Mintaro and John Lines of Leasingham, made single and later double furrow iron ploughs and iron harrows.  Frank’s father introduced the first Ridley reaper and winnower to the district.

In 1860 Wallaroo Mines were discovered and developed quickly.  Farmers now had a ready sale for produce east and west.  More land was surveyed and sol for cash, favouring the agents and speculators, not the small men.  Pleuro[-pneumonia] then wiped out the bullocks in their thousands causing horses to replace them in farming and in carting.  In the 1870s Auburn was an important centre and had important horse and cattle sales.  Consignments of over 100 draught horses came from Tasmania by Mr Aliston.  Farm production became more satisfactory.  The Government made land available on conditional purchase to bona fide settlers and settlement spread north.  Farrell’s Flat became an important receiving station on the eastern side of the ranges and Hoyleton to the west.  Clare was a centre for produce from the new areas to the north.  Later still Pt Pirie became the shipping point and its railway cut off much of the wheat that previously came south.  Farmers did well, but some made no provision for bad seasons.  In the 1890s soil exhaustion made it seem that the land would never again produce good yields and 5-8 bushel per acre became the norm.  Farmers were barely existing.  Wages fell to 5 or 6/- a day and there were no jobs.  Land was practically unsaleable.  In good years around Farrell’s Flat it was sold on easy terms for £2-15-0 an acre.  Banks knew it was useless to foreclose and took what interest they could.  In the city unemployment was severe.  Mr Kither opened a soup kitchen and many were in rags and practically bootless.  The gold rush to Teetulpa in some ways saved the day – more for the hope it gave than for the quantity of gold it produced and as it declined Silverton and Broken Hill developed.  Late in the 1890s the use of phosphates saved the farmer, boosting yields and enabling him to pay off debts.  Phosphates and seed drills saved the day.

The drought of 1898 was a severe blow, but it broke in May 1899 and things then changed dramatically.  1900-1913 were good seasons and with the use of phosphates the farmers’ position improved wonderfully.  Farm incomes rose, debts were reduced and land values rose.  In 1914 came a very bad drought, in some ways the worst, but farmers were better prepared for it and could agist their horses.

War broke out in 1914.

Following the 1914 drought came 15 years with good crops and satisfactory prices.  Money was plentiful.  Spending rose, Governments borrowed money from overseas and when this dried up they floated Federal Loans which soaked up working capital and this was a prime cause of unemployment and depression.
