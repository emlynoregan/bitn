Local Board of Health

The Inspector of the Central Board is insisting that those with licenses to sell milk must have a properly paved shed and drainage.  There was debate on how this would affect some poor people making a pittance from one or two cows, but dependant upon that little and unable to afford a proper shed.

The Town Clerk thought these people would have to get out of the business.  He will write to the Central Board pointing out the problems and asking if any variation in regulation can be made.
