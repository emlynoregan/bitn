Jazz in the Monster Mine went off without a hitch on Saturday night, with a sell-out crowd of c. 500.  The award-winning Adelaide Band E Type Jazz and the entertaining Dixieland line-up, Adelaide City Jazzmen provided the entertainment.  The rain held off, but the wind got a little chilly.

Profits will aid local charities, the maintenance of heritage and Sir Hubert Wilkinsâ€™ Cottage.  The site this year was improved with necessary fencing and power infrastructure.  It was interesting to note that the water level had dropped about a metre from last year.
