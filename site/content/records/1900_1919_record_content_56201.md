Mrs Elizabeth Richards (Court House Hotel).  The Inspector found it well kept and comfortably furnished with no billiards or sample rooms.  There were pit toilets and it was lit by acetylene gas.  Police evidence supported the application.  Mrs Richards had held the licence for 12 years and had just renewed her lease for 5 years.
