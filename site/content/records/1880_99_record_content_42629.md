Burra Town Council, 5 October.

£10-15-3 of the cost of the brewery connection to the water supply will be charged to the capital account.

SAMA has granted a strip of land 100’ x 40’ as an addition to the cemetery.

Cr Rabbich proposed the Council apply to SAMA to buy a further 100’ strip as it cost £91-10-0 to extend the wall 100 ‘, but would cost only another £33 for the extra 100’.

Cr Watt amended the motion by calling for tenders for removing the old wall and erecting the new.  Cr O’Leary 2nd because he thought the 100’ would do for 10-15 years and it would be time enough then to enlarge it.

Cr Watt proposed the pump at the cemetery be repaired and the weeding attended to.
