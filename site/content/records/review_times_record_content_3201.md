Mr Hawker said that in the end heritage would have to pay its way.  ‘But if the heritage character was destroyed by unwise activity the town would just become a handful of historical sites which was the case with Hahndorf, he said.’

Burra Traders Association would invite an expert from Adelaide to discuss the idea.  Cr Barton said the response of traders would most likely depend on what funding arrangements could be developed.

The Council has written to the Association expressing concern about the poor condition of some of the businesses and commercial premises in Burra.
