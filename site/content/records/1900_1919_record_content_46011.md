Cr Killicoat asked if there was ever a motion passed to fence Best Place, as some ratepayers were anxious a portion be fenced.

Cr Lane said there was a motion that it not be fenced.  It was thought that if it were fenced off level there would not be a chain road.  The Government had taken away the water troughs when they took over the water supply, but it was not with the idea of fencing.
