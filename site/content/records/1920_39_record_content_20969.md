District Council of Hanson Ratepayers’ Meeting 23 October at Council Chamber, Hanson.

About 70 attended and the meeting had to be held in the open.  It had been called on account of the recent dismissal of the District Clerk Mr Treloar and the overseer Mr Williams and the combination of the two roles into one.

Mr Hawkes moved that the meeting deplored the action of the Council.

The report runs for 2½ columns and the argument for the move was grounded on financial savings which were challenged, but the debate here requires further knowledge for it to be evaluated.

The chairman (Cr Scholz) said ‘he had on occasion been treated with contempt by Mr Treloar’ and he gave instances.  The weight this had in the decision was left to those present to decide.

Eventually the motion was lost 36 to 16 with 20 abstaining.  Other matters were then raised.
