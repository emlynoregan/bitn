Burra Hospital.  The Chief Secretary is to be advised they were not seeking to nominate members, merely that they might be consulted.

It has not at present proved possible to have a meeting with the Chief Secretary concerning the Doctors.

The meeting was adjourned for a week to devise a way of reducing staff as a consequence of the low usage of the hospital.

At least two probationer nurses desired to leave, as they could not receive their ATNA Certificate under present circumstances.
