Burra Burra DC.  There is an article on the use of incinerators in Burra, explaining which type is approved for use during the fire ban season of 30 November to 28 February.  (From 1 November in the Eastern Hundreds.)

Downdraft only type permitted and none at all are permitted on total fire ban days.

Any sort is permitted March and April, but an area of 4 metres radius must be cleared of flammable material and a person capable of controlling the fire must be present.
