Ray Jennison & Ron Wuttke were fishing off Wallaroo on Sunday and tried to catch a 10-12 ft shark they had spotted.  It took the bait, but in doing so revealed itself as about 20 ft in length and of immense girth.  They were relieved when it spat the hook out and they lost no time in hauling in the line and heading for shore in their 17 ft boat.
