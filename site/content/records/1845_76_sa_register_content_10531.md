The Smelting of Iron (Editorial)

SA possesses rich deposits of iron, but hitherto the cost of labour has made its exploitation uneconomic.  Now the newly invented process of Mr Bessemer seems likely to so reduce costs as to make iron production here feasible.  Indeed it is somewhat surprising that no steps have so far been taken to ascertain whether this is the case.

Mr M. MacDermott has written to the Chief Secretary, suggesting a Commission be set up to investigate the possibility and desirability of establishing an iron smelting facility in SA.  [The text of the letter is printed.   It outlines the case at some length.]

The Under-Secretary has replied that, while the establishment of such a Commission is an interesting idea and will meet with due consideration, it is something that requires parliamentary approval and the voting of funds.

[The editor said he believes that it will doubtless be one item to engage the early attention of the new Parliament.]
