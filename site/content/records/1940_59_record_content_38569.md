Burra Bowling Club held its AGM in Pearce’s Buildings on Monday 30 August.  Membership has remained almost static, with 10 losses and 12 new members.  In the past season the club joined the Mid North Bowling Association and this move has proved really worthwhile.  Several improvements to plant and equipment were mooted for the year, but these changes have not been completed, although most are expected to be carried out before the start of the 1948-49 season.  During the year the club lost a staunch supporter following the death of Mr Ernest Marston.  He was a keen officer and player and the club has benefitted by a bequest from him of £500.  Messrs F.H. Reed, W. Chambers and L.W. Gebhardt have also helped the club by relinquishing all their interest in their Syndicate shares and transferred them to the club.  The Treasurer’s report showed the club to have a deficit of £63-8-2.  Elected: Patron, Mr H.J.B. Jennison; President, Mr E.E. Finch; Vice-Presidents, Messrs M.T. Fuller and J.T. Pascoe; Secretary & Treasurer, Mr H.M. Scott.
