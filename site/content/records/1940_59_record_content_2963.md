Burra Town Council.

Council’s legal advice: they could take no action against certain itinerant hawkers under present by-laws.

The Municipal Assoc. legal advice was that the Council could not be forced to contribute £11-15-0 towards expenses in the AWU Award Case.  Council’s own solicitor had given similar advice.

The AWU award gives 14/6 a day to the lowest paid and 15/- to the overseer.

Finance Committee to deal with the matter.

Civil Defence Committee forwarded a bill for the use of the hall and Council Chamber, saying it had no funds except what the Council subscribed and as it was formed by the Government it considered it should have the use of the Council Chamber free of charge, also the meeting in the hall on 29 May was organised by the Council.

Council agreed to pay, but to take no responsibility for further accounts.

The Progress Assoc. asked the Council to compile a list of all persons in the Fighting Forces for an Honour Roll after the War.

The Mayor said it was in the hands of the Soldiers’ Welfare Committee.
