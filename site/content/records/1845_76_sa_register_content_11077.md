Opening of the Gawler Town Railway [From a reporter.]

The Commissioners decoded to accommodate as many as possible on the opening train to Gawler by providing a return ticket for 5/-.  It was also arranged that the excursion train would leave after the arrival of the first train from Port Adelaide to accommodate passengers from there.  Its return was arranged to meet the last train to Port Adelaide.  The morning was cold and gloomy, but the rain held off except for one or two very light showers.  The platform was thronged with people long before the scheduled departure time of 9 a.m. and hundreds more lined North Terrace to see the departure.  There were 13 first and second class carriages and three or four open cars behind the engine and tender.  The carriages were decorated with bunting and Union Jacks.  The total numbers were between 800 & 900.  505 tickets were sold , but in addition 43 passengers joined from Port Adelaide, mechanics and workmen employed on the line were allowed to go with their wives free of charge, a few joined at Salisbury and infants in arms went free and of course the official party and the band must be added.

Departure was delayed till 9.15 due to the late arrival of the Port Adelaide train.  Salisbury was reached at 10 a.m. and there was then a delay of ten minutes.  The train arrived at Gawler at 10.50 a.m.

Omnibuses took the crowd the mile into the town; their licensed number of passengers being greatly exceeded on this festive occasion, with many clinging to the roofs.  The return journey began at 3.32 p.m. and Salisbury was reached at 4.11 p.m.  Here the afternoon down train was late, which delayed the excursion train by 25 minutes.  Adelaide was reached at 5.15 p.m. and again there were many spectators to see the event.  The maximum speed attained was 33 m.p.h. on the return trip between Smithfield and Salisbury.  The whole event was very well managed and the only accident occurred when a Union Jack on one of the carriages was ignited by a spark on the return journey.
