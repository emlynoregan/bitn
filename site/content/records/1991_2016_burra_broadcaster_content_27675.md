Burra National Trust has accepted the six months extension of the lease on the Visitor Centre, in order to negotiate the terms of a longer lease.

Rob Humphris won the recent ‘Sam the Ram’ competition at the Filed Days in Burra and so has $1,000 to spend on a ram or rams.  He has elected to take his prize from Old Ashrose stud at Hallett – probably at their on-property auction in October.  [Photo.]
