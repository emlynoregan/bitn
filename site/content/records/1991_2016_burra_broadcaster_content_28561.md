Helen Jensen was recently commissioned to do a painting on the history of mining at Coober Pedy from 1915 to the present.  Her work was in two panels, each 2.5 metres wide and it has been shipped to Germany, where it will be used as a backdrop for a display of opal jewellery and a computer copy will be made to serve as a backdrop in different cities at various gem fairs.  She has also had a commission for a 5 by 3 feet painting of ‘The Breakaways’ – also bound for Germany.
