Cr Linkson then tried to speak, but was halted by the Mayor, even after pointing out that others had been allowed to speak two or three times without there being a motion before the chair.

Cr Hardy then said the engineer got an extra amount of pay last year to attend to pumping and meter reading.  He did not believe the breakage was an unavoidable case and did not believe the engineer would grumble to pay the extra amount.  In winter he had scarcely anything to do.

Cr Linkson complained that when he tried to speak he was stopped.  He tried to ask Cr Parks if his report was official, but was ruled out of order.

Cr Hardy then moved that the engineer pay for the extra labour hired to read the meters.

Cr Kitchen 2nd and spoke in support of Cr Hardy’s motion.

Cr Linkson left the room.

The motion was put and lost.

Cr Linkson returned and explained that he repeated what he had said above and denounced the action of the Mayor in strong terms and said the breakage at the Waterworks was one that should have received immediate attention.

The Mayor ruled him out of order and refused to allow a discussion.

Cr Linkson moved that the Council be censured for their conduct concerning the breakage on Saturday night.  He held the Council should have been called together and repairs effected as soon as possible.  The Council did not do its duty to ratepayers.

Cr Parks thought any censure should be on the shoulders of the late Waterworks Committee.

The motion was not 2nd.

The engineer asked to say a few words.

The mayor: ‘I think not.’

He nevertheless said he could be relied upon not to employ any man while he was able to stand, but if he were compelled to read meters just now and attend to the water supply he would have to travel all night with a lantern.

The matter dropped.

Cr Linkson moved that six or seven men remove the railway obstruction in the creek and the cost be charged to the Government.

The Mayor called for deferral of action, but the motion, 2nd by Cr Hardy, passed.
