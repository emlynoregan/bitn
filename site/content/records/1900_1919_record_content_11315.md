Alf Bevan employed by W. Truscott at the slaughterhouse two miles east of Burra narrowly escaped losing an eye on Sunday.  While dressing a sheep the knife flew up and lodged within a half-an-inch of his left eye, penetrating to the bone.  The bleeding was stopped with difficulty and the sight of the eye was hazy on Monday, but no serious trouble is anticipated.
