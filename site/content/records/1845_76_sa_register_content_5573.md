Cornwall & Devon Society (Editorial)

[The editor says he disagrees with Mr Neales comments that prisoners at Dartmoor (in England) will be employed in mining, before going on to other matters.  The editor gives a generally favourable view of the aims of the society and does not join with those who might fear its aims included the reduction in wages.  He puts any illiberal aspects of the administration of mining in SA down to inexperience with mining affairs, rather ‘than from any innate churlishness or acquired habits of parsimony.  The editor does not, however, go along with any suggestion that the state should be giving any aid to mining interests in the form of ‘bounty or adventitious support’.]
