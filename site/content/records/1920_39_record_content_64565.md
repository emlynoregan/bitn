The great stack still standing near the ruins of the smelting works and known to Burra residents as the old Smelts Chimney, was climbed by Arthur Jordan, a schoolboy of 12 years of age, son of the late J.D. Jordan, watchmaker, of Kooringa.

It is 85 feet in height and measures 56 feet in circumference at the base.  Two bands of iron at each corner run from top to bottom.  These are two inches wide and are fastened by joints and staples at intervals of two feet apart.  This was all the hand and foot hold the boy had.  It was a perilous climb for one unaided and above an attack of giddiness, one slip, one false step and a fall would have been fatal, but he seems to have not felt fear.  It was a marvellous feat for so young a lad and for daring and courage and endurance has seldom been equalled.
