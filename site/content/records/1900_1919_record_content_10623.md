The Muff Football Match.  The whole affair is covered in some detail in an article of 1⅔ columns.  The procession and its participants are described.  Of note was a dilapidated Aborigines’ cart that is described in some detail.  It had written on the side Yendinna Jack, Hergott 15 tons.  There was a back-bush missionary’s vehicle that also rather libelled the missionary effort.  Other participants and their disguises are listed.  As well as the football game there were apparently some novel races with a host of very small prizes.  The game was ‘devoid of scientific play, the contestants being satisfied to make themselves as funny as possible’.  The social receives about ¾ column report on speeches and toasts.

[Personal interest.  C. Fuss went as a coachman.  C. Fuss also won a comb in the ¼ mile walk and in the ¼ mile race C. Fuss won a rattle and R. Fuss some buttons.]
