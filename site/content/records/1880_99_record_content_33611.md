Local Board of Health.  The town was inspected last Wednesday following complaints about unsatisfactory work by the scavenger.  Aberdeen, Redruth, Hampton and Kooringa were visited.  The town was found to be in good order generally.  One house in Hampton was found to be substandard despite repeated notices and the occupant was warned that unless ordinary cleanliness was enforced legal remedy would follow.  In Kooringa a man and woman named Reed were found living in sheer corruption and filth.  [The matter already noted above.]  The Board found the work of the scavenger to be quite satisfactory.
