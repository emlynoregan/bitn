Weather.  It has been very hot with temperatures over 100°F for days.  A thunderstorm dropped 20 points in Aberdeen and 12 in Kooringa on Monday and there are scattered reports of falls in the east as well.  To the north there have been heavy falls.  The Flinders Ranges report falls from one to two inches and above, while Yunta got 2.05”.  Heavy falls at Riverton and Saddleworth were especially welcome at the former where seven large haystacks in the heart of town had been burning for some days.
