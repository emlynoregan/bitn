Football.  Monday at Riverton: Burra Ramblers 2.4 tied with Riverton 2.4.

Wednesday: half-time Ramblers 3.7 led Aberdeen 2.0 and at full-time Ramblers 7.19 defeated Aberdeen 3.0

Monday at Victoria Park: Burra 5.6 defeated Clare 2.7

After the game the Clare team started for home in foul weather, but the night was so dark and the lamps so poor that they had trouble keeping to the road and eventually returned to Vivian’s Hotel for the night – reaching it only after midnight.  Tuesday morning was sunny and a more congenial return trip was then completed.
