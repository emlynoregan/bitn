Burra Show 1948

The annual show was held on Saturday 9 October in perfect weather and with a large crowd.

This year’s show was an improvement on 1947 and Horses in Action attracted 167 entries.  The Art section had 44 adult entries and 29 from children, which is an increase from the previous year.  The entries in fowls were dominated by outside exhibitors, with locals filling in.  The local homing club ensured many entries in pigeons.  There were 217 fowls and 175 pigeons entered, but only 4 canaries.  Cattle saw 45 entries of good quality.  Dog entries totalled 25.  Flowers were outstanding and beautiful, with 381 entries.  Fruit and vegetables are not usually numerous in Burra and this year there were 8 for fruit and 34 for vegetables.  Grain and Fodder attracted 34 good quality entries.  Cookery had a fine array of entries from the more than 130 on the day.  Needlework, with 112 entries was also well represented.

Despite Burra’s reputation as a major sheep producing district, there were only 94 sheep entries and the Wool section only attracted 30 fleeces.

A sheep shearing demonstration was arranged by Mr C. Lott.  Two outstanding displays were N.J. Baynes’ dining room suite of dolls’ furniture and Mr H.J.B. Jennison’s display of his local tyre re-treading industry.  The annual display of schoolwork was a pleasing addition to the main pavilion.  Much of the credit for the show’s success must go to the hard work of the Secretary, Mr R.E. Angel and to other committee members and conveners.

The show was officially opened by Mr P.A. McBride MHR, who was then entertained at the official luncheon.

Side Show Babies.  For the third year in succession a wife of a sideshow operator has given birth while in Burra for the show.

Bicycles.  There have been complaints about children and even some adults riding bicycles on footpaths.  The police will be asked to take action in this matter.

The Annual Hallett Red Cross Flower Show was held on 2 October.  Entries were somewhat down, but the quality was maintained.  Cooking entries were disappointing.  The event was officially opened by Mrs L. Thomas from Burra.  [Results are printed.]
