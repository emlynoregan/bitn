 17251→Once upon a time the hills were lightly timbered with gum and sheoaks.  Kooringa means Sheoak Creek.  There were acres of scrub and valleys were prolific in vegetation and the hills and dales were clothed in wild flowers.  The timber all went within 12 years and vast herds of goats used for milk stripped herbage clean to the roots.  Since then the municipal authorities have done much to plant trees and an avenue was planted from Kooringa to Aberdeen as a memorial of Queen Victoria’s Jubilee, when Sir Frederick Holder was Mayor.  (Later a Premier of SA and first Speaker of the Commonwealth House of Representatives.)  There are remains of primitive dugouts in the clay banks of the Burra Creek – masons being scarce and the cartage of building materials by bullock dray not feasible, so the miners ‘dug in’.  These rude houses were unhealthy, unsafe, unsanitary and badly ventilated.
 17252→
 17253→Later scores of cottages were erected by the company.  The directors put up a school, church and hospital and provided a fine recreation ground.*
 17254→
 17255→There was once a gaol in Burra and in later years it was used as a girls’ reformatory.  Mrs Holden (mother of the chairman of Holden’s Motor Bodies Ltd) was matron there for some years.  The municipality was proclaimed in July 1876 and Philip Lane was the first Mayor.
 17256→
 17257→Many old hotels have gone: the Pig & Whistle, Miners’ Arms, Bushman’s Home, Smelter’s Home & the White Hart.  Alfred Barker, father of the late John Barker, kept one of them.

 17259→Why is it named Burra?
 17260→
 17261→The minute book of SAMA says:
 17262→
 17263→‘The mines are Named the Burra Burra mines from their being situated near the creek of that name, and the word Burra meaning in the native language “great”’.  Signed by Samuel Stocks Jun.  First Chairman of Directors, but the secretary (Sir Henry Ayers) pencilled in:
 17264→
 17265→‘Not native, but Hindoostanee.’
 17266→
 17267→Before 1845 coolie shepherds had been employed in the area by the pioneer pastoralist James Stein.  The name sounds Aboriginal and appears widely throughout the Commonwealth with a wide variety of meanings in different languages.  Stein, who had the country before the copper discovery, was a brother of Anne, Countess of Fife, and his father sat in the House of Commons for Bletchingley.  He died in poverty at Mt Gambier in 1877.
 17268→
 17269→[* The directors gave the land for the school and church and provided a hospital for mine employees.  The town hospital came later when the original Burra Hotel was purchased for the purpose.  The land for the recreation ground was provided, but not the cost of fencing or development of the site.]
