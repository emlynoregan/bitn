The Kerin Relief Fund raised £227-18-3 and it has been decided to pay this out in weekly sums over a period of nearly five years.  [This, excluding any interest accruing, would seem to give Mrs Kerin about 17/6 a week income.  Ellen Gertrude Kerin nee Hobby married Edgar Thomas Kemble 11 May 1925.]
