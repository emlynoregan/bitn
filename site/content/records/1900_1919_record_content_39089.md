Burra Town Council

The Railway Department refuses to move the fencing at the goods yard.  It has been there 40 years and they see no reason to remove it now.  If the Council wishes to go to the expense themselves there will be no objection.

Patriotic Note: Crs Lane and Harris send a telegram from Adelaide re the parade of SA volunteers ‘Burra Boys Lead Procession, Lieut. Lewis, Lord, Sandland, Cock, Dow: Hurrah!’

The Citizen’s Militia Force is still awaiting authorities’ clarification.

The 23rd Light Horse is to be recruited up to full strength immediately.  Send applications to Lieut. Copley, Kooringa.  Men are also needed to fill the ranks of the Citizens’ Forces.

SM Kenyon has been presented with a case of pipes by the Masonic Lodge.
