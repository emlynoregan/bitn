52, 33, 19 Aug. 1931, page 3: Shell Co. Dance.  The Shell Co. is to hold a dance in every town in Australia on 29 August and Mr T.H. Woollacott has been tireless in making arrangements.  The Institute Hall is engaged and so the SAFU store, now vacant, (but late [Bence’s] Cash & Carry Store) will be used.]
