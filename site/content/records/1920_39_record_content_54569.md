Notice.  From 6 February 1935 L.T. Paroissien has purchased the business of Mrs T.M. Godlee at Booborowie and is conducting it as a General Store.

Mr R.C. Sexton of the Savings Bank in Burra who has had six months sick leave is expected to resume duties in the next fortnight.

Burra High School will open today after the holidays and the enrolment is a pleasing 51.  The return of 31 of last yearâ€™s 44 students is pleasing, but 18 new enrolments are not as pleasing a figure.
