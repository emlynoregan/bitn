Obituary/Inquest, on 16 June, before J.D. Cave JP into the death of Annie Statton.

Edward Statton, husband: - Was married 5 June and went to Adelaide, returning on 9 June and after a cup of tea with his mother they went to visit hers. Went to bed between 10.30 and 11.00 and after about 15 minutes a sound like 40-50 stones landing on the roof cause my wife to leap right off the bed. I tried to laugh it off, but she was trembling till morning. In the morning she took a little brandy and hot water and her mother came to stay while I went to work. She stayed at her mother's on Tuesday night, but couldn't sleep. On Wednesday sent for Dr Sangster, but there was little change till Friday. On Sunday I left home at 9.00 a.m. and returned about 12.00, when my mother-in-law said Annie was dying. Both Dr Sangster and Dr Nesbitt came in the afternoon and Annie died between 12.00 and 1.00 a.m. that night.

Dr Sangster: - On my first visit I found the deceased suffering from a nervous headache, but did not think the case serious. When I visited with Dr Nesbitt we did not see anything to indicate danger. The post mortem disclosed a large clot in the brain. Dr Nesbitt: - Could not attribute the clot to anything but violent emotion. Verdict was death by apoplexy caused by a sudden shock received on the night of 9 June from stones thrown on the roof by a person or persons unknown. A verdict of manslaughter is recorded against such unknown person or persons.  [Born Ann Ellery 25 July 1857 District of Burra: died 16 June 1879 Kooringa.]
