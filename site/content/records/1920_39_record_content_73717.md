East and West Wards are to share the cost of bituminising ‘the road from Chapel St to the Methodist Church Bridge’.  [This doesn’t make much sense.  It could mean Chapel St from Commercial St to the bridge near the Methodist Church, but the report in 60, 7, 14 Feb. 1939, page 1 reveals there was a word misplaced in the above, which should have read ‘the road from Chapel St Bridge to the Methodist Church’.]
