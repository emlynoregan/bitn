Burra Racing Club conducted an excellent meeting on Wednesday.  Weather was good if a little windy.  There was some difficulty in getting horses into the mobile starting stalls, used for the first time at Burra and the Maiden Handicap was delayed for 26 minutes.  The delay was entirely due to the lack of experience of the horses.  The track and surrounds were in excellent condition.  Gate takings were £209.  (£30 down on the previous March meeting and c. £100 down on September.)  [A photo of the Club President Mr G. Gask is printed and so are the results.]
