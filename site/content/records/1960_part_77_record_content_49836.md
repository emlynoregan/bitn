Redruth Methodist Church

About 150 people crowded into the church on Sunday morning for the service which marked the discontinuance of weekly worship there.  State Secretary of the SA Methodist Conference Rev. A.R. Medson preached the sermon.  Brian Thamm, who is Circuit Steward and Secretary to the Redruth Trust, read a statement outlining the reasons for the ending of services at Redruth and outlining the history of the church.  The decision ‘was made in the good faith that a unified congregation and a centralised witness of Methodism to the town and district, was the only attitude which could be rightly adopted by an authentic twentieth century church.’
