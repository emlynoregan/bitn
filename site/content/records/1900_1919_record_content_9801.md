Fred Camp, who lost his wife some four months ago, has recently been an inmate of Burra Hospital.  While there he made the acquaintance of a young girl from the Reformatory who was also a patient.  Last week they arranged to meet at the courthouse to be married.  The clerk Mr Giles obliged with Mrs Casey of Hampton and Mr Nichol Gordon as witnesses.  M-C Phelan later went to Fred’s House and said that Mrs Holden of the Reformatory would like to congratulate the new Mrs Camp and he took her to the Reformatory in his carriage.  Once there the bride was immediately charged with deserting the institution and was detained.  Mrs Camp, nee Francis Carbis said she was 22, while Fred is 70.  Authorities say she is only 20 and another version says she is 19.  Under the Act she can be detained till she is 21 for breeches of discipline while at the Reformatory.  [There do not appear to be any records of her birth in SA but the marriage registration says she was Frances Carbis aged 22 daughter of Henry Carbis.  On the birth of a daughter Amy Gertrude on 10 September 1905 she is listed as Frances Louisa Carbis.]
