The Labor Party Social & Dance to aid Mrs Davies was held on the very cold and wet Thursday evening last week.  Attendance was thus not as great as hoped for, but a number of tickets had been pre-sold, so financially it went better than it appeared.  The organisers arranged for political speakers [who are reported in c. â…” column] and after that a dance was held.
