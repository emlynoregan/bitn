Salvation Army.  The promised visit of Brigadier Birkenshaw and Mrs Birkenshaw to Burra took place on Saturday last.  The night was cold for an open-air meeting yet a happy hour was spent in the main street.  On Sunday there were excellent attendances and the Brigadier gave a powerful address.  Monday saw a social meeting at which the Mayor presided and the Brigadier gave an address on the Salvation Armyâ€™s social work.
