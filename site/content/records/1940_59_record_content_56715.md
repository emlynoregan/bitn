Railway Accident.  A train that was being shunted at Mt Bryan emerged from behind a brake van and hit a utility that was crossing the line at about 8.15 p.m.  The utility rolled over and was dragged under the truck until it cut the air line and stopped the train.  When the train moved forward the utility was pulled back onto its wheels.  One boy in the back was thrown onto the permanent way and got a few scratches and bruises.  The three in the cabin were unhurt except for bruises.  The four involved were: Robert John Foote, Douglas Burton, Murray Burton and L. Hughes.
