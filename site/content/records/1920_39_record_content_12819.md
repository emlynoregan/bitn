Seaside Trip.  The Semaphore outing day was cool with some showers amid sunny periods.  Fully half the people made for Adelaide after arriving at Semaphore.  Many men went to the Adelaide Oval for the interstate cricket match.  Not many went bathing at Semaphore on account of the very choppy sea, but the weather was warm enough for the jetty and many went fishing, while the sideshows did good business.  There was a heavy shower about teatime and parents welcomed the departure for home which was reached at midnight, with the second train not long after.
