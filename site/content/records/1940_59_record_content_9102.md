Obituaries.  Mr Phil Builder died at the Orroroo Hospital after a very severe illness.  He was only 37.  He was manager at Orroroo for Elder, Smith & Co. Ltd and had previously been at one time on that firm’s staff at Burra.  He was a son of the late Tom Builder, also of Elder, Smith & Co. Ltd and had a close connection with Burra.  His father and mother were born and raised here.  Mrs Builder is a daughter, Jessie, of the late Mr & Mrs P.L. Killicoat of Abberton Park – now owned by Mr Murray Tiver.

A sad aspect of his death is that his young wife, only a few weeks ago also succumbed to pneumonia.  Their death leaves four young sons, of whom the two eldest are twins.

Cpl Gilbert Builder, who was reported last week as seriously ill overseas is a brother.

[Philip William Builder born 8 April 1904, Gladstone: died 13 February 1942 Orroroo and his wife born Elliot Robe Hamilton 2 February 1907, North Adelaide: died 23 January 1942, Orroroo.]
