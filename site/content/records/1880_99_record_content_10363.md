Burra Town Council, 6 August.

Arthur Lungley, the Acting Hydraulic Engineer, wrote re the request to extend the water main to the eastern boundary of Redruth and to the Hospital.  The Commissioner of Public Works has ordered the arrangement of a water supply under the guarantee system.  The proposed extension will see a 30,000 gallon reservoir on the hill to the west of Roach’s Mill, about 120 chains of 4” main and 52 chains of 3” main to supply the eastern end of Ludgvan St and southwards to Kooringa along Commercial St to Ware St, but not to the hospital.  The reservoir is high enough to supply the hospital and Mr C. Drew’s house south of Commercial St.  The SAR offer to buy water at 1/- per 1,000 gallons and require 10,000 to 12,000 gallons per day in summer, but very little in winter.  The estimated cost of the extension is £2,488.  The amount spent to date is £912, making £3,400 in total.

The estimated yearly expenditure:

5% on £3,000	170

Rent of the shaft	100

Labour working expenses	150

Fuel costs	150

Total	£570

If the Bon Accord Mine shaft cannot be leased on favourable terms it would be advisable to deepen and timber the shaft on an adjoining allotment owned by the Corporation.  This would incur an increase in costs to £3,800 and the yearly expenses would then be: -

5% on £3,800	190

Working expenses	300

Total	£490	say £500

This would be for 30,000 gallons a day, but without railway water perhaps 10,000 gallons per day would reduce expenses to about £400 p.a.  (Expenses for the first two years would be less as the first year’s interest is at 3% and the 2nd year’s at 4%.)

Council is to try to ascertain likely water usage.

SAMA has promised to convey freehold of the Recreation Ground if it is enclosed and planted.
