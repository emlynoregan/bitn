Women’s Christian Temperance Union Central District Convention at Redruth 16 March in the Memorial Hall was addressed by the President Mrs Haldane of Saddleworth.  A paper was read by Mrs Bowman and one by Mrs McLeod.  Lady Holder spoke.  She blamed parents for not exerting control over their children.  ‘If the last Methodist Conference had taken the restrictions off dancing in respect to membership classes as some adherents had tried to do so, she would have left the Methodist connection.’

Rev. Alvey spoke against Institutes and their committees who permitted alcohol on the premises.

Lady Holder then spoke of the need to close bars.  6 o’clock closing was a start, but now drinking at dances was a serious problem and menace.  She urged organisation and prayer.
