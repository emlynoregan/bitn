The Uniting Church of Australia will celebrate its Silver Jubilee this weekend all around Australia.  The UCA was inaugurated on 22 June 1977 and saw the union of the Methodist, Congregational and Presbyterian Churches.  The UCA has the largest non-government welfare network in Australia.  The Burra District Uniting Church Congregation (formerly ‘Parish’) will celebrate with a service of worship at Farrell Flat Uniting Church on Sunday 23 June at 10 a.m.
