J.F. Hogan writes saying the Kooringa Football Association is out of order in re-naming itself the Burra Football Association.  The latter organisation comprising Kooringa, Aberdeen, North Booborowie & South Booborowie Clubs is simply in abeyance according to a minute moved and carried and the Kooringa Football Association is thus, to say the least, premature with tis name change.
