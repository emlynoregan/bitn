Burra School Board of Advice

The Board comprises:

W. West (Chairman)

A. Bartholomæus

W.H. Hardy

W.T. Rabbich

R.J. Daddow

It controls nine schools: Burra, Copperhouse, Hanson, Leighton, Booborowie, Baldina, Baldina Plains, Thistlebeds & World’s End Creek.

In August an inspection showed:

Copperhouse teacher was Thomas Nevin.  There were 57 on the roll and 51 present.

Hanson teacher was Louisa Snell.  There were 22 on the roll and 13 present.

Leighton teacher was O.C.E. Junge.  There were 34 on the roll and 24 present.

At the end of 1892 Mr Wittber, head teacher at Burra, was transferred to Rose Park after seven years there.  He was succeeded by Mr J.A. Kennedy.

The teacher’s accommodation at Leighton is very unsatisfactory.

(For 1892 the lack of a quorum prevented the Board from meeting till July, after which 8 meetings were held.)
