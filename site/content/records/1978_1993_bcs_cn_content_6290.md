Burra National Trust has made a submission for funds under the National Estate Grants Program to restore the Bon Accord Mine Buildings.

These comprise the Engineer’s Workshop and Mine Manager’s Residence and were built in 1846.  They are on the Register of the National Estate, listed on the Register of State heritage Items and classified by the National Trust of SA.  The local branch of the National Trust has started to set the site up as a Copper Mining Museum.  The local branch will match any funds granted on a dollar for dollar basis.

The restoration costs are estimated at $17,000, so the local branch will need to raise over $8,500.  They intend to do so by hiring keys to visitors of other National Trust sites in Burra, conducting bus tours of Burra, charging an entrance fee to the Bon Accord Mine Museum on long weekends and school holidays and bus tours to sites outside Burra in the district.  The aim is to have the Bon Accord Mine Museum open every day with a caretaker living in the Mine Manager’s house.  It is hoped to have the project finished for the Burra Copper festival over the October long weekend in 1983.
