Burra Pony Club is 35 years old next Saturday, when past and present members will gather to celebrate.  Among those present will be the first President, Mr Ray Wardle.  At that time Bill Keane was Vice-President and John Newton was Secretary-Treasurer.  The club has been represented in the Northern Zones each year and been successful in many State, National and International competitions.  Many small sporting clubs struggle to survive and the Burra Pony Club has succeeded due to its hard working and dedicated voluntary workers.  On Sunday the celebrations will be rounded off with a Fun Open Dressage Day.
