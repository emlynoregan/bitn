Kooringa News, 18 July

Accident/Obituary.  On Tuesday 17 July an old and respected miner Tobias Hampton was working with William Toy in the six fathom level, retimbering old ground.  They had got a set of timber partially fixed and in doing so exposed about four feet of ground without support.  Just as Hampton was making all secure the ground gave way and he was buried in tons of earth from an old drive.  It took three hours to recover the body.

[Tobias Hampton, Baptised 9 February 1811 Gwinnear, Cornwall: died 17 July 1866 Burra Mine, residence Kooringa. Information from BISA.]

At Redruth Court today a man named Hockey was fined for assaulting Mrs Veal.  He impudently said he would not pay and when told he must, he behaved in a most unbecoming manner and was removed by Corporal Shaw and two assistants.  His wife then assaulted the complainantâ€™s husband in open court and tried to rescue her husband from custody.  Hockey was then imprisoned for seven days and his wife reprimanded.

Dogs are still worrying sheep.  Mr Broad caught two in the act of killing a ram and tied them up pending identification.  In the night some persons cut the collars and the dogs have disappeared.

A movement has been made towards getting a piano for the Institute.
