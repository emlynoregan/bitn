British and Foreign Bible Society. The annual meeting was last Sunday and the deputation was Rev. R. S. Casely who preached to a small congregation at the Primitive Methodist Chapel in Redruth in the morning, to c.500 children from the combined Methodist Sunday schools in the afternoon and at the Bible Christian Church in the evening. Collections on Sunday raised £5 and the Monday public meeting £1-16-6.

Market Square Well.  The donations to the well so far:

Dr Nesbitt	£30

SAMA	£25

Drew & Co.	£10

Liston, Shakes & Co.	£10

Messrs Batchelor, Richardson, McBride, Bruse & Catchlove & Co.	each £5

Messrs Wilkinson, Parks & Lasscock & Drs Brummitt & Stephens	each £1

C.C. Williams and Coles & Co.	each £1-1-0

And a few others yet to come in, but even with a£ for £ Govt. subsidy there is barely enough to cover the £262 contract for a well of 300' depth.
