The Adelaide-Burra Cycle Race for 1948 will finish at Burra on 11 September.  Previously the race had started at Burra and finished at Adelaide.  Last Year Mayor Jennison had suggested it would be a good idea if it were reversed to finish here and the suggestion has been taken up.  The date of 11 September is perhaps unfortunate, in that it is the day the North-Eastern Football Final will be played at Booborowie.  The Secretary, Mr H. Garth, of the SA League of Wheelmen will visit Burra next Friday to finalise arrangements.
