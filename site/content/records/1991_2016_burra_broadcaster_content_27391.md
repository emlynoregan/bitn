Paxton Cottages

Goyder Council has appointed interim managers for Paxton Square Cottages while it decides on a long term strategy for their management.  Maswood Australia Pty Ltd will take over from Bev Fleming and Howard Matson on 20 March for six months.  Council is considering management options for the cottages and have selected Colin Wood and Victor Pozatto for the next six months to enable continuation of the management.  They are owners of Burra View House.

[This is not very clear, but seems to imply that Maswood and Messrs Wood and Pozatto are the same entity.]
