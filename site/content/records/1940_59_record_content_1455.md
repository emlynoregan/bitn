Weather.  Patchy rain associated with thunderstorms has dropped falls of from 20 to 200 points. Many dams out east were filled and creeks ran.  Falls, though patchy, were generally heavier in the farming areas.  Falls were on 23 April and rain set in again last night and it is raining steadily as we go to press.
