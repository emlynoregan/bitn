The Seaside Trip has been set for 25 February.

After some debates on the attractions of Henley Beach, Semaphore was decided on as the destination.  The train will start at 5.30 a.m. from Hallett and from Semaphore at 5.30 p.m.  Trains will stop at Hanson, Farrell’s Flat, Mintaro & Manoora.  600 adult and 600 children’s tickets will be printed.  There was some discussion when it seemed that Drew & Crewes might not close for the day.  Eventually Mr Crewes said he would ‘do his best to try and close’.
