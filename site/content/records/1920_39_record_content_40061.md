Ratepayers’ Meeting at Burra Institute 26 November

About 70 people attended.  F.T. Sara took the chair.

The Mayor was questioned about the £15 given him since there was no Mayoral allowance.  He said it was given to help pay for the 1930 Children’s Christmas Tree and for entertaining the Premier and other visitors.  He said such entertainment had cost c. £25.

A question also arose over payment to J.A. Rosewall the late overseer and he read the Act relating to such dismissals.

Mr S. Kellaway wondered why £120 of spremax on hand last year and paid for did not appear on the balance sheet.  The Mayor said that would be explained later on.

Mr M.S. Edwards said it came under assets and liabilities and not receipts and expenditure.

Cr Pearce, who is retiring, said he was glad to have had a hand in improving the water supply to East Ward and getting the land in front of the school made town property.  He thought North Ward got more than its fair share of expenditure.  At least 30% of East Ward expenditure had been on bridge repairs.

Cr Allen intended to stand down, but as no one had come forward he nominated again and was thus surprised on Monday 23 November to learn that Mr Sampson had nominated.

The Mayor said that 1932 would be difficult due to unemployment, the depression and low primary production prices.

The new assessment was down £2,500.  The combined loss of income for 1931 plus extra expenses plus the Main Road Debt amounted to £900.
