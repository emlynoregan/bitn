Redruth Court, 19 August.

Benjamin Gully was charged with having possession of two fowls reasonably believed to have been stolen.  [From Mr W. Short.]

W.J. Short missed two fowls from his yard on 12 August, out of 22.  The door had been opened and tracks of a man were seen.  Reported to police and on Wednesday he believed he saw his fowls at the defendant’s.  But when the police arrived could only find one of them.  William Thomas gave evidence he kept fowls and had missed three on Tuesday: the door had been broken and the thief had left tracks.

On Wednesday he went with the police and identified two he believed were his.

T.A. Gregg, licensee of the Bon Accord Hotel similarly identified one of two fowls he had missed.

The accused stated he was a labourer at the quarry earning 9/- a day.  He had lost only two weeks work in the last 12 months.  Until six weeks ago he had lived with his mother, 500 yards away.  He swore he owned all the fowls and geese and gave details of how he identified them etc.  He did not claim the speckled hen: [which had been identified by Gregg] it had joined his fowls, having been loose in the paddock.  His fowls are sometimes mixed with Rule’s as there is no fence between the places.

Edith Gully, wife of the accused, corroborated his story.

Mr Hann for Gully would have called Mrs Gully Sen., ‘but unfortunately, that lady suffered with her heart and they were afraid that if she were put into the box there would be an explosion.’

The accused had been charged with having two fowls in his possession, but evidence having been tendered about four the information was bad and the case was dismissed.
