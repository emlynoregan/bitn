‘Vox Kooringanna’ writes from Burra Burra 5 July 1849.

When will the new Government township of Redruth be open for public sale?

Why are private capitalists barred at present from purchasing allotments in the township of Aberdeen, which was announced some time ago to be for sale by private competition or otherwise.?

[The editor feels sure that professional parties involved will furnish answers.]
