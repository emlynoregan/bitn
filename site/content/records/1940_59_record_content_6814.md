Burra Institute

At the meeting on Wednesday night last the ratepayers were unanimously in favour of the proposal put for the Town Council to take over the Institute.  The Mayor explained the proposal [as reported in the 22 July 1941 issue of the Burra Record.]  The library would not come under the control of the Council, but would have its own committee on which subscribers would hold the balance of power.  Cr Marston also addressed the meeting and added that although there was every possibility that the State Bank would agree with the proposal, it has yet to be endorsed by the Board of Directors of the Bank, who might decide to vary the figures slightly. Based on a debt of £3,200 the repayments would be at the rate of £102 in 60 half-yearly instalments.  The interest would work out at about 4½%, which was about ½% better than that now being paid by the Institute.  The present repayment rate would see the Bank receive £4,800 over thirty years, without the debt being paid off.  Under the proposed scheme the interest would amount to £2,920 and the capital payment to £3,200 for a total of £6,120.  Subtracting the £4,800 that the Institute would pay in interest alone meant that the Council would become the owner of an asset valued at about £8,000 for an additional expenditure of £1,320.  How would the Council find the £204 per year required?  It presently pays £36 p.a. for rent to the Institute.  The Institute pays interest of about £158 per year.  This accounts for £194, meaning that the Council will have to find an additional £10.  Recent changes to hire arrangement for Burra Talkies will bring in an additional £60 per year.

Cr Kellaway also spoke in support of the proposal.

Cr Lott said he considered there was no reasonable alternative to the proposal.

Mr Riggs as Secretary to the Trustees of the Institute also addressed the meeting.

He said the present debt was £3,161-15-9 and the half-yearly interest was £79-2-1.  On present indications receipts would not enable them to pay the payment due on 1 October until sometime in December.  In 1926 the loan had stood at £3,100 and in 1931 had been reduced to £2,795-5-3.  By 1935 the arrears of interest were £366-13-0.  In 1936 this amount was capitalised and the mortgage renewed for five years.  After 20 years of committee management the liability amounted to £61-15-9 more than the original loans and the capital had been reduced by £304-14-9.

Last January at the annual meeting of subscribers no committee had been formed and under the Act the Trustees had to act in that capacity.  The State Bank refused to write off any of the capital, reduce the interest rate or to exercise their rights under the mortgage.  The Bank also declined an offer by His Worship of £2,500 cash for the building.

A conference had been held between the Minister of Education, the Premier, His Worship, Mr McDonald MP, himself and one other trustee.  The Premier decline any action and the Minister had suggested that the Council take over the Institute.  That had resulted in the present meeting.

The problems had largely followed from the failure of the State Government to pay subsidies during the depression years after a portion of the loan had been raised.

At the present time A.A. Davey was in charge of the Library and would remain so until either the State Bank or the Council took over.  His salary had been raised by 10 shillings a week following the drastic cuts made to it during the depression years.  He had been in the job for 54 years.

The cottage [on the Institute ground] was presently untenanted, but had been let for 13/6 a week in the last six months.

Renovations and fresh seating for patrons were long overdue.

Mr J.E. Pearce asked what the caretaker’s position would be under the new award if the Council took over and was told the award was now £234 p.a.  [£4-10-0 a week.]

His worship said that the caretaker’s job was not a full-time one and a man could not hold down both the caretaker’s job and the Librarian’s job.  The Council would have virtually no control over the Library and he took it that the jobs would be split.

A.L. Walker asked if the Council thought £500 would be an acceptable amount for the cottage.  The Mayor said that last year it had earnt £35 in rent or 5% on £700.

Messrs Jennison and Jeffery thought there had been sufficient consultation and that if the meeting agreed the Council should take over the Institute without further consultation – though of course the ratepayers could demand a poll.

When the question was put to the meeting it was carried unanimously.
