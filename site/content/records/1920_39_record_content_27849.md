Obituary.  Mr George Lord who died a fortnight ago at Toorak Gardens took a keen interest in sport while resident in Burra and especially in the Rifle Club of which he may be regarded as the father.  He was a great worker for the war effort and his practical support aided greatly the success of the great days then held.  He was born in Devonshire in 1857 and migrated to Australia with his family when 9.  After marrying he lived at Moonta, Broken Hill and Pt Germein before coming to Kooringa.  He retired 10 years ago.  He is survived by a widow and of a family of eight only three survive: Mrs W.H. Sandland of ‘Heathmont’ & Messrs Will & Cecil Lord of Adelaide.  Mrs Ridgway of Prospect is a sister.
