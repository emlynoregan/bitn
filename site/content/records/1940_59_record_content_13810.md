Burra & District Soldiers’ Welfare Committee has discussed finances which are getting low.  The Buffalo Lodge Ball on 13 august will provide its proceeds and a badge day on 16 July will help.  Burra North Dance Committee contributed £12-9-9, plus an anonymous donation of £1.  Very little else has come in now for 12 months and there are still about 30-40 soldiers to farewell.  The committee also wants a considerable sum on hand to welcome their return after the war.
