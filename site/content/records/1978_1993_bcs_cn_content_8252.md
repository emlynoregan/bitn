Robert Dempster of Broken Hill delivered a letter of greeting from Mr P.L. Black, Mayor of Broken Hill to the Burra Burra DC on the occasion of Broken Hill’s centenary.  It was received by the District Clerk Mr Don Roberts.  Mr Dempster left Broken Hill on 7 August and arrived here on 17 August – the accompanying photograph shows a man and a horse so presumably that was his mode of transport.]
