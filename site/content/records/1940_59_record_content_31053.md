Queens’ Competition Wind-up Dance.  At the RSL club rooms on Saturday the Queen of the Navy was crowned the winner with 12,705 votes.  Queen of the Army was 2nd with 11,657 and Queen of the Air Force 3rd with 8,980.  All told about £138 was collected for Anzac Sports.

Burra Anzac Sports, organised by Burra Sub-Branch RSL were revived on Saturday after a number of years.  The weather was ideal, but the fixture was not as financially successful as in bye-gone years.  £77 was taken at the gates and the program ran smoothly.  Cycle entries were poor.  Foot races also seem to be declining in popularity.  Results are printed and conclude on page 8.
