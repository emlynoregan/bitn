Local Industries No. 3: Burra Fire Brick & Clay Co.

The proprietors have a lease on 40 acres of land known as Chalk Cliffs in the Hundred of Baldina and 13 miles east of the town.  It is said there are millions of tons of clay of superior quality for fire purposes.  They also have a three-year lease on premises near the Burra railway station with a good well of water and several outbuildings.  They have there a large Chilian [sic] Mill for crushing clay and preparing it.  We understand they have an order for 7,000 large fire clay limps for locomotive fireboxes.  Years ago the material was largely used at the local smelting works and proved first class.  We cannot say yet how the company will proceed, but there is a huge demand for bricks at Broken Hill, Port Pirie and elsewhere and we can only hope it will be a source of wealth for the town.  W. Shearing, the Hindmarsh brick maker has visited and said he had great expectations of it.  He said there were millions of tons of the clay, which might be exploited for 50 years.  The sample seen of bricks made from it was very good and he was quite satisfied with the clay.
