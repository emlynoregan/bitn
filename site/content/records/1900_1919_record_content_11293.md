Burra Mine.  The operations near the hospital are damaging the building.  A large portion of plaster has been shaken from the main ward and the mason work of the ward is in a very dangerous state.  The Board have asked that operations cease and have also asked for an inspection by the Superintendent of Public Buildings.

The shaft is down about 26ft, but so far there is no trace of ore.

Work on the main shaft progresses steadily, but prospects there are not as good as they were some time ago.  The Mine is presently employing only 13 men and boys, so that work is inevitably slow.
