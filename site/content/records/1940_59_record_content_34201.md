Burra Town Council, 1 December

Aberdeen Tennis Club requested permission to use the courts on Sundays.

It said it was losing members to Mt Bryan because they could not play on Sundays.

Cr T.H. Woollacott opposed it and thought a by-law forbade it.  Cr S.J. Woollacott seconded.

Cr Bevan asked if there were such a by-law.

Cr Marston amended that play be allowed on Sundays from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. and said that in 1938 or thereabouts they had allowed cricket to be played on Sundays at Victoria Park.  Cr Bevan seconded.

The Mayor objected – he lived nearby and did not want his Sabbath upset through people playing tennis.  The Mayor said if granted the request would be the end of the Aberdeen Tennis Courts.  When the 40-hour week came in people would have plenty of time for tennis.

Voting for the motion and the amendment was even: Bevan, Marston & Lee supported the amendment and T.H. Woollacott, S.J. Woollacott & E.T. Baulderstone supported the motion which was then carried on the casting vote of the Mayor.

Monster Continental at Mrs S.M. Sandland’s ‘Heathmont’ was an outstanding success.  It aided ‘Maureen O’Hara’ (Miss June Dollman) and her drive for Red Cross Hospital Funds.

Pte William Arthur Jarmyn who enlisted from Mt Bryan soon after the outbreak of the war has been awarded the Military Medal.  He was one of three brothers who enlisted in the AIF.  The MM was given for outstanding bravery in the Greece-Crete Campaign where he held a bridge with the aid of a machine gun for three days.  He was captured and placed in an Italian POW camp from which he escaped, but was captured and placed in a German POW camp.  He now lives with his mother on Semaphore Road at Exeter.
