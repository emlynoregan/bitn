Burra High School Speech Night was held 16 December at the Town Hall.  The Headmaster Mr H.O. Pederick outlined the year’s achievements.  The 2nd Year Class presented the play Money Makes a Difference.  Mr A.B .Riggs spoke briefly as Chairman of the High School Council.  Mr G.S. Hawker MP also spoke briefly.  Further items were then presented by students.

Mr Pederick said the year started with 75 on the roll, but 18 left during the year, some being removals, but others to jobs.  He emphasised the need for disciplined hard work at school and at home and feared that wireless was a distraction.  Last year only seven sat for the Intermediate and four girls gained a certificate.  One boy got six subjects, but missed the compulsory English.  Results in Craft & Drawing examinations were excellent.  Malcolm Goodridge topped the state in Intermediate Woodwork.  Sylvia James came second in Intermediate Needlework.

The yard has been asphalted this year, making playing conditions much safer and the school tennis courts were resurfaced.  The Assembly Room will be re-floored during the Christmas Holidays.  The Library has been refurnished.  The Parents & Friends’ Assoc. raised £150 and conducted a very successful High School Ball.  They also fed over 500 at the Inter-High School Sports Day and sent them away well satisfied.  Library books worth over £50 were purchased and a piano worth £145 was bought.  The Woodwork Centre gained an electric grinder (£27) and a strip film projector has proved very valuable.  Two great supporters of the school died during the year: Mrs I. Gare, who was Treasurer of the Parents & Friends Assoc. for several years and Mr Max Morton, who always took a keen interest in the boys of the school.

The Students’ Progress Assoc. obtained the materials for and then made a table tennis table and two deck tennis courts were levelled by the boys.  The school’s Sports Day was most successful.  Donald Edwards and Bruce Stock tied for Senior Boys’ Cup.  Coralie Ellis won the Senior Girls’ Cup.  Robyn Tattersall gained the Junior Girls’ Cup and Trevor Franklin the Junior Boys’ Cup.  The Inter-High School Sports were held at the Burra racecourse, and Burra came a close third to Clare and Balaklava.  In inter-school games Burra won the football against Clare for the first time in many years.

Old scholars and one teacher who gave their lives in WWII were honoured on Arbor Day with an avenue of trees.

The First Year Class again visited ‘Pencarrow’ courtesy of Mr E. Finch, to see shearing operations and prizes for writing about this visit went to Meryll Jackson, Kevin Williams, Shirley Richter and Barrie McElroy.  A Camera Club was formed during the year.

[Donors of prizes are then listed.]

At the end of the year we lose Miss C. Milazzo after one year here.  She will be replaced by Miss J. Hallewell from Jamestown.
