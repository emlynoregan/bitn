Railway Accident.  A man fell from the platform of a carriage travelling at 33 m.p.h. near Mannahill on Friday.  The train stopped, but he could not be found.  Amazingly he regained consciousness on Saturday morning and was picked up by a passing train and sent to Adelaide with a badly cut face, but otherwise without serious injury.
