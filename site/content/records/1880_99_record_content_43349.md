St Mary’s held a Strawberry Fete at the Recreation Ground in aid of the building fund for a schoolroom to be erected for the church.  This was described as a novelty for Burra and involved many weeks of preparation.  It was opened by the Mayor, Mr W. West.  The fete consumed over 2 cwt of strawberries [Over 100 kg.], some gallons of cream and a quantity of sugar.  Several large tents were procured from Adelaide and the strawberry effort was supervised by Mrs J.M. McBride and her family.

Next door were tents for tea and dinner under Mrs P.L. Killicoat aided by Mrs T. Sandland and the Misses Cave, Bampton and Gebhardt.

‘At times the tea-fight raged so furiously that access to the desideratum was impossible and seats were at a premium.’

Other stalls sold fancy goods, lollies and produce and unsold goods were disposed of by a Dutch auction conducted by W.G. Hawkes.

Misses Coglin and Sprod controlled the liquor traffic, yet we did not see a single case of insobriety – remarkable considering the variety of beverages sold.

There was a Maypole Dance and also an Aunt Sally, quoits and pony rides.

The Burra Brass band attended and so did the Mounted Infantry, which went through manoeuvres.

At least 900 people passed through the gates.
