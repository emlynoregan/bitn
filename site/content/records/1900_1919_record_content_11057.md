Redruth Court, 17 August

Patrick Cull alias John Flannaghan (18) and John Joseph Barton alias Albert Thompson (17) both of Brooklyn Park were charged on the information of James Macklvie with the larceny of a pair of trousers, pair of scissors, one pannikin, one comb, one brush, one towel, one reel of cotton & needles, one shirt, 4lb of sugar and one waterproof sugarbag, totalling in all to the value of 15/-.

James Macklvie said he was camped in a hut on Princess Royal estate on 14 August when the thefts took place.

M-C Grosser described tracing the accused to a point near Point Pass and finding them with the stolen articles.  Cull had tried to escape, but halted when three warning shots were fired.  The pair had escaped from Brooklyn Park Reformatory last July.

Both had told a reporter for the Record that they would rather go to gaol than back to the Reformatory, but that is where they were sent.  It was Barton’s second attempt to escape and Flannaghan’s third.
