Burra Town Council, 19 June

The Town Clerk reported the financial year would end with a debit of £109 showing a gain for the year of £430.

The Mayor in response to a question from Cr Lott said the Council representatives had not as yet heard anything about a date to meet the swimming pool committee.

The desirability of fitting the Council truck with twin rear wheels was discussed without resolution.

Other minor matters were dealt with.
