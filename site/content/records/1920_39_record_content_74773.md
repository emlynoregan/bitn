Anzac Commemoration Service, last Sunday at the Soldiers’ Memorial Kooringa

A large crowd assembled for the 24th anniversary.  The commemoration has for some years been held in Burra on the Sunday after Anzac Day because many of the returned men in the district go to the march in Adelaide on Anzac Day.  The returned men led by Stanley Hawker President and K.C. Sandland Vice-President of the local RSL sub-branch marched from the RSL rooms to the hospital preceded  by the Waikerie Band under J.H. Murison.  Next came the local troop of 9/23 Light Horse under Sgt Major R.G. Bernhardt and then the Girl Guides.  The only resident returned nurse, Sister Doug. Keynes (nee Sister Armstrong) marched between the two leaders.  The service was shared by Rev. C. Gray (Anglican) and Revs J.A. H. Andrews & V. Secombe (Methodists).  Rev. Gray gave the address.  Bugler W. Stanley late AIF of Waikerie played Last Post and Reveille.
