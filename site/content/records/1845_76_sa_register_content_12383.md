Kooringa News, 1 June

On 30 May Mr Selwyn, the Government Geologist for Victoria, and Mr Goyder, the Assistant Surveyor General, visited the Burra.  After an inspection of the surface of the Mine they applied for permission to go below, but were refused because they brought no order from the Directors, although one had been promised.  The next day they continued for the Eastern Plains to Noorkongoree or Hell’s Gates (Mr Chewings’).  After examining the country they came down by Hallett’s Hill, Mt Bryan and thence to Canowie to the Broughton and Messrs Bath & Bosance’s mine, and also where a recent claim for a gold discovery has been made.  They will then proceed north to mines there.

The inhabitants of Redruth and Aberdeen are getting up a petition for a bridge over the creek, to connect the Government Township (Redruth) with the main line of road.

The mail continues to run very late; it did not arrive till 10.30 p.m. today.
