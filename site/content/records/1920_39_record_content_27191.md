Burra Town Council, 6 June

S. Baker was granted permission to erect a building in East St.  (Cr Woollacott was the contractor.)

There was concern that some of the work in the Overseer’s report was poorly done and had not been seen by him.  There was then a debate on the fact that Council provided the Overseer with no way of getting about the town and it was therefore hard for him to see all the work done.

Cr Woollacott expressed concern that people with horses did not want to see the roads tarred right across.

Trees from H. Rabbich’s to the station are to be lopped high enough for traffic to pass under them.

The Mayor said judging by the number of men asking for work there must be a large number unemployed in the town.

A good deal of road work and other jobs had been passed, but not done.  Tenders are to be called for raising metal.

A silent cop is to be placed at the Kooringa Hotel corner.

The footbridge near the black bridge is to be attended to.

Telegrams of congratulation sent to Sir John Melrose and Mrs Wilkins as the mother of Sir George Wilkins.

Cr Riggs gave notice that he would move the clause calling for the Aberdeen Croquet Club to pay rates and taxes be rescinded on the grounds the arrangement made would virtually convert the grounds to parklands.

Allan Gebhardt won the tender for adjusting boundary fences in New Aberdeen.

The decision on a bridge near Finch’s past the cemetery was deferred, as the proposal from a city engineer was deemed too expensive.

There was quite a discussion on whose duty it was to run up the flag for the Council on appropriate days.  The Town Clerk said it was not his.  A motion was passed that the Town Clerk see that the flag was flown when necessary.
