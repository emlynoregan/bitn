Market Square redevelopment has begun with the undergrounding of power lines.  This will add to the aesthetics of the area and enhance the heritage value said Mr John Brak.  It would also reduce ETSAâ€™s maintenance costs.  The Council wanted to underground power lines where possible and in 1980 had done so along Bridge Terrace to restore the streetscape to as close to original as possible.  [Photo.]
