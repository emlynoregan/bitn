Burra WCTU has sent a deputation to the Burra Show Society objecting to the provision of liquor at the show and seeking the prohibition of alcohol at the showgrounds.  The petition contained 328 signatures.

The King had banned alcohol from the Royal Household for the duration.

The President could not say he was pleased to be waited on and it was a matter for the committee to decide.

The society was hard put to make ends meet with the war, the recent drought, loss of the £20 Government subsidy and this request would cost a further £20.  The calling of a meeting required 14 days notice.  He suggested the temperance people buy the liquor booth themselves – they had wealthy members – Mr Thomas for example could put up say £50.  Rev. J.C. Jennison thought this a bit hard when last time it went for £10-£15.

The President [I.J. Warnes] said Mr Thomas could bid £25, but ‘we know he’s a liberal man and out for the cause’.

Also they could all join the Show Society and change things that way, but there was nothing he could do for this year.
