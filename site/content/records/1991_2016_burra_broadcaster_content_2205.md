The J150 Committee plans for Burra in 1995 look like giving the local economy a boost.  Many of the events will require catering services and visitors are expected for the New Year’s Eve Party, a Gem & Mineral Show and a Craft Exhibition, as well as for the major event in September to commemorate the firing of the first lode in the ‘Monster Mine’.
