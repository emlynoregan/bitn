Burra Defence Rifle Club is keen to get going, but the Government is dilatory in assisting the organisers.  So far Capt. Lord of the Burra Hotel has given a gold medal and Mr B.W. Pearse of Caroona has given a silver cup to the value of Â£3-3-0.  The contest to decide the winner will take about 12 months.
