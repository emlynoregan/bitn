There is a lengthy report of about 2⅓ columns.

Cr Hardy introduced a new by-law re hawkers.

Cr Sampson thought it was the same as Cr Linkson’s of the previous year, and that had been judged ultra vires [Beyond their legal power] by the Crown Solicitor.  Consequently he objected to the adoption of the committee’s report.

Cr Rabbich said it was not ultra vires: in fact it was in operation at Wallaroo.

Cr West agreed with Cr Sampson.

The mayor read the Crown Solicitor’s opinion of last year’s effort, which said that:

The fine was too large

Exemptions in favour of ratepayers were not allowed

Cr Rabbich admitted the fine was too large.

The report was finally received and will lie on the table.

Cr Sampson took up the question of the new stock road, which he said the DC had undertaken to fence and hand over free of expense to the Town Council.  [i.e. that part within the Town Council area.]  The road had now been opened, but this part of the agreement had not been honoured.

The Mayor read the minute, which did not refer to fencing the road.

Cr Sampson said that nevertheless there had been an agreement to do so.

Cr West substantiated Cr Sampson’s views about the fence.

The Town Clerk said he had spoken to the Chairman of the DC who had said it was not understood the fencing was to be done.

A motion was passed asking the DC to carry out the fencing.

Cr Rabbich then introduced a deputation from North Ward complaining about the way carting in North Ward was being carried out.  They said it was being done by people from outside the ward.  H. Pinch presented a requisition with 44 signatures.  The Mayor was surprised if that were the case.

Mr Pinch said locals had not always been used.

There was also a dispute over Cr Rabbich having authorised work in Taylor St without the approval of the overseer and the Public Works Committee.  This provoked a rather heated exchange between Crs Rabbich & Sampson.  The latter wanted Mr Tiver to be paid his £1-2-0 for cartage out of Cr Rabbich’s own pocket.  Finally the pay sheet was passed for payment.
