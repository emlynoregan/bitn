Electrical Disturbance.  A local citizen’s compass pointed south on the evening of Wednesday 14 July and when corrected it swung back.  It was normal again in the morning.  Considering W.E.D. Young’s strange experience within a few hours of this it appears there was some electrical disturbance in the vicinity during the night in question.
