BCS Bicentennial Day

Mr Colin Fidock was special headmaster for the day.  Fingernails were inspected, students recited the National Salute at an old style assembly and Matt Boaden was ‘caned’ for misbehaviour.  The children visited the reopening of the restored Redruth Gaol and were thrilled to see their Principal and Deputy Principal locked in gaol.  The afternoon activities were very successful and the Police Band gave a captivating performance.  Mr John Olsen presented the SRC members with Bicentennial Medallions at a final assembly.
