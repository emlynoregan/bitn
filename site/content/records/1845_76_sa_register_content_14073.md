Kooringa News, 20 February

I understand the Government has settled the question of the location of the Post Office by deciding to amalgamate it with the Telegraph Office.  While this decision is to be commended for its economy, it is unfortunate that it will mean the dismissal of our postmaster with the attendant loss of salary and also with losses he has incurred in setting up a new office on the understanding that he would be continuing in his appointment.

The discovery of the new lode at the Burra Mine is likely to prove a welcome boon to the proprietors, besides which it may well lead to further discoveries in a direction hitherto unexplored.  It is to be hope that it will have the effect of reviving the state of things here, for all tradesmen complain loudly of the stagnation of trade.

The Redruth Bridge makes steady progress with the piers now about breast high.  It is likely to be completed before the winter rains â€“ a highly desirable outcome.
