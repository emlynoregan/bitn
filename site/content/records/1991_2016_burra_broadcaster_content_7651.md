Anthony Thorogood – ‘The Rainforests of Burra’

A continuation of the article from the previous issue.

Why wasn’t Burra well wooded when the white settlers arrived?

I believe that the soil was good, rainfall adequate and despite cold winters, it was not by world standards very cold.

I believe the answer lies in the firestick farming practice of the Aborigines.

Fire encouraged fresh grass, which in turn encouraged kangaroos.  Early explorers like Flinders constantly mentioned fires.  Repeated fires, along with kangaroos, frost and drought killed tree saplings.

A rich black vein of rock on our property was tested and declared to be carbon – perhaps representing a long dead rain forest that died before the Aborigines came.

Sheoaks may have been quite thick when Aborigines first came and were thinned by fire.  Remaining trees were exterminated by settlers with sheep, miners with goats and pigs and a demand for structural timber and firewood.  I believe in planting trees, but not in the native grassland areas, which are a unique stockhouse of wild grasses and flowers with their own unique wildlife.
