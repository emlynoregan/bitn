Redruth Court, 9 February

Two local lads aged 13 & 15 were fined £1 + £1 costs for stealing 12 pigeons from an outhouse in Kooringa.  It was a first offence or they would have been sent to the reformatory.

Jack Herbert, who was rolling meat, received a nasty gash on the right hand from Sid Kuchenmeister who was chopping meat in Mr Kuchenmeister’s business on Tuesday.

Enid Morrison, daughter of Mrs J. Morrison, ran in front of a car driven by Mr C. Attrill on Tuesday in Market Square.  Though he was going slowly and stopped within a car’s length her face was scratched, she was badly bruised and a foot was injured.  The injuries turned out not to be serious.
