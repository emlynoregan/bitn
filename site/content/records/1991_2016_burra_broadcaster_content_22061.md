Burra School won the State Prime Lamb Carcase Competition held at the Karoonda Sheep Fair last weekend.  The winning pen was three wethers bred from a White Suffolk ram out of Merino ewes.  It was entered in class 3, which was for lambs greater than 23 kg dressed weight.  Year 12 students had selected the lambs at the start of the school year.  They weighed 53-56 kg on the hoof and 25.2-26 Kg on the hook.  The eye muscle scored 24 out of 25 possible points and yield scored 48 out of a possible 50 points.  The school wished to acknowledge Bob and Idrienne Neillâ€™s Wheetelande White Suffolk stud at Farrell Flat.  A couple of years ago they had given the school the sire and he proved his worth in the competition.  The mothers were bought from Stewart Catt of Booborowie as 5.5 y.o. ewes and were of Greenfields blood.
