Harold Foote sent a letter with a couple of old photos.  One showed Morphett’s Shaft with the big cable wheel and Johnny Green still in position.  He said the roofs were on the Engine Houses and their stair cases in place.  He said that when in the boys scouts they used to jump out of the top windows through the ‘shoots’ or were caught in ground sheets by other scouts.  The other photo showed the first Kooringa Methodist Church.
