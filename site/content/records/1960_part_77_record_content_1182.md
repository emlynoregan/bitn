The Leighton Ladies’ Committee held its annual meeting in Leighton Hall on 24 February.  Mrs F. Carmody gave the annual report, which mentioned a Saturday night dance, Mid-winter Ball, afternoon teas at football matches and a fete.  The fete raised £46-2-0, which was given to the Burra Hospital Fundraising Committee.  £148 had been given to the Leighton Hall Committee to renovate the kitchen and supper room.  All meetings had been poorly attended, but people turned up for the events.  Thanks were tendered to the ladies of the Ironmine Methodist Ladies’ Guild for help at the fete and in making new supper room curtains.  Financially they were in credit £120-14-6.  No member could accept nomination as President, so a motion was passed calling for a special meeting on 5 April and resolving that if no nominees come forward the committee would be disbanded.
