Kooringa News, 21 June

Inquest/Obituary.  An inquest was held at the Pig & Whistle Inn before Mr MacDermott SM on the death of a baby of John Harris Jun. a miner of Kooringa.  Ethlinda [sic] Harris had been put to bed on Saturday apparently quite well and at 5 a.m. was found to have died.  The verdict was death from natural causes.

[Ethelinda [sic] Harris born 3 April 1866 Kooringa: died 17 June 1866, Kooringa.]

Wednesday 20 June was observed as a general holiday by tradespeople, but no public amusements were arranged.

Three new mining claims in the area are looking well.  They are Scrubbers’ Creek, Yurolo: Murphy’s Mine about eight miles north of Kooringa and the resuscitated Narkara Mine.
