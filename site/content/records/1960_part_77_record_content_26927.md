The Transport Bills

The leading article discusses the Government’s proposed bills.  One sought to decrease the maximum weight carried on the front axle of a commercial vehicle and the other would impose a fee of up to 2 cents per ton/mile on transport competing with the railways.  The writer was against the moves, which were seen as ‘Forcing Centralization’.

Burra Youth Club will celebrate its second birthday with a party and concert in the Salvation Army Hall.

Thefts.  Burra police are investigating thefts of petrol from depots and of tools from tractors at Flagstaff.

Tony Wall, NSW Swimming Coach, sponsored by Rothman’s Sport Foundation, will visit the Burra Pool on Friday between 10 a.m. and noon.

St Mary’s.  A special Advent Service will feature special music on Sunday by a quartet comprising Mrs Kelly (soprano), Miss R. Reed (contralto), Mr A. Edwards (tenor) and Mr D.J. Sibly (bass).  Rev. G.D. Sibly will accompany on the organ.

Snakes are plentiful this year.

Leighton Tennis & Basketball Clubs organised a dance from which takings and associated donations have reached £67-18-0, with more to come.  The money will aid the Burra Hospital.

Marriage.  Valmai Williams will marry John Secomb on Saturday 4 December.

Marriage.  Gloria Moxham will marry John Rowe on Saturday 11 December.

Marriage.  Judith Field will marry Kevin Pope on Saturday 18 December.

Booborowie Methodist Christmas Fair raised £263.

Burra Hospital.  Phase II of the redevelopment will begin next Monday.  Work on this phase should be completed early in the New Year.  The casualty room has recently been repainted and a new automatic sterilizer installed.  Asbestos & vinyl tiles have been laid in the Midwifery Section on the floors of the four private rooms and the Labour Ward.  Effluent from the septic tank has been directed into a recently sunk bore.  Phase III of the redevelopment should follow immediately.

Referendum on a Lottery for SA.

Results for the Division of Burra: Yes 2722 and No 1960.
