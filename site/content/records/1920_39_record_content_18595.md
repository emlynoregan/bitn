Soldiers’ Aid Society.

Because the number of members has dwindled of late a motion to disband was considered at the meeting on 10 December.  The President, Miss Bubb, considered it was worth going on for the sake of assistance to the Royal Institution for the Blind and for Christmas cheer for returned men in hospital.  75% support for this view saw the society go into recess as usual until the first Thursday in March.
