George Purdy gave evidence of seeing the deceased in Riverton about 8 p.m. and that he was then under the influence of liquor.

M-C Henry Bushell said he had known the deceased to be drunk on other occasions and that he believed the deceased had fallen out of the vehicle and broken his neck.  The jury agreed with him and gave their fees to the widow who is left with five children in poor circumstances.  A subscription list has been started in Riverton.
