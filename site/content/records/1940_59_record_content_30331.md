Burra must have some industry.  Cr Carpenter said at a recent Council meeting that copper was at £116 per ton – higher than ever, and the Council should try to get the mine going again and if successful in that then to get another industry.  The Mayor Mr Jennison said the old Burra Progress Assoc. had passed on a lot of information to authorities on this subject, but the replies were not encouraging.  Cr Carpenter said too many young men were leaving because of lack of work.  Cr Kellaway said it would be hard to get finance for the mine.  He had worked there on his own account when copper was £127 and only earned starvation wages.

The matter will be brought to the attention of the MP for the district.  We think it is time Burraites forgot the dream of re-opening the Burra Mine.  Reports from all parties have said it is not a payable proposition.  A better proposal might be a woollen mill – though they need cheap power and water – both of which should shortly be within reach of Burra: the former from the Morgan-Whyalla supply or from underground and the latter from development of the Leigh Creek scheme.
