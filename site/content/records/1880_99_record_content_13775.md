Resumed hearing of the police v. Elijah White.

Patrick Murphy said the defendant had stopped him outside Wilkinson’s shop and asked him if he was going to subscribe to Young’s defence.  Refused to give anything and the defendant made use of bad language.  By then a group almost as bad had gathered round.  The defendant called as a witness Abraham Fordham and James Kennedy who said White had used language as bad as the defendant’s.

White was fined 10/- (or 48 hrs.)
