Weather.  Rain fell over the past week and was a mixed blessing.  Crops not yet harvested suffered and some fallow was eroded.  On the other hand pastoralists had many dams filled.  Most creeks ran bankers – especially in the World’s End area where flows are said to have exceeded the 1941 floods.  Sample rainfall figures:

Burra 157 points to this morning, Koomooloo 205, Quondong 108, Woolgangi 209, Mt Bryan 152, Canegrass 141, ‘The Gums’ 161, Braemar 186 and World’s End 150.
