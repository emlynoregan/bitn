Mr E.W. Dunhill’s 60th anniversary as a local preacher drew a very good congregation to the Redruth Methodist Church on Sunday evening, when he preached to the texts:

Go ye unto all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.’  And:

The Kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and He shall reign for ever and ever.’

A social hour followed in the hall, where Rev. Christopher had charge of the proceedings.

With him and Mr Dunhill on the platform was Mr Albert Dunhill, his elder brother from Norwood.  The speakers were: Mr R.H. Campbell (Redruth Circuit), Miss Beth Pearce (Kooringa Circuit), H.J.B. Jennison (as a former Sunday school scholar), the Mayor Mr W. Carpenter, Mr Sara and Mr M. Morton.  Mr David Sara presented a travelling rug and an envelope of cash.  The President of the SA Conference, Rev. R.E. Stanley, sent a letter of congratulations, as did P.H. Nicholls, Secretary of the Local Preachers Association.  A Certificate of Merit for laymen with service of over 50 years was presented from the General Conference: the first such awarded in Australia.
