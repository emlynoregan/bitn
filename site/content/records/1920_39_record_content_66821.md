Burra Town Council, 3 May

The school asked for the removal of a gum and a pepper tree at the corner of the street at the school house.  To be inspected before a decision.

The Baptist Union asked Council for the foundation stone of the old Baptist Church in Burra and for permission for Mr Carpenter to take it to Adelaide.  The Town Clerk said it was in the Council Depot wall and should be easy to remove.  Request granted.

The Burra Carriers Assoc. sought a deputation to Council to discuss matters arising from new by-law 23.  Council agreed, with Cr Dow dissenting, as it was a matter over which they had no control.

Council will receive a deputation concerning a weighbridge if suggestions are first submitted in writing for consideration.

The Town Clerk said a swimming pool site 120ft x 90ft had been pegged out.  The old ambulance shed had been converted for a Council Depot for property such as weights and measures.

The police agree with the suggestion of a white line in the centre of the road from the Monument to the existing silent cop and that corners as suggested by Council be prohibited parking areas and that there be no parking within 12ft of the telegraph pole in front of Drew & Crewes.  Under the new Act pedestrians must walk on the right hand side of the road facing the traffic.

The Mayor advised Cr Dow that the Town Clerk looked over Victoria Park once a week.  He said there was very little to complain about.  Crs Dow, Kellaway & Riggs disagreed and cited seat damage and stock eating trees.  People were continually putting their stock in the park.  No donations had been received towards the cost of floodlighting the monument.  The Mayor said funds were in the hands of the trustees of certain funds, which were now defunct and they should be asked to hand the funds to the scheme.  Cr Dow said one such group had promised Â£10.
