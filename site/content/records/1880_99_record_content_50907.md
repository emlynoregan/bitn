Pro Bono Publico’ writes accusing Mayor Rabbich of lowering the dignity of the office by insulting the North Ward Councillors and using a term like ‘pig-muzzled’.  He would best keep quiet especially following ‘that famous report of his at the beginning of the year’.  He is thunderstruck by the Council’s behaviour this year.  Cr Hardy never surprises whatever he does.  Cr Parks is a puzzle and should take a good look with both eyes ‘and not be led astray by petty jealousy and personal spite’.  He gave Cr Harris more credit for shrewdness and sense than he displayed at the meeting of 21 August.  The move to clear the room was merely to vent personal spleen on the Newspaper Man as he is called by the mover.  He calls on Councillors to act like men, not boys.
