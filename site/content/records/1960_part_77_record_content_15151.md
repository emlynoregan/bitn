A photo in the Home Mission Office taken thirty years ago shows a Federal Inland Mission vehicle in front of Parliament House Canberra and Albert Bell is pointing to the legend on the bonnet of the Didge Truck – ‘Derby to Sydney via the Granites’.  One is not surprised that Rev. Albert Bell should have been the first to cross Australia between those two points in a motor vehicle.  He was born at Hetton Down, County Durham, UK, on 29 December 1896 and migrated to WA where he entered the service of the Methodist Church.  The WA Home Mission Department appointed him a missioner to Kojonup in the far South East agricultural and pastoral area of WA in 1928.  The mission had only been established in the north of WA for three years when Rev. Bell volunteered to go there in 1930 and was appointed to the Kimberley Patrol.  He had an area of nearly 100,000 square miles and was at Derby in ‘the wet’ and at Wyndham in ‘the dry’.  At Wyndham he established a debating society with an average attendance of 100 and basketball and athletic clubs flourished under his infectious enthusiasm.  In eight years Rev. Bell made the Methodist Mission there widely known and respected.  He then came south in 1938 and married Ivison Holliday of Victor Harbor on 19 February 1938 and they enjoyed a wonderful partnership for twenty-five years and one day.  There was a honeymoon voyage to England in the sailing ship Pommern via Cape Horn.  On returning to Australia he became pastor to the Port Adelaide Central Methodist Mission and assistant to the late Rev. A.D. McCutcheon for eleven years.  In 1948 he applied for ministerial status and was ordained with status retrospective to 1938.  From 1950 he served circuits at Angaston, Red Hill and Hallett-Terowie, where he was beginning his fifth year.  He was an artilleryman in the Imperial Forces in WWI and spent ten months as a POW.  He was a member of the RSL and Treasurer of the Hallett Sub-branch, a Vice-President of the Cricket Club and Chaplain to the local Lodge of Freemasons, a member of the Hallett Institute and of the Bowling Club.  He was a forthright preacher whose sermons were original and arresting.

[Born 29 December 1896 Hetton Down, Co. Durham, UK: died 20 February 1963, Hallett.]
