Burra Town Council

The Aberdeen Tennis Club wrote asking the Council to repair one or two of the courts at Burra North.  The Council is willing to do so at cost price, but pointed out that it was having difficulty in obtaining the necessary supplies of Colas.

The Burra-Kooringa Methodist Church wrote asking the Council to make courts and lease them to the Church.  Cr Carpenter said the foundations of courts were already in existence near the bowling green.  The Mayor said if public funds were used then the courts would have to be open to the public and not just one section of it.

It was decided to lease the courts to the Burra-Kooringa Methodist Church at a peppercorn rent, as they stood.

In the absence of colas it should be pointed out that there is an alternative method of building courts.  We understand one was constructed by the late Noel Woollacott near the Adelaide Railway Station and is proving popular.  The foundation to a fair depth is mostly cinders and the playing surface is of brick dust and sand.  The courts are sprinkled frequently with water, because the wetter they are the better they play.  The water is quickly absorbed.  While dearer to put down than asphalt or bitumen courts, their upkeep is negligible. The bounce is similar to grass courts, but they can be used all year round and there is less wear on balls than on asphalt.
