Cr Dunstan thought it should not have been closed as it could easily be made into the best access to the top of Redruth Hill.  Crs Dunstan and Rabbich will report on the possibility of repurchasing it.

Morehead St culvert will be extended another 9’ in addition to the length build by the Road Board.

Tenders are called for kerbing and pitch paving in Market Square opposite the Burra Hotel.

Plans will be presented next meeting for the footbridge in Chapel St.

W.F. Coglin led a deputation asking for the Council to approach SAMA for a piece of land to use as a recreation ground, near the Model School and not less than 300 yards by 350 yards.  The sporting clubs would fence it and plant it.  J. Roberts and J. Snell spoke in support of the petition.

Two letters complained of carelessness on the part of the sexton regarding a recent interment.

[Somewhat unclear references elsewhere suggest that the fault was probably in the width of the grave which created awkwardness at the funeral.]

[Here runs onto page 3]

Mr Pearse has completed the Market St road (constructed for £385), though not to the satisfaction of Council.  Traffic has caused some unevenness where there had been much filling.  Council required such places to be made good.  Mr Duffy, the Road Board Surveyor wanted it graded and then 6” of top metal added.  He regarded it as only having the bottom metal completed.  The contract was however, only for 4” of top metal and the Council would have to pay for the other 2”.  The Surveyor should not be too exacting as the Board was getting a road for nothing in place of a much neglected road.  Ordered that the contractor complete the road to Council’s satisfaction.

SAMA is to be approached re a recreation ground.
