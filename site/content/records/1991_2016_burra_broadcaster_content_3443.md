The Redbanks Committee has been formed.  Redbanks is a very diverse area geologically and has interesting flora and fauna.  The Council wants to have it open to the public by 1995.

The Committee has the task of forming an Area Management Plan to present to Council.  Members of the public will be asked for their comments.  The reserve was closed by the SA Government in 1992 due to injury claims, etc.  A public meeting in 1993 recommended the Burra Burra DC should accept responsibility for the future of the reserve and as it was community land it should not be sold for farming use.  The use of motor bikes on the reserve was generally condemned.  Council accepted this recommendation.  An interim caretaker has been appointed.  Steve Kerrigan, District Clerk, said the Council took on the reserve on the condition that no off-road vehicles be allowed back into the area and so the committee will not be considering this question.
