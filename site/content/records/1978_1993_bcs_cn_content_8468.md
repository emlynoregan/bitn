Max Fatchen was the guest of Honour at the Burra Community Library’s 5th birthday celebrations.  Mr Colin Fidock and his industrious staff organised the celebrations extremely well.

Max read his poems and told stories and jokes, often about himself, to the Years 2-7 students.

He gave Miss Birgden’s Journalism students valuable insights into the qualities needed in an aspiring reporter and described the processes involved in the day to day production of a major newspaper.  He spoke of the job opportunities that might arise.

Mr Fatchen was judge of the first Literary Competition run in conjunction with the Library’s birthday.

Junior Section winner was Julie Gebhardt.

Senior Section winner was Steven Hosking.

Aileen Moorehouse won the Adult Section.

[Minor award winners are also listed.]
