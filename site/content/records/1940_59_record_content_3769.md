Burra Town Council, 4 November.

The mayor reported that two men from Mongolata had interviewed him with respect to the possibility of some work at the Burra Mine.  At present two men from another mining area were investigating its possibilities.  So far the Council has not been notified of any work being done at the mine.

The mayor thought more than two men would be required if the mine’s possibilities were to be explored.  He thought it would be a good idea to ask the Government to extend the scope of the work.  It was resolved to ask the local MP to interview the Minister of Mines on the topic.

Cr Lott said Finch’s corner was not safe and he believed the only way to avoid accidents was to have a stop sign erected for traffic about to go round the corner and across the bridge.

Cr March said traffic should be made to keep nearer the rotunda.

The Mayor supported painting stop on the road.
