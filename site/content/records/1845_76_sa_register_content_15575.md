Kooringa News, 23 April

Good Friday was observed as a public holiday.  While pious worshippers went to church, some lovers of nature headed out into the country for the day.

A temperance demonstration had also been organised.  The supporters rallied at the Bon Accord Mine at 1 p.m. where they were joined by the Kooringa Brass Band, which had been hired for the occasion.  They then marched through the streets to the Redruth Primitive Methodist Chapel, where Rev. Cole preached a temperance sermon.  After that the procession re-formed and they marched through the streets proclaiming their message until eventually returning to the chapel, where they sat down to tea with visitors and friends.  A public meeting followed, presided over by Mr Goss and addressed by Rev. Cole and others.

The Wesleyan Sunday School celebrated its anniversary on Sunday and Monday.  Services were conducted by Rev. J. Hancock and Mr W.H. Wilkinson Sen.  In the afternoon the scholars were examined by Rev. T. Lloyd.  On Monday the scholars and teachers with a band and flying banners made a procession through the streets before returning to the mission-yard for tea and buns.  Shortly before 5 p.m. the public tea began and continued for some two hours.  The public meeting in the chapel followed at 7 p.m.  Mr R.G. Wilkinson took the chair.

A planned lecture by Mr F.H. Needham on Recollections of the Russian War at the Institute on Tuesday evening had to be postponed sine die due to the absence of the speaker.
