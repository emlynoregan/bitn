Burra Primary School Council AGM

The primary school headmaster Mr S. Allan feels teachers need conferences and observation days because of rapidly changing educational ideas and improved methods.  About 35 parents and teachers attended the meeting.  The new council members are Mr J. Ayliffe, Mrs M. Alderson, Mr S. Allan, Mrs P. Buckton, Mrs E. Carpenter, Mr G. Nourse, Mr C. O’Connor, Mr R. Shipard, Mrs C. Stockman, Mrs J. Tiver, Mrs Betty Thamm and Mr Brian Thamm.

At their first meeting after the AGM the Council elected Mr I. Allen as Chairman, Mr A. Baulderstone as Vice-Chairman and Mr D. Lloyd as Secretary-Treasurer.

The Chairman’s report covers the Sports Day and Combined Sports Day at Hallett.

Rhe combined sports this year will be held on 13 April.

Swimming meets have been held twice at Riverton; on 24 March 1972 and 16 March 1973.  Burra won the first meet by 19 points and the second by 3.  The school competition at the Burra Pool was held on 6 December.  Fund raising for 1972 saw the men’s group raise and sell an onion crop for $159.  Snacks for visitors to the Copper Festival in October were a community service rather than a fund raiser.

Not as much has been spent on the school this year because the High School is to be relocated and the Primary School will be recast about the existing High school and Primary School buildings.  Also further clarification is needed about the division of responsibilities between the Department and the parent body for the supply of equipment and teaching aids.  Some additional sports equipment was erected.

Three new teachers were welcomed: Miss Dargie, Miss Abbot and Mrs Henderson.  Mrs Shattock, Mrs Keller and Mrs Short have helped during periods of staff shortage.

After six years as Secretary-Treasurer Lewis Moore was transferred from Burra and we thank him.  Don Lloyd has taken his place.  Committees have worked well and merit our thanks.  Mr Allan spoke on the planned activities for the coming year.  The full staff is now 8 teachers, 1 typist, 1 librarian and 2 teacher-aides.  The acquisition of two teacher-aides has been a tremendous help, especially in the Infant Section.  This year I intend to set up the old book room as an area for extra help lessons and as a room for group reading to teacher-aides.  Changing ideas and methods mean teachers need to go to conferences and observation days.  Children should have at least one excursion a year.
