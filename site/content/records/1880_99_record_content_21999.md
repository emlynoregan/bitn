In view of the report from the Hydraulic Engineer on the dispute between the Council and the Commissioner of Crown Lands, that the previous Council had accepted the old as well as the new works, the Mayor thought that they would have to accept the situation and pay £912 for what was really worth £300.  The matter was referred to the Waterworks Committee, which was given the power to act.
