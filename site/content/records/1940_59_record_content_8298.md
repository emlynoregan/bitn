Letter.  Lance-Corporal Jim Mannion writes to Mrs W.D. Ogilvie as a friend of her son Phillip and his winning the Military Medal.

He mentions discovering that Phil had passed on to his mother some letters members of the platoon had sent to him in hospital.  He hopes that Phil had exercised some discreet censorship and feels he must have done so, or his mother would not have found them so ‘really beautiful’.

He then gives a more detailed and colourful account of the action already noted that resulted in Phillip’s gaining of the medal.
