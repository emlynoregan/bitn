SA Mining Association

At the half-yearly meeting of the SA Mining Association on 17 October about 20 shareholders attended.

The Directors’ and Auditors’ Reports were taken as read.

The Secretary Ho. H. Ayers said there was more than enough produce in hand to pay the overdraft.  Work at the mine continued night and day.

At the extraordinary general meeting, which followed, consideration was given to selling various lands [as listed in the advertisement 5 October 1866].  The Directors said they had no immediate intention of selling, but sought the authority to do so.

The Karkulto Mine was not included in the properties listed.

Mr Samuel Tomkinson asked why Kooringa was not included and the Chairman said they thought it more advisable to hold that property at the present time.

Mr Tomkinson then moved that the Directors be empowered to sell the properties as listed in the notice of 5 October – though he would have liked to see Kooringa included.  Mr Henry seconded and it was passed unanimously.

Mr Glyde MP asked what the probable amount that could be so realised was and Mr Ayers said in round numbers it was between £5,000 and £6,000.
