The Directors reported that the prospects of the Association have far exceeded their most sanguine expectations.

In six months ore fit for exportation was: 	1933 tons

Ore reserved for smelting was:	723 tons

Of the ore fit for exportation	1799 tons	had arrived at Pt Adelaide

118 tons	was on the road

65 tons 	was at he mine

On 28 March	1197 tons	had been shipped to England

9 tons	had been sold

590 tons	was on hand at the port

Much more ore was raised in the past three months than in the three month previous and the quality of the ore is much improved.

The workings and operations of the mine were highly satisfactory so far as the Directors could judge from reports and personal observation.  At present workings consisted of 15 shafts from 14 to 79 ft in depth and 14 galleries varying from 15 ft to 240 ft in length.

The Directors were making every exertion for the completion of the smelting works, but building had been delayed by a want of bricks and of masons as well as the need to build cottages for miners and their families before the onset of winter, but they hoped is a short time to begin smelting operations.

The Directors had increased the size of the township of Kooringa to 40 acres.  Four stone cottages were finished and occupied and twenty-two others were in the course of erection.  There were also many temporary huts and houses.  The Directors have in contemplation the erection of a school-house, which may be used as a place of worship and the Government intends establishing a police station.  The Directors have leased ten acres of land for the purpose of building a hotel and have purchased sections 2002, 2402 and 3200 in the County of Light on the mine road, with a view to letting them for a similar purpose so that much greater facilities will be afforded to carriers.

The mining captain could not attend to all the duties of general superintendence as well as to the mining and so the Directors appointed Samuel Stocks Jnr to the office of Resident Director at a salary of £400 p.a.  The Directors have not delegated to him any power deputed to them by scrip holders, so he is as much under the authority of the Board of Directors as if he was not a member.  He took up office in February last, since when there has been a very satisfactory improvement in the management of the mines and a very great saving in expense.

The Directors have not thought it advisable to make an estimate of the real worth of the Association property until the first account sales of the ore is received, which will undoubtedly be before the next meeting of scrip holders.

The accounts for the working of the Burra Burra Mines amount to £4,495-11-11, for which upwards of 2,700 tons of ore have been raised.

Directors to retire by rotation are Messrs Penny, Bunce, Neales and Paxton and as Mr Emanuel Solomon has also resigned, he will need to be replaced.
