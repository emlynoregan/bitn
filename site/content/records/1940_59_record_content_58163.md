Burra Burra Show Inc.

The Annual Report from the retiring President, W.H. Lloyd, was read by the Secretary                 , F.N. Fabian.

The show on 11 October drew a similar crowd to the previous year despite rather unfavourable weather.  Receipts, at £184 were £10 higher.  During the year Mr F.N. Fabian took over from R.E. Angel as Secretary.  The grounds received little attention this year, but guttering was erected on the sheep pavilion at a cost of £48 and the old sheep and cattle yards were demolished and sold for £38.  The Badminton Club has used the Main Hall and they have painted the fascia and spouting.  They also donated £8 from a dance they held.  The outsides of other buildings have been painted.  Membership fees contributed £400.  The Show was well supported.

Two loyal supporters died during the year.  C.W. Gare had been a committee man for many years and W. Stockman had been a staunch supporter of draught horses in earlier days and of agricultural products.

The ring events drew over 300 entries.

Catering by Mr M. Burpee of Eudunda was very good.

The Bank overdraft at the end of 1951 was £580 and this had been reduced to £369 at the end of 1952.

Depasturing of sheep on the grounds brought in £99.

Elected were: President, W.H. Lloyd.  Other officers were re-elected and Mr Ivan Gare was added as a Vice-President.
