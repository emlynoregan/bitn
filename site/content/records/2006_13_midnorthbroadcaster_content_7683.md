Burra Antique Fair was opened by ABC radio personality Peter Goers.  It was the third time he has performed this task, though in fact at the last minute he handed the microphone to one of his regular callers, Peter McCullum of Booleroo, with instructions to declare the fair open.  Peter duly found the words to do so, though he claimed that the only thing he had been asked to open recently was a cereal packet.  About 1,400 people visited the fair.
