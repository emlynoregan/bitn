Burra Town Council, 17 February

Sgt Kain (Redruth) asks on behalf of the Betting Control Board the Council’s opinion of the suitability of the billiard room adjoining the Royal Exchange Hotel as a betting shop.

Cr Dow thought there should be one at each end of the town.

Cr Jennison felt the site, which was in fact on the hotel premises, was too close to the hotel.

Cr Dow moved approval of the suitability.

Cr Jennison said the Act distinctly said a betting shop had to be a certain distance from a hotel.

The Mayor when asked for his opinion several times refused to be drawn.

Eventually an amendment by Cr Jennison drawing attention to the site being on hotel premises was carried.

Council extended its sympathy to the mayor’s mother in her illness and to Mrs Davey the wife of the Town Clerk in her illness.

Pepper trees that mask the approach to the Kingston St Bridge are to be removed.  [Just where is unclear, but the corner nearest Paxton Square is discussed.]
