The Local Economy

Burra is experiencing boom times at present.  The district income is greater than for decades.  Two financial indicators are:

More Scotch whisky is drunk at the racecourse bar than at many other similar meeting that the publican caters for, which means something at 1/9 a nobbler.

The town lies about 9th in the state, including Metropolitan Adelaide, for new car registrations and local motor traders are rarely called on to arrange terms for their purchase.

Miss Margaret Jeffery has qualified to compete for the title in the Miss SA Quest.  Donations have reached Â£139-17-6.  She is studying for an Honours Degree in Science.
