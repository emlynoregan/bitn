Rabbits.

[District Council Rangers quite often changed landowners with failing to clear their land of rabbits, but I have noted few of the cases.  They were frequently defended and the results of such actions were by no means one-sided.  The penalties were quite severe, making the cost of defending a case worth the risk.]  For example:

Redruth Court, 13 April.

District Ranger for Burra D.C., John Morgan, charged Messrs Cockrum & Pearce, but they tendered evidence to show that ‘the act stated that owners or occupiers were compelled to continue killing rabbits until they were cleared, and that was exactly what the defendants were doing and there was nothing before the court to prove otherwise.’

The defence succeeded, but the attorney fees were £2-2-0, court fees 5/-, witness fees £1-10-0 to total £3-17-0.  The report doesn’t state whether the court awarded them costs.
