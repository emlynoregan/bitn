Obituary.  Alice Pearce, eldest daughter of John & E.J. Pearce, died at Leighton House Kooringa 17 March.  For some 16 years she had suffered from chronic rheumatism and was virtually confined to a wheelchair, but her death was sudden and unexpected as a result of an attack of diabetes.  She was born in Kooringa 28 July 1871 and was educated at Burra School and later employed at Samuel Drew & Co. (later Drew & Crewes).  She was greatly interested in the activities of the Methodist Church and was for a long time a worker at the Sunday school, which she represented when she laid a foundation stone for the new church.  She had also been organist for many years and had a good soprano voice.
