Fire.  Mt Bryan was awakened by the cry of ‘Fire’ at 3 a.m. on Sunday morning.  Soon a number of men arrived, but they could save nothing of the home of Mr & Mrs Dan Meers and could only prevent the fire from spreading.  About 6 a.m. they could spray water on the remains to secure the area.  Mr & Mrs Meers escaped with only their night attire.  Their daughter Margaret aged 4 hid under a table and was located by her screams.  Mr Meers in getting her out was badly burnt across his back as he shielded her.
