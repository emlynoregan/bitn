Burra Town Council, 3 July

The War Trophies Committee asked for the trench mortar [the squirt] to be sent to Kadina â€“ they are to be told it has been sent to Adelaide.

The Burra Hotel Proprietor says he will be unable to provide electric lights at the National Bank Corner and the Rotunda after 30 June.

The Town Clerk will endeavour to arrange supply from Mr J. Allen.

Commissioner Richards of the Salvation Army will be given a Civic Reception when he visits on 3 August.
