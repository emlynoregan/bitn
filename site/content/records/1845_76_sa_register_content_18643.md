Kooringa News, 8 June

Whit Monday was a general holiday among the town’s shops.

The weather was cold and dry.

Kangaroo hunting was popular.

The anniversary of the Bible Christian Sunday School was celebrated and was extensively patronised.

Mr Stanton’s injuries have proved less serious than feared.  No bones were broken and it a severe shaking from his fall that prevents him from returning to his duties at the Grammar School.
