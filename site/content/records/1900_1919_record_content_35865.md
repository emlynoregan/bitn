‘A Burra Resident’ writes stating that the late John Bell had been in town as early as Wednesday morning. The editor discounts this rumour and says police have made special enquiries and established he only arrived on the day he committed suicide, leaving some teams a mile or two outside of the town and passing straight through Kooringa to Aberdeen.
