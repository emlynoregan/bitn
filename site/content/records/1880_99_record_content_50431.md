Mounted Rifles v. Militia.  There is a discussion of the relative merits of these two organisations, concluding that 20 Mounted Rifles are worth 200-300 of the Militia.  This has been shown at the annual encampments, though these have been suspended for the last two years due to the depression.  The Militia cost £23,521 last year and the Mounted Rifles cost £5,088.  Savings could be effected by encouraging the latter with judicious spending at the expense of the former.
