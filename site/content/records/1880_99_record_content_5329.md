Editorial on the Municipal Election Meeting at Kooringa on Tuesday last.

The meeting was a miserable failure as the candidates appear to have no opinions, though some said what they would not support and these the only practical things suggested.

They oppose a loan and yet there are several important things that need doing apart from the badly needed survey of the town.

A bridge is needed in Chapel St.

A footpath from Aberdeen to Kooringa is needed

The making of the very bad piece of road past Mr Fussâ€™s garden in Llwchwr is needed.  [The road to Hampton]
