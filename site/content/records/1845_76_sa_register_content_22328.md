Burra News, 16 September

Michael McCormick, a well-known carrier on the Burra Road was charged with stealing three horse collars, five bridles and one harness, saddle and breeching from the SA Mining Association.

Thomas Bentley, the managing stableman at Burra Mine, said he had missed the articles and all were branded SAMA.  After obtaining a search warrant he and a trooper overtook the prisoner two miles from Burra on the North Road.  They found one of the bridles on the first horse and then Bentley and Trooper Dechert found the other missing items in the drays or on the horses.

Police-trooper Frederick Julius Dechert stationed at Kooringa gave corroborating evidence and Henry Dawson gave evidence as to the value of the items, which he said totalled Â£4-17-6.  The prisoner was committed for trial in the Supreme Court.
