Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co.  Eleventh Half-yearly Report.  The property is in a dormant state, but has perhaps better prospects than ever before.  Mr W.A. Horn’s £1,000 option does not expire till 13 May 1907.  It is proposed to spend £15,000 in nine months if purchase goes ahead.  It is to be hoped the mine will be completely dewatered and that a smelter will be one of the first things undertaken.
