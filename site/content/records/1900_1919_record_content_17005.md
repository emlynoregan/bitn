Paull’s Mine machinery has had a trial run with satisfactory results.  It is expected to process 500 to 600 tons per week.  Charley Fuss has been on the field for some three weeks and his writings to his brother August are full of interest and pithy.  Arrangements are being made for a second shift and the property is looking well.
