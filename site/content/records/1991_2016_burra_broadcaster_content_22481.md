Burra Medical Centre & Toilet Block will be upgraded.  Discussions have been held over the past two years between the Burra Clare Snowtown Health Service, the Council and Dr Tim Simpson.  Better access to both facilities was needed for people with a disability. Funding arrangements have now been made and tenders are being called to upgrade the footpath and the toilet block and surgery.  Burra Hospital, which owns the surgery, will help with funds from its capital account and the Council has included the project in its budget for 2000-01.
