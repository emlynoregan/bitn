Redruth Court, 15 June.

L-Cpl Thomas v. T.P. Halls & F. Schutz charged with breaking a lamp in Kooringa on the night of 28 May.  Mr Bright appeared for the defendants and Mr Pendlebury for the plaintiff.

William Davey, Town Clerk, identified the lamp and assessed damage at 3/-

Thomas:

I was near Ullman’s bakery on the east side of the bridge shortly before midnight and heard the sound of breaking glass.  Two men came across the bridge and I recognised Halls.  I asked him the cause of the noise.  He said he did not hear anything.

Thomas said it was strange and he believed the lamp to have been broken.

Halls said ‘I did not break no lamp.’

Halls said he did not know the other man on the bridge.

Thomas called out for the other to stop and on the third call he did so.  He was Ferdinand Schutz.  He also denied hearing any noise on the bridge and both went off while Thomas was investigating the broken lamp.

The next day Halls said he did not come over the bridge.

[The report then goes into tedious detail in which the defending lawyer sets out to show that the policeman did not actually see who was on the bridge and could not know that there was not another man on it etc.]

T.P. Halls:

I left the Burra Hotel at 10 to 12 with Fisher & Fenton, and crossed the creek on the footbridge behind the hotel and went to Kingston St.  I met L-C Thomas c. 50 yards from the Kooringa Hotel.  We met Schutz near Elder, Smith & Co.’s stable.  The next day the policeman accused me of crossing the bridge and breaking the lamp.  I did not cross the bridge and called up Fenton who told the policeman we crossed the hotel footbridge.

Halls accused the policeman of telling an untruth when he said he had seen Halls on the bridge.

Halls also denied it had taken three calls to get Schutz to stop.

George Fisher gave evidence to corroborate Halls.

F. Schutz:

I came across the bridge alone.  I heard nothing and did not break the lamp.  I saw the policeman on the north side of the footpath near ‘German Ullman’s’.  [This would appear to be the footpath on the south side of the street.]

Since L-C Thomas said he was sure Halls broke the lamp and yet the evidence of witnesses was strongly against Halls being the culprit, the SM said he considered Halls’ explanation satisfactory and as the policeman himself did not consider Schutz guilty he had no alternative but to dismiss the case, though he refused to award costs.
