The Burra Heritage Town Jubilee 150 Project will be opened by the Hon. R.G. Payne MP, Minister of Mines and Energy on Sunday 5 October at 1.30 p.m. at Morphett’s Engine House. After the opening guests will tour the building and then be taken to the other two sites of the project; the Bon Accord Mine Museum and the Kingston St Row of Paxton Square Cottages.  Period costume is to be encouraged for the occasion.

$150,000 was spent on the Kingston Street Row, which has been restored and adapted for holiday accommodation.

$30,000 was spent on the Bon Accord, largely for structural repairs.  A Museum’s Accreditation Grant of $8,500 from the History Trust of SA has been spent on displays.

The National Trust Branch at Burra has contributed about $6,000 to the Pam Marlow model of the Monster Mine at the Bon Accord Museum.

Morphett’s Enginehouse restoration has been described as unique in the Southern Hemisphere and possibly a world’s first.  [Although there are intact enginehouses in Cornwall, none there has been restored from a ruined state.]

Visitors will be able to visit the three restored floors of the Enginehouse and view the mine pool and Morphett’s Shaft from the balconies on the second floor.  The Department of Mines and Energy is providing funding to allow the timbering of the top 40 feet or so of the shaft and the eventual re-opening of the miners’ adit.
