Burra Town Council.

The Commissioner has refused to allow the Council to get the retimbering of the Waterworks well done.

The mayor reported that a gong would be fixed at the Aberdeen railway crossing.

Nothing has yet been done to lay water on to the Public School.

Permission granted for the United Friendly Societies’ Demonstration to use the oval.

Council agreed to let the Government timber the Waterworks well.

The Overseer of Works reports that the creek at Bagot, Shakes & Lewis’s was dammed on their property, diverting water from its natural channel.

E.P. Nesbit to take the necessary action to rectify.
