The Main Road to the North

Henry Dawson writes from Gumeracha, 13 June, commenting on the Central Road Boardâ€™s deliberations:

No 1 road seems to have a very poor claim.  It is the longest and does not run through agricultural land.  Are present and coming generations to be punished because of what was done on a bush road to meet demands in a then unsettled part of the country?  The middle line serves tens of thousands of acres of agricultural land on both sides and are the settlers there to be denied in order to benefit a mine that if it is working today might stop tomorrow?
