Population.  The election on Saturday showed how population in the district has fallen.  At the 1950 election there were 4,292 voters and on Saturday there were 579 fewer, or 3,615.

[This decline was corrected on page 2 to 429 instead of 579 after the receipt of postal votes.]

[The writer goes on to urge the necessity of stopping this decline through diversification and decentralisation of industry, suggesting meat, wool and wheat processing industries for Burra.]
