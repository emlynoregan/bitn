Cr Sampson moved the Council adjourn for the purpose of calling a special committee meeting to consider the matter as provided for under clause 44 of standing orders.  2nd by Cr O’Leary.

[A comment in ‘Sparks’ column would seem to imply that clause 44 related to declaring seats vacant.]

Cr Butterworth said he wished to introduce a deputation from North Ward.

Cr Sampson said they could not be received unless Cr Rabbich withdrew.

Cr Rabbich refused.

The Mayor thought they might be received.

Cr Watt then objected to sit if Cr Rabbich stayed and so did Cr Sampson.

The Mayor said they had come to heal the breach, but were prevented by Cr Rabbich defying them by taking his seat.

The deputation was exceedingly conciliatory and then withdrew.

Cr Butterworth then moved they go on with business.  Cr Rabbich 2nd.

Cr Sampson’s motion was then carried and Council adjourned.
