Obituary.  The Hon. John Lewis CMG MLC died at his residence ‘Benacre’ Glen Osmond on Saturday 25 August.  He was born at Brighton [SA] 81 years ago.  [12 February 1842.]  His primary interests were always agricultural and pastoral.  He spent years on outback stations after leaving school.  He was interested in Aboriginal welfare and in the preservation of the state’s flora and fauna.  He was a member of the Aborigines’ Friends’ Association and Advisory Council and on the Flora and Fauna Board.  He had interests in pastoral properties in Queensland, NSW, NT & SA.  He was for long a resident of Burra and whilst here was active in many aspects of public life.  He was a Town Councillor for three years in the 1880s.  [In fact he served one term for South Ward from December 1879 to November 1881.]

In business he was for 47 years identified with the firm of Bagot, Shakes & Lewis Ltd.  He believed strongly in hard work and brought his family up on those lines.  There are four sons and two daughters.  The eldest, Dr J. Brook Lewis, has attained a high rank in the medical profession.  Major Gilbert Lewis has retired to Bundaleer after a brilliant career as a soldier in India and on active service.  [Served in the Boer War & WWI.]  Essington Lewis is General Manager of BHP, one of the most important positions in Australia.  Lance Lewis was well known as an athlete and fine soldier and is Managing Director of Bagot, Shakes & Lewis Ltd.  Mrs D. Cowan, nee Nellie Lewis, had a most creditable war record in France and Jeanie is Mrs Alex Melrose of Kadlunga, Mintaro.

He was buried at Kooringa on Monday.  The body arrived by special train and there was a lengthy cortege.  Businesses closed in Kooringa from 2 to 3 p.m.  His four sons attended with sons-in-law and grandsons.
