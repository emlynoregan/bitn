Burra Town Council, 1 October

Burra Electric Supply Co. quoted the cost of moving a light near the bowling green at Â£7-13-6.  The matter was deferred as being too costly.

Burra Motors was permitted to install another petrol pump.

T.H. Woollacott was given permission to erect a motor garage for the Vacuum Oil Co. and a residence in Graham for A.S. Walker.

Cr Riggs gave notice to rescind his motion for a referendum to change the names of the local post offices to Burra South and Burra North in favour of a change only of Kooringa to Burra.
