The School looks forward to the establishment of a swimming pool in Burra.

This year we regretfully accepted the retirement of Mr Jack Fisher as Secretary of the High School Council after 15 years, due to ill health.  We extend out thanks.

The new High school Council saw H.J.B. Jennison re-elected as Chairman and Mr G.H. Cockrum became Secretary.

The Parents & Friends’ Association has given much assistance, including a new portable gramophone to aid in teaching typing, a lawn-mower, a record cabinet and about £30 worth of library books.  Mrs Ellis continued as President and Mrs Binks-Williams succeeded Mrs Lott as Secretary.

The High School Ball was again a great success.

Religious Instruction has continued and all the churches in Burra are represented.

The usual school excursion was made to the city.  In the morning the boys went to the Metropolitan Abattoirs and the girls to the GPO and in the afternoon the combined group went to the West Beach Aerodrome and the Southern Adelaide Hills and Mt bold Reservoir.  The Leaving Geography Class visited Pt Pirie and toured part of the South Flinders Ranges.

Visiting Day introduced the new High School Council to the school and students.

Senator R.R. Wilson visited on another occasion.

Adult woodwork classes were conducted by Mr R.L. Pillar.

Remembrance Day was observed in conjunction with the Primary School, when Mr Wilf. Nankivell represented the RSL and gave an address.

School uniform has been pleasing to see in the past two or three years and this year it was decided to institute summer and winter uniforms for girls.

A school tie has been adopted for boys and I would urge greater uniformity in the boys’ attire.  The uniform for them is grey trousers, blue or grey shirt, school tie and blazer.

For 1957 we are losing Mr Burdon, Mr Dean and Mr Pillar.

After the report the Second Year students presented the play Money Makes a Difference and the First Year Class performed Elegant Edward.
