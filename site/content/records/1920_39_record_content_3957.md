Burra Show Society, AGM last Friday.  30-40 attended.  The President thanked all for his election.  He reported the loss through death of two prominent members in Mr Thomas McWaters and Mr E. Cock.  During the year Mr L.H. Foote took over from Mr F. Treloar as Secretary.  It had been a good season; some said the best since 1870.  The sheep dog trials had good entries, but were marred by rain.  The financial position is sound with a credit of c. £40 after staring in debit c. £24.

The secretary said he had not handed over all prize money because of inadequacies in the stewards’ books that did not allow him to identify the winners.

Elected:	Patron	Hon. J. Lewis

President	I.J. Warnes

Vice Presidents	C. Bartholomaeus & Mr Radford

Elizabeth A. Ward contributes a poem The Morn of that Glorious Day April 25th 1915.
