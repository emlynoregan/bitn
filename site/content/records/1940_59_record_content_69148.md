Another vehicle was washed away at Gum Creek when Mr G. Brown tried to drive a buckboard across a creek near L.L. Martin’s property.  It ended up 15 yards downstream with only its roof visible.  Most roads in the Gum Creek area were impassable and on Tuesday Mr F. Dean, the Gum Creek schoolteacher, only had 2 of 18 students present.
