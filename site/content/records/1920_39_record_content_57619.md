Centenary

The Local Centenary Committee met in the Council Chamber last Wednesday.  Kapunda and Murray Bridge have also applied for the first week in October.  Government grants were intended for the beautification of towns, but not for building purposes.

The sub-committee suggested the program be:

Friday 2 October	Visitors greeted at a meeting at night.

Saturday 3 October	Procession and sports with an evening concert, dance and pictures.

Sunday 4 October	Church services and a sacred concert in the Institute in the evening.

Monday 5 October	School demonstration and exhibition with an evening dance.

Tuesday 6 October	Visits to Mongolata and other places of interest.

Mayor’s Ball and Bridge at night.

Wednesday 7 October	Burra Show, pictures and dance at night.

Thursday 8 October	Valedictory.

Dr Steele thought the ‘Back to Burra’ theme did not sufficiently advertise the district.  Films of the great sheep stations and other industries should be made.  He regretted there was no Concert organised by Mr Dane.  Mr Dane said that could easily be added.

Mr Bednall thought there were too many dances and one or two would be ample.

Some scheme should be evolved to beautify the town and stress the part Burra had played in the progress of the state.

Mr Dane felt more had to be done to make the two events of the Centenary and the Show complement each other.

It was decided that the General Committee would appoint the chairmen of sub-committees, who would then select their own workers and they consequently appointed:

E.J. Davey	Souvenirs and advertising

G.E. Dane	Musical

E.J. Harris	Accommodation

H.J.B. Jennison	Decoration and reception

The Mayor	Beautification

The Chairman of the Burra Burra DC was placed on the executive.
