Mt Bryan East Visit.  19 children, parents and friends from Burra Uniting Church had an enjoyable camp at Mt Bryan East School last weekend, despite the freezing temperatures and biting wind, which fortunately died down after sunset.

OSHCâ€™s Vacation Care Program provided something different every day.  Up to ten primary school age kids attended daily.
