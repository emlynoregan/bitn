Albert Gebhardt writes on the Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial.  He suggests each church erect a tablet or suitable memorial and the main sum collected be invested to provide a scholarship tenable for three years to be competed for by a Burra & District boy. £2,000 would yield £100 annually for a year’s education at a college.
