Recruiting Meeting, last Wednesday.

Mr Anstey said 95% of our boys will come back and promised preferential treatment for them from a grateful nation.  There was a scheme to train returned soldiers for farming.  A training farm had been set up at Pompoota and one at Mt Remarkable.  Reclaimed land along the Murray would be made available – a house, dairy cattle, pigs and poultry supplied to the value of £500 on a loan with no interest in the 1st year and then 2½% in the second year, 3½% in the third and 4½% in the fourth and then at the current rate.  The Repatriation Fund would pay any deficiency in earning and £25 free paid for furniture.  The Mt Remarkable training was for mixed farming.  Other options were aid in setting up a business and pig and poultry farms at Seaton were another option.

W. Hutley gave a short address.  If he could get 30 young men they could stay together as a Burra contingent.
