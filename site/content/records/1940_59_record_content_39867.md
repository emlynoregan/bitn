Burra High School Speech Night was held on Friday last in Burra Town Hall.  The School Hymn was followed by songs from the choir and then the Headmaster, Mr H.O. Pederick delivered his report on 1948.

The year had a late start due to the outbreak of infantile paralysis [polio] and as a result the Public Examinations were a week later.  This in turn has limited the preparations for this event and its concert program.  This means a less varied program has been possible, but instead three plays will be presented, one from each year.

The aims of the school can be summarised as:

To improve the culture of the children and train them to think for themselves.

To build their characters: to give them a high sense of right and wrong.

To help them become strong physically.

The year began with about 70 students, which was about ten less than the previous year, due less to a smaller intake than to those who leave far too early to take up positions.  I wish I could impress on parents that in allowing their children to leave in first or second year, they are depriving their children of a valuable asset that they would greatly appreciate later in life.  The trend extends across the state, but is more pronounced in country centres than in larger towns.  Of the 38 who started in 1946 only 8 took their Intermediate this year.  A few went to other schools, but most left school altogether.  In a changing world education and more education will become necessary and some other countries have realised this, with leaving ages in some as high as 18.
