Mongolata Goldfield

Francis O’Brien a prospector with thirty years experience believes that when the permanent lode is discovered it will continue to great depth.  This ‘miniature golden mile’ extends from Mr Rampton’s lease in the north to Mr Fred Lewis’s lease in the south and embraces all therein.  Two outstanding features are the Byles’ ‘Reward’ Claim which has produced most of the gold so far because it is more highly developed under its supervisor Mr James Salter.  The other is the mine of Messrs Barker, Hogan, Salter & Brown, situated midway between Byles ‘Reward’ to the north and Fred Lewis’s claim to the south.  Both have great prospects.  The job to produce good results belongs to the big mining companies and when more is known the big mining companies will operate her to the advantage of leaseholders as they will receive fair purchase prices.  He predicts the absence of cobalt and antimony and the presence of bismuth and slight copper means when cyanided the battery sands will yield a higher percentage of gold than usual.

In Parliament the Attorney General has said first-aid equipment will be sent to Mongolata and inspections will be made frequently.  Mr Bert James’s tender to supply 500 gallons of rainwater a week for £4 a week has been accepted.

The Peterborough battery has been overwhelmed with ore from various sources and at present there is a three week delay on crushing new ore from Mongolata.
