Broken Hill Radio Station 2BH broadcast live from Market Square for five hours on Thursday.  The aim was to promote Burra as a stopover place for people heading south to Adelaide.  Richard Daniel, the announcer said like many people he had passed through Burra many times, but only stopped long enough to buy a pie and perhaps feed the ducks.  In between playing songs Richard interviewed local people with the idea of talking about the many features of the town.  He and his assistant Phil Spur spoke highly of the support received from local businesses and the Visitor Centre who organised this promotional event.
