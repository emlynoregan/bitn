Obituary.  Mrs M.A.L. Feltus of Burra North has died suddenly after recently returning from a trip to the city.  She was born at Unley on 19 October 1852 as Martha Ann Linton Gray, daughter of the late Mr & Mrs J.R. Gray.  In her early life she came to the Mule Camps with her parents in a bullock dray.  He father was captain over the mule teams carting ore from Burra to Port Wakefield.  We understand the Mule Camps to have been in the vicinity of Koo-owie Station.  At the age of seven years the family moved to Burra, where Mr Gray worked at the Burra Mine.  Later he went to Bimbowrie Station with Mr Martin McBride, overseer of the station.  After that he returned to Burra, where he was Inspector of Cattle and Sheep for 30 years.  Mrs Feltus spent all her life in the district, where she married Mr William J. Woollacott when 21 years old, but they had no children.  She leaves one adopted daughter, Doris Vivian (now Mrs H.E. Tame of Adelaide), whom she took as a baby.  Her first husband died 19 years ago.  For 25 years she kept the Myrtle Maternity Home at Redruth until aged forced her to give it up.  In 1929 she married Mr A.B. Feltus, who died a few years ago.  She died at Burra Hospital on 10 August after a brief illness in her 89th year.
