Empire Day was celebrated at Victoria Park on Thursday.  Burra Primary School children assembled at the school at 10 o’clock and the Mayoress unfurled the Union Jack and the children sang The Red, White and Blue.  A series of patriotic addresses followed:

Dr Sangster (Chairman of the School Board)	Significance of the Flag

The Mayor, Mr John Drew	Loyalty

Rev. Father Redden (Catholic)	How Australia is connected with the Empire

Rev. Kessell (Methodist)	The Navy

Rev. R.C. Yeoman (Methodist)	The King

Rev. Ebbs (Anglican)	Heroic Deeds in War and Exploration

After the singing of the National Anthem they adjourned to Victoria Park for sports where they were joined by pupils from St Joseph’s Convent School, Copperhouse School and Burra High School [Bleak House].  Results are printed.

[Personal interest: among the winners were Kate Griffiths (Junior Burra Girls) & Doris Fuss (Burra Class IV).]
