Brian Moore of the Botanic Gardens Adelaide contributes an item on the question of whether Burra’s hills were always bald.

In 1846 John Ainsworth Horrocks noted that near present day Yacka there was very little wood for the fire and he noted that just north of Wirrabara the hills to the west were well timbered, while to the east they were open and well grassed.  Thomas Fisher in 1851 described the road north of Kapunda as passing through undulating park-like country and an extensive plain.  About eight miles before Burra he said it becomes very barren and hilly.  He described the hills to the north of the Burra Mines as rounded and bald.  The first surveyors of the district indicated that at least two thirds of the area was virtually devoid of trees and the vegetation was open and grassy.  Today little of this grassland exists and remnants are degraded and invaded by exotic weeds.  No grasslands are protected in conservation parks.  The Biological Conservation Branch of the Department of the Environment and Natural Resources has proposed a survey of native grassland and of grassy woodland communities in the Mid North, to run over two years.
