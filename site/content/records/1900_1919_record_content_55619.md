‘One Who Has Suffered’ writes attacking the Hospital Board.  If they could have their own doctor to treat them they would never have gone away.  Get Dr Ashton back and the hospital will be a going concern again.  Why does the Board object to having Lodge patients?  They always pay their fees and what if the doctor does get 2/6 or 3/- per quarter per patient.  He has to live on something.
