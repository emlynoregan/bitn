Kooringa News, 31 July

The weather last Tuesday was very stormy with high wind and heavy rain.

Some houses suffered damage to their roofs and so did the Court House.

Creeks were running higher than for some time.

The men started on the 26 July for the Nackara Mine as the new venture has been called, taking along horses, cart, water barrel and tools.  The £10 shares have been divided at the rate of £40 for small portions.  One quarter of a share sold today for £6-15-10.  [These last two sentences are incompatible.]
