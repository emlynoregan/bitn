Burra Town Council 16 April

Mr Peak wrote suggesting the need for a privy and urinal at the cemetery as well as some shelter and drinking water.  Rev. Howitt also suggested the advisability of a shelter under which a service might be held and asked what might be done to stop the sort of disgraceful behaviour of the crowd at the Cemetery on the preceding day at a funeral.  A tender was called for two privies, a urinal and a suitable place to hold services etc.  Police to be asked to attend when large funerals were held, especially on Sundays, to prevent misconduct.

Council will visit the Recreation Ground next Monday to see what is needed to make it available for football.  Also to look at the road through the smelting works and the footbridge behind the Burra Hotel.

10/- will be given to the boys who gave information on who broke the pump and the offenders are to be required to pay for the repairs.

A public meeting is to be called to determine the use to which the £372 in hand for a town survey can be put.
