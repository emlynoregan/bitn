Adelaide Share Market

The news of a strike at the Burra Burra Mine has affected the company’s share price.  The suspension of trading in them warrants our term of ‘nominal’ for their price at present.  There are sellers at £208 and buyers at £200.  Our private correspondent says the report in the Register last Wednesday was fair.  And a second received from Mr ________ is not a fair one.  He continues:

The public generally know little of the merits of the recent events here, nor of their probable results.  Though all is now calm, I do not believe the affair is over.  There is reason to believe the Directors have some hidden thoughts on which they will probably act, but they should beware of trying to over-reach the miners.  A general strike is not impossible and a sort of Trades Union has been established amongst miners of the several mines.

Princess Royal shares remain unchanged in value at £42.
