Liberal Federation: Burra Men’s Branch.  Last Friday at the Eastern Telephone Building Mr Radford took the chair.  Though in Federal politics the Federation might have to give up its individuality for a time, it must not be allowed to go out of existence.  Mr Warnes agreed.  W.G. Hawkes said that while he was taking a prominent position in the Citizens’ League he was also preaching the need to keep the Liberal Federation alive.  Mr Radford had been elected branch president in 1912 and after 12 years in office was retiring because he was moving from Burra to Canegrass, which would not allow him to give proper attention to the office.  Elected were President, S.H. Robinson; Vice-Presidents, G.G. Hawkes & E. Jettner.  The secretary Mr Edward had his allowance reduced by £5 to £20 on account of the difficult times.  (He was at the time owed about £10.)
