Mrs M. Klaffus of Bridge Tce celebrated her 96th birthday on 27 August.  She was born at Hahndorf in SA in 1856 [sic: error for 1846] and lived a strenuous life until she was well over 70.  Her mental faculties remain keen and her eyesight is good.  She does her housework and sewing, but recently has allowed a kindly neighbour to do her washing.  A small party was held in her house, organised as for some years past by Mrs E. Wohling and daughters and Mrs P. Borowski.  The Mayor dropped in for tea.

[Born Wilhelmina Mathildan Seelander 27 August 1846 Hahndorf.  Married Carl Christian Friedrich Frahm in 1877.  He died in 1886 and she married Carl Gustav Klaffus in 1891.  She died 7 January 1947 at Burra.]
