Burra Town Council, 14 January

Council spent a long time discussing the new system of assessing fees for patients at Burra Hospital.  The new system is to be based on an assessment by the Board of the patient’s ability to pay – similar to Adelaide Hospital.

Cr Robinson said the ward fee per patient was now 10/- a day.  Many patients did not pay this much and it was still to be the fee unless the assessment was that they were unable to pay.  The hospital had lost 28/- a month on each patient admitted.  The Hospital is to be asked to provide a monthly report to Council.

The Hospital wants the road in front of it widened, as it is presently so narrow it causes a bottleneck resulting in broken fences.  Council will inspect the site.

World’s End Creek has stopped flowing for the first time in 45 years – though pools of water remain.  The Baldina spring by the ford is still flowing.
