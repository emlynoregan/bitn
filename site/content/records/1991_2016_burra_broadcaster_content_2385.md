Tim Stockman has received one of the ‘Nescafe Big Break’ grants of $20,000.

Tim (20), from a farming family, has decided to make his goal the making of technology accessible to the average farmer by using his considerable skill in electronics.  His first innovation is a device to monitor the amount of farming chemical applied to crops by boom spray.  Present systems are inefficient and costly and although there is a computer device on the market, which increases efficiency, it is expensive and complicated to use.  Tim is determined to overcome these disadvantages and also to make the system safer.  The old system uses hoses full of chemicals, which can burst and shower the user with toxic chemicals.  Tim’s electronic device will eliminate the need for chemicals to be present in the cabin and eliminate overdosing.

Tim has already set up his own electronics repair business, but the grant will give him the kick start needed to finalise the project and further his research and development work.
