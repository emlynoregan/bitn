Hardy v. Davey (Concluded)

This paper deals with further examination of Hardy and the address of Mr Symon QC.

W.T. Rabbich was also examined, but to a long series of questions he claimed he could not remember.  The summary of the case by Symon is nice argument and makes good reading, even if it is rather long.  It extends about 4 columns.  Essentially when Davey took over the paper Hardy asked him for a job, offering to produce literary work, reporting, writing leaders and sub-leaders, sporting items, and to help ‘to work up outside Biz’.  When his offer was not taken up Hardy began a series of attacks on Davey and the Record in the Jamestown paper and in the Catholic paper, the Southern Cross.  The alleged libels by Davey lay largely in the latter’s comments on Hardy in relation to Hardy’s actions in Council and eventually in Davey’s publication of Hardy’s application for a job with comments upon it.  It is hard not to agree with the argument put forward by Symon about who is most libellous.  The report in the Record suggests that the packed courtroom found it all wonderfully entertaining with little work done in the town on the day and with frequent outbursts of laughter at the evident discomfort of Hardy and later of W.T. Rabbich, as well as cheers at frequent intervals during the QC’s final address.  It must have been a hugely humiliating experience for Hardy, but one which was self-inflicted and which resulted in his being non-suited.
