Burra Hospital Building Fund Appeal raised $11,311, of which the committee raised $840.  The Board is gratified with this sum, given the poor seasonal conditions.  When subsidised this will give a total of $34,000, which when added to funds already in hand will enable the completion of the building.  Funds in hand include a bequest from the Alice Collins Estate of $11,000, or $33,000 when subsidised.  It has as a consequence been decided to call the new building the Alice Collins Wing.  It will house an up-to-date X-Ray Department, Operating theatre and Casualty Ward.  Although funds will cover the building operations the actual cost of equipping the various sections is not easily assessable.  The overall plan is expected to cost $200,000 and of this residents of the district have contributed $11,000 for Phase I and a similar amount for Phase III.  With a bequest of $11,000 this makes a total of $33-34,000, giving $100,000 with subsidy.  Towards this end the ladies of various district committees which combined to form the Fund Raising Committee are to be congratulated on their annual effort.
