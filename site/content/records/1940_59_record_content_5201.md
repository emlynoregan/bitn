As for playing sport on Sunday: ‘outdoor exercise does us more good mentally and physically than any help from the church that Mr Gray has been able to give us.’

She also objects to any criticism of those taking part in ARP demonstrations and the like, as often they only have Sundays free from work for this.

She also believes there are many ways of doing one’s duty to God, apart from in Church on Sunday.  She believes ‘Mr Gray’s criticism and lack of co-operation is having the opposite effect from the one he wants and is driving people away from his church.

She goes on to explain why she does not go to church and it is not through a lack of reverence for God and His wonders, but rather of not feeling the need for any intermediary between herself and God.

‘Anything habitual loses its cogency.  Too much of what is said in church has been said thousands of times, and without inspiration or dedication.’  [A point she develops at some length.]
