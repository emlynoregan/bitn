Wilcannia & Points North, Part 4

[One car sustained damage and was stopped about 17 miles from Wongalilli.  Two people stayed at Myro for the night and the rest went on to Wongalilli, where they were welcomed at about midnight by Frank Heinrich.  The next day repairs were made to the car.  Mr & Mrs Billings made the party welcome at Wongalilli, where they admired the gardens, lawns and orchard.  They immediately had success shooting kangaroos.  There were also a number of interesting trees growing there: Mulga, Beefwood, Mustard Trees, Box Wattle & Eupanyah (phonetically spelled).  Plans were made to go on north to Goorimpa Station on a wild pig hunt.
