Booborowie Hall.  The local correspondent complains of the ‘small amount of public interest displayed in its welfare, the frequent desecration by drink besotted creatures’ and thinks it time it was treated in the light of a memorial as it was intended to be.

The hall earned £122-8-10 for the year and outgoings were £201-7-2.  State Bank principal, capital and insurance cost £62-8-2.
