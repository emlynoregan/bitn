Almost the whole of Mr Pearse’s efforts have been directed for some years to the raising of big framed strong-wooled merinos, which he has proved can be raised on saltbush country without special protection and are inured to the trials of a hot dry climate.  The had observed that wool in the east had a tendency to become light and thus lose character and he aimed to retain that character.

In 1890 he shore 38,000 for 500 bales and in 1909 he shore 16,000 for 420 bales.

For all the conservation of feed, less management work and labour and better supervision of the smaller flock he gained greater commercial value of the sheep for a cost of 80 bales of wool.  The average weight of shorn fleeces has increased 50%.

Last year 12,000 sheep averaged 12 lb each and the lambs a little over 4 lb.

This year they expect 13 lb and more than 5 lb respectively.

In establishing this flock Mr Pearse has secured the Koonoona and Murray merinos – large framed, grass-fed and strong wooled.  He has culled anything indicating deterioration and now rears his own rams with occasional imported stud rams from the Koonoona-Wanganella strain and aims always to breed true to type.

The flock of stud ewes of 450 should average 18 lb fleeces this year.

In a drive around the property we saw lambs five months old that were almost as big as their mothers.  These sheep are well suited to saltbush country and the lands opening back from the River Murray and the fame of the Pearse Stud is spreading.

Lambing at ‘The Gum’s takes place in March and April and this year there was a drop of 4,600 at a rate of over 90%.

Early on he suffered from overstocking, but has learnt that a safe rate is one sheep to 5 acres and now runs 15,000 to 20,000 sheep depending on the year.  This year he could have run nearly 50,000, but prefers to look at keeping twelve months’ feed in reserve.  Since the 1902 drought broke bare patches have been filling up and while the ground is not yet entirely covered, it does not bear the barren look, which is the despair of the pastoralist.

In the area fed by the overflow of Burra creek green feed persists to Christmas every year that has anything like a flood.  Rich clover, succulent spinach, geranium and a wonderful variety of indigenous grasses and bushes grow in profusion.

This has been a marvellous season for the east and there is an abundance of cotton, salt and blue bushes, barley, silver, canary, prairie and spear grasses.  The sheep have become choosey, being able to pick the choicest morsels.  We drove through 6,000 acres of black spear grass 3 ft 6 inches high and yet in one drought year 3,000 lambing ewes were kept alive there on sandalwood that ‘all hands and the cook’ broke down for them.

The timber consists mainly of little mallee, myall, sandalwood, black oak and bullock bush, with magnificent stands of gums along the creek near the homestead.  Rank growth of the tobacco tree is a problem that has spread over the swamp.  Mr Pearse thinks that the seed must have washed down the creek in floods from the Burra area.

This year ‘The Gums’ will shear some 18,000 animals.  The shed has eight stands and is fitted with the Moffat-Virtue Sheep Shearing Machines, driven by a 4 b.h.p. petrol engine.  The Federal Sheep Shearing Company has the contract and they supply the shearers, overseer and book-keeper.  The wool classing is done by students from the School of Mines under a foreman from the same.

The station has also bred splendid horses, suitable for the remount service.  The name of T.H. Pearse & Son is well known in the half-yearly shows held in Adelaide by the royal Agricultural Society and at other shows.
