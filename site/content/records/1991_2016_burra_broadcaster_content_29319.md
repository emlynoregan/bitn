Questions to Council by the Burra Broadcaster

Was the sealing of the surface behind the Commercial Hotel part of normal work?  It was undertaken to overcome drainage and road maintenance issues.

Was the office upgrade really needed?  Were there viable alternatives?  The upgrade was needed.  Alternative sites in Burra were considered and Council looked at separating the office and the meeting room.  Occupational health and safety issues and public access concerns led to the decision to remain in Market Square.

What is happening with Paxton Square?  Interim managers have an extension of their contract to June 2003.  In the meantime management has been working on upgrading the Kingston Street Row.  A decision on the future management structure has been deferred.

The Melbourne Cup Luncheon organised by the Burra Hospital Auxiliary is noted with a photograph of five who attended.

O’Connor’s Shed [Drew & Crewe’s Bulk Store] at Burra North.
