The Mayor wired the Government deploring the loss of Lord Kitchener and received a wire thanking him for the feelings of Burra and District that were expressed.  [Kitchener was the British War Minister and he was sailing to Russia on HMS Hampshire when it struck a mine off the northern island of the Orkneys on 5 June 1916 and sank with only 12 survivors.]
