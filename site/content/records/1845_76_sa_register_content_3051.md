The Superintendent’s duties were to oversee and give direction to all underground excavations and surface work, including cleaning and dressing of the ore.

First Captain was Henry Roach, appointed January 1847.

Second Captain Bryant

Third Captain Goldsworthy

Fourth Captain Penglaze [print here is faulty, but the name when he gives evidence is Samuel Penglaze.]

Penglaze is the surface [or elsewhere the grass] captain.  His duty was to attend to ore dressing.

Written instructions dated 8 September 1847 were given to Burr on 15 September 1847.

Burr sent about 102 letters to the Secretary/Directors during his term, together with some thousands of documents, including the Superintendent’s Report.  Ayers swore that this latter was not in the form of a journal.  He could not say whether everything of importance was enumerated.  Witness assented to a long list of returns as being Burr’s duties.  After Burr had left, they had found no copies of the correspondence.  An incomplete diary had been found.  At first letters were transmitted weekly, but later as postal arrangements changed, they were sent twice weekly.

Questioning then turned to the cottages.

Ayers said he had not seen the cottages from 10 August until after Burr’s dismissal.  (A contract was presented for the erection of the 40 cottages, the subject of complaint.  It was in Burr’s handwriting and dated 5 April 1848.)

The cottages were to cost £45 each.  Some were unfinished when Burr was dismissed and had been continued by the same contractor, who had been paid about £200.  Some stone cottages had been built before that of 3-4 rooms each, at a cost of c. £150 each.  They had been erected under the supervision of a distinguished architect.  [Kingston]

The smelting house in stone and brick had cost £1,500.

Ayers admitted that these cottages ‘were all cracks’ as was the smelting house, though ‘not more cracks than in other buildings in town’.

Fisher was queried as to relevance and said he intended to show these cracked buildings were erected under the supervision of one of the complaining parties.

Ayers said the census had show there were c. 1,500 living at the Mine – a number of them ‘in holes excavated’.

Fisher said on 7 September Ayers had written to Burr and said in part:

‘It was satisfactory to know that Mr Elphick’s analysis corresponded with your own, and that Dr Bruhn cannot be relied on.’  The letter of Burr’s dismissal was dated 8 September!

[Evidence was then given relating to ores raised before Burr’s arrival.]

Ayers went on to give evidence concerning assays and said that when the Directors decided that samples should be sent to Adelaide for assay, because they had no confidence in Mr Hoskins or Mr Burr, they had not communicated that fact to Mr Burr.  Mr Kingston had pointed out the defects in the cottages and suggested possible improvements.  The suggestions were complied with.  Among suggestions, walls were to be made 18 inches higher and doorways 6 inches higher.

[There was a long cross-examination of the correspondence between Burr and Ayers in which Fisher sought to show that Burr had taken action regarding the cottages and to increase the efficiency of the Mine.]

The sitting was adjourned.

Samuel Penglaze, Grass Captain gave evidence that the assay office adjoined the general office.  He never saw Mt Burr assay any ore.  He saw Mr Hoskins assaying every day.

Mr Gwynne submitted that devolving the duty to his drudge was neglecting it.

Witness Penglaze never saw assaying done after Hoskins left.  Mr Burra was present in the works.

[Further evidence was given concerning operations and Burr’s presence at them.]

W.H. Challoner, Mine accountant, explained the recording of the ore raised etc.  He recognised the plaintiff’s diary when handed it.  He had seen Mr Burra assaying a few weeks before he left the mine – though not earlier.

He knew some cottages were built by Taylor and were in some measure without foundations.  Floors were beneath the outer surface.

Henry Roach, Mine Captain, said he took the samples for assay.  He had seen Burr assay by wet process, but not by fire, shortly before he left.

He recalled the Directors’ visit in June, when Hoskins was dismissed and heard Burr say he would back him (Hoskins) against any man in the colony for assaying.

[Further evidence was given relating to the 6,550 tons of ore on the dressing floor and of other details of operations at the mine.]

J.E. Phillips, clerk at the SA Mining Association Office gave some evidence.

James Trewartha, Government Mineral Surveyor, gave evidence of how ore samples were taken.

Edward Davy, Surgeon, gave further evidence of assaying and sampling.

Andrew Robins, miner at Burra Burra, gave evidence of hearing of the new rules on how assays would be conducted and used.  He also lived in one of Taylor’s cottages, paid 3/- a week for it and had no cause for complaints regarding it.

John Hailes, miner at the Bon Accord, had worked at the Burra Burra Mine for two years and gave evidence on sampling processes.

Richard James, miner, living in the Creek at Burra Burra, gave further evidence on sampling techniques.

The case was then adjourned.
