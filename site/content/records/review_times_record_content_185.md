Proposed listing on the National Estate from Burra

Miners Dugouts

Old Kooringa Post Office

Paxton Square

Princess Royal

Redruth Bridge

Redruth Gaol

St Joseph’s Roman Catholic Church

Brewery Cellars

St Mary’s Anglican Church

Burra School

All buildings in the Burra Burra Mine area: Powder Magazine, unnamed draft engine house, Welsh Chimney, Cornish Chimney, relocated Peacock’s Chimney & Storeman’s Residence.

Drawings are printed of Redruth Gaol, St Mary’s Anglican Church, Old Kooringa Post Office [though this is wrongly labelled as the Town Hall] and Burra Railway Station [though this is not named in the printed list: which admittedly says they are ‘among the proposed buildings…’]
