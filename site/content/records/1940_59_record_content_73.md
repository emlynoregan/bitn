The Buffalo Lodge gave a Christmas Tree & Festival on 20 December at the Institute.  T.H. Woollacott, as Mayor, opened the proceedings.  Guests were welcomed by Past Primo C.S. Preiss and received by the Sitting Primo, Bro. E.T. Baulderstone.

The mayor spoke of the true meaning of Christmas and hoped the present conflict would be wiped away by Christmas 1940.  He also praised the patriotic efforts of the Buffalo Lodge here and in England.  Mr Allen Lomman was Father Christmas and distributed gifts to children present, after which came ice creams and supper.

Red Cross has sent away three parcels of goods in the last three months.

Burra High School break-up on 19 December is reported.  It was held in the schoolâ€™s large assembly room.  A concert preceded the presentation of prizes by Dr Steele.
