N. Hiles Pearse writes a letter as President and Chairman of the Burra racing Club pointing out that townsmen failed to support the recent Burra Races.  Why, he asks, were 98% of the people at the meeting from out of town?  It was so noticeable that the sporting fraternity now jokes that the Burra Racing Club was a meeting for visitors.  Even allowing for ‘conscientious objectors’ and those without funds it was poor.  A leading townsman has said: ‘Surely you know there are more ‘wowsers’ to the square foot in Burra than in any other town in the world?’

The annual race meeting brings in a lot of outside money so why is the club completely ignored by the tradespeople of Burra?  We only ask for a square deal, or the time may come when the ‘Men on the Land’ who support the town [and run the race meetings] may withdraw their sympathy and support for the town.
