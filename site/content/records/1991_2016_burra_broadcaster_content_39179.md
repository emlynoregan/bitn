Burra Tennis Awards 2014

Club Person of the Year was a tie between Leanne Stockman and Anthea Lines.

The Andrew Tiver Award went to Travis Thamm (Male) and Leanne Stockman (female).

John Arthur was awarded Life Membership for his active involvement with the club since 1988, as a player and coach.  He introduced night tennis and was instrumental in having tennis and netball courts added to the town oval and has also been a keen fundraiser.

A plaque was recently unveiled in honour and recognition of the late Leo Robinson, on the court where he loved playing.  It has been named ‘Leo’s Court’.  [Photo.]
