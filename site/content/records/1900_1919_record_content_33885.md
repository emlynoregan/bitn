The Record Photographic Studio is to be reopened by a photographer with excellent credentials.  Though practically under the same roof, the studio will not be connected with the business of The Record.  [Though it is not stated, presumably the studio ceased to operate when Mr Davey sold the paper, as he was the photographer.]
