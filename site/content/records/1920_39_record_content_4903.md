Violet Day Services.

Last Sunday a united memorial service was held in the Burra Institute.  The day was very wet and cold, but a large number of residents attended.  The Mayor presided with Rev. H.H. Hopton, Rev. G.K. Haslam and Captain Bland and Lieut. Thomas of the Salvation Army.  Speeches by the Mayor, Rev. Hopton & Capt. Bland are reported.  Rev. E.M. Ingamells and W.G. Hawkes sent apologies.  There was a collection in aid of the Fallen Soldiersâ€™ Memorial.

Violet Day services were also held at the Kooringa Methodist Church, the Ironmine Methodist Church in the afternoon and the Redruth Methodist Church in the evening.
