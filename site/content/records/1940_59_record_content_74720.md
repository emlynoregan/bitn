Burra Racing Club was looking forward to a record meeting with the track in perfect order, but 30 points of rain during the day spoilt this.  Between noon and 1 p.m. there were very heavy showers and a deal of hail.  A crowd was present and the gate was Â£218.  The CWA ladies did wonderfully for lunch, but the demand was so great that they were practically cleared out by 2 p.m.  [Results printed.]
