Letter.  Avian Pink writes on behalf of Mrs Stella Lihou seeking information about a 19th century ginger beer and cordial factory in Queen Street.  It was opened in 1876 by Thomas Jones Monro, with Stephen Lihou as manager.  Miss Stella Lihou is writing the family history and is seeking any information about the location of the factory â€“ perhaps from land titles in Queen Street.
