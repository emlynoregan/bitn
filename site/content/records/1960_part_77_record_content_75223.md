E.C. Allen MP Member for Frome objects to plans to close all polling booths with under 50 voters average in the last three elections.  Places affected around Burra would be Black Springs av. 46.  [Though how 54, 48 & 51 averages 46 is not explained!]  Also Bright (41), Hanson (40) and Willalo (50).  His complaint is not so much about closures in the settled areas as the effect in more remote locations.  The result would be only one booth in the whole area north-east of Peterborough; at Yunta.  In the far north, if Oodnadatta closed (50) the nearest booth would be Marree 274 miles away.  With mail deliveries once a fortnight postal votes are also not an option in such remote areas.  The system would have to be changed.
