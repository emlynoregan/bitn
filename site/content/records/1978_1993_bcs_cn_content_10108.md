Land Sale

Recently the Burra Burra DC became aware that the land belonging to the late Mr Ted Kotz was for sale.  Over recent years the National Trust and the Department of Environment and Planning (Heritage Conservation Branch) have advised the Council that it should acquire this particular part of the creek area because of its heritage significance i.e. the archaeological sites of dugouts.

The land is offered in three lots:

The creek area

Vacant land

Kotz’s house and outbuildings.

Public Parks Advisory Committee was approached and advised it would be willing to subsidise purchase of the creek area as a park and the Department of Environment and Planning has verbally indicated a willingness to contribute to the cost of that area.

Subsequently the Council purchased all three lots.

It now has to decide what to do with lots 2 & 3 – whether to keep them for the people of Burra or to develop them as the people direct.  The Burra District Advisory Committee and other bodies have been approached and the National Trust has appraised the house and outbuildings, which have been made secure.
