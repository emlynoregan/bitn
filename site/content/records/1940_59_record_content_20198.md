Mr J.D. Kelly, (‘Duncan’) who was born at Copperhouse and has lived at Ulooloo for many years, was pleased to get a Christmas card from an old pal from his sporting days – Albert Bagg, who now runs a garage in Detroit, Canada.  Albert Bagg is a cousin of the Bagg Bros. of Burra and was born at Springbank, near Burra.  Mr Bagg’s speciality was bike riding and Mr Kelly’s forte was in the pedestrian events.  Albert Bagg set the first record for a bike ride between Broken Hill and Adelaide.  He was paced by a pair on a tandem following the rough Pegline track through King’s Well Station and Burra.  Mr Kelly once won a bicycle race, a hurdle race and the Sheffield, all in the one day.  He is now 72.
