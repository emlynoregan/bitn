Wilcannia & Points North, Part 2

The journey continued north from Reg. Nevan’s ‘Ulaili’, 43 miles north of Wilcannia, on the Paroo.  The station of 60,000 acres was then half under water.  Ducks proves elusive, though they could be heard in the canegrass.  A few brolgas were around.  Floodwaters forced the group to backtrack to Wilcannia for an approach to Wongalilli via White Cliffs.
