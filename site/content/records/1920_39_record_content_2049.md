Football.  A meeting of the Aberdeen Football Club was held in C. & A. Fuss’s shop on 13 September to discuss the Farrell’s Flat protest and its consequences.  Charles Fuss took the chair.  Mr Willshire reported on the legal opinion obtained and the Associations meeting attended.  After rehearsing the whole matter (reported in ¾ column) it was decided to move that the Association join the SA League and that that body then be asked to give their opinion on the dispute.  Whether Aberdeen joins the Burra Association in future was left to the next meeting.
