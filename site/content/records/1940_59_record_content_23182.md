Cr Bevan said an Adelaide firm was offering a 15 Watt Public Address System that had been used for demonstration purposes, for £55 as against £79 for a new machine.

Cr Jennison said such an amplifier would be too large if it was to be used only in the hall.

It was decided to let the matter lie on the table for future reference.
