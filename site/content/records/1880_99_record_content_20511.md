E. Gray writes as a teamster plying between Terowie and Burra and Silverton.  He complains that price-cutting between the merchants of Terowie and Burra is ruinous for the teamsters.  He urges all carters to demand Â£7 a ton to Silverton, which after all is only wages when the wear and tear and horse feed is allowed for.
