Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co.  Work continues, but without any spectacular results.  The main effort is in the shaft near Peacock’s Air Shaft and the surrounding area looks like a mine in miniature with winding ropes, horse path, stampers, washers, ore heaps, windlass, buckets and sorting house.  The shaft near St Mary’s has again been abandoned.  On the old ore beds are five heaps of ore from tributers – some not doing very well – there being too much dead work.
