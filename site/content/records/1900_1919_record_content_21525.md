‘Straight deal’ writes calling for a co-operative bakery in Burra because the bakers have increased bread prices to 3d from 2½d – it having only recently been decreased to 2½d by all but two of their colleagues.  He believes it rose again because the two dearer bakers suffered little loss of trade.
