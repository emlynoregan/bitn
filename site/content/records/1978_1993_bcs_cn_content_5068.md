title: Enquiries have been made to determine where all this copper is coming from.  The
  smelting works was in an adjacent paddock and much slag is scattered all over the
  locality and samples are often found in the Gully and Faraway Paddocks.  Also many
  paths in the area are made with mine tailings, which also contain small amounts
  of copper.  Testing is continuing and until these results are in we will not know
  which paddocks are a problem and which, if any, are safe.  Hopefully we will be
  able to devise some remedial strategy.
