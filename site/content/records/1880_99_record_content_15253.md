Burra Town Council

The new arrangements for the water supply will see the meters charged to the capital account and there be no direst charge to consumers for them.  Instead users will agree to guarantee to take water for three years as follows:

½” service, £1-5-0 worth.

¾” service, £2-10-0 worth.

1” service £5 worth.

Editorial on the SAR Enquiry and also the one in Queensland.

2nd Leader on the Burra Waterworks.

The water will begin to flow on Friday 21 November for all who have connections to the main.  [This is a characteristically flowery paean of praise is unusual only in its adding of Persian to the languages dropped in to impress the reader: ‘this necessary element, this àb-i-hàiàt’.]

Oddfellows & Foresters’ Picnic Sports ended up with a balance in hand of between £5 and £6.
