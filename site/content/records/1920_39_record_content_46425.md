Frank Treloar: Looking Back (Continued)

Outstanding claims were then settled including a second £10 to Thomas Pickett for pointing out the northern lode.  Of the 85 scrip certificates to be sold to original holders, 60 had been disposed of and 24 were on hand.  Mr Finke applied for permission to buy 8 at £5 each and this was accepted.  The remaining 16 it was decided would be offered to the scrip-holders at the next half-yearly meeting, by public auction.  This cleared the way for work to start at the mine and among the first applicants was John Snell, who would spend the rest of his life in Burra.  Mr Mildred advised he had spoken to some German miners and smelters recently arrived and he had advised them to apply for work.  Messrs Stocks and Penny were to follow this up.

On 23 September the directors met and Mr Beck was appointed Chairman of Directors and Messrs Graham, Peacock & Neales were appointed a committee to employ men for one month to raise as much ore as possible from the North Lode and to procure tools and supplies.  Tenders for the conveyance of ore were to be placed immediately – no tender to be for less than two tons.

At the directors’ meeting 30 September 1845 it was reported that Thomas Roberts had been engaged to take charge of the mine for one month at the usual Captain’s wages of £3 a week and also two miners and a mining smith for 35/- a week each – with them to find their own rations.  The directors entered into an agreement with Mr Hack for the cartage of tools, stores etc to the mine, then to remain for two loads of ore of about two tons each and to return with the same for £16.  Since then eight bullock drays had been despatched with an agreement to pay at the rate of £3 per ton.

On 2 September 1845 the assayers Dr Davey & Mr Elphick assayed the first ore samples at 63½% pure copper from a green, red and horse flesh and yellow sample.  From the green portion of samples they got about 50% copper and from the red portion 77% copper.  The dull red portion (gossoon) is mainly oxide of iron impregnated with copper.

The estimations were that if the ore in the surface block measured 40ft x 30ft and was say 3ft deep it would weigh 380 tons and would be worth between £30 and £40 per ton or £11,400 to £15,200.  An offer by William Cooke and Robert Depledge to cart ore to Pt Adelaide for £3 per ton was accepted.

On 14 October the directors decided to call the mine the Burra Burra Mine, meaning in the native language ‘Great Great’.  [The commonly accepted origin is from Hindi.  The local creek was so named from 1839, but there is an alternative view giving a Scottish origin for ‘fort’.]

On 29 October 1845 the land grant for 10,000 acres was received from the Registry Office and given to Messrs Smart & Baynes solicitors to prepare a trust deed.

On 4 November the Surveyor General had authority to survey the land between Adelaide and the Burra Creek.
