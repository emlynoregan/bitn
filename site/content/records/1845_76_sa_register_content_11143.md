Central Road Board

Messrs James Masters & Samuel Stocks delivered a memorial to the Board.  The memorial expressed their concern and surprise that the designated main road north from Gawler had been changed.  Previously it had gone to Templer’s, the Light Bridge, Forrester’s [Tarlee] Riverton, Saddleworth, Chinkford [Chingford – later Manoora] (late Monkton’s Station), Black Springs, Burra.  The new road is the less direct route to Sheoak Log, Kapunda, across Taylor’s Range to Forrester’s to Auburn.  The memorialists considered that a few hundred pound spent on places along the old road, where water stood after heavy rains, would save a huge sum needed for the less direct route now proposed.

Mr Blyth thought the whole question would depend upon the railway, as there was a general feeling that where a railway went there should not also be a main road.  As the railway was to be continued to Kapunda the main line of road would have to start from there.

The Chairman said the best road to Burra would then be by Tothill’s creek with the road to Clare via Forrester’s.
