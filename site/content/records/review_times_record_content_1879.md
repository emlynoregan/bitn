BCS.  Parents & Friends’ Association Annual Report by President Celine Stockman.

Ten general meetings and two executive meetings in the year enjoyed good support.  A major money raising effort for the year saw five large functions the Association catered for.  At the year’s end we have c. $660 in the bank after buying video equipment and tapes and new sports uniforms for senior students.  Thank go to the mothers who have helped in the canteen and with the reading program.
