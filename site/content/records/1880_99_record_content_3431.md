W.B. Rounsevell

Views unchanged since 1875 - a free trader.

For a mixture of income and property taxes and stamp duties.  Taxes should fall more heavily on the rich.

For federation.

Was for the development of railway traffic, but not for new lines until the present ones could be made profitable - though he believed the line to the N-E from Petersburg might be an exception worth considering.  [i.e. to Broken Hill]

Favoured 6 districts for the Legislative Council.

Was for action to reduce the rabbit menace.

Chinese immigration should be restricted.
