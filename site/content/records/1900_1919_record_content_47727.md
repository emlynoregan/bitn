The Australia Day Committee met on Thursday and the treasurer said there was c. £1,139 in hand with about £59 outstanding, some large amounts having been forwarded directly to Adelaide, but to be credited to the Burra Committee.  It was resolved to send £1,000 to the Central Committee.

Repatriation Fund.  There was a meeting in the Council Chamber last Thursday to consider starting a movement to help along the Australian Soldiers’ Repatriation Fund.

Mr Crewes said the Federal and State Governments would start the fund off with £500,000.  It would be entirely separate from the Wounded Soldiers’ Fund or any other and would be to enable returned soldiers to help themselves.  They would be advanced loans without interest to help establish themselves in a farm or business, or acquiring tools of trade etc.  He thought there should be country representatives on the Board to encourage country donations.   A major effort is planned for the 27 October.
