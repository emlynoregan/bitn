Father David Burgess was ordained as a priest and subsequently commissioned as Priest-in-charge of the Burra Parish last Saturday morning.  The clergy who attended included Bishop Garry Weatherill and Bishop Phillip Aspinall along with some 20 priests from this and other dioceses.  It is almost three years since Burra had a permanent resident priest.  In that time regular services have depended on the three Pastoral Assistants, Michael Burge, Geraldine Smedley and Mary Woollacott.  David completed training as a deacon at St Mary Magdalene’s Church in the city.  Rosemary Nairn came from Adelaide to play the organ and Burra Ecumenical Choir led the singing.  Garry Weatherill, who had been 6th Bishop of Willochra for just a week, gave the address.

John David Burgess is aged 35 and has previously worked as a registered nurse – most recently at Dawe House Hospice at the Repatriation General Hospital in Adelaide.  David and his wife Kate have been married for four years.  David’s son Zac is 12 and he is living in England this year with his mother who is on a work exchange.  David’s other interests include eating and drinking (in moderation), bushwalking, cycling, swimming and enjoying a wide variety of music.  Kate is 28 and has been one of the Ministry Development Officers in the Diocese of Adelaide.
