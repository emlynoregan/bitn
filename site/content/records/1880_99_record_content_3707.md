W.B. Rounsevell’s Meeting at the Institute, 2 April.

Believed in small Govt. and civil service retrenchment.

Taxation would be necessary if retrenchment was not severe.

Everyone should be taxed equally for the cost of his personal protection and then according to his means for anything else.

He favoured a property tax or a tax on income derived from it.

Would also support an income tax and stamp tax if they were aimed in all cases at those wealthy enough to pay.

Believed land law needed reform.  Interest three years in advance was unfair.  In the poorer areas 2,000 to 5,000 acres should be allowed and lands not worth £1/acre should be let on lease.  Too much was currently left to regulation.

Narrow gauge railways should become broad gauge.

Goods trains should go more slowly to save wear and tear on the line.  Here they travel at 30-35 m.p.h., while in England at 10-20 m.p.h.

He favoured a divided Legislative Council electorate - a colony-wide electorate was too large.

The Education Act was too dear.

Mr Ridgway also spoke briefly.
