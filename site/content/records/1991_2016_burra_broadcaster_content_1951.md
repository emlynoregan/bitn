Comments from the judges on Burra’s entries are printed.

Burra Senior Citizens’ Garden – the flood of early 1993 had almost reached the underside of the paving of the Kingston St Bridge and washed away much of the garden, especially the feature bed just south of the bridge.  The Council had replaced soil and the bed was replanted.  The garden occupies a strip about 150 m long and gives a pleasing foreground to Paxton Square cottages [as well as to the park south of the bridge.]

BCS – much of the comment here deals with various year level groups planting trees and undertaking recycling projects involving weeds and pruning, but also metals and plastics.  The school is praised for its efforts.

Shirley Broad’s Cottage Garden – is praised for its colour content and the constantly changing nature of its evolving composition.
