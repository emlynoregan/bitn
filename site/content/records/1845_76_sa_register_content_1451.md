Mr Smith said he did not speak personally [of Mr Graham] but of the principle.

The Chairman repeated that he would not receive any motion on the subject.  They may discuss the voting scale when the Deed of Settlement came before them.

Mr Smith thought that too late, of course.

The results of the voting were:

Paxton	1,764	Featherstone	639

Stocks	1,650	Johnson	488

Brown	1,348	Addison	424

Ellis	1,150	Neales	330

Allen	892

The Deed of Settlement was then produced and Mr Bayne began to read the massive document.  Soon after the start Mr Featherstone objected that he for one found it impossible to follow its complexities and objected to not having the leisure to peruse it.  Dr Addison and Captain Hall agreed it would take a week of leisure to become conversant with it.  Mr Stocks said that even a lawyer could not give an opinion of it from a hasty reading and he would not sign it without reading it.  It was agreed to have it printed and a committee was appointed to go over it, to receive objections etc. and to make recommendations to the Directors.  The meeting was adjourned to 19 May.
