The annual report showed 35 members including social members.  The open day on 20 June was held under ideal conditions and entries exceeded expectations.  The project for this season was to raise money for a change room and this was completed and ready for the Men’s Open Day.  Associates donated £100 towards this.  In Pennant matches with Clare and Blyth, Clare was victorious.  Club champions for the year:

‘A’ Grade	Miss E. Tiver
