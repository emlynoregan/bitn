Obituary.  George Trevelyan of Ashmore, formerly a railway packer was found drowned in his well.  It is thought he threw himself in while temporarily of unsound mind following influenza.  [Died 8 June.]

W.R. Ridgway conducted the inquest.

John Diplock, deceased’s brother-in-law said on the 8th he was having dinner with him when the deceased got up, said he had had enough, and walked out of the room.  Thought he was by the kitchen fire, but when we came out he was not to be seen.  His wife noticed the cover was off the well and I went down and found his hat.  Sent to Copperhouse for help and to the police.  When help came we got the body out of the well.  Deceased was 50.  Three sons and a brother were eating dinner with him and his wife.  The well is 80’ deep with about 12’ of water.  He had been ill, but had no known problems else.  His wife says he had been very depressed.

The jury found ‘there was no evidence to prove how he got there’.
