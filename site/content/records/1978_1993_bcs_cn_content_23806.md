Burra Community Sports Club Inc.

President Paul Wilson’s Annual Report 1992

The main event of the year was the demolition of the complex by fire early in the football and netball season 1991.  D.T. Jacka & Co. undertook the demolition and rebuilding using the majority of local sub-contractors.  By December 1991 the building was better than ever with new carpets, a new bar system, tables, chairs and a verandah along the back, with future plans for extensions and improvements.  The kitchen has been improved with a much larger and more efficient working space.  Further improvements await only a reply from a grant application.  The efforts of the Club and its committee were recognised by receiving the Australia Day Award for Community Event of the Year.  Cr Graham Kellock must be acknowledged for his tremendous work in liaising with the insurance company and the architect.  The Ladies’ Auxiliary deserves many thanks as well.  Richard Secomb raised money with our sheep project and Don Stockman cropped the Hanson Reserve on share and raised $400 for the club.
