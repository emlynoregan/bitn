The new Wool Pavilion displayed 116 fleeces.

Mr Brookman opened the show.  [His speech is reported.]

Mr Brookman also cut a large ribbon to open the new Wool Pavilion and was presented with a key donated by Mr R. Fuss, to serve as a memento of the occasion.

The Burra Rural Youth Club greatly aided the show; firstly by providing and arranging a display of rural products in the lower pavilion and secondly by providing stewards for most sections of the show.

The club also arranged the Sheep Judging Competition and at night ran a successful dance in the Main Hall, which added £38 to the Society’s funds.  During the year the club raises funds for the Show Society and assists in the maintenance of buildings etc.

[Results are printed on pages 1 & 4.

Personal interest.  R. Fuss donated the trophy for the greatest number of staged exhibits in the Flower Section.  He is also listed as one of the winners in the Flower Section – details of which are not printed.]
