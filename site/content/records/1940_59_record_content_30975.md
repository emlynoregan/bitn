Paxton Square.  When we recently published an article on the deplorable living conditions and the dangers of unhygienic living in Paxton Square we did not intend to suggest the residents be put on the streets.  We had thought that the residents would have supported us in an effort to improve their living conditions.  If anyone can get the Health Officer to say the article was incorrect and get him to say it is a healthy place to live and that living conditions there are adequate for these enlightened times we will take it all back.  In NSW recently we saw small modern frame houses containing all modern conveniences.  This is what the basic wage earner is entitled to.  Surely it is better for them to pay say 25/- a week for rent and principal and to own the house in 20 years than to pay 20/- a week for rent alone and have nothing to show for it.  A letter from J. Parkes to Council on Monday gave them the opportunity to discuss the matter, but Council was reluctant to discuss the matter at all.  Only the Mayor seemed willing and anxious to get better living conditions for people in Paxton Square.  The mayor said no one wanted to pull the square down, rather if decent dwellings could not be obtained for its residents then the square should be made more habitable.  One day a Councillor will demand a report from the Health Officer on the Square and it will not be good.  Then the fight will be on for better living conditions for the basic wage earner and above all for their kids.
