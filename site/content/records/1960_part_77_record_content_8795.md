The Royal Agricultural & Horticultural Society has agreed to return the old jinker for preservation on the mine property.  It was specially made in England to transport Morphett’s huge boiler and engine to the Burra Mine from Port Adelaide.  Forty bullocks were used under the direction of six bullock drivers.
