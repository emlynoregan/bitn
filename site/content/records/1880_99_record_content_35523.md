South Australia: A reprint of a letter on South Australia’ from the Church Reformer, (England) which the editor characterises as a libel on SA.  It was written by Charles L. Marson.

SA is not the place to send working men as it has rocks ahead:

Wages are high

Unions are powerful

Protection is rampant

Prices are high so workers are little better off with higher wages

Reckless farming is ruining the soil

The colony is loaded with debt

It is an interesting letter of how the colony impressed a visitor [Presumably a new Anglican churchman.)

The article provides some lovely quotes of which the following give just a taste.

‘Colonists have run up flimsy houses and untidy fences, and built pretentious, tasteless, and fraudulent chapels and town halls.  The roofs are of wrinkled zinc.’

‘The people are most kind and hospitable.  The old folk are healthy and free of carriage.  The young ones are pale, slight and undisciplined.’

‘Speculation in land and mines ousts all mental speculation.’

‘We have an established Church in Adelaide.  It is called the Totalizator.’

‘The principal products of SA are horsemen, larrikins, land agents, and silver rafflers.’
