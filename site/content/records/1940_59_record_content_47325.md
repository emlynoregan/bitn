Burra Town Council, 4 September

The Buffalo Lodge was given permission to use the Rotunda and part of Market Square for their Christmas Tree on 20 December.

Council approved the Housing Trust of SA’s plans for the new subdivision of the property bought by them in Queen St.

Burra Burra DC replied to a letter from the Town Council about the bituminising of Main Road 45, saying that since the main Broken Hill road will now run via Hanson and Harding’s Corner, they would prefer to have that expedited.  The Town Council voted to support that move.

V.J. Dower’s offer to lease a portion of the road between the Sandland Estate and W. Lee’s property for 15/- per annum was accepted.

A portion of Commercial St is to be roped off for the finish of the Adelaide-Burra Road race on 23 September.
