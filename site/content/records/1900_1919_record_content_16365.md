Paull’s Mine.  The new machinery has been erected.  It is expected that the first run will be made at the end of February.  Matt. May of smelts frame [sic: fame?] is on the job there, busy preparing cages, vanners etc. to deal with the ore that is said to be present in large quantity.  Charley Fuss, metaphorically speaking is the daddy of local shareholders and a perfect idol amongst them.  This is on account of his reliability and genuineness of purpose.  ‘It is as good as a first in Tatt’s for them that he is a director, and having a swooping command in the venture takes great interest in it and looks after its welfare O.K.’
