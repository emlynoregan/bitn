Burra Dramatic Club performed before a large audience at the Institute on Thursday in aid of St Mary’s Church and the Burra Brass Band played out front.  The review is quite lengthy and while not vicious is certainly quite critical, ending with ‘we have entered into more detail, and been more critical than we usually are with amateur entertainments because the Dramatic Club is a permanent institution, and nothing will help it like wholesome criticism.
