Burra Institute is now Burra Town Hall

After the signing of the conveyance at the Town Council Meeting on 2 July, the Council has taken over the running of the Burra Institute.

A letter from Mr Bednall, Council Solicitor, explained that the existing mortgage between the Institute Committee and the State Bank would be cancelled from 30 September next.  Pending this cancellation and transfer of the property the Council would pay the interest until 30 September at 4% on the amount owing of £3,161-15-9.  He had not received notification as to who was responsible for the collection and payment of moneys from 1 July.

Mr Riggs then presented the Deed of Conveyance that had already been signed by four of the trustees.  The necessary Council signatures and the Council Seal were duly affixed and witnessed.

Mr Riggs said he was glad that this had been achieved during the town’s Centenary Year.  He had been working for it for 20 years and had always thought the Institute should be the property of the ratepayers, whom he believed were truly getting their money’s worth.

[The paper does not report any official motion changing the name of the building, though it is stated in the headline and logically follows from the change in ownership.]
