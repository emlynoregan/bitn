Redruth Methodist Ladies Guild

Hon. Secretary Mrs Reta Jennison gave a résumé of the past year’s work at the recent Annual Meeting. Membership was 40 and 16 meetings averaged an attendance of 25. [She describes a year of many and varied activities, but also says it was ‘a very difficult year’ – though what follows that statement does not reveal the cause of the difficulties.  Details take c. 1¼ columns.]
