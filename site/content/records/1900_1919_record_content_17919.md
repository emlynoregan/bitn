Redruth Court, Friday

Three young men were charged on information of R.H. Finch with having entered his dwelling at ‘Tarkee’ near Burra and stealing two suits of clothes and other articles.  They were John Nash, Thomas Heffernan and George Bryant.

Mr R.H. Finch gave evidence of leaving the stolen items at the locked house and of returning to find the building had been broken into and the items stolen.  He identified the men as having been in the neighbourhood and identified the items produced.

Henry Finch gave evidence of a similar nature and valued the goods at £6.

Other evidence was given by John Thomas Neate, manager of Springbank Station, John O’Leary railway packer, who was missing an oilskin coat that had been seen with the accused and Murray Phelan clerk of Redruth.

M-C Phelan recalled the reporting of the offence and recounted the enquiries concerning the three men, the discovery of the missing items and the subsequent arrest at Hallett in the bedroom of a hotel.

M-C Clark gave evidence corroborating the above.  The accused were committed for trial.
