Burra Town Council

There was a complaint from Cr Sampson re crowds obstructing Market Square on Saturday nights.  [The unstated cause was clearly the Salvation Army]

Other councillors saw no problem and some thought the crowds on footways attending auctions were just as much a problem.  The matter was then dropped. [Cr Sampson was an auctioneer.]

Flagging.  Sara & Dunstan’s tender for flagging the footpath in Market Square was accepted at 1/3 per foot.

Cab Licences were issued to Alfred Schutz & A. Lines.

SAMA.  The Council Ranger moved that SAMA be asked for the deeds to the Recreation Ground.
