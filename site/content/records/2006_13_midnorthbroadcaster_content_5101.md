Arrangements based on the most recent leases and sales agency agreements remain in place until new arrangements are endorsed, except that the National Trust be released from maintenance obligations for Council owned sites for the period for which the Goyder Council has retained its share of the Passport income.

Chris Reed has recommended that a further general meeting be called as soon as possible to elect a member to the sub-committee.
