‘Have a Guess’ considers the town’s in a bit of a mess.  Having interfered in the price of milk question, there are now no deliveries.    Then there is Sunday Sport.  ‘Tommy’ wants to invoke unwritten law – ‘Lex non Scripta’, under which a man can slit his wife’s throat, or worse still, a woman can club her sleeping husband’. 

And who are these Hoodlums Stanley refers to?  The mayor seems a bit perplexed and Bauldie wanted to hide behind a smoke screen.  Only Bish put up a wall of logic against Tom’s time worn blusterings.

‘Perhaps we are a bit too wowserish…Above all let the churches keep out of this fight.  At time like these, they should sing “Peace, perfect peace” perhaps they could tune into “Fight the good fight” later when the mists have rolled away.’
