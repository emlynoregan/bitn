The Mayor said they had shut their eyes to play on Good Friday for the past 9 years.

Cr Dow said they had recently emphasised it in a letter.  He said the agreement must be stuck to until it is replaced.

The Mayor said to Cr Dow: You are not against playing on Sunday are you?

Cr Dow said: Certainly not, or Good Friday either.

The Mayor then said: It is open to you to move a resolution.

Cr Dow moved to scrap the requisite clause.

Cr Riggs said he believed the whole question was raised to introduce Sunday tennis and Councillors were not there to be dictated to by a few tennis players.

The Mayor wanted to see a successful carnival and if it came to his casting vote he would support deleting Good Friday from the agreement.

Cr Kellaway seconded Cr Dow’s motion.

Cr Bevan wanted to defer the matter; believing strings were being pulled that were undermining the Council’s dignity.
