Husband was a labourer living at Nelson Town.  At 8 a.m. on Tuesday he said he was going to have a yarn with Charlie and Sid Forder who were making a dam.  When my daughter came back from watering the cows at Firewood Creek I asked if she had seen her father and she said no.  Checked with Forder’s boys and they said they saw him about 10 a.m. and he had gone up the creek towards Hampton.  I could not find him and told his sister, Mrs Baker.  Noticed nothing peculiar in his manner and he never threatened to destroy himself.  Missed a little bottle marked poison, but the contents were insufficient to kill him.  He suffered from asthma and had money in the bank.
