Burra Town Council, 19 December

The cricket pitch at Victoria Park will be renovated at the cost of the St Mary’s Cricket Club using Council labour.

Other routine matters followed, but the main concern was the Waterworks.

Wilful waste of water is a problem with some consumers having their taps running continuously.  Unpaid rates amount to £157.  It was resolved to cut off water to consumers in arrears after 31 December.  The Government has not responded to the request re purchasing the Waterworks, except to say a valuation is being obtained and in the meantime a rate of 4% will be charged; the current lease conditions being continued.
