‘Once again Mr Robert Fuss has been a tower of strength to us with his work.  He saves us a considerable amount of money and is forever willing to keep things in order.  Through his efforts I can report the additions of a Casualty Room and a President’s Room.  Both proved an acquisition at the Show.  Mr Fuss was also instrumental in bringing the staging positions in the main pavilion up to date.  This caused a much better display of exhibits.  He also did numerous other jobs to benefit the Society, including the watering of trees which were presented by Mrs Stanley Hawker in front of the main buildings.  We are proud to have Mr Fuss as a Life Member.’
