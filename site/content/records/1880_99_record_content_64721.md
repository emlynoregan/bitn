Gradually, from a very shaky beginning attendances in this revival rose to 500 and some 250 conversions took place.  A new church was needed and the present noble structure was erected in 1859 at a cost of £2,217.  Mrs Way and Mrs Bastion walked hundreds of miles and gathered hundreds of pounds.  Altogether £614 was raised, leaving a debt of £1,603.  At its opening the young Samuel James Way, now Chief Justice and Lieut. Governor of SA, made his first public speech and presented a report subsequently published in the English Bible Christian Magazine.  The seat rent was £130 the first year, £80 the second, £92 the third, £78 the fourth to total £380.  Most of the money was borrowed at 10% and £166 was paid in one year.  Within four years the debt was reduced by £411 and in the next two by £202.  Within ten years the debt was down to £740, though by then over £800 had been paid in interest.  By 1869 there had been many removals, especially to Moonta and Wallaroo and in 1869 seat rents fell to £35 and by 1878 to £17.  They rose again in 1881 to £21.  Debts continued to fall until by 1884 it was £480 and it now stands at £140.  One way and another some £20,000 has been raised in Burra in the last 48 years.
