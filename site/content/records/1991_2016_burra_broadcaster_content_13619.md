Goyder Council

MFS-CFS.  It was resolved that all matters relating to the transfer of fire responsibilities in Burra township be deferred until the Minister’s report is received – provided that is by the October meeting.

The proposal to increase the sealed roads construction budget by $100,000 to $175,000 to allow for the sealing of the Mintaro-Farrell Flat Road failed at the vote.
