Burra Doctors Missing

Dr Dharma Dissanayake & her husband Dr Lakman Fernando went to Sri Lanka for a holiday three weeks ago and were due back on 21 June.  They have not been heard from since they left their hotel en route for the airport to fly home more than two weeks ago.  Family and colleagues’ concerns have been heightened by an unconfirmed report that Dr Fernando has been hospitalised in a medical centre on Colombo.  The lack of communication is uncharacteristic, as business associate and friend Lorna Robb of Melbourne said she usually heard from them daily.  The couple have been declared missing persons by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs.  The other problem created by their disappearance is that any locum coming to the Burra practice would not have authorisation to access patient files.  Ms Robb, as the couple’s emergency contact person and their accountant Bruno Batistella have been working on this problem as well as trying to establish the whereabouts and situation of the doctors.  Because the Burra practice is privately owned Country health SA has no authorisation to step in.
