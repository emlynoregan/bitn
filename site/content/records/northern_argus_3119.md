Burra Yacht Club Regatta will be held on Sunday 11 October.  There will be yacht races every hour with dragon boat races between other events.  Dragon boats with crews of nine raced for the first time last year.  The club will again sell their souvenir beer glasses, using their usual logo, as they have done every year since 1980.  The day’s racing will be followed by a cabaret in the Town Hall at 8 p.m. at which Dick Frankel’s Jazz Band will play.
