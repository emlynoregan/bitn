Lindsay Auld (13) late of Mt Bryan, and a friend, recently made a cannon and experimented with gunpowder.  The cannon was made of 3‚ÅÑ2 inch copper tubing sealed at one end.  They loaded the cannon and lit the fuse, which failed to ignite the gunpowder, but as Lindsay picked it up, it blew up, breaking his arm and cutting his face.  He is recovering.
