Burra RSL held its AGM last Saturday and about 60 attended.  Elected: President, E.R. Davey; Vice-Presidents, A.L. Bence & John Dighton; Secretary, Clem Davey & Treasurer, Ian Richardson.

The President M.G. Dobson reported a successful year socially and financially.  The Anzac Sports were a success largely due to sidelines run in conjunction with the sports.  The Diggersâ€™ Ball was a huge success.  The visit to the Berri Sub-Branch was also successful as was the annual Re-Union Dinner.
