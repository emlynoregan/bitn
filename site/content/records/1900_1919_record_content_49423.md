Railway Accident.  The Broken Hill train collided with a goods train at Stockport last Friday evening.  As at Burra 13 months ago it was turned onto the wrong line.  The only Burra passenger hurt was Kenny Gebhardt, son of Fred Gebhardt, who sustained slight facial injuries.  (There were some more serious injuries to other passengers.)
