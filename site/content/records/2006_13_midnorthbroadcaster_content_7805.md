The paper also reports the Burra Record’s article from 4 November 1958 on the Centenary of the National Bank and the 99th anniversary of its establishment in Burra.  The Advertiser of 6 May 1859 page 3 reported that the opening of the National Bank in Burra had been a great success and had improved the circulation of money in Burra.  Cash had replaced the money orders from the mine and the smelting works.  It was reported that nearly all the principal tradespersons had transferred their accounts and savings to the bank.  The affability of the manager has also tended to the success of the ‘Little Bank’.
