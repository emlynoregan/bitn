Fire.  On 16 December a large grass fire occurred on Canowie and wind carried the flames towards the homestead.  By noon 300 men were engaged.  The fire brigadeâ€™s pumps were blocked by debris from the impure water supply.  After it had travelled some 4 miles a wind shift enabled men to drive it towards the three-chain road and save the homestead.  A whirlwind spread it to another paddock though, and it got away again with a gale behind it.  It was heading to a small wheat crop of C. Collins, but determined action saved it.  A second lot of back burning finally succeeded in holding this outbreak by 7 p.m.  The cause of the outbreak is unknown, but possible a spark from a farmhouse fire near its origin.
