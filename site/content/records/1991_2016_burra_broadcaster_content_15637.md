Burra Golf Club.  Work on the western side of the Burra Golf Course is progressing with thousands of tonnes of soil already moved.  A large holding dam is being built to hold water from a creek running through the course.  It will be both a beautification feature and a source of water for irrigation.  The whole of the western side of the course will be closed while re-development goes on and as soon as the 1998 season is over, work will begin on the eastern side.
