Weather.  Rain at any other time would have been welcome, but as it marred the Easter Holidays it was received with mixed feelings.  Friday brought high winds and dust before rain set in on Saturday with a severe thunderstorm at about 2 a.m. that lasted an hour.  Heavy rain and hail fell at 9 a.m. and 49 points were recorded.  Showers continued through to Monday and by Tuesday morning the total of the falls had reached 160 points.  Only light falls were recorded to the east.
