Credit Union

Burra has held meeting to foster the idea of a local Credit Union following the closure of banks across country SA.  Public meetings were held in August at Burra and Eudunda and appointed a working party to report on the feasibility of establishing a local Credit Union.  The working party is currently trying all avenues to obtain a locally owned service to ensure a broader service into the future.
