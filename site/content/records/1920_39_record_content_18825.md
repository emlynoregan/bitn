Obituary.  Mrs William J. [Jones] Thomas died at Aberdeen.  She was the daughter of the late John & July Thomas who left Cornwall in the William Money.  She was born at sea in the Bay of Biscay 4 October 1848.  The family came directly to ‘Three Trees’, still in the possession of the youngest son of John Thomas.  In her 18th year she married W.J.

In 1918 they retired to Aberdeen and in January this year celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary.  Mrs Thomas was a great supporter of the Methodist Church.  She is survived by a husband, one daughter and three sons: Miss M.A. Thomas, W.J. Thomas Jnr (Aberdeen), Joseph Thomas (Willalo) & Edlie Thomas (Mt Bryan).  There are eight grandchildren.
