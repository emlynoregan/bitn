Barkers of Baldina Cottage Homes

Under the terms of the will of the late Mr J.R. Barker $70,000 was set aside for the purpose of erecting cottage homes for the aged on land adjoining the Burra Hospital.  Before the work could begin the Barkers of Baldina Cottage Homes had to become an incorporated body, completely separate from the Hospital.  This has now been done.  Plans have been drawn up and as soon as finance comes to hand an immediate start can be made.
