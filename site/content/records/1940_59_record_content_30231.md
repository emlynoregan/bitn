The Square needs to be thoroughly inspected by the Health Officer and the Inspector and if the allegations are proven the buildings should be condemned or at the very least any oders realating to it must be carried out.

On the other hand, where are the residents now there going to be housed?  The Housing Trust is building small comfortable homes elsewhere in SA, so surely the Council can bring pressure to bear to make the Housing Trust erect homes in the town for those in dire need of accommodation.

The biggest difficulty would be for the aged pensioners, who live there with rents that are comparatively cheap.  Before the war there was a move to build an Old Folks’ Home in Burra, but would it be a success now?  We fear that getting the staff to care for the residents would be a barrier.  The job would be monotonous; unvarying year after year.  At present we understand their presence is quite a problem at the Burra Hospital, but it is a problem that must be solved, because the elderly deserve every care and attention.

In our opinion the Local Board of Health can expect little backing from the Central Board in condemning the Square – they will be on their own.  Some years ago the Secretary of the Central Board inspected the place and said ‘it was up to the Local Board to make its own decisions’.
