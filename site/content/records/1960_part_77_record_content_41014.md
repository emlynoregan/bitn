Burra Bowling Club.  The President C. Leslie Phillips’ report on 1967-68.

[He reported on a falling off of interest in Pennant Bowls in the latter part of the year because the result was decided on the number of wins and percentage rather than on semi-finals and finals.  He thought the latter a better option.]

Last year there were 54 members – up 4 on the previous season.  During the year death claimed Guy Dollman, Horton Jennison, Jack Lockett, Roy Earle and Lindsay Hood.  Harold Crump had moved to Adelaide.

The Club Champion for the season was Bill Corner.

[The President’s discussion on a range of issues affecting bowls generally and the club in particular is printed in about 1¾ columns.]
