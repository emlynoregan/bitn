Letter from an angry ratepayer who attacks the court case reported in the previous issue when W.R. Ridgway had the rateable value of his property reduced.  He claimed the house concerned was worth only £8-15-0 a year which the writer said was clearly nonsense for a new eight-roomed house on the main street.  When W. West, agent for SAMA, says it is only worth £7 and he has known the property for over thirty years it is worse than nonsense: the house was not built more than 10-12 years, if so long.
