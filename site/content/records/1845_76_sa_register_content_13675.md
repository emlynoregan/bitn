Advertisement.  For Sale, the Caroona Mine, located about 30 miles north of the Burra, on a section leased from the Government for 14 years, the full years’ rent of which has been paid up.  About £300 has been expended on the property.  There is abundant wood on the property and water at one mile.  Our operations are principally confined to sinking on three lodes.  One shaft is down 10 fathoms on the course of lode, which contains a most promising lode from 1½ to 4 ft wide.  The lode is a beautiful gozzan, iron and very rich stones of copper ore of various kinds.  There is another lode of a similar nature to the west going down nearly perpendicular.  There are several other lodes on which we have done but little.  The present proprietors feel quite confident in recommending the property.  It has been inspected by several experienced men, who all agree that a moderate amount of money laid out under experienced men would make the mine payable in a short time.

Robert Hotchin, Burra.
