Burra Hospital can now provide transport for the frail and transport disadvantaged thanks to the Mid-North Community Passenger Network (MNCPN).  The service covers the council areas of Goyder, Clare, Gilbert Valley, Wakefield and Mallala â€“ 12,282 square km.  It is sponsored by the four councils and funded by the Passenger Transport Division and Home and Community Care, through Government grants.  There are cars based at Clare, Eudunda and Balaklava Hospitals.  Five volunteer drivers are accredited in the Burra area.  The MNCPN also has a nine-seater bus with wheel-chair lift that travels to Adelaide four days a week.  On Thursdays it is used for an intra and inter-town service between Clare, Burra and Riverton.
