Burra Town Council, 7 November

Members are invited to the opening of the new rooms at the High School on 8 November.

The Attorney General advises that money collected for the swimming pool cannot lawfully be directed to any other purpose.

The Editor expresses concern that the District Councils will close down from 23 December to 16 January at the height of the bushfire season.  DC employees and trucks etc. are stationed at various parts of the district and their quick action has saved much stock and property.  Who, apart from such employees, know how to handle the trailer pumps, start the trucks quickly, or where the equipment is kept?
