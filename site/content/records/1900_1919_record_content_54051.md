Nurse Mosey’s application for leave was dealt with properly.

The hospital has always been available for patients.

There are at least 35 beds available.

The Board has no reason to doubt the evidence of Nurse Fuss that she received no orders for preparations to be made for an operation on a patient named Rogers.

[Nurse Fuss was B.M. Fuss.]

General Conclusions

The Hospital Board and nursing staff have done their duty under difficult circumstances: ‘had it not been for certain actions of Dr Ashton, the circumstances which necessitated the holding of this enquiry could not have arisen.

The trouble has originated and came to a crisis in connection with.

admission of patients

attendance of Medical Officers at Board Meetings

the Board’s desire, conveyed to Dr Ashton re giving orders

hours of Medical Officers’ visits

arrangements regarding operations

The hospital was established as a public hospital for the purpose of

treating the sick poor

emergency cases

cases which for special reasons needed hospital treatment

Sources of income are:

Government Subsidy

voluntary contributions

payments made by patients for maintenance and treatment

Over time all sorts of people were admitted irrespective of social and financial circumstances on the medical practitioners’ orders – Members of Friendly Societies, persons with infectious diseases and well-to-do patients were admitted irrespective of provisions that existed for treatment and expense of such patients under friendly society rules, provisions of the Health Act or individual financial ability.  ‘The view of the Medical Officers seems to have been that the hospital existed for the convenience of all sorts of sick people.’

These views led to abuses which became more complicated with the possibility of personal gain on the part of doctors.  For instance Dr Ashton was MO for certain friendly societies as well as MO at the hospital and drew pay in each capacity by sending to hospital patients to whom he was obliged to give medical attendance and medicines at their homes.  There is also evidence that poor patients in hospital, judged unable to pay, have still been charged for medical attendance by the MO.

About 5 years ago the Board believed Mos were admitting patients improperly and that if Mos admitted patients they were paid to attend at the patient’s home there was a way of transferring cost to the hospital.  On 12 December 1912 the Board passed a resolution regarding hospital admissions which worked for some months.  Had they found out the actual state of affairs and dealt with it this Board of Enquiry believes there would have been no further trouble.

Some Board members saw this as a want of confidence in the doctors and a personal slight on them and an attempt to lessen their powers.  Private matters and personal feelings may have obscured the real issue.

Misunderstandings followed re the Board’s aims and attitude and this seems to have influenced Dr Ashton in the way he carried out or refused to carry out his duties.  He refused to attend Board meetings, took exception to a request to place his instructions in writing, he fixed operations times that gave maximum disturbance to hospital routines and made visits commonly at meal times.  He was removed from office as MO, on the grounds that he disregarded the Board’s instructions, on 5 July 1917.

Recommendations

Hospital rules should be revised to:

bring them within the terms of the Act of Parliament

regulate the admission of patients

establish a proper routine of hours for ward visits, operations and other necessary matters

Admission of members of friendly societies and those with infectious diseases should be made only under arrangements with the societies and Local Boards of Health respectively.

Only persons unable to pay for attendance should be admitted free of charge – except for emergencies and accidents where the Board should consider each patient’s circumstances.

The duties and responsibilities of the Inspector-General of Hospitals need proper definition.

The Government should consider appointing a medical practitioner as Government MO at the hospital at a reasonable salary with the right of private practice.
