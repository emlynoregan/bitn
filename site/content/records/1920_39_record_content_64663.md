Obituary.  Henry G. Schuyler died at Burra Hospital 10 November aged 86.  He was an old colonist, having been born at Encounter Bay in 1856 and his grandfather built the first church there.  The family then moved to Melbourne and after leaving school Mr Schuyler was employed as a shipping clerk on the Melbourne wharves for a number of years.  After that he took up droving and then colt breaking in the Darling country and from then on spent his life on sheep stations.  He came to the Booborowie District where he worked for Dr Brown, who then owned the vast Booborowie Station, where Mr Schuyler was a colt breaker and in charge of the rabbiting party.  He then moved to the employ of the late Joseph Ford of Diproseâ€™s and then to that of Mr Henry Riggs on Murkaby Station.  He also worked for the late Thomas Warnes, father of I.J. Warnes, for Mr J.B. Klem and the late J.M. McBride.  Prior to his retirement he was employed by Messrs A.J. & P. A. McBride and for a number of years managed Braemar Station and later went to their Lincoln Park Station in the Far North.  While there he suffered a broken leg some twelve years ago which led him to retire to Aberdeen.  He remained active despite this injury and only last year shore a sheep while staying with his son at Mt Bryan.  Mrs Schuyler died five years ago and since then he lived with his children.  Of three sons and four daughters the following survive: George Schuyler (Koomooloo), Mrs Steinberg (Lincoln Park), Mr R. Schuyler (Mt Bryan) and Mrs P.J. Hammer (Aberdeen).  On Son, Frank Schuyler, was killed in the Great War.  The late Mrs George Gallagher was a daughter.  There are a number of grandchildren.
