Burra Burra Mine.  Report of the Government Geologist.

The bore entered a brecciated lode at 760’ which at 813’ contained copper pyrites with quartz and calcspar, continuing for several feet.  Bore now at 1004’.  [But note the statement below that it is at 1,400’.] The core now being raised is fragmentary indicating the presence of cavities and water forced down the bore does not return.  This shows the copper bearing lode mentioned in the last reports of the old mine at 600’ continues to 800’. 

The results of boring are most satisfactory proving the continuance downwards of copper bearing ground.  Data justifies placing Morphett’s Shaft in order and restarting mining operations from that point.

The chances of striking a rich portion of lode in a single bore are slight.  It is recommended that the existing bore, now at 1,400’ continue to 1,500’.  The second bore is recommended for the east side and as near the open cut as practicable to try for the continuation of the ore bearing body worked there.  I need a surface plan of the site before fixing a definite site.
