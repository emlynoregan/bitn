Letters to the Editor.

John Vivian who is in the service of SAMA writes complaining of how he was referred to in the last Cousin Jenny & Aunt Betty Column.

William Geake writes that the statements made by W.R. Ridgway about him in the last issue were not true and he would air the matter before the ratepayers any time they liked. The editor hopes `the Ratepayers have something better to do than meddle in this affair.'
