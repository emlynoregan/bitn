Burra Town Council, 1 February.

Cr West asked the Mayor if his attention had been drawn to the inconsistent reports in the Gawler Bunyip, Kapunda Herald, Jamestown Review and the Burra Record, vilifying the actions of himself and the members of the Council, the same reports being but a tissue of lies and supposed to have been written by a member of this Council.

The Mayor said he had seen them and considered them a series of ‘gross misrepresentations tinctured with animus and calculated to bring this Council, also the municipality, into ridicule and disrepute’. 

The author should be severely censured for his breach of the 39th and 61st Standing Orders.

Cr Rabbich called for the suspension of standing orders to refer to writing in the provincial press by Cr Hardy.

Cr Hardy objected.

Cr Linkson 2nd the motion.

Cr Rabbich said Cr Hardy wrote that the new Council at their first meeting decided to call tenders for an engineer, which resolution was carried unanimously after each Councillor, as well as the Mayor, had expressed dissatisfaction with the engineer.

I say such assertions are a series of deliberate falsehoods.  I did not express dissatisfaction with the engineer.  I spoke to Cr Hardy who admitted that after writing he was doubtful as to whether I did speak against Mr Littlejohn.  If I voted for tenders and then voted for Mr Littlejohn it would have been inconsistency.

‘I . . . tell Councillor Hardy that what he had written was false, and the tissue of lies would not emanate from any gentleman.’

I move ‘that this Council hereby express its extreme dissatisfaction and dissapproval [sic] of the conduct of Councillor Hardy in reflecting on and misrepresenting the decision of this Council through the press and considers his action inimical to the best interests of the town and discourteous to his colleagues.’

Cr Watt supported the motion and also said he had not expressed dissatisfaction towards Mr Littlejohn.

Cr Hardy: ‘I say you did.’
