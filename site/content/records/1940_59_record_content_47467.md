St Mary’s.  At a service on 24 September at 3 p.m. a new pulpit was dedicated to the memory of Jane Barker, who was a regular attender and constant worker for the church.  The old pulpit came from St Andrew’s Walkerville and was made into its present shape in the time of Archdeacon Dove.  The painted panels were by Mr Halcom, who copied designs from Pugier’s Glossary of Ecclesiastical Ornament and designs of the Old Temple Church.  It will now go yo All Saints, Moonta.

The new pulpit honours Jane Barker, who was the daughter of William Young, who arrived in SA in the Hoogly in 1847 and who married Sarah Drew, who arrived in 1849.  Jane was born in 1855 in Hindley St, Adelaide in a house where Miller Anderson’s now stands.  She came to Burra at an early age and was confirmed here.  She lived in Burra until she married William Pitt barker in 1874 at St Clements, Enfield.  From then until 1919 she lived at Baldina when, aged 64, she moved to Adelaide.  Both she and her husband were regular attenders at St Mary’s in a time when transport was more difficult and they actively supported the church.  The pulpit is a worthy object to commemorate her life and service.
