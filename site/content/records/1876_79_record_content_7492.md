Dr Nesbitt, Mayor of Burra, waited on the Board re the approaches to main roads in Burra which the Board had thought were private approaches. He pointed out that they were public streets and the Council was entitled to payment which had been claimed. He felt the report last meeting which said the Board felt that the Corporation had tried to `get at' them was unfair. The Chairman said they would consider the matter and when visiting the town shortly would deal fairly with the Council.
