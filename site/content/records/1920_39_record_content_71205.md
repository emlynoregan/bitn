Burra Town Council.  Last meeting of the Council 6 June.

Sara & Co. were granted a licence for their weighbridge.

The new motor truck has been registered and H.J. Wilson has obtained a driver’s licence for the same.

Three small boys (who are known) have destroyed certain road signs creating damage estimated at £1-14-6.  The police are to be asked to interview the boys and parents with a view to reimbursement to save them from prosecution.

65 pines, 13 carobs and 25 kurrajongs have been ordered.

Council has agreed to do certain work on the schoolyard at cost price.

The need for a ratepayers’ meeting was discussed.

Cr Robinson was not anxious to have one, but it was OK if ratepayers wanted it.

Cr Dow felt similarly, but thought Ratepayers’ Meetings only made the Councillors targets for stupid jokes.

Cr Lott had no objections, but moved that such a meeting be deemed unnecessary.  Carried.

The depot building is to be used as a garage for the truck.
