Market Square Well was tested on Wednesday using a pump lifting 500 gallons an hour and the level of the water fell from 16’ to 18’, but no further, and recovered in a few minutes to 16’ when pumping stopped.  This should be sufficient proof to enable a pump and troughs to be erected in time for the summer.
