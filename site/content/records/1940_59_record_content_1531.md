Weather.  A heavy downpour of rain falling through dust gave a rather dirty 78 points in a short time from 1.30 p.m. on 30 April and 99 points for the week.  The rain was fairly local and petered out before reaching Chalk Cliffs.  Much of the east endured a dust storm.  Mushrooms were sought, but proved to be few.
