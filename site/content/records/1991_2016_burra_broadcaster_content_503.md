NOTE.

From issue No. 57 onwards some news items begin to appear, although for 1992 these were generally limited to a couple of local news items per week.  Sports results [which have not generally been noted] soon begin to be a regular feature.  There were also items of general interest supplied by local politicians and health care workers.  The political pieces pushed political views or explained policy decisions, while the articles on health urged better diet, farm safety, hearing protection or protection against the sun, etc.
