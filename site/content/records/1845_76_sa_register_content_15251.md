The nett value of ore and cash on hand was £27,832-8-10.

The nett profit in 16½ years was £813,120 equal to £330 per share or for every £100 originally invested a dividend payment of £5,500.

Until lately they were raising 12,000 tons of ore p.a. at 22% copper.

More recently this has fallen to about 10,000 tons p.a.

Smelting also employs many.

Kapunda, which is of almost the same age, yields c. 3,000 tons p.a. of 22% copper and employs about 340 persons inclusive of smelters.

Leaving Burra we went via the Karkulto Mine owned by the Burra proprietors.  It is of promise, but so far has been attended with considerable loss in working.

In the Tothill’s Creek area there were some patches of crop amid the pastoralism and this increased towards Kapunda.  None of Sod Hut, Black Springs, Apoinga, Steelton, Marrabel, Hamilton or Allen’s Creek warrants special mention.

At Kapunda the people hope for an extension of the railway to the River Murray, but they are not in favour of its continuation northwards.  [The writer considered their attitude to be based on a misconception and believed Kapunda would benefit from the northern extension of the line.  He also believed it should reach Burra via Clare, although that would add more than twelve miles to the journey.]

[The rest of the article is of a more generally speculative nature with the author’s views on the railway question, the colony’s immigration policy and the opening up of new agricultural land.]
