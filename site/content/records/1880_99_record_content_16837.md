2nd Leader on Council Finances.

In Council and out the feeling is against further loans, but we say the past loans and present overdraft have been a direct gain of no small sum to the Council.  But if there is to be no new loan then the Mayor’s suggestion is the next best way out.

Of the Council debt the sum of £275 is on account of money paid for the Recreation Ground account, comprising interest on bonds and their redemption plus interest on the overdraft to redeem them.

This year another £100 will be expended to redeem another £100 bond.

So £375 to be provided for this year is really due to the Recreation Ground and might fairly be debited to it.

A transfer of this sum to that account would release £375 to be expended from rates and thus available for subsidy, so increasing the amount spent on public works by £750.

The debt on the Recreation Ground would then be £564-0-2, to be reduced by the Park Lands rate.

Cr West should then turn his attention to getting by some means the balance of this sum at a lower rate of interest than the banks charge.

The editor then appends ¾ column of discussion and figures to show that the effect of the previous borrowings, which enabled the council to maximise Government subsidy and maximise spending on public works, was to leave the Council £488-3-4 better off, even taking into account all the interest paid, added to which the town had all the benefit of the works all these years.  Without this borrowing the Council would, since 1878, have had £3,288-3-4 worth of works less than it has had.  They were, he said, paying £131 a year interest and it was decreasing every year.
