Burra Christmas Cheer League.  A meeting to finalise matters was held at Dowling’s Café 17 January.  President Mrs S. Dowling took the chair.  Total receipts were £44-15-2.  Expenditure was £40-12-1 and the balance was £4-13-0.  It was resolved to spend it on an easy chair or chairs for the women’s ward at Burra Hospital.  The evening had been a great success and 500 children and 21 old folk had received presents from the tree and supper was provided for 800 people.
