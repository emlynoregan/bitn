Kooringa News, 24 September

Accident/Obituary.  A miner named Thomas, a resident of Copperhouse, had lately bought a horse and on Saturday was out riding with a friend when the stirrup leather gave way and the man, who was an inexperienced rider, was thrown violently to the ground.  He sustained a severe fracture to the skull and was carried home, where he died in the evening.  He leaves a widow and large family.

[The only Thomas to die at Copperhouse in September 1862 is registered as John Thomas aged 43, who died on 10 September.]

The weather lately has been variable; alternately hot and cold with several violent storms last week bringing wind, rain and hail accompanied by thunder and lightning.  Hot winds and dust followed.  The variability has continued this week.
