The complaint arose because H. Roach, the Record’s Adelaide correspondent on finance, has been barred from sending a telegram to them at press rates except on the days previous to the publication of the paper and would have to pay 1/- for 10 words.  This was another example of pandering to the city at the country’s expense.
