Burra Town Council, 2 December

The Minister of Local Government offers a loan repayable in 5 years at 3½% to be used to give employment to the unemployed on works that would otherwise not be carried out this year.  50% of men are to be drawn from those on Government rations – the others may be single men.  All are to be employed half time.  This was referred to the Finance Committee.

A further letter from Frank Treloar expresses surprise at the Council’s underhanded dealings on the matter of tree removal.

The Burra School Committee wrote about the dangerous road to the school.

Council found there was no road from the north except to Mr Oborn’s house.  The school council was advised to approach the owner of the land with the idea of purchase so that a road could be made.

The mayoral allowance was left at £20.
