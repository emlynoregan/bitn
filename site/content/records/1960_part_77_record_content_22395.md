The Old Jinker.  The SA Government Tourist Bureau has advised the Town Council that a subsidy of £230 has been granted towards the cost of housing the old jinker at the Burra Mine.  The total cost is estimated at £460 and the other £230 will be found by the Town Council and the Burra Branch of the National Trust.  The building is to be erected on the site where the jinker now stands and must be completed by 28 February 1965.
