Patriotic Fund Meeting

This attracted a good attendance on Monday evening at the Institute.  On the platform were the Mayor, E.W. Crewes plus Crs Harris, Lane, Wicklein and Revs Bloyd, Nield, Jennison and Father Kett and Messrs W.G. Hawkes and C.A. Fuss with the Burra Coronation Band.

After the National anthem the Mayor delivered a stirring patriotic speech.

Money had already begun to be collected for the Patriotic Fund.

On Tuesday Mrs Crewes was calling a meeting to establish a branch of the Red Cross Society.

There would be finance, musical and sports committees.  The finance committee would distribute the funds raised.

⅓ would go to the Prince of Wales’ Fund.

⅔ would be distributed locally as needed.

The Institute Committee was organising a monster performance of the choral and orchestral classes soon with over 100 performers.

Slips were distributed and provision made to enable either a lump sum payment of contributions over time.
