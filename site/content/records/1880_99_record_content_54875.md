Burra Oval.  There is a movement for some permanent cover at the oval.  Now that the Show Soc. and the Friendly Societies’ Picnic Fund both have a credit balance the Corporation might see their way clear to erecting a pavilion for the use of sports and exhibits at show time.  The hire of tents by users of the oval would erect such a building.
