Leighton Christmas Tree.  The usual celebration was given in Leighton Hall for scholars of Leighton & Ayers Schools and for all the tiny tots of the district by Mrs I.J. Warnes prior to the annual strawberry fete.  Usually the events are separate, but busy harvesting operations caused them to be brought together.  Mr & Mrs Warnes have put on the party for 26 years and it began in their first home which stood just beyond where ‘Wahroonga’ now stands, but the occasion soon outgrew this and was moved to the hall.  On this occasion Mr Warnes was absent in the city.
