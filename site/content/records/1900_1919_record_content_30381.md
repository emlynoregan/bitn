Gertrude Pearce, sister of the deceased:

Deceased had had trouble understanding business matters recently and seemed very worried.  She generally confirmed his state of mind as the others had described.

G.E. Dane confirmed the worried state of mind of the deceased.

Dr A.R. Caw:

Deceased came to see him recently claiming he was depressed.  There was nothing physically wrong.  Gave him something to steady his nerves and recommended a holiday.  He said he could not leave due to the contract.  His worry was out of all proportion and by yesterday might have easily reached a stage of mental irresponsibility.

Dr Thomas B. Ashton gave evidence of the scene of the suicide, which was confirmed by that of Cpl F. Gibbons.

The coroner’s verdict was ‘death by shooting himself with a rifle in the ruins of the old Bible Christian Church, Kooringa on Sept. 19 1911, and that at the time he was of an unsound mind.’
