Kooringa News, 7 April

Accident.  One of Mr Vickeryâ€™s shepherds was in Redruth yesterday to get a horse shod.  While waiting he imbibed rather freely and on mounting his horse and starting off furiously, as was his custom when in such a state, the horse shied or stumbled and threw him off.  He was dragged a few yards, suffering a severe cut above the eyes and was unconscious for several hours.  He is not yet out of danger.
