It is hoped ratepayers will approve of this forward move.  Detailed enlarged plans are on view at the Council.  Questions may be addressed to Councillors or the Council Office.  The Town Hall would still have a rather Spartan stage, no theatre lighting, lack of backdrop changes and difficult changing from picture theatre to concert hall etc.
