Mr Ray McCallum, President of the Northern Show Societies, from Orroroo opened the show.

Junior Miss Show Girl was Mary-Anne Shipard.

Sub-Junior Miss Show Girl was Carolyn Armstrong of Burra.

In the open shearing contest L. Hughes and A. Talent both scored 187 points and there was a shear-off to decide the winner, with Arthur Talent coming out on top.  The judges were Tony Ryan and Graham Heine.

Greg Germein won the Novice Section.

Art entries were of a very high standard.

Budgerigars were of a good standard with some excellent young birds.

Pigeons were a big improvement on last year’s display.

Poultry were well staged, but the number of shows held on the same day made it hard to get a large show of top birds.

Children’s pets were well displayed and covered a wide range from a goat to a white mouse.

Cattle had some good heifers, but generally carried less condition than in 1975.

Cooking was of a good standard with notably good cheesecake, boiled fruit cake and chocolate cake entries.

Junior entries were impressive.

Flowers were down a bit due to the season, but there was a fair display and some very good blooms.

Floral Art was good, with outstanding entries under ‘Á Song Title’.  The children’s section was a pleasure to judge.

Grain entries were down, but of good quality.

Fodder entries reflected a dry season.

Goat entries showed good potential in the young stock.

Needlework entries were down, but work on the whole was good, especially in the Crochet Cloth.

Produce entries were few.  The winning sauce entry was excellent.

Vegetable entries were down due to the severely cold winter.  Quality was, however, a little better.

Poll sheep were of excellent quality and the Champion Ram was excellent.

The Champion Ewe was an excellent breeder with a thick covering of strong wool.

In the medium wool section the entries were of a high standard and numbers were high.

The Champion Strong Wool Ram carried a good bulky 58’s fleece.

The ewe section was particularly strong in both numbers and quality.

Wool:

The fleeces shown were particularly well grown and many fleeces weighed in excess of 10 kg.
