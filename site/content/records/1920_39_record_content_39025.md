Shell Co. Dance.  The Shell Co. is to hold a dance in every town in Australia on 29 August and Mr T.H. Woollacott has been tireless in making arrangements.  The Institute Hall is engaged and so the SAFU store, now vacant, (but late [Bence’s] Cash & Carry Store) will be used.  The Shell Co. makes no condition about the disposal of the money raised, but has suggested some might go to the Young People’s Unemployment Fund.  The Shell Co. is paying for the music to be broadcast on three wireless stations including 5AD and Horton Jennison will provide the receiving set.
