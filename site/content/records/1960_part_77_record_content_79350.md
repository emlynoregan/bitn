Frank McMahon has won this year’s C.J. Dennis prize for narrative poetry at the Adelaide Festival.  He had written no poetry until ten months ago and had begun writing while convalescing from a series of illnesses.  He had been introduced to C.J. Dennis as a boy – both his father and an uncle had been WWI veterans and C.J. Dennis devotees.  His winning poem is titled Chapel Street Burra SA.
