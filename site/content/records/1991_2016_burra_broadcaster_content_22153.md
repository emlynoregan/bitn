Princess Royal Station has been sold to C.R. & S. Pty Ltd for an undisclosed sum.  Princess Royal comprises 21,694 acres and was first taken up in 1845.  It features in the district’s early mining history when a shepherd discovered copper there.  Following this discovery two groups of investors, known as the Nobs and the Snobs, took up a mining lease.  Each developed a mine.  The Nobs developed the Princess Royal Mine, but it failed to deliver the same riches as the Monster Mine of the Snobs.  Since 1864 only two families have owned the station; the McCullochs till 1900 and the Tennant family since then.  Mr Simon Rowe of C.R. & S. Pty Ltd said the property would predominantly be used as a cattle property, though sheep and cattle would remain a part of the program.  The purchase would dovetail well with other operations of the T & R Group.  Cattle will be bred at Wertaloona Station and will come to Princess Royal before going to the C.R. 7 S. feedlot west of Clare and thence on to the abattoir at Murray Bridge.  Cropping at the ‘Royal’ would contribute to the fodder and grain needs of the feedlot.  The property is well-known for its magnificent heritage-listed homestead.  Designed by Edmund Wright, this two-storey stone house was built in 1864 and sits in a beautiful park-like garden on the banks of the Burra Creek.  Mr Simon Rowe, his wife Andrea and their children will live at Princess Royal.  [Photo of the homestead.]
