He began by predicting a triumph soon for the conservative forces due to the failure of the Liberals to deliver a more flourishing colony.

He spoke of the need to encourage pastoralism.

He spoke against the State Advances Bill.

On a free trade treaty with New Zealand he said it would not be to our advantage and would be detrimental to the interests of other Australian colonies and thus an impediment to federation.
