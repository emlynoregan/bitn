Burra Town Hall

A plan was discussed at a public meeting on 30 May to provide:

Better supper room facilities.

Rooms where meetings could be held.

Additional office space.

Improvements for the library.

This would involve a new library building on the western side of the existing building with a main room approximately 45 ft x 25 ft with an entrance from the south side.  The existing library room would be taken over, the walls removed, making a large room, which could be served by a kitchen, to be erected on the western wall.  In the front section partitions to be erected to form a room that could be used by the CWA thereby making available the large room now used by that organisation for additional office space.  This would leave the Council Chamber free.  Another meeting is called to discuss the proposal and hear any other proposal on 1 July, and if a decision is then reached a committee will be formed.
