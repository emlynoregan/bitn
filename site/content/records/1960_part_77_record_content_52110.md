Centenary of the Railway to Burra

A double-headed steam train pulled by two Rx class locomotives (numbers 207 & 224) will bring 250 passengers to Burra to celebrate the centenary of the opening of the railway.  They are scheduled to arrive at 12.45 p.m., the same time the first train arrived at the opening of the line.  Rx locomotives were used on the line from 1906 to 1926.  They will use the old turntable before starting for Adelaide at 3 p.m.  100 years ago 3,000 people gathered for the arrival of the first train.  The select train bearing the Governor of Sa arrived at 1 p.m.  This yearâ€™s trip has been organised by the Australian Railway Historical Society in conjunction with the Burra Tourist Committee.  The passengers will invade the town in chartered buses to visit local points of interest.  Other visitors will come by car.  Dr John Wilson has written a publication commemorating the event with many photographs of locomotives and trains on the Northern Line.  It will be available on the day at c. $1.50.
