Marriage.  Rostrevor College Chapel last Saturday

Frank Cousins, second son of Mr & Mrs Pat Cousins, married

Betty Dewhirst, only daughter of Mr & Mrs Ron Dewhirst of Boboorowie.

Frank is the winner of the Mail Medals for 1953 & 1954 and Captain of the Booborowie Football Team.  It is understood he will live in future at Spalding and if he is available to play for that team in the coming season it will be a great gain by the Blue & Whites.
