Mintaro News, 29 February

An alarming fire broke out during the week on Mr Leviâ€™s Gum Creek Run.  An extensive tract was burnt.  It started within two miles of the line of telegraph from Clare to Burra Road and ran for 12 miles towards Bundaleer and 4 miles wide between Hill Town and Burra.  About 70 persons battled the blaze.  The overseer Mr Hanquest assisted them with horses, food and liquors.  An inquest will be held today at Cross Roads Inn.

The disease amongst cattle, which I first reported in your columns, is still raging.  Many cattle are dying.  I do not believe it to be pleuro-pneumonia, not is it contagious.  One or two in a herd may die and the others exhibit no symptoms of disease whatsoever.
