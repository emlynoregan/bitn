Burra High School break-up on 19 December is reported.  It was held in the school’s large assembly room.  A concert preceded the presentation of prizes by Dr Steele.

Head Master’s Report:

Attendance in 1939 equalled the best year of 1938.  He spoke of the importance of that ‘American term" Consumer Education”’.  In the year great effort had been put into adapting the assembly room to the school’s needs with equipping the stage and its lighting and cataloguing of library books.  There has been new equipment in Domestic Arts and a new typewriter.  The annual inter-school sports at Riverton was a happy occasion with some good individual results, though the school finished third.  Charlie Hopkins, Ken Fuller & Ellen Byles did well.  The Premier, Hon. T. Playford opened the alterations to the Burra School on 25 August.  He extended thanks to the School Council and the Parents and Friends Assoc. and the Old Scholars assoc.

The prize list is printed on page 4.

Dux of the school was Bethel Smith.

Top of Intermediate (General) was Valerie Phillips

Top of Intermediate (Commercial) was Ken Phillips

Intermediate Certificates (1938) went to Robert Goble, Donald White, June Armstrong, Jessie Morrison & Bethel Smith and were completed by Dorothy McConnon & Glen Kakoschke.

Leaving Certificate to Patricia Aughey, who topped the state in Bookkeeping, and certificates were completed by Milton Rice and Tom Ford.

Dr Steele said a former student, Miss Mavis Riggs, would leave for overseas as a nurse with the 2nd AIF.

The concert then continued, ending with the play The Stolen Prince.
