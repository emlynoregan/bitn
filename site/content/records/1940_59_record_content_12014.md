Obituary.  W. Humphrey Sandland died very suddenly on the night of 9 November.  He was born at Mannanarie 17 February 1884, the second son of the late Mr & Mrs Thomas Sandland of Burra.  When he was 8 the family came to live at Heathmount as his father had large interests in the district.  He was educated at St Peter’s College and after school went into pastoral work.  His late father built up an excellent type of merino and Koo-owie sheep soon grew to prominence.  Mr Tod Sandland [as he was known] was as keen as his father and was an excellent flock master and recognised as a good judge of merino sheep.  His sheep were always in demand and when auctioned his wool often topped the market in Adelaide’s annual wool sales.  His clips were recognised as some of the best in the state.  He owned and personally supervised Balah, Redcliffe and Aldina Stations.  His pastoral interests precluded him taking part in public matters, but he was interested in sport.  In his young days he played polo and later tennis and bowls.  He was a trustee of the Burra Sports Association Ground and a Director of the Burra Electric Supply Co.  He married Mrs C.F. Humphris nee Miss Stella Lord who survives.  He also leaves two brothers: Mr Philip Sandland, pastoralist of WA and Mr K. Chesters Sandland, manager of Goldsbrough Mort & Co. Ltd, Maitland.  And two sisters: Mrs M.R. Ashton of Burra North and Miss Elsie Sandland who resides in England.  [William Humphrey Sandland.]
