Marie Abbott celebrated her 100th birthday on 23 October.  A family party was held at her daughter Mary’s home in Adelaide.  Mrs Abbott made the delicious scones for the occasion.  Among the acknowledgements were letters from the Queen, the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and other Parliamentarians.  There was also a papal blessing from Pope Benedict XVI.

Mrs Abbot was born Marie Hogan at Leighton on 23 October 1912.  She attended Leighton Primary School until the age of 10 and then went to St Joseph’s Convent in Spalding, where she also learnt to play violin and piano.  She went to school by horse and cart.  Later she went on to teach music, mostly in the Booborowie area and often travelled to lessons by horse and sulky.  Mrs Abbott played the church organ until she was 90.  She fondly remembers sing-a-longs around the piano in the days before television or radio.  She also recalls when the evening entertainment was often bridge or euchre around the table or going to her grandparents’ house to listen to concerts on the wireless or to neighbour’s houses to listen to the match commentary when Australia played England for the Ashes.  She finds the biggest changes in her lifetime were the result of cars, telephones and electricity.  When she was first married she lived in an uninsulated prefab house that was very hot in summer.  There was neither a fridge nor a washing machine and the fire had to be lit to get any hot water.  After the birth of their third child they got a kerosene refrigerator.
