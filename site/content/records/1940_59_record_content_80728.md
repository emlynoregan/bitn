E.J. Sara writes re the bands on the Burra School building.  John G. Sara used to say he mixed the mortar for the bands as a boy and later attended the school before becoming a pupil teacher there.  G. & W. Sara were the contractors for the school and for the Anglican Church.  [Contractors were G. & W. Sara & Dunstan.  Stories of John G. Saraâ€™s early education are varied and unreliable.  He was born in 1863 and is rather unlikely to have attended the Burra Model School, which opened in 1878, as a pupil.  He probably went there as a pupil teacher.]
