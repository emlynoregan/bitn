Obituary.  John Wilks who died recently was born in Wales in 1845 and left for SA with his parents at an early age.  They came directly to Burra.  He worked as a boy and then as a man under Captain I. Killicoat at the Burra Smelting Works.  When these closed he worked with his brother for twelve months at Wonna and then took up butchering with his brother-in-law the late W.A. Stewart at Saddleworth.  In 1873 he married Miss Christina Stewart, third daughter of Alexander and Ann Stewart of the White Hart Hotel.  After a few years he took land at Mt Bryan East and carried on farming and grazing until his death.  For four years he was on the Hallett DC.  He leaves a widow, five sons and one daughter.  There are six grandchildren.
