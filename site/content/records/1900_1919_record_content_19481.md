Burra Smelts [Burra Copper Slag Smelting Co.]  The furnace to treat the slag is now ready and work is to start after the holidays.  In contrast with the outlay of the Burra Slag Extraction Co., behind which were Messrs Martin & Co., this company is poised to make a better profit.  It is expected to extract 1Â½% from stuff that went through the Burra Slag Extraction Co. process and there are hundreds of tons not touched which will go up to something like 50-60%.  There will be no washing away of tailings and every bit of copper will be extracted.  It is expected to run two shifts of at least six men each.
