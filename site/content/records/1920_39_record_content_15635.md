Aberdeen Football Club met in Jubilee Hall 9 April.  Regrets were expressed that the Burra Association had gone into recess following a lack of interest when meetings were called recently.  When Aberdeen suggested a combined Burra side only ten men turned up at a meeting and only three were players.  With so little interest shown the Burra Association met and decided to go into recess.

It was decided to continue with the Aberdeen Club.  Elected were Patron, James Reed; President, J.H. Gallagher; Chairman, M.A. Radford.
