Burra-Adelaide Road

After some twelve months of preliminary work, an all out effort is to be made on the new road via Hanson and Manoora to Saddleworth.  The DC of Burra Burra and the Saddleworth DC are busy at present.  Burra has seven miles to work on from Hanson.  This is a new road from scratch, requiring much filling.  Material for the road sub-base will come from Hogan’s quarry at Hanson.  This new route is the shortest practicable route to bituminise.  At some later date the Marrabel to Black Springs road will be sealed.  The Highways Department takes over the job of bituminising.
