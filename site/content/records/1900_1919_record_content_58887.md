Burra Burra Hospital Board of Guardians.

The new Board met for the first time.

Mr A.J. McBride was nominated Chairman by Mr Warnes and 2nd Mr Winnall.

Mr Winnall was nominated by Mr Radford, but declined.

Mr McLaren was nominated by Mr Radford, but declined.

Mr Crewes thought Mr Radford had in mind a resident Chairman, which Mr McBride was not.  Though Mr Crewes had no personal feelings in the matter, he felt a resident Chairman was preferable.

Mr Winnall did not believe in changing horses mid-stream.

Mr McBride was elected.

(Other members were Messrs Bartholomaeus, Warnes, Dane, Crewes, McLaren, Radford, Winnall, McWaters, Dr Williams and the new members: Major L.A. Lewis & Mr Ruthven.)[[

[Mr Lane seems to have resigned.]

[The last meeting of the old Board had gone into committee to discuss certain matters, which were of course not able then to be reported in the paper.  It now becomes clear that the complaints from nurses had resulted in that meeting in committee asking the Matron to resign.]

The two probationers concerned had asked to be allowed to resign and this request was granted.

Mr Winnall was against the drastic action proposed by the committee and especially in the present condition of the town [a reference to influenza].  No steps had been taken to fill vacancies generated by the decision.

Mr McWaters held that the carrying out of the decision was in Mr Winnall’s hands.

Winnall [who apparently had taken no action to implement the decision] held that the committee should also have taken action to fill the vacancy created.  He was solidly against the decision to dismiss the Matron after three years of faithful service without the breath of a complaint.  He was against the adoption of the minutes, which would see them implemented.  He was glad that Nurse Cranston had come and gone after complaining about the Matron and her management of the hospital.

Mr Crewes & Mr McWaters held that the new members should not vote, not having heard the evidence.

Mr Winnall was determined not to have the institution’s future controlled by the word of two probationers.  He said it amounted to two probationers saying that if the Matron were not dismissed they would leave: it was laughable if it had not proved tragical. [sic]

Mr Crewes thought that the probationers had proved their case.

Mr Winnall would use his last breath to see the injustice undone.  Boiled down to its essentials Nurse Birdseye’s greatest complaint was a shortage of utensils.

The Matron replied that as breakages were often not reported, she did not always know of the shortages.

The other serious complaint was that the Matron, one night, refused to come and help her move a patient and the patient had to wait two hours till Nurse Hermann came on duty.  Nurse Birdseye’s version of events was uncorroborated.

[Winnall then goes on a flight of fancy constructing a scenario he believed more likely to be what happened, but which is equally uncorroborated.]
