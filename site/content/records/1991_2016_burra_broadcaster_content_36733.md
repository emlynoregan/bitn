Fire.  At 2.20 a.m. on Sunday morning passing youths raised the alarm that the BCS meat bird shed was on fire.  The steel-framed shed, normally full of meat birds grown by the students for sale, was empty.  An electrical malfunction is believed to have caused the fire, which produced about $10,000 damage.  Chickens in the nearby fowl shed escaped harm, even though the heat was sufficient to melt their shed door.  The pigs in a shed only three metres away also escaped harm and surprisingly the open hay shed, which was within a metre also survived.  [Photo.]
