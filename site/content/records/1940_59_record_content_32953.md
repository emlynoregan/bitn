Lightning Football & Basketball Carnival.  The Mayor said it was an expression of faith in the town.  The Football Club intends to donate 75% of the proceeds towards liquidating the Town Hall debt and 25% towards the War Memorial Fund.  Once the debt is liquidated it will be possible to improve the hall by the addition of a supper room â€“ it is one of the few Town Halls without one.
