Burning Effigies.

There was great excitement in Burra on Monday when it became known that two residents, one from Kooringa and one from Aberdeen, were to be hung and burned in effigy for writing letters against the miners in Broken Hill.  At 7 p.m. a large crowd assembled at Opie’s Hotel and the conveyance with the effigies led 20 fellows with black faces who were to act as bearers, and then came cabs, buggies, horsemen and bicycles.  The procession went first to the Court House Hotel, then to the Bon Accord Hotel, where three cheers were raised for the miners.  The Broken Hill express was met at the station and messages were given for the passengers to deliver to Broken Hill.  Then the procession went to the Royal Exchange Hotel where letters were read and a vote in favour of the miners was taken.  The Brass Band then led the way to Kooringa (with the captain on a horse in front of them).  At the Institute the writer was invited into the buggy to give his reasons for writing the letter, but he declined.  The procession went on to the Burra and Kooringa Hotels and ended at the Commercial Hotel where a collection raised £12 – J. Sampson and H. Vivian each giving £5.  A concert was proposed to raise funds.

At the rear of the Commercial Hotel a gallows was raised and here the death sentence was passed and the two figures were hanged for about five minutes, after which death was declared.  After that a young lady set fire to the kerosene-soaked figures and they were burnt to ashes.  The crowd made their way home about 10.30 p.m. having witnessed the most peculiar and amusing affair every held in Burra.
