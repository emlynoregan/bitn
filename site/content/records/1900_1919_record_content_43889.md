Letter from ‘Bandsman’ re Patriotism

The Burra Show society enquired about the Band’s terms for playing at the show, given it was a patriotic function.  The Band decided to play for £5-5-0, to defray expenses – little more than half the usual fee.  The Show Society refused and accused the Band of being unpatriotic.  The Show Society itself will pay all over expenses to the patriotic fund – not all, but all over expenses.  Did they ask anyone else working that day to do so without pay?  I guess not!  Did they ask the sideshow men to contribute their takings?

‘Again where was our show committee’s patriotism when [deciding on] prizes for the best German cake.’

He then outlines their patriotic activities:

Sacred concert for Cheer-up funds

Sacred concert for Soldiers’ Aid funds
