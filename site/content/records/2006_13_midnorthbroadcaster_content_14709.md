BRTBA President Peter Edson says this month’s Antique Fair exceeded expectations and this has prompted a call for a sub-committee to maintain the success.  The success brings a great benefit to our businesses and the whole community.  Mr Edson paid tribute to the enormous effort put in by Ken Jacobs, Leonie Ambler and Paul Marsson.  He said that with Leonie and Paul now stepping down it was up to all of us in the Burra Community to see that the event continues to be a success.  BRTBA is now calling for people who are willing to step up and join the sub-committee to begin the organisation of the 2013 fair.  The traders have already committed to returning next year and it is now up to the community to see that their commitment is matched by our own.
