At a meeting on 9 June it was decided to form a second Bowling Association independent of the Mid-North Bowling Association (of which Burra and Spalding are members).  The new Association is to be the North-Eastern Bowling Association and it will comprise two teams from Hallett and one each from Spalding and Burra.  Each team for now is to comprise three rinks.  Election of officers: President, George terry and Secretary, H. Binks-Williams.

[The paper explains why the new Association was formed, but it gives a reason which is the opposite of what would make sense.  It reads:

‘The main object … is to ensure as far as possible that all member, [sic] paricularly [sic] with respect to Burra and Spalding, are unable to participate in pennant games either in the existing Mid-North Association or the newly formed North-Eastern Association.]
