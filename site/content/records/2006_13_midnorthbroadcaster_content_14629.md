[This ‘tower’ had been built in 1910 behind the then Burra Record office in Market Square.  It was a three storey wood and iron structure designed as a photographic studio.  It was destroyed by fire in December 1950.  See Burra Record, VX, 897 (2), 13 July 1910, page 2, Burra Record VX, 902, 17 Aug. 1910, page 3 and Burra Record, 76, 50, 19 Dec. 1950, page 1.]
