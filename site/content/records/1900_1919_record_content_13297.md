Short & Sharp

Rev. Hanton is President of the Methodist Conference for 1906-07.

Despite poor prospects in Burra new buildings are still going up.

Lady canvassers are collecting for a piano for the Burra Hospital.

Arrangements are being made for a cheap train fare for children to attend the Adelaide Exhibition.

Ensign and Mrs Good are working hard to lift the local Salvation Army out of its indolent state.

Members of the Burra Amusement Club are rehearsing a concert.

Very little has been heard of the notorious Macklvie since he spoke of that enormous malachite reef at Princess Royal.
