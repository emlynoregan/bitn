Mr E.W. Dunhill will preach at Kersbrook Methodist Church on Sunday.  It was there, 50 years* ago, that he commenced his lay preaching and he wished to do so again before closing his years of service as a layman in the church service.  He will be staying with his sister, Mrs Crooks.

[This is an error for 60 years.]
