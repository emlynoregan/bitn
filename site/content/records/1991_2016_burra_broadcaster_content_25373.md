Burra Penguin Club sponsored the local heat of the Rostrum Voice of Youth 2001 at BCS on 17 May.  President Donna Kelly welcomed the four speakers.  Being juniors, each had to give a six minute prepared speech on a topic of their choice, followed by a three minute speech chosen from four set topics, with fifteen minutes to prepare.  The contestants were Katie Thomas, Melissa Williams, Sarah Earle and Amy Wilson.  Katie Thomas was the winner and went on to the semi-final on Saturday, where, although she did not win, she acquitted herself admirably.
