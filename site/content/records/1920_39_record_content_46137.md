Obituary.  Mr D.A. Seigert of Hallett died 28 May aged 72.  He was well known in sporting and public matters in Hallett and was rarely equalled as a handicapper and starter and will be sorely missed at the next sports meeting.  He is survived by a widow and a grown-up family of two sons and three daughters.  [Daniel August Seigert] [Extended obituary see 54, 23, 7 June 1923, page 2.]
