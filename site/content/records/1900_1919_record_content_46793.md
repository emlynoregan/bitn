Soldiers’ Aid Society AGM was held last Wednesday.  Mr Crewes presided.  The secretary reported:

Meetings have been held fortnightly and garments given out to be made at home, knitting only being done at meetings.  Fortnightly evening meetings were held for a while to produce sandbags.  The Boy Scouts helped with this and 2,120 bags were made.  Several concerts were given by a band of little girls at Hampton and also a Bazaar in Jubilee Hall.  The society numbers about 110.  In the year we have produced 361 sheets and 361 pillowcases, 124 towels, 36 pairs of pyjamas, 23 flannelette shirts, 36 flannel undershirts, 13 dressing gowns, 140 kitbags, blankets and rugs, 11 pairs of blankets & 1 single, 3 rugs, 263 pairs of socks, 51 scarves, 92 face-washers, 55 Balaclava caps, 12 c. belts [cholera?] 85 mittens and gloves, 101 handkerchiefs, 18 housewives, 3 pairs of slippers, bundles of old linen, 1 case of jam and 24 Christmas billycans.

We have assisted in Australia day on 30 July, provided luncheon at the Sheep Dog Trials, helped on French Flag Day with the pie stall, raised over £50 for the Burra Ambulance Fund and are working for Red Cross Fete Day.  The Balance Sheet audited by C. Fuss is printed.

Elected for 1916-17 were: President, Mrs Bloyd; Vice-President, Mrs Bartholomaeus; Hon. Sec., Mrs F. Sara & Treasurer, Mrs A. Wallis.  [The committee included Mrs C. Fuss.]

Cr Killicoat expressed his appreciation of the work done.

C. Fuss followed on and said the Society had also given two beds to the hospital and one through Mrs Griffiths.  The Mayor also gave an address of appreciation.

Musical items were given by Miss Griffiths, Mr R. Fuss & Mr N.J. Tiddy.
