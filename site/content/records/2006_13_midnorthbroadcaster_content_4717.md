Burra’s Heritage Sites on the Passport Trail are suffering from a lack of maintenance following the end of a contract between the Council and the National Trust some 18 months ago.  Maintenance of Council owned sites is below expectations according to Council Acting CEO Bill Mader.  Negotiations between the National Trust and the Council have been drawn out and the Trust has refused to disclose site work and expenditure on all sites since the contract is no longer valid.  The National Trust in about October 2006 reduced the commission given to the Burra Visitor Centre for the sale of the Passport from 30% to 17.5% because the Trust was incurring increased costs of maintenance.  Following the last Council meeting the Council’s share of the Passport income will now go directly to the Council, which will maintain its own sites.  The future of the Passport remains under discussion.
