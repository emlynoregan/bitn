Edward Wright, Secretary of the PRMC said he did not pay the order when it was presented on 1 October because it had been altered.  Mr Morphett was one of the directors at the time.

The jury found the accused guilty of forgery and of uttering.

The prisoner was then charged with forging and uttering another order on the same day, 16 September.  Originally issued for £5-4-4 to Zacharia Grey, it had been passed for £12-4-4.

The accused was again found guilty.

Two character witnesses were called: Thomas Coombes and John Cousins.

The prisoner had a wife and three children.

Sentencing was deferred.
