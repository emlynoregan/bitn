Railway Extension Meeting at Saddleworth

The meeting was held at Mr Siekmann’s corn store at Saddleworth 18 September.

Mr Arthur Coleman JP presided.  The object was to forward strong arguments to the Government in favour of a railway or a tramway to Saddleworth through a petition.

Mr E. Siekmann thought the Government should either privatise the railway or else extend it.  To leave it as it is was to retard the progress of the colony.  There was talk that an English company would be prepared to extend it north.  The railway should be extended to a place which could show that it would be most productive and to which it could be completed most cheaply and also which would open up the best part of the colony.  Promoters of the Pt Wakefield line made much of the 300,000 acres that had been sold west of the Skilly Ranges, but he believed much of this was held by agent for pastoralists.  The argument that it would be benefit the people of Blyth and Hoiles Plains etc. failed if there was to be no great quantity of produce to shift.

He moved that the time had come to extend the railway from Freeling or Roseworthy through the Gilbert Valley east of Mintaro to some point at or near Burra.  W.H. Harry seconded and Mr James Milne supported it.  He pointed out that the Gilbert Valley was without good natural roads and that little had been spent on making roads either.

S. Dawson spoke in support, saying railways or tramways were needed to open up new land to provide for a growing population – though he wished the motion had not specified the route.

Mr Milne replied that the suggested route was the most central to the area with large tracts of agricultural land on either side.

Mr Thomas Jones expressed his disgust with the roads and supported the motion, which passed unanimously.

G.W. Byerlee then moved that such a line would pass through very thickly populated and productive country and would bring the pastoral country to the north into direct communication with the present line, the city and its port.  He did not like the idea of a tramway, preferring to see a locomotive at the front of the train.  The amount of money laid out on northern roads was ‘a mere bagatelle’.  Last season he had seen at times 40 to 50 drays passing his house and now he scarcely saw one because the roads were so poor.  People drove off the roads and made tracks through private property.

Mr Gurr seconded the motion.  It was necessary to have speed in conveying their produce whether by a tramway or railway.  Farmers could send down 200 or 300 bushels of wheat when it was opportune instead of storing it and trusting to wheat merchants for a return.  Vast areas of agricultural land would be opened up.  The Kapunda line had seen large sales of land in that district.  Many northern mines would become viable with a railway, he believed.  The motion was carried unanimously.

W.G. Cole said the strongest agitation had been for a line from Pt Wakefield to Auburn, but as others had said, there was not sufficient land along that route to produce a revenue and the route up the Gilbert would pass through one of the richest agricultural districts of the colony.  It would open country north of Burra and provide for the easy conveyance of stock.  He moved for the formation of a committee to draw up a petition, collect signatures and see it presented.  John Moule seconded the motion, pointing out that having become the greatest wheat producing colony in Australia, an extension of railways was needed to protect their position as Victoria was rapidly extending a network of railways and land was being placed in the possession of farmers on easy terms.  Carried without dissent.
