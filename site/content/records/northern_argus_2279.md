Chairman Maureen Wright reported on the past year.  The major project had been the Bon Accord Mine Site & Museum.  A grant of $11,283 came from the History Trust of SA and $30,000 from Burra’s Jubilee 150 grant, combined with much voluntary labour to produce a fine museum display.  Colin Fidock was responsible for the preparation of the graphics and pictures – a job requiring much research and most of his spare time.  Pam Marlow’s Monster Mine Model is one of the highlights of the museum.  The Branch has recently applied to the History Trust of SA for an archaeological study leading to a better understanding of the Bon Accord history.

In 1987 the branch will undertake further restoration work at Redruth Gaol, funded by the Commonwealth Bank.  It is one of six sites in Australia to be funded as part of their $500,000 ‘Heritage 88 Project’ and represents SA’s portion.

This $50,000 will enable much needed restoration and upgrading of the approach to the gaol and to the car park.

This year saw the installation of enamel interpretive signs at all our main sites and identification signs.  A grant of $1,500 from the Department of Tourism was matched by the Burra National Trust.

In 1986 Mr John restored Burra’s first [motorised] fire engine – a Model T Ford.  The MFS believes it is SA’s oldest motorised fire engine and the oldest Model T fire engine in Australia.  The other two fire engines owned by the Branch took part in the Bay to Birdwood Run last year – the Diamond T and the Denis.  On the drive home the 1936 Diamond T clocked up its first 5,000 miles.

The Branch now urgently needs a building to house them.  Elected: Chairman, Maureen Wright; Vice-Chairman Management, Helen Stockman; Vice-Chairman Works & Buildings, Barry Wright; Vice-Chairman Fundraising & Catering, Audrey Little; Secretary, Robyn Page and Treasurer pro tem Avian Pink.

Bob Lewis was the guest speaker.  Bob is President of the National Trust SA and a son of Essington Lewis.
