Governor Sir Donald Dunstan & Lady Dunstan will attend the Burra Civic Ball in the Town Hall on 7 June.  Queen’s Scouts and Venturers led by Mr David Jennings will form a guard of honour.  The Dance Victoriana Troupe will demonstrate old time dances and Morey Paley’s Dance Orchestra from Adelaide will provide the music.  Research is being done into a suitable décor and Barry Wright of the Town Hall Committee said they were considering removing the panels from the turned wood balustrades.  This had been placed there to prevent young picture show patrons from rolling bottles and other objects onto the audience below.  The gallery would accommodate about 50 non-dancers for the evening.
