Inquest & Obituary.  The inquest on the death of Jack Winter is reported at considerable length: the article runs to almost 2 columns.  It all adds very little to the bare facts already noted.  Evidence was given by Dr Ashton and by Dr Steele, who did the post mortem.  Others giving evidence were: George Lines, Thomas P. Halls, James McDonald, Albert Johnson & M-C Skinner.  There was no definite single cause of death and Dr Steele was of the opinion that the deceased was generally in very poor health due to heavy long term alcohol abuse and believed the cause of death was septic intoxication.  The jury eventually agreed.  [Also previous issue page 3.]
