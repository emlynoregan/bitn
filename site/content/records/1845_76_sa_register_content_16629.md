Kooringa News, 20 May

Winter has come with cold and wet conditions all day Sunday and then a good deal of rain overnight.  Drizzle and showers have continued.

At the Burra Mine there is the report of a new lode being discovered.  I trust the report is true because there are a number of miners recently returned from Newcastle.
