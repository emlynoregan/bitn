Larrikinism.  J. Rooney, tried to sue T.T. Shortridge and A. Fordham for hissing his performance at the entertainment after the Oddfellows’ sports, on the grounds that it was of such a nature as was likely to cause a breach of the peace, but the case was dismissed without costs.

‘Cynic’ wonders why the ratepayers’ meeting to discuss what to do with the money borrowed to survey the town hasn’t come off.

‘I think the Councillors are afraid to do so, for fear some of the ratepayers living in the back part of the town would get a bit of a footpath to enable them to get out of their houses without stilts this wet weather.’

He also criticises J. Rooney.
