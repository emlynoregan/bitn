Major Gilbert Lewis appears in a fine illustration in the Observer with a group of Indian officers and Mr Ezra in civilian dress.  He was sent to London on 14 January to show the officers around.  (They were on 9 days leave.)  They were received by the Lord Mayor of Birmingham and had over an hour’s interview with the King at Buckingham Palace.  Major Lewis served with the Imperial Bushmen under Col. Rowell in the Boer War and Lord Roberts gave him a commission in the Imperial Army.  Lord Kitchener transferred him to the Indian Army after the war and he is Major in the King George’s Central Indian Horse.
