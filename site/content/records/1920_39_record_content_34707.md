Mr & Mrs Hawkes were farewelled from Black Springs at a social held in the Black Springs Hall 26 June.  Speeches were interspersed with musical and elocutionary items.  Horace Dunn took the chair.  Mr & Mrs Hawkes had been great supporters of the Anglican Church and prime movers in the erection of the Hall.  Mr Hawkes had always been active in public affairs and was one of the most prominent stud Merino breeders in Australia.

K. Chesters Sandland also spoke of the family’s contribution to the district, of the sacrifice of Robert Hawkes, their son, in the Great War and of Mrs Hawkes’ role as a Christian helper and comforter and of Mr Hawkes’ courage in migrating at 15½ to start a new life.

Cr J.A. Heinrich spoke of the Hawkes’ wide circle of friends in the district and of their help in establishing a school at Apoinga.  Mr Hawkes had given the land and helped financially as he had done so frequently in other causes, especially during the Great War.  Mr Hawkes had first entered the [Apoinga] Council in 1894 and except for the period 1910-16 when he retired from Council, he had been Chairman for 30 years.  He would like to thank Mr Hawkes on behalf of ratepayers for sacrificing so much of his time for the district.

H.C. Atkins spoke on behalf of the Hanson District for Mr Hawkes’ financial assistance over the years and for his work on the Burra Hospital Board and his financial support for the Porter’s Lagoon Boat Club.

Howard Turner spoke of Mr Hawkes’ gift for public speaking and his fine Christian character and of the parallel support from Mrs Hawkes.

Rev. J.S.W. Coles said the knowledge he had of Mr Hawkes extended for only three years, but it supported all that had been said by others.

Mr A. Heinrich spoke of Mr Hawkes’ contribution in the cutting up of Koonoona for closer settlement and his public contribution on the Apoinga Council and the Burra Hospital Board and of his wife’s great kindness and generosity to all.

Mr A. Butler said he would add his contribution representing the church that Mr Hawkes had been a prime mover in establishing 38 years ago.

Horace Dunn then presented an illuminated address – the work of George Hann.

Mr Hawkes then spoke at length about those prominent in the district 50 years ago.

[Except for a reference to old Granny Low who used to walk from Black Springs to Burra with butter and eggs for the market, this speech is not reported.]

Mrs Hawkes also made a brief response and supper concluded the evening.
