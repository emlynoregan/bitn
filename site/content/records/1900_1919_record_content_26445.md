Burra Races were held last Wednesday in ideal weather and generally passed off well, though there were several unfortunate occurrences.  [Surely something of an understatement!]

J.M. Cummings’ Myrtle was first past the post and a gate was opened for the entrance to the weighing-in paddock, but before reaching the scales Cummings dismounted and there was naturally a protest which was upheld.

In the Squatter’s Handicap the heavily backed chestnut Rifleman was left standing at the start causing much excitement among backers.

In the Welter the same thing happened with T. Barry’s Sunshine with the veritable Tim Wilks in the saddle.  Four horses ran the race and places were declared, but then something happened [which is not disclosed and appears to be unknown to the reporter] and the race was declared a ‘no start’.  It was then started again and this time Wilks got away and just managed to beat Fortola which had run first in the aborted event.  As the writer not unreasonably observes, if Fortola had not just run two races to Sunshine’s one it would easily have won.

The Hurdle Race failed altogether when only one horse went to the starting post and according to the rules got half the stake.

The results are printed.
