Monster Mining, Banking and ‘The Boiler Not Yet Burst’. 

Gentlemen, the writer begins, the croakers are up and at work.

[The author decries those who say that it will all end in disaster.  Those who claim that as a result of this use of the colony’s funds no bank will lend money, no ship will bring more gold in and business in the colony will be greatly disturbed, if not destroyed, by this payment of £20,000 for a Special Survey.  He goes on to assure readers that the mine certainly contains plenty of copper, which when got out will pay a large direct and indirect profit to all in the Province.  He ends by assuring them that he ‘is sure the mania is over’.]
