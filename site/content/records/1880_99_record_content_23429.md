Public Meeting.  Only a few attended the public meeting chaired by the Mayor on 16 September in the Institute re the Local Government Bill.  F.W. Holder spoke up for the Bill and moved it be supported albeit with some boundary changes and other minor variations.  J. Hoskings 2nd.  Others opposed the move because the main roads would fall to the Town Council under the Bill.  The motion was passed.

Holder considered that the work the Council had done and which was paid for by the ratepayer raised the value of SAMA property infinitely more than they had paid in rates ever since the Council was established, while the tenants who helped pay got no advantage.  He favoured assessments based on unimproved values, which would encourage development.
