A Canadian Convoy

In Friday a convoy of 66 vehicles and 300 Canadian servicemen was heading to Adelaide from Terowie.  As it was passing through Burra the Mayor grabbed a Union Jack and stood in front of the leading Jeep and refused to budge.  He introduced himself to the Adjutant (Captain Reid) and said the town wanted to give the men a Civic Welcome, drinks and ice cream.  The schools had been dismissed to see the convoy and soon the streets was filled with ‘lean brown hard looking soldiers from the place on top of the globe’ mingling with townsfolk and children.  The autograph books came out and the soldiers soon made friends when they distributed chewing gum.  The mayor extended a Civic welcome at the Rotunda with a patriotic speech and was supported by H.J.B. Jennison.  Lieut. Colonel H.D.W. Wehtey had been bringing up the rear of the four-mile-long convoy and arrived just in time to respond to His Worship’s address of welcome.  The hour’s delay kept the Lord Mayor of Adelaide and other dignitaries there waiting to welcome the Canadians, but neither Mt Woollacott nor the Canadians knew of the Adelaide plans.  The Canadians only became aware of that when they reached Kapunda.  On Sunday morning another convoy of thirty vehicles and more than sixty men received a similar welcome in Burra.

[Note from page 3.  Mr E.T. Baulderstone and Mr Bachli were asked, with about 20 minutes notice, if they could supply the several hundred ice-creams required and not only could they, they did so at cost price.]
