Burra Cycling Handicap

Last weekend almost 300 cyclists and associates met in Burra for this year’s handicap.  1990 winner, Brenton McDonald was victorious with Mike Elleway and Mark Piro in the second and third places.  President of SA Wheelman’s Association Mr Des Keegan was happy with the weekend’s events.  He said the SA Wheelman’s Association was keen to stage a Burra to Adelaide race to coincide with Burra’s sesquicentennial celebrations in 1995.
