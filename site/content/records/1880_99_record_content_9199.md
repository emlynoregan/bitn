Redruth Court, 10 January.

Mr Lewis tried to avoid paying a fine for driving around Best Place corner at over 4 m.p.h. by pleading that without a town survey and a town plan lodged there were in fact no town streets.  The bench held that the Corporation Act considered all thoroughfares to be streets and fined him 10/- + 42/- expenses.

Richardson was charged with selling less than 1 gallon of brandy contrary to his storekeeper’s licence.  On 13 December Sheperdson went to the wine and spirit cellar behind Mr Park’s shop and asked for a bottle of brandy, which was supplied for 6/6.  Despite a plea of entrapment and others of a technical nature the defendant was fined £10 plus £3-14-0 costs or 28 days.
