Kooringa Cemetery [An article on the early history of the Cemetery.]

Several preliminary meetings were held before a meeting was held on 8 September 1854, chaired by W.H. Challoner.  The secretary pro tem, Thomas W. Powell, reported on progress.  The committee had requested that SAMA grant an extra half an acre to the existing cemetery and an extension of 12 ft all round for the purpose of planting.  He could now report that SAMA had agreed to the additional land on a 99-year lease, provided that it was fenced and a management committee was initiated, appointed by the public and approved by SAMA directors.  It was decided that iron hurdles would be inadequate and a stone wall was decided upon.  Mr Oliver offered to fence it at 7/- per yard, superficial measurement.  Subscription lists were set up with donors of 50/- to receive a single grave and those of £5 to get a double grave, each for a term of 99 years.  A public meeting was then called for 15 September 1854 in the Wesleyan Schoolroom.

At that meeting it was revealed that £225 had been promised towards the wall and a committee of thirteen was elected: Revs James Pollitt, Matthew Wilson & James Rowe and Messrs W. Varcoe, W.H. Challoner, T. Burgess, T.W. Powell, A. Barker, R.B. Robinson, Thomas Richards, D. Mackay, I. Killicoat & R. Elphick.  A vote of thanks was moved to SAMA for their donation of the lad and £50.

In the early days burial records reveal the high infant mortality.  For example from 1 September 1859 to 31 December 1859 interments total 42, made up as follows:

Aged less than 7	31

Aged 7-20	6

Aged 21-32	4

Aged 62	1

From 1854 to 1864 interments averaged two per week.

No register of interments was kept from June 1864 to 12 June 1881.

[The paper than says the population of Burra was then 15-20,000, but the 1861 census records a population of 4,347.]
