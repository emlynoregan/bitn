Burra town Council, Monday last week.

The Progress Assoc. is to be advised Council will make an entrance from the swing bridge and a pathway along the fence to the new playground.

A post and rail fence will separate the playground from the Caravan Park.

A decision on a proposed by-law about the playground was deferred.

Burra Electric Supply Co. advised that the plant loaned to it by ETSA was in bad repair and could not carry the load required.  They claim, however, that their own machinery is sufficient without additional plant.

The tender of J.D. Salter of £5-10-0 per tree or £49-10-0 for all pine trees to be removed from Kangaroo Street is to lie on the table for a few weeks.
