The Anzac Service was held last Sunday at the Market Square Memorial. The returned men assembled at the RSL Club Rooms.  There was a splendid attendance of RCR members and a parade of members of the VS Detachment and Transport Service, all in smart uniforms. The Girl Guides earlier marched to the Memorial and took up a position on the south side.  The Bowden Salvation Army Citadel Band under Bandmaster A.J. Heaven attended at their own expense and led the procession from the RSL Rooms to the Hospital and then back to the Memorial in Market Square.  The returned men were led by G.S. Hawker and the RCR members by Mr Cyril Collins.  Mrs D. Keynes (formerly Sister Armstrong) was the only nurse present.  Mrs Andrew Tennant, Commandant of the VS Detachment, led the large squad of members with Mrs G.S. Hawker, CO of the Mt Bryan VSD.  The Mayor, Councillors and the town clergy were at the Memorial.  Rev. N. Usher gave the address and he was assisted by Rev. C. Gray (Anglican), Rev. P.N .Potter (Methodist) and Envoy Winfield (Salvation Army).  Wreaths were laid by Mr Hawker, Mayor Woollacott, Sister Keynes and others.  The procession then marched back to the RSL Rooms before being dismissed.
