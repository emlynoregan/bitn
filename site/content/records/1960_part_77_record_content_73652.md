Rate payments of an additional $33,000 to the $20,000 already received have been a welcome response to the Council’s concerns expressed recently, but $70,000 is still outstanding.  Samin has paid $729.90 in royalties under the Old Mining Act.  This covers ore used in the pilot operation in 1971 and to the end of June 1972.

There is now a new Act, but monies due under that have not yet appeared.

It is anticipated that Power Industrial Cleaning Services will have cleaned the pool surface for the application of fibreglass by tomorrow, but Christmas and New Year Holidays mean no further work will be done till 6 January when men from Combo Industries will begin applying fibreglass.  They hope to finish on 10 January and water can then be added to the pool.  Other renovation work will also be done between now and then.  Over 30 panes of glass have been broken in the changing room by vandals.  Filtering of the water will take about a week, so the pool should open somewhere about 17 January.  Tenders have been called for the purchase of the Council’s 1967 Bedford tip truck.
