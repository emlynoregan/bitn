The Education Department has not been satisfied with the condition of the Hallett-Mt Bryan-Burra school bus and cancelled the contract at Christmas.  The old operator was the only tenderer and at a higher rate.  This was rejected.  A new advertisement brought no response and the service lapsed.  Twenty to twenty-four students are affected.  The Department then offered the contract to the old operator at last yearâ€™s price, but he rejected it and another operator was also unwilling to do the work.  A solution is imperative.  Why does the Department not get its own bus and pay teachers to drive it?  As well as High School students about a dozen Primary School students were carried to Mt Bryan and another half a dozen to Burra.  More than forty students are being penalised at present.
