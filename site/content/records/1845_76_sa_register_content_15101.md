Last Sunday the Wesleyans opened their new chapel at Westbury, a rising township adjoining Copperhouse.  Rev. Lloyd of Kooringa preached morning and evening.  W.H. Wilkinson Sen. preached in the afternoon.  There was a good congregation at each service, though inclement weather doubtless kept some away.  There were tea and public meetings the following day.
