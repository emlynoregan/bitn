Obituary.  Arthur Gaynor Owen-Smyth of Ulooloo Station, Hallett.

A.E. Bannear of Saddleworth recalls Captain Gaynor Owen-Smyth at Wayville in 1940, when as a training officer he welded the men for infantry and cavalry trained units into the reinforcement group of the 2/7th

He recalls his great sense of humour, his generosity with small loans to those in financial trouble and his ability to sort out the problems when his ‘boys’ ran into trouble with various authorities and he retells a couple of anecdotes about Owen-Smyth.
