Burra Town Council, 21 September

Fines on unpaid rates were forgiven a number of ratepayers.

A move to discount rates paid early by 2½% was defeated at the Local Government Assoc. meeting recently.

(Cr Jennison had supported the move and the Mayor had opposed it.)

The Mayor expressed surprise at the letter of Cr Button in the paper, as it dealt with matters that had not been discussed in Council.  The statement that Council income had shrunk by only £300 was partly correct.  [The figures in Woollacott’s letter on page 3 suggest the rate income had fallen £279.]

But in addition the Council subsidy fell £268, the Main Road Grant fell £200 and there was a carry-over debit from 1930 of £108.  [Woollacott’s letter puts the total drop in revenue as £582 or almost 20%, while the rate, grant and subsidy loss alone as stated above amounted to £647.]

The new Council he said had sold two horses reduced staff by two and called tenders for scavenging.  Electric lighting had been reduced and the Mayor’s allowance.

There was a recommendation from the Finance Committee to hand over arrears of rates to the solicitor for collection.

Cr Bevan thought it should have gone to the general Council first and when told it was entirely in the hands of the Town Clerk he wondered why the Finance Committee was making any recommendation at all.

The Mayor doubted the legality of remitting fines.

Cr Jennison took exception to Cr Bevan’s remarks as reflecting on the Finance Committee.

The employees’ wages were cut by 2/- a day.  (The alternative had been short time.)

No casual labour was to be employed before the end of November.
