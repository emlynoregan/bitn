On Tuesday 1 November there was a political meeting at Lamb’s Aberdeen Hotel.  There was a large attendance as it was believed two of the candidates for election would be there to reveal their views.  Mr Simpson was called to the chair and then Mr W. Dale explained that the object of the meeting was to form a branch of the SA Political Association.   He moved a motion: ‘That the meeting pledge themselves not to vote for any candidate who will not give a written pledge to vote against any of the funds of the colony being expended on immigration.’  Mr Tiver seconded.  Carried unanimously.  At the close of the meeting people were invited to come forward to join the Association and a number did so.  It was said a member from the Adelaide branch would attend another meeting to be called in a few weeks.
