Chris McCabe presented a cheque for $500 to the Library Board from the Auhls for the provision of research and then cut a ribbon across the stairs leading to the room.  Roger Henderson also spoke.  As immediate past principal of BCS he had been strongly committed to the development of the rooms during his time in Burra.  He presented the Board with two suitably inscribed photographs to go on the wall upstairs; one of Ian Auhl and the other of Colin Fidock.  School Council member Helen Stockman announced that the Education Department had advised that it would fund the position of Educational Officer for Burra from 1988.  Afternoon tea followed during which Colin Fidock cut a cake to mark the 9th birthday of the Community Library.
