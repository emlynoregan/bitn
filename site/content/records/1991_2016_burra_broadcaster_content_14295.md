Burra Art Gallery.  Stage II of the restoration has provided a further two rooms of hanging space.  Sam Hill-Smith performed the opening of the Russell Morrison exhibition.

St Mary’s Anglican Church celebrated the 150th anniversary of Anglicanism in Burra with a floral festival and display of embroidery and vestments.  The Dean of St Peter’s Cathedral preached the sermon on Sunday and a number of former parishioners returned for the special occasion.
