Accident/Obituary.  Norman Charles Thiele, ganger of Eudunda, was fatally injured at Hallett 15 May.  He was in charge of the Hallett Special Re-lay Gang.  He was involved in turning a 240 ft length of line when he was thrown and struck the permanent way, resulting in a fractured spine.  He was rushed to the Burra Hospital where Dr L. Miller pronounced him dead.  On a report to the coroner W. Phin JP by F-C B. Dowling of Hallett an inquest was deemed unnecessary.  Mr Thiele was 42 and is survived by a wife and two daughters.  He had been in charge of the Special Gang at Hallett since it was formed.  [Born Carl Norman Thiele 27 February 1914 Bower, SA.]
