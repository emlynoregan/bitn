Football

Hallett defeated Booborowie.  At three quarter time Hallett 3.5 led Booborowie 0.5.  Final scores are not given.  The description of the final quarter adds a goal to Hallett and a goal and a point to Booborowie, but then says Hallettâ€™s lead was 18 points, so perhaps Hallett scored another point as well.
