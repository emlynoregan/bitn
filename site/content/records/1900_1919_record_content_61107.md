Peace Day in Burra, last Saturday 19 July.

The Procession

Soon after 10.30 it departed Sara’s Corner.  Trooper Harry Brown led as flag-bearer followed by the Ladies’ band, then the returned men four abreast with Major T. Kenyon in command and led by Lieuts. R.A. Cock, K.C. Sandland & V.A. Riggs.  Then came the Oddfellows Lodges in regalia and miniature Red Cross Nurses.  A lorry then carried the young ladies of the Soldiers’ Aid Soc. They included Miss T. Bentley representing Peace with palm branches, Miss C. Bartholomaeus as Britannia and Miss Clarice Reed as Justice.  Other ladies and gentlemen represented the allies.  Reggie Pearce’s miniature buggy and girls with decorated umbrellas were next.  Then came the Foresters in regalia and the Boy Scouts.  J. Allen as John Bull led the Burra Band.  Scholars of Copperhouse School followed – the boys dressed as sailors and the girls as nurses or in white.  James Reed’s decorated car led the Burra School Fife & Drum Band.  Then came children from Hanson, Gum Creek, World’s End, Copperhouse, Leighton & Burra Schools carrying small flags.  The march went from Sara’s Corner to the Hospital and then turned and went direct to Victoria Park where each child was given a large bun and at noon they were given a luncheon bag and hot tea.

At 1 p.m. the children marched past to deposit offerings for the memorial fund, during which time the Ladies’ band played and the children were given a Peace Medal.  Sports followed at 2 p.m.

The Appeal was launched with speeches from Mr Hawkes and Mr Crewes, who said he believed £2,000 could be raised that day.  Mr Chambers then auctioned on the bugler system the King’s Proclamation of Peace inscribed by Mr George Hann.  There were pre-arranged promissory cards numbered in hundreds that took over the hour to read.  The highest bid of £115 came from W.I. Short.  Other substantial bids were: John Tennant & Family £110, T.H. Pearse & Sons £105, W.G. Hawkes & J.M. McBride each £100, Thomas Sandland £52-10-0 & J.H. Gallagher £50.  The total bids numbered about 500 and raised £1,140.

The sports results are then printed in just under 1 column.

Football: Kooringa 4.9 (33) defeated Aberdeen 3.7 (25)

The Soldiers’ Aid Soc. & Red Cross Ladies provided luncheon and afternoon tea.

A huge bonfire that could be seen for miles was lit at 7 p.m. and fireworks were let off.

Takings for all the day are estimated at £1,400.
