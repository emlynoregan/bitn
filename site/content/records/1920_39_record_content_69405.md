Obituary.  Max Pearce of Kooringa died on 26 December 1937.  He was seriously injured in the accident on 20 December when his passenger Mr J.L. Cleary was killed in a collision between his car and one driven by Mr Tom Warnes.  A fatal result for Mr Pearce’s injuries was not then anticipated.  Complications set in on 26 December and he died about three hours later.  He was the fifth and youngest son of Mr & Mrs C.J. Pearce of Kooringa and was born 16 January 1900.  He was educated at Burra Primary & High Schools before joining Elder, Smith & Co., rising from office boy to local manager in 1925.  He was acknowledged as one of the firm’s best country managers.  He was the hon. Treasurer of the Burra Institute and had held all the other offices there.  He was a member of the Burra Bowling Club and a golfer.  In August 1927 he married Miss Nell Herbert, second daughter of Mr & Mrs George Herbert of Kooringa who survives with two surviving daughters, Jill (9) & Judith (7).  Over 160 cars were drawn up for the funeral for the longest cortege seen in Burra.  500 people were already at the cemetery.  He is also survived by his parents and two brothers and four sisters: Lisle Pearce (Kooringa) & Andrew (Melbourne), Mrs P. Flint (Kingston), Miss Annie (Kooringa), Mrs E. Howath (Willunga) & Sister M.A. Pearce of Kent Town Private Hospital.  Two brothers, Courtney & Colin predeceased him.
