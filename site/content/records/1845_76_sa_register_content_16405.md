SA Railway.  Complaints have been made in the House of Assembly about delays on the Port Adelaide line.

[The writer says it is not hard to find the reason.  He goes through reports on the state of the locomotive power available.  No more than half the twelve engines that are supposed to be available were in a reliable state.  The workshops and machinery for repairs are inadequate.  The reasons for this state of affairs is said to be bad water, overwork and inadequate means of repair.]
