The Burra-Morgan Road will be closed for about seven months from 6 January 1997 for rebuilding and sealing work.  This is part of a $19 million upgrade, which when complete will see a sealed road from Morgan to Burra.  The terrain between Burra and the Robertstown turn-off prevents a by-pass road.  The road will re-open while the last section to ‘The Gums’ is completed.
