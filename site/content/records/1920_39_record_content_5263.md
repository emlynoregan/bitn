Local Board of Health

As no spread of diphtheria had occurred no further action re the closure of Burra School A Grade had been taken.

The Education Department said the school privies had been inspected in February and found to be satisfactory.  Earth boxes had been provided.

Dr Steele wrote on 15 August saying he considered the advice of the Board that the doctors settle the matter [relating to procedures to be followed in infectious diseases cases] between them, to be unfortunate in that it might seem to outsiders that a dispute existed between the doctors, which was not the case.  With respect to his question on swab examinations he had received no reply either to his letter of the 5 July or to that of 25 July.

[He was enquiring as to the standard the Board wished to use re declaring a sufferer free from infection: he suggested two successive negative results.  The Act does not specify this and so provides no guidance.]

The Board resolved that Dr Steele refer all cases of urgency to the Health Officer.
