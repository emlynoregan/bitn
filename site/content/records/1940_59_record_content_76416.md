Burra Burra DC, 4 February

It was resolved to give notice to borrow £15,000 to buy

2 Medium Patrol Graders

1 5-ton V-8 Ford Truck

1 Bulldozer Blade and fittings for the existing D4 Tractor.

Cr Wedding moved and Cr Radford seconded: ‘that [the] overseer be relieved of his position, but continue to be employed at his present rate, a temporary overseer (Mr Moreland) be placed in the position, and the position of overseer be advertised.’

Cr Lucas recorded his opposition to the motion as drafted, and advised he would be ashamed to vote for the motion.  It was lost on the casting vote of the Chairman.

Later Cr Wedding requested licence to resign as Councillor for Booborowie Ward.  Not granted.

[It is not clear from the report whether there was a relationship between the request and the motion above.]
