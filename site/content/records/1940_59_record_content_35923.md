Letters on Sunday Sport

Lotus Ireland (formerly of Burra) writes from Lindfield NSW.

As she now lives in Sydney she can say people there were amazed at the controversy over Sunday Sport, which had long been established there.  People from every walk of life found it amazing that the Council was considering banning Sunday tennis by law.

She is intensely proud of Burra and especially of its war effort and does not seek to condemn those opposed to Sunday sport, but thinks it a shame ‘that a few members of this small community should become warped in their minds, small in their outlook.  She thinks of all those who fought in the war, those who did not come back and those who languished as POWs.

‘What would they think of your petty school-boy squabbles.  They would scorn you, gentlemen, and likewise so do I.…Over here we play all sport on Sunday, child and adult alike.  We swim and surf, we sail and ride all on Sunday…The girls and boys on their playing fields, thank God for health and life itself.  They do not worship in church alone, their God is everywhere…In their minds there is no distorted pettiness, no festering evil, only a joyful thankfulness.’

P.J. Rule also writes as a foundation member of the Tennis Club.  The club was rightly or wrongly granted a 99 year lease at £1 per year.  It was an understanding that there would be no Sunday play, but nobody worried much about it as most of the then members were regular church and Sunday school folk.  The small minority didn’t bother about it.  As regards the City Council, Cr T.H. Woollacott has it all wrong.  Anybody can play on the parklands on Sundays, provided the games are not organised or rowdy.  Last year the City Council put its foot down regarding football games being played on the corner of South Terrace and Sir Lewis Cohen Avenue for the purpose of raising funds for Queen Competitions.  The crowd was blocking roadways and yelling their heads off.  Quiet games of tennis, gold and many other sports are in progress at all hours on Sundays without anything being said.
