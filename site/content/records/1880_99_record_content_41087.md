Representatives came from Davistown, Booborowie, Leighton, Stony Gap and Redruth.  The income for the quarter of £95-10-0 exceeded expenses by £25.  Senior circuit steward, John Dunstan Jun., has resigned as he leaves soon for Broken Hill.  The Superintendent submitted the financial statement of the parsonage property which had been purchased for £550 of which their minister, Rev. T.M. Rowe, had collected £287.  After business a farewell tea and social was given Rev. Rowe prior to his departure from the district [to Mt Barker.]
