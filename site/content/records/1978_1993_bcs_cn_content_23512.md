Burra Burra DC

Council will seek funding for further undergrounding of power lines in Burra.

Council intends to lease O’Connor’s Shed and the Burra Railway Station and will soon seek expressions of interest.

A Merino Capital Committee has been formed as a Section 199 Committee of Council to promote and develop the concept of Merino Capital of the World.

Council congratulates Shirley Madigan as Citizen of the Year and Caroline Bernhardt as Young Citizen of the Year.

Rebuilding of the Sports Complex was most worthy Community Event of the Year.

The Merino Capital of the World Committee is seeking photos, artefacts and memorabilia for displays promoting this concept.

Contact Andrew Butler, Dave Parnell or Darryl Venning.

Burra Traders second annual Aussie Breakfast was held on a perfect morning once a small amount of fog had dissipated.  Awards were presented to Caroline Bernhardt (Junior Citizen of the Year), Shirley Madigan (Senior Citizen of the Year) and the Burra Sports Complex – received by Paul Wilson (Community Event of the Year).

The 411th Cadet Unit provided an interesting flag raising ceremony.
