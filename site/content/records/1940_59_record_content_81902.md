Mrs M.A. Dawson of ‘Heather Brae’ Booborowie will be 90 on 2 July.  She has resided in the area since 1912 when she came from her birthplace at Finniss to take up a section of land formerly part of North Booborowie Station.  She is one of the few remaining original settlers of this station.  A party last Sunday was attended by her sons Jim, and Harry and daughters Violet, Janet, Grace and Kath and grandchildren Noeline and Kingsley.  Mrs Dawson enjoys good health.
