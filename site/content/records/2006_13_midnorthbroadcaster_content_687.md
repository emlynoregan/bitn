Editorial.  The editor considers that the decision of about 170 people at a public meeting in Burra that has caused the Regional Council to shelve plans to redevelop Market Square and Best Place represents a lost opportunity to update the townâ€™s centre.  Was it all for the cost of a surcharge on the rates of $43.50 p.a. for twenty years?  Or was it more due to an acute breakdown in communication between Council and ratepayers.
