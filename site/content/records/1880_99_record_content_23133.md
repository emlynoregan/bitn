Railways.  There was an article on using wood in locos, as the Government wanted it tried.  It worked only for locos with a deep flat firebox and of the timber available, logs 1’3” long worked best.  Sparks were a major problem and so without special chimneys it was out of the question in summer.  Apart from crops etc. several railway wagons were set alight from sparks.

On the 5’3” gauge the cost was:	for coal 2.868d per train mile

for wood 5.926d per train mile

On the 3’6” gauge the cost was:	for coal 3.181d per train mile

for wood 6.11d per train mile

(In the last case 9.25% coal had to be used to maintain sufficient steam.)
