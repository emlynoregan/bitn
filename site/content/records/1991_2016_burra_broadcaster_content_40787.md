St Mary’s Church Organ

The 110-year-old Dodd pipe organ at St Mary’s requires a major overhaul.  The target to pay for this is $10,000, with some donations in hand.  The organ was installed in 1905 at a cost of £350.  It took three months to be built by J.E. Dodd of Adelaide.  Dr E. Harold Davies was the guest organist at its dedication on 22 December 1905.  The organ was enlarged in 1964 and further work was done on it in 1971.  It is a treasure for the church and part of the town and state’s heritage.

Rosemary Nairn OAM, a former Burra resident is heading a group raising funds and on 14 June will conduct the Brougham Place Uniting Church Choir at the 10 a.m. service and at 2 p.m. for a fundraising concert.  Admission $10.  Another pre-restoration concert is planned for 16 August and a post-restoration one in November.  [Photo.]
