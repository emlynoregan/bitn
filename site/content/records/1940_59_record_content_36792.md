Burra Primary and High Schools.  Experts from the Architect-in-Chief’s Department have inspected the yards and conveniences of both schools and have recommended:

The purchase of one chain of land on the eastern and western sides of the schoolyards for the installation of a large septic tank system, with an overflow to the bank of the creek and collecting also from a septic system to be installed for the headmaster’s residence.

A large army hut will be erected for technical classes – possibly behind the High School.

A portion of the yard will be paved.
