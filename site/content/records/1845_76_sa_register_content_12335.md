Wright Bros. & Mr Dixon have given a series of entertainments here comprising musical pieces, singing, conjuring tricks, gymnastic feats, phantasmagorical and dissolving views, chromotropes etc.  On Tuesday evening they also provided the music for a ball.

[Chromotropes were two brilliantly coloured circular magic lantern slides, one superimposed on the other and able to be rotated to give brilliant patterns; also known as chromatropes or Chinese lights.]
