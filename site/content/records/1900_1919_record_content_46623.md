Visit of 43rd Battalion Band.

The Band arrived by the midday train on Saturday and they were entertained in the afternoon by Burra Cheer-up Society.  In the evening they played at the Theatregraph Pictures and Mr Lester donated £5.  In their stay £112-17-10 was raised for 43rd Battalion Trench Comforts and Relief Committee.

The Burra Cheer-up Society entertainment is reported in ½ column and the Society reports the receipt of photos of Bugler Jennison, Pte Speckman [sic, for Spackman], Pte Steadman & Sgt J. Murison.

At Aberdeen the band gave a sacred concert on Sunday afternoon.

The report then spends c. ½ column outlining the sort of cases that are dealt with from the Battalion Fund.

In the evening Chaplain Capt. Cuttriss gave an address at the Kooringa Methodist Church on ‘The Mystery of Suffering’, which receives another ½ column.

After this the band played in Market Square where the Captain gave another address.

On Monday there was a concert at the hospital.  Unfortunately Pte Waters, 1st cornettist, went for a ride and his horse fell, breaking Pte Waters’ collarbone.  In the evening there was a concert in the Institute, which is reviewed in some detail with names of performers etc. in c. ⅓ column.
