Obituary.  Mr Kinso C.H. Ewins died in Adelaide on Thursday evening.  He left Burra about 30 years ago, but visits to his parents and subsequently to his brother maintained his contacts with the town.  He was the second son of the late Mr & Mrs C.H. Ewins of Kooringa.  And was born in England in 1876 and came to SA with his parents in 1882.  He was educated at Burra Public School after which he entered the Record office to learn his trade.  Later he went to the Times at Peterborough and about 25 years ago to the Advertiser in Adelaide where at the time of his death he was assistant supervisor in the composing department.  When young he was a member of St Mary’s Choir and later sang for St Augustine’s Choir at Unley.  He was an enthusiastic shooter and a member of the Advertiser Rifle Club.  He was also worshipful Master of the Commercial Lodge (Freemasons) and a member of St Peter’s Mark Lodge.  He was a promoter of the Burra reunions held annually in the Botanic Gardens in Adelaide and a mover of the Back to Burra celebrations in 1926.  His early death at 53 followed an operation for appendicitis.  In 1901 he married Miss Floris A. Coxell of Adelaide who survives with a daughter Mrs Frank T. Marston of Eudunda.  There is one grandson.  Will J.C. Ewins of Kooringa is a brother.  [Kinso Charles Henry Ewins died 23 August 1929 in Adelaide, residence Wayville.]
