Obituary & Inquest.  An Aboriginal named Jimmy Wonga died at Burra Hospital as a result of burns received near Yatina.  He deposed while dying that he had got drunk on brandy and had fallen into a fire without noticing it and on Sunday he couldn’t walk.  He additionally deposed that Mr James of Mannanarie had given him one bottle of rum and Forrest a bottle of brandy at the same time and place.

Dr John I. Sangster said both legs were badly burned - the left from foot to thigh and the right to the knee.  Bone was exposed and both legs were in a state of mortification.

The inquest details extend over 2 columns.

Thomas James and David Forrest denied supplying liquor.

Verdict was death from burns received through falling into a fire while in a state of intoxication and ‘that from the evidence given every attention was paid to the deceased by Mr J.B. Carr JP and P-C Ormsby, and the telegrams which appeared in the Advertiser were absolutely false.

[The registration of death says: Jemmy Wonga, died 27 June, aged 45, but the documents related to the cemetery records say burial was on 24 June!]
