Burra Town Council, 5 April.

Cr Alexander Harris was welcomed as the newly elected member in place of T. Kitchen.

Cr Parks asked if the Mayor had reconsidered his position on his notice of motion.

The Mayor said his position was unchanged.

Cr Parks moved the suspension of standing orders, for the purpose of dealing with pay sheets and accounts.  After a little disputation this was carried.

When that business was done Cr Linkson moved for a call of Council to be made at a meeting to be held on 17 April with a view to the excision of the Mayor’s Report from the meeting of 16 January.

The Mayor ruled him out of order.

Cr Parks moved the adjournment till 17 April.

Crs Linkson, West, Walsh and Rabbich* voted for.

Crs Harris and Hardy opposed.

[* This obvious error was corrected in the next issue to Cr Parks.]
