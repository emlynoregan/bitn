Mongolata Goldfield

Reprint of an article from Smith’s Weekly

Mongolata Goldfield in SA has triumphed despite the withholding of Government assistance in its early development.  It is now returning shareholders handsome dividends.  All it asks now is for the Federal Government to establish a Post Office and telephone exchange.

The discovery was made by Harry Byles who went prospecting when his boss I.J. Warnes, a prominent pastoralist, no longer required his services.  Today Mr Warnes is a director of the company formed as a result of his boundary rider’s discovery.

Mongolata is 116 miles from Adelaide.  It was first developed by a syndicate that issued 50 £10 shares.  Then it was decided to float Byles’ Mongolata Gold Mining Co. (NL) when production had reached the stage that it was able to pay a £4-17-6 bonus on each syndicate share, in addition to which 150 fully paid £1 shares were given to every holder of a syndicate share.  About this time Bill Pexton a former South African and now a well-known horse owner had a 30cwt truck and five sons anxious for work.  When his offer to cart the ore to Peterborough was rejected by the company he pegged out his own claim and as a result thousands of pounds worth of gold has been taken from the claim.  In a safe deposit vault in Adelaide reposes one of his nuggets weighing 185oz, estimated to contain 130oz of gold.  The whole area of Mongolata has already been pegged out and £19,000 worth of ore went through the Government battery last year.

From Byles’ discovery claim 1,166 tons 11cwt were put through and the total yield of the field was 3,569oz of which Byles’ claim put through 1,894oz.  Total value without the gold premium was £14,184.  Since Byles’ GM was formed over £14,000 has been returned to the company.  During the control of the syndicate total gold production was 467oz from 79 tons.  The syndicate spent £1,000 in wages and since the formation of the company £5,929 has been paid in wages, not including salaries.  Twenty-seven miners are employed by the Mongolata Co. while 110 are at work on the field.  The company’s wages bill is £200 a fortnight and last March it paid a 6d dividend with a similar payment expected in June.  The gold averages 22 carat bringing about 5/- more per ounce than the standard gold.  The gold from Baldina Mine on the same field shows the highest value gold in the world according to a Government expert.  The directors George Milne, Archie Thornton, Doug Reid, Isaac Warnes and James Daly are all well known South Australians.
