The Mayor’s Report.

The year opened with a debt of £8-10-5.  At present there is a credit of £63-12-7, most of which will be expended by the end of the year.

The assessment gave a rateable value a little lower than for 1897 and the general rate was reduced from 11d to 9d.

The assessment for 1899 is £87 less than for 1898 at £8,548.

In 1898 the North Ward lamp cost £5-15-6 and the lamps in the other two wards cost £4-17-6 each.

The Town Clerk was paid £45-16-8 and the Inspector £33-6-8.

The big items of expenditure were:

North Ward: Tregony St £43-16-6 and Sancreed St £21-18-11.

East Ward: new footbridge near the Bible Christian Church £50-12-0.

West Ward: Chapel St £21-5-7.

The Waterworks is a major headache with the dry year creating strains on the supply and only by great care have major problems and mishaps been avoided.  The lease runs out this year and in April the Government was asked how much they would sell the works for and on the 22 June they replied £8,072-14-7, or they would lease the works on the same terms as now, i.e. 5% on £8,072-14-7.

On 8 September a strong deputation went to the Commissioner of Public Works and asked for a reduction in the interest rate to 4% and in the capital to £6,000.  The Government only replied on 4 November and that was to offer 4% on £8,072-14-7.  The Council does not feel justified in accepting this and so will submit the question to ratepayers.

Health.  The sanitary condition of the town is good.  There was some typhoid this year, but most cases in the hospital came from elsewhere.

The Council worked with good will and the work of Mr W. Davey as Town Clerk is highly appreciated.

J. Sampson, Mayor.
