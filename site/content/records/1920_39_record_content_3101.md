After some years of considering improvements tenders were called early in 1920 for the plans submitted by Messrs Bruce & Harral and on 30 June 1920 the tender of Jos. King & Son of Adelaide was accepted for the sum of £1,199, financed by a £1,500 mortgage on the property.  Messrs James Marshall & Co. of Adelaide supplied the seating for the portion under the gallery and in the gallery itself with tip-up theatre chairs upholstered in leather in the gallery and folding blackwood chairs below.  D. Jones & Son are doing the redecorating.  The lighting plant has worked out at 7d per night running cost, which proves it was the right decision.
