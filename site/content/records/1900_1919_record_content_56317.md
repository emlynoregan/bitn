Fourth Anniversary of the War: Intercession Service.

This was held last Sunday at the Institute.  The hall was packed and people stood outside and many went away.  The Institute Choral Class of 60-70 sang, with Miss Trix Pearce at the organ and Miss Amy Harris at the piano.  Rev. A. J. Finch gave a prayer and Captain Trigg of the Salvation Army gave a scripture reading.  Rev. H. Hopton of St Mary’s gave a thoughtful address on ‘Loyalty’.  Rev. D.B. Bridgwood then spoke on Intercession.  The Mayor Mr Crewes and Mr Hawkes also spoke.
