Letter.  Brenda Taplin writes as secretary of the Burra Town Hall Committee re their plans over the next few months.  June to August inclusive will not be available for hire because of the refurbishment of the hall.  The partition wall in the foyer will be moved back into the main hall to make the foyer a more useful space.  It will also tidy up the main hall by blocking off the area under the stairs from the hall space.  A history room will be set off to show social history of Burra.  A grand-re-opening occasion will be organised.  The display of historical pictures in the supper room will remain.
