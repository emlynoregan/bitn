Girl Guides held their AGM in the CWA Room on 10 August.  President Mrs J. Barker presided.  The Girl Guide Association thanks Mr L. Phelan for use of his sample room to store collected waste and the Burra Council for carting it to the station.

Owing to the resignation of Mrs Cliff Lott as Guide Captain and Miss Frances Dollman as leader of the Brownies both groups have had to go into recess until a suitable leader is found.  Elected were President, Mrs John Barker; Vice-Presidents, Matron Robinson & Mrs D.M. Steele; Secretary Mrs R. Jeffery & Treasurer, Mrs G. Dollman.
