The Elections were a great Liberal victory.

Mr Peake wins office.  Locally (Burra District) the three Liberals were way out in front:

Miller	6230

O’Loughlin	6114

Homburg	5968

Newland	4474

Callary	3841

Legislative Council counting continues, but for the Northern Division so far:

Bice	5194

Goode	3054

Lewis	4926

This makes it apparent that the old [Liberal] team will be returned.

[The whole report is very pro-Liberal.]
