Rex Ingamells, a former Burra boy, is having a novel Of Us Now Living published.  He lived in Burra as a boy and attended Burra Primary School when his father, Rev. E.M. Ingamells, was in charge of Redruth Methodist Church some 25 years ago.  Under a 1949 Commonwealth Literary Fund Scholarship he was called on to write an epic poem and a novel.  He was born at Orroroo in 1913 and after time in Burra the family moved to Pt Lincoln.  He has since been a freelance journalist, a SA schoolteacher and a traveller for a Melbourne publisher.
