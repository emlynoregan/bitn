Weather.  Last Sunday showers and hail fell and on Sunday night it snowed.  The hills and gullies were covered on Monday morning, though it had melted by about 8 a.m.  A fall this late in the year is unusual.  Snow persisted all day on the higher ground towards Mt Bryan and Hallett.  Monday continued wet and cold.
