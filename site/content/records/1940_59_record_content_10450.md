Mrs Baker, mother of Mrs George Melrose of Willogoleche Station, celebrated her 80th birthday on 8 June.  She was born in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1857.  Hers was the first marriage ceremony performed in a Presbyterian Church in Edinburgh.  She observed Queen Victoria’s Golden and Diamond Jubilee Celebrations and was present at Buckingham Palace for the marriage of Queen Mary and the late King George V.  After the 1914-18 war she and her late husband came to Australia to reside with her daughter.  She has been her daughter’s assistant in many social, church and patriotic interests and is a most energetic worker.  She still works in the garden she loves and regularly attends the Hallett Church of England.
