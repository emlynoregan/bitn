There was no larrikinism on New Year’s Eve: not even a gun or whistles.

Special church services for New Year were conducted by:

Rev. R.M. Hunter at Kooringa Wesleyan Church

Rev. Daddow at Redruth Primitive Methodist Church

Rev. Father O’Dowling at St Joseph’s

Mt Bryan Bible Christian Sunday School held its Anniversary service on 25 December conducted by Rev. J. Hopkins (Wesleyan).

A Concert in aid of the Wesleyan Sunday school was held at the Lecture Hall on 27 December.  Among a host of performers Mr J. Roach entertained the audience with a sermon on the text ‘Old Mother Hubbard’, which was a satire on preachers who make a text of scripture mean anything they fancy. (It was the performance of a piece written by a Presbyterian minister.)

Proceeds were satisfactory.
