Burra High School break-up celebrations were held at the Burra Institute on 17 December.  Dr Steele as President of the High School Council presided.  Students provided a program of entertainment.  The Headmaster reported an average attendance of nearly 50; just lower than in 1929.  Mo changes of staff occurred during the year, but now Miss Batchelor has been transferred to Unley High School and Miss Jones to Woodville High School.

Last year four Intermediate Certificates and one Leaving Certificate were gained and this week we have learned that Beryl Lawson has just passed Leaving Honours in English Literature, Modern History and Latin.

Sporting success this year has been good against Clare and the School Magazine has produced some fine original work.

Dr Steele had hardly started his address when called away by urgent professional business.

The Mayor took over and made the presentation of awards, the list of which is presented from which the following have been selected:

First Year Dux was Bernice Potter.

Greatest progress among Intermediate Girls: Edna Allen.

Greatest progress among Leaving Girls: Mollie Walker.

Dux of the School: Beryl Lawson.

Most Industrious Student: Eric Seeley.

Best Intermediate Results: 1929: May Buff.

Best Exam Results 1929: Beryl Lawson.

Best Woodwork Theory & Practice: Clarrie Fuss.

[Personal interest: Domestic Arts Certificate Grade II: Edna Allen (& others).]

Presentations were made to the teachers who were leaving.

Miss Jones has been seriously ill and her presentation was accepted by her mother who was visiting.

The second portion of the program opened with the Grande Valse Brilliant played by Joffre Hill & Clarrie Fuss.  This was followed by a farce and then three scenes from Dickens’ A Christmas Carol, in which Clarrie Fuss played Scrooge’s nephew.  Laurie Hann was Scrooge and Laurie Twist played Cratchett.
