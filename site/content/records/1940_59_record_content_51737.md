Kangaroo St Bridge.  On Tuesday night last week part of the bridge collapsed after the passage of a truck loaded with 25 tons on cement.  Several people had lucky escapes, including Richard Tiver who almost rode his bike into the hole.  The road was quickly barricaded and repairs are going to prove expensive.
