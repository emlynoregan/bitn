Cr Sampson moved to have information laid against Sara & Dunstan for destroying kerbing in front of the new Elder, Smith & Co. offices and for having verandah posts obstructing the footpath.  Not 2nd.

Cr Sampson then called attention to the contractors having promised to restore the footpath in front of the same offices and it had not been done.

Cr Watt told him to wait until the work was finished.

Cr Sampson’s next motion to instruct the contractors to make the footpath good was not 2nd.

He then tried to make an issue of the contractors leaving rubbish and timber in the watertable, but this also failed to get support.

Cr Sampson then turned to Bagot, Shakes & Lewis’s failure to remove the obstruction from the watercourse.  The Council had authority to do the work and charge the company for it.  Not 2nd.

He moved then that the Mayor interview Mr Lewis as soon as possible with reference to the matter.  Carried.
