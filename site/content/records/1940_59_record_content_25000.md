Mr Arthur Coverdale wrote to the Council accusing it of imposing unnecessary hardship on dogs kept in its pound and citing a specific case.  The overseer denied this and responded with details.

Mr F. Gunthorpe wrote to the Council complaining of the disturbance caused by stray cats.

Pickett Monument.  Some time ago a suggestion was made to establish a monument to John Pickett ‘the founder of Burra’.  One gentleman offered £10, the Town Council £1-1-0 and the Burra Burra DC £5.  All then hung fire due to the many appeals for funds, but on Monday the Town Council decided to proceed with a subscription list and offered to donate £20.  The total cost is expected to be about £50.
