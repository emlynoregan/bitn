‘Residents of Hanson’ write claiming they thought the house described by Mrs Dixon in her letter of 12 September belonged to R.A. Carpenter and adding that ‘the ladies and gentlemen have proved themselves to be so.  This of course, is more than can be said of everyone who takes up residence in this district.’
