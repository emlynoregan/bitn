Father John Devenport was born in England and educated at various schools in northwest Kent.  After a two-year stint in the RAF he came to Australia and was employed with the Research & Development Branch of the Department of Mines (later to become AMDEL).  At this time he began a degree course in Chemical Technology.  His wife Barbara was also born in England and received most of her education there before coming to Adelaide.  The couple were married at St Margaret’s Church, Woodville and have two children.  Paul, the elder, is married with a small son.  He is frequently heard on ABC Radio.  Catherine is also married with two sons.  While John was studying his Chemistry course, Barbara took a two year course in Theology and was awarded the TH.A. with first class honours.
