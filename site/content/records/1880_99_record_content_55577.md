Editorial on the Inspector fiasco.

The replacement of Mr J.R. Gray by Mr J. Snell created so much protest from the ratepayers that the Councillors were forced to retract their decision.  A special Council meeting was called on Friday night to achieve this.  They offered Mr Gray his old position at £50, but he refused.  Had his application been fairly considered initially he would have accepted £50, but now he would accept only at £60.  The Councillors agreed.  So through this blunder the Council has lost another £10 p.a.  We don’t condemn the reinstatement of Mr Gray, but the way the Council is transacting business is unsatisfactory.  The ratepayers have no alternative but to call a public meeting to compel an account of their conduct to be given, after which the Councillors should resign at once and allow gentlemen to fill their places who will act in a straightforward manner.  The reinstatement of the Inspector is not the only issue here and is insufficient to do away with the need of a special public meeting.
