‘From the organ of the aggrieved operatives.’  Burra Burra Mines 16 September.

For some time past the miners have felt themselves aggrieved.  Wages have been reduced, although the price of scrip has in three years advanced from £5 to £300 and a seventh dividend is about to load the pockets of shareholders, so that there is no ostensible reason for this depreciation of labour.  The miners have always quietly submitted to the subtraction of 1/6 a week from their pittance to pay for the Club and Doctor, while the latter regularly makes an extra charge for treating their families.  About 700 or more work at the mine, generally healthy and robust and so rarely needing the doctor and each paying 6d for nothing, to the tune of £17-£20 per week or £884-£1040 per annum, besides extra charges for deliveries and family treatment.  Surely the position of Mine Doctor is a sinecure.

The returns from the Mine Assay Office have, particularly of late, been very far from satisfactory.  This is not the complaint of one man, but a general and increasing malady.  Attempts by individuals to have this injustice addressed have been met only with puffs and sneers.  At length the pimple grew into a scab and finally burst with a memorial to the Directors on 12 August:

‘Gentlemen – We, the undersigned, your humble petitioners (as the one voice of all the Tributers on your Mine), considering that many of the samples which have lately come up from Adelaide have been undervalued (from what cause we know not), respectfully request that all samples which have been recently, or may in future, be tested or assayed, be sealed with the Burra stamp and then be sent direct from the office at the Mine to a practical assayer with fixed numbers instead of names, and the assayer to remit the ticket, expressing the value of the ore, with his name annexed, to the general Superintendent at the Mine.  Also, that there be a re-trial of all samples differing more than one (1) per cent. on the product from our private samples: all differences of (1) one per cent. to be divided.

(Here follow the signatures of all the tributors on the Mine.)’

From the above date to last Thursday 14 September no reply had been received to this petition and the petitioners patiently awaited the arrival of a deputation from the Board of Directors.  At length on Wednesday a group of Directors arrived and on Thursday a meeting of miners was held to deliberate on the proper way go to work.  A number of miners spoke and the position was expounded.  A Committee was appointed to transact their affairs.

As a preliminary step a deputation was to meet the Directors and apply for redress of grievances.  It was agreed that in the case of a refusal a general strike of the miners would take place from that moment.

The Committee pleaded and protested in vain.

On Friday another meeting resolved to prevent any straggling dissenter from continuing to work before perfect redress had been obtained.  As a result eight were arrested in the act of going to work.  Of them six immediately agreed to desist.  The other two proved refractory and were hauled up to grass and pinioned down to a hand-barrow.  This was then raised to the shoulders of four sturdy men who then carried them in procession around the mine and town followed by the whole body of miners.  They were accompanied by vociferous ‘Hurrahs’ and exposed to the ridicule of about 1,800 laughing people.  Then the eight were compelled to carry the vehicle of conveyance back to the Mine.  All this was accomplished in good humour with no quarrelling or rioting.

The Mines are presently all quiet.

Repeated attempts were made in vain to parley with the Directors.

An anonymous letter from the Miners, drafted on the 15th and delivered on 16 September was verbally rejected because it was anonymous.  After that a letter with eight signatures was sent.

The reply was that if all the men return to work the Directors would hearken to the complaints of one or two uncombined men who might come to them.

On Thursday Corporal Brooks was sent with a special warrant to apprehend two men.  When he seized one of them a number of fellows said that if he took that man he had to take them also.  He said that as he could not take them all, he would take no one.  When he reported to the Directors, they said they were perfectly satisfied.
