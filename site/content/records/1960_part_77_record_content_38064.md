Burra Mine.  Drilling operations continue.

About 70 holes have been put down, some to 300 ft and samples are being analysed and the results checked with small shafts to about 50 ft, ten of which are to be sunk over ten of the 70 drill holes.  Each will yield about 40 tons of material for checking at the Cobar facilities.  It is hoped to complete one shaft each week.  Bill Wiseman from Adelaide is in charge assisted by Supervisors Mr M. Corradini & Mr J. Boyce of Broken Hill.
