The Jubilee Train visited Burra on Saturday and Sunday and long queues of people waited to enter it.  About 1,000 saw through on Saturday and 800 on Sunday.  There was more to see than time or the crowds allowed.  There were displays from the following Government Departments:

RAN	Army	RAAF

Immigration	National Gallery	Education

Public Library	Public Health	SA Harbours Board

SA Police	Architect-in-Chief	SAR

Lands, Woods & Forests	Agriculture	E & WS

ETSA	Highways & Local Government	Mines, Fisheries & Game

The Mayor, Mr W. Carpenter, and G.S. Hawker MP spoke before the Mayor declared the exhibition open.  Train personnel were entertained by the Mayor for dinner at the RSL Rooms.  The CWA ladies supplied a splendid meal.  On Sunday morning five cars were organised to show the train personnel around the town.

[The Mayor’s speech indicates some of the worries of the time.  It touched on inflation and the Communist threat to the Australian way of life.

‘Australians could have anything they wanted if only they’d work.  In this respect there was too much sport in the middle of the week.’

He mentioned as famous men of the town: Sir Frederick Holder (first Speaker of the House of Representatives,) Hon. P.A. McBride (presently Minister of Defence) and Essington Lewis.
