Mr Lewis tried to avoid paying a fine for driving around Best Place corner at over 4 m.p.h. by pleading that without a town survey and a town plan lodged there were in fact no town streets.  The bench held that the Corporation Act considered all thoroughfares to be streets and fined him 10/- + 42/- expenses.
