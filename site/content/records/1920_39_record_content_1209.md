Bass Relief Fund is £237-14-7.  The committee has purchased a house in Bridge St for Mrs Bass for £150.  The property is vested in five trustees: S.M. Lane, G. Lawn, E.J. Harris, A.L. Walker & J.E.H. Winnall.  The family will have use of the property for Mrs Bass’s lifetime or until the youngest child is 21, after which the trustees will have the power to dispose of it and apply the proceeds to the relief of distress in the district.  The committee is anxious to finalise the fund and calls for all promised subscriptions.
