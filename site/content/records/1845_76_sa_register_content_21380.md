Central Road Board

Appropriations for the North District

Building Bridge over Freshwater Creek, Hamilton	£800

Making the worst parts of the Springfield-Hamilton Road	£500

Making the worst parts of the Black Springs-Springfield Road	£2,000

Mr Bright said the Saddleworth-Black Springs road had been on the schedule for years and not a shilling had been spent on it.  That was not fair to the locality.

Mr Everard knew of no road which appeared to be as dangerous as the one referred to and wondered why Mr Macaulay had not made any appropriation for it.

Mr Macaulay said it was a long road and there was so little money that could have been put towards it.

[Changes to the appropriations were deemed impossible at this stage, as it would mean going back to the surveyors and adjusting many allocations, for which there would not be time before Parliament rose.]
