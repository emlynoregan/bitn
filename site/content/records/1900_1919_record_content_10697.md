Burra Town Council

The Railway Commissioner does not think a lamp is needed at the station gate.  In fact he thinks that the station road should be closed and that access to the station should be via the parallel Council road.

[This of course would transfer cost to the Council and they were reluctant to agree to it for this reason as well as because the difference in height created access problems requiring further expenditure as well as ongoing maintenance costs.  Eventually the answer was to be a one-way road with entry via the Council road and exit via the SAR road.  The Council road referred to is Railway Terrace.  The SAR road is now closed.]
