Burra Hospital Title

The Group of Concerned Burra & District residents have claimed victory over the transfer of the title from the Burra Burra Hospital Inc. to the Lower North Health Advisory Council retaining the existing schedule of endorsements to read ‘In trust to permit suffer and to be used at all times as a Hospital reserve over allotment 94 and the land marked X.’

Spokesperson Helen Szuty said that the decision will better protect the retention of Burra Hospital in the future as a public hospital.

E.B. Hawke writes expressing great disappointment that the ramp he made for disabled access to the Burra Regional Art Gallery was purloined by a wayward child as a jump ramp for his skateboard.
