Friday 30 March. United Friendly Societies' Picnic in Austin's Paddock was held in excellent weather and recent rains left it free of dust, but dry underfoot. Attendance was only about 600 due in part to the distance from town and in part to some people's objections to such activity on Good Friday. The Burra Brass Band led a procession of the societies from the Institute at 10.00am, but disappointingly few attended - only 28 with a few more only as they passed Redruth and Aberdeen.
