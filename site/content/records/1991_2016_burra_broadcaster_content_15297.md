Burra Guides had a great year in 1997.

The highlight for Junior Guides was a Pack Holiday at Marineland, Adelaide.  Seven of the eight juniors attended, with two leaders.

The Guides had two camps early in the year – one was in Adelaide and the second at McLaren Vale Girl Guide property of ‘Douglas Scrub’.  [Other of the year’s activities are listed.]
