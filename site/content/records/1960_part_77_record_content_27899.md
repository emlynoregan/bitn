Swimming.  In the triangular contest between Burra, Clare and Spalding, Burra and Clare tied in the first meet, but Spalding established a lead of almost 80 points at the second meet and consequently it is unlikely Spalding can be overtaken in the third contest at Clare on Friday.  Spalding will therefore hold the shield for the next twelve months.
