Letter from Robert Brummitt.

He considers the Council’s attitude to the Hydraulic Engineer needlessly pugnacious.

On the point about the land title he says the entire shaft is on a road belonging to the Corporation.  The Waterworks proposed to erect a shed and fence a small yard, say 15 or 20’ in the width of the road.  The Waterworks Committee proposed to take the steps to close the section of road, but were advised that as there was no likelihood of successful opposition it would be cheaper to wait till some other roads required similar treatment - as one now does.  When it was proposed to acquire some land from the YPMA for an enclosure for wood, the engineer, Mr Jobson, advised it would be likely to be quicker and cheaper to do so in some way other than through the Government.  The yard is desirable if not too expensive, but as the Council decided to go through the Government delay is a matter of course.

The absence of a shed is not surprising as the plan was to erect the engine and build a shed over it - the engine has not yet arrived.

When the engine was ordered the mains were to be 1¾ miles long - now they are 7½ miles.  The engine and pump ordered will lift 2,400 gallons per hour, but the engine will work two pumps if a second be got from England.  The Hydraulic Engineer agreed to leave the present pump in position as well as the new one until demands are ascertained.  That seemed reasonable to the committee last year - being assured that with the extra pump the engine will raise 4,800 gallons per hour.  What Cr West calls ‘pepper’ will not be likely to improve the relations of the Council with the Waterworks Department.
