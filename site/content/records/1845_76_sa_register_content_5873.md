MINING IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA from the London Mining Journal

[The writer begins with a description of Port Wakefield and the sale of land there and then moves on to the sale of agricultural land and then the mineral lands of Emu Flats.  These are all points noted already, as they occurred.  He does add a couple of interesting points:

Discoverers of minerals went to extraordinary lengths to hide their discoveries so that there would be no extra bidders forcing up the price of the land when it was auctioned.  Sometimes green rocks were painted over, or a flock of sheep were camped on the site, or a hut could even be erected over the discovery.]
