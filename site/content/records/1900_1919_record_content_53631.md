Local Board of Health

The agreement between the Hospital Board and the Local Board of Health has been passed to the former for signature.

Cr Killicoat gave notice he would require the Town Clerk to explain his evidence at the Hospital enquiry, claiming the delay to signature was partly the fault of the Burra Board of Health and partly the Burra Hospitalâ€™s.
