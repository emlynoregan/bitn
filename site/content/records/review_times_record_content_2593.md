Burra Kindergarten children have a new playground environment to enjoy thanks to the hard work of Mr Barry Bull.  He is the husband of the Director, Julie Bull, and together they drew up plans to improve the outdoor play facilities after the Management Committee decided to expand the play area.  The new area includes a pine lookout and platform.
