James Alfred Glasson sued Nelson for assault.  Both were cab drivers and Nelson (Working for T.P. Halls) tried to take a portmanteau from Glasson and so gain a passenger at the Burra Railway Station, then grabbed him by the neck and threw him down.  Nelson took 14 days jail rather than pay the £2-9-1 fine and costs.
