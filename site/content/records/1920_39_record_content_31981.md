Burra Show 1929

The show was held last Friday & Saturday.  His Excellency Sir A. Hore Ruthven visited on the Saturday.  Friday’s weather was good and Saturday was close and dusty without interfering with the program.  Despite the influenza epidemic the show was a great success.  Mrs Rowe handled the catering excellently.

Agricultural produce had a good display despite its being a dry year.

Dairy produce was well presented again, especially the nearly 40 exhibits staged by Mr & Mrs E. Finch of ‘Wandillah’ near Burra.

Poultry entries were down, but quality predominated.

Pigeon entries were up and though Burbidge Bros. had pride of place, local enthusiasts were well represented.

Draught horses have fallen off with the introduction of tractors, but there were some excellent entries.

Horses in action drew many entries as usual.

Cattle were in low numbers, but good in quality.

On the whole the judges were not impressed with the dog entries.

Sheep showed a further increase and the quality did not reflect the harsh conditions of the year.

Fleece wool exhibits took the whole length of the building and were of an excellent character.

Pigs were few in number.

Implements and cars were well represented and of great interest.

Vegetables were down due to the season, but of good quality.  B. Opperman & W. Moxham dominated the prizes.

Fruit as usual was poorly represented.  Clare exhibitors were absent and instead D. & E. Armstrong of Waikerie did well in apples and oranges, though Mrs H. Swift from P. & A. McBride’s ‘Wooltana’ Station beat them for lemons.

Flowers were fair considering the dust storms, late season and high winds.

Cookery was of a high standard.

Fancy Work was very good and Miss Bentley did particularly well.

Photography & Art were fairly well represented.

School Class work was better displayed than ever and there were many entries from the district schools as well as Burra.

[Personal interest: R. Fuss is listed as a judge in Flowers, but apparently was not an exhibitor, as he does not appear among the prize winners.]
