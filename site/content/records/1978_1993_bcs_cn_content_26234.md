Kevin Fahey, Principal of BCS writes that he has been proud to have been associated with the Burra School & Community News and praises the dedication of the editors, typists, proofreaders, contributors, payout people, collators and distributors.  He thanks all community members who have contributed to its success over the past sixteen years.  He says a new avenue of communication will be developed and one such is the School’s Radio Station, which was granted a ‘narrow class licence’ the previous week.
