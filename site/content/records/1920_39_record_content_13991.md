Letter from ‘H. K.’ who continues the debate on Sunday sport.  This is a long letter full of Biblical references to Genesis and the creation story and then other references, but ending with the conviction that the only day to keep holy is Saturday and therefore that should be observed, but ‘There is no statement in the Bible that says that Sunday should be kept holy.’
