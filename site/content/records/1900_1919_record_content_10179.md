[Other improvements to the paper are also promised on page 3.  The editorial in the next issue had more to say on this.  Essentially the changes introduced more local news, more snippets of information on local personalities both present and past and a greater attention to detail.  There was also an increase in items of general interest, home and farming hints as well as humour.  The length of the notes for the rest of the year is some indicator of the scope of this change.]
