Burra Burra DC

Julie Brandt has been appointed junior assistant at the office.

100 new chairs will arrive at the Town Hall early in 1977.

A new fence will be placed around the playing area and the parking areas are being levelled [at the town oval].

The two cricket clubs and the football club will contribute towards the cost.

Kerbing work has been done in Queen Street.

Mr Vic. Elliott of Burra North will build a stone barrier at the car park opposite the Town Hall.  The foundations have been laid and the wall will be built in January.

Council has accepted the Burra Rural Youth Clubâ€™s offer to repaint the Market Square Rotunda.

Burra Rural Youth have done a fine job in cleaning up around Redruth Gaol.

The plans for the Common Effluent Drainage Scheme have been completed and will be available for inspection on or after 4 January at the Council Office.
