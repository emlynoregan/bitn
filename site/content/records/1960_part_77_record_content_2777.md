The Burra Ambulance is now ready and will be handed over next Friday in Market Square.  The official presentation by the St John Council for SA will take place at 3.30 p.m.  The fund has now reached £1,356-19-0 and the committee is anxious that the total of £2,000 should be reached quickly so that the matter can be finalised by the end of the month.
