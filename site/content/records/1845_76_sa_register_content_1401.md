Shepherds	10/- to 12/- per week plus rations*

Hutkeepers	6/- to 8/- per week plus rations

Farm labourers	10/- to 14/- per week plus rations

Domestic servants	£14 to £18 per year or 5/- to 7/- per week plus board and lodging

Cooks	£18 to £25 per year plus board and lodging

Miners	25/- to 30/- a week, but skilled miners are often engaged on tribute

[* The standard rations supplied are 10 lb flour, 10 lb fresh meat, 2 lb sugar and ¼ lb of tea.]

With all this labour arriving it would be nice to see more men with capital amongst them.
