‘Old Resident’ writes about a press report of an old mine shaft being rediscovered near the Mine Store just off the main road*.  He reports a visit recently to Mr Solomon Williams of Glenelg who will be 101 in August.  Mr Williams was born on a ship two months before the family arrived in SA in 1846 and they came directly to Burra and lived first at the mine and later in a hut in the creek.  He attended Dr Stephen’s school and left Burra for Clare when he was 21, but had visited often since then.  He recalls the Mine Stores and bridge and Morphett’s, Graves’, Kingston’s & Stokes’ Shafts, but cannot recall one near the Mine Bridge: no doubt it was a prospecting shaft.  He spoke of the fire in Kingston’s Shaft when two men were suffocated and of sports at the Burra Hospital (then the Miners’ Arms Hotel) when a whole bullock was roasted.  He has lived at Glenelg for over 30 years.

[Note that the Burra Hospital was the original Burra Hotel: The Miners’ Arms Hotel became the present Burra Hotel.  Solomon Williams died 30 January 1948 aged 101.]

[*There are two possible references to the shaft at the Mine Bridge: XV, 966, 15 Nov. 1911, page 3

Accident.  A serious accident has happened at an old disused well in Kooringa and it will be covered over as will the dangerous well at the Mine Bridge, and XXXVIII, 25, 21 June 1916, page 3

An old well near the Mine Bridge is to be filled in with rubbish.  See also next page of this issue.]
