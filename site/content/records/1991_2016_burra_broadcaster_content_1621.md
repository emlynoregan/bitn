Thefts

On the night of last Sunday-Monday Oppy’s Servwell was broken into and nearly $4,500 worth of stock was stolen.

At Thimbles & Things about $600 worth of items were also taken.

On Monday a stolen vehicle was located at Porters Lagoon, having been taken from Robertstown, where the thieves had also committed a break-in.

Accident.  On Thursday a B-double sustained a broken axle and came to rest in the main street of Mt Bryan. It carried diesel fuel and rescue vehicles were called and the highway blocked off for several hours while a crane was called.

Ron & Jennifer Lugg have taken over the Burra Roadhouse from Ross & Leanne Niemz.  They were previously at Berri where Ron was in the printing trade with J.C. Irving and Jennifer worked with Berrivale Orchards for 20 years.

Anon. writes suggesting that while many seem willing to dob in relatively harmless marijuana users/growers, they are far less helpful in reporting serious crimes that affect everybody.
