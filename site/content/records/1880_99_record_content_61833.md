Mount Bryan District Council ratepayers have petitioned the Government to reduce the number of Councillors in Middle and East Wards from two to one.  Middle Ward contributes only £23-6-8 and East Ward only £13-9-6.  This is expended in travelling expenses leaving little or nothing for working expenses in these wards so that the whole burden of costs falls on West Ward which contributes £158-5-1.
