Ambulance Day in Burra was held last Saturday, 15 April.  It was a huge success.  The morning was cold and somewhat threatening, which reduced attendance somewhat, but the afternoon was very pleasant.    The 43rd Battalion Band arrived by train.  They did a fine job supplying delightful music to help the day along.

The procession was led by M-Cs McCarthy & Kain, then Mounted Boy Scouts with Scoutmaster Rigney.  Then came the Red Cross Tableaux and the Burra Band under Mr Shortridge.  The ‘Bruce’ Stall attendants came next with the ‘piano’ for 6d.  This was followed by the Boy Scouts’ cart especially fitted up in grotesque and fantastic style as ‘Hann’s Imperial Chariot’ and Rainbow Tableaux.  A zeppelin followed that inscribed with several labels: ‘Billy’s Baby-Killer’, ‘His Sausage Majesty’ & ‘William the Weed’ etc.  The school children then came along before John Bull and ‘The Allies’ before a Hay Scene and then ‘Warm Feet’, which featured Charles Burns, F. Harris, P. Milner, F. Dew & boys, the Birtle Bros on bikes, Messrs Glenister & N. Burns.  Next was The Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe with about 20 children and then Nation’s ambulance, a clown, the Rag-Time Band [A group of female musicians], followed by the star of the show, Burra & District Ambulance No. 1.  Decorated traps and motorcars brought up the rear with ‘His Satanic Majesty’ (not the Kaiser).

At the Square a splendid marquee had been set up for lunch and afternoon teas.  Mrs C.J. Pearce was in charge of Paddy’s Market, while Mr A. Walker ran the ‘Bruce’ Stall.  There was a pie stall, a lolly stall and The Burra Bunyip, but some boys who gave the game away by revealing it was only a huge pumpkin in disguise, reduced the latter’s takings to only 9/6.

Mr Hann ran a mock Bruce Stall, promising to take down all the people and succeeding very well.   His bag of chaff turned out to weigh only about 2 oz and his coil of wire was about 6” of hat wire rolled in a coil.  He collected £4-5-9 in sixpences.  The real Bruce Stall took £93-15-6.

The Westminster Warblers were a great success.  They appeared on Robertson’s motor lorry as a band of niggers and gave some good songs.  The day’s takings were c. £500.  [Subscriptions before had exceeded £224.]

At the luncheon the Mayor welcomed the 43rd Battalion Band.  A few months ago Burra had quite a good band, but now about half had volunteered.  Although Burra & District had subscribed over £15,000 in various appeals it was felt something else was wanted and so they decided on an Ambulance Day.  They had started with the idea of one ambulance, but at present there was every prospect of four.
