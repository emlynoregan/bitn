Obituary.  Miss Theresia Emily Preece aged 80 died recently at her home in Aberdeen.  She spent most of those years in Burra except for brief periods at Peterborough and Adelaide.  She arrived in SA with her parents on the Dutch ship Theresia in 1854 having been born on the voyage and christened on the boat.  Her father started business in Burra as a blacksmith and continued successfully for many years.  The family came to Burra on a bullock dray in a seven day trip.  She attended the first Sunday school in Aberdeen established by her father.  She loved reading and could still read the morning paper without glasses. [Born Theresia Emily Preece 10 July 1853 aboard the ‘Theresia’: died 19 March 1934 at Aberdeen.]
