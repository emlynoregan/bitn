Obituary & Inquest.  Booborowie Tragedy.

On Saturday last William Jeffery shot his son Arthur and then himself in a fit of temporary insanity.  There was no known immediate cause, though he seems to have been much worried by the war.  He lost a brother and son-in-law at the front and has a son there.  His son Arthur was aged 27.

I.J. Warnes JP was the coroner at the inquest on the body of Arthur Jeffery.

Samuel Jeffery identified the body of Arthur Albert Jeffery.

Jane Elizabeth Jeffery, mother of the deceased, said her husband had driven their daughter to the train at 4.20 a.m. and returned home about 1.20 p.m.  He had been cheerful and bright on leaving.  On reaching home he went to the front room and when asked what time he had got to the train he had replied that he would shoot himself and his wife too.  His wife had hidden in the chaff shed after telling Arthur what had been said.  Her small daughter had come to her and told her that William Jeffery had shot Arthur and then himself.  When she emerged Arthur shook his head, but didn’t speak to her and her little boy went for Mr Bertlesmier.

Eileen Jeffery aged 13 described seeing the shooting and then telling her mother.

Alfred Victor Jeffery also saw the incident and said that after he was shot Arthur had told him to go to get Mr Bertlesmier.

Fred. C. Baldock, farmer of Booborowie, had seen Jeffery in Burra and was with him about half an hour.  He had commented unfavourably on Baldock’s driving a German wagon and said his son was going out with a German girl and he didn’t like it.  They had two glasses of beer together and Jeffery appeared to be quite sober.

M-C North described finding the bodies of father and son.
