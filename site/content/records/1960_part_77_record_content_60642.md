M & BHA held a lunch at the Burra town Hall on 6 April, but it was not well attended, probably because it clashed with the Burra High School Sports Day.  It was disappointing that it was not supported by young mothers.  Only four clinic users attended.  The address was given by Mrs Dianne Morris, State Secretary of the Association.
