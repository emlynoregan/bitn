Les & Kathy Smale and family were given a farewell by the Burra SES on Monday night, prior to their departure to Katherine (NT).  Les & Kathy had been closely involved with the SES while in Burra, with Les becoming Controller of the Unit in early 1995.  During his time in the office, the SES raised funds for a new vehicle and became prominent in various Burra events.  In 1997 they were able to purchase a new vehicle and the official handover of keys was made at the 1998 Australia Day Breakfast â€“ which was cooked by the SES.
