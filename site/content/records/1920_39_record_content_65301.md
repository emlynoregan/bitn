Characteristics of the paper in 1936

Page 1.

The space is shared between large advertisements and news, fairly evenly, but in fluctuating proportions from week to week.

Page 2.

A couple of large advertisements.  Cash Column of small ‘classified’ type advertisements.  Public Notices, entertainment, sales and other small advertisements.  Smaller items of local news.

Page 3.

A couple of large advertisements, but mainly local news including sport.  Sometimes an article or more of general interest.

Page 4.

Some smaller advertisements, not all of them local.  Some local news in fluctuating balance with general interest articles.

In general the local news gets good coverage.  Council reports appear from Burra Town and District Councils as wellas from the District Councils of Saddleworth, Hallett and Robertstown.  School notes kept the populace up to date with the weekly testing procedures as well as with the sporting and others events in the school week; so much so that the High School headmaster dispensed with his usually lengthy report at the end of the year.
