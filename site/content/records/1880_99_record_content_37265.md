Entertainment.  There was a very fair attendance at the Institute on Friday for the Quintrell & Fisk Combination.  The performance opened with a Grand March by the Quintrell Family, then the Fisks (6 male & 9 female voices) sang ‘Ernani’ and ‘Steal Away to Jesus’.  Both the vocal and instrumental departments were good and the takings of £15 would have been better had the evening been fine.
