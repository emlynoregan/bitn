Burra Town Council, 3 March.

S. Kellaway was elected to the extraordinary vacancy caused by the resignation of Cr Harris.

(The nomination of G.C. Kuchenmeister was invalid.)

Cr Kellaway had previously represented East Ward.

H.J.B. Jennison was permitted to install a Texaco petrol tank.

The Mayoress advised she was willing to undertake the sale of Tubercular Soldiers’ Aid Soc. badges again this year.

The Committee on Stray Stock recommended:

Two yards be erected as a pound at the Corporation Depot.

H. Cullen’s application as keeper be accepted at 7/6 a week.

R. Woodman’s tender to erect yards be accepted at £2-10-0.

Cr Woollacott objected to this being handled by committee instead of by the whole of Council.  He objected to the tender notices going out before the whole of Council had approved the moves.  Council now had no say on where the pound was to be.  Such moves would not be tolerated by Parliament or even the Hospital Board – ‘the whole business was rotten and had been ever since the present Mayor had occupied the chair’.

The Mayor declared Cr Woollacott out of order and unfamiliar with Council procedure.  The cost of the procedure so far had been perhaps 15/-.  Committees must get Council approval to spend over £20.  If recommendation 1 fails, then 2 & 3 fail.  If 1 is passed then 2 & 3 might reasonably be expected to pass and therefore save Council time.

Cr Pearce took exception to Cr Woollacott’s attack as did Cr Allen.

Cr Woollacott persisted with his views.

Cr Lee thought Cr Woollacott misunderstood the role of the committee.

The three recommendations were accepted.

Other minor works were approved.

Cr Allen said there was dissatisfaction about Child’s Welfare Department rations.  Some said they had received half rations for a day’s work.

The Mayor said this was due to a misunderstanding by the men of the regulations.  A fortnight had to elapse between issues and some men had received rations before the Council work and Sgt McDonald had not the power to issue full rations again.  The Mayor would in future see that all men were treated fairly.

There was then discussion about commodities that were supplied.  Some of which (like rice and sago) were not wanted, or not wanted in the quantities given.  Commodities were inflexibly laid down by the Government.  The Mayor believed Drew & Crewes might exchange commodities if approached in the right manner.

The top road to the station had been tar-dressed.  He suggested it be made one way because the lower road owned by the Government was in such a bad state that all traffic would otherwise use the top road.

The Town Clerk was instructed to get particulars needed to declare it a one-way road.
