Road Sealing.  The Barrier Highway from Burra North to Market Square will be slurry sealed, beginning on 7 December; a process that should take four days.  This is stage two of a four stage process of upgrade.

Preparatory work by the Council.

Slurry to correct shape and roughness.

Asphalt rehabilitation at the Morehead Street intersection.

A 10/5 mm double seal on the whole length of the road.

The fourth stage is due for completion by March 2000.
