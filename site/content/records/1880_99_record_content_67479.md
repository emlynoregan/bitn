Ratepayers’ Meeting.

The Mayor’s Report showed a balance in the bank of £83-17-4.  It listed work done in each ward and showed the following credit balances in other accounts:

Parklands	£20-19-8

Cemetery	£41-7-5

Waterworks	£229-5-0

Local Board of Health	£118-1-8

The Waterworks account would drop by £160 in early January when the Government lease payment was due and by c. £20 for a new chimney.

Questions were asked about the Parklands expenditure.

Mr Henderson questioned expenditure on Taylor St amounting to £37-9-0.  From the answer of Cr Fuss this would seem to include Packard St as he explained why so much more than the estimated £20 was needed and pointed out that it was authorised by an earlier Council and he had stated before his re-election that he would be asking for work to be done on the road to his house.

E.W. Crewes said he would allow his name to be put forward as candidate for Mayor.  He had been living in the town for 22 years.  He had previously been a Councillor. He understood matters of importance would be coming up soon. The Waterworks well had only 5’ of water in it and reports from the Mine sounded encouraging and if work there was restarted we should have to look for another source of supply.  Perhaps something could be done by clearing out Jilbert’s Well and moving the plant there.  The old plant was now obsolete and it would repay the council to purchase a new six inch plunge pump which would pump more in less time at a lower cost.  At any event anew pump was needed.

Cr McLaren said that the balance in the Health account was in part because Council thought that the new regulations under the health Act would cause extra expenditure – a medical officer had to be paid.  He would like to see the rubbish depot relocated, but so far they had been unable to get a new site from SAMA.

W.H. Hardy, candidate for North Ward, said he was getting old and not as lively as he used to be.  He was concerned with the Waterworks and thought the present plant of little or no use.  He believed that a move to Jilbert’s Well on the opposite side of the creek and still pumping to the present reservoir would serve and cost about £250.  It would be better in Council hands rather than with the Government.  He favoured spending money on trees and in beautifying the parklands, including Victoria Park.

Cr Cox moved that ‘it was desirable to hand over the Waterworks to the government’. He was 2nd by Cr Pederson.

Mr Jenkin spoke against.

Mr Hardy moved ‘the matter be allowed to stand over for the new Council to deal with’ and was 2nd Mr Jenkin.

[The report is not very clear about what happened next, but it seems that Hardy’s amendment was lost and the Cox motion carried, which then allowed the question to be put to the ratepayers at the municipal election on 1 December.]
