She has lived in Burra since 1991and her husband is CEO of the Regional Council of Goyder.  They have two sons and a daughter aged 18, 16 and 14.  At the end of 1997 she began working for the local doctor and thought then that ambulance service training would aid in her job and give something back to the community.  She would urge others to consider becoming a Volunteer Ambulance Officer.
