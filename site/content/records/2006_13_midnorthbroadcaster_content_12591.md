Burra Community Library reopened late last week after its lengthy closure for renovation and refurbishment.  It had closed in early March for what was expected to be a month of work.  The old air conditioning ducting has gone, giving a feeling of more space.  The old rough walls have been coated in gyprock and there is a new ceiling with independent reverse cycle air conditioning, new carpets, a new curving circulation desk and new carpets and shelving.  The staff workroom and the Resource Room where text books and other related items are kept have both been subject to complete renovation.
