Burra Town Council, 6 October

A letter from the Secretary of the Institute’s Association advised that before any transfer of the Institute to the Council there would have to be another ratepayers’ meeting and two meetings of subscribers; one to decide on offering the Institute and one to ratify the decision.

The recommendation of the Finance Committee to declare a rate of 2/8 in the £ was adopted.

Aberdeen Croquet Club held its AGM on 4 October.  The large flood in January had damaged the croquet lawn but the club still managed to end the year in credit.  Elected: President, Mrs F.M. Pearce; Vice-Presidents, Mrs E. Finch & Mrs M.T. Fuller; Secretary, Mrs W.H. Gare; Treasurer, Miss L. Bartholomaeus; Captain, Mrs F.T. Sara and Vice-Captains, Mrs E. Steer & Mr W.H. Gare.

It was resolved to ask the Mayoress, Mrs T.H. Woollacott to open the coming season on 18 October.
