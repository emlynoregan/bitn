Notice.  W.W.G. Nicholls of Hindley Street West, 15 September 1848, begs to inform the sheep-farmers and country settlers in general, that in consequence of the bad treatment the working men receive at some of the public-houses on the road, it is prudent not to give orders on such houses, but to leave the driver open to stop or put up for the night where he thinks best, pay the menâ€™s expenses on the road, and charge it to the employers at the end of the journey.  Country gents should enquire of these men hoe they fare at these houses on the road and not fail to inform the Magistrates of any house that neglects their comfort.  If owners were compelled to keep the houses instead of letting them at enormous rents, the needed improvements would be made.  At the next licensing day I shall expose to the court four country houses and make specific complaints about others.  In this I have no private ends in view, merely wishing to make people deal justly with the weary traveller and no disgust the newcomer with this country on his first journey through it.
