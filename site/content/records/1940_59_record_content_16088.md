Miss Gertrude Pearce retired on Friday after 26½ years with the Burra Record.  Her knowledge of the local area and its people was encyclopaedic and invaluable to a country newspaper.  She was farewelled by staff and through the proprietor Mr E.F. Marston was presented with suitable gifts.  As well as the paper her interests included the Kooringa Methodist Church and Sunday School and she had been the organist at morning Sunday school from the age of 10 till April last year.  She has also been pianist and secretary as well as a teacher there.  She was a long time member of the choir before becoming organist for many years until giving up the job last year, bringing to an end 75 years of the Pearce family supplying the church organist.  The late Mr John Pearce was organist for 35 years, to be followed by Miss Alice Pearce, Miss Trix Pearce and Miss Gert Pearce, with Miss Jean Herbert for morning services.  When the latter was married [1932] Miss Gert Pearce took over all services.  In the Great War she was an enthusiastic worker for the Cheer-Up Society.  At present she is living with her sister Mrs A. Dearlove at Ketchowla.
