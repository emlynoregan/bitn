Police Court, Kooringa, 5 June, Resident Magistrate W. Lang and Henry Mildred JP.

A.H. Stace of the Southampton Arms charged Mary Edwards, wife of John Edwards, with the theft of a £10 order on the Burra Company.  He believed the order was taken from his house.  Yesterday morning a lot of orders were lying on his bed; they did not exactly amount to £5,000.Mrs Wilks and Mrs Edwards were at the bar yesterday morning and Mrs Stace asked Mrs Wilks into the bedroom.  Mrs Edwards followed.  Later the £10 order was missed.  He enquired and found it had been cashed at the Burra Hotel.  He knew the order produced was the one lost.

[A deal of evidence was taken on the exact procedures in the morning.  Mr Stace had to conceded that on one previous occasion he had once given a man a 25/- order in change in mistake for a 5/- order.  Mrs Stace gave evidence corroborating her husband’s.

Sergeant-Major McCulloch said the prisoner admitted having the order, but said she had received it in change for a 10/- order.  [Stace had said he was sure he had received no money from Mrs Edwards and that Mrs Wilks had paid for both the ladies’ drinks.]

Mrs Edwards told him she had given the £10 order to her brother and offered to give Stace a different £10 order.  He arrested the brother for receiving.  The brother was then intoxicated and McCulloch had no reason to know he had been previously deprived of the money he received in change at the hotel.  The brother said he had been among the blacks and they had robbed him.

Samuel Mason, acting landlord at the Burra Hotel and Robert Cooper, barman, gave evidence that the £10 order in question had been cashed, but could not confirm who had handed it in.  George Tapp gave evidence that the transaction took place, but he too was vague on identities.

Catherine Wilks gave evidence that she had bought two drinks to take away and paid for them, getting coins in change.  She said Mrs Edwards had bought a pint of beer and a glass of brandy and had paid for them with an order and received an order and coins in change.

After further details Richard Morgan was sworn and said Mrs Stace had once accused him of stealing a missing order, which was later found in her bed-clothes.  Mr Fitzgerald said this went to show the very loose manner in which Mr & Mrs Stace kept their money orders about the house.

The case was then adjourned and resumed on 7 June.

After a couple more witnesses Mr Fitzgerald summed up, pointing out inconsistencies in the evidence of the various witnesses.  He pointed out that neither of the accused could read or write and so would not know what was on an order received in change.  He contended there was no case to answer.

After retiring for 20 minutes Mr Lang returned and said the Bench had decided that the charge of stealing the order was not sustained and as a consequence the charge of receiving a stolen order failed.

From the known good characters of the prisoners this case excited much interest at Kooringa; and we understand that Mr Fitzgerald has received instructions to commence an action against Mr Stace forthwith.
