Burra DC.  9 June.  The Chairman has written to the Chief Secretary seeking a delay in the formation of the Mt Bryan DC until arrangements have been made for reconstituting the Burra District.  The Council resolved that no further objections be made to the formation of the new district.  The majority of the Council favoured the following arrangements:

South Ward with one councillor to remain unchanged

Kooringa Township to constitute one ward with one councillor

Outside portion of the old Kooringa ward to constitute a ward with one councillor

Redruth and Aberdeen, inside the boundary of the police district to constitute one ward with one councillor

The same outside the police district to constitute one ward with one councillor

Mr Gebhardt’s resignation as Councillor for North Ward was accepted.

Crs Killicoat and McCulloch are to retire by rotation.

The well near Mr Hutson’s is to be filled in by daymen.
