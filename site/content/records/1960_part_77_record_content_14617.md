Fred, Walter and Paddy Williams had Christmas together at Burra for the first time in 61 years – arranged by Mr & Mrs Fred Williams Jnr. Fred from Burra North is 73, Walter from Mildura in 74 and Paddy of Burra is 80.

Mr Clive Hope of Waikerie Gliding Club made a forced landing in a stubble paddock near Burra when the wind failed him.  The landing was perfect on A.G. Heinrich’s property.

A Swimming Carnival scheduled for Sunday between Clare, Spalding and Burra, was postponed due to the bad weather.

Members of the Department of Mines will shortly begin drilling at the Burra Mine site, beginning east of the old workings and will test over a distance of 1,500 ft to a point beneath the open cut.

West Street Burra North should be sealed in eight days of work commencing next week.
