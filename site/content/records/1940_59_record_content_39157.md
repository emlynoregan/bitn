Burra Town Council, 18 October

After inspecting the Burra Cold Stores premises, the Council decided to allow waste water [from bottle washing] to run into the drain in front of their premises providing it was kept clean and fresh to the satisfaction of the Health Officer.

SAR advised it did not propose any further work on the Station Road in this financial year.

Thank you received from Burra War Memorial Committee for the Council’s resolution to raise a loan of £800.

Resolved to approach the PMG Department to request public telephone capable of handling local and trunk calls be placed near the District Council Office in Burra and near the Burra and Burra North Post Offices.
