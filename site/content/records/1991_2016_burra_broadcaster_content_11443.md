St Mary’s Church

Two new memorial stained glass windows were dedicated on 29 September.  They honour the life of Andrew Tiver.  The artist was Owen Turner of Nairne.  There was a sung Evensong led by Fr John Davenport, assisted by the local ecumenical choir, with Clem Davey as organist.  The dedication was performed by Fr David Lamont who was the parish priest at the time of Andrew’s tragic death in September 1992.  He is now at Heywood in Victoria.  A sumptuous afternoon tea followed.
