Local Improvements in SA

[This is a long article outlining developments across the colony.  It begins with a lengthy description of the erection of much needed new cottage housing in the city and goes on to describe many new hotels, shops and other businesses.  With more direct relevance to Burra are the following items mentioned.]

J.B. Graham, one of the SA Mining Association’s largest shareholders, is about to build an elegant villa, designed by the architect Mr Price, at Prospect Village.  It will be on several acres of land with extensive gardens.  Mr Bouch, who is also about to require intends to build at Prospect as well.

Gawler Town is rapidly growing, in part due to the increasing traffic to and from the mines.  The proprietors of Calton’s Hotel there are about to erect a new roadside inn at a probable cost exceeding £2,000.  Income from land sales is allowing the Government to invest in public works and £2,500 has been allocated to the building of a stone bridge at Gawler.  [Other Government expenditures on a wide range of items are listed.]
