Editorial on The Burra Institute.  There is a history of its development.

A meeting in April 1856 determined to have a Mechanics Institute.  It was thought £600 was needed and several schemes were devised to finance it, but they fell through.  Rev. Ibbetson visited Adelaide and got the encouragement of Sir Henry Ayers, Mr Hamilton, and the then Governor.  The next meeting that was held proposed a hall to seat 300 and a dwelling of three rooms.  About £130 was soon collected.  A letter was received saying the Independent Church was for sale, but ambitious workers were determined to secure a building of their own.  £400 had by then been raised.  SAMA donated the site in 1856.  Eventually there was a substantial donation from SAMA and from the E & A Copper Co. which helped bring the total to £900.  It was proposed that the building be called the Burra Burra Mineers and Mechanics Institute.  On 28 January 1857 the tender of Messrs Tiver, Cole and Sinnegear was accepted for £446-16-0 for the mason work and Mr Bruse’s offer of £473 to do the woodwork was agreed to.  J.W. McDonald, Chairman of the Committee laid the foundation stone on 26 Feb. 1857 and the building was opened on 27 Aug. 1857.  There were hymns and pieces sung in English and German.  Mr Birbeck was appointed the first librarian and Mr Ibbetson the first secretary.  Mr Davey, the present librarian, is the sole remaining resident from the first committee.
