At the Parliamentary Club held in the Burra Institute in 1878 the late Sir Frederick Holder moved a resolution that a committee of 10 be appointed with the object of starting a paper and to guarantee an overdraft at the bank for Â£200.  They [the committee] then arranged for two printers from Adelaide, Henry Pether and Frank Jarman to publish the same and a short time later they engaged R.H. Ball as editor.  He remained only a short time before joining the National Bank.  In 1883 Mr Holder took possession.  In reference to the dugouts Anderson agreed that they should be preserved, but should have a different appearance to the ones in the photo, as the old huts were neatly cut out of the banks and had neat little gardens in front, had doors and windows and some also had verandahs.  He feared not many were left who had lived in such huts.  The only one other than his brother and himself that he was aware of was Mr Sol. Williams of Glenelg.  He says: We lived in one for five years from December 1856 to about the same month in 1861, when we were all ordered to leave the huts and the difficulty was then to find a cottage, as they were scarce.  We managed to get one almost immediately on account of the previous tenant committing suicide, as most people were afraid of ghosts.
