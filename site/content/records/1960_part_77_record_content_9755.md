The Heliothis Grub poses a threat to lucerne seed crops in the next few weeks.  The moth has become more prevalent lately after a long period of little change.  Recommended control is 2 ounces of actual DDT (8 oz of 25 p.m. DDT) to the acre.  One spray gives one weekâ€™s protection at this time of the year.
