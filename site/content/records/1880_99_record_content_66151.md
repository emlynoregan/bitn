Mr Thomas (Independent):

He was for Federation and a reduction in the number of local MPs.  He opposed household suffrage and favoured a six year term for the Legislative Council with half retiring every three years.  He opposed the abolition of the upper house and was strongly against the capitation grant.  He did not think the seed wheat provisions were generous and the fund should be nationalised.  He favoured the Closer Settlement Act and would increase the value of a holding to Â£1,500 as in some areas a living could not be made on less.  He favoured the railways to Perth and Pt Darwin on a land grant system and a railway to Queensland if it could be shown to pay.  He was for an Outer harbour only after the railways.  He supported Government assistance for mining development and was for making the State Bank one of deposit and issue.
