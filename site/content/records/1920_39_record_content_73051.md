Burra Town Council, 21 November

The Unemployment Council advises that a special cash grant for Christmas Cheer will be available as usual.  Male participants are to work for the amount and are not to be paid before the week ending 23 December.

Jeffery & Byrne’s offer of £2-10-0 for the disused rotunda fence was accepted.

Riding of bicycles across the swing bridge has been banned.  Notices will be erected.

Cr Lott wanted a light placed in front of Drew & Crewes’ store until it was occupied.  Council decided it was unnecessary.

The Council’s drays, harnesses etc. are to be sold.

Cr Lott said he was assured the swimming pool committee had a fair sum in hand and work could soon start.  He suggested £400 be set aside for it.

The Mayor said when enough money was raised by the committee the Council’s contribution would be forthcoming.

Cr Lott said he had heard the Mayor had said Council had insufficient funds at present.

The Mayor refused to answer further questions on the subject.

Christmas Cheer money is to be spent on cleaning up the cemetery.
