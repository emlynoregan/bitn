Editorial on Burra Stock Sales

Stock markets here have grown rapidly in the past five years.  The farmers have had to contend with rabbits, droughts etc., but we look forward to a time when farmers in the East ‘instead of having to keep their farms by dint of wood and wool carting may be kept by their farms, and then the Burra will reap the benefit of that extension of settlement which as yet has only little more than promised profit.’

Our merchants are still doing a large business trading with the stations in the NE of SA and far into NSW, receiving wood [sic, but perhaps wool?] and despatching stores.  They have also established trade with Mt Brown Gold Mining Districts and hope for business at Waukaringa.

A few years ago the regular monthly sales at Burra were of little importance - a few horses, second hand vehicles, implements etc., cows and the odd lot of sheep.  Now sales are held at least at least three times a month and it is not unusual for 25,000 sheep to be catalogued in one sale and the numbers of cattle and horses are also large.  Stock comes from over the border and all parts of SA.  The tradespeople reap the most direct advantage.  It is in the town’s interest to place no obstacles in the way of this trade, but some think the town should obtain some revenue from this source.

The Corporation could erect sale yards and then prohibit the sale of stock elsewhere, but the sales could then just as easily be held just beyond the town limits leaving grass to grow in the yards belonging to the ratepayers.  The trade could also be drawn to other centres.  At a conference between the Council and Stock Agents the latter have agreed to pay a fixed sum per annum so as to avoid future agitation on the question.  We are glad the matter has been settled and though the salesmen cannot be compelled to pay anything, they have volunteered to do so.
