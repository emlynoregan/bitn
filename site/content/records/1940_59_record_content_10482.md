The Season has clearly been wet out east.  Two bushmen of the likes of Len & George Gallagher donâ€™t often experience the troubles they had last week.  They left Quondong on Thursday to go to Burra.  On Thursday evening they got seriously bogged near Sturt Vale, so deeply mired that it took most of the night to get out.  They continued, but got bogged on Friday night near Murkaby and again worked long before reaching Burra on Saturday morning, having taken two days for a 120 mile journey.  In recent years it could never have happened due to lack of rain.
