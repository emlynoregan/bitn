Burra Mine

The Chairman of the Burra Burra DC sent telegrams yesterday to the Premier Mr Dunstan, the Leader of the Opposition Dr Tonkin and the Minister of Mines Mr Hudson.  They expressed the hope that some action could be taken to save 62 jobs directly involved at the Burra Mine following the concern of people in the town and district towards Samin Ltd being in receivership.  He believed the mine was viable even at the present depressed copper prices and that future operations were straight forward and efficient.
