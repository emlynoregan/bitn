The Storm of 16 December: Further Reports.

The water rushing down the creek near Dr Sangster’s flowed over the Commercial St bridge and then down the street to flood Market Square.  The thunder continued to roll and the lightning was the most vivid for years.  Footpaths on Market Square were flooded and mud covered the flagstones.  Some houses in the lower part of the town were flooded.  A washaway on the train line at Yunta delayed the Broken Hill train until late on Wednesday evening.  Over 3” of rain fell at Springbank.

At Leighton one resident had about 30 turkeys drown and another lost a number of fowls and several settings of eggs.  Dead rabbits were left along Burra Creek.

House gutters overflowed into rooms in several places.

A farmer at the west of town lost 20-30 bags of wheat down the creek and another lost several pigs.  Around the district the loss of sheep is considerable.  Mr Duldig at World’s End had left a plough and scoop in the nearby creek after dam work and the former was swept 600 yards and the latter a mile.  He lost 6 chains of fencing to rushing water.  Over 2” fell in the afternoon and another 1” at night.
