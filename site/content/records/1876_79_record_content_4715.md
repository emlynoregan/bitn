Editorial on the Water Supply. What is being done? 
1. The Govt. has spoken of including the supply of Burra in the supplementary estimates — not yet before the House. 
2. We do not believe it necessary or desirable to have a house-to-house supply for the whole town. Many people possess good wells and a spread out town like ours would be too costly to service. 
‘On the other hand we saw, only a week or two since, some persons dipping up with some small vessel into a bucket the thick, unclean, and unhealthy contents of a puddle by the roadside, and carrying it carefully homeward. It could not have been to wash anything with, so we are driven to the conclusion that it was for drinking or cooking purposes.’ More than ever the prosperity of Burra depends on the outside country which is represented by teams with more to come with harvest time. There is at present no adequate provision for watering teams. It becomes desirable for some scheme to be put in hand as early as possible. An inexhaustible source must be chosen. It does not have to be high as it only needs to reach the most thickly settled parts which are all at the lower levels. 
Pipes must be laid from the source to convenient points central to the houses not having a supply — say Paxton Square, Market Square and one or two other points in Kooringa, and four or five points in Aberdeen-Redruth. Each point to have a standpipe and trough. The water to be sold at so much per 1,000 gallons. A meter should check totals. 
A house supply could be arranged for those houses where it was desired along the route of the main; to be metered and charged for, but with no cost to the non-users.
