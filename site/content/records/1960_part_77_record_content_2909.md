Burra CWA held its AGM 17 June.  Elected: President Mrs H. Jennison; Vice-Presidents, Mesdames H. Riggs & M. Finch; Secretary, Mrs S. Scroop and Treasurer, Miss E. Tiver.

D.E. Pietsch the retiring President reported on an active and successful year.

During the year a committee was formed to build premises for the CWA in Burra.  A block of land was acquired, which has since been donated to the CWA by the family of the late Mrs I.J. Warnes as a memorial to her work for the Burra CWA.  A fine financial result rewarded the effort of staging the Antique Show.

The Secretary Mrs Florence Scroop reported the branch had 72 financial members with an average attendance of 20.

[Details of the yearâ€™s activities are reported.]

Two deaths are reported for the year: Mrs Clode and Mrs I.J. Warnes, late President and foundress of the CWA in SA.

[Born Ada Jane Burton 19 June 1897 Mt Bryan: died 25 February 1960 Burra North.  Married Arthur Lawrence Clode 1925.]
