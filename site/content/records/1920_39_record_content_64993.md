I have been acting for Mr E.J. Harris in his unfortunate position and as his solicitor.  I have insisted he includes every creditor in his list of liabilities and to the best of my knowledge he has done so.  Also it seems Mr Worth has been accused of unfair conduct towards Mr Harris at and after his meeting of creditors.  Such a rumour is unfounded.  If Mr Worth has erred, it is on the side of generosity.
