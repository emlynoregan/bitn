Ally Fricker, chairperson of SIWT writes again opposing wind farm development.  This time she is reporting an investigation of a conflict of interest by the SA Ombudsman.  In May 2011 SIWT requested this investigation when Cr John Neal did not consider he had a conflict of interest and should step down from the Goyder Council Development Assessment Panel.  The panel was hearing an application relating to a wind energy project at Stony Gap and Cr Neal receives some income from the same developer.  The Ombudsman agreed there was a clear conflict of interest.  It was disturbing that Cr Neal’s stand was supported by Goyder’s CEO, John Brak; Mayor, Peter Mattey and the DAP Chair, Colleen Woodgate.  The recent changes to the rules make it all the more important that there is full financial disclosure and no conflict of interest amongst members of Council’s decision making bodies.

[She then goes on to draw attention to the changes to assessment procedures as outlined in Edition No. 1004, 26 October 2011, pages 1 & 3.]
