Kooringa News, 11 May

We have been visited by some rain; steady, but not copious.  We hear they have had rain beyond Kanyaka.

Rev. Stanton’s income has been lamentably deficient; being not half the amount held out to him in England as an inducement to come here.  At a vestry meeting last Thursday a resolution establishing the weekly offertory was carried with the object of supplementing Mr Stanton’s income.

A party visited a new mining claim on the Booborowie Run last week.  They reported favourably. I believe it consists of some old workings begun by Dr Browne some considerable time ago and abandoned.
