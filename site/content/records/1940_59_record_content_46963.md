Wilcannia & Points North, Part 3

[At Wilcannia the group decided to go via White Cliffs rather than to take the Momba Road.  White Cliffs was 60 miles over fair tracks.  The centre of White Cliffs is described as a square, lined on two sides with a few shops and a hotel.  The square was the townâ€™s rubbish tip.  Apparently the inhabitants just chucked empty fruit tins etc. outside their front doors.  The group then had c. 90 miles to go over one of the stoniest and worst roads in Australia with homesteads every 15 miles or so.  At creek crossings all but the driver got out and walked, to increase the clearance a bit above the stones.  The last stretch was worse, being practically treeless, bushless and grassless.  The homestead they sought lay on the far side of a flooded creek, but a chap came out and guided them through a swamp in which one car got bogged.  After negotiating the swamp, there were still some 20 miles of rough track to Wongalilli.]
