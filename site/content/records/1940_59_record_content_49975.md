Myxomatosis is still spreading.  It is very widely spread in NSW and Victoria and has recently made big inroads in southern inland Queensland.  It has reached Adelaide in SA and the desert marginal area of the Birdsville Track.  High controlling mortalities though, are confined to areas where mosquito numbers are high, such as rive r flats and frontages and swampy margins.
