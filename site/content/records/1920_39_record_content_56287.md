Obituary.  I.J. Goodridge, who died recently, was born at Bournemouth UK 21 April 1856 and came to SA with his parents in 1863.  Eventually they settled at Black Springs where he spent his youth.  He was connected with the Glendore Methodist Church.  After his mother died the family moved to Gum Creek.  In 1881 he married Mary Ann, daughter of the late Thomas Hutchins, in the Ironmine Methodist Church.  When Booborowie opened up, he took a workingmanâ€™s block and with his young family settled there in 1890 and has lived there ever since.  Shortly after arriving there he, and a few other pioneers, established the Booborowie Wesleyan Church and he has held all offices associated with that church, except that of organist.  His interest continued after Methodist Union and he encouraged his family to take a role in Sunday school matters.  [The surviving family are:]  Messrs T.E.G. Goodridge of Mt Bryan and A.E. Goodridge of Booborowie and Mesdames A. Todd of Adelaide, F.J. Pratt of Collinswood, W. Lomman of Booborowie, H.R. Edwards of Mt Bryan, F.J. Pratt of Mt Bryan East and 23 grandchildren.  His son, C.J. Goodridge, died of war injuries in 1933 and his wife predeceased him two years ago.

[Isaac James Goodridge died 6 May 1935 Adelaide, residence Collinswood.]
