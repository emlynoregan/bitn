SA Temperance Alliance had a one side small flyer [perhaps quarto] urging voters to vote in the top square in the local option poll.  The three options were:

That the number of licences be reduced.

That the number of licences be not increased or reduced.

That the Licensing Bench may in their discretion increase the number of licences.
