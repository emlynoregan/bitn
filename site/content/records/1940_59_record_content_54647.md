The Burra Kindergarten will close from 3 May to 2 June owing to the Supervisorâ€™s annual holidays.  Several families have left the district, lowering the already small enrolment.  Parents are urged to enrol children to keep the Kindergarten going.  As we go to press it has just been decided that due to low numbers the Kindergarten will close from today to 2 June.
