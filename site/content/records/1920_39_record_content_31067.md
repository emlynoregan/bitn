W.F.E. Smith, a commercial airman now living in Burra, said he is making arrangements for a plane and pilot instructor to come to Burra so that a Flying Club can be established and pilots trained, but a fair number are needed to justify the expense.  Forward names and addresses to him at Box 58 Kooringa.  Mr Maurice Collins has been written to about the use of his Copperhouse paddock.  Flying Membership fee of the club would be £3-3-0 and 10 hours of instruction £25.
