Burra Town Council, 3 August

Council declared a rate of 2.8 in the pound – unchanged from the previous year.

Crs Marston and Kellaway reported on discussions concerning a possible joint takeover of the Burra Institute with the Burra Burra DC.  They considered such a move unlikely due to numerous legal difficulties.

Cr Samuel is to be written to, asking if he was to be in camp for the duration of the war.

Cr Harvey said the concrete pillars at the end of the swing bridge at Gully’s Wharf were loose and he moved that a concrete pillar be placed in the centre of the bridge to take its weight.  Cr Fisher seconded.

The Mayor said it was a waste of money, as in a flood it would trap debris and be swept away.

Cr Harvey said if it were streamlined that would not happen.

Cr Fisher said there were many pillars in the middle of bridges across creeks in Victoria and they were successful.  The motion was carried.
