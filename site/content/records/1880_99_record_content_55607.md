Characteristics of the paper in 1894

These are essentially unchanged from 1893.

Page 1

Large advertisements, some not local.

Page 2

Smaller advertisements.  Local businesses along with sales and public notices.

News sometimes gets a start, but often only a little and it is frequently pushed onto page three before it gets a start.

Page 3

Largely local news and reports from correspondents from surrounding districts.  Occasional pieces from further afield and a few items of humour.  The ‘Sparks’ column continues to be somewhat enigmatic at times.

Page 4

Larger advertisements, mostly not local.
