There is reference to Mr Rabbich as a rough diamond who reminds the author of:

‘Don’t look for heddication, for that’s what I ain’t got,

But still I ain’t a fool in spite of that;

For a man mayn’t have book larnin’, but still may know a lot

If he’s got eyes to see with and knows just what is what.’
