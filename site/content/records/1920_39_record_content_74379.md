Road Accident.  William Kakoschke, carrier of Aberdeen, was seriously injured in a motor accident 4½ miles south of Gawler on 19 March and is still in hospital at Gawler.  The truck was involved in a collision with a car driven by Duvall Parr, a hawker of Hilton.  Clement Norman Kakoschke was driving his father’s truck and those injured were Mr Kakoschke and his son Glen.  Mr Kakoschke sustained a broken shoulder and concussion.  Glen has leg injuries and broken fingers.  Mrs Kakoschke received minor injuries.  Mr K. Murdoch, schoolteacher of Copperhouse, and other members of the Kakoschke family were returning from Seventh Day Adventist meetings in Adelaide.  Mr Kakoschke was riding on the trailer which received the full impact of the collision.

[A note on page 2 of the same issue says Glen Kakoschke has returned home.]
