AdChem announced today it was suspending part of its copper treating operations at Burra, with a consequent loss of 46 jobs.  The concentrate treatment facility will be placed on a care and maintenance basis as a result of the short supply of copper concentrate around the world.  This has made smelters fiercely competitive for toll smelting and has made AdChem’s operations here uneconomic.  The decision was announced at Burra by AdChem’s General Manager Mr Mark Woodhead.

He also said the production of the company’s main source of income, copper oxide, would not be affected and the company would continue to employ about 40 staff at the plant.

AdChem is the world’s largest producer of copper oxide and exports to more than 25 countries.  90% if the copper oxide is exported to be used in electronics, timber preservation and agriculture.  Although the concentration process has been suspended, the company says it has identified sources of copper-bearing materials which could be amenable for treatment through part of the existing plant.  A development program is being instituted.
