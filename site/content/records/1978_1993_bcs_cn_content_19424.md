John G. Monfries

Aged 41 and an accountant and registered taxation agent.  I am employed by the Adelaide Chemical Co. as the Operation Accountant.  My wife and I moved to Burra in 1987 as full time residents, when I was engaged by an accounting and taxation practice in Clare before taking my present position.  I understand the needs of the farming and grazing sectors in the community, having previously been a manager of a grazing and stud property in the South East and also through accountancy.  My involvement as Treasurer of the National Trust Branch has led me to believe that for Burra to continue to grow and develop in an orderly manner there must be a balance between development, tourism and heritage.  We should be looking at ways of providing quality jobs for our young.  Council needs to communicate with the community and I would favour a regular Council Newsletter.  I believe I have distinctive skills that can assist Council to be a more productive institution.
