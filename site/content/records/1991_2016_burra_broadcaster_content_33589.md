Letter.  Barbara Rayner of Hallett writes re galah recipes.  She recalls many years ago that her father used to shoot ducks and even the occasional bush turkey that ended up on their table.  Failing that, he sometimes returned with a bag of galahs that the children then had to pluck â€“ a very difficult process.  She has since been told that they should have skinned the birds, but that advice came too late.  The birds were stewed with onions and herbs and were then regarded as a treat and were not tough.
