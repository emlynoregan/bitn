The Telegraph at the Burra Station has been closed and it is said that in lieu of it a telephone will be installed at the Aberdeen post office.  Mr Tiver, who was the telegraph operator at the railway station, has been told to go to Cockburn.  [It would seem that the telephone at the Aberdeen post office would have allowed people to send telegrams by having them phoned through to the Kooringa telegraph office.]
