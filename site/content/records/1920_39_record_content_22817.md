Rev. & Mrs Alvey were farewelled from the Redruth Methodist Circuit at the Redruth Memorial Hall on Monday evening.  He has been granted 12 months leave of absence for a trip to England.  He has been in the circuit for three years.

J.G. Sara spoke of Mr Alvey’s ‘strong personality, high ideals, lofty character, a good organiser.’

Mrs Alvey had been associated strongly with the church, choir, Sunday school etc.  His appreciation of the work of Mr & Mrs Alvey was supported by speeches from W.J. Woollacott for local preachers, W.H. Gare for the choir, R.G. Williams for the Sunday school, Rev. R.H. Lee for the Kooringa Church, J. Drew for Kooringa Sunday School & W.H. Lloyd for Ironmine.  Mrs H.H. Thomas presented a wallet of £50 from the Redruth Church.  James Reed presented a handsomely bound address.  Mrs H. Jennison presented Mrs Alvey with a gold-mounted malachite brooch.  Miss A. Bentley spoke for the junior Sunday school and asked Bobby Johns to present Douglas & Francis Alvey with a camera.

Ironmine Methodist Church Anniversary was celebrated recently and Rev. Alvey preached two fine sermons to crowded congregations and on the occasion Mr W.H. Lloyd presented a roll of notes to Rev. Alvey on behalf of the church as a measure of esteem and wished the family a happy holiday in England.
