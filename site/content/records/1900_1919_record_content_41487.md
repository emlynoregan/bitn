Inquest into the death of Miss M. Lovell by E.W. Crewes JP.

She had died either in a trap or soon after being taken into the Bon Accord Hotel.  Gertrude Tester, her sister, gave evidence of symptoms of nausea, stomach pains and dysentery.  She had suffered a fall from a horse at Middleton one day since Christmas.

Dr Steele had been summoned to the hotel and pronounced life extinct.  The post mortem examination was not conclusive.  He recommended stomach contents be sent for analysis.  She was an emaciated young woman aged about 19.  In the absence of other information from the stomach he would have no hesitation in giving the cause of death as diabetes.
