Mintaro-Farrell Flat Primary School

A meeting last week decided to close the Mintaro Campus.  With falling enrolments, the school was only continuing at considerable physical, financial and emotional cost.  The school community voted on 16 August 31 to 19 in favour of closure.  District Director, Trevor Tiller will now advise the Minister for Education that the campus shut at the end of the year.
