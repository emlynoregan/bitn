The gardens are in fair condition.

The cemetery is well kept and has recently been cleaned up.

There have been no serious outbreaks of disease this year.

The hospital costs ratepayers £170 p.a.

The Main Roads are in good order.  48 chains of the Clare road were formed and metalled.

The road to the eastern boundary was completed.  £200 received from Unemployment Relief Council for the Burra-Peterborough Road for about 54 chains from the goods shed gate to the northern boundary.

Many roads in the wards were remade and footpaths formed and watertables cleared out when 50 men were employed under Christmas Relief on a £ for £ basis.

We are going to construct a double crossing from the stockyards to the railway with Messrs Elder, Smith & Goldsbrough, Mort supplying pipes.

Following a deputation to the Commissioner of Public Works practically all the town’s old mains have been renewed, which should meet the needs of those on higher ground.  Work to supply drinking water at Mongolata has also been completed.  The battery there is also in the course of construction.

Distinguished visitors this year have been:

Premier Hon. L.L. Hill

Mr W. Adey, Director of Education

The Commissioner of Public works

Commissioner McKenzie of the Salvation Army

Chief Commissioner of Scouts, Mr Gratton

Mr F.J. Mills.

The Unemployment relief Council supplied boots, shoes and flannel for Mongolata prospectors.

The financial balance sheet is printed and as pointed out by Cr Dow receipts and expenditure do not balance by some £59.
