Hanson Hall

A well-advertised meeting at the Council Chamber on 14 June drew 7.  M.J. Marchant was elected to the chair and G.T. Patullo was elected secretary; Patron, Hon. W.G. Duncan and President, W.G. Hawkes.  The committee comprises M.J. Marchant, J.E. Hogan, A.C. Aughey, R.W. Uppill, H. Brown, R. Mickel & W. Rule.  There are numerous Vice-Presidents.

Mr Marchant said he was tired of raising money for things that were not bought.  He had raised money for a woodwork bench, a football and a basketball and the money was all banked.  He wondered if people thought it was in his pocket.  He was sure a hall could be built for £200.  Mr Pattullo had an idea of erecting a framework and nailing iron on the inside and adding the outside iron as more money was raised.  He also thought stone was as cheap.  A mason said he could erect 8 yards of stone a day at 10/- per day, so walls should not cost more than £25 for a 50ft x 40ft x 15ft building.  Mr Hogan thought not much could be done with the money in hand and not much could presently be raised.  Mr Marchant said he knew the Methodists don’t want a hall: they had a place built they can’t pay for.  Mr Bishop said they could pay for it.  They needed to remember they were erecting a memorial and should therefore make it something decent.  A further meeting is to be held.
