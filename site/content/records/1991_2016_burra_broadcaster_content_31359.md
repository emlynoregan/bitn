Letter.  D.R. Woolley writes wondering just how serious we are about the state of the River Murray when he saw a large stockpile of large diameter pipes alongside the already existing pipeline serving the Clare Valley.  It seems the increased supply would be largely to expand the dripper-fed vineyard systems that are rapidly expanding in the area.
