Tpr Rollin Dare was tendered a social at the Mt Bryan East Methodist Church on 15 March.  Some 150 attended, perhaps the largest crowd ever for that venue.  Various items of music and recitation were performed and community singing before speeches by Rev. C.R. Dadds, B.H.K. Dunstan, Envoy R.C. Winfield, H. Lavery, K. Miller, H. Doyle and Lewis Gare.  A letter of thanks for gifts received was read from Pte Theo Pohlner.  Presentations were made and supper followed.
