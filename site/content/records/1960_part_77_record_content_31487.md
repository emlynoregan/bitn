Fire

A fire broke our just before 6 a.m. in the home of Mr & Mrs R. Spackman in Chapel Street.  Mr & Mrs Spackman were awakened by the smell of smoke and saw flames coming from the back bedroom where their six-year-old son Peter was sleeping.  He escaped with slight burns to his head.  Mr Spackman attempted to extinguish the fire with a garden hose while Mrs Spackman was getting four other children out of the house.  (Two of the boys were not at home at the time.)  The fire brigade saved the front area of the house, which was not insured.  Damage is estimated at c. $1,500.  The cause of the fire is unknown.  Many locals have given donations of clothing etc. and money has been given by the Burra Benevolent Fund and the PMG Distress Fund.  Mrs D. Carpenter of Burra North has provided temporary accommodation.  The adjoining home of Mr & Mrs W.H .Wahlert was saved, but suffered extensive smoke damage.
