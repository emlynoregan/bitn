Copperhouse School visiting day was held on Friday last.  There was an exhibition of drilling and a program of songs and poems.  There was a display of sewing, woodwork and work books.  There had been a 100% promotion this year.  During the year Miss Seidel had had to give up her position as head teacher due to illness and the school had been closed for some days before Mr Nelson had taken up his position.  Miss N. Steer was his assistant.
