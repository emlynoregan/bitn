Redruth first appears on the quarterly minute book 24 June 1851, but no members are recorded and the income was 5/4.  Three months later there were four members and the income was £1-6-6.  In the preceding February Kooringa trustees began to build a church opposite the police court and £1-17-10 was collected at the laying of the foundation stone.  Mr R. Reed wheeled the mortar for building the church which cost £228 and was opened free of debt.
