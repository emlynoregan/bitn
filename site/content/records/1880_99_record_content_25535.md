Football.  On Saturday last 11 Colours played about 13 Non-Colours, but soon the Non-Colours split and the match had to be abandoned.  A game then took place between a side chosen by the Captain and one chosen by the Vice-Captain.  Lott’s Side 1.3 defeated Symon’s Side 0.1.  Sides were not yet following the new rules.
