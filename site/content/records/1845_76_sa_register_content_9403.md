Robert Cowper writes re G.S. Kingston, would-be Member for the Burra.

[He says he has read Kingston’s letter of thanks with regret.  He says Kingston thanks his committee for their untiring exertions.  Firstly the committee was composed entirely of officers of the Mining and Smelting Companies.  They certainly left undone nothing that would ensure a vote for Kingston, whether by intimidation or otherwise.  The fact that Kingston’s opponent did not differ from him in his political principles was, says Cowper, common across the electorates of the colony.  The comment that Mildred did not appear until the last minute is contemptible, since Kingston well knew the reason for it and as for asserting Mildred’s committee only did it for a lark! That is insulting and impudent.  Kingston had also objected to some of his supporters being disenfranchised on the day because they had moved house and so their registration was incorrect.  Cowper says in each case the objection was valid.]
