Maurice Collins writes again re the moving of the guns.  He says that Mr Crewes clouds the issue.  His original words seem to me to reflect on the whole citizenry when he says ‘people forget the wonderful sacrifices made by our boys’.  As for the contention that I alone am responsible for the fact that things have not been done that should have been, I say that on several occasions I asked Mr Crewes what my position was with respect to the Memorial Committee.  He either would not or could not inform me.  I also approached the secretary several times to call a meeting.  He refused, apparently believing that Mr Crewes was the Chairman.  It took a lot of agitation and bringing the matter to other members of the committee before a meeting was finally called on 10 October 1925 and that was when it was resolved that the Mayor by virtue of his office should be President of the Burra Soldiers’ Memorial Committee.  Let the public judge.
