Inquest into the Brewery Paddock Fire of Sunday 31 January: held at Kooringa Hotel.

Cuthbert James saw the fire start about midday about 200 yards from the road as he came in from Baldina.  There was no one about.  He reported it to Mr Killicoat and then the police.

W.J. Richards, when told, mounted his motor [i.e. a motor cycle] and went to the fire.  He got a couple of bags from Fordâ€™s house to attack the fire.

George Lockyer & E.F. Lockyer both had an interest in the paddock, but neither could help explain the fire.  H. Lockyer corroborated the two previous witnesses.

P.L. Killicoat believed the substance found near the source of the fire was phosphorised pollard.

R. Hunt agreed.

Verdict: The fire was started by phosphorised pollard wilfully and maliciously placed by person or persons unknown.
