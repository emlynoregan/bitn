Burra Town Council, Monday night

Sir Frederick Holder wrote about the idea of a new post office for Kooringa.  He was not encouraged to hope for a new building that would be a credit to the town.  He thought it might be just as well to seek a complete renovation rather than an entirely new building.

The rates were set at General 11d, Health 5d and Park Lands 1d.

The Waterworks will be asked to provide water to the public at Aberdeen free of charge.

A petition for a new post office at Kooringa will be drawn up and someone will be employed to get it signed throughout the town.
