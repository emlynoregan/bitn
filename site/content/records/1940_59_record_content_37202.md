Weiss did so and they walked as far as the dam, when she could go no further.

They discussed his escape and eventually he agreed to carry her back to the house and to get a doctor.

After she suggested they could say it was an accident, he said he would shoot himself in the foot.

He bathed her wounds and then went to hide the rifle in some rabbit burrows, returning at about noon after an absence of about an hour.

While he was away witness found and loaded Mr Phillips’ shotgun and placed it in the bedroom next to hers – for her own protection.

Weiss left the second time after about five minutes.

She had first met Weiss through an advertisement in Madam Wu’s column in The Chronicle – ‘J----is a war widow with a baby, is fond of music and horse riding.’

When she left the house with Weiss he had not known she was shot, but when she told him he removed two fragments of metal from her body – before going back for her daughter, Marlene.

They had discussed the possibility of hiding in one of the disused houses in the vicinity.

The cross-examining counsel then sought to extract information about the background of Mattner’s relationship with Weiss and other matters dating from 1947.  Some questions were ruled inadmissible, but details reveal that she had agreed in 1947 to marry Weiss, but no date had been set and later she had told him she would not marry him.  The defence asked questions that implied Mattner had a somewhat dubious past and also that she suggested to Weiss that they concoct a story of accidental shooting at ‘Studholme’.  Mattner’s responses are not straightforward, but she also at times implies that she acted through fear.

The inquest continued on Thursday.

Mattner:

Weiss had never visited her at Phillips’ property until the fatal day.

After she and Weiss had parted at Parker’s property [in 1947] the next time she saw him was at Aberg’s Café in Burra.

She denied having obtained £5-10-0 from Weiss for a wedding dress.  She got 10 shillings for doing his laundry and £5 to buy sundry items for herself.  The wedding cake had been ordered, but no wedding date fixed.

On several occasions she had said Weiss was ‘weak in the head’ and he had tried to strangle her when they were returning home one night at Auburn.

She had broken off her engagement to Weiss in about November, having come to the decision suddenly.

No one knew that she contemplated marrying Lance Phillips.

MC Sparrow

Evidence corroborated Dr Heddle’s concerning the trip to ‘Studholme’ and the discoveries there.

Weiss had told him that he arrived at ‘Studholme’ at about 11.55 a.m. to see Miss Mattner and found her on a bed in an apparently distressed state.

He had bathed her wounds.

After that he had gone outside with the intention of coming to Burra.

A shot was fired from the north side of the shed and went through his boot.

He then hopped on his bike and pedalled as fast as possible towards Burra, getting a lift along the way.

He admitted seeing ‘a chap lying face down in a doorway and there was blood all over the place.’

He had not mentioned this body to anyone because it had slipped his memory.

He denied firing a shot at either Lance Phillips or Miss Mattner.

He denied hiding the rifle in a rabbit hole.

He admitted there were powder marks around the bullet hole in his boot.

He denied having arranged with Miss Mattner to say somebody else had been there.

Witness then arrested Weiss for the murder of Lance Phillips.

Witness then returned to ‘Studholme’ and found the rifle hidden in a rabbit burrow.

On further questioning Weiss admitted it was his rifle and that it was the one that he had fired and killed Lance Phillips.

Weiss also admitted that he had put a bullet through his foot after shooting Lance Phillips and then retrieving his bike and was on the road when he met Bob Phillips.

MC France gave evidence that corroborated that of MC Sparrow.

When Weiss had volunteered to tell them everything, Weiss then dictated a statement (taken down by MC Wiecks) in his own words and had signed it after it had been read over to him.  MC France then read Weiss’s statement.

He did not mean to shoot anyone.  It was pointing at Lance and Weiss had the gun on his hip and it went off in the excitement.  He said June said she would protect him in court and if June had told him before that she had not been married and had been in gaol he would have dumped her straight away.

The accused refused to answer any questions on the grounds that his replies might incriminate him in any subsequent proceedings taken against him.

[The report runs to some 7½ columns.]
