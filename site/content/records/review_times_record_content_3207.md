Burra Community Library

Historic furniture will be a feature of the local and SA history collection to be housed in the new mezzanine floor of the library.  Librarian Mr Colin Fidock said the new floor would be added in the BCS book storage and resource room, which has a very high ceiling.  It would add about 9 square metres of floor space and feature an elegant wooden balustrade.  Much of the material used in Mr Ian Auhl’s research will be housed in a cedar cupboard from the original DC office.  There is also an old headmaster’s desk, which will be used as a newspaper reading desk.  Some original shelving from the Institute Library will be used to house the collection.  Tables will be made from original mine timbers.  It was hoped work on the mezzanine would start next month.
