John Allen and Lisle Pearce announced their candidacy for West Ward.  Mr Pearce’s policy included more fire plugs, renovation of the Kangaroo St Bridge, another light between Lewis’s and the Hospital and better kerbs and footpaths in front of newly erected houses.  He objected to the rubbish dump under the Black Bridge.
