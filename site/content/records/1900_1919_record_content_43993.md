Burra Racing Club AGM last Friday at the Liberal Union rooms.  The club was in debt £128-9-6 and had a signed guarantee for £125. The President, Mr A.G. Gebhardt said the debt was due to a bad year last year combined with costly improvements.  This year £20 would get the track in order and with reduced stakes a good part of the debt might be wiped out and the rest in 1916.  The secretary has applied for the 3rd Saturday in January for a meeting.  It was agreed to go ahead with the meeting.  The Hon. J. Lewis was re-elected Patron and A.G. Gebhardt was re-elected President.  Mr Treloar tendered his resignation as Secretary as he was not greatly interested in the sport and they needed someone with a keener interest and furthermore he was likely to be absent from the town in January.  The position will be advertised at £20 p.a.  The stakes were fixed at £225.
