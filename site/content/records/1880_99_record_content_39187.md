The Editorial sums up the background to the court case to be heard 10 December between the Corporation and Messrs Bagot, Shakes and Lewis who are being sued for obstructing a watercourse.  Almost 12 months ago Mr (then Cr) Hardy noticed damage was being done to the property of ratepayers by a watercourse which empties into Burra Creek after running through property belonging to Bagot, Shakes & Lewis.  This creek was blocked.  The owners were served with notice to remove the obstruction.  They did not comply and a man was sent by the Council to do the work.  Bagot, Shakes & Lewis then threatened to sue the man unless the stuff was put back.  The Council decided to support Mr John Jenkins, the dayman in question.  At the last minute Bagot, shakes & Lewis withdrew the threat and it was thought the matter was settled.  Later the watercourse was again obstructed and again the Council, on behalf of ratepayers, on legal advice, decided to claim their right to the watercourse in question and a hearing is set for tomorrow.  Last Saturday Mr John Lewis JP made certain suggestions as to an out-of-court settlement and Council met on Saturday afternoon in special meeting to consider the matter.  The Council decided to proceed with the case.  There is an important question at stake and considering there are several other watercourses in the Corporation it needs resolution.
