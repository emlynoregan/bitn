Burra Town Council

A letter from C. Grow offering to accept £100 for 156 feet of land in connection with the Black Bridge: the present road to become his property.  Not accepted.

[This doesn’t sound right.  Logically it should refer to Deadman’s Bridge on Ayers St.]

Burra Bowling Club applied for 60’ of land on the east side of the green – the idea being to plant trees there.  They were granted a 21-year lease at a peppercorn rent, from the southern boundary of the Council Depot block to the bridge.

The Town Clerk was granted 10/- a week for doing the work of the Inspector during the latter’s illness.

Cr McBride called for the Town Clerk’s duties to be defined, as he thought it was a full-time job, but it appeared he was there only two days.

Mr Grow is to be interviewed and asked for the option for one month at £50 of the land offered by him.
