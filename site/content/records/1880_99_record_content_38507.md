Editorial supporting a Constitutional Amendment to have half of the Legislative Council retire every three years.  (At the time 8 of the 24 retired every three years.)  This, said the writer, might remove such fossils as Messrs Tomkinson, Warren, Bosworth, Bright and Baker. It also provides for a Minister of Agriculture and Labour.

2nd Leader on Prospecting for Minerals.

Government aid has been cut from £20,000 to £10,000: a bad decision.

3rd Leader on the possibility that Mr Ellis Newton’s concert in aid of a widow was a sham: at least so far the widow has not been made known.

4th Leader on Noxious Weeds: the need to proclaim star thistle a noxious weed under its botanical name in order to remove ambiguity.

Burra Town Council has decided to construct a culvert across the road at Henderson’s Corner.

St Joseph’s Art Union was drawn last Saturday afternoon.  Mr W.H. Hardy of this office acted as scrutineer by invitation.
