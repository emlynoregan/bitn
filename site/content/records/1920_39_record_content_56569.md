Burra Town Council, 17 June

The Mayor and Crs J.A. Riggs, Jennison & Dow were all returned unopposed.

The Railway Department advises it is intended to repair the lower road at the station and asks the Council to give a price for the work.

The Council did not have the necessary plant and so outside prices were being obtained and the Council would not interfere in the matter.

A letter of condolence will be sent to Mrs Builder on the death of Mr Thomas Builder.

[There was considerable discussion over road work and how it was allocated to various people.]
