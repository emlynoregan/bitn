R.J. Phillips writes to the editor concerning the greening of Burra.

Efforts to green Burra raise some concerns.  These activities are undertaken with little or no research into what species are indigenous to Burra.  Early descriptions of the area prior to settlement indicate that the dominant species was Lamandra dura (crin grass) and that the Burra-Terowie district was a natural grassland, with trees, red gum, blue gum and casuarinas restricted to creeks and small pockets in the hills.  As for beautifying the creek, that is all well and good, but these well-intentioned people should understand that they are destroying Burra’s heritage in so far that dugouts stretched along the creek banks for eight miles south towards Princess Royal.  Apart from the Mitchell Flat area, evidence of these dwellings is hard to find due to human interference.  I believe that in a heritage town ‘tree planting on a mass scale should only occur after considered planning and consultation with the appropriate heritage bodies.
