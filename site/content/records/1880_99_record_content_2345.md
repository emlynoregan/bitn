Editorial on the Approaching Elections.

2nd leader on Municipal Matters.

The 1st thing to do is to fix the salaries for the year.

An allowance for the Mayor should be considered.  He has so far had no consideration for expenses.

The rates have previously been 1/- for the general rate and 3d for the health rate.  A 1/- rate gives only £280 for each ward after allowing for the police moiety and the present ward surplus expenditure.  Middle Ward has the advantage of a special grant of £400 for the main roan past the P.O. and Institute.
