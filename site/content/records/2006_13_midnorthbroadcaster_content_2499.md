Jailhouse Rock numbers halved this year.  Committee member Sue Ryan said this could be attributed to the change of date this year because the National Motor Museum snatched the usual date for its Rock and Roll Rendezvous.  She expected the 10th event in 2008, on the usual date, to see a revival in numbers.  It would also move from the Gaol to the Town Hall in 2008, with a better floor, better lighting and greater opportunity to wear more glamourous shoes and outfits.  [Photo.]
