Burra Bowling Club.

A meeting last Thursday decided to form a bowling club.  Mr C.D. Wilkinson convened the meeting.  He said the idea had been discussed earlier, but shelved because of the war.  Mr A.W. Gebhardt had given them an option on a piece of land adjacent to the Council Depot [Thames St].  If the Council would grant a piece of their ground this would make an ideal site c. 150’ square.  Mr Gebhardt said they would need at least 50 members at £3-3-0 a year to maintain a green.  Six rinks, a well, a pump etc. would be needed and would require £500 for initial expenses.  A committee was appointed to report on possible sites and get estimates etc.

Mr McLaren suggested Paxton Square.

Mr Chambers suggested opposite the school on the creek bank where there were already tennis courts.
