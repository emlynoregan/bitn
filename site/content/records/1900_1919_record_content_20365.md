Accident.  Charley Preiss fell asleep on his way to Baldina last Friday and the horses fell into the deep creek on the turn towards Barker’s.  One horse fell on top of another one and the wagon became jammed in the creek and needed seven or eight horses to pull it out.  A third horse escaped and went home.  The animals in the creek were both injured and one is not expected to recover.

[The article makes no mention of injury to Charley or to his fate!]
