Burra Mine.

An attempt is being made to float a company to buy this property.  The mine closed in 1877 due to the low price of copper, but now operations would be cheaper, fuel is cheaper and so is cartage, so it is believed the mine would be profitable.  On closure in 1877 the company had just proved the existence of rich sulphide ore some 300’ below the deepest point at which oxidised ore was found, but there was no capital for the dead work.  It is estimated a working capital of at least £60,000 would be needed.  The tailings and ore material are estimated at from 170,000 to 440,000 tons and assay at 0.86 to 2.72% copper.  Mr Greenway, manager of Broken Hill Propriety Block 14 Co. says some of these may yield a profit of 2/- to 3/- a ton and other 4/- to 5/- per ton.  Capital of the new company will comprise £120,000 in £1 shares.  T.B. Gall has a sample of carbonate ore said to come from tributers to the east of the old open cut at 60’ and estimated to assay at 40-50% copper.  Sulphides have been got from Morphett’s Shaft and carbonate ore at 3% is exposed around the open cut and this can be treated the same way as the tailings.  (From an article in The Advertiser.)  [This new company was to become the Burra Burra Copper Co.]
