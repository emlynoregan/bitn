Water Supply. There is a summary of the recent moves to get a water supply. The permission of the Yorke's Peninsula Mining Co. has at last been obtained to use the water from the Bon Accord Mine. The supply will extend from the Bon Accord to a point about opposite Ridgway's store, where a trough and standpipe have already been erected. The editor clearly thought that had the Corporation backed the move adequately there should have been a water supply for the whole town.

There has been talk of laying a main from the spring at the wool wash in Kooringa into Market Square, but nothing has yet come of it. No real scheme for a permanent water supply has come from the last Corporation meeting except for an idea of extending the line from Ridgway's to Market Square. So Kooringa is Dow worse off than Aberdeen, which also has some surface water in the creek as a result of last Saturday's rain.
