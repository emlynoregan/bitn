Burra Bowling & Croquet Club’s opening of the season took place on Saturday 25 October, the 10th anniversary of the opening of the clubs.  The Bowling Club had not progressed as it should have.  They needed more members, which made it financially backward and decreased its social function.  The annual subscription for this year was decreased from £4-4-0 to £3-3-0 and new members were needed to counter that.  Last season they had won back the Kapunda-Burra Cup, but had lost the Clare-Burra Cup.  The Mayor then opened the season.  Mrs Harold Tiver as President of the Croquet Club opened the green for croquet.
