There was a contract let for £35 
The land for the new bridge approaches would cost £175 
Legal and other fees related to the bridge work would add £125 
Earthwork for the bridge, £50 
Money owed to the cemetery account £230 
Total £662 
With an income of c. £850 necessary expenses and salaries would leave £600 ‘so there would not be a very large balance to spend’ 
A mortuary chapel should be built at the cemetery. 
He favoured finding someone who could combine the jobs of Town Clerk, Surveyor, & Inspector and so save some of the salary costs. The 3d rate for sanitary purposes was a farce. It raised £150 which was spent: £50 to the inspector, £10 for the Secretary and £80 to the Scavenger and the latter produced a result ‘not equal to the expenditure.’ More was required than the removal of household refuse. 
He hoped water supply arrangements could be made to remove the antagonism between the north and south end of the town. He believed it had been decided to erect two standpipes in Kooringa — one in Market Square and one in Paxton Square. Some parts of town had a well in almost every backyard and did not require a scheme that would impose a general rate that would be unfair to those who did not use the water. Any citizen on the mains should be entitled to be connected at his own cost and to pay for water received. He also complained about a misleading flier circulated by his opponent or his supporters in which he was accused of being in town only ‘a year or two’ — actually it was almost 3½ years. He would ignore the comments about competence and experience. He was accused of always opposing the Council — he had opposed the original Council: not the one headed by Mr Lipsett. He was said to be promoted by a clique, of whom Messrs Drew & Dawson were considered the heads, but 104 persons had signed the requisition asking him to stand — a rather large ‘clique’. He didn’t have, the document claimed, one hour a month for the School Board of Advice. This was true because it was a waste of time — on it Mr Ridgway lived at Brighton and was rarely there, Mr Lipsett was Lane, Mr Bath was Lane & Mr Lane was Lane — so it was all Lane. He had never said, as was claimed, that the workingman would vote for Lipsett and respectable people would be on his side.
