W.R. Ridgway explained why the meeting was not on Tuesday as called by the mayor - too short notice. Then moved `That in the event of the Government giving a favourable reply, a memorial be prepared and forwarded to Messrs Rees and Rounsevell for presentation to the Government, urging them to take steps to have water mains laid on from the Bon Accord Shaft, via Morehead Street, to the Bank of Australasia; thence southward as far as Opie's Hotel and northward as far as the White Hart Hotel, with a view to further extension when considered necessary and practicable.' W. Woollacott wanted Kooringa included.
