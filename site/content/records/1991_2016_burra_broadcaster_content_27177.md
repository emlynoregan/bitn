BCS has a current Five Year Asset Management Plan that is costed at $975,800 to achieve benchmarks.  The 2000-01 year had no funding and the 2001-02 year has $51,170 allotted.  The fears of many schools in the Partnership 21 program are that at the rate of funding allocations for years 3, 4 and 5 will never eventuate.  Minister Buckby has indicated only 5% of work listed for repairs and maintenance has been funded for this financial year.
