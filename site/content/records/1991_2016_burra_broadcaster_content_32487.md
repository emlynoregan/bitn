Friends of Burra Parks held an orientation day last weekend to look at future projects in both Redbanks and Caroona Conservation Parks.  About 30 members attended at Redbanks.  Here the priority project is revegetation of the old oval site for which a grant of $8,000 has been obtained.  Members later moved on to Caroona Conservation Park.
