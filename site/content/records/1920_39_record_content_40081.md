The Council began with a debit of £108 and would end with one of £117.  To keep the same income the rate for 1932 would need to be 3/-.  He was not suggesting that this be the rate.  Overheads take about £1,200 p.a.  There was no room he felt for further economies.

The Mayor approved of a Mr Butler suggestion that 75% of money spent on rations should go to the Council who would then add the 25% and let the men work for the value.

He had been told a day or two ago that Mongolata would get a battery and £500 was placed on the estimates for the working of Mongolata.

Cr Jennison thanked ratepayers for his unopposed re-election.

Cr Bevan thanked ratepayers for his re-election during the year.

Cr Pearce was still going on about the Mayor’s allowance, saying the Mayor had said he would not accept it.

The Mayor said he had undertaken if it were paid to spend it on charity.

Cr Riggs couldn’t see how they were to carry on with the present assessment.

Answering a question the Mayor thought the Council was getting a fair deal on electric lighting, but agreed that as a householder he thought the charge for electricity was too high.

(It was 1/3 a unit in Burra compared with 7d a unit in Adelaide.)
