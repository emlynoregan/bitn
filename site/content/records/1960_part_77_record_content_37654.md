Burra Rural Supplies opened in Morehead Street Burra North on Friday and about 200 people came to the launch.  It is a joint venture of I.T. & M.L. Allen and M.T. & I.J. Pettet.  The Bulk Store proved to be a most satisfactory place for Mr I. Allen to explain the 1968 catalogue of products and services.  The Mobil Agency and carrying service previously run by J.L. Allen & Son will continue under Burra Rural Supplies.  New services will be Bulk Super Spreading, Horwood Bagshaw Machinery franchise and agencies for Portagas and Charlicks Feeds (bulk or bagged).  Light refreshments were provided at the opening.
