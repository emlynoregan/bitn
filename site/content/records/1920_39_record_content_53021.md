Finch Bros. Mullaby Rodeo rough riders gave a great performance at Victoria Park on Saturday afternoon.  The lads are sons of Walter Finch of Leighton and late of Mullaby.  Two horses, ‘Jimmy’ & ‘The Terror’ lived up to their reputations.  The brothers Reg [23], Ken [21] & Jack [19] gave some wonderful exhibitions of riding skills.  The wild weather unfortunately reduced attendance.  The donkeys provided much amusement and pleasure, especially for the small fry.  Master Spencer Finch [12] showed great pluck at steer riding, as did Jack Rowe [27].  Ken Finch gave a great exhibition of buckjumping.
