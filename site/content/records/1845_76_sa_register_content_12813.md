Kooringa News

An accident occurred at the Mine recently.  A slip of earth buried one of the men, but he was quickly rescued and, though severely bruised, is now doing well.

In another accident a boy was severely gashed on the head when a large screen used in screening ore fell on him.  The wound proved severe, but not dangerous.

The new Bible Christian Chapel, which is being built to accommodate the large numbers who crowd the old chapel, is progressing rapidly under the supervision of Mr Burgoyne, the contractor.

In the Kooringa Wesleyan Chapel Mr James Pearce will soon complete the erection of a fine gallery to accommodate the increased congregation.

At the Bon Accord Mine Mr Brown of the firm of English & Brown is bringing the building there to completion.  The offices are being covered in.  The engine-house is ready to receive the engine and the 60 ft chimney has reached the height of 36 ft.

There are accounts from the north of the cattle sent up to the new country.  One is of a mob of 200 at the Lake from 700 that started out.  Messrs Humphreys and Barker are at Termination Hill. [Just west of Lyndhurst.]  They are waiting with their mob for rain to get over the remaining 80 miles.
