Burra Racing Club.  Last week the Club’s spring meeting drew the largest crowd to be seen at a Burra Race Meeting.  Gate receipts were a record £305 and to this must be added membership fees.  It was raining in Adelaide in the morning and this extended to Marrabel, but largely held off in Burra until the end of the day.  Thirty-one bookmakers attended.  CWA ladies provided luncheon and took £162.  The Handicap Novice had so many entries it had to be run in two divisions and full prize money was paid to each.  Total prize money was £490 plus a 30 guinea trophy and a 20 guinea trophy.  The £100 LV Burra Handicap went to Sandalwood owned by Hedley Schoff of Gawler.
