It was carried unanimously.

Mr Harris then moved: ‘That a memorial, founded on the foregoing resolutions, be prepared and forwarded to the Lieutenant-Governor, and advertised in the newspapers, and that a subscription be entered into to defray the necessary expenses.’  Seconded by Mr Brannon and carried without dissent.

A vote of thanks to Mr Lang was carried by acclamation.  Mr Burgess observed that had the meeting been called for 6 p.m. instead of 3 p.m. it would have been necessary to adjourn to the open air.
