Court.

There is a 2½ column report on a case in which Develaing sued Kelly for £6-8-0 for agistment of stock and £10 damages for breaking and entering his paddock and damage to fencing by cattle.

Kelly counter-sued for £19-19-0 for libel following a notice in the Burra Record which he claimed implied that he was unable and unwilling to pay his just debts.  In the end Develaing won £4-1-0, but had to pay costs and the counterclaim was dismissed.
