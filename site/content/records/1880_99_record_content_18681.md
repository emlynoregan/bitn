Guarantors of Burra Waterworks Meeting in the Council Chamber last Tuesday.  12 plus the Council were present.  No redress seems obtainable so the Waterworks Committee called the guarantors together to bring the utmost pressure on the Commissioner of Public Works in the interests of the town by presenting a memorial incorporating the following: -

At the time the scheme was initiated there was no idea of its present size.

Up to the time the reservoir was built only 98 had guaranteed to take water, but at present 208 are supplied.

One reason for the increase is the concession the late Commissioner made in allowing connection to mains and the cost of meters to be charged to the capital account.  (For which the late Mayor and Council and the District Member, Mr Cockburn, are to be thanked)

That expansion involved an expansion in the means of supply.

The power of the engine and pump ordered is 2,700 gallons per hour, which is ‘by a curious process of arithmetic made 8,000 gallons per hour with a second pump.

These calculations are doubtless made based on the machinery working to capacity.  We believe it is ‘not only unwise, wasteful, and extravagant, but positively unsafe to habitually drive machinery at its utmost tension.’  It is more economical to drive a larger engine at its nominal power.

We are anxious that machinery of a larger capacity should be substituted for that ordered without casting the slightest reflection on the ability of the Hydraulic Engineer, who cannot be blamed for eventualities of which he had no knowledge.

If part of the road is appropriated for the engine etc. it will be necessary to have room for firewood and we fail to see any possible reason against the purchase of a small piece of land for that purpose.

The mere statement of cost of works in a general way without proper details is not at all satisfactory to your memorialists who consider they are entitled to know what they are paying interest for, ‘more especially as in the account sent to the Council there are some obvious overcharges.’

Cr Ridgway as Chairman of the Waterworks Committee felt it was his place to move the adoption of the memorial, but first corrected a mistake in his speech in Council.  The interest they were being charged was calculated correctly as they were being charged 5% on the cost of the services.

As for the capital cost.  It was stated in a letter from A.P. Lungley that the old works had cost £912 complete, but in fact the records show that £832 had been granted for the work of which £65 was returned unexpended.  The Council was only leasing part of the old works - 30 chains of 3” main, 10 chains of 2” main, 2 water troughs, 1 standpipe, and 15 meters.  The only Government cost was for the materials; the consumers having paid for the labour.  The whole cost to the government could not have exceeded £250.

Cr West said there were three vital points in the memorial: -

A larger engine would run on half the fuel for half the time.

Details of the costs were essential.  The costs cited were very much above the original estimate and payable interest was up by 75%.

They had been charged extravagant prices for almost everything.

Dr Brummitt did not agree with the memorial.  In the memorial much was made of details while the chief point was left to last.  It was infinitely the most important and should be the first point.  It was a long and hard battle to get a promise from the Commissioner of Public Works, Mr Playford that the materials would be charged at cost.  If the capital account included a profit of 75% the Council would have been better off foregoing the Government’s low % interest rate and doing the work on borrowed money itself, at a higher rate of interest.  The promise was in a letter to Dr Cockburn and was conveyed to the Hydraulic Engineer.  The Hydraulic Engineer, when sending the cost particulars to Council, had written at the bottom: ‘The above are cost prices, Adelaide’.  This is remarkable when the portion of the Public Works Department signed by him proved that it was not so.

Dr Cockburn was prepared to defeat this attempt to break the promise given and they only need ask and they were sure to have justice and a considerably reduced total on which to pay interest.

When he had written his report as Mayor last year he had written for the cost to date and an estimate for the completion of the whole then fell a long way short of £3,000 at that stage.  If at the end of November last it was under £3,000 how could it have reached £5,652 by the end of December?

As for the first item about the engine.  He had asked Mr Jobson whose opinion was respected and he said it was not so much the engine as another pump and the engine was quite able to work two pumps, so there was really no difficulty at all.  Jobson suggested the Hydraulic Engineer be asked to allow the old pump to remain with the new until another was obtained if it proved necessary.  If the two pumps could raise 5,000 gallons per hour and the tank held 30,000 gallons and was never emptied, the engine would be sufficient.  As to the land - it was desirable, but not worth making a point of.

The Mayor said it was not whether the engine could do the job, but whether the larger would not be cheaper.

The Mayor said: -

12 horsepower pump at 45 lb/in2 cost £84-16-6

6 horsepower pump at 60 lb/in2 cost £140-8-0

Mr Holder said he thought the Council deserved thanks for their efforts to come to best terms with the Hydraulic Engineer’s Department and he desired to help them as far as possible, but he was very much disappointed with the memorial as read.
