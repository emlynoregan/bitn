St Mary’s Patronal Festival was observed on Sunday.  Rev. G.D. Sibly was the preacher and Dr J.V. Peters played the organ for the sung Eucharist.  Over 250 people attended the evening service, which was followed by an organ recital by Dr Peters.  The recital was a balanced selection of music by Bach, Buxtehude, Stanley, Purcell and Clérambault:	Bach	Toccata & Fugue in D Minor

John Stanley	Suite

Clérambault	Dialogue for Organ

Bach	Fugue in B Minor

The Rector was able to announce that the cost of the new stop has been raised.  The stop was made good use of in the Suite by John Stanley.
