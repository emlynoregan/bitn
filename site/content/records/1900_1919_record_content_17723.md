Salvation Army.  The annual meeting regarding social work was held on Monday night and drew few people due to the rough weather.  Adjutant Smith gave the address on the work of the Prison Gate Brigade and Lieut. Crocker spoke on the Old Menâ€™s Home at Pakenham, Victoria.  E.W. Crewes occupied the chair.  Offerings were very satisfactory.
