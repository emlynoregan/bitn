Editorial on the Opening of the 14th SA Parliament.

There is little new offered by the Government.

There is a proposal for a railway from Herrgott Springs to Kopperamanna [On the Birdsville Track.] and another from Tailem Bend to Wow Wow Plains [NE of Coonalpyn.]

Woman’s suffrage will be considered –

‘We are of the opinion . . . it will be a step in the wrong direction.’

‘Ninety-nine out of every hundred would exercise her franchise in precisely the same direction as her husband, and in this case we would only have a larger electors’ roll with the same results.’
