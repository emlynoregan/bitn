Public Meeting re Market Square

The Mayor S. Burns presided over the meeting and said the Council had decided to provide a suitable site in Market Square of about 50 ft in the centre of the square and to ask the assistance of the whole town and district.  He said if they raised about £150 they could erect a worthy enclosure.  Cr Wise moved ‘That in the opinion of this meeting it is desirable to erect a suitable enclosure in Market Square in memory of the late King Edward VII.’  This was seconded by Mr C.A. Fuss and carried.
