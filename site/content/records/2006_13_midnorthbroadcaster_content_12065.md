Burra Hospital

A number of questions and concerns were raised at the LNHAC Community Forum in Burra on Monday.    As well as HAC members the meeting was attended by Goyder Council CEO John Brak and by Dr Lakman Fernando.  Mr Gwynn-Jones welcomed those present.  Great concern was expressed about the amount of time it has taken to see the question of the absence of a credentialed Doctor for accidents and emergencies at Burra Hospital resolved.  The lack of any evidence of progress only increased concerns.  Mr Gwynn-Jones assured the forum that every effort has been made to try to resolve the matter.  His understanding was that the unanimous decision to withdraw visiting privileges was made by a peer group of eight doctors.  Dr Fernando claimed there was ‘no review …They just came and did work with the nurses.’

Questions from the floor suggested many could not see why Country health SA ‘can’t sort it out’.

The HAC was disappointed that Goyder Council had not expressed any concern.  The HAC could not get the Council to write a letter to say they were concerned.

The transfer of the Hospital ownership to LNHAC concerned other people and prompted the question:

‘Could Burra lose its hospital?’

‘Shoot me if this hospital is closed in the near future,’ replied Mr Gwynne-Jones.

The doctors have to go through their appeal process and we have to keep trying to get a doctor into our hospital as best as we can.   HAC has written to the Rural Doctors Agency [to supply an interim doctor] but indications are that sourcing a doctor for Burra is a low probability.

Near the end of the meeting Dr Fernando said he had arranged for a doctor to come from overseas.  The new doctor would work alongside Dr Fernando & Dr Dissanayake in the Burra Medical Centre and in the emergency service, initially, until Dr Dissanayake’s restriction is resolved.  Once the appeal process is finished he said all three doctors would like to practice in Burra.

The future planning of health services in the local area has been brought to the fore by the group of concerned Burra & District Residents regarding the credentialing of overseas trained doctors. (OTDs)

This follows complaints that were made, which were referred to and heard by Country Health SA and Scope of Clinical Practice Advisory Committee and the decision to revoke Dr Dissanayake’s attending rights at accidents and emergencies at Burra Hospital.

It is understood Dr Dissanayake was initially credentialed to attend accidents and emergencies and continued to do so until April 2010.  Since then accidents and emergencies have been attended by SA Ambulance, triage nurses at he Burra Hospital and attending doctors from Clare.

Group spokesperson Helen Szuty said this has had a profound effect on the community.  Confidence in Dr Dissanayake has naturally diminished and many patients are now consulting doctors in Clare.  This has other results in that do shopping and seek other service while there.  It is natural that people feel concerned for the future of the hospital in the absence of any satisfactory solution to this problem.  The problem is not unique to Burra and the group has successfully sought to have the issue included in the terms of reference for a proposed inquiry by the Social Development Committee of the SA Parliament.  (A proposal to be debated in SA Parliament today, 23 March.)

[The terms of reference are then stated.]

The group urges community members and the LNHAC to make a submission to the Inquiry in an effort to resolve the current situation.
