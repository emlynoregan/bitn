Craig Williamsâ€™ property on Braefoot Road near Leighton was struck by a localised storm event last Thursday.  Roofing iron was torn from a stone barn and guttering lifted up and draped like a ribbon around a TV tower.  The estimated wind speed was 110-130 km per hour from damage inflicted on buildings and trees, but Senior Meteorologist with SA Severe Weather Section, Duncan Tippins said that without seeing the site it was not clear whether the event was a small tornado of a downburst.
