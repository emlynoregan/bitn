Burra High School.  The Concert, Break-up and Prize Giving was conducted by Miss Millar at St Mary’s Schoolroom on 23 December.  She reported a larger roll call than ever before.  Vera Fuss was the only student to never miss a school session in 1904, and Edith Bartholomaeus missed only ½ day.  Results are printed.  [Though it is not made explicit, the implication seems to be that Hazel Bartholomaeus was dux, though Edna Goode would have been in all likelihood, had she attended for more than six months.]  Miss Roach leaves the staff at the end of 1904 to be replaced by Miss Vera Wilkinson.  Miss Sangster will continue.  The school picnic was at Gum Creek Station last Saturday, thanks to Mr & Mrs John Bowman.  In winter the school bazaar raised £22-8-0 for the New Guinea Mission.  The prize list is printed.  [Vera Fuss getting the prize for attendance.]
