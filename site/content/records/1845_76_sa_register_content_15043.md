Port Adelaide Smelting Works

The furnaces of the new smelting works erected for the English & Australian Copper Co. at Port Adelaide were lit on Saturday 2 November for the first time.  At 3 p.m. some 30-40 people were present when Mr Hamilton set fire to the No. 1 furnace and the visitors set light to the other seven.  Captain John Hart proposed the success of the venture, which was toasted in champagne.  Mr Malliphant superintended the erection of the works by Messrs English & Brown.  Provisions have been made for the erection of three other buildings of similar dimensions.  The smoke from the furnaces is led to an immense chimney stack that rises 161 feet and can be seen from all parts of the plain and from far out to sea.  It rests on a concrete foundation 41 feet square atop deep piles driven into the ground.  It is 8 ft square at the top.  The first 12 feet are stone and the rest in brick. It is estimated that the stack and the connecting tunnel consumed some 300,000 bricks.  It has been found that the foundation has not subsided by more than four inches, and that evenly.  It is expected that in about a fortnight the furnaces will be charged.  In the future coal will be carried by tramway trucks directly from ships to the furnaces.
