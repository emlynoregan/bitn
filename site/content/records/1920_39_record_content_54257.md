Fire in Commercial Street in the early hours of Saturday 5 January

Fire broke out in Ken G. Wohling’s hairdressing shop.  Before it was discovered the fire had a complete hold on the shop and was threatening adjacent buildings.

Frank Pascoe dreamed he was being smothered and awoke to find his bedroom full of smoke.  He lives with his father R.D. Pascoe whose hairdressing shop and stationers and also his residence, a two storey building, is two doors from Wohling’s and is the fifth shop west of Drew Lane.

Starting from the lane the shops are:

Sara & Co. general merchants

Bowey & Montgomery’s fruit & cool drink shop

K.C. Wohling hairdresser

The Burra Record office

R.D. Pascoe & Sons hairdressers & stationers

Mrs E.F. Marston owns the first four of these.

Mr F. Pascoe threw on a few clothes, roused his father and rushed to the street where flames were licking the verandah of Wohling’s and had already set fire to the huge telephone pole on the footpath.  He ran to the nearby fire station and roused the man in charge Mr F. Spencer at 3.35 a.m.  The siren soon roused firemen and the town, though a stiff westerly wind meant many quite close to the blaze slept through the event.  Mr & Mrs Gordon Torr, staying at the Commercial Hotel were aroused by the noise of the fire opposite and Mrs C.J. Butler of the Bank of Australasia was aroused by the glare from it on their sleep-out, even with Mr Pascoe’s two storey premises in between.

The brigade was there by 3.45.  Fortunately there is a fire plug in front of Pascoe’s and another just opposite and the water pressure was good.  Firemen were assisted by Messrs Ron Burt, Ted Motherall & Fred Seaford, [and Harry Yon: see next issue] while M-C Robinson watched the crowd and rendered other assistance.   The buildings, though modernised are among the oldest in the town and are over 70 years old.  The old paling roofs were still under the later iron.  Partition walls were weatherboard packed thickly with sawdust and ceilings were wood covered with more than 6 inches of sawdust.  [See clarification re the walls in the next issue.] In less than 20 minutes the firemen, Will Lee, P.J. Byrne, H. Hill & F. Spencer were clearly winning, but the wind had driven the flames along the roofs and smoke was pouring from the eaves of Sara & Co.’s on the end of the row.  Water was forced under the iron roof of the shops adjoining Wohling’s.
