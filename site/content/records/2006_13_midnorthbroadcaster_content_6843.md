Judy Partington & Don Pfitzner, Eudunda Ward Councillors, writes to explain why they support the proposed sports complex.  They say that the business plan, which is available for the complex, shows that it is more economical to unite all services in the new centre than to try to upgrade the separate aging facilities, for which it is harder or impossible to attract grants.

Julie Schulz of Eudunda also writes on the Sports & Community Centre project urging people to look ahead and seize the opportunity to grow and develop and not to let this chance pass them by.
