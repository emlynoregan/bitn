The Playground.  The committee met on 29 April and after inspecting the site the majority favoured the main road side of the creek.  Messrs A.B. Riggs & J. Kellock have volunteered to level the ground.  The Sporting & Athletic Club has offered to erect a shelter shed.  The Seaside Committee has voted Â£50 and the offer from the merry-go-round proprietary was accepted.
