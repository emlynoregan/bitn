Mixture of small and large advertisements.  Many smaller advertisements of the classified variety.  Stock sales & public notices.

Page 3

A few larger advertisements mixed with news and large items of general information.

Page 4

Similar to page 3, but general information items feature large than local news.

In general a good deal to read, but not all of it local news.  Coverage of local items is somewhat inconsistent, but generally quite good.  Some minor local events seem to get a great deal of space while other items of local interest get little.
