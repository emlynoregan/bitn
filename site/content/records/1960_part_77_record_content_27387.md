Characteristics of the paper in 1965

A fair coverage for Burra, but a lot on outlying areas like Hallett, Spalding and Farrell Flat.

Page 1

Dominated by news, but this is by no means confined to Burra news.

Pages 2 & 3

Large advertisements and public notices and sales and these often extend to page 3.  There may be some news also on page 3.

Pages 4, 5 & 6

Half at least is advertising.  As far as news is concerned these pages are dominated by sports results.  Other prominent features are reports of Annual General Meetings of clubs and other organisations such as church organisations and the CWA along with some reports of their meetings.

Page 7

The ‘Cash Column’ is often here, though it sometimes appears elsewhere and shares space with other items typical of pages 4, 5 & 6.

Page 8

Advertising and a large section of 50 and 25 years ago in the paper, along with news from other districts.  The reports from past years can also wander onto other pages.

Pages 9 & 10

These extra pages sometimes appear and continue the style of pages 4, 5 & 6.

Supplements are not uncommon, but vary in size and are sometimes single-sided.
