Booborowie Farmers’ Meeting 7 February drew c. 240 to the Booborowie Hall to consider grievances.  Major items of discussion were:

The Debt Adjustment Act.

Land Tax assessments, which were way out of touch with current values – a reduction of 50% will be sought.

A.D. McDonald discussed the complex problems concerning wheat.  At the core of it is the fact that farmers are receiving c. 1/7 a bushel and the Federal Government’s promise of 3/- a bushel has been brushed aside.  The meeting called on the Federal Government to honour the 3/- a bushel promise.

The meeting condemned the increase in land tax, which for the present could not be paid and should not in any case be demanded before appeals were heard.
