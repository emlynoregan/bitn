Burra Swimming Pool

The committee has commissioned an engineer and architect to draw up plans for a pool 100ft x 30ft and intends to call tenders for its erection in the coming winter.  It will be from 3ft to 8ft deep and will also have a 30ft x 8ft wading pool 2ft deep.  At present they have £500 available and anticipate the remaining £250 needed will be forthcoming when the work begins.
