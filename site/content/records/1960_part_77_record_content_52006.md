Burra Bowling Club held its AGM.

President M.G. Stockman reported on the 1969-70 season.  The greens were in good shape thanks to greensman Chas. Dare.  The Club had two teams of twelve players in each of two divisions of Pennant Bowls.  The Easter Tournament had been a great success. Catering was done on site this year with an annex erected for the occasion by Dudley Jacka.  The present clubhouse is comfortable, but too small and there are moves to rebuild or enlarge it, subject to finance availability.  Brian Riggs was Club singles Champion for the season.
