In later years after the sale of the family’s farming and grazing land, travel became one of life’s pleasures and the fact that as a fami1y, we travelled around the world together during most of 1970s set the scene for many other trips by each of us. to various parts of Australia and the globe She made her last overseas trip at the age of 85, made all the more memorable for aging her elder daughter by some 100 years when she got lost in Singapore’s massive Changi Airport for an hour!

She was very well read, loved music, especially that termed Classical, and passed those loves on to us from an early age by constantly reading to us and introducing us to music, although our piano lessons didn’t bear much fruit!

Her wonderful sense of humour still surfaced even in quite recent times when there wasn’t a great deal to laugh about.  She had a great general knowledge and could answer a variety of Sale of the Century quiz questions with ease.  Her witty comments and sense of humour were almost legendary within the family even when age began to tell on her memory.

Perhaps owing to having lived through the Great Depression she liked to put things away in case they would come in useful “for school projects” or for “a rainy day”.  A large house made this habit a very easy one to nurture and judging by what she managed to keep for the projects and the rainy day, we can expect floods sometime in the near future!

Her life span of 91 years saw remarkable changes to the world into which she was born. Those years have seen a range of monarchs, governments, World Wars, and great social changes.  She happily embraced many of those changes which have ranged from the Edison waxed cylinders to compact discs and computers, from horse-drawn vehicles and primitive bi-planes to Jumbo Jets and manned space flights.  Her era spanned times of financial uncertainty to comfortable affluence for main people.  Through these nine decades she maintained a cheerful nature and disposition and even in the last few years when her quality of life declined markedly she rarely if ever complained and was polite to the end.  That she was still able to be in Burra and in our excellent Hospital, with its caring staff, would have meant a great deal to her.

Her death last Sunday morning came as a relief from the burden of a heavy load and we commend her to

God’s loving care.

Throughout her long life, she never lost her faith in His goodness.  We will constantly remember her for the wonderful person that she was and are grateful to be able to say that we are her daughters.

Mary and Ruth

Woollacott.
