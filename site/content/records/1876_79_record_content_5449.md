Dinner to the Ex-Mayor. A complimentary dinner was given for the Ex-Mayor on Monday night. Though a success, it was undoubtedly a party gathering.  Though there was an ‘earnest display of goodwill to the guest’ the meeting was ‘deeply scarred with virulent and excessive personal references of a character calculated to degrade the status of the persons taking part in them.’
