SA Census and Population

Census returns for 31 March 1855.

632 persons were estimated travelling or omitted for a total population of 85,821 on 31 March 1855.

Houses

Stone or brick	9,101

Wood	6,709

Other	3,087

There are 5,321 farmers and 5,105 agricultural labourers.  In many districts there are more masters than servants.

Religion

The numbers of the Church of England are acknowledged by the clergy to be merely nominal.

The large number of Lutherans is due to the large admixture of the German element.  In County Light for example there are 1,723 Lutherans in a population of 5,167.  A number of other districts are similar.

From June 1855 to December 1856:

17,688 males arrived and 5,537 departed.

10,399 females arrived and 2,949 departed.

But note that records of departures are defective.  Recorded figures suggest the SA population is now 105,322, but it is thought to be in the range 90,000 to 92,000.  One reason (among several) is that in the first two quarters of 1856 some 5,000 Chinese arrived on their way to Victoria, but their departures have not been recorded.

[The lengthy report then goes on to detail the demographic and social characteristics of the immigrants; their origins, literacy, occupations, etc.  Details of the Government migrant ships are given.  Of some interest is the length of the voyages, which ranged from 79 days to 132 days, with an average of 98½.  The costs of getting these people to the colony are also discussed.]
