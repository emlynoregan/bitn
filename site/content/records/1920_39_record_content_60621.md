Mongolata School.  Last year the Department promised a school by the start of the new school year.  At the time there were 13 children of school age on the field.  Now, due to the Departmentâ€™s tardiness, four have left to find schools elsewhere and the department now says a school is not warranted and that those at the field are being educated by correspondence.
