Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co.  Mr T.B. Gall, Chairman of Directors, says a new body of good grade milling ore has been struck in a drive going south from the open cut above water level – it has gone c. 30’ and a crosscut shows the lode 20’ wide the manage says.  It is believed to extend to Sander’s or over 300’.  It adds to the previously estimated 10,000 tons.  There is also ore available at the north end towards Beck’s.  It is thought that the installation of a plant now under offer will depend on the report of an expert.  (Article from the Advertiser.)
