Burra Town Council, 19 January

J.O. Critchley on behalf of himself and Messrs George & McHugh wrote stating they and the Premier intended to visit Burra shortly and that they were doing their best to see that Burra got its fair share of relief works funding.

The Mayor produced the statement that there was a loss of £1,000 p.a. on the town water supply.

Cr Pearce said it should lie on the table till next meeting.  The Public Works Committee had presented a big order.  In a private company 10% depreciation p.a. was allowed and if this had been done on the plant etc. the capital charges should have been written off.

The rate was reduced from 2/6 to 2/3 in the £.

Burra Electric Supply is to be asked to review the contract for street lights with a view to a reduction in charges.  Lighting cost £300-£400 p.a.  In view of the present situation the Council might make a cut.

Cr Pearce said the charge was for 45 lights at £6 p.a. and 9 larger ones at £7.  When acetylene was used the charge was about £6 per lamp for 20 lamps.

Mr Rosewall the Overseer was given one month’s notice then three month’s holiday on full pay.  He had 16 years service.  [John Andrew Rosewall was then 67.]

The Mayor said his age prevented their getting insurance cover for him.

On request of Bandmaster Murison a light will be placed in the rotunda (and the globe removed after each concert).

The road from Young St to the racecourse gate and Railway Terrace are to be tar dressed.

The main road west of the hospital is to be tarred.

Cr Bevan gave notice that he would move in future that Councillors move for works at the Council table; at present they have to come through the Public Works Committee.
