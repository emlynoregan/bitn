SES thanks those who donated old batteries and so helped in getting the funds to replace the radio stolen in January.

Burra Burra DC Chairman Graham Kellock issued his Christmas message:

1993 started as a rather trying year, with heavy unseasonal rains, which ruined crops and damaged the road network.  As the year went by roads were repaired, but this expense has set back the works budget.  Thanks are due to the volunteers who worked so hard on the night of the 25 January to save the town from more damage.  In May the Council elections produced just one change; Cr Kevin Wallis replaced Cr Bob Heath.

A major development this year has been the building of the new swimming pool.  This has proved very costly and tenders were higher than expected, but it has been made possible by a Federal Government grant of $100,000.  The high maintenance costs have prevented the re-opening of the old pool and the new one should open in February.  Council is a member of the Mid North Development Board and this aims to aid development and industry in the area.  Last Saturday saw the election of a Liberal State Government with a large swing.  I remind people that this Government will have to be reminded of promises made while in opposition regarding the sealing of the Spalding-Burra-Morgan Road.
