Characteristics of the paper in 1916.

Page 1.

Large advertisements usually fill the page, but from early in the year some news items etc. also appear.  The advertisements are mostly local.

Page 2.

Dominated by smaller advertisements, public notices, notices of sales and the like.  Editorial comment is rare.  News begins and there are usually between two and three columns of it.

Page 3.

A couple of large advertisements and then the rest is news. The news was dominated by war issues, especially the activities of local patriotic societies.

Page 4.

Smaller advertisements compete with a widely fluctuating amount of other material which varies generally from 2 to 4 columns, but sometimes vanishes.

Due to the war the quality of the paper is not very good, but the general newsprint is better that that used for the literary supplements, which are worse and by now are very brittle.

Coverage of local news seems to be quite detailed and the editorial position is very strongly behind the patriotic efforts as might be expected.  This was also very evident when the matter of the conscription referendum was being debated.  The paper strongly urged a YES vote.
