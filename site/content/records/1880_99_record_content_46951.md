Cr Parks agreed.

Cr Kitchen said he was absent last meeting and that the ‘minutes and the report does [sic] not appear to correspond’.

As Cr Watt explained the Town Clerk only takes down motions and a question or two and leaves out the discussion.

Cr Hardy sought to make a personal explanation and insisted the Record’s report was incorrect.

Cr Watt showed Hardy a clipping from the Kapunda Herald: ‘What about outside misrepresentation that you write?’

Cr Hardy: ‘How do you know what I write?’

Cr Watt: ‘Anyone can tell your writing.’

Cr Rabbich said the motions as put and seconded should be reported correctly and they did not appear to correspond with the report.

The Mayor said: ‘I am pleased . . . the reported left out some glaring statements which would have made the discussion ten times worse.’

Eventually the Mayor suppressed discussion and proceeded with business.

The Engineer-in-Chief wrote asking for the right for the ballast siding to cross necessary roads.

Cr Watt moved it be granted.  Cr Linkson opposed it unless the Railways Department agreed to fix gates at each crossing.  Adding another line at the Bon Accord crossing would increase the danger there.  The siding would in fact decrease employment by cutting out a number of teams currently employed.

Cr Rabbich said in compensation more men would be employed in the quarry.

Carried with only Linkson opposed.

Cr Linkson asked the Mayor if he was aware that Mr Queale was engaging single men from elsewhere when local men with families were unemployed.

The Mayor undertook to do what he could.

L. Grow asked to put two horses in the Avenue.  Denied – to protect the trees.

The Engineer-in-Chief wrote about a report of Council on the 5th instant in which his letter of 17 August was read and Cr Hardy stated it was false in nearly every particular and the Commissioner knew it.  The engineer enclosed an extract from a letter from A. Stodart which he said proved conclusively that from his own admission Stodart was reckless – he was warned by a porter who was attending to signals.

He calls on the Mayor to request Cr Hardy to either substantiate or withdraw his statements.

‘I neither write nor say that which is false, and Mr Hardy has made a most unwarrantable and malicious statement.’  The letter was received.

It was resolved that the assessment for 1893 be the same as for 1892.
