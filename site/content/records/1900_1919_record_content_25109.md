Aberdeen Post Office.  It was eventually decided that the expanded work of the Aberdeen Post Office required more room and as no new building was agreed on it was decided to move to a room at the Railway Stores.  The necessary transformation has been made by Mr G. Bartholomaeus.  Miss Natalie Sara is Post Mistress.  The telephone from Kooringa has been enclosed for privacy and alphabetically arranged pigeonholes have made collecting mail much more efficient.  Many have transferred their postal addresses from Kooringa as a result.
