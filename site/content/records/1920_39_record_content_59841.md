RSL held its AGM with a very good attendance.

Elected were: President, W.F. Pickering; Vice Presidents, G.S. Hawker & D.L. Redding; Treasurer, K.M. Drew & Secretary, G.H. Dow.

Information was given that Archie Nolan, injured in a motor cycle accident during an Anzac Sports Day race on 6 May last, was an invalid and had lost the use of one arm.  The branch resolved to set up a subscription list and to start it off with a Â£25 donation.
