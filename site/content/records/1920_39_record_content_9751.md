It Started about one mile south of Canowie, ran through some of W.E. Hannaford’s ‘The Bluff’ destroying 1,150 acres of grass and 75 acres of lucerne, 150 tons of lucerne hay, shearing sheds, motor sheds, stables and equipment, but his livestock, all vehicles and 75 acres of lucerne were saved.  The fire burnt a corner of Cappeedee Run before going on to Willalo where the heavy losses were sustained by T. Jeffery, K.P. Sawers, E. Glover, J. Madigan, J.P. Cousins, S. Brooks, B. Mannion, B.H. Henriks, J.N. & J.S. McInerney, F.C. Catt, James Murphy, F. Phillips, Mr Millard, Mr Guthrie & Mrs K. Phillips.  Homesteads were saved.  All feed on the stock road was burnt – the only commonage for dairy cattle.  From Booborowie to Copperhouse equipment was dragged into fallow or lucerne paddocks along with vehicles.  Fortunately rain fell a little after 5 p.m. and though it was not much it, with a wind change to a southerly, extinguished the fire.  [The report does not mention the loss of any houses.]

The correspondent from Hallett says the fire started from sparks from a chimney fire at the Canowie Post Office.  [Though the date given in that report is Christmas Eve] This report says it reached an area between South Booborowie and Spalding when the rain fell.
