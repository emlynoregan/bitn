Pte A. Kerin was given a social last Wednesday at the Institute.  Also present on leave were Drivers Lin & Charles Jesser from Port Darwin and brother-in-law Tom Allen of Murray Bridge and AC1 Mervyn Allen from Laverton.  T.H. Woollacott presided as Chair of the Burra Soldiers’ Welfare Committee.  G.S. Hawker represented the RSL as President of the Burra sub-branch, along with W.R. Lee and H.J.B. Jennison.  As well as farewelling Pte Kerin, the meeting was celebrating the Italian surrender in Libya and the fall of Benghazi.  Mr Hawker’s speech is printed.
