Redruth Wesleyan Church introduced the concept of the "Sociable"; a pleasant evening

A circle of chairs in the hall and a large table for games.

The older people sat and chatted and played ‘round games’

The younger undertook parlour croquet, looked at stereoscopes and kaleidoscopes and pictures etc.

Refreshments were served at 9.00 and they dispersed at 10.00
