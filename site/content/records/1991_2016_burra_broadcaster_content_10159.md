Neil Page, business development advisor with the Mid North Development Board has reported to the Council on the future or tourism in Burra – especially in the light of Council mergers.  He recommends that certain aspects of tourism operations be transferred to community hands (excluding Paxton Square Cottages and the Caravan Park).  An independent board should be established and not a Section 199 Committee.

Finance for the Board’s operations should be a mixture of:

Tourism operations including the passport.

Council grants

Membership fees

Mid North Development Board

The Board should be encouraged to pursue the use of volunteer staff, traineeships and other CES or DEET incentives for employment.
