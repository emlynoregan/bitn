Wheal Grenfell.  Last issue we said Mr Grenfell and party had discovered a lode of copper near Sod Hut.  Some 17 years ago Captain Killicoat discovered copper in the same locality and briefly worked the mine with some success.  The men who had worked for him also opened up some ground about 200 yards southeast of his shaft, but had not the capital to develop it.  The present party prospected on the west side of a watercourse running north from the shaft last mentioned.  On 7 May a lode about 20 yards from the old shaft was discovered.  A sample gave good results and a lease has now been obtained.  Shaft No. 2 has been started twenty yards west northwest of their first find.  In this they have found the lode mentioned last issue.  It contains some splendid ore.  We think the proprietors are justified in anticipating great results.
