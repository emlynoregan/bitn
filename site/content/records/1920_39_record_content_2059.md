Accident.  Last Friday on the Sod Hut Road the coupling on Drew & Crewesâ€™ van broke causing one of the horses to swerve around, capsizing the van and trapping the horse beneath.  The driver escaped injury and remarkably not only did the horse do so as well, but of the 500 dozen eggs in the van only about 20 dozen were broken.
