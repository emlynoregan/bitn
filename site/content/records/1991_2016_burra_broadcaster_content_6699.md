Letter.  Anthony Thorogood writes about gardening without water.  In planting some 6,000 shrubs and trees on his property in the past four years, he watered each once with about 10 litres of water and 75% have lived.  He claims the other 25% were killed by frost.  The answer is to plant trees and shrubs that suit the local soil conditions and require only the expected amount of rainfall â€“ in this area 350-450 mm.  450 mm will support red flowering blue gums, coral gums, wattles, white flowering tea trees, hakeas and purple and white hardenbergias and many more.
