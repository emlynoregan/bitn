22 December

The Mayor said his idea was they should request a special grant to cut down the bank and raise the road from the new church to the Commercial St Bridge.

Sir Henry Ayers had been asked about a recreation ground site and he asked that they put the request in writing.

The Commissioner of Public works has notified the Council that a gong would be placed at the Aberdeen railway crossing.

The police payment issue was discussed, but not resolved.
