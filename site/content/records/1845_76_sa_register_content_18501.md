Road to Kooringa

A public meeting was held at Burra Hotel on Friday evening 26 May to consider petitioning the Central Road Board to adopt the present line of road through Apoinga and Logan’s Gap in place of the proposed road known as the middle road.  80 to 100 attended with W.H. Challoner in the chair.

Mr Challoner outlined the purpose of the meeting and said the change proposed would be detrimental to all.  The memorial had been in circulation for one day and had already 500 signatures.

Captain Killicoat proposed that the memorial be adopted.  Thomas S. Porter seconded.

Mr Hansell spoke in support: in the early days when the country was open the teamsters had the choice of route and chose the present line of road as best.  It had a good foundation and 11 waterholes (not the 8 stated in the memorial).  The motion was carried unanimously.

Mr William Pearce moved a motion that the inhabitants of Kooringa would suffer a great injustice by the proposed change.  The proposal would shift the road two miles away from Kooringa and inhabitants who had expended great sums of money on their properties would lose as the traffic went away from the town.  Also it would be difficult to go over Porter’s Hill on the middle road.  The road would have to be made all the way from Springbank.  Mr Moody seconded and Mr Williams spoke in support.  The motion was carried unanimously.

Mr John Kent proposed the memorial be sent to the Board immediately.  This too was carried.

[The text of the memorial is then printed.]
