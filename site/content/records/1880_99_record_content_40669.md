The Burra Institute Committee on 9 March agreed to the construction of a urinal in a similar place in the Avenue and to pay one-third the cost as the Council suggested.  Also to construct a passage through the lodge room by putting up a suitable stone wall and erecting a verandah from the present lodge door to the escape door in the hall.
