Kooringa Businesses are surviving better than many had expected, given the stoppage of the Mine.  Although business has been dull, it is not as dull as feared.  It has been a surprise that so many remain in the town after the mine stoppage.  The answer seems to lie in the role of Kooringa as the entrepot for the vast areas to the north and northeast.  Kooringa is the source of supplies for this area, extending into NSW.  Many of the minersâ€™ cottages are occupied by the familles of bushmen, while the men are away either looking for work or in full employment.  Others are occupied by the families of teamsters.
