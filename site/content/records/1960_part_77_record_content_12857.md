Burra High School.  The Jubilee History continued by R.V. Mueller.

1949

The staff was as for 1948 except that Rae T. Blesing replaced Alma Hill.  The enrolment was 66.

The Minister for Education Mr R. Rudall and the Director of Education Mr E. Mander-Jones visited the school and discussed the schoolyard, the building of new laboratories, painting of the school and the erection of new classrooms, but the Minister did not promise much.  On 29 April the students visited Adelaide by train (three of them for the first time).  Two new classrooms were opened by Mr [illegible] Walker, Inspector of Technical Schools.

1950

The staff were H.O. Pederick Headmaster, Ivor Burdon, John G. Deer, Rae F. Blesing, Ronald E. Walker and Nancy Hannaford.  Enrolments were 62.  Painters moved in to repaint the school in May.  New septic tank lavatories were installed.  A polio epidemic discouraged any indoor functions.  The Parents & Friends Assoc. presented an Encyclopaedia Britannica worth £93.

1951

The staff was the same as for 1950 except that Margaret Miller replaced Nancy Hannaford.  Enrolment was 65.  Two houses were bought for staff members by the Education Department.  Buses were complained about – one was very cold in winter and hot and dusty in summer.  The other was so small it had to make two journeys morning and night.

1952

Staff were H.O. Pederick Headmaster, Ivor Burdon, John Deer, Clare Milazzo, Ronald Walker and Helen Inglis.  Enrolment was 66.  The underground tank became polluted with dead rats and pigeon manure.  ‘It is believed that when the tanks were emptied recently six dead rats were removed and approximately 61 buckets of pigeon manure.’

Trees were planted in honour of old scholars who had made the supreme sacrifice.  Mr S. Woollacott presented the honour roll.
