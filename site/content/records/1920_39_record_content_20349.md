Burra Town council, 2 August

Permission was given for a new house for Boz Pearce at Aberdeen.

Cr Kellaway moved to rescind the motion of Cr Riggs about the monument enclosure of 20ft x 45ft oblong because an enclosure of this size would be dangerous.

There was dissent over whether it was appropriate to proceed in the matter in the absence of Cr Riggs and eventually the question was deferred to the next meeting.

Cr Kellaway then gave further notice to rescind the motion that the work of enclosure be proceeded with.

It was resolved that the water trough in Market Square be cleaned once a fortnight.

Mr Ford offered to pay for trees and labour if the Council would plant gums and pines along his boundary on the north road.
