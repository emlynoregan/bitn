Mr Ray V. Warnes, our popular stationmaster, received a wire ordering him to leave on Thursday instead of on 3 July.  Arrangements were hurriedly made by Messrs Eddie and Glen Finch for a send-off at the Bon Accord Hotel at which the Mayor, T.H. Woollacott, presided.  Mr Warnes had been here for 3Â½ years.  He had fostered sport and assisted in getting the four young cricket teams together for local contests.  Speakers were: the Mayor, S. Kellaway, L.M. Gordon, H.N. Potter, A.L. Bence, Max Pearce, T.P. Halls, W.D. Thompson, Con. Lynch & Mr Nelson (the Copperhouse Schoolteacher.)  A presentation was made of an Onkaparinga travelling rug and also a gift for Mrs Warnes.
