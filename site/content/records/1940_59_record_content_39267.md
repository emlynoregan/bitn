Recent Rain.  Rain set in last Wednesday and continued until Monday.  The falls extended right across the district with thunderstorms in the pastoral area that will ensure green feed for months to come.   Many dams have been filled and R. Phillips at ‘The Gums’ reports 14 feet of water in a new dam there.  The cropping areas also benefitted, though there is some fear of rust in late sown areas, if hot weather follows.  Pastoral district falls ranged from 14 to 48 points for 4 November, but falls on 5 November were greater and overall Kia-Ora 78, Glenora 180, Woolgangi 50, Ketchowla 80, Koomooloo 25 and Pualca 15 are representative.
