W.H. Linkson is visiting the town for the first time in about nine years, owing to the death of his mother.  He holds a responsible position in the telegraph department in WA.  He is disappointed with the reserve in Redruth which he planted with trees at great cost and which if looked after would have beautified the town.  He was a tireless member of the Town Council while here.  [Dec. 1891-Nov. 1895]
