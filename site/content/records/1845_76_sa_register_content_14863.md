A lost child.  Yesterday afternoon at about 4 p.m. a five-year-old boy named Hilton was found to be missing from his home.  A search was organised and despite the effort continuing all night no sign of him was found.  At midday today a public meeting organised an even more extensive search and every place has been searched and waterholes dragged.  So far there has been no sign of the boy and it can hardly be hoped he has survived the fatigue and exposure he must have experienced.  [See, however, 21 September, page 3 .]
