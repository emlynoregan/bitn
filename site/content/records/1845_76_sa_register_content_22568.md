‘Beta – a subscriber of £25 altogether’ writes re the Redruth Church

In the accounts of the Norwood Church I have seen a certain amount borrowed from the Trustees of the Redruth Church.  I have heard that the interest has been given to the minister at Kooringa instead of allowing it to increase the funds.  As a subscriber I do not approve of that.  The Redruth Church will soon be wanted when the terminus of the railway is fixed.  The walls have been built three or four feet from the ground and if not there now the greater shame, for it is within sight of the parsonage.  The foundations are concrete on a hard rock base and cost over £100.  I will add to my donation when I see a prospect of its being carried out and I shall agree to nothing else being done with trust money.  I care not for giving my name publicly, but you can give it to any proper enquirer.
