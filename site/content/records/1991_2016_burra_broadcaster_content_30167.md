WWI Gun

The old gun alongside the former hardware shop at Burra North is being sought by the army Museum of SA.  It is a WWI 77 mm artillery piece and was captured by the 27th Infantry Battalion on the 8 August 1918 at Warfsee in France.  The museum is located within Keswick Barracks and is controlled by the army, but run by civilian volunteers.  It is open free of charge to the public.
