Eastern District Fire Fighting Organisation held its annual meeting at Koomooloo on Wednesday.  Chairman Don Lord welcomed visitors, especially Fred L. Kerr Director of the EFS and his Assistant Tony Kaye and National Parks & Wildlife Officer John Fitzgerald.  He said the fire risk is high this year.  The meeting supported the recommendations of the working party on country fire service re-organisation.  From 1 November 1974 to 25 February 1975 thirteen fires were attended to though only five were in the immediate area.  Radios had proved effective.  Don Lord was re-elected Chairman.  Two Traeger SSB 50 radio transceivers will be bought to give greater coverage.  At present the district covers 30 properties and 25 members.  It was recommended that the organisation becomes incorporated.  Ironically it was raining during the meeting, but the accompanying lightning reminded all that most of last seasonâ€™s fired had been caused by lightning and in SA such fires had burnt out nearly 31,000 km2.
