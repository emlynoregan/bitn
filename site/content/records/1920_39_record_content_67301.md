Obituary.  Mrs Roy Saxon died on 11 June at her residence in Prospect.  She was born Clara Reed, youngest daughter of the late Mr & Mrs Thomas Reed of Hope Farm 2 miles south of Kooringa in 1897 and was educated at Burra School and attended Kooringa Methodist Sunday School.  She is survived by her husband and one son.  Mrs F. Griffiths of Aberdeen is a sister.

[Marriage registration suggests Clara Read born 1895, but the birth has proved to be untraceable on the Birth CD.  Death registration says she died at Adelaide, residence Prospect aged 39.  The Griffiths connection also proved unhelpful, even though Mrs Griffiths was born Annie Read.]
