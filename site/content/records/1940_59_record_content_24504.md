Burra High School held its speech night on Wednesday 10 December at the Burra Town Hall.

Headmaster H. Petherick delivered his report for 1945.

He began by referring to the end of the war and the fact that about 100 old scholars had joined the various services – a proud record for such a small school.

He said the concert had been prepared in haste and the Intermediate exams had only finished two days before.

The year had started with only 46 students – 12 less than in 1944.  This was the result of the depression years and was expected to be the year of lowest enrolment.  Also no student had continued beyond Intermediate level.  This he considered a great pity because Leaving level was now required for entry into any profession and students would benefit from the extra time spent at school.

The staff had been himself and two assistant teachers, with one junior teacher.  At the May vacation Miss Owen was transferred to Murray Bridge HS and Mrs Spark resigned from the Department.  They were replaced by only Miss Butler.  A junior teacher came half-way through the term, but lasted only a week, because she said she had too much work to do.  After September we were granted another assistant, Mr Blight.  These changes and understaffing have not been in the best interest of students.

Miss Maddern, who has been Domestic Arts Teacher here for three years has now resigned and Mr Blight has been transferred to Pt Augusta.

In the 1944 Intermediate Exams full certificates were gained by four students and four others completed theirs.  One student gained a Leaving Certificate.  Eight gained an Intermediate Craft Certificate in Woodwork and nine more in Home Science.

This year all students have participated in plays and there have been a number of debates.

Three visits were undertaken by students this year: to the Waterworks, the Burra Record office and to the Town Council.  These were most instructive and now the war has finished it is hoped visits can be extended, perhaps to Adelaide, Pt Pirie and Whyalla and in future years even beyond the state.

It is intended to introduce drawing as an Intermediate subject and an effort will be made to extend the library.  This year there have been regular House Matches, but it has not proved possible to arrange matches with other schools.  With the easing of petrol and rubber restrictions in 1946 it is hoped Inter-School matches will be resumed.  Burra did come third in the Mid Northern High Schools Sports at Riverton in August – a creditable result for the smallest of the five competing schools.

The BHS Sports Day was held at Victoria Park and was very successful.  Cup winners were:

Senior Girls	Mary Pearce

Senior Boys	Brian Richards

Junior Girls	Dawn Bernhardt

Junior Boys	Donald Allen

The school took part in Burra’s Centenary Celebrations and gained the first prize in the Maypole Competition.

The High School Council has negotiated with Goldsbrough, Mort Pty Ltd and as a result has been given free of cost about three acres of almost flat land below the school.  It is intended next year to have this graded and have a cricket pitch and running track installed.  The firm is thanked for this magnificent gift.

It is thought likely that in 1946 there will be a transport service from Willalo, Hallett and Mt Bryan, which will be an asset for the school.

Dr Steele as Chairman of the High School Council also addressed the meeting.  He said raising the leaving age to 15 was going to come about, though it would have to wait until the Department could arrange for additions to schools and for more teachers.  The new transport arrangements could see the addition of 60 or more students to the school and that in turn would make it easier to argue for more staff.

The mayor distributed the prizes.  [A list of recipients is printed.]

The Dux of the school was Fayth Hawson-Clarke.

A program of items [also listed] was then presented.
