Burra Town Council, 7 Jan.

Mr Packard waited on the Council on behalf of Mr Killicoat and asked for a reduction of the fine of £50 imposed on him for resigning the Mayoralty.

Cr Pinch moved it be reduced to £10 plus costs.  Cr Rabbich 2nd.

Cr Sampson spoke at length against the proposal and moved it be not less than £20.  The resignation, he said, was an insult to ratepayers.

Cr Hardy 2nd this amendment as no explanation had yet been offered to them.

Crs Sampson, Hardy and Watt supported the amendment, which was lost on the casting vote of the Mayor.

The Mayor reported the conviction of two men on Christmas Eve for injuring trees.  Messrs Harris and Kennewell provided the information and declined the £5 reward.  Council voted them 7/- each as witness fees.

W. Davey has resigned as auditor and an election has been called for 28 Jan. with nominations to close on 21 Jan.

The general rate was fixed at 1/- in the £ with the health rate at 3d and parklands rate at 2d.

Cr Hardy moved that the Council lease the Burra Waterworks from the Government from I Jan. on the terms demanded which were very unsatisfactory, but which they are compelled to accept.  A condition being that the Government be required to provide a new supply if the present one fails and that no interest be payable during any period of insufficient supply.  He believed the Council could save £300 p.a. by doing the work themselves.  Cr Rabbich 2nd.

Cr Sampson opposed: he did not think there would be a saving and the water was unfit for human consumption.

Passed by Hardy, Watt, Rabbich & O’Leary with Sampson & Pinch opposed.
