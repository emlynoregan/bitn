Weather.  Recently a woodcutter in the eastern scrub reports it has been so cold overnight that a bucket of water outside the wagon froze almost solid and a waterbag slung on the wagon was solid.

In Burra lately it has been as cold as or colder than any can recall.  A number of sheep and lambs have been killed by the weather.
