Fire

The White Hart Garage, operated by the Thamm families at Burra North, was gutted by fire in the early hours of Friday morning last.  The fire appears to have started in the office area and spread along the roofline to the rear of the building.  MFS, CFS & SES crews attended and controlled the blaze within an hour.  The main damage was to the office and spare parts sections.  Some irreplaceable records of the firm’s history as wheelwrights have been lost.  Several vehicles were caught in the fire – a truck and Landcruiser were burnt and a tractor and Landrover suffered lesser damage.  Damage has been estimated at c. $250,000 and the clean-up is expected to take some weeks.  The fire was contained to the original section of the garage and fire investigators believe an electrical fault was the cause. [Photo of Travis Thamm in the burnt-out office.]
