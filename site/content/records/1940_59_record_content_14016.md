Burra North FFCF held its AGM 10 June.  It reported meeting twice a month in the Memorial Hall’s Primary Room and had 80 financial members.  Two large hampers were sent to Adelaide Cheer-Up Hut.  Christmas parcels were sent to soldiers.  A Christmas party raised £19-2-6 for 51 parcels and 8 hampers were donated after the party.  The unit donated £27-15-0, the value of 74 hampers, being 1 for each member at the time.  (7/6 per hamper)  [Reports on other money-raising activities follow.]

In the annual effort the unit decided to raise money by opening a shop on the premises known as the betting shop.  [This now-demolished shop was in Best Place facing east opposite the Royal Exchange Hotel.]  Altogether £412-18-11 was raised in the district and each unit was credited with one third of this.  [The election of officers is not reported.]
