Willalo School held a reunion to mark its closure after 60 years.  250 attended at the school on 45 December.  Chairman Mr Eric Ashby gave a résumé of the 60 years history of the school.

The school commenced in the newly built hall with Miss Herd as the first teacher.  She was followed shortly by Miss N. Daly, a lady of stout heart, stout cane and much discipline.

Several of the first pupils were present:

Ivy Affolter	Edith Jefferies

Janet Dawson	May Thomas

Thelma Bernhardt	Arnold Hanlin

John Sullivan	Joe Mannion

Former teachers attending:

Miss Betty Nobel	Ken McPherson

Miss Gert Madigan	G. Shaughnessy

Miss Vera Murray	G. Aesche

Miss Masey Sullivan	B. Brooks

B. Smith

Rick Adams (the present teacher)

In 60 years the school had an average attendance of 14.  In 1947 after many years of petitioning a new school was provided after strong support from Mr P.H. Quirke, a former MP.  This little school was well equipped and it is with regret that it is being closed and in the New Year a bus will provide a round-about 17 mile long daily trip to Booborowie School.  Tom Ashby and Keith Hanlin reminisced before an adjournment to the hall for luncheon.
