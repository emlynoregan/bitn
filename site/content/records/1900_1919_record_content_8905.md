J. Drew, candidate for West Ward, had previously refused to have anything to do with municipal matters, but as his firm was about the largest ratepayer in the town he felt it was his duty.  He felt if the Waterworks account could not be reduced they should be returned to the Government.  He was Burra born and so was his mother before him, so he felt he had some claim in the town.
