Burra Regional Art Gallery’s new exhibition ‘Home is Where the Heart Is’ was opened on Saturday evening.  Thirty-eight artists contributed paintings.  There were also displays from two contributing artisan groups.  Basketry SA artists produce innovative and contemporary creations.  Two artists from Craftsouth’s Traditional Skills Project brought a vibrancy of colour and texture to the exhibition with their traditional Nigerian batik textiles and Columbian mochilas bags.  A poem by Evan Hawke was read and Una Kelly recited Robert Browning’s Home Thoughts from Abroad.  Nan Annells officially opened the exhibition.
