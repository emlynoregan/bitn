Letter.  ‘Stretch’ Read of Burra seeks information about the descendants of James and Maria Reed, who arrived on the Trafalgar and reached Burra in 1854 with eight children.  And also of Thomas Reed born 1835, who married four times and who died in Kooringa 20 August 1913. – or of the families of his wives, who had the surnames Evers, Daniel, Villis and Rowe.

[Thomas Reed married Mary Evers in 1862, Mary Daniel in 1880, Mary Villis in 1881 and Mary Rowe in 1887.  Mary Villis was a widow and her birth name is given variously as Heffaran, Haferen and Heffernon.  Mary Rowe also says she was a widow, though the marriage registration cites her father as John Rowe.]
