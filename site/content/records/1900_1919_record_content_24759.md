Drew & Crewes’ premises have been recently extended and enlarged.  The plate glass front at Kooringa is a trifling introduction to the commodious premises.  The stock reaches over £12,000 and 30 hands are employed and in addition two large vans, which are travelling stores, serve the north, south, east and west.  The firm caters well for the pastoralist and deserves the title of universal provider.  The display rooms have over £1,000 worth of farming requisites and supplies anything from a needle to the very latest petrol engines.  [Probably an advt. posing as news.]
