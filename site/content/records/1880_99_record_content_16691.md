Burra Town Council

The Waterworks.  The question of laying fresh mains and services had been discussed with the Hydraulic Engineer, who suggested they be allowed to accumulate and then be charged to the capital account and he also promised to arrange to exchange the present engine for a more powerful one.  The banks of the reservoir should be planted with grass and notice boards fixed to warn trespassers.

The Mayor said the man in charge now was in the pay of the Council and as there were no funds it was necessary to collect rates, or arrange an overdraft.

Mr Rawling offered to buy at cost price the Council’s allotment in Aberdeen with the shaft on it.

Crown Lands Office wrote to say that as the Redruth Police Constable had been removed there would be no further charge on that account after 1884 unless a constable were sent again.

Cr Ridgway moved that the Council consider the services of a constable at Redruth necessary, but object to paying for the six months for which he was away.  Carried.

The Fire Brigade wrote to say that assuming sufficient mains pressure, all that is needed is a hand reel with hose etc. at c. £90 or a horse reel at c. £115.

The usual staff is one foreman and two firemen for a hand reel and one foreman and three or four firemen for a horse reel.  The cost to the Corporation would be half of the establishment cost and 1/6 of expenditure thereafter.

The Waterworks Engineer, Mr Jobson, notified the completion of the works and of his departure.  So far 447,000 had been consumed.  It was decided to arrange an overdraft as rates would be collected on 1 April and quarterly thereafter.

The finance report was introduced.  [And is printed]

Cr Ridgway moved its adoption.  It was painful he said - a case of reaping before sowing.

He said if they acted as outlined they would reduce the overdraft to £213-9-9.  He objected to pay £100 interest a year on bonds, but they also had to pay interest on the overdraft.  The overdraft had to be reduced as in 1888 they would begin to have to meet coupons for £200 p.a. and it would take all the income to keep going and to pay interest without doing any work, especially if the Government subsidy was withdrawn, as was almost certain.  The only good thing was that the money spent had greatly improved the town.

Cr West favoured spending the rates while the subsidy was available to enable claiming all they could.  He suggested ratepayers be asked to sanction a loan of say £500 to clear the debt and claim subsidy and do the usual works.  He supported the report as a statement of position, but not as a binding limit on their actions.

Cr Sampson also objected to being so bound.

Borrowing £500 would allow them to claim the full subsidy of £750 and spend that and all the rates on public work, but paying off the overdraft would leave little to spend and would lose £500 of Government money.  Moreover money could be got 3% cheaper on bonds than on overdraft.

Crs West and Sampson wanted to receive the report, but it was eventually adopted.

Cr West gave notice of a motion to borrow £500.
