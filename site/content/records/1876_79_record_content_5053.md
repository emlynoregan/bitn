Crops in the Baldina area are virtually a complete failure, except for some in the hills. Only crops grown on the western boundary hills in the Hs of Bright & Baldina will be worth anything this year and similarly in H. of Mongolata. West of Burra the season looks very good with a bountiful harvest in prospect and few rabbits in evidence.
