Children’s Patriotic Demonstration, 13 April, in aid of the Red Cross.

The effort reflected great credit on Mr R.T. Hitchcox, Headmaster of Burra School, Mr Biddle, Master of the High School and the teaching staff.  The day began with a basketball match between two teams of Burra girls.

Then there was a procession of about 50 pets.

The Boy Scouts then staged a demonstration.

They were followed by physical drill by the High School boys and girls, with the Girls’ Fife & Drum Band.

Organised games came next.

A party of returned soldiers from Springbank Estate provided songs.

Stalls comprised afternoon tea, sweets, plain goods, fruit & nuts; guess the weight of a pumpkin (89 lb).  A kookaburra and a basket of dahlias were auctioned.  Buttons were sold.

All in all £130 was raised including £25 worth of buttons sold on 2 April (to the Children’s Patriotic Fund.)
