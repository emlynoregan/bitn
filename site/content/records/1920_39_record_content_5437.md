The Booborowie Hall was to have been opened last Wednesday and Burra shops had closed and every conveyance was booked to take people to the event when a phone call announced the postponement to 12 October due to the very bad weather and the state of the roads.  The Leighton Quadrille Class has as a consequence postponed their Grand Masquerade Ball due that night.
