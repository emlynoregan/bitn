Mongolata Goldfield

Byles’ Mongolata GM Co. for the fortnight to 31 October

Delivered ore to the battery and have stopped breaking ore in stopes for the time.  Concentrating now on driving the South Drive at the 92 ft level and a small tunnel on the eastern hillside has been extended to 26 ft, with a face 10 ft deep.  Encountered a small vein showing gold at 25 ft.  Will extend further west before sinking on the vein.  Have begun loaming again about 80 ft south of this to see if we can pick up the seam again.

North Drive at 92 ft level has been extended to 46 ft, encountering ore veins of low value.  Now following ironstone dropper on this drive.

Continuing today the South Drive at the 92 ft level.

Have constructed a road through the dumps to get heavy machinery etc. to the main tunnel.

154 tons at the battery.
