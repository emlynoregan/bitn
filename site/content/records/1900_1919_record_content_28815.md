SAR Accident.

Ferdinand Oppermann of Petherton Estate was driving a wagon loaded with some 60 bags of wheat to Mt Bryan railway station on Thursday when the horses were struck by the express from Broken Hill at the crossing ¼ mile north of the town.  Two horses were killed instantly and one other had to be shot.  Mr Opperman, who was standing on the shafts, was thrown against the fence and believed killed, but has survived and is now out of danger.  He says he did not hear the train’s whistle, as he is deaf.

[There is adverse comment about the train’s guard, whose erroneous report of the accident was taken up by a city daily.]
