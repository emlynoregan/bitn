Ratepayers’ Meeting, Burra Institute, 20 November.

The Mayor presented his report as published in last week’s paper.

Mr Lane asked how £95-3-10 ‘other expenses’ was made up.  Mr Davey said it was exactly as in previous years and had never been specified item by item.  He then itemized the amount.

Cr Sampson moved the adoption, Cr J.A. Watt 2nd Carried.

P. Lane thought the ‘canal’ by the brewery was an eyesore and the money wasted.  The Mayor replied that the cost was all Messrs Bagot, Shakes & Lewis’s who had given £15 for it and 14/- or 15/- remained.

Cr Sampson thought Mr Lane was making a mountain out of a molehill.

He also thought the money spent on a road near the brewery was well spent.

Mr Lane disputed that the Council had spent its money wisely.

Mr Pinch moved a vote of thanks to the Council for its economical use of money.  R.M. Harvey 2nd.

Cr O’Leary said he was glad of the appreciation expressed, but could not afford the time to stand again.

When it came time for the candidates to address the meeting Cr Watt took the chair.

Mr Pinch addressed the meeting.  He would stand as a requisition signed by 113 ratepayers had asked him to do so.

Mr West would stand again for similar reasons.

Neither is reported as outlining any policies.

W.H. Hardy said he would stand.  He had two years previous experience and did not approve of either the need of the work at the brewery or its nature.
