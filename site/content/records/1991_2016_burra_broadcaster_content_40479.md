Letter.  Jo Gebhardt writes to congratulate Bob Perry for raising awareness of the Aleppo Pine as a declared weed.  ‘Many people are not aware of the uniqueness and importance of native grasslands, such as the Burra mine site and the surrounding hills and the need to protect them from non-native, invasive species such as the Aleppo Pine.’
