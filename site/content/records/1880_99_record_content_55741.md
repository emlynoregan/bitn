Editorial.  Looking Backwards.

1894 was nothing we can boast about; still the depression, which affected everyone, might have been worse.  Wool & wheat had fair seasons, though the prices were low.  Parliament has achieved little.  The town has done fairly well.  If there were no great improvements, it has held its own.  Sanitary arrangements are good.  The mine remains dormant with some hopes when copper prices rise again.
