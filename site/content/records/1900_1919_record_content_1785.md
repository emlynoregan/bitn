W.H. Hardy responds to those who have complained that a band concert on a Sunday is immoral.  He acknowledges the argument s in favour of keeping Sunday as a day of quiet contemplation etc.  He looks on Sunday as ‘the one day of freedom, of enjoyment and recreation to those who work the week through.  But at the present time anything more desolate and discouraging than Sunday is not to be conceived’.  He goes on to list the forms of amusement that are closed firmly, but what are open are ‘the dreary streets and public house corners to lounge on’.
