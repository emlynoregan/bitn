‘One of the People’ writes to the editor.  This is one of a series of letters published over many weeks on the subject of capital and labour.  The series is rather unusual in that it argues in favour of the capitalist in a quietly well-reasoned argument.

A typical paragraph to give the flavour:

‘The freedom of labour, so bitterly denounced by some would-be working class leaders, constitutes the great charter of the working man, enabling him to make the best terms he can with capital, which, after all has been said and done, is the best friend of labour, for neither can do without the other, their mutual co-operation signifying progress; and their mutual hostility, retrogression.’

[It was more common to see pieces taking a more left wing attitude to the role of capital, or occasionally to see items much more aggressively denouncing unionism.]
