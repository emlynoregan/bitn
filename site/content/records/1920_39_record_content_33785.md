State Elections

Liberal candidates spoke at Burra on 3 March before an almost full Institute.  Hon. G. Jenkins & Messrs R. Carter & P.A. McBride.  The depression seems to have awakened interest, as 50-100 would previously have been a good audience.  M.A. Radford took the chair.

Mr Carter said the Butler Government had come in facing large loans taken out by the Labor Party and also other commitments.  It had faced the problems and increased taxation had been essential.  He discussed changes in the Crown Lands Department and denied the Government had been harsh.  Drought and frost relief had cost £250,000 a year.  Subsidies had been paid to allow stock and fodder to travel at half rates on the railways.  The country had received more than its share of help over the period.  The candidates naturally spent a good while on the economic problems of large debts and excessive increases in imports not balanced by growth in exports.  They also attacked the arbitration system for wages.  It was often said all road money went on the city, but actually it had received £345,465 and the country got £2,154,872.  All the candidates favoured a referendum on the closing of liquor bars on Saturday afternoons.
