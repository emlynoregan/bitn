Merino Ram Embargo Relaxed

On 15 January the ban on the export of Merino Rams was relaxed.  Mr W. Brown of ‘The Grove’ Burra is President of the SA Merino Breeders Association.  He said it was a step towards the unity of the wool world.  The rest of the world had resented the embargo.  There can still be no export of semen or ewes and only 300 rams can be exported.  Mr Brown doubted whether that number would be reached.  There will be only one auction sale in each state in the twelve months before the policy is reviewed.  Mr Brown thought that 300 rams would not affect the Australian Stud or Commercial Breeder.  In 1967 he said from 1,850 registered Merino Studs 202,000 rams were sold.  In that year 1½ million Merino Ewes were mated.  Unsold rams that year totalled 294,000.  Given this scale of operation the 300 will have little impact.  He does, however, think the change might encourage breeders to produce more top sheep as has occurred with other breeds.  He also thinks it will foster the International Wool secretariat in obtaining support from all wool producing countries.
