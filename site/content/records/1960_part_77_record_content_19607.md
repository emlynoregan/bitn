The Anzac Day Parade and Service was held on Sunday 19 April.  About 60 RSL members and a crowd of about 300 attended.  The RSL members were led by the Port Pirie Pipe Band and marched along Commercial Street to Stock Street and then returned to the War Memorial for the service.

[Since Stock Street is parallel to Commercial Street this is clearly not correct.  Previous marches would suggest that Kangaroo Street or perhaps Ware Street is more likely.]

Wreaths were laid by representatives of the RSL, Air Force Association, and Fathersâ€™ Association and for the Town by Mayor E.T. Baulderstone and the District Council by Cr Quinn.

Rev. Lind delivered the address.  The commemoration service in the evening was held at Kooringa Methodist Church.
