Monsignor T.F. Toal, Parish Priest of Jamestown and his brother Dr M.F. Toal celebrated their Golden Jubilee of Ordination at Jamestown this week.  They were ordained in Genoa, Italy, 29 May 1926.  There was Mass at St James’ Church at 11 a.m. followed by luncheon at the Jamestown Town Hall.  Monsignor Toal studied at Mungret College, Limerick, and then at Collegio Brognole Sale, Genoa.  After ordination he came to Australia and served in the Perth Diocese before coming to SA.  He then served at Jamestown, Streaky Bay, Pt Pirie and at Whyalla for 31 years and in 1967 returned to Jamestown.

Dr Toal served at Jamestown and then at Burra and Pt Pirie.  While at Burra in the 1930s and 1940s he was an interpreter at Loveday Prison Camp in WWII because of his multi-lingual abilities.  He was a Professor at St Patrick’s College, Manly, and at St Francis Xavier’s Seminary, Adelaide.  He went to Rome 23 years ago.  He has been engaged in translating and publishing the homilies of the Fathers of the Catholic Church.  Four volumes have already been published.
