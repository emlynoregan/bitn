MINING IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA from the London Mining Journal

[The writer begins with a description of Port Wakefield and the sale of land there and then moves on to the sale of agricultural land and then the mineral lands of Emu Flats.  These are all points noted already, as they occurred.  He does add a couple of interesting points:

Discoverers of minerals went to extraordinary lengths to hide their discoveries so that there would be no extra bidders forcing up the price of the land when it was auctioned.  Sometimes green rocks were painted over, or a flock of sheep were camped on the site, or a hut could even be erected over the discovery.

The Burra Burra proprietors paid premium prices for allotments at Emu Flats even though it was unlikely they would develop a major copper mine there.  They were convinced that the ore from there would be useful as a flux in smelting the Burra ores and they were also concerned that, with a limited supply of miners, the development by others of a major mine would reduce their ability to raise ore at the Burra Burra Mine.]

Copper Smelting in SA [An extract from the London Mining Journal]

From the latest reports from Australia it appears that ‘tough cake’ copper is offered for sale at the offices of the SA Company.  A ship sailing for Singapore carried 246 tons of copper:

5257 tasks

152 blocks

4369 ingots

76 pigs

3900 ciles

These came from the Kooringa, Apoinga, Yatala and Kanmantoo smelters.

Assays in Calcutta say it is reckoned to be the purest ever brought to that market and equal to Russian ingot.  At this early period the colony dares to compete, and that successfully, with the parent country in the Indian market.

[The writer then goes on to complain that copper is not being smelted in England and cannot understand why not.]
