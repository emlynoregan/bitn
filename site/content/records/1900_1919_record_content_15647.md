[Mrs Morgan is hard to trace in registrations of births etc.  She seems to have been born Amelia Mitchell, daughter of Simon/Symon and to have married Lem Soey at Kapunda 10 May 1871.  The couple had a daughter, Amelia Laura born at Laura and died at Burra, both in 1880.  Another daughter, Amelia, lived for about a week in 1883.  On 10 November 1883 she married Michel/Michael Millear and had two children, Harrietette was registered at Kooringa in 1884 and James Edgar in 1888.  She married John Morgan on 13 January 1903.  The deaths of the first two husbands do not appear to have been registered in SA, but given that Lem Soey appears variously as John Lem-Soy, Lemsoey, Lam Soey, Lem Soey and Soy it may be there somewhere.  Millear is also susceptible to many variations.  The various sources give her birth between 1850 and 1855.]
