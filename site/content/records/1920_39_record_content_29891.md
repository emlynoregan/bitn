Mr & Mrs Josiah Thomas of ‘Three Trees’ Diamond Wedding.

Mrs Thomas is the daughter of the late Mr & Mrs Henry Pinch of Pencarrow.  [Often Pencarrow]  Mr Pinch was the grandfather of Freemasonry in Kooringa.  Mrs Thomas claims to be the first girl born in Redruth on 11 January 1851, where her father built the first house.  Mr and Mrs Thomas were married 15 February 1869 in the old Church of England on Limestone Hill by Rev. Lionel Stanton.  Mr Thomas was born at Forestgate in the parish of Whendron, three miles from Redruth in Cornwall and for the last 60 years has lived within three miles of Redruth, Burra.  His parents Mr & Mrs John Thomas migrated in 1848 in the William Money.  Mr Thomas was then less than three years old.  His father proceeded to Burra where he was engaged as an underground manager of the mine.  The family was left in charge of the eldest son aged 22, but he did not do his duty and the family had to tramp to Adelaide from Port Adelaide before getting a dray for Burra.  On arrival they lived in a nice paling house in the mine.  Mr Thomas recalls the brewery in the area of the present hospital.  He recalls rather wild times when released convicts from Tasmania got together.  (With names like ‘Hell-fire Jack’ and ‘Tosky’ Jones.)  He learnt to play the harmonium from John Pearce – an instrument later placed in the Copperhouse Church.  He received a little education from H.N. Thompson a clerk at the mine and at 10 years of age he was a cow-boy, a bullock-driver or a fencer as required.  He recalls a large number of blacks were then about.  There was a big camp of them on the western side of the mine at the old magazine where a clump of sheoaks stood and where a child died.  They caused some consternation by running through the mine tunnels with the body saying that thus ‘Maldabbie’ (the Devil) would not be able to catch him now.  The body was then placed on top of a Sheoak and covered with boughs.

Mr Thomas’s father died when he was 18 and left him the property where he still lives.  Of a family of four only one survives: Maud, Mrs C.W. Gare of Kooringa and late of Mt Bryan East.  There are 9 grandchildren and 6 great-grandchildren.  Their only son the late H.H. Thomas, a well-known pastoralist, died in 1919.  Mr Thomas still drives a horse drawn vehicle.
