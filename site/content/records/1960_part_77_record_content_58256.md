Burra Motel Plans

The meeting at the Burra Town Hall on Thursday indicated sufficient support for further investigations.  Expected cost for 20 units and dining room facilities is c. $120,000 and this is to be raised by the formation of a private company.  The number of shareholders for a private company is limited to 50. At a meeting in the RSL Hall next Tuesday other methods of arranging finance will be investigated to allow the participation of those with less capital to invest.  Five possible sites are being considered.  Mr Allen MP is urging the sealing of the Morgan-Burra Road and this would certainly help this project.
