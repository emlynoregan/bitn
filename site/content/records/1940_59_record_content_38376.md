Aerated Water Factory for Burra

Messrs Cummins & Franklin of Burra Cold Stores are going to put into operation an aerated water factory in the near future.  It is expected to be running in about two months.  One of the main problems was the local water.  Tests showed that the local water supply was too salty.  In fact they found seven different solids, averaging 107 grains per gallon and these could not be removed by the usual filtration methods.  Further investigation discovered a super filter, which has made the project viable.  There would appear to be no similar factory between here and Broken Hill.
