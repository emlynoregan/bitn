The SA Endurance Riding Association held ‘An Introduction to Endurance Riding’ at Somme Brae Station about 3 km northwest of Booborowie on 11 August.  More than 100 people and 60 horses attended.  After a seminar on Saturday nearly 40 riders mounted for a 20 km trail on stock routes and dirt roads.  On Sunday the Gawler Endurance Riders Club hosted an 80 km ride or a 40 km training ride or a 20 km trail ride.  The whole event was deemed a success and organisers hope to repeat the event in 2002.
