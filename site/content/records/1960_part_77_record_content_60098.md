Burra Anglican Parish Old Style Country Fair was held at the Burra Showgrounds last Saturday.  The crowd of about 700 was well entertained and buying at the stalls was brisk.  The gross takings of about $1,150 should see a nett return of about $900.  The merry-go-round built by Thamm’s Whitehart Garage was a non-stop success, with children queuing all afternoon.  Horse rides were popular and so was the Children’s Fancy Dress Competition, which gave the judges, Rev. & Mrs Hore of Burra Uniting Church, a difficult task.  Visitors from Adelaide were offered a three hour town tour with the Mine included and a surprising number of Burra people patronised this option too.  The motor cycle skills of the Denton Bros of Farrell Flat delighted the boys and girls.
