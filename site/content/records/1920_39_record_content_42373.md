Football

Aberdeen	2.2	7.5	7.7	11.10	(76)

Hallett		3.3	3.5	6.8	6.9	(45)

Burra Amateur Basketball Assoc. completed the first round.

[This organisation does not seem to have been previously reported and the team names are Rovers, Brownies, Dreadnoughts, Spartans, Athenians and Bluebirds.  Brownies & Bluebirds suggest these were womenâ€™s teams and the game may have been what is now Netball.]

Burra Rifle Club fired its last two matches for the season.  In the first best scores were by W.V. Bass, C.H. Fearon & W. Woodman.  In the second C.H. Fearon & W.V. Bass scored best.
