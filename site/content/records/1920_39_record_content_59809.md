Graham H. Dow, as Hon. Sec. Burra RSL writes outlining the case of Archie Nolan.  This young man took part in a hastily organised motor cycle race at the Anzac Sports 6 May 1935.  An accident occurred during the event, which has left him an invalid and unable to work.  He is the son of a returned soldier and the RSL is opening a subscription list to help him, starting it with a donation of Â£25.  They appeal for public subscriptions.
