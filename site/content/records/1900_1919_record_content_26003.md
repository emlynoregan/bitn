Wheat.  A record load of something like 12 tons was delivered to the Burra Station on Friday â€“ probably a state record.  There were 144 bags of wheat on the wagon drawn by 11 fine horses comprising the teams of Messrs P. Heinrich and V. Webb.  The wheat came from Koonoona.  No breakages occurred till entering the station yard when the awkward turn resulted in a broken shaft and one wrenched tyre.
