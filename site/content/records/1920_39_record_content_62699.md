Cr Kellaway said East Ward had the road to the Recreation Park to attend to and it was in a very bad condition.  It was not long ago that each of the other Wards had given North Ward £20 to build a swing bridge.  He moved that each ward receive approximately one third of the rates collected from that ward.  Thus:	North Ward	£160
