Saltbush Clothing celebrates its 20th birthday.  Twenty years ago Elspeth Radford established the business, inspired by a lack of smart durable clothes.  She and Graham Radford set up Saltbush Clothing Co. in a farmhouse outside Burra to fill a need for hard-wearing casual clothes that were well designed and attractive.  Before long the business had grown to a shop in Burra and now the company sells more than 40,000 garments annually in more than 120 retail outlets across Australia.
