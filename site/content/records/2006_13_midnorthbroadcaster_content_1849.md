Fire.  Last Wednesday an electrical fault caused a fire in the roof of a house in Paxton Terrace.  MFS & CFS crews took about 30 minutes to control the fire.  [Steve Boyesâ€™ house.]

Later in the evening firebugs, who lit grass fires last week, seem to have been out again and the MFS & CFS crews attended a small fire of about a quarter of an acre near the Burra Sports Complex.

Wednesday was a day of extensive fires across SA, especially serious north of Pt Lincoln.
