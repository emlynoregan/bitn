Kooringa News, 10 December

The censure of Mr Winship in yesterday’s editorial created a sensation here and the consensus was that it was well merited.  It is true that the distress you alluded to is all too real.  Many men have been induced to throw up their employment and having disposed of their possessions at great sacrifice have left here almost penniless in the expectation of a free passage to Newcastle and the assurance of employment upon arrival.  Now the bubble has burst and they find themselves destitute, without either home or employment.  Others have not left yet, but have given up their employment and sold their possessions.  They are doubtful of regaining their jobs, but if they do are still confronted with the need to refurnish their homes at great expense.  While not wishing to shield Mr Winship from legitimate blame, but it is a fact that he desired the men not to act rashly or precipitately and he did send a telegram to one of their number stating that he no longer required then and asking them to remain where they were.  This was disregarded and dismissed as a concoction of the telegraph clerk at the instigation of the Burra Directors.   There have thus been faults on both sides.  Mr Winship was certainly at fault in offering so much in the first place and the miners at fault in acting without more discretion.

Rev. T. Lloyd delivered a lecture last Friday in the Wesleyan Schoolroom on Grant Thorben; an example of perseverance and diligence.  Attendance was quite good considering the hot and sultry weather.

Rev. M. Wilson preached special sermons on Sunday on behalf of Wesleyan Missions and promoted the same cause at a public meeting on Monday and to young people on Tuesday.

On one of Mr Tyler’s northern stations recently a flood swept away the huts and total possessions of two men named Moore and Brooks who were living there with their wives.  They all had a very narrow escape and are now penniless.  I understand Rev. Hancock is endeavouring to obtain relief for them and will gladly receive contributions on their behalf.

Shearing is now over and wool carting is rapidly proceeding.  I believe the clip has been a tolerable one in this district.
