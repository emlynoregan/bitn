SA History Week runs from 16-25 May.  This year in Burra the focus is on the National Bank, which is 150 years old this year.  One of NAB’s founding companies, The National Bank of Australasia, was founded in 1858 and Burra’s branch is one of the oldest, having opened in Kooringa (Burra) on 25 April 1859.  The first branch manager, Mr R.G. Prole was paid a huge £300 p.a.  The bank was founded in Victoria and SA was the first of the other colonies for expansion.  Burra’s branch was established before the bank had offices in Sydney, Melbourne or Perth.
