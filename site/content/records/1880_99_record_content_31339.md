Editorial on The Burra Mine

When the mine opened it saved SA from a severe financial crisis and made many futures.  For many years it yielded a rich quantity of copper, but little developmental mining was done and the company merely picked out the ‘eyes’ of the mine.  Then came a stoppage, a restart and about 12 years ago a final stoppage.  The property is a great freehold covering not only the mine but also the town of Burra and for many years the SAMA would not sell an inch of the town which was held on lease.  When some 10-12 years ago they began to sell they always reserved the right to the minerals and always retained the mine itself, which has now been sold to an English company.  The workings are singular, comprising mainly a vast excavation of irregular shape surrounded by cliffs of ‘country’.  As now seen the chasm is open to 20 fathoms and in places the sides can be descended to that depth at the bottom of which is a lake of green water.  Of course when the mine was working the water was forked down to its bottom.  North of the cutting is Beck’s shaft - only to water level.  East is Tinline’s Shaft of the same depth.  Southwest is Bunce’s and south the engine shafts.  Copper leaders are found everywhere, but the mine has never been explored beyond shallow depths.  Had that been done old hands believe the main lodes lie to the south while others favour the east.  Tinline’s shows rich traces, but is also where water flows very strongly.  The mine has always been very wet and forking it was costly, though the water was made to work for the mine after being raised.

About 18 months ago an old miner thought that the hard employment situation would make earning a living in the mine a better chance than leaving home to look for work and he got permission to work on tribute.  He did very well fossicking for pockets of rich ore that had been overlooked.  He and his sons worked on, doing well, and gradually others joined.  The rising copper price made it worthwhile.  Now close on 40 men and boys are working on tribute and last month about 50 tons of 30% ore were sent away.  The proprietors are at no cost; all work is above water level.  All around the pool edge are hand jigs and the tributers are turning over the refuse of earlier days.  Ore is run to the water’s edge and there hand dressed before being carried up to the floors for sampling.  Even lowering the water ten feet would uncover much ore that the tributers have traced down to water level and room would be made for a hundred more workers.  A few of the tributers are sinking from the surface, but as yet without finding a definite lode.  Since news came a month ago of the sale of the mine to an English company the miners in the town have been waiting for further information.  It is believed that the mine will soon be in full swing again, though this will require the input of considerable capital.
