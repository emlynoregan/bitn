Redruth Ladies’ Guild sponsored a Flower Show in the Redruth Memorial Hall on Wednesday 29 September.  The stage was decorated with delicate wisteria.  Perhaps the most vivid colours were provided by the ranunculi and sweet peas were also prominent.  More colour was added by anemones, yellow daisies and white daisies.  There were dainty pastel and shot-silk coloured aquilegias along with antirrhinums and stocks.  Roses were plentiful as usual and so were pansies.  Adding to the display were geraniums, nasturtiums, lilac, schizanthus and carnations.  There were in all 126 entries.  As well as flowers there were 58 entries in cookery that included pasties, sausages rolls, sponges, fruit cakes, scones, biscuits and luncheon trays.  The Mayoress, Mrs F.t. Marston opened the Flower Show.
