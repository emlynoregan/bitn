Burra Cheer-up Ladies’ band & AIF Boys Concert.

As the boys enlisted the Burra Coronation Brass Band numbers fell and at the end only a couple were left and it had to be disbanded.  The Cheer-up Girls decided to take its place.  Appeals were made for donations and for instruments.  When news reached the Exhibition Camp in Adelaide a concert party was organised.  The Burra Cheer-up Society had done so much to help the boys and this was a chance to repay something.  Lt W.A. Read OC gave permission for a visit to Burra for a concert.  The aid of Miss Hilda Felstead and Miss Kitty Sullivan was enlisted.  The concert on Monday was packed.  The Ladies’ band led off with Templesmore and given the short time for practice the result was impressive.  It was a pleasure to listen to and earned the storm of applause it got.  The rest of the concert was very good and was rapturously received, especially Miss Kitty Sullivan’s burlesque of The Melodrama and Miss Felstead’s comic songs.  The sum raised for the band was £33 including a £5 donation from Mr T.H. Pearse.  [Details of the review run to almost 1 column.]
