Sister Elizabeth Mosey, daughter of the late Mr & Mrs A.J. Mosey of Brady Creek and Robertstown and who was Matron of the Burra Hospital many years ago, has distinguished herself in the war by an act of heroism.  When the Japanese captured Hong Kong she defied the Japanese Soldiers in defence of the sick and wounded and denied them access to the sick room at the hotel.

Later Japanese soldiers entered the sick room at Fort Standley and bayoneted fifty wounded Britons.  They raped and killed three nurses and raped the remaining nurses, but did not kill them.

Sister Mosey won a Royal Red Cross in the Great War and when the present war broke out she was holidaying in Tasmania.  She immediately volunteered and boarded the first transport.  Relatives have been informed that although a POW she is in good health.

[Sister Mosey was in charge of the Burra Hospital from the end of 1905 to November 1912.]
