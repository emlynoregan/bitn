R. Fuss alias ‘Ratepayer’ responds to the Pool Committee Secretary.

In the first half of the letter he condemns the secretary for attacking ‘Ratepayer’s’ lack of intelligence and for defining temerity as timidity, when it actually means rashness, recklessness or audacity.  He goes on the say he does not fear his rates being increased because they are now as high as the Act allows.  But it was made quite clear at the meeting that unless the project is handed over to the Council there will be no Government subsidy – as the Spalding Committee was told a short time ago and as the banker knew.  Furthermore it is a fact that he has access to any information on the hands of the Council, as does any ratepayer who cares to attend Council meetings or enquire from the Clerk.  The financial scheme of the Council is to gradually reduce the rates and get the overdraft into a reasonable condition over the next five years, but they will be loath to accept any further commitments extraneous to the general working of Council.  ‘As for the parrot cry “It won’t cost the ratepayers one penny”  it is used so often that dogs in the street are barking it.’

‘All I want is guarantors to protect the rates “just in case” and as the promoters have no confidence in their own convictions, no guarantors will be forthcoming, of that I am fairly sure.’

‘As for the ‘timidity’ charge – some of the most intelligent people in the world write articles and books using assumed names and only a few nitwits sneer at them.’

So to put this poor fellow out of misery here goes.

R. Fuss, alias Ratepayer.
