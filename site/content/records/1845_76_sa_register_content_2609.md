This reply, not having been previously communicated to the men, and they were surprised to find that the Directors themselves had not failed to give attention to the petition, though for some reason it had not been announced to them.  Though the neglect was not attributable to them, the Directors would of course be responsible for the negligence of their servants.

The Directors granted an interview on Tuesday to a few individuals and the result was as might have been foreseen.  The explanation was from the first all that was required.  The Directors never intended to wrong the men and the men wanted only what was right.  The consequence was that the men got more than they had asked for, but nothing more than they would have obtained had no strike occurred.

The men seemed satisfied and praised the attitude of the Directors.  By means of a note they expressed their regret for what had happened and also asked that their past wages might not be forfeited.  (Their contracts make such a fine possible.)  At the men’s request the Directors agreed to a return to work on Wednesday morning.

During the interview some other matters were raised and dealt with.  On the question of the Doctor’s medical fees, they were told to take that up with the Doctor themselves.  I am told that this step resulted so far satisfactorily that the men desired to withdraw their complaints on this score.

In the midst of this discussion the Directors gave notice that because of a fall in the copper price and due to the large supply of ore at grass, ‘they had been instructed by the Court [of Directors], when they left Adelaide to say that a reduction in the establishment, both as to numbers and wages, would be necessary at the mines, to meet the state of the markets.  They did this so that the men might not be taken by surprise and suppose the strike to be the occasion of it.

The men received this news amicably, merely expressing regret at it.

‘The whole place soon assumed quite a new appearance.  The good feelings of the men towards the Court of Directors and their active Secretary, gave vent in a concert in the evening, in front of Wren’s Hotel (where at least 150 of the men were assembled), and at the close loud cheers were given for that “august body.”’

‘If we except the illegality of compelling men to leave off work, I cannot too loudly praise the conduct of the miners in this (unnecessary) strike.’

[He goes on to mention the lack of drinking at the time and the beneficial influence of the town’s ministers of religion.]

[The paper then continues its own commentary.]

The Directors left for Adelaide with a full team of well-fed horses.  Unfortunately Mr Chambers lost control of the restive animals when the Police Commissioner, who was sitting next to him, incautiously laid hold of the reins.  This occasioned a capsize and all the passengers sustained injuries to varying degrees.  No bones were broken, but Mr Beck, the most seriously hurt, was left behind.
