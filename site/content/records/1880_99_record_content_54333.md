Unemployment Meeting at the Institute last Saturday.  The weather was very rough, but a good number attended.  Cr W.H. Linkson took the chair.

The discussion centred upon restarting the ballast quarry.  A resolution called on the Commissioner of Public Works to do this.

W. H. Hardy moved that the Mayor ask the Commissioner of Public Works how many Burra men might get work at the Gumbowie water supply works and when.  Carried.

W.T. Rabbich moved that the Mayor be asked to transmit these resolutions to the districtâ€™s members as early as possible.  Carried.

The Mayor arrived at his point, having thought the meeting was for 8 p.m. and not 7.30.

Mr Holder sent a telegram on Tuesday afternoon saying that he and Mr Lake had seen the Commissioner who had said 25 Burra men would be sent to Gumbowie next week with others to follow.  There was as yet no decision on the ballast quarry.
