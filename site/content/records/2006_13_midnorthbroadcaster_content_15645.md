Thr Burra Show last Saturday was opened by Mr Dan van Holst Pellekaan MP, Member for Stuart.  A new attraction this year was Adrian Harryâ€™s XTreme Trials, which drew big crowds for each of three scheduled performances.  The Ute Muster was popular, with 20 entries.  The floral display was excellent.  Organising Committee President John Oates said that is was a great success and numbers attending were up on the previous year.  There were 27 entrants in the shearing contest, which was the highest number for 12 years.  Poultry and pigeons made a return, thanks to co-ordination by Brett & Laura Jones.  Food stalls were well patronised throughout the day.  Mr Oates said there was increasing interest from exhibitors and people outside the district.
