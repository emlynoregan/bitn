Burra Golf Club opened its season last Saturday.  The President Dr Steele said that following application for some tennis courts to be built at the grounds of the Sports Syndicate the club had agreed to some slight alterations to the links, but he was sure members would soon become accustomed to the new starting point.  Approval had been given for the erection of what he humorously described as an ‘embryo club house’, which while not pretentious would serve a useful purpose until a more elaborate structure could be built.  It would be of wood and iron 30ft x 12ft with a brick fireplace and be partitioned to provide room for the ladies.  The estimated cost was £60.  The incorporation of the club had been arranged and the ladies had decided to form a club of their own.

Mr Haese drove the first ball because Dr Steven, last year’s champion, had an injured finger.

The Burra Bowling & Croquet Clubs closed their season last Saturday.  The Bowling Club had had a successful year.  They had won the cup from Kapunda this year and the matches against Clare were even and Clare had retained the shield on aggregate.  Against other clubs they had done well with wins against Blyth, Eudunda and Balaklava.

The trophies for both clubs were reported in the last issue.
