The Ratepayers’ Meeting

The Town Clerk contradicts some statements made at the recent Ratepayers’ Meeting.

It was said the Council can raise or lower its assessment as it sees fit.  This is not so: it can only vary the assessment at the Court of Appeals or when the assessment is being adopted.

The Clerk’s salary is based on an award made by the Industrial Court.  This says that when the Council revenue is over £3,000 the salary shall be £295.  If the revenue is less than £3,000 the salary shall be 10% on the first £2,000 and then 7½% on the rest.

When he holds more than one office he shall be paid 10% on the salary for such extra duties.  He has been paid £15 as Inspector and was entitled to £29-10-0.

There was not an appointment under the Impounding Act for a Ranger till 1925 when J.J. Parker was appointed for one year.  J.H. Harris was appointed with the powers of a Ranger in 1930.

It would be better in future if the Town Clerk were able to make corrections at the meeting.  As the Town Clerk is now a part-time officer his salary will automatically drop by £40 p.a. at least from 1 December.
