Redruth News, 5 February

The election is eliciting little attention here.  A requisition signed by many leading persons has urged Captain Killicoat to stand, but he has declined.  He would have been well qualified and is known as a thoroughly upright man.

The ‘letting’ at the Burra Mine was better than for some time.  Several pitches were let in the lobby at reduced prices, but sufficient to permit pretty fair wages.  The creek continues to turn out the usual 400 to 500 tons per take, of 14% ore.

Even without the railway many are confident of the future prosperity of the Mine.  The new [Graves’] shaft is down to 40 fathoms where a plat is being cut.

Accident.  Mr Moody Sen. was thrown out of his buggy on the morning of 4 February, but his injuries are not as serious as first thought.

Much discussion locally concerns the possible location of the station.

In the Hiles v. Kronke case – arising out of an earlier case in which Mr Hiles was charged with an indecent assault on one of his shepherd’s wives – Mrs Kronke has been committed to the Supreme Court for perjury.

Despite the difficult trading conditions in the town there has not yet been a single case of insolvency.
