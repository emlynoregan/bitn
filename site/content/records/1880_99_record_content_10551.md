Burra Town Council, 3 September.

The Town Clerk reported that the water guarantees had reached £320 and that SAMA had been written to for aid.  Another fortnight has been allowed for further effort.  The Yorke’s Peninsula Mining Association informed the Council they would negotiate the sale of their pumping engine.  Council will inform them that they would have to deal with the Government.

The Town Clerk reported he had cancelled two [cab] drivers’ licences after the court cases the previous week.

Alfred Schutz asked that his licence be restored and promised to reform.  Council decided not to accede to the request at present.

The Local board of Health heard the inspector’s report on Opie’s Hotel and resolved that the Board adjourn to the hotel the next day at 9.30 a.m. to make an inspection.

4 September.  The whole Board, excepting Mr Lockyer met at the appointed place, and after making an inspection resolved that while the premises examined are in a bad state of repair, and some of the rooms on the north and west sides are far too damp for occupation as bedrooms and should immediately be repaired, the Board of Health do not consider that there is sufficient danger to public health and safety to call for their present interference.  Also that the occupier be warned, that unless the necessary repairs be effected and dampness remedied within one month, the Board will step in and declare the rooms uninhabitable.  Meeting then adjourned.
