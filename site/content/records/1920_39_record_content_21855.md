Burra Town Council, 20 December 1926

J.R. Turnbull was granted permission to erect a wood and iron room in Redruth for a resident there.

T.H. Woollacott was given permission to build residences for Messrs Oates and Triggs in Kooringa.

The cost of digging a 7ft grave is to be increased from 15/- to £1.

Cr Harris queried the administration of the Owers Trust Fund.  He thought the deed, dated 1867, was for the use of cases of distress in Burra.  The trust of £400 was to pay interest to the disabled Mr Owers and then on his death to his wife and children to the age of 16 and then to relieve distress.  All trustees had long been dead and their replacements had left the town.

Cr Bednall said the matter had nothing to do with the Council.  The present trustees were Dr Steele, Messrs J.R. Barker, John Drew, C.D. Wilkinson, Thomas Edwards, W.G. Hawkes and M.A. Radford.

Cr Harris queried whether the money raised by public subscription should be sent out of the town.

Cr Bednall said that was wrong: it was a straight gift from Alex. McCulloch.
