Pages 2 & 3

Here we get the usual smaller advertisements, Council notices and stock sales advertising and the like.  Then comes the news, but this is increasingly interspersed with small print adverts and humorous stories and jokes which in some issues extend for over one column.

‘Sparks’ continues and is less cryptic than in some earlier years.

Even under ‘Current Topics’, which had traditionally been the heading for local news, it is annoying to find articles that turn into jokes or even advertisements.  By July the heading was gone and the mixture of other items more than ever intruded on news.  But this is quite inconsistent and in most issues news still had the dominant role.

There was much less news from other district correspondents than had been common earlier.

Serials continued to be a feature of the paper.
