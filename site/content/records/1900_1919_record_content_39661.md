Belgian Relief Fund

At a public meeting on Wednesday 18 November the Mayor, Mr Crewes, presided and saw the formation of a committee to raise money for Belgian relief.  F.C. Harvey was appointed secretary and treasurer.  As well as money there was an urgent need for clothing.  Mr Crewes was elected President.  Mr Dane offered the money from the next patriotic concert to the fund.  Several sporting events have been suggested to raise money.

Patriotic Fund Committee

Mr Radford suggested that a portion of the fund be given to the Belgian Fund, but Mr Crewes said he did not believe it possible as they were committed for specific purposes.  Also the Red Cross ladies have said they have enough to do without getting involved with the Belgian Fund.

The Methodist Sunday school children have given up their annual picnic and donated Â£10-10-0 to the Belgian Fund.

Mr C. Fuss moved that the request of the Belgian Committee be acceded to that for a time all patriotic fund raising from the various subcommittees go to the Belgian Fund.
