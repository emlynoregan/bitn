Cricket.  There are four teams in the local association and they are currently engaged in installing a new concrete pitch at the northern end of the Burra Racecourse.  Malthoid will be placed over the finished pitch.  This new pitch has been made necessary because the concrete pitch at Victoria Park is unplayable and will not be in a fit condition for play until the War Memorial Committee has completed its project.
