Diprotodon Bones

Tourism Minister, Jane Lomax-Smith launched the Diprotodon display in the foyer of the offices of the Regional Council of Goyder at Burra.  Professor Rod Wells provided background on the climate of the area some 70,000 years ago.  Evidence suggests sea levels were low and temperatures were also low.  The first humans may have arrived in this period of 63,000 to 70,000 years before the present.  He said human use of fire probably played some role in the extinction of the mega fauna.  Local District Ranger Ian Falkenberg said that in the early twentieth century up to 20,000 sheep per month travelled through the Redbanks area using stock routes from Broken Hill.  The area was declared a reserve in 1968.  Management problems saw the area handed over to the Burra Burra DC, but the difficulties persisted with off-road motorbikes, the dumping of cars, rough camping, wild parties and eventually a human tragedy.  In 1990 the Council closed the area and sought to offload it.  The Department of Environment and Heritage took it on and removed 150 car bodies, erected fences and signage and developed a management plan.  The area is highly regarded for its fossil remains.
