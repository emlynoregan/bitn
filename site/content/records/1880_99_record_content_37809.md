Mr Holder then spoke.  The policy of the Progressive Land Tax had been unanimously adopted on the hustings.  It has been said that there was never a majority in the House in favour, but they had 23 and if Messrs Gould, McDonald and Bartlett had been in their places they would have had 26.  Also at the time Grayson, Kingston, Stock and Sir J.C. Bray had announced themselves in favour with some qualifications, so even then there was a majority in favour of a Progressive Land Tax scheme.  This justifies the action taken about the dissolution of the House.  The way the measure was thrown out was only a party move to get rid of the Government.  The split was that Kingston, Bray, Grayson and Stock would support the Progressive Land Tax if it exempted city lands.  Had the Bill been allowed to be discussed no doubt it would have been somewhat amended and then accepted by the House.  The rejection only strengthened its supporters’ hands in the future.  The Progressive Land Tax was not a dead issue.

On the second motion he took exception to the vigorous attacks made on Mr Copley and believed him to be a man of principle.  He agreed that the Commissioner of Crown Lands should come from the Lower House, but also believed Mr Copley would endeavour to mete out justice to all.  Mr W.T. Rabbich moved ‘That this meeting approves of a committee being appointed to confer with other committees in other centres of population for the purpose of memorialising the Governor to dissolve the House of Assembly.  Seconded by Mr Harry and carried.
