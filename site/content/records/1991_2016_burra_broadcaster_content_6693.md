The Back to Burra Schools Committee makes an appeal for those interested in attending the reunion planned for 21-22 October to register and for help in compiling a mailing list of old scholars and staff.

Burra Branch of Greening Australia planted 500 trees opposite the Burra Hospital last weekend.
