Burra Town Council

Mr Turner has provided specifications for lighting the town.

Farmers’ Union was granted permission to build a general store.

The Postal Service.  Some changes have been made in that letters posted at the railway station without late fees will be returned to the local post office and treated as normal mail.  Mails carrying late fees will continue to be despatched and a late fee bag will be provided at the post office for mail up to 5.30 p.m.
