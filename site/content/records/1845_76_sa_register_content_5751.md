Colonists or Residents of Foreign Birth in SA.  Translated from the Sudaustralische Zeitung of yesterday.

By courtesy of the Colonial Secretary we have been favoured with an inspection of the Census Return, which allows us to present a general view of foreigners resident in the colony, including the German population.  The total number of Germans was 7,000.  Of this total 5,994 had immigrated, 954 were born in the colony and 52 were listed as travelling.    Total foreigners were 7,293.  The other nationalities reaching double figures were:

Americans	69

French	 48

Chinese	42

Hindoos [sic] 	22

West Indians	21

Swedes	19

Portuguese	11

Africans	10

Malays	10
