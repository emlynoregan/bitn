Characteristics of the 1928 paper.

Page 1

Large local advertisements with occasionally a small amount of news.

Page 2

Some large local advertisements.  A lot of stock and other sale notices, tender notices, public notices, entertainments and a few classifieds.  News sometimes starts here, but more usually on page 3.

Page 3

A few advertisements, but mostly news.

Page 4

Often half news and half advertisements, but the proportions fluctuate considerably.

Supplements

These are common, but usually they are not full sized sheets.  Most are 5 columns wide by about three quarter the normal height.

In all the coverage of local news coverage was good and quite comprehensive.  Sports were well covered and the local Council reported in considerable detail.  Editorials did not appear.
