R.T. Bowles writes re the Burra Institute:

One must gather from Mr A.A. Davey’s letter that the transfer of the Institute to the Burra Corporation has not yet occurred and that the Trustees have indicated their intention of not continuing to manage the Institute after a certain date.  While acknowledging the Mayor and Councillors’ efforts in patriotic and other directions, a matter of such importance should not be unduly delayed.  At the AGM of the Institute on 13 January 1941 it was found to be impossible to form a committee for the next twelve months.  None of the 1940 committee was willing to continue due to the state of the Institute’s finances.  It was hoped the Corporation would then take over.  The Corporation took an interest and in June a meeting of ratepayers authorised the purchase of the Institute.  On 29 May 1941 a meeting of Institute subscribers had authorised the sale to the Corporation.

Would the Mayor and Trustees be good enough to inform the ratepayers and subscribers what has transpired in this matter?
