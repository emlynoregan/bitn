Burra Centenary Fancy Dress and Window Dressing Competition

District people will have the chance to enter floats and decorated vehicles in the procession and many are expected.  It is desired to see the outlying districts well represented.  Generous prizes are offered in a number of categories, including best float, most humorous and most original.  The procession will depart the Hospital at 1 p.m. for Victoria Park and will be led by the SA Police Band.  A special Maypole Dance has been arranged by schools of the Burra District.

The Window dressing Competition will have sections for best decorated for type of shop, best decorated shop premises (outside) and best decorated Centenary Window – i.e. displays featuring phases of Burra’s development.

Souvenir Burra Centenary Buttons have arrived and are on sale for one shilling each.

The design in light blue and black features the buildings used in connection with Morphett’s Shaft.
