Burra Red Cross, AGM, 1 July.

Attendance has fallen off since the Armistice and members should know there is still much to do.

Mr Mandeville visited in August and addressed us on the work of the Red Cross in Egypt.

On 6 September Red Cross Button Day raised £594-3-3 of which £500 was sent to the parent society and a further £110 has been sent through the year.

We farewelled Mrs Thomas Sandland to Adelaide and unfortunately she has since died.

Our Assistant Secretary, Miss Edith Cave, also left the town.

We have cut meetings from weekly to the third Friday in each month.

Elected were

President	Mrs E.W. Crewes

Vice-Presidents	Mesdames J.C. Sandland, John Pearce, John Tennant [And added as a correction in the next issue, Mrs John McLaren]

Hon. Sec. &

Treasurer	Mrs C.J. Pearce

In addition to money, goods to the value of £200-£300 have also been sent to Adelaide.
