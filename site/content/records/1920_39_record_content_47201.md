Mongolata Goldfield

Clarification is made of the last report for which the reporter’s notes got somewhat mixed due to the windy conditions.

‘The Ibis’ is owned by Messrs J.R. Barker, F. Lewis & L. Gordon and worked by Messrs F. Lewis & D. Pexton.

J. Kellaway is on the Burra-Mongolata claim.  He has gone through several reefs on a 110ft drive; some with traces of gold.  He also has a 45ft drive on the claim and a 40ft open cut.

Pexton’s wide seam is carrying 30dwt not the 3 dwt reported.

Ration men on the fields receive an extra 14lb of meat a month if working underground.

Norman Pearse was given a farewell at the Cheer-up Hall on Thursday.  He will be missed in social, musical and sporting circles.  Mr Pearse who works for the Commercial Bank has been transferred to Adelaide after three years in the town.
