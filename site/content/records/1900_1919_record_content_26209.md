Fire.  Mrs Agnes Lihou’s house in Welsh Place was burnt out yesterday morning.  A few items of furniture only were saved.  Mrs Lihou placed some coals outside near a window when she went to see her daughter, Mrs Bass, in George St.  Evidently a wind blew up and set fire to some bagging and flames spread to a window and thus into the house.  Nothing could be done to save the building and Mrs Lihou, who is a poor widow with a small boy and is in bad health, is left destitute as a result.  The Mayor, Mr S. Burns, has started a subscription list to aid her.
