Burra Branch CWA held its AGM 16 July.  Elected were: President, Mrs H. Jennison; Vice-Presidents, Mrs A. Tennant & Mrs J. Allen; Secretary, Mrs A. Ford and Treasurer, Miss E. Tiver.

The Secretary presented the 28th annual report.  Membership was 66 with an average attendance of 19.  The chief money raising activities had been, catering for the October Burra Race Meeting, supper for a picture evening, three trading tables and a street stall and the Gift & Garden Requisites Stall at the Hospital Fete.  Each month two members attend the hospital and keep the mending up to date.  The rest room now has a piano â€“ a bequest from the late Miss Minnie Rogers.  The passing of foundation member Mrs J. Tennant was noted with regret and Mrs Smith, a Vice-President, has left the district.
