Riverton Town Councillors fear that a new standard gauge line between Merriton and Crystal Brook will direct traffic from the line to Broken Hill via Terowie [and Riverton and Burra].  Most Gawler Councillors are not perturbed by this proposal.  The SAR is probably the largest single employer of personnel in Riverton and also in Gawler.
