BRTBA has had a satisfying year according to President Peter Edson.  With the support of the Goyder Council and a generous donation from Burra Resident Mr Les Warnes, the financial crisis that threatened the survival of the Burra Visitor Information Centre has been overcome.  Its facilities have been upgraded and it has passport sales and accommodation bookings have been very pleasing.  Burra should be proud of the fact that the centre attracts far more visitors than many larger regional centres.  BRTBA staged Jazz in the Monster Mine and the Antique Fair and in conjunction with the National Trust held a successful Craft Fair at the Redruth Gaol.  These events play a vital role in promoting tourism.  The Association will hold an end of year break-up at the Visitor Information Centre on 6 December at 5.30 p.m.
