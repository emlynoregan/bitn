Second ‘Win the War Rally’

The Institute was crowded last Friday for the rally.  Returned men came out in force headed by RSL President, S. Hawker.  Other groups were the Red Cross, VSD, Soldiers’ Wives Group, FFCF.  The rally had been arranged by A.L. Bence, at the request of the Town Council and the RSL.  The Lord Mayor of Adelaide and Lieut-Col. Waite attended.  The Mayor extended a Civic Reception to the visitors prior to the meeting and his speech there is reported, as is that of Lieut-Col. Waite at the rally.  He said that 30 of the 33 volunteers in the past week had been accepted.  Men 20-40 could enlist, though those under 21 needed parents’ consent.  Last time it took four years to beat Germany and now she is better developed it might take five.  He called for a steady rate of enlistment.  The Lord Mayor then spoke in support of the RAAF’s need for skilled men.  Burra had contributed £4,250 towards the War Loan and £1,050 in interest free loans and £1,571 in Certificates for a total of £6,871.  Lieut. Day then spoke as recruiting officer for the district.
