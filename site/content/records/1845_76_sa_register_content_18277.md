Kooringa News, 23 February

Only twelve attended the nominations for Parliament on 20 February.

Fire broke out on Gum Creek Station on 20 February and raged all day.

Madame Corandini, Miss Chalker and Messrs Sherwin & Farquharson presented a musical festival on Monday and Tuesday.  Attendance was very small, but those there were delighted by the presentation.

A new discovery of copper has been made near Wandillah about six miles northeast of Burra.

Nothing further has been done at the other discovery and Mr Butte [sic] has gone back to Adelaide.
