Burra Football Club

At a committee meeting on Tuesday 21 September the club expelled those members involved in the incident after the Senior Coltâ€™s Grand Final.  The strongest possible action has been taken against the members concerned.  The club has written to the North Eastern Football League to ensure that an adequate suspension is maintained, not only in this club, but in other clubs as well.  The club has also written to the umpire involved apologising for the action of the members and advising him of its actions.
