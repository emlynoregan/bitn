John Riggs of Kooringa celebrates his 81st birthday.

He was born at Nowell, Dorsetshire in 1839 and migrated in 1855 with his parents in the Thomas Arbuthnot and went to Koonoona, then owned by Messrs Barnett & Duffield.  The sheep were shorn at Princess Royal and the wool washed in the Burra Creek to save on cartage.  In 1861 Mr Riggs took on management of Murkaby for the late Henry Riggs, his brother.  In 1875 he married Miss Smith of Houghton and in 1880 took up Mullaby and in 1891 was granted a portion of Murkaby and turned entirely to sheep.  He retired three years ago.  A few years ago he disposed of Mullaby.  Other properties of his now held by his sons are Lord’s Well and Bazentin, held by Arthur, Herbert & Vernon Riggs and Murkaby by A.B. Riggs, in which the late H.E. Riggs had an interest.  Frank Riggs, the youngest son, has grazing land near Burra.  Three sons enlisted in the Great War and Elliott was killed 25 April 1917.  Herbert gained the Military Medal.  There are four daughters: Mesdames F. Pearce of Hyde Park, J.E. Pearce of Kooringa, A.L. Kellock of Thistlebeds and Miss Lily Riggs of Kooringa.
