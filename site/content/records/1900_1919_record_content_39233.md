Fire Brigade.  At Monday’s Town Council meeting Cr Wicklein suggested a hose be obtained.

Cr Lane said it was a disgrace they had no fire brigade.  They had a hydrant, but not even a hose for it.  He moved they write to the Metropolitan Fire Brigade for advice.

Cr Radford supported the move, but said it was rather a bad time to do anything with the Council overdraft already at £150.  He thought a volunteer fire brigade was needed.
