Weather.  Good rains fell to the east in the last two weeks and have set pastoralists up for the next twelve months.  Most dams are full and green feed should last to the next summer.  This follows a dry period from September 1952 to September 1953, which was stated to be the driest on record.  Ketchowla for example recorded just 122 points in that period.  Rain fell last Wednesday.  Most falls varied between 40 points and one inch, but Murkaby received 220, Sturt Vale 110 and Koomooloo 156.
