Rain.  Heavy rain fell at 4.30 a.m. Wednesday in a thunderstorm that delivered 1½” in about 20 minutes with even heavier falls to the north.  Between 8 and 9 a.m. the Burra Creek came down a banker and Mt Bryan Flat was under water for several miles.  Low-lying areas of Redruth became a lake and many families were flooded out.  The peak came between 10 and 11 a.m.  The Temperance Hotel, occupied by Mrs Reed as well as the Redruth Eating House, lately occupied by Mr F.E. Bromley, the house occupied by Mt Thomas Hall and several others were completely swamped.  The premises of J. Tiver and B. Preece were surrounded by water.  In Kooringa much damage was done to roads and footbridges.  The footbridges opposite the Post Office, behind the Burra Hotel, opposite the Bible Christian Church and near the old Pig and Whistle were all demolished.  We have not heard of any personal injury.
