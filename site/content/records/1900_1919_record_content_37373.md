Robertstown-Bright Silver-Lead Mine

[I recall no previous report of its closure.]  Capt. Fowler, who has been away on holidays since the silver-lead mine closed down under exemption, has returned to the district.  He is now interested in the asbestos deposit which extends fully ¼ mile and is said to be worth £15 per ton.  The silver-lead mine is to be reopened in March when the bore arrives from Tarcoola.
