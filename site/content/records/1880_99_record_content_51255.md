Ratepayers’ Meeting.

Ex-Councillor Sampson presented the requisition for the meeting which took place on 20 September in the Institute when Dr Brummitt presided as a very effective chairman.

Mr Sampson said he had attended two or three meetings to see for himself whether the reports in the paper were false and he was thoroughly satisfied they were not.  He felt that when debate got heated Councillors said things they were later ashamed to see in print.  He could only term them a lot of _____.  The meeting of 12 September when such a disgraceful scene took place was reported fairly.  [The meeting where the Mayor called in the police.]  Mr Sampson alluded to Cr Hardy’s unsuccessful attempt a few months before to sue the editor for libel and when that failed ‘he allowed private spleen to still play a prominent part in carrying out the duties of his public position – ‘the offending councillors and the mayor had allowed their feeling to overcome their judgement sufficiently to make trouble’.

‘The Council meetings and councillors were never more grossly represented than when Cr Hardy used to write the reports. (Laughter)’

Mr Sampson then moved, ‘That this meeting hereby expresses its dissatisfaction at the conduct of the Mayor, and Councillors Parks, Hardy and Harris in conducting the business of the Town Council by excluding ratepayers from the general meeting of same.’

The more he considered matters the more serious it became.

‘On 12 September at a sort of adjourned meeting the assessment of the town was ordered and he would ask the Councillors to retrace their steps and put the town in proper working order.  (Cheers)’

Cr Walsh 2nd and expressed dissatisfaction with the way the standing committees were ignored as well as his intention to resign if closed meetings were continued.

The Mayor rose and said he thought Ex-Councillor Sampson’s remarks were uncalled for.  ‘He said the councillors were a lot of consummate fools.’

Mr Sampson denied that and Dr Brummitt supported him.  The mayor withdrew ‘consummate’.  He thought Mr Sampson could not know if reports were true by attending two meetings.  (Sampson interjected to say three.)  Amid considerable interjection the Mayor tried to defend his record.

‘He was jealous of maintaining the dignity of the town.’

Cries of ‘Oh, oh.’  He felt that Mr Sampson would have been the first to have come down on the editor.  (The Mayor kept referring to Mr Sampson as Councillor and was corrected several times so that eventually Sampson interjected: ‘Not Councillor Sampson, please; I do not wish to be mixed up with you lot.’ And later: ‘I am not so thin skinned as you are.’

Eventually Mayor Rabbich moved as an amendment ‘That a committee of five ex-Mayors be appointed to investigate the matter, and to compare the reports as published in the Burra Record with the minute book of the Burra Corporation.’

There was some dissention about the Mayor’s wish to nominate the five, but eventually his nomination of Dr Brummitt, and Messrs E.C. Lockyer, P.L. Killicoat, T.W. Wilkinson and P. Lane was agreed to and they accepted.  Cr Parks 2nd.

In his remarks he accused the Record reports of being one-sided, which caused uproar.  He considered his actions in the Council were suppressed by the editor.  He brought up the question of the stinking fish in the creek when the writer of the Record inferred that what he had said was false.’

Cr Linkson said he was not connected with the Burra Record and had always done the business of the town in the Council Chamber and was much against it being done in committee.  He and Councillor Walsh had objected to going into committee even on 15 August when not one ratepayer, not even the editor of The Record was present.  They had not been elected to deal with personal grievances.

Cr Hardy had first moved to go into committee under Section 96 and when it was pointed out this was illegal Cr Parks moved at the next meeting the same under Section 33.  He had advice that the meeting of 12 September was illegal and as this meeting passed the town assessment it was a serious matter.

Cr Hardy ascended the platform amid confusion and said: ‘I don’t deny that there is a lot of spite attached to this affair.

(A Voice: You admit the truth for once then.  Uproar and dissent.)’

The Chair ruled any discussion of spite out of order.

He claimed the Record held gross misrepresentations but he would not go into them.  In Mr Holder’s time meetings were not reported as they are now.  There had been 22 letters published in the Record and all for the other side.

Asked to withdraw his motion Mr Sampson said, ‘The vital question is whether the business of the town will be conducted with open or closed doors?’

‘Cr Parks (promptly replying) It will be open Council.’

On that assurance and with the consent of the seconder he withdrew his motion.

The Mayor named the committee and the amendment was carried.

Mr Davey had asked to address the meeting, but the chairman asked him to refrain as a committee had been appointed to enquire into the matter.

A comprehensive vote of thanks followed for the chairman.
