Ratepayers’ Meeting

28 people attended the meeting on 28 June.  Though better than the 8 at the 1952 meeting, it is still only 6% of ratepayers.

The Mayor, Mr Carpenter, reported the completion of work on the Cemetery Road (Ayers St) and Smelts Road, which had been reformed and sealed, along with the road into the school.  Work has been completed on resealing Young St at Burra North for which a special grant of £1,100 had been received. [There is no mention of Watt Rd, which was also supposed to have been covered by this grant.]  The Aberdeen and Kooringa basketball courts have been bituminised.  Thanks are extended to the Progress Assoc. for raising funds for the children’s playground equipment, which has been installed and for help in establishing the caravan park, which is now paying its own way. Thanks also go to Ron Murray for his gift of trees, which the RSL and Air Force Assoc. had planted on the eastern approach to the town.  The CWA avenue on the Adelaide Road was doing well.

Recently the Governor and Lady George visited the district for a few days and the Mayor had also met the Premier, Mr Playford, who laid the foundation stone for the new building at the hospital.

The Town Hall Pictures had been taken over by the community about 3½ years ago and was going along satisfactorily.  Several repayments had been made on the original loan.

Thanks were extended to A.A. Davey for continuing to run the excellent library and best wished were extended to his, as he had not been in good health lately.

Thanks also went to the CWA ladies who now had about £170 in hand towards a modern supper room for the Town Hall.

Thanks were also extended to the Fire Brigade, the Town Clerk E.R. Davey and Cr Fisher for his work with the Town Hall Pictures, the Institute and the High School Committee.  Also to the local MP Mr G. Stanley Hawker and to Mrs H.J.B. Jennison for her work for charity and the welfare of the town.  A small presentation was made to retiring Cr Fisher.
