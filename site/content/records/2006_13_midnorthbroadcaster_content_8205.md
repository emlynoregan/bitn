Burra Memories of the Moon

Pauline Venning (Burra):

‘I remember it very well as it snowed heavily all day.  I was also nearly due to have my son Christopher and I remember my dad giving me a commemorative medal from ‘The Advertiser.’  We were sitting in the lounge room watching it on TV and it just blew us away to think that man was actually walking on the surface of the moon.  It was really exciting.’

Ken Broad (Burra):

‘I remember the landing vividly as I was working at pruning roses and had to listen to the whole thing unfold on the radio, because my boss was too miserable to let me inside to watch it on TV.  I thought the whole event was fantastically exciting.’

Chris Queissner (Burra):

‘I was shearing sheep on Rex Stockman’s property and it was snowing and we had to contend with wet sheep all day, so I never got to see the actual landing until I got home and saw it on the TV news.  I still believe it was a waste of money that could have been better spent on our own planet.’

Jacqui Oates (Poonunda Station):

I was in primary school at the time and it snowed in Hallett, so we thought it was just a special day for us as we got to play in the snow all day.’

Elaine Ogden (Burra):

‘I found the whole day very exciting.  I was in primary school in England and out teacher brought in a small TV.  We all crowded into the class room and scrambled for the best position to see the screen – it was just fantastic.’

Kerry Spicer (Burra):

I was in primary school in Bute at the time and don’t remember all that much about it, only that it was a very important day in history.’
