Obituary.  William Jenkin Davey Jnr late AIF died at his home in Payneham on 24 April 1926.  ‘Billy’ was born in Kooringa in 1894, the eldest son on Mrs E.L. Davey.  After leaving school he entered the Burra Record office then owned by his father.  When E.F. Marston bought the paper in 1913 he and his brother Harold carried on there for some time.  Later he went to Horsham in Victoria to join the Horsham Times.  He was badly gassed on war service, the deadly effects of which placed him in Bedford Park for some time, but when he knew the end was near he was removed to his home.  The funeral was on Anzac Day.  He is survived by a wife, nee Miriam Pearce (Nurse), a daughter of Mr & Mrs Walter Pearce of Kooringa, and a son, Master Keith Davey and by a brother, Harold as well as by his mother.
