Fire.  Mr John Morgan of Baldina was driving home from Burra on Friday night and was near ‘Jilbert’s Well’ when a fire broke out in the back of his trap.  A cloak, dress and other apparel were alight and in a high wind it was difficult to put out the flames.  Mr Riggs came to his aid with water and extinguished the blaze.  It is thought that a spark from a blacksmith’s shop must have smouldered until fanned into flame by the wind.
