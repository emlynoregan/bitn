Mr Roy Sellars of Burra North has completed 60 years as a shearing shed worker.  He first began work in 1905 on Mt Bryan Station of Mr Charles Bowman.  Over the years the property has been split up, but in the past week Mr Sellars has been working in the same shed – presently owned by A.B. & B.A. Riggs on their ‘Kabymur’ property.  It is thought the property is almost 100 years old.  Roy is at present pressing bales for Messrs Riggs exactly 60 years after he first slept there and over the years has pressed bales in most woolsheds east of Burra and in many parts of the State.  The ink from branding the bales gave him the nick name ‘Inky’ and many who would not know Roy Sellars know ‘Inky’ Sellars.  It would be interesting to know how many bales he has pressed in 60 years.
