Obituary.  Florence Scroop devoted great loyalty, leadership and energy to the many organisations and sporting clubs she was involved with during her long life.  Football held a special place in her life and she spent many seasons washing and repairing jumpers and stoking wood stoves and coppers for refreshment purposes.  A Grade footballers played last Saturday at Hallett with black armbands in tribute to her.
