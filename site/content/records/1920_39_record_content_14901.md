W.R. Lee reported it would cost £17 to repair the ambulance.

District Councils will not assist in buying a new ambulance.

Cr Kellock said his wife’s ride in the ambulance was very rough: they needed a regular driver.

Cr Riggs said that in town cars could be hired.

Cr Kellaway said that cars and cabs were not appropriate in infectious cases.

Since it was obtained the ambulance has cost Council £18.  It will be repaired and District Councils will be asked to share in the cost.
