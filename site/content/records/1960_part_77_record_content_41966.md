Ambulance & EFS Building.  A tender was accepted on Monday last week for a building to be completed by 31 January 1969.  It will be situated opposite the Buffalo Lodge Hall on land leased from the Town Council by St John Council of SA and the Burra Burra DC.  The building will be approximately 40 ft x 38 ft and will comprised a Board Room, kitchen, storeroom, shower, toilet, two ambulance bays and an EFS bay.  A project committee will manage the project.  There were seven tenders and that of D.T. Jacka & Co. was successful.  Finance will come from Burra District Ambulance Assoc., St John Council Subsidy, Burra Burra DC and a subsidy from the EFS.  Building is expected to commence on 1 October.  At present the Holden Ambulance is based in a shed at the rear of the shops in Market Square and the VW Ambulance is in a building over the Red Bridge owned by E.T. Baulderstone.  The EFS Unit takes up valuable space at the District Council Depot.
