The 1986 Barrow Push may have a Texan team in the contest.  This follows the sending of a video tape of the 1983 & 1985 Pushes to Dr Ian McPhail who is organising the Texan Sesquicentenary and Mayor Brough of Kerrville, which is Burraâ€™s twin town in Texas.  So far there are 11 confirmed entries and 8 tentative ones in the 1986 Burra-Broken Hill Barrow Push.  Registrations close 12 December.
