Porter’s Lagoon.  Visitors are coming in fair numbers and the carnival will probably be held on 30 January 1928.  Some Adelaide swimmers and lifesavers will probably be present to demonstrate swimming, high & fancy diving and life-saving.  Mr J. Denton of Farrell’s Flat has presented the Boat Club with a very fine Dietz streetlamp and it has been placed on the jetty and its light makes night boating much more pleasant.  Lifebuoys have been installed on the boats.
