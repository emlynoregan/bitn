Kooringa Meeting of Ratepayers

A meeting of ratepayers was held at Banks’ Assembly Rooms in Kooringa on 17 June.  Captain Killicoat as chairman of the Burra DC presided following a requisition signed by 30 ratepayers.  Mr W.R. Ridgway said he had sketched a memorial a fortnight earlier when he heard the Council was in dispute with the Government over the North Ward.  He withdrew this, as the matter has been settled.  But it was said the Council had a lawsuit with the Government, which if true was very unwise.  The ratepayers had a right to know how matters stood.

Captain Killicoat said that c. £143 had been deducted from the grant-in –aid by the Government for a period when the Council had barely existed, before they had time to make an assessment, and now a second contribution was demanded.  The Council did not believe in paying this and had legal advice that the claim was illegal.  Council had instructed their solicitors not to go to law, but to write a letter to the Government.  The Government had offered a compromise, but they had rejected this.  Way & Symons were very strongly of the opinion that the Government had no right to deduct a police contribution from District Councils.  Cr Lane read from the Police Act a clause, which he thought entitled the Government to levy the money.  In any case they could levy it on the police district which would be all the same to the ratepayers and a 1d levy on the rate would raise the money.  He thought it inexpedient to aggravate the Government.

With respect to the Council Wards Cr Lane thought the proposed arrangements unfair, particularly to Kooringa, which produced nearly half the rates.  He proposed the wards remain as at present but giving Redruth one more councillor, thus:

Kooringa Ward two councillors

Redruth Ward two councillors

South Ward one councillor

Cr Warnes thought there was nothing in the Act allowing the District Council to spend money on police and Way & Symons views ought to count more than Cr Lanes’.  He objected to pay for a service from which he received no benefit.  Only one other Council on the colony, that of Yankalilla, was in the same position.

Mr Ridgway said outside residents gained nothing from the police.  Immunity from house breaking should be a benefit, but of six cases in the last 18 months not one had been solved.

Mr Dawson said the objects of the meeting were altogether unclear and he moved it adjourn for a week so that the objectives could be made clear to those coming a distance to attend.

The meeting resolved to attend to the matters brought before it.

The meeting then endorsed the decision of Council in agreeing to the separation of the North Ward.

Mr O. Harvey moved that the Council withdraw all proceedings against the Government.

The Chairman said that although Cr Lane had said the Council was at law with the Government, they were not.

After some discussion Mr Dawson moved that the matter be left to the Council and this was carried.

Mr Ridgway then proposed that the meeting endorse the view of Cr Lane as above on the representation of wards.  Cr Warnes amended this to leave the matter as proposed by the Council.

Mr Dawson made a lengthy analysis of where the rates came from and how the money was expended.  He concluded that Kooringa Ward got more than its share, Redruth got too little and the North and South Wards had been robbed.

Eventually the original motion was carried.
