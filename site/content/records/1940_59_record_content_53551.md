A public meeting was held at the Burra Town Hall last Wednesday with F.T. Marston in the chair, as Chairman of the Hospital Board.  He reported:

On 19 May 1950 as a consequence of a report by Dr McQueen and officers of the Central Board of Health, the Board decided to investigate the possibility of repairing, renewing, or reconstructing the Hospital.

Dean W. Berry, architect, was invited to discuss proposed alterations and additions on 29 June 1950.

A committee was formed at a public meeting on 1 August 1950 to raise funds for the proposed building, on the approval of the Chief Secretary.

The plans were received 1 September 1950 from Dean W. Berry and a joint meeting was arranged with the Fund-raising Committee.

On 15 September 1950 a meeting of the Board and the Fund-raising Committee discussed Plan A, estimated to cost £73,000 and Plan B, estimated to cost £78,000.  It was decided not to launch an appeal until the Government’s assurance of a £ for £ subsidy was obtained and it was decided to get further plans and estimates from Overall & Walkley.

A joint meeting on 23 November 1950 decided to recommend Plan B.

A deputation on 2 February 1951 was advised that the Government would give a £ for £ subsidy when the need for a new building had been established to the satisfaction of the Director General of Medical Services and the Chief Secretary.

On 2 March 1951 it was disclosed that the Government was unlikely to approve a grant by way of a subsidy in excess of £30,000.  It was suggested that the modifications to Plan B outlined by Dr Rollison be approved by the Board and if not approved, it was unlikely that approval would be given to any other plan.

After completion of the modified plan the Government would give consideration to the completion of Plan B.

The amended plan was estimated by Dean W. Berry to cost £56,000.

The Medical Officers said they were not in favour of Plan B as modified, as it provided inadequate hospitalisation and would defeat the ends of the original Plan B and be less convenient that the existing buildings.  Dr Heddle agreed to interview Dr Rollison with a view to having the modifications extended to provide adequate hospitalisation.

Dr Heddle reported on 29 March 1951 that he and Dr Rollison had agreed on an acceptable plan to be submitted to the Chief Secretary.

After considerable delay and further information the Chief Secretary advised that approval was not given for the modified plan as agreed between Drs Heddle and Rollison, but was given for the £56,000 version and that £10,000 would likely be placed on the 1951-52 estimates to allow for it to be commenced.

The Board then agreed to the amended plan as approved, with the provision that when completed the whole of Plan B would then be completed.

On 4 September 1951 Dean Berry advised the estimated cost was now £61,600.

Further action was suspended on 28 September 1951 pending up-to-date information from the Fund-raising Committee and Dean Berry was instructed to halt further action pending the Board’s instructions.

At a meeting of the Board and the Fund-raising Committee on 20 November 1951 the latter said it was not prepared to launch an appeal for the plan as approved on the following grounds:

Money was now harder to get than twelve months ago.

Costs had risen so much it was unlikely they would go higher and would possibly recede and the project should be postponed to a more propitious time.

The amended and approved plan did not have the whole-hearted approval of the Board’s Medical Officers, or the Committee and it would be a breach of faith to ask subscribers to support a fund in which the organisers had no real faith.

They were prepared to launch a fund to improve the present building and to provide adequate Nurses’ Quarters.

On 30 November 1951 Dean Berry advised the project was postponed.

A public meeting was then decided on with invitations to go to the Chief Secretary & Dr Walker, President of SA Hospitals Assoc.

Now from the Board of Management comes a suggestion that extensions be made to the present Isolation Block, which is quite modern and which currently houses the Sisters, so that it could serve as Nurses Quarters.  This would not be so very expensive and would solve that problem for all time.

Mr Marston believed the Gebhardt Estate money could be used for that.  It was not available for building other than Nurses Quarters.  The Key point is that accommodation for patients is reasonably good, but for nurses is not good at all.  He thought Nurses’ accommodation should be attended to now and additions to the main hospital be deferred until wages and the cost of materials levelled out.  If agreed to, the question of fund-raising would then arise.

Mr Andrew Tennant then moved that the Fund-raising Committee’s offer be accepted and first priority be the provision of good backs and bathrooms for the Men’s and Women’s Wards and second priority be accommodation for nurses.  Mrs Ashton seconded the motion.  Mr W. Carpenter spoke in support as did Dr Heddle.  The motion was carried.

Mr Earle then outlined a proposal to raise money by getting landowners to give the hospital the use of an area of their land for cultivation of say 20-50 acres of barley to be sold for the benefit of the fund.  The owner would benefit from fodder grass sown with the grain and from the stubble for feed.  Similar schemes worked well elsewhere.  Another fund raiser was similar to the way Legacy raised funds from selling sheep at local markets.  Both schemes will be put to the Fund-raising Committee.
