The Burra History Group has been collecting information for some years now about the district’s WWI servicemen and nurses.  The work began by collecting references to them from the Burra Record.  To make this information more useful to family history researchers we have been adding their proper name, date of birth and death where known and their parents’ names.  This has not proved to be straightforward.  Photographs of those who volunteered have also been sought.  Nice collections of photographs exist at the Booborowie and Mt Bryan Halls and when we visited the latter we found serious deterioration due to insect and water damage.  We undertook to restore the collection, but to restore the set of 35 photos we need new copies or different photos of Sister A.S.S. Hatherly, G. Prior, M.J. Griffen, A.A. Burton and F.F.W. Richards.  We also need to identify two of the soldiers whose images have lost their labels.  [Photographs printed.]  We, of course, would appreciate photos of any other WWI servicemen and women.  Photos are copied and promptly returned.
