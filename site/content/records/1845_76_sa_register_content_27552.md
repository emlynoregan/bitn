John Butler of Mt Lofty, son of the deceased, said his father was a farmer of Canowie Belt aged 60 and an experienced driver, used to horses.  He considered the part of the road where the accident occurred to be very dangerous.

Police-trooper Davis said that on seeing the body, he found the leg severed below the knee.

The jury returned a verdict of accidental death.

[Patrick Butler died 12 April 1876 near Hanson, residence Canowie aged 63.]
