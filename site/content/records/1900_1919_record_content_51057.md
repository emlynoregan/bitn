Burra Cheer-up Society.

Burra Cheer-up Ladies’ Band was invited to Adelaide to play at Violet Day there and arouse public interest.  The Military Band greeted them at the station and they proceeded to the Cheer-up Hut where they were welcomed by the Naval Band.  After a cup of tea the Ladies’ Band then marched along Adelaide streets led by the Bandmaster of the Locomotive Band, (which had also lent the use of its drums).  On entering King William Street the girls played Templemore.  They turned into Rundle St where they attracted large crowds before taking Gawler Place to Grenfell St and thence via King William St to the GPO where they paused for another selection.  They then returned to North Terrace for the Memorial Service where the Military Band played the Recessional and a bugler played Last Post with all traffic halted.  The Ladies’ Band then played the National Anthem.  The Governor and Lady Galway congratulated the girls on their achievement and they were asked to appear for the Wondergraph operator for moving pictures.

The President of the Cheer-up Society entertained them for lunch where speeches from those assembled praised Mr Bentley’s and their achievements and that of Burra and District in patriotic causes.  In the afternoon they again marched through the streets followed by half a dozen Light Horsemen leading a horse with an empty saddle.  The crowd was enthusiastic.  In the evening they appeared at the concert at the Exhibition Building where their first item was The Trail that Leads Home, followed by Little Lad in Khaki – the latter to great applause.
