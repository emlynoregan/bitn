Burra Burra DC has a new assessment and a new rate.  The new assessed value was $94,794,830.  This was an increase of 50% and had been part of a series of land assessments by the Valuer General’s Department.  The last assessment was in 1983.  Ratepayers who wished to appeal against their assessment were encouraged to call at the Council Office as soon as possible to inspect the notice.  Objections should be lodged at the Valuer General’s office by 8 September.  Mr Walsh said the rate increase had been held to an overall 7.64% as a consideration of the rural economic situation.  The estimated income from rates this year would be $557,640.  The rate for effluent drainage remained the same at $48 for households, $28 for vacant allotments and $21 for maintenance rate per unit.  The road rental rate remained unchanged.  In Burra township the minimum rate had risen from $200 to $230, from $140 to $160 for the townships of Mt Bryan, Booborowie and Farrell Flat.  Outside the townships the minimum rate was $100.
