Burra Town Council

The minute of 16 August 1948 forbidding the playing of sport on Sundays on courts leased to tennis clubs was repealed.  The clause ‘K’ of the agreement is to be amended to allow play between 1 p.m. and 6 p.m. and the amended is to be presented at the next ratepayers’ meeting.

The Housing Trust is to be advised that the Council was disturbed at not receiving a building application before building started and in future application must be made before worked commenced.
