The Smelting Company Proposal

People seem sceptical about the prospects of successful smelting in SA judging from the tardiness with which the subscription list is proceeding.  Had Mr Smith’s proposal to form a company with capital of £10,000 in £5 shares been carried into effect it is probable shares would have readily been taken up.  But when offered in the form of a subscription list a perception is that the money is being given away for a public purpose, as if for charity and that few, except those deeply interested in the mines, are called upon to subscribe, which unfortunately is delaying the carrying out of the objective.  In fact the subscribers are bona fide shareholders with their deposits paid.  We hope the public will see it this way and that the list will soon be filled up.
