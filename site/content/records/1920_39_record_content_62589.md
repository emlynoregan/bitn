‘A Resident’ writes about the Mine Bridge.  It may interest you to know that the Mine Bridge was built by the late Mr James Tiver in the late part of 1859.  The stream of water from the mine was diverted to allow the foundations to set, but during the night, whether by chance or otherwise, it flowed over the foundations, and the work had to be done again.  The next time the foundations were in Mr Tiver decided to stay up and keep watch during the night.  His wife, with true pioneering spirit, stayed with him till the early hours.  The couple took shelter near a shed where the old weighbridge stood.  [The year of construction was actually 1868.]
