Christmas Festival at Burra Hospital

The annual public festival was held on Monday last and drew many visitors from the district.  The grounds were specially decorated and lit with strings of lights along the verandahs courtesy of L. Pascoe, G.H. Dow and G. Dane.  The Burra Brass band attended.  Many seats were provided, but many people had to stand and others listened from cars parked for half a mile along the road.  G.E. Dane arranged the program.  Signor & Signora Molinari were a great attraction and Members of the Burra Institute Choral & Orchestral Classes gave great assistance.  The band is now much improved.

There was an address by Mr I.J. Warnes as Chairman of the Board of Management on the successful completion of a difficult year for the Board, which he thought would balance its budget.  The program is then reviewed.
