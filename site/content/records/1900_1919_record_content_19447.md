Inquest.  The inquest on Annie Lomman eventually was completed.  Annie Lomman, daughter of Mr Lomman of Mt Bryan East was delivered of a daughter in Thames St on a Thursday and the child died the Saturday of the following week, when it was found dead in the motherâ€™s bed.  Dr Sangster performed an autopsy, which suggested asphyxiation, but was not conclusive.  The jury found that death was by asphyxia with no blame attachable to anyone.
