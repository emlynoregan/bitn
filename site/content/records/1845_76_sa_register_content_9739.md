SA Mining Association

The eleventh annual meeting of the Association was held yesterday.  The report indicates the continuing progress of the venture.  Ore raised in the year to 31 March 1855 was 6,862 tons, the cost of production was £54,920-1-1, or £8-0-1 per ton.  The ore realised £82,319-9-9 or £11-19-11 per ton, giving a profit of £3-19-10 per ton, which gave an aggregate profit of £27,399-18-8.  To this is added the sum of £869-3-11 for rent, exchange etc. to give a profit for the year of £28,269-2-7.  From this two dividends were paid amounting to £24,640.

The yield of ore for the six months ended 31 March 1856 has been 5,450 tons at an estimated 27% copper.  This is the mine’s best result for the last four years.  For the bulk raised it is perhaps the richest yield of copper for any mine in the world presently in production.  The profit account to the end of the last quarter, based upon modest calculations as to results, and including the balance of profits from last year, is £85,654-6-0.  This is the largest sum the company has ever had at one time for division amongst shareholders.  The continuous payment of quarterly dividends is of course guaranteed by this large balance, though the amount has not yet been realised.

We have been favoured with the items of expenditure included under the heading of ‘Charges’, which show the entire cost of managing the SA Mining Association for the year from 31 March 1854 to 31 March 1855.  The management consisted of a Board of nine Directors, a Secretary, and three clerks in Adelaide; a chief Captain with three assistant Captains, an assayer, an accountant, a clerk and a storekeeper at the mines.  Thus:

Fees paid for Directors’ attendance

at meetings @ 21/- per meeting	350

Salaries of the four Adelaide officers	1,330

Salaries of the eight officers at the Mine	2,214

Adelaide office rent	125

Cleaning the Adelaide office	20

Directors’ expenses visiting the Mine	130

Officers’ travelling expenses	20

Entertainment allowance for visitors at the Mine	50

Auditors’ fees	31-10-0

Law expenses	27

Advertising & printing	210

Stationery	25

Petty expenses, postage, fuel etc.	25

Total	£4,557-10-0

The work of the year to which these figures refer consisted of supervising an average of 400 workmen employed in the production of 6,862 tons of copper ore; the preparation for market and the delivery to the Copper Company, and the receipt from them of 732 tons of copper in return, the shipment and sale of the latter to England and India, conducting the correspondence concerned therewith, the keeping of the accounts and the disbursement of £80,142, including £26,960 pf profit, divided among the shareholders in three dividends.

The expenses of management for the year just ended amounted to £5,008.  Ore raised was 9,859 tons.  Total expenditure was £127,664-11-5, including £28,015 paid in dividends.  The estimated profit for the year is set down at £81,010-17-11.  The average number of men employed was 650.
