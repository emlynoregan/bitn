Kooringa News, 17 April

Master Abernethy the ‘fattest of all fat boys’ appeared at Kooringa on Saturday and Monday.

Professor Kohler will attempt to astonish with experiments in the occult sciences on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.

Interest in the coming election has been thoroughly roused after the recent meeting here.  It is a pity such meetings are not conducted more quietly and in a more orderly manner.  Last night’s was particularly turbulent.  After the meeting the police ware needed at a fracas to part the belligerents.
