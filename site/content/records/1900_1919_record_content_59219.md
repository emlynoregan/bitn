Burra Racing Club held a meeting last Friday.

The last race meeting had shown a deficit of £42 and there was a bank overdraft of £176.  Outstanding subscriptions should reduce the deficit to c. £21.  Guarantors for the debt were sought and obtained.  Mr Tennant, the President, said a racing club that couldn’t pay its way should be wiped out.  Unless matters changed he would resign.  Major Lewis thought it could be made to work.  A small committee was appointed to work out a rescue plan.
