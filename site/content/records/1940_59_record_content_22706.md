Thanksgiving Services

On Wednesday afternoon members of the RSL and the VDC, with representatives of the Red Cross, marched through the streets to the Town Hall where one of the largest audiences ever seen in Burra gathered to join in thanksgiving for the declaration of peace, which had been made earlier in the day.

Rev. Cowle opened the meeting by announcing the times for Church Services.  The audience rose and sang the National Anthem, followed by the Doxology and a hymn.  Captain Cox gave an appropriate scripture reading and Rev. Hobbs delivered a Prayer of Thanksgiving, which was followed by The Lord’s Prayer.  Rev. Barrett gave an address on the steadfastness and loyalty of those who had brought victory and of the great sacrifices made and the gratitude earned.

Another hymn followed and then all sang The Song of Australia.

Dr Steele gave an address on behalf of the Burra Soldiers’ Welfare Committee and paid tribute to the work of the Mayor throughout the war.  He paid tribute to all the service men and women who had contributed to the victory.  Peace would see not only the return of servicemen and women, but also of those who had suffered terrible privations and cruelty as prisoners of war.  The Soldiers’ Welfare Committee would be doing its best to see that service men and women were given employment, good homes and the best educational facilities for their children and to see that the Government carried out its responsibilities to them.

The mayor then introduced Dr Toal [the Catholic priest for Burra] who paid tribute to the fallen and rejoiced with the victors.

Mr G.S. Hawker spoke on behalf of the District Council.

Mr Dollman sang Long Live the King and the audience joined in the chorus.

Mr Jennison, in speaking for the RSL asked people to pour out their money to help rehabilitate service men and women on their return to civil life.  An appeal would soon be made to create comfortable club rooms and it would be a disgrace if that appeal was not fully subscribed.

The Mayor, Mr T.H. Woollacott gave a stirring speech in which he said that promises made to the service personnel as they left would now have to be honoured.  He also paid special tribute to those who had halted the Japanese only 25 miles from Pt Moresby and pursued them through New Guinea and beyond.  He also acknowledged the efforts of Mr Churchill, the late President Roosevelt and the late Mr John Curtin PM.

The service ended with Mrs N. Pearce singing Rule Britannia, with the audience joining in the chorus, followed by a final rendition of The National Anthem sung with much feeling.
