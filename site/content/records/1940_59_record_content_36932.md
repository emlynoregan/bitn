Obituary.  The late Mr Lance Phillips, grazier of Burra, was born on 30 August 1921, the second son of Mr & Mrs R. Phillips.  He attended Morgan Primary School and later the School of Mines in Adelaide, where he obtained a certificate as a Woolclasser.  During the War he joined the AIF, but owing to ill health was unable to leave Australia.   He spent most of his time in the army as a driver in the north or SA.  After his release from Military Duties he acquired a portion of the property known as ‘The Gums’, where he carried on as a grazier until his death.  He resided with his father at ‘Studholme’.  He is survived by his parents, two sisters and a brother.

[Lance Clarence Phillips, born 30 August 1921 at Eudunda: died 5 May 1948 Studholm [sic] Station.]
