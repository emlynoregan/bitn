Burra SES will get a new $48,000 Toyota Landcruiser.  This will enable the service to cope with rugged terrain and replace an obsolete vehicle.  The new Landcruiser will be used to rescue bogged vehicles and people lost or in other difficulties.  It will have a 600 km range and carry first aid supplies, stretchers and other rescue equipment as well as radio and satellite phones.  As Controller of Burra SES Ric Williams accepted the vehicle on behalf of the town from Minister Brokenshire.  Similar vehicles have been supplied to Andamooka, Coober Pedy and Booleroo Centre.
