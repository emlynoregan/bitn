Burra CWA Branch turned 70 last Tuesday.  The CWA in South Australia was started in Burra on 5 November 1926 by the late Mary Warnes.  Sixty-two ladies attended the celebration, including the State President Marie Lally, Divisional President Roma Cook, Group President Mary Shattock and Mrs Warnesâ€™ granddaughter, Carolyn Cooke.  Burra Branch President Barbara Frances said it was sad that Burra had lost its CWA rooms in 1991.  [Photo.]
