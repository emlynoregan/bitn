[Thomas Henry Williams – see Ian Auhl The Story of the Monster Mine pages 169, 179 & 185.  He arrived on The Richardsons 3 October 1848 as Superintendent of the Smelting Works.  He held the position until resigning in October 1854 and the Superintendent’s house, attached to the Smelting Works Office, was erected for him in 1849 – and survives as a residence.  Auhl also verifies his role in founding Auburn.  Williams bought two sections in October 1849 and subdivided them the following year.  See also Manning’s Placenames of South Australia.

Montgomery is a less fruitful name.  He does not seem to get mentioned in connection with Martindale Hall.  The architect there was Ebenezer Gregg of London, while the supervising architect was E. Woods of Adelaide and the builder who completed the job in 1880 was R. Huckson.  Almost all the tradesmen were brought out from England for the job and returned after it.  My notes do not refer to a Montgomery in Burra 1876-80 and Trove, at least on a quick search, seems also unhelpful.]
