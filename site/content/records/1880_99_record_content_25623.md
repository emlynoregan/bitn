St Mary’s tea at the Institute attracted about 150 and the evening assembly about 200.  The highlight of the musical entertainment was generally judged to be the dumb charades - several tableaux - ‘Sir Walter Raleigh & Queen Elizabeth’, ‘Old Mother Hubbard’, ‘Othello Smothering Desdemona’, Queen Eleanor and Fair Rosamond’, ‘Little Red Riding Hood’, ‘William Tell and his Son’.
