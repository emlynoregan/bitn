H. Morgan writes on who found the Mongolata gold.

In 1884 the late Sir Frank Moulden was spending the school holidays at the old homestead and found small quantities of gold.  He recounted this to me in 1915 and arrangements were made then to prospect certain sections and a few weeks later he arrived with a party which camped for a week where the Curlew Mine now is situated.  Only a small amount of gold was recovered and no effort was made to locate a payable reef.  A little later I had two men prospecting on Wildildie, but again only small quantities were found.  The information about Ben Williams and William Moore may be true, but I know of no evidence to support it.  Mr Bywaters was next and though it was understood that he had found rich specimens I am not aware that any other person knew the location of his finds.  I would like to ask Mr Byles who first drove him up to the locality and if it is true that he moved his pegs three or four chains west when it was discovered someone else intended to peg on that side of his claim?  If so why?  I do not wish to belittle Mr Bylesâ€™ role because it is well known he spent a great deal of time and energy on the spot after finding payable gold.  On two occasions a group of Burra businessmen discussed taking over the claim on terms very advantageous to him, but no agreement was arrived at.  Mr W.J. Richards then came into the picture and I will say he has done more than all the prospectors or any other person to place Mongolata on the map as a goldfield.
