The Hallett Community Management Committee has decided to ask the Minister of Education to consider passing on the use and ownership of the school to the committee.  With the Council mergers the committee sees a potential for a bigger role for itself co-ordinating the needs of twelve current sporting and community bodies and perhaps being party to development application decisions, management of local assets and making formal budget decisions.

Council Amalgamation

The survey of residents conducted last week by the Hallett DC resulted in 85% of people returning responses and 52% favouring the southern option.

The interim Chairman of the new Regional Council consisting of Hallett, Burra Burra, Robertstown and Eudunda Council areas will be voted on at a meeting of the Structural Reform Working Party.  The position will be for the period 3 February 1997 to elections on 3 May 1997.  A CEO will also be appointed to commence on 3 February 1997.

The final amalgamation proposal will need to have a name for the new Council and submissions on that and on a logo will be accepted until 4.30 p.m. this Friday.
