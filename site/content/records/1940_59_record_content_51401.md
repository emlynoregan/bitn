[The report then goes on the detail costs, showing wages as 56.3% of costs.  The total expenditure was £13,723 and the income only £13,051.]

Maintenace costs had been exceptionally high because they had been neglected for many years.

The Chairman held out little hope that the deficit would be made up from the Governments at any tier of Government.  Functions to aid the Hospital would help for some very specific things, but overall he saw rising costs to patients as the only real outcome and that patients would increasingly have to look to helath insurance.

Expansion of the Hospital would yield more income, but that relied on getting more staff and that, in turn, depended upon erecting good quarters for nursing and domestic staff.  Plans for a new building [for such a purpose] had been discussed with Architect Mr Dean Berry in 1950 and plans submitted to a Building Committee in August.  The plans offered two approaches to the problem and eventually Plan B was submitted to the Chief Secretary.  He scrubbed certain parts of it and after we returned to Mr Berry Plan C was proposed.  The Chief Secretary indicated that he would approve Plan C and we would get a grant of something like £30,000 towards it.  When submitted to the Board of Management, Plan C was rejected.  Dr Heddle then took an amended Plan C to the Chief Secretary, who replied that the Director was not prepared to accept that all parts of the plan were essential.  The original Plan C was then submitted to the Board of Management and approved.  It was then sent back to the chief Secretary and the Board is awaiting a reply.   The estimated expenditure is c. £65,000.  Meanwhile the price of wool has fallen and the costs of building have risen.  The future path looks difficult.

Dr R.C. Heddle as Medical Officer reported that the Hospital had been successfully run throughout the year, that the Maternity Wing was very good and the operating theatre was fairly good, but needed certain improvements.
