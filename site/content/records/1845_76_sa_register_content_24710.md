Mt Razorback School.  Mr A. Hallett Jnr visited Mr G.R. Loweâ€™s school, which was held in a chapel four miles east of Mt Bryan Flat.  There were 34 on the roll and 20 of them had not previously been to a school.  The average attendance was 20-24, with a lowest attendance of 14.  Progress was good given that it had only commenced on 17 June.  He thought the school necessary and Mr Lowe a suitable person for the teacher.
