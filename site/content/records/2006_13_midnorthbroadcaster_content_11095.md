Accident/Obituary.  Last Friday two lives were lost on the road between Point Pass and Eudunda.  Kelly Jonas, a 30-year-old mother of two, of Eudunda and her sister Lauren Zadow, of Renmark died in an accident that should never have happened.  Both had been surfing on the bonnet of a car.  Miss Zadow fell onto the road and her sister jumped from the car and was subsequently struck by an oncoming vehicle that she was reportedly trying to flag down for assistance.
