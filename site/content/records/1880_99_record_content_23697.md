Wesleyan Jubilee Celebrations.  The church was formally organised on 11 May 1837. [So why is the celebration not being held in 1887?]  There are in the colony 74 ministers, 8,295 members, 396 local preachers, 401 class leaders, 2,350 Sunday school teachers, 18,232 Sunday school scholars and 372 churches, schoolrooms etc. with 46,576 people who attend public worship, including the Sunday school scholars.  There were hopes that the Jubilee Fund might pay off the church debt of £62,000, but the poor times have halved this hope.  Apart from crowded services on Sunday the main celebration was the banquet on Wednesday.  There were places for 140 and many non-Wesleyans were present as well.  Over 380 people paid for admission and there was a meeting later with supper for which some 200 remained.  Burra has raised £1,750 for the Wesleyan Jubilee Fund.  Included in this are the promises of Mr C. Drew of £1,000 to the Methodist Ladies College, of Messrs C. & T. Drew of £500 to the general fund and other promises amounting to £185.  The remainder was the sum collected on Sunday.
