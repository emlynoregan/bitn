The Famous No. 2 Guards’ Band paid a visit to Burra on Thursday and was the best music heard here since the visit of the No. 1 Band 12 months ago.

They played at the hospital before marching into town to ‘The Marseillaise’.  After a few selections in the street they went to the barracks for a meal.  The evening open-air meeting was much appreciated.  On Friday they went on to Yongala after playing a few tunes in market Square.
