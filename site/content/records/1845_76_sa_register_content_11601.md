It is intended to pay the usual dividends of £5 per share (i.e. 100%) on 2 June and 1 September.

A new arrangement has been made with the English & Australian Copper Co. on terms proposed some time ago and submitted to the Directors of the Copper Co. in England.

The report of the Chief Mine Captain speaks in very favourable terms of the prospects.  Another large pumping engine is expected daily.  This is expected to permit a large extent of new tribute ground to be opened up.  The cost of operations has increased in the last few months because of the necessity of repairing old sections and the employment of more tutworkers in exploring operations.

The high profit figure for 1856 relates to the high price of copper at that time.
