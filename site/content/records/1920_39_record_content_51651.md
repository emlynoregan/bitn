One remembers yabbying at Princess Royal with Jack, Jim & George Merrett who lived near the cemetery and had formerly lived at Springbank where other early families had been Bosence, Rowe, Baggs, Mosey and Berryman.  He also remembers when a boy named Knevett was lost for some days in foggy cold weather on Sugar Loaf Hill and died from exposure.  He was a bearer at the funeral along with other boys.  It was a long way to carry the coffin from the Catholic Church to the cemetery.  All coffins were then hand-carried to the cemetery except for the Welsh who had a table with an edge to hold the coffin from slipping and carried it on their shoulders.  The custom was to sing all the way to the grave.
