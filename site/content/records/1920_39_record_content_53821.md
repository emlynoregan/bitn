Obituary.  Mrs A.G. Heinrich of World’s End died 27 November after a very long illness aged 28.  She was very highly esteemed in Burra and her home district.  She was born at Manoora 11 August 1906, the second daughter Melva [Mary Riessen] of Mrs C.H. Mann of Baldina and the late Mr Riesson [sic: for Riessen].  On 15 January 1930 she married Mr A.G. Heinrich of World’s End.  Her death is a great loss not only in her own home, but in her mother’s where another daughter Miss Doris Riesson died in September 1926 aged only 22.  Just a fortnight ago the deceased said she wished to give a trophy to the Burra Rifle Club in which both her husband and she had a great interest.  She was a good rifle shot and always a competitor in the ladies’ matches arranged by the club.  She was also a worker of fine needlework.  There are no children.  Six members of the Burra Rifle Club acted as bearers.  She is survived by a husband, mother & step-father Mr & Mrs C.H. Mann of Baldina, a sister Mrs J.L. Sullivan of Reade Park and a step-sister Miss Millie Mann of Baldina.
