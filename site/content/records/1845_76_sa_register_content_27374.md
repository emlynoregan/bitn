Booborowie, 1 March.

The carters, having been paid for their season’s work have subscribed for and entered upon the repair of the worst places on the main road to Hanson [Farrell’s Flat] although the road is not properly defined.  The local DC has also called tenders for putting into order three places on the main road.

The township is in good humour in consequence of having from 80-100 heavily loaded teams coming to it in one day.  Carting has been completed on some farms so the next task of stubble burning has commenced.  The fires as seen from the high hills at night are quite imposing.  Sometimes there are fires on every side.

Most of the Government selectors in this district are fully able to buy their sections, the purchase-money for which will shortly fall due.
