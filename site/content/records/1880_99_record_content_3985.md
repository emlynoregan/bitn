Burra Railway Station.  The wants of the Burra District were brought to the attention of the Commissioner of Public Works, G.C. Hawker, by the Members of the District on 21 April.  There was a complaint about the inadequacies of the refreshment facilities at the station.  All that was available were ‘meat pies (the very idea of which was repulsive), stale dry cakes, and tea and coffee.’

Mr Rounsevell sought a licence for the refreshment rooms at Riverton and Burra and to compel refreshment rooms to supply decent solid food in the shape of chops and steaks etc.  The bad state of the Burra Station was also raised.
