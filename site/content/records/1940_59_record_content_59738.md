Burra Rifle Club held its AGM in the Fire Station.  The club was in a very sound financial position and is probably one of the few clubs without an overdraft.  Elected: Captain, T. Lynch; Vive-Captain, J. Brown; Secretary, R.G. Bernhardt and Treasurer, K. Spackman.  The new season begins on 26 July.  The Captain reported a successful year.  There had been 51 possibles scored for the year and although only three people had reached a score of 100 off the rifle, it was encouraging that they were three of the younger members.
