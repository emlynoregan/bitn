Friday Australiana Day saw visits by students from Booborowie, Hallett and Mt Bryan and Burra Kindergarten with creek tea, damper lunch, a sing-along, bush tales, bread-making, papermaking, golf, an archaeological dig and folk dancing.

There was a Teddy Bear’s picnic for the young folk and a Mad Hatter’s competition.

Miss Stratos taught Greek dancing and the whole secondary school ended up doing Zorba in the gym.

Other activities included a writer’s workshop, candle making, spinning, weaving, soapbox derby, picture framing and a visit to the school by St John’s with their vehicle and demonstration of techniques.
