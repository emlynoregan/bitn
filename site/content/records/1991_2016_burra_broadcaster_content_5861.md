Letter.  Lionel M. Young L.Th., JP of Mowll Village, Castle Hill, NSW writes with some reminiscences.

He was presently 92 and his father was Joseph Hawkins Checcuci Young, born in Burra 27 November 1868 and his mother was Alice Ada Clode born 16 November 1869.  He was related to the Woollacott family and a cousin of Stan Woollacott.  He visited Burra in 1932, staying with his Aunt Kate, nee Woollacott and also with Aunt Essie, who lived opposite the railway station.  His parents had moved to Tyabb in Victoria, where he was born 6 May 1903.  He had a sister Evelyn born 6 May 1901 and a brother Keith born 24 May 1905.

They left Tyabb when he was aged 3 and of the 8 siblings three survive.  He met Josie Battye last year at a church Friendship Luncheon.  He recalls that one of the Woollacott boys opened a college in Essendon, Victoria and another who was a Methodist minister in 1928 over there.
