Back to Willalo Celebrations on 24 February are reported in just under 1Â¼ columns.  Unfortunately after the date was set the SAR changed the Seaside Trip from the 17th to the same day.  In the morning there was a back-to-school after which they moved to the recreation ground for lunch and sports.  The sports results are printed.  A dance in the hall concluded the festivities.
