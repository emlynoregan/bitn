Mt Bryan East.  The district has seen bountiful rains with up to six inches recorded for the month.  Since last Wednesday gaugings of four inches and over have been reported.

Residents are having telephone communication installed.  The residents have erected their portion of the line to the Mt Bryan exchange, a distance of eleven miles and now await the Department’s work on its section of the line – expected ‘early in the new year’.
