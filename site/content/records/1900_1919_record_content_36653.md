Obituary.  John Milligan died at his sister’s residence in Kooringa on 20 December aged 57.

John Milligan died on Saturday at the residence of Mrs John O’Leary, his sister.  He was born in County Down, Ireland and came to Australia in the Lismoyne with his parents, arriving 22 June 1855.  [Note that this does not fit in with the age of 57 given in column 4 and cited above.]  He worked at farming with his father and later in Victoria and NSW.  He never recovered from an accident with a circular saw in June 1913.  He leaves two sisters: Mrs John O’Leary (Burra) and Mrs Donnelly (Tumby Bay).
