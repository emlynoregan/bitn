Football.  At Aberdeen on Saturday: the Second Semi-Final.

Aberdeen	0.2	2.7	6.10	6.12	(48)

Kooringa	4.5	4.7	4.7	6.10	(46)

Kooringa Football Club met on Thursday night and Mr Lawn asked why the club had failed to visit South Booborowie as arranged.  The Secretary Mr Wade said that the Aberdeen Secretary Mr Willshire had advised that the match was cancelled.  Nine Kooringa men were ready to go.  Mr Allen said Mr Willshire rang him on Friday and asked if anything had been done about the match and Mr Allen said he didnâ€™t know.

[Mr Willshire then seems to have cancelled the match without contacting the Kooringa Secretary, or at least this is the implication of the report.]
