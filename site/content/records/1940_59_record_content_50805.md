Lord’s Well & the Pohlner Estate attracted very active interest when offered for sale on Friday in the RSL Rooms.  Over 200 people attended.  Lord’s Well was sold ‘bare,’ the homestead having burnt down recently. [The price is not reported, though the report says that after £17,500 bids dropped to £250 a time till the end.]
