Fire.  A fire to burn some rubbish at the cemetery appears to have got out of control, burnt the whole area of the cemetery and killed many trees and shrubs and damaged others.  A report from the curator has been called for, as no burning had been authorised.  Council has also discussed the matter of keeping spare open graves ready and it was resolved to allow not more than two and only in areas not frequented.
