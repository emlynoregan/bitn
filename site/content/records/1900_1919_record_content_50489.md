Burra Cheer-up Society held a welcome home social for Lt Frank Treloar on Thursday evening.  On Monday there was a farewell social for Gunner McCarthy of Redruth.  Photos have been received of Ptes Dick Stasinowsky & Williams & Trooper C. Rabbich.  Sympathy was extended to the Schuyler & Carey families.  The society needs a piano, as the present one is past repair.
