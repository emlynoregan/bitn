Accident/Obituary.

On Monday 26 July a car overturned on the Black Springs Road about 16 miles from Burra and a man died from his injuries.  [That is: William Henry Patrick Hampshire died 30 July 1948 in Adelaide, residence Queensbury, aged 58.]

Yesterday another car overturned near the same spot, but about Â¾ mile closer to Burra. There were four occupants of the new Vauxhall Tourer, all from Broken Hill, and the driver, Mr Victor Grant, was thrown out.  He suffered concussion and possible fracture of the skull and his condition is serious.  The other three escaped with slight abrasions, bruises and shock: Jack May*, Geoffrey Carlton Curthoys and John Patrick Foggerty.  They proceeded to Broken Hill by train last night.  [Note: in 71, 32, 17 August 1948, page 1 this man is said to be Mayn.]
