Weather.  Snow fell on the hilltops of Burra, Peterborough, Hallett and Jamestown areas over the weekend.  Many areas received a good covering and locals took the opportunity to do some sightseeing in the Mt Bryan/Hallett areas.  A few flakes were reported in Burra itself over the night of 26-27 May, but melted on reaching the ground.
