In this letter E.E. Thamm accepts an apology from C. Tiver for an incident in church.  He says he has talked with Rev. Bridgwood over the matter.  He has never thought lightly when the National Anthem was being sung and was deeply moved for the boys at the front, having close relations in the fighting line.  He says that on reflection he will sing the National Anthem in the future and expresses sympathy for one who has lost a son in the conflict.
