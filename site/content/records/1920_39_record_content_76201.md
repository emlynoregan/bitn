Dr Steele expressed the bitterness of their hearts that such a great crisis should have been possible and called for all to carry on with their duty to maintain the strength and integrity of the empire.  H. Jennison expressed similar feelings: sorrow that nations had learnt so little from the last war, the shame of those who had allowed this war to come about and the assurance that the Empire would stand firm and united.
