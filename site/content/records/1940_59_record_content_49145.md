Burra Burra DC

A letter from the Commissioner of the SAR confirms he will not approve a railway crossing at the north end of Mt Bryan.

SAR also responded to queries stressing the attempts it makes to reduce fire hazards from trains, including spark arresters.  Only oil-burning locomotives are running on the line from 30 January.

SA Police have approved a stop sign on the main road at Mt Bryan.
