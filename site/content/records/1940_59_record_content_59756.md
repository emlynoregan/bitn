Obituary.  Ralph John Hill died on Thursday last [2 July] aged 81.  He was born at Burra 29 May 1872 and was educated at Burra School.  He worked first as a tributer at the Burra Mine and later was a miner at Broken Hill.  He spent five years there and while there began a football career that brought him into prominence as a player for many years.  He returned to Burra and drove the Burra Breweryâ€™s delivery van for about five years, going to Spalding, Robertstown and Eudunda.  When the Brewery closed he worked at different times for three of the local butchers: Messrs Truscott, Rabbich and George Lawn.  After about 30 years with them he ended his working life employed by the Burra Town Council.  In 1906 he married Miss M.D. Ockenden who died about 13 years ago.  He was a great lover of sport and was Captain of the Kooringa Football team for many years and could well hold the record for the number of years as a playing member and captain.  He was a foundation member of the Burra Coursing Club.  Even in his 60s he rode a draught horse in a race for such animals at an Anzac Sports Meeting, popular before WWII.
