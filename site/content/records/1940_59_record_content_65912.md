The Willalo Telephone Exchange

Director of Posts & Telegraphs, Mr Fountain, writes pointing out that the automatic exchange is much more convenient.  The charge is based on the radial distance between exchanges.  He says the annual rental fee of £5-12-6 at Willalo compares with £10-17-6 (or £12-2-6 for businesses) in the Metropolitan Area, which represents a good many free telephone calls for Willalo users.  Charges are uniform throughout the Commonwealth and local charges would be both illogical and unjustifiable.
