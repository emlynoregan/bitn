Mallett Athletics Club4th Annual Sports was held on Saturday last in bad weather which meant a rather small attendance at Mr H.W. Collin’s paddock.  Results printed.

Entertainments in Burra last week included a hirdy-girdy, [sic] the Cunard Family, a cheap-jack and the Marionettes.

Mr W. Pryor, the Waterworks engineer, is able to get about again with the aid of a crutch and stick.  The injury to his leg is making progress.

W.H. Hardy writes that Mayor Sampson had talked rot about the concessions not being allowed by the Act.

Clause 109: ‘Commissioner of Waterworks has power to lease the works to Municipal Corporations etc.’

Clause 110: ‘That the Commissioner has power to allow such concessions and remissions as he shall think fit etc.’

Clause 111: ‘The lessee during the term of the lease has and may exercise all such rights powers and privileges as are vested in the Commissioner.’
