Stewart Granger & Eleanor Parker in Scaramouche

Howard Keel & Jane Greer in Desperate Search

Plus special newsreel of the Final Day’s Play in the Davis Cup

Notice of an increase in admission charges from 6 March due to rising costs:

Dress Circler 3/6

Back Stalls, Adults 3/- and Children 1/9

Front Stalls, Adults 1/9 and children 1/-

[Previous charges are cited, but don’t make any sense, except that Front Stall charges seem to have increases by 3d.]
