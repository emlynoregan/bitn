Burra Burra Show Inc.  Annual Trip to Sturt Vale

Five carloads of members went out to pick up knowledge of shearing and wool classing on 4 April at the invitation of I.J. Warnes & Sons.  Sturt Vale must be one of the biggest blade-shearing sheds in SA.  The country is in excellent condition.  After arriving and having morning tea Mr Codrington from the School of Mines explained some of the whys and wherefores of wool.  About 26,000 sheep will be shorn this year and the wool says Mr Codrington reflects the season.  It is bulkier, brighter and more attractive.  Bill Carpenter served lunch (as Joe Parks was ill).  The Mayor Stan Kellaway made the trip for the first time, as did Rev. Tilbrook the first minister to attend.  Mr Codrington said he had been making the trip for 19 years.  Rex Warnes welcomed the guests.  He said where 40 acres of lucerne had been growing last year there were 1,400 this year and 1-2 tons per acre had been cut from 300 acres.  40 acres had been reaped and 40 acres kept for seed.  The lucerne was visited after lunch and after another wander through the shed there was afternoon tea before a return trip to Burra.
