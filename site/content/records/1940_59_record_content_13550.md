Tom Canny writes a long letter.  He takes issue with the Editor on the question of decentralisation, which he says the Government has always stood for.  He reminds the editor that the drift to the city has been going on for years.  In peace time farmers were being forced from farms, small businesses were going broke without any appreciable help from non-Labor Governments.  The Labor Government has now given some security in holdings and a price for produce that enables a decent standard of life.  Manufacturing of defence work has gone to country towns, though unfortunately not to Burra.   He agrees with the Editor’s article on the demolition of the Burra Mill, but says Frank Condon (Labor) tried hard to have the country flour mills used, but city interests prevailed.

The Editor points out that he did not say the Government wanted to kill primary industry: the sentence began with ‘if’.  His aim was rather to show that on the one hand a monthly market would not aid the war effort while on the other it would harm Burra’s interests.  He then goes on to agree there are good men on both sides of politics and suggests a National Government would be better in this time of stress.
