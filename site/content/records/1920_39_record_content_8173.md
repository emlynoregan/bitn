Obituary.  John Arthur Riggs died at his residence ‘Hughendon’ Kooringa on 4 July aged 83.  He was born at Nowell, Dorset, in 1839 and migrated to Australia in 1855 by the ship Arbuthnot.  Mr Riggs Sen. was employed at Koonoona Station then owned by Barrett & Duffield, who also had Princess Royal.  In 1858 Mr Riggs was sent out East to look after the proprietors’ interests there and in 1861 took over management of Murkaby for his brother the late Henry Riggs of Gawler.  In 1975 he married Miss Smith of Houghton near Adelaide and in 1850 took up land at Mullaby where he lived for a number of years.  In 1891 he was granted a portion of Murkaby Run and turned entirely to sheep raising.  Some years ago he disposed of Murkaby and five years ago handed over his interests which then included Lord’s Well and Bazentine Stations to his sons.  He leaves a widow and five surviving sons: Arthur, Herbert and Vernon of Lord’s Well and Bazentine stations, Alfred B. on Murkaby Station, Frank in Kooringa, and four daughters: Mesdames J.F. Pearce (Hyde Park), J.E. Pearce, A.L. Kellock & Miss Lily Riggs of Kooringa.  There are 12 grandchildren.  Another son Eddie died over 2 years ago.  Three sons saw service in the Great War: Elliot was killed in action 1917, Herbert won the MM, but lost a leg and Vernon won a commission in the field.
