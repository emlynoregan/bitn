‘Ratepayer’ [R. Fuss] writes concerning the swimming pool.  He is concerned that the ratepayers will eventually be dragged into supporting the pool financially.  The remodelling of Victoria Park is cited as a previous example where assurance was given that ratepayers’ money would not be involved. But the next that was heard was that ratepayers were burdened with a debt of £800 at about 3½% to be repaid in ten years.  To ease this and other matters the Council has jacked up rates to the limit allowed by the Act.  The writer’s rates rose 240%.  These debts are a first charge on the rates, leaving little for authentic Council work.  Is it any wonder, he says, that ratepayers object to any possible further encroachment on Council’s real work?  Council will be well advised to study the rates and absolutely refuse to accept any more responsibility without adequate safeguards.  Since the scheme cannot possible be a financial failure the committee should elect themselves guarantors for, say, £2,000, which the Council could draw upon to keep the rates intact.  Under the circumstances this would be a mere formality.  The guarantors cannot lose and the Council and ratepayers would be saved any anxiety.  At the recent meeting the Bank representative urged people to support the scheme.  At the same time the Council has a request from the bank to reduce its overdraft.
