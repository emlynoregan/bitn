Obituary-Accident. P.L. Killicoat was found on Thursday unconscious by the roadside close to his home, with nasty head injuries.  He was discovered by Ralph Hill: an employee of Mr W.T. Truscott.  Mr Killicoat was conveyed to the house and the doctor sent for.  He died between 8 and 9 that evening without rallying.  Mr Hill found only half the swingletree was attached to Mr Killicoat’s trap.  On retracing the deceased’s route he found other pieces by Mr W. Oppermann’s house at the bottom of a long hill.  From the marks shown, one trace had dragged and the horse had pulled the trap with only one trace.  On reaching the shallow creek the horse appears to have trodden on the hanging trace and suddenly stopped, throwing the deceased out.  The horse broke free and walked slowly home.

Mr Killicoat was born in Parranwell [Perranwell] Cornwall on 18 August 1844 and came to Australia with his mother in the Malacca when aged 10.  His father had come earlier in the Abberton with a shipment of mules from Monte Video.  Mr Killicoat Senior purchased Abberton Park which, when he died in 1877 was one of the largest estates in the district.  The deceased took over the estate on his father’s death and also held considerable land to the east.  He had been a mayor of Burra and was a member of the hospital Board for 16 years.  He was also President of the Show Society, a member of the Burra District Council and active in the Church of England.  He married in 1874 and had 5 sons and 7 daughters.  Mrs Killicoat was in Adelaide when the accident occurred.

[Philip Lander Killicoat died 14 September 1911 at Aberdeen.  The place of death would more accurately be near Redruth.]
