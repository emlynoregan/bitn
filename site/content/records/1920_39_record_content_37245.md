George Hann the son of Mr & Mrs George Hann won a bursary at the recent Intermediate Exam.  It is tenable for three years.  His brother Bill won it in 1926 and went to St Peter’s College.  He has now gone on to St Mark’s University College and passed his first year for a Bachelor of Laws Degree.  He won the Duncan Menzies Prize for best all round first year student in the Adelaide University Law Students’ Society.  Bill has also shone at football and cricket and gained a St Mark’s Bursary.  George, we believe, will continue his studies at Burra High School.
