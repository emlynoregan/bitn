Luke Day & Mrs Hester Day sued W.J. Davey, proprietor of the Burra Record for publishing a libel on 16 & 23 December 1903, referring to the cutting of a girl’s hair and putting kerosene on her head.  The court was full.  The report occupies about 3 columns.  The defendant’s lawyer did his best to give the impression that Luke Day behaved improperly towards the girl Emmie Smith.  Hester Day gave evidence that Emmie’s hair was dirty and there were sores on her head.  The girl agreed to have her hair cut and ointment was applied to the sores composed of kerosene and eucalyptus oil, in order to kill the knits [sic].

Mary Day also gave evidence corroborative of the above account.  [She says incidentally that she had lived with the Days for about 9 years.]

Emmie Smith’s evidence was that she went there willingly.  She said she did not tell Mr Davey she had done all the housework or the lion’s share of the washing.  She did not say her hair was jagged off.  She did not at first agree to having her hair cut, but later agreed.  Mr Day had never acted improperly.  She left because she got another job at Snowtown.  She had not said she was worse off than before she went there.

David Smith, the girl’s father confirmed the above.

When Emmie arrived from Snowtown for the trial she was met by Mrs Day and she and her father had then gone to Mr Winnall’s office (Day’s lawyer) and then had had a meal and discussion at the Days’ home.

The defence tried to show this was when the above story was concocted – it being at such variance with the story in the paper.

Davey said he had interviewed the girl Emmie with her sister and he took notes at the time.  He produced the notes he said he took at the time and said Mr Smith had agreed then that the information should be published.  Davey had told Smith he thought the latter had been taken advantage of because he was in Day’s debt.  The article, he said, was written without malice and in good faith.

In the end the Bench found for the plaintiff and fined the defendant £15.
