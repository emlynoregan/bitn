The Burra Community School and the Goyder Council Youth Advisory Scheme will benefit from a $100,000 funding boost announced last week.  The Reach Your Dreams grants will be offered through the Duke of Edinburgh Award.  Grants of $150 will help cover the cost of registration and the adventure section of the award.  Completion of the Duke of Edinburgh Award contributes towards the completion of Year 11 with stage one SACE accreditation.
