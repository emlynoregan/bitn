Redruth Magistrate’s Court. Before A.J. Edmunds S.M.

Aaron Lewis v. Captain McLeod (Salvation Army) and F. Harris.

Mr Pendlebury for defence and Mr Mitchell for the plaintiff.

The case was for slander on the basis of what was said at a Salvation Army meeting on 12 April.  The defendants said:

‘We have a man – or at least he is not a man, but a thug, and he is a disgrace to the uniform he wears, he should take it off at once, and never attempt to join the Army again.’

And after the meeting to a crowd at the door: ‘Come here, and we will tell you all about him.  We followed him down to Mrs Woods’s house last night, and saw him go in and the light was blown out.’

The claim was for £19-19-0.

Though the plaintiff was a ‘man of colour’ he hoped justice would be meted out to him the same as it would be if he was a white man.  The words used were malicious and wicked.  The defendants had taken it upon themselves to be detectives and spies and had held the plaintiff up to ridicule and contempt.  Plaintiff was a marine dealer.

Mr Pendlebury said they were justified and would prove it.

Lewis said he attended a meeting of the Army on 11 April at the pump.  He had joined the Army in Adelaide in 1881.  When he later arrived at the barracks the Captain would not let him speak, but said the words complained of.  The Captain also said he had heard Lewis speak to Mrs Wood’s daughter in an improper manner and threatened exposure in the War Cry.  Lewis went on to say he was now barred from places he used to get bottles from and he had his credit stopped at Luke Day’s.  He tendered evidence he had been in service as a Government constable and had been a sea faring man on the Diamontina.  He went to Mrs Woods’s to get his washing.  The candle burnt out – was not blown out and Mrs Woods replaced it in less than two minutes.  F. Harris confirmed the Captain’s report and told people he saw me ‘mugging Mrs Woods’.  Lewis admitted having had his name struck from the Army in Adelaide because something was said of his behaviour with a woman, but he claimed to be innocent of the charge – the woman did not bear a good character.  He said he had been in Kooringa for some time – most recently for three weeks and spent quiet evenings with Mrs Woods and ‘on two or three occasions’ had remained all night – taking a separate room and bed.  He later amended this to ‘as many times as you like’.

He denied being in Mrs Woods’s room and always considered her to be a lady.  He denied that he was there when a young girl was in the room.

Evidence was tendered concerning the words alleged to be slanderous and the occasion of their utterance by James Stagg, a brother-in-law of Mrs Woods and Bertha Stagg, Mrs Woods’s sister

Mary Woods was sworn.  She was the wife of Henry Woods and said she knew the defendants and Mr Lewis for whom she does washing and mending and sometimes feeds him.  She denied any impropriety – the light was always on and a door open.  ‘Lewis did not mug or kiss me at any time.’  She heard the words complained of.  Lewis, she said, always conducted himself in a proper manner.  Her husband was aware of the visits and raised no objections.  On the morning of 12 April Lewis has stayed till 2.30 a.m.

None of the witnesses positively swore that Lewis was named as the person referred to in the alleged slanderous comment.  Mr Pendlebury asked for a non-suit with costs.

Mitchell said the words were clearly intended for the plaintiff and were used maliciously and with spiteful intentions.

Mr Edmunds ruled the case should continue.

Kenneth McLeod said he did not mention Lewis or Mrs Woods’s name.  He did not say the second quotation attributed to him.  From information received he decided to find out if it was true as it is not proper to profess to be a Christian and be guilty of such conduct.  He knew the plaintiff in Adelaide to have been struck off the [Army] roll for similar conduct.  Asked Harris to accompany him.  The two of them viewed the house from the bank of the Burra Creek nearby.  They could see light and hear conversation through an open door about 9 p.m.  Saw Mrs Woods fall into the plaintiff’s arms, repeated twice.  The couple then went into the front room.  The daughter said ‘Come out of that you d----- Lewis.’

We then took ourselves round to the front, but by then could see nothing, but heard some choice language.  The girl Mary – better known as Jenny – retired, but later we heard Mrs Woods say ‘Look out Jenny, Lewis is coming.’

He then reported conversation that is unfit for publication.

Heard the girl ask Lewis for 6d.  We left satisfied the reports were true.

Mitchell cross-examined McLeod, but to little effect.

He re-affirmed that the remarks at the meeting were not specific in identifying Lewis and Mrs Woods.

Harris was then sworn and corroborated McLeod’s testimony.  He denied the second statement of the alleged slander.

Edward Phillips corroborated the statements said in barracks.

The addresses of counsel followed.

The magistrate said in his mind the plaintiff was guilty of everything he was charged with and a verdict was given for the defendants.

Mary Woods then did not proceed with a case for £5 for trespass against Capt. McLeod & F. Harris and Mr Pendlebury was awarded costs.

Jane Woods 15 years 9 months was subsequently charged, on the information of L-C Thomas, with being a neglected child.  Persons were called and gave evidence that the house kept by Mary Woods had a reputation as a brothel.  The girl was sent to the Industrial school till 18.

The evidence for this case is also unfit for publication.

W.J. Jacka, late brewer at the Unicorn Brewery was presented with an address by those employed there on Friday afternoon.  He is leaving after 5½ years at the brewery.
