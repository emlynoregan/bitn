Burra Town Council

The Council again discussed the appointment of the Mayor as a member of the Hospital Board.  The Mayor said the old board had again been gazetted without his inclusion.

[The Council felt very strongly they should be represented as the hospital is vested in the Council.]

The Mayor said the Board was believed to be about to ask the townspeople for assistance, but expected this without allowing the town representation.  The mayor had also asked why the press was excluded from Board meetings.

Cr Lane moved that the Members for the District ask the Chief Secretary to make provision for the representation of the town.
