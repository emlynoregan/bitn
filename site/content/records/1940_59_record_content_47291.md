Burra’s Production for SA

Recent wool sales show wool averaging c. £100 a bale and if this were the case with every wool sale, the Burra District would produce over £2 million worth a year.  It is certainly fair to say it produces over £1 million worth, plus meat, sheep, wheat and dairy produce.  Yet whenever Burra wants anything in the way of modern amenities that the Government could provide, the politicians turn a deaf ear.
