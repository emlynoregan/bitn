‘The Mayor, in his wisdom, put a person to carry on the works, and what is the result? According to the engineer’s report in the Record the works were allowed to go to rack and ruin.  In your last report it looks like star chamber business, and the Council is afraid to let the ratepayers know what is being done.’
