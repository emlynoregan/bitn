Burra Public School annual break-up celebrations.  It is some years since the Public School put on a concert and it says much for the work of the staff (Mr T. Swindley acting headmaster, Misses D. Baulderstone & O. Pearce and Messrs Bown & Leibig) that the program at the Institute on 14 December was such a success.  The Fife & Drum Band of 40 and the choir required much training.  The program is reviewed in about 1 column.

Qualifying Certificates were gained by:

H. Thompson	590	Joan Hann	507

Ted Fuss	577	Joyce Carpenter	504

E. Kakoschke	552	Max Blott	498

Colin Twist	552	Beth Sara	495
