Editorial on Holidays in Burra.

The Burra Cycling and Athletic Club has awoken from dormancy for Boxing Day Sports, which will be good for Burra.  Coastal towns are favoured by summer tourists, but Tanunda does well with an ‘almost Continental gaiety’ & sports & local entertainments.  Why can’t Burra do something similar?
