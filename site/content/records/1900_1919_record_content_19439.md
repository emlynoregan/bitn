Kooringa Methodist Tennis Club Concert last Friday was a cut above the ordinary.  £12 has now been raised.  Mr G. Launder’s female impersonation did not take on too well, the audience apparently being more anxious to hear his ventriloquism.  In this role he provided half-an-hour’s fun and merriment, leaving the audience wanting more.  The proceeds of the night amounted to £14.

[In view of the earlier figure this suggests that £14 was the gross figure.]
