Burra Show Luncheon

The President entertained about 100 guests.

The Hon. John Lewis MLC proposed a toast to the Burra Agricultural Soc. [The Show Soc.] and to its President.  He reminisced about early shows, recalling the first, which he thought was in 1881 in the Smelts Yards*.  He felt the one thing that was unfortunately lacking was Merino sheep.  The President had been grumbling about the accommodation at the grounds, but he thought they were lucky to have such facilities.

The President said they had built the luncheon shed, but had no title.

Mr Jenkins MP also spoke as did the President of the Belalie Agricultural Soc. (Jamestown), Mr Napper and of course Mr I.J. Warnes.

He said they had tried to include Merinos by moving the date of the show forwards and back.  They had tried having separate sheep shows with initial success, but last year had attracted the entry of only two sheep.  Though the grounds looked good on the day, if you were present during the preparations you heard the complaints and the show needed its own grounds.

[*The first show was actually in 1877.]
