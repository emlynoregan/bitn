Burra High School Break-up Celebrations

Petrol rationing reduced the attendance of out-of-town parents.

As well as musical and singing offerings, the pupils presented a one-act play and a two-act play.  In the former Ray Jennison and Ronald Pascoe carried out their parts well.  In the latter all the cast did well, with key roles played by Keith Bailey, N. Mazzarol and Ron Pascoe.

Mr Draysey reported on the year.

There was a peak attendance of 70, but removals from the town saw this number decrease rapidly.  It was pleasing to note that about one third of students came from the smaller district schools.

During the year the pupils had contributed £34-8-8 to the Schools’ Patriotic Fund and had invested a total of £76-16-7 in War Savings Certificates.

Forty-two old scholars had enlisted for service abroad.

In the 1940 examinations three students had gained Intermediate Certificates.

Religious instruction had been satisfactorily introduced this year.

The school regrets the loss due to the death of Mr P.L. Rosman, who was for many years a member of the High School Council and Secretary.

Mr Draysey said his successor in 1942 would be Mr L.J. Easson of Unley High School.

Rev. Gray then made the presentations.

Dux of the School was Rhonda Smith.  [Other awards are listed.]
