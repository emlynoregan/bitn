The State Centenary & the Jubilee of the Burra Town Council has eclipsed all previous records for celebrations.  Scores of visitors have returned to share the occasion and a wonderful spirit has prevailed.  A glorious fall of rain on Thursday night revived the herbage, cleaned the dust from the trees and cooled the air.  To date nature has smiled in the whole event.  The town is looking beautiful with various decorative schemes.  Coloured lights and lines of pennants decorate the shopping area.  The Soldiers’ Memorial and public buildings are floodlit.  The large and very beautiful cross on St Joseph’s Church also stands out.  All denominations reported large congregations on Sunday last and the Sacred Concert in the evening will long be remembered.  Monday’s Schools’ Day was an outstanding success, as was the Combined Schools’ Concert at night.  As we go to press the pageant is assembling prior to the sports at the Aberdeen Racecourse, with another Grand Concert in the Institute tonight.
