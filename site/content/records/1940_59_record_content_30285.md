Burra High School has a record enrolment this year of 83, exceeding last year’s record of 71.  The school bus from Willalo, Hallett and Mt Bryan now carries 28 High School students and several Primary School students.  The school has been improved with a storeroom built for timber and gravel has been laid on the western side of the yard.  The yard remains rough and considerable money should be spent to make it safe.

Of the eight Intermediate candidates in 1946, four gained certificates:

R. Haese 	7 subjects

J. Bourman	6 subjects

A. Anderson	5 subjects with 2 credits

G. Williams	5 subjects

Don Allen has gained a Continuation Scholarship worth £20 per annum for two years.  [And £40 if he studies away from his home town.]

In the Leaving Examination one student gained a certificate: Fayth Hawson-Clarke.
