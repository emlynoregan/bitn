Burra already co-operated with Hallett, Eudunda & Robertstown on weed control and the Robertstown Council boundary was only 10 km from Burra.

On the other hand Burra and Clare Hospitals were linked and some Burra students went to Clare schools.

The proposed representation on a merged council would be:

Burra		5

Hallett		2

Eudunda		3

Robertstown	1

Harry Quinn thought that many Eudunda electors were unaware of their councilâ€™s activity concerning mergers and many of them favoured a merger with Morgan.

It was hoped to have the amalgamation in place by March 1997, in time for the next council elections.
