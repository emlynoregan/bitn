Waterworks.  A letter has been received from the Engineer-in-Chief re a proposal to use the Wandillah Spring for a water supply.  The estimated cost would be £17,000 including 10% for interest and contingencies during construction.  The SAR agrees to pay £625 p.a. for 10 million gallons if the water is suitable for locomotives.  The Council thanks the Commissioner of Public Works and will consider the proposal.
