Burra Town Council, 20 June

C.C. Lord was granted permission for a house in Queen St to be built by T.H. Woollacott.

A piece of wall is to be made near Lewis’s Bridge to keep the flood waters in their proper channel.

The small bridge near Robertson’s is to be replaced.

The bridge near Wicklein’s is to be repaired.

A special grant of £200 for flood damage is to be applied for.

The Mayor raised the town lighting question.

The Town Clerk said lighting cost £102 for six months, for which the Mayor said they got the worst lighting of any town in the north.  A satisfactory electric lighting system would cost upwards from £7,000 or £8,000 because the town was so scattered.  Delco had just produced a system that would run 600 lights.  They would need two plants; one for each end of the town.  The Company would put in a plant on trial for six months and remove it free of cost id unsatisfactory.  The two plants would cost £1,400.

All possible particulars are to be obtained.

There was considerable discussion whether the Council was getting value for money from its workers, who got 12/6 a day with six paid public holidays and one week holiday at full pay per annum and sick pay at half pay.
