Weather.  Rainfall at the end of the weekend across the Mid North and Upper North ranged from 90 mm to 125 mm.  Dams have been filled for the first time in years and plenty of summer weeds have suddenly appeared.  Some minor flooding also occurred and the Barier Highway was closed for a time due to flooding at a number of creek crossings.
