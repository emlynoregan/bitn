Mt Bryan School.  The school oval was opened recently by Mr A.L. Collins in the unavoidable absence of Mr Lew Gare.  The land had been donated by Mr Lew Gare and the cricket pitch and a cricket set was donated by Mr Collins.  Busy bees erected the gates, fencing and posts.  Mr W. Muller, the Head Teacher, thanked Mr Collins and Mr Gare for their generosity.  Mr Bryan and Booborowie Schools played a game of cricket in the afternoon.
