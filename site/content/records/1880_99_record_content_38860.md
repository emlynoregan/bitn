Trees.  In the year 549 were planted: 52 in East Ward, 41 in North Ward and 426 in No. 2 Reserve at Redruth.  The trees and carriage cost £12-3-5 while other costs brought the total to £47-5-10.

c. 500 trees planted previously had died and were replaced.  Subscriptions of funds for trees totalled £47-5-10.  The planting of No. 2 Reserve was planned to be the School’s Arbor Day, but it was wet and so were two other days chosen and eventually it was abandoned for this year.
