Burra Men’s Shed took another step closer to reality after a successful meeting in the Bowling Club on Wednesday 29 August with men from Mt Bryan and Booborowie also present.  Sixteen men attended.  Verna Saunders and John Monten from Lower North Health conducted the meeting and asked those present what they would use the shed for and what equipment they would need.  A working group will keep things moving until a lease can be signed off on by the Department of Environment and Heritage.  They will seek to source members and equipment, etc.
