The Burra Show was held on Saturday in ideal weather and takings at the gate were $826, only $200 down on last year’s record at the Copper Festival Weekend.  The Hon. T.M. Casey, Minister for Agriculture, opened the show and advised the society that special subsidies available previously only for new buildings were now available for upgrading existing buildings.  He was welcomed by President Graham Kellock.  Thanks were especially extended to Darrell Field for his work as Secretary and Roy Humphrys for maintaining the grounds.  Local shearer Keith Walker won the Open Section of the shearing competition and I. Kessell won the Novice Section.

Baby Show photos are published of William Duncan and of Simon Drew with his mother.
