Redruth Court, Chinese Puzzles.

[The story is quite difficult to piece together from the evidence, but it appears to be something like what follows.]

Lock Sing seized a horse, cart and harness from Charlie Fie.

[Lock Sing had recently been awarded £48-12-0 from Fie in a court case.]

Then Billy Short claimed that the horse was not Charlie’s, but his, because he had bought it from him when Charlie had needed money to send to China.

Though his evidence was far from clear he said he gave £6-10-0 for the horse.

(Although Fie had owed him £2 for rent of his garden it was not deducted from the sum for the horse.)

It appears that Sampson had seized the horse. (Presumably acting as agent for Lock Sing.)

Short then bought it and returned it whence it had come.

Last month when Fie lost his court case against Sing he lost everything and gave up renting the garden from Short, who then let it to Ah Gow who had previously been employed by Fie.

Jimmy Gully was then sworn as a witness to the sale of the horse from Fie to Short.

August Fuss also gave evidence he had signed the receipt as a witness, but had not actually seen money change hands.

Charlie Fie was then sworn and admitted selling the horse to Short, but also admitted using it for his own purposes afterwards.

Ah Gow said he used to work for Fie for £1 a week, but now he was employing Fie for 15/- a week.

Mr Downer, for Lock Sing said the whole story was a sham to cheat his client out of the fruits of his claim.  No one could believe either Short or the Chinaman [Fie].

Mr Packard for the complainant did not speak.
