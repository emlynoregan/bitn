Burra Primary School Committee: Chairman Ron Moreland’s Report

The work on the school roads was started on schedule and with very satisfactory results.  Sports day was a great success and the Welfare Club ran a successful stall.  Arbor Day saw trees planted on the oval and in front of the school.  On 28 October the new library was opened by the Director of Education Mr E. Mander Jones.  The passing out parade was held on 15 December with Mr Farrow, Headmaster of the High School.  For the second year in succession we have had a teacher transferred within a week of commencing first term.  This is most undesirable, but answers from the Department have been neither helpful nor very satisfactory.  The long process of painting the building inside and out has resulted in a work of credit to the painters.  The creek through the oval is now ready to be levelled over thanks to donors of filling.  Halbury School Committee, teachers, pupils and parents visited on 3 March.  During the year we lost the services of Secretary Mr D. Bannister and we were fortunate that Mr L. Moore, manager of the Savings Bank, filled the position.  The Andrew Tennant Award is the first award the Primary School has received.  It was an award of $400 on which the amount is about $20 p.a.  The first award has gone to Ann Brak.
