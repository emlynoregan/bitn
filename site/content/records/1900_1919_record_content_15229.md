The Motor Car and the Horse.

A local storekeeper’s horse saw something very rare in Burra on Saturday, but it didn’t strike him as being very acceptable to the eye, so he decided to ‘do a get’, taking the hospital road for it.  The introduction of Dr Sangster’s motor car was the cause of the trouble, though nothing serious happened; this was owing to the smartness of Billy Barkley jumping on a sort of offspring of a motor, and overtaking the animal just as it was meditating about seeking admission to the hospital for treatment for nervous debility.  The quadruped was taken back to the shop and cautioned.  No damage was done; therefore Billy has no need to raise the price of groceries.
