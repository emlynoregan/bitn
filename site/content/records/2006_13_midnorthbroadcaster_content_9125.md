AGL expects to realise an $88 million development fee from the sale of its 132.3 MW Hallett 4 wind farm at present under construction on the Hallett Hill Range about 40 km from Burra to Energy Infrastructure Investments (EII).  This is a similar arrangement structure to AGLâ€™s sale of the Hallett 2 Wind Farm in September 2008.  EII will fund all remaining development costs.

AGL now has 900 MW of capacity currently in operation.

Hallett 2 wind farm of 71 MW and Bogong hydro power station of 150 MW are due to be commissioned in late 2009.
