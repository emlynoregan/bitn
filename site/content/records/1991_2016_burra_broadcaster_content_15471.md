Eudunda CMC.  An information night in preparation for the formation of a Eudunda CMC will be held in the Eudunda District Hall on 26 February.

The Lower North Farmsafe Group was established earlier this month.  The aim of the ‘Farmsafe’ network is to co-ordinate farm health and safety programs in local communities and regions.  There will be an interactive display at the 1998 Stud Merino Breeders Field Day at Burra on 16 March.
