CWA.  Mr Wilkinson has written off the rent on the previous rest-room for the quarter still owing; an action much appreciated.  Mrs Jettner described how to prepare sheep skins so that wool can be cut off for use in mattresses, eiderdowns, cushions, etc.  (Low prices mean that many sins are not being sold.)  Making soap from fat was also discussed.  Mrs Jettner described how to scent it for toilet soap.  A concert at Leighton has yielded Â£5-13-0 towards the Outback Relief Fund.
