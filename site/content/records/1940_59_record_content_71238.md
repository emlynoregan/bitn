Accident.  Helen Collins, elder daughter of Mr Murray Collins, was severely burned on Friday 6 January.  She was lighting the fire with the aid of what she believed to be kerosene, but which was methylated spirits.  This exploded, setting fire to her clothes.  Mrs W. Winchester heard her screams and was able to smother the flames, but the girl was severely burnt and so were Mrs Winchesterâ€™s hands.  Helen is recovering in hospital.
