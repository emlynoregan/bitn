The Burra Show was reported in the ‘Garden and Field’ as the best country show of sheep.  Also the large number of horses were commented on, and the fowls were hardly beaten by the Poultry Society’s show in Adelaide.  There were complaints though, that in some sections prizes were won that were merely bought by those entering them - this applied for example to some entries in the fruit, vegetables and flowers sections.

‘We say distinctly that is not honest.’  It is not within the spirit of the grant made by Parliament to include material from outside the district.  This is fine for exhibits ‘not for competition’, but for such prizes ought not to be awarded.
