Accident.  Ian Allen, youngest son of Mr & Mrs J. Allen Jnr, suffered slight concussion and abrasions when his bicycle collided with the car of Mr Jim Waters at the top of ‘Sara’s Lane’ [Drew Lane] on Monday last week.  The slight curve in the road appears to have hidden both parties from each other until the accident occurred.
