Burra Picnic Race Club: President John Maidment’s Report

We have been through another successful year; our fifth.  Much is owed to the efficiency and keenness of the committee. Sponsorship by the traders of the town has been vital.  The profit this year was $6,163.  Of this $2,100 went to the Flying Doctor, $1,500 to SES and $356 to the CFS for radios.  That left $2,207 which will be used on improvements to the track.  We hope to hold a country style dance at the Town Hall on the long weekend in October.  This will raise money to help organise the next race meeting.
