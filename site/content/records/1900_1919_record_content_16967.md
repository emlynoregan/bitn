A Race of Sorts!

There is a humorous account of a race held at Finch’s paddock between A. Moore’s Dick and Mr Ward’s Honeyboy.  There is a lot of humorous discussion about the antics in getting to the starting line.  At the start Honeyboy tossed its rider and headed for home.  Dick meanwhile got off to a confused start, but eventually ran the mile in 6½ minutes and won, having galloped a while, then cantered and finally trotted home.  Eventually when the laughter subsided the race was restarted and this time they both got away, but once again Dick won easily.
