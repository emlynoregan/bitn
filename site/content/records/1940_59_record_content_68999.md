‘Burraite’ writes saying the Mines Department must have records of the body of ore still in the Burra Mine and if it is not sure, why not spend £1,000 to drill and prove it – or does politics enter into it – especially when two Americans came for a few hours and then pronounced that ‘there is no copper there’. 

‘I believe they are supposed to be rather clever, but not that clever that they can tell what is under the ground.’
