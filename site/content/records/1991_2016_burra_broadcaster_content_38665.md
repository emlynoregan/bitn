THE LAST ISSUE OF THE BURRA BROADCASTER

[Jill & Terry Wilson recalled the last 13 years of the Burra Broadcaster.]

It is 13 years since we came to Burra.  Burra had not then had a newspaper in the traditional sense since the closure of the Burra Record in 1977.  It took some time for us to resurrect something that was more than a newsletter.  The Burra Broadcaster grew out of change.  When the somewhat uncomfortable merging of Councils occurred in 1997, the new identity forced some Burra locals to have a closer association with the other regions, especially to the south.  In 2001 we saw the Eudunda and Robertstown communities were largely ignored by the press, despite the best efforts of their locals.  We took the opportunity to broaden the paper for the whole Council region in a new-look tabloid-sized publication.  In the middle of 2003 the Peterborough Times was included with the paper as a wraparound to the Broadcaster with its delivery late on Wednesday in that town.  From next week with the new owners and management, news from the north and south will be included in the general news of the paper and circulated together.  While we move on to another chapter of our lives, we are at ease leaving the business in the hands of the new owners.

We thank the community for their support in business and personally and we wish the new owners well.

We will remain as residents of Burra.

Jill & Terry Wilson.
