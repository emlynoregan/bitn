Kooringa News, 28 May

The weather this last week has been very cold and the rain has at last come, with many heavy showers on Saturday and Sunday.

Nothing has yet been done to repair roads in the town and as a consequence of the rain they are already in a muddle, as is the road between here and Kapunda.

Business here continues very dull.  Men are continually leaving for the Wallaroo Mine and the Northern Mines.  Only the pastoral interests are looking up.
