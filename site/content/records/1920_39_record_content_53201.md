There was debate about trees and the need to trim some and replace others.

The Mayor thought that ‘crates’ [i.e. tree guards] were out of date and a post either side allowed trees to grow straight and provided them with better light and made cultivation of the ground easier so that they grew better.

Cr Riggs said in his part of the town wandering cows still did a lot of damage.  He moved that action be taken to abate this nuisance.  Passed.

Cr Dow wanted the town gardens put in order.  They needed regular attention rather than major work after being allowed to fall into disorder.  The Mayor said they couldn’t afford the sort of attention he sought.  Nevertheless, it was resolved to employ a man to tidy the gardens and plant new lawns in the Kooringa gardens.
