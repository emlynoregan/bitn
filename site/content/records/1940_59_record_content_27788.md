Burra Centenarians.  Two Burraites will celebrate their centenaries this month: Mr Solomon Williams and Mrs Klaffus.  Mr Williams, who celebrated his 100th birthday on Friday now lives at Glenelg, but lived for many years in Chapel Street.  He was born on board a ship en route from England to Australia.  Mrs Klaffus will turn 100 on 27 August and still resides in Burra.

Mr Jimmy Doe, another old Burra identity has passed his 95th year.  He now lives in the City, but several of the older residents will remember him running a barber shop in the premises now occupied by Miss Halliday.  Our late friend Mr Dick Pascoe learnt his trade with him.

[Solomon Williams died 30 January 1948 at Glenelg, aged 101.

Wilhelmina Matilda Klaffus died 7 January 1947 at Burra, aged 100.

James Edward Dow died 9 April 1948 at Broadview, aged 97.]
