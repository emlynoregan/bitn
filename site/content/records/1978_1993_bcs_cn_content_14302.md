Burra School & Community News

The publication is at a crisis point financially and at this critical point an appeal is made to enable it to continue.

There is a call for donations from:

Individual families â€“ asked to contribute $12 per year or 30c a week.

Sporting bodies to make donations appropriate to the amount they use the paper for promotion of their group.

Individuals using the printery if they require typing.

Clubs and organisations using the printery for minutes and group information.
