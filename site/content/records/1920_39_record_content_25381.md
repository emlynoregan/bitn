Burra Motor Sport Club

The opening competition of the club was held on 18 December 1928 when a reliability test was run.  They appear to have gone to Black Springs, Robertstown, Point Pass, Eudunda, Bower, Mt Mary, Morgan, ‘The Gums’, and Burra.  Most competitors rode motorcycles, though Mr Rooke drove a Baby Austin.  Dick Moore had a minor accident and ended in Morgan Hospital and the Secretary also had a minor accident.  Six competitors got through with full points: T. McWaters, H. Zadow, R.A. Lewis, Mr Rooke, H.E. Finley & W.E.D. Young.
