The Old Mt Bryan East School was the venue to officially open the Heysen Trail Huts last Saturday.  The huts provide accommodation for hikers on the Heysen and Mawson Trails and have been developed over the past seven years by the Outdoors Recreation Unit of the Office for Recreation, Sport and Racing.  They were opened by the Minister of Health and Aboriginal Affairs, Dr Michael Armitage.  So far ten huts have been established and eventually seventy-five will be placed a day’s walk apart along the trails.  Each has basic cooking and sleeping facilities and rain water tanks.  The first hut was Mayo Hut in the Flinders Ranges – officially opened in September 1988 – a former pioneer settler’s cottage.

[The article then goes on to give details of funding and which groups have done the work.]

The Mt Bryan East School was built in 1884, opened in 1885 and closed in 1947.  It was vacant until acquired by the National Trust in the early 1970s, but unfortunately the Trust lacked the funds to restore it and so it was transferred to the Department of Recreation & Sport in 1990.  [Photo.]
