Burra CWA will make its headquarters at the Town Hall.  They will use the Lodge Room, a portion of the room at the side entrance to the hall and the adjacent passageway.  The CWA will furnish, paint, install a stove and sink, lay water on and generally improve the rooms.

Cold Storage & Ice Works

Huge loads of rabbits have been coming into Burra.  The rabbits are put into clod storage and then shipped by semi-trailer to Adelaide.  The cold storage is to be put on a proper footing by Messrs C.H. Cummins & E.G. Franklin of Adelaide, both of whom have been employed by William Angliss Ltd.  Ice will also be made on the premises and the works will run 24 hours a day.

Burra Town Council

The Town Clerk Mr E.R. Davey said he had been given information that the Highways Dept. was to build a bitumen road from Booborowie & Spalding to feed the North.  He wondered if Burra was being passed by.  A letter from the Minister for Local Government on 4 February 1946 said a Saddleworth to Burra road via Black Springs was a priority, but nothing has been heard lately.  Mr G.S. Hawker MP will be asked to find out why there is no action despite the Burra road being part of the main route to Broken Hill.

The response from the Local Government Minister on using rating on unimproved land values is non-committal.  The Government was considering increasing the maximum rate permitted by 33⅓%.  Several country councils operating on unimproved land value were in a desperate financial position, though city councils seemed to be doing better.

Local Board of Health

The tendering out of scavenging in Burra was discussed, but no decision was reached.

Burra Homing Club.  The Saturday race from Wolseley was won by A.H. Broad.

Burra Rifle Club.  For the first time ever a possible was scored on the 900 yard range by Ron. Kellock.  The 5th stage of the E.C. Collins’ Trophy saw top places go to R. Kellock, J. Robins & R. Melrose.

Salvation Army Self Denial Appeal will include a Button Day on 12 September.

A. Coverdale writes expressing the view that Burra owned enough white elephants without buying the mine.  ‘The Mine is dead so is Johnnie Green, R.I.P.’  As the Bible says ‘Let the dead bury their dead.’
