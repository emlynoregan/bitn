Obituary.  Thomas Bray Rogers died at Blackheath NSW 5 September.  He was the third son of the late John Rogers of Baldina.  He subsequently became a farmer and miner.  He enlisted with the Bushmanâ€™s Contingent and served through the Boer War after which he travelled extensively in South America, Mexico, North America and finally married and settled in Canada.  In 1915 he enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Forces and served until the Armistice without serious casualty.  He then returned to farming.  On the death of his wife in 1925 he returned to Australia with his two sons aged 8 and 4 and a daughter aged 2.  The daughter died suddenly at sea.  He settled at Broken Hill and married Mrs Eva Bray and bought a small property at Blackheath.  His sudden death was a shock to friends and relatives in Burra.  He was a brother to Mrs E. Oates and Mrs Walter Pearce of Kooringa.
