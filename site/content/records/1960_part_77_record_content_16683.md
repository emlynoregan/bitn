The Grand Elephant Race

Messrs Bence and Flaherty raced elephants from Ashton’s Circus down Commercial Street at 5.15 p.m. on Tuesday.  The aim was to raise funds for new toilets at the oval.  Sahib Bence drew Jahore and Sahib Flaherty drew Jumbo.  There was a preliminary canter from Jennison’s Garage to the Post Office, where the race proper began.  In the run back to the garage Jumbo looked like an easy winner at first, but Sahib Bence drew big Jahore to the outside and with more courage than control went on to win by four lengths.  Sahib Bence’s descent over Jahore’s head and down its trunk was most undignified, but can be excused on the grounds of youthful exuberance and the flush of victory.  The collection for the event amounted to £23-12-0.
