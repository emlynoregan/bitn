Letter.  Chris Reed writes suggesting there are two questions Burra ratepayers should ask their Councillors:

What is the reason for the differential rates?  (Burra 0.6662 cents in the dollar and Eudunda 0.38 cents in the dollar)  What justifies it?

When the Councils amalgamated [in 1997] it was a commitment that the Council would work towards a rate parity over ten years â€“ why has nothing like that been achieved?

The Rate Review Report seeks to address the first question with its unique service charge proposal, which if adopted will again penalise Burra with another unfair tax on top of the already flawed differential.
