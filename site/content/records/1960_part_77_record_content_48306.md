Mr Allen MP asked in Parliament shy the road eastward between Glenora and Murkaby Stations – about 25 miles – had been upgraded.  There had been complaints re destruction of too much vegetation and the dust created.  The Hon. Robin Millhouse said the road served a number of stations to the east and into NSW as well as providing links to the north to the Terowie and Broken Hill Road.  There were no plans at present to extend the up grade any further.
