Proposed Kooringa Mechanics’ Institute

A public meeting of more than 90 persons was held on Friday 6 June in the large room at the Burra Hotel.  J.W. Macdonald took the chair, introduced the subject and called upon Rev. Wright to speak.  He moved ‘That this meeting views with deep concern and regret the absence of all means of providing instructive recreation for the inhabitants of the Burra, and the consequent loss sustained intellectually and morally by those whose education has hitherto neglected and by many others whose hopes and opportunities of improvement are thus destroyed and taken away.’  He went on to address these issues with an emphasis on the moral advancement that such an institution might encourage.  He said: ‘Knowledge of letters was good, knowledge of things better; knowledge of principle better still; but knowledge of a creator best of all.’

Mr Motley seconded the motion and spoke warmly in its support.  It was a project to which he would give his utmost endeavour to drive forward.  The motion was carried unanimously.

Rev. Ibbetson moved the second motion: ‘That in the opinion of this meeting, a mechanics’ institute is much needed in this township; and that it would if established be eminently useful in improving the morals, promoting the comfort, increasing the information, and securing the good order of the people.’

He was glad to see so many present and thought the only obstacle was the securing of money for the project.  On his visit to Adelaide he had raised the matter with the Secretary of the SA Mining Association, who had spoken favourably of it, and he was sure that the Association would not only subscribe towards it, but contribute annually.  He had also spoken to the Governor who was also in favour and would like to see more such institutes across the colony.   Mr Ibbetson understood that the Government would assist in their establishment and support.  He had also spoken to the Manager of the English & Australian Copper Co. and the Secretary of the Adelaide Philosophical Institute.  He thought it important to be in connection with a mother Institute, from which they might expect to receive papers to be read at the proposed institute.  There were people in Burra who could deliver lectures, including lectures on scientific subjects.  The proposal was to erect a room to hold 300 persons, with a dwelling of three rooms attached and that adult classes and singing classes should be formed.  If they could raise £200 from the community and £200 from the two Companies they could then ask the Government for £400 to total £800.

Mr Genders seconded the motion, which was carried unanimously.
