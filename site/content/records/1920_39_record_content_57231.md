Burra Town Council Ratepayers’ Meeting was held last Tuesday.

Only about 8 ratepayers were present at the tart and numbers were about 15 by the end.

The Mayor was disappointed at the turnout and the apparent lack of interest.

The Mayor’s Report

The town has a well kept appearance, though still suffering the effects of the depression and the low prices for wool and wheat.  Many men are still unemployed, though Mongolata has absorbed many of the unemployed and will, I believe, eventually be an asset to the town.  Five new houses have been built in the year.

I have made every effort to aid the unemployed and received £426 from the Government as a special grant.  This has been distributed equally amongst those on rations.  About 44 men are now on relief works.

Public work this year has seen many roads and footpaths repaired and bridges re-decked and repaired.  Sara’s corner has been improved and many new signs erected to benefit the travelling public.  The Main Roads are in good order.  Extensive alterations were made to the Rotunda.

Deputations

On 13 July 1934 I invited the Premier, Mr Butller, and The Minister of Labour, Mr Jeffries, to visit Burra and received £300 from the Premier and other benefits.  Four deputations from townspeople have been received in the year.  Cr Jeffery and myself waited on the Minister of Public Works concerning getting the Aberdeen Ballast Quarry re-opened.

Distinguished visitors have been the Premier, Hon. R.L. Butler; His Excellency the Governor, Sir Winston Dugan and Lady Dugan.  The Waikerie Band also paid a visit.

The Town is in a healthy state and every effort has been made to control the stray dogs and cattle nuisance.

The Unemployment Relief Committee is doing good work supplying clothing, boots, flannelette and blankets at Burra and Mongolata and in helping to find work for the unemployed.

We are now beginning to plan for the State Centenary and the Diamond Jubilee of the Town Council in 1936.

[After the report there was discussion and questions from the floor.  A considerable part of this concerned the number of Council employees and how Council jobs were distributed in a time of economic depression.  The poor state of the cemetery and how this might be improved also attracted attention.  The Mayor commented on how change to the law affecting hawkers would have an effect.  He also considered that the law disenfranchising those who did not pay their rates produced unintended injustices during a period of depression.  A person with four or five properties might pay all his rates except a shilling on one and yet lose his vote, while another person who paid only the minimum rate on one property got to vote.  He thought the Government had treated Burra fairly with its £426 grant.  Burra, he said, should play a significant role in the state’s Centenary Celebrations in keeping with its large part in the state’s history.]

Cr Dow said he had been criticised for proposing the Mayoral allowance be increased to £50, but he knew the Mayor’s expenses were not nearly met by his allowance.

Cr Jeffery spoke in favour of changing ward boundaries to include ‘New Toorak’ now in East Ward.  To get there residents had to use North Ward Roads and their interests were mainly in North Ward.

Cr Kellaway was not opposed to changes to ward boundaries.  He also spoke disapprovingly of hawkers.  He was personally opposed to Sunday sport, but would leave it to ratepayers’ consciences.  He felt that the system that meant that men not on rations could not be helped at all was wrong, but they had to work within the system.
