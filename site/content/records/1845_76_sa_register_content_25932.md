A Trip Through the Northern Areas

[The writer waffles on for half a column before saying much of note.  He then describes what he saw on an after dinner stroll in the moonlight.]

A three storey mill of a calibre not seen out of Adelaide appeared.  Even in the bright moonlight it wasnâ€™t easy walking over holes three feet deep.  Looking around it was possible to see development which private capital has effected worth thousands of pounds, but the Government has as yet done positively nothing.  Since I was there I believe 30 men have made a start on Ellen Street, but I fear it could have used two or three hundred.

[He then goes on about the great deal of grain grown in the north and the total lack of Government capital in railways and little more in roads.  He then carries on a discursive discussion on the need for infrastructure including the extension of the telegraph system.  The absence of proper police stations and their attendant facilities is also dealt with.

[Continued 5 October.]
