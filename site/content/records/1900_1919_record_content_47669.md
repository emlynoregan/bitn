A Girls’ Patriotic Fair was held in the Institute on Friday under the auspices of the Salvation Army, assisted by representatives from other churches and over £46 was raised.  The Mayor opened the fair in the absence of Mrs J.M. McBride, who was unable to attend because of Mr McBride’s ill health.  Ensign Day had organised the event.
