Burra Town Council 4 April.

The Mayor reported the approval of the £500 loan and that the bonds had been issued and the money received.

The Waterworks Committee advised that Wards be charged 3/- per 1,000 gallons and the banks of the reservoir be sown with couch grass.  Watering trees in parks to be charged to the Parkland rate and in streets to wards.

The shaft complained of in the last meeting has been filled.

About 50 trees from Dr Brummitt have been planted in the Welsh Place Reserve.

The revised estimate of receipts and expenditure is printed and was adopted.

Cr Ridgway moved Council withdraw from the Corporations Association because membership cost £10-17-0 p.a.  To be decided next meeting.

Council has dispensed with the solicitor’s retainer.

The Hydraulic Engineer writes that no arrangements can be made for any alteration in the machinery for the pumping station.

The Government wrote that a road having been proclaimed and handed to the town in lieu of the road on which the Burra Station was built and the old road not being metalled; there was no claim for the construction of the new road.

The Mayor said that that was no reply to their report and a memorial will be prepared outlining the case again.  Dr Cockburn will be asked to present it to the Government.  The letter received was an evasion of the question.

The Government said that the constable would be sent back, but no deduction would be allowed on account of his absence - he had been absent for four of the six months charged for.  A memorial will be prepared for this matter too.
