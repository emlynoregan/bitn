Mr Hill was given two weeks notice as an employee before he began his scavenging contract.

The question of licensing drivers within the town was referred to an ordinary meeting.

There was a great deal of argument over the Town Clerkâ€™s salary and this was not helped by the way it was introduced and handled by the Mayor.  Finally it was resolved to refer the matter to the Finance Committee for a report.
