The Mayor agreed that the petition was a slur on the Ward Councillors and those presenting it should have known that the correct thing was first to approach their representatives.

It was received on the casting vote of the Mayor.

A petition was presented signed by Mrs Sara and 17 ladies asking for the use of a certain portion of land to the left of Gully’s Wharf after crossing the creek from Aberdeen, for use as a croquet lawn.

Received.

The Mayor said he and Mrs Sara had inspected the block near Mrs Reed’s residence.  The site was well suited and there was a little unclaimed block and the Council would have to close two bits of useless roads.

Cr Riggs thought the whole Council should inspect the site as it would involve two roads permanently and that could be awkward in the future.

Cr Woollacott moved the request be granted.

The Town Clerk said the Council could charge rental for a lease on the unclaimed allotment or collect rates on it.  The roads had not been used for 70 years.

Cr Riggs continued to be concerned about the road closures and Crs Pearce & Collins were unsure about there being sufficient space.

An inspection was set for 7 a.m. the next day with the request to be granted if the inspection was favourable.

Mr Lomman of Aberdeen was permitted to erect a motor garage.

200 yards of metal are to be raised for the Railway Station Road to ease the unemployment.
