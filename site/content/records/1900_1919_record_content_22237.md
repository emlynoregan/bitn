Mr Thomas Rosewall celebrates his 74th birthday.  He has been 61 years in Burra.  He arrived on the Trafalgar and worked at the Princess Royal Mine and then at Ulcolta.  He was living in a Burra creek hut when the great flood washed the family out together with their clothing and furniture in 1848.
