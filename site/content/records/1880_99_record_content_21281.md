2nd Leader on The Aberdeen Reserve.  The move to bring the Aberdeen Reserve under the Real Property Act is most likely an attempt to establish title when the Council has a stronger one.  It is likely an attempt to bluff the Council.  A public meeting has endorsed the Council’s entering a caveat on the title.

If a caveat is not lodged the Council is just giving away the £70-£80 it cost to fence it.  Mr Pinch thought they were throwing good money after bad and opposed the move.  Cr Tiver said his experience of going to the Supreme Court over land he had bought from the same proprietors suggested there was no sufficient title to any of their land.
