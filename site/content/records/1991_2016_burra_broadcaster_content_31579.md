Telstra held an information meeting at Burra Town Hall last Tuesday on their ADSL & ISDN phone and internet service.  ISDN type phone connection is available within 17 km of a telephone exchange and offers a faster and more reliable phone hook-up than standard dial-up. ADSL service is not available to country towns.
