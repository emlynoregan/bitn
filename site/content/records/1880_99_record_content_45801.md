F. Schutz:

I came across the bridge alone.  I heard nothing and did not break the lamp.  I saw the policeman on the north side of the footpath near ‘German Ullman’s’.  [This would appear to be the footpath on the south side of the street.]

Since L-C Thomas said he was sure Halls broke the lamp and yet the evidence of witnesses was strongly against Halls being the culprit, the SM said he considered Halls’ explanation satisfactory and as the policeman himself did not consider Schutz guilty he had no alternative but to dismiss the case, though he refused to award costs.
