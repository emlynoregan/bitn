Ratepayers’ Meeting at the Burra Institute last Thursday.

Over 200 men and a number of ladies attended.  Mr Bednall was voted into the chair.

The Mayor’s Report [A.B. Riggs]

Over £3,000 in new building approvals was reported despite the depression.

The town remains clean and well kept.

The General Account started in credit £141-11-4 and ended in deficit £57-2-7.

The Government Grants account began in credit £130-10-3 and ended in deficit £195-1-4, but with spramex and asphalt on hand worth £120-7-6.

Little has been done in the Parklands this year.

The Fire Brigade has put out an unusual number of fires and well justified its expense.

The cemetery was well kept, but suffered some vandalism.

Local Board of Health reported no serious outbreaks of disease, but whooping cough visited many homes.

The main roads are in good order and the main road west from the hospital for 40 chains to the Farrell’s Flat corner was bituminised, as also was the Bon Accord Bridge.

Major Public Works:

New road to the station was bituminised.

The footpath from the National Bank to the Post Office was bituminised.

So was the footpath from the Sunday School to Radford’s corner.

48 chains of road from the Young St Ford to the Racecourse Gate were bituminised.

A new road was made in Graham. [East of Burra Creek.]

Three employees were put on part time; losing on week in four.

Casual work was found for 63 men during the year at a cost of £282-17-3 for 397 days’ work, including those who worked out their rates.

A pound was established near the depot and a pound-keeper and assistant ranger appointed.

Income & expenditure figures are printed.

Ward accounts:

North Ward	in credit £14-15-0

East Ward	in credit £86-0-0

West Ward	in deficit £15-9-1

The Mayor felt that during his terms the work of the Council had gone on comfortably if not always unanimously.  He was not satisfied with the position of the Depot with respect to North Ward.  He considered Councillors should put the town as a whole ahead of the Wards they represented.

Not all Councillors agreed.
