Council Amalgamations

The southern group of Councils has approached Hallett to enter into merger discussions.  Last night Jamestown and Spalding met with Hallett Council even though they are well advanced with their own merger talks.  A large number of Hallett residents seem to favour a split in the district with some area going north and some south, but Peterborough Town & District Councils are unenthusiastic about that idea.  The southern option seems the only one still viable.  Eudunda is arguing with Saddleworth-Auburn over an area of land near Marrabel and this may slow an outcome for Burra.  It is hoped to present options to residents by the end of May.
