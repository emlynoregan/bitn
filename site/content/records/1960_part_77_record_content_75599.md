Ruth Trevivian nee Glenister1 contributes an article: ‘Memories of Burra’.

She was born in Darton Cottage – formerly Dr Sangster’s [Sen.] residence and her sister was born in ‘Bleak House’, the former Mine Hospital.  She recalls Granny Howell2 living in a cottage a few yards from Darton Cottage, who said she had originally come from England as a lady-in-waiting to someone of high rank.

She remembers getting fitted for shoes at Pederson’s.  Her father was the Choir-master at St Mary’s; he had sung in St Paul’s Cathedral in London before leaving England.  Mr Graham Dow was then organist at St Mary’s and the ministers were Revs Hopton3 and Hewitson4.  A small boy pumped the organ.  She recalls being taken over the Black Bridge to the Chinaman’s Garden5 for vegetables [in Kingston Street] and also being taken for an afternoon walk by a girl from the Reformatory (when Miss Bubb was Matron) and how the girl dumped her on a windowsill of a stock firm for a moment’s rest and the window breaking.  The girl flew along the wide street with her and she can’t recall the outcome.  She remembers the Misses Ethel and Lily James behind the haberdashery counter at Drew & Crewes and Miss Tiver in the dresses and hats department.  Miss Gert Pearce was a reporter and Mr Marston the editor at the Burra Record.  Mr Parks the baker looked like a ghost, standing in his doorway with a big white apron and hair and eyebrows white with flour.  The boys rocking the swing bridge made the journey home uncomfortable and swaggies asleep on the creek banks frightened her when she was on her own.  The creek ran and they caught frogs to release in shop doorways – unbeknown to her mother.  She recalls Mr Wicklein the jeweller, Mr Walker the shot outfitter [sic-?] and Mr Stan Lane the saddler. Mr Streicher’s waxed moustache fascinated her.  She recalls Mr Pearce’s furniture shop with its smell of sawdust and a cat snoozing in the sun and old Mrs Pearce sitting inside the doorway.  She recalls also Pompey Pederson6 and his speedy entrance into Burra after racing from Adelaide.  And the earthquake.  And the tragic death of Mrs Lafsky, who did their washing and was killed at a railway crossing on her way home from one of the stations7.  Other names she mentions include Killicoat, Hann, Dane, Winnall, Jarrett, Pickering, Maundrell, Murphy and Mr Hogg, whose wife was a Belgian.
