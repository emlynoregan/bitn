Michael Roberts was charged with not taking a direct line to market with 5,000 travelling sheep as required under the Act.  He said that although guilty it was an unintended offence.  He explained that he was a stranger to SA and in attempting to change from Jamestown Market (which was full) to Crystal Brook he had doubled back.  The ranger was clearly not buying this excuse, but the bench which could have fined him £50 settled for £2-10-0 plus costs to bring the total to £4-8-0.
