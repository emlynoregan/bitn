Burra Cheer-up Ladies’ band and several gentlemen motored to Morgan last Saturday to assist in Anzac Day celebrations there.  After dinner at Lambert’s Hotel they went to the Institute where the band played the National Anthem before leading the street parade.  J.E.H. Winnall gave a patriotic address in the Main Street in support of the RSA and so did I.J. Warnes.  £5 was raised in a few minutes.  There were sports and a Queen Competition in the afternoon followed by tea at Lambert’s.  The Band also took part in the evening entertainment at the Town Hall after which there was supper and a return run to Burra.  About £200 was raised.  I.J. Warnes financed the Band’s trip.
