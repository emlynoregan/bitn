Central Road Board

A communication was received outlining the Surveyor-General’s report on a matter raised by Mr Cole MP.

‘There is a portion of the main line of road from the west boundary of the Burra Special Survey remaining undefined, and as the Burra proprietors repudiated the power of the Government to reserve roads through their lands, and destroyed the survey-marks made by the department upon the ground, it is only reasonable to suppose that legal access may at any time be cut off from the confirmed portion of road within the block, and that consequently it is only prudent to delay works until the whole of the line through the blocks has been properly defined.’

It appears that the work described in Mr Coles’ motion is now being carried out, but the Board referred the matter to Mr Macaulay.
