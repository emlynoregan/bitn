Burra Town Council, 21 September.

The Mayor reported that on 11 September he had waited on the Conservator of Water and had spoken with him about the need to re-timber the Waterworks shaft.  He agreed to accede to the request and forwarded a detailed account for information.  He also undertook to inspect the plant etc. when the renewal of the lease comes up and to consider the value of the capital account.

The Commissioner of Public Works was absent so the question of the Bon Accord Bridge could not be dealt with.
