Burra Progress Assoc. will sponsor a dance in the Town Hall on Christmas Eve.  There will not be a pageant or other function.  At the recent elections on 24 November H.J. Topsfield was elected Association President and there were no nominations for Secretary.  Mr Ron Wickes will continue pro tem.  Rumours for some time have said Burra is to get a new post office on the land next to the Billiard Saloon, with the present building remaining as the telephone exchange, but nothing has been done for some time, so the Federal Member, Mr Downer, will be asked to find out when the building is to be erected.
