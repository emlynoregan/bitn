A Public Meeting was convened by the Mayor at the Institute last Friday, 7 Oct., in response to a requisition.  About 70 attended to discuss the issue of protection.

Cr Anderson was voted into the chair.

T.W. Wilkinson said they had assembled to protest the proposed tariff.  The inconsistencies and unfairnesses were much discussed and the fact that it was not really protection to tax items that could never be made in SA - merely a way of extracting money - often, or generally, from those least able to afford it.

The motion against the proposed tariff is long and detailed and was passed without dissent.
