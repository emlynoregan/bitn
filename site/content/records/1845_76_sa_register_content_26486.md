‘Stuck on the Road’ writes re the Mt Bryan Road.

The road is a miserable quagmire for half a mile north and half a mile south of the Mt Bryan Hotel.

‘It is decidedly impassable for any traffic.  Carts and buggies get bogged, horses floundering in the mud, not being able to keep their footing.  Poles of wagons are broken, and their wheels buried to their axles, the poor drivers wading knee deep in mud.  There cannot be a worst piece of road in the colony.’

Considering the heavy traffic, it is a disgrace and if immediate action is not taken no wool or wheat will be able to come down this coming season. In heavy rain it is more like a river than a road, with water reaching from fence to fence for a mile in length.
