The Victorian Picnic at Redruth Gaol

A little before 8 p.m. there was a spectacular fireworks display for fifteen minutes.

The Council had set aside $10,000 for this event.

The following bush dance was attended by c. 300 people who swung to the music of The Wild Matildas and Dick Frankel’s Jazz Band.
