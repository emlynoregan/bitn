Floods.  ‘The floods have done serious damage in the neighbourhood of Kooringa.  Seventy-five of the habitable grottoes in and about the banks of the Burra Burra Creek were destroyed, and the tenants unceremoniously expelled, but happily without loss of life.  Thirty families were temporarily accommodated in the large building known as “Robin’s Stables”.’

Fry, the maniac murderer, was seen on Thursday in the scrub near his own station by some bullock drivers.  He was nearly naked and carried a rifle, a brace of pistols and the long knife with which he killed the pony.  Mr Harris, of Watervale and John* Humphrey, of the Burra Burra, have been in pursuit of him.

[* Ian Auhl has, on his copy of this article, a hand-written amendment saying ‘James Humphrey’.]
