Burra National Trust has written to the Burra DC offering suggestions about the Market Square re-development.  The Trust was concerned that it had not been consulted about the plans and while they supported the re-development in principle, they were concerned that the Council seems to have accepted inexpensive light poles without making an effort to see what else was available.  President Maureen Wright said at present it looks like an aluminium jungle.  Council had decided to use slate salvaged from the foyer of the school rather than pavers.  The Trust was certainly pleased to see the undergrounding of the power supply.
