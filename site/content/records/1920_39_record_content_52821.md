Bylesâ€™ Mongolata GM Co.  On checking rumours of a rich find we learn that a lode about 20ft wide has been struck and tests suggest it should yield up to 10dwt per ton, which is a good value for such a wide seam.  Some directors have subsequently paid a visit.  (D.R. Reid & A.A. Thornton accompanied by I.J. Warnes.)
