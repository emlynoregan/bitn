Military Camp.  Last year the annual military camp was held at Clare.  Cr Jennison reckoned it brought about Â£1,500 into that town.  Some 600-700 troopers were involved.  He wanted the Sports Syndicate to permit the use of the racecourse and for Council then to extend the invitation.  Council endorsed the concept.
