The 1995 Mid North Games are now over and have been hailed as a success.  Some 2,300 competitors took part in 26 sports over five weekends, using 32 venues in Burra, Clare, Jamestown, Farrell Flat, Sevenhill and Spalding.  The Games will be rebranded in 1996 as ‘The Australian Country Games’ – which SA Tourism Commission feels has the potential to attract more interstate competitors.
