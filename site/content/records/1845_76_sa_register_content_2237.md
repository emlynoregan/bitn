The Kooringa Wesleyan Sunday School celebrated its first Sunday School Festival [Anniversary] on Easter Monday.  At 1 p.m. upwards of 140 of the scholars were assembled on the chapel grounds and, headed by Rev. J. Harcourt and local preachers and Leaders of the Society, were led around the town.  The Chapel choir attended and at several places on the route they halted and sang several hymns.  The procession was also enlivened by other appropriate pieces of vocal and instrumental music.  Tea and cakes were served on return to the chapel.  Afterwards teachers, parents and friends took tea together in the chapel.  A public meeting followed.  The secretary reported a Sunday school of 160 students and c. 30 teachers and officers.  The funds were flourishing; £30 having been collected since the school was established in December last.  A library is being established and £12 worth of books has already been procured.  The new schoolroom is nearly completed.
