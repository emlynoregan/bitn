Booborowie Arbor Day

Sixty-five years ago Booborowie students would plant trees and then climb to the top of Collin’s Hill for a scenic view of the town.  They would then be dismissed for a half day holiday.  This custom was revived this year and Mr Ashley Woodgate, who was one of the old students who used to climb the hill on Arbor Day, told today’s students that the plantation of trees on the western boundary of the town was the result of trees planted on previous Arbor Days.
