Adelaide Merino Ram Sales saw an Argentinean buyer bid $102,000 for a JC & S 55 ram from Collinsville.  The previous record was $79,000 for a Collinsville ram sold in Adelaide in 1981.  The ram will go to an AI program by Goyaike Breeding Society in the SW of Argentina.

Joe Burke of Wyoming USA bought one ram from East Bungaree and 12 Collinsville rams for a total of $284,600.  Collinsvilleâ€™s first pen attracted his highest bid of $66,000.
