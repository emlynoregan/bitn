Kangaroo numbers have risen following reasonable rains over the past year.  Andrew Michelmore is a professional shooter based in Burra, who says numbers have increased so that they are seen everywhere to the east.  He is currently working on Collinsville Station 60 km northeast of Burra.  In large numbers kangaroos can cause major damage to farming and pastoral properties, ruining crops and competing with livestock for food and water.

Andrew operates four or five nights a week.  The meat is sold to Macro Meats, the largest processor of kangaroo meat in SA, who purchase kangaroo meat from some 30 or so shooters.  Other operators in the area are:

Mark Brooks at Hallett

Terry Skelton at Glenora

Damien Miller & Rick Murphy at Koomooloo, Yunta and Sturtvale.

Kangaroo harvesting is undertaken by licensed shooters with permits issued by State authorities to work where it considers kangaroos are causing damage.

Carcases are tagged and checked to ensure legality and skins are exported to tanneries and leather works in Europe and SE Asia.

The Broadcaster reporter went on a shoot:

Requirements are that kangaroos are hanging on the truck and bled within three minutes of being shot.  After twelve carcases were hung, the shooter stopped to dress them – heading and gutting them in turn.  The second dozen came in less than half an hour.  They were western grey kangaroos weighing up to 40 kg.  Shortly after midnight they had a full load of 43 and they returned to weigh the catch and to the chiller.  Throughout the night’s hunt Andrew had only needed a second shot once.
