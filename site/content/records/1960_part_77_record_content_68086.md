Burra Burra DC

Building permits will be required for all building in the district from January 1974.  (Previously required only in town areas.)

The Town Clock will arrive in a week or two.  A site for it has not yet been finally settled.

Some preliminary investigation has been made into the structure of the Kingston Street Bridge, allowing water to remain around it.  Final plans will now be made.

First royalties from the Mine will be paid in the next two or three months and though not large, they will increase as the Mine increases production.

Mt Bryan Recreation Ground and Farrell Flat Institute have been transferred to the Burra Burra DC.

The new toilets and washrooms at the Town Hall are nearly finished and are usable.

The obscuring of natural light in the Library as a result of this construction will be attended to.
