Burra Mine

The workings at the mine have been subjected to vandalism.  On Sunday evening last several bags of ore, each weighing about 1 cwt were moved about one chain and mixed up.  Some of this was thrown in a hole and one missing bag is thought to be in the pool.  A wheelbarrow was thrown down a 10ft shaft and tools scattered.  Two dray loads of earth were dumped into a shaft 10-12ft deep.  A series of rocks were dislodged from the cliffs and could have killed young men who often swim in the pool.  The names of those who did this are known.  Recently similar acts of wanton destruction were done at the Aberdeen Ballast Quarry.
