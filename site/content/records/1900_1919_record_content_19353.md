Burra Defence Rifle Club.  A meeting on Friday at Lord’s Hotel considered the resuscitation of the Defence Rifle club.  J. Pearce took the chair and Captain Scott proposed the formation of the BDRC.  The Military Department was currently paying much of the expense of erecting rifle butts and gave a per capita grant and certain rounds of ammunition to ‘efficients’.  Subscription was fixed at 5/- p.a.

Election of officers: Captain, George Lord; Secretary, Mr Penrose.

Committee: Messrs T. Broad, J. Pearce, G. Herbert & C. Parks.  Mr Tennant will be approached for permission to select a suitable range on his property.

[This activity seems to have been sparked by ‘so much talk about the Japs invading Australia.’]

The old mounds are still intact and awaiting duty, ‘but I don’t know that the old range is the best for the purpose.’
