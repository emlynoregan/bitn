A Bolt.  A horse attached to an old prospector’s buggy bolted on leaving the rear of the Royal Exchange hotel on Thursday.  The driver was swept off by the clothesline causing the horse to take fright.  It went up Morehead St, around Rabbich’s house and then down between C. Lawson’s & H. Austin’s butcher shop and along the main street into Young St where the buggy was smashed on a tree.  The horses were caught some distance along the Mt Bryan Road.
