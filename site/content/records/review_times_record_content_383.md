Booborowie History

Booborowie was first opened for pastoral settlement in 1843, but not until 1846 did two brothers William J. & John H. Browne apply for an occupation licence.  Later in 1848 a further licence was applied for the area north of the Broughton adjoining the run granted to Messrs Browne in 1847 to the westward.  These two areas are now Booborowie.  The name is an Aboriginal word for round water hole.  The head station was located on Section 1000 and consists of an area of around 80 acres.  It was purchased at auction by James Brown for £80.  In 1851 waste lands of the Crown leases were issued in lieu of occupation licences and lease 130 (Booborowie) was granted to William and John Browne.  This originally comprised 153 square miles.  Two square miles were added in 1860 and on 17 December 1863 the Hundred of Ayers was proclaimed, within which Booborowie is located.  It was subdivided into sections and land was first offered for sale in 1864.  Most sites were bought by the Browne Brothers.  The south portion was re-subdivided and sold by Arthur Scott Browne of Buckland Filleigh Co. Devon England in c. 1910.  The northern part was sold by Percival John Browne and Arthur Scott Browne as executors of W.J. Browne who died in 1894.  It was bought in 1897 by Henry Dutton of Anlaby and George Melrose of Ulooloo.  In 1910 the land was offered for sale by Messrs Dutton and Melrose to the Government.  The offer was accepted and the land subdivided as North Booborowie Estate and sold under close settlement agreements.

The township was proclaimed 29 March 1877 and surveyed in the same year by W.H. Cornish.  The first building was the Methodist Church erected in 1891 at a cost of £194.  It was leased by the Government for use as a school for 27 years.  A prosperous town developed as the climate and soil favoured sheep and cattle.
