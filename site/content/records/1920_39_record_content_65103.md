Mrs T.W. Charlesworth was given a farewell by members of the Kooringa Methodist Ladies’ Guild last Wednesday, prior to her removal to Balaklava.  Mrs Charlesworth has been a popular performer at both Redruth and Kooringa Guild functions with her elocutionary skills.  Many Redruth members also attended the farewell.  Mrs Charlesworth had also taken an interest in the Kooringa Girls’ Comrades Club.  A presentation was made of a crystal vase.  Mr Charlesworth was much appreciated as a Choir member.
