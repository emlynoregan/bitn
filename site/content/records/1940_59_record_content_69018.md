Asbestos deposits at Robertstown are to be investigated by the SA Department of Mines.  On 29 July an area was reserved from the provisions of the Mining Act, which prevents others from pegging claims in the area.  Senior Geologist L.W. Parkin thinks there is every possibility of large tonnages of payable economic grade asbestos being mined.
