Obituary.  Isaac Killicoat was buried yesterday.  He was born in Perranwell, a village in Cornwall 5 miles south of Truro on 3 December 1809.  As a youth he went into mining and attended night classes for an education.  At 19 he became a superintendent of operations employing 500 hands.  For 19 years before migrating to SA he was Surface Captain to the Tresavean Copper Mine, Gwennays, Cornwall, one of the oldest and largest copper mines in England and the second in the world to introduce a ‘man engine’: i.e. a lift to lower miners into the depths of the mine.  This whole time he walked 5 miles ‘back and forth’ as the Cornish say, or 10 miles a day.

In 1848 he was engaged by John Schneider & Co., later the Patent Copper Co., to come to Burra and superintend the purchase of ore from the SAMA and others on behalf of the Smelting Co.  This he did till the mine closed.  He also bought land and grew wheat and hay.  More recently he bought Abberton Park, named after the vessel he came in, and devoted himself to sheep.  He also used irrigation there to grow fruit trees, especially oranges and lemons.

He was active in public life and greatly encouraged the completion of the Burra railway.  He stood for the Legislative Council once when the whole colony was a single constituency, but was not elected.  He was appointed a member of the first Burra District Council and elected chairman thereof.  He was also elected a member of the Midland Road Board: an office he held until his death.

He did much to establish the district’s roads and bridges.  On mining matters he was a consultant, making two trips to New Caledonia to confer on the Ballade Copper Mine and also to Cobar Mines in NSW as well as to mines in New Zealand and was consulted by the owners of the mines on Yorke’s Peninsula.

He was a member of the Church of England and a trustee of St Mary’s, Burra.  Thrice married, his third wife survives him.  His eldest son has been dead for some years, but he is survived by two sons, three daughters and 22 grandchildren.
