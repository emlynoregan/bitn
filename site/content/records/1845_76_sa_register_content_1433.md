SA Mining Association Second Annual Meeting of scrip holders at the Auction Mart Tavern in Hindley Street. After some dissension Mr Beck presided.

Mr Stocks said that as a consequence of his resignation as Resident Director it was necessary to change the rules of the Association and he moved that in future the affairs of the Association be managed by nine directors instead of eight and a resident director.  Carried.

Five directors retired: Messrs Stocks, Paxton, Featherstone, Bunce and Allen.

Ten [sic] candidates offered themselves.  [Though only nine are then listed and voting returns also cite only nine candidates.]

They were: Stocks, Paxton, Addison, Johnson, Ellis, Allen, Brown, Featherstone and Neales.

At this point Mr Smith objected to the voting rules being followed and proposed a new scale.

The Chairman ruled him out of order.

Mr Smith asserted that the present rule was illegal because in law no partner in a concern was entitled to more than one vote without the concurrence of the whole.  It was monstrous that any one gentleman should be able to come into the room with an overwhelming number of votes and thus by the accidental power of wealth, arrogate to himself a larger measure of sense than he (Mr Smith).

Cries of ‘Hear, hear’ from Mr Graham.

Mr Smith said he did not speak personally [of Mr Graham] but of the principle.

The Chairman repeated that he would not receive any motion on the subject.  They may discuss the voting scale when the Deed of Settlement came before them.

Mr Smith thought that too late, of course.

The results of the voting were:

Paxton	1,764	Featherstone	639

Stocks	1,650	Johnson	488

Brown	1,348	Addison	424

Ellis	1,150	Neales	330

Allen	892

The Deed of Settlement was then produced and Mr Bayne began to read the massive document.  Soon after the start Mr Featherstone objected that he for one found it impossible to follow its complexities and objected to not having the leisure to peruse it.  Dr Addison and Captain Hall agreed it would take a week of leisure to become conversant with it.  Mr Stocks said that even a lawyer could not give an opinion of it from a hasty reading and he would not sign it without reading it.  It was agreed to have it printed and a committee was appointed to go over it, to receive objections etc. and to make recommendations to the Directors.  The meeting was adjourned to 19 May.
