War Matters

Mr Hartley Harris writes of good time in camp.  There is a movement to get the boys from Burra, presently in camp, back for a day or so for a send-off.  Mr F.C. Harvey of the Bank of Australasia is volunteering and Lieut. Copley is to go with the 3rd Contingent.

St Mary’s Church parade in aid of the Burra Hospital was held last Sunday.  The Light Horse, Cadets, & Friendly Societies marched to church from the rotunda via the hospital.  The collection totalled £7-8-6.
