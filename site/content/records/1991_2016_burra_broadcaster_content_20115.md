Décor Made Easy is celebrating its 12th birthday.  The business began as a general furniture shop in part of what had been Matthews Emporium in Burra.  It has evolved into a specialised regional service with a market extending from Port Pirie to Adelaide and with the sealing of the Morgan Road is extending to the Riverland.

Just over 12 months ago the firm expanded with a static display and sampling area in a store at Jamestown.
