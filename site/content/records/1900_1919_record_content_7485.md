The Child Vera Edwards, on the way home from school, scrambled onto a scarifier being towed behind a wagon.  She then fell and was caught by one of the tines and dragged over 20 yards before her screams and those of bystanders were heard by the driver.  Her clothes were damaged and it is a miracle she was not badly injured or killed.
