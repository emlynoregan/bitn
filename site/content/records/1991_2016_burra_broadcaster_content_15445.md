Burra & Districts Obedience Dog Club has collected nearly 30 tonnes of newspapers and cardboard for recycling.  Fourteen tonnes have been taken to the recyclers with a further fifteen tonnes at O’Connor’s Shed.  Last week both Adelaide and Melbourne recycling depots announced they would accept no more newspapers and cardboard until an enormous backlog had been cleared.  The club has therefore had to cancel their monthly kerbside collection.  This will also affect Hallett, Booborowie and Mt Bryan.  [Photo in O’Connor’s shed.]
