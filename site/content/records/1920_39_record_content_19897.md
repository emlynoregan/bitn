Collins of Lucernedale Station, Mt Bryan

This was a 1¼-column reprint of an article from Saturday’s Advertiser.

Henry Collins of Lucernedale is still breeding sheep at 93.  Two years ago he paid 4,000 guineas for a stud ram.  He first took land near Mt Bryan almost 70 years ago and has concentrated on stud sheep for 50 years.  His sons John, Maurice, Arthur and Horace inherited his enthusiasm.  Buyers now come from as far as South Africa.  Three rams each costing 4,000 guineas or more have gone there in the last few years and one buyer paid 275 guineas for a Collins’ ewe.  Others have gone to North Africa and South America.  In 1917 Maurice Collins took over 25,000 acres near Burra and bought from NSW a stud ram Prince Charlie for 3,000 guineas.  He paid 2,255 guineas for 60 highly bred ewes.  In two years he spent £16,755 largely on overdraft.  But it is Henry Collins who has been most notable and it is no mean feat to breed stud sheep and the stud breeder must indeed be a specialist and exercise extreme care.  Henry Collins came to SA from Devonshire.

When Mr Collins* paid £6-10-0 for land near his father’s station in 1912 to put large areas under lucerne, people said he was mad.  Now the land sells for £40-£60 per acre under lucerne.

[* Which Mr Collins is not clear from the context: perhaps Maurice?]
