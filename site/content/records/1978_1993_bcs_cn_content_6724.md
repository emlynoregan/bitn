Burra’s 105th Show.  [As usual this is a mistake: actually the 90th Burra Show.]

This was a success despite the cold weather with gate takings of $2,280.  Mr James Hawker opened the show.  There were record entries in Juvenile Needlework and Photography and higher than average in sheep and produce.  School displays, flowers and floral art were other highlights.
