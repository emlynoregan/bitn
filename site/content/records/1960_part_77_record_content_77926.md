Polo

After an absence of 37 years the Clare Polo Club returned to their old ground, with Stanley Hawker officially opening it before a large crowd on 25 January.  Since being reformed in 1971 practices and tournaments had been held at Anama Park and then at Anama.  Now the field within the racecourse has been levelled and drained and sown and should be an ideal playing surface.  Practices are held every Saturday afternoon with a season from January to Easter.
