Court Cases.  Thomas Richardson [of the Burra Hotel] claimed £9-6-6 from P-C Johnson for billiards and a small quantity of refreshments.  Johnson claimed this was payback for getting Richardson’s father fined for selling liquor in smaller quantity than allowed by his storekeeper’s licence.  The Bench noted that in any case the motive would be irrelevant and the verdict was given for the amount claimed.

Mrs Everett claimed support from her father John Calloway of the Pig and Whistle Hotel as she had a child to support and her husband had deserted her four months since.  An order was made for 5/- a week.
