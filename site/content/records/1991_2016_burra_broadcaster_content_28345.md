Doug Wiltshire writes expressing dissatisfaction with a not very helpful report from the Working Party on the Visitor Centre and also with the apparent inability of the National Trust to say whether the operation was now running satisfactorily or not – though they had lost $70,000 in five years.  They could not supply profit and loss accounts for the last year or indeed for the previous five year period.

Neither did the new association (BRTBA) present any business plan or financial documentation to inspire confidence.

Other questions showed that the initial operation was very successful and only required $7,000 from Council each year and won several awards.

Also, why would an operator of the Centre elect to maintain all the properties and assets involved in the tourist trail?  Surely this is the responsibility of the Council, which has an obligation to seek funding from State and Federal sources to assist.  Why should local ratepayers preserve heritage assets on behalf of all Australian citizens?

To anyone with any financial expertise, commonsense or business savvy, ‘the whole forum was as bad as one could possibly imagine’.
