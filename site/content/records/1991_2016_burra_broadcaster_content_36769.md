Letter.  Bill Stockman, President and Trevor Willis, Head Trainer on behalf of BBH Football Club Committee respond to an article in the Sunday Mail of 5 June that claimed the taking of ‘No Doz’ tablets was rife in the BBH Senior Colts team.  The letter makes the points:

The comment that empty tablet packets were strewn about the clubrooms is not only malicious, but also not correct.  Trevor Willis and Chris Taylor sweep out the rooms after every home match and have seen no evidence of that.

It is upsetting that such accusations would be taken to the media before the club had any chance to research them.

The club has no doubt that there may be isolated use of these particular tablets, which incidentally are not illegal in any club.

Media articles such as this only raise the awareness of such so-called performance enhancing tablets.

SANFL is investigating and will make a statement in due course.
