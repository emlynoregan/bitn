Burra Town Council.

The Burra Burra Copper Co. writes claiming rent for the Council Rubbish Dump as it is not on the property recently purchased by A.J. McBride, but on that purchased by Mr Kellock.

[This does not make clear why then the rent goes to the company.]

The Railway Commissioner has decided that the traffic does not justify a waiting room.

Cr Radford moved that Gully’s Wharf [Ford] be attended to and done thoroughly.  He was glad the Mayor and Cr Dane got stuck in it, but would have preferred it to have been Cr McWaters, who had opposed the work.  (Laughter.)  Carried.

Cr Radford moved that the Deputy Postmaster General be asked to buy the late residence of Mr Rabbich for use as a Post Office.  Carried.

The Mayor thought the council employees should get an extra 1/- on account of the high cost of living.

Cr Killicoat said another aspect was that they could lose their employees to shearing, which needed men, or to the quarry, which could absorb 40-50 and their replacements might cost 12/6 a day instead of 9/-.

Cr Radford cautioned that it would add £45 a year to costs to increase wages.

Cr Lane and Cr McWaters moved that the wages for permanent hands be raised by 1/- a day.  Carried.
