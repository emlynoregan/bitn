The Court of Appeals

When the court opened Cr Sampson objected to the Councillor who had written a number of the appeals sitting as an adjudicator.  His Worship thought that where Cr Hardy had shown any interest in the appeals he should not be allowed to adjudicate upon them.

When the appeal of Messrs Elder, Smith & Co. was called Mr Winnall appeared for them with a letter authorising him to defend them and saying they had not received the direct notice required under section 233 of the Municipal Act 1890.  Cr Hardy then withdrew the appeals against the properties of SAMA, Elder, Smith & Co. and P.L. Killicoat, which he had asserted were assessed below full and fair value.

The full list of the appeals and the results of them is printed.
