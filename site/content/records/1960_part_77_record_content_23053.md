Cricket

[This report seems very confused.  It reports the first day of two-day matches.]

At Burra:

Spalding 247 v. Koonaburra

North Booborowie 46 & 0 for 34 v. Burra Footballers 1 for 101 declared

At Booborowie: Burra Footballers 139 v. Booborowie 2 for 30 [which appears inconsistent with the above.]

The introduction to the report also says Mt Bryan is playing South Booborowie at home and has scored 200, but then the report also says North Booborowie 217 v. Mt Bryan 0 for 44

Hallett 9 for 237 declared v. Spalding 1 for 19

Colts Cricket: Hallett 149 v. Spalding 69
