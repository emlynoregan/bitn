At a special meeting of the General Committee after outbreak of war it was decided to abandon all Show work for the present and to form the Burra Burra Show War Committee.  As a result there was nothing to report about the Show.  Members were asked to give their subscriptions towards the war fund.  The War Committee is now functioning in conjunction with the other Patriotic Societies in the District.  The Show collected £59-11-0 in subscriptions and gave £100 to the War Fund.  Our overdraft is now £400, but our assets run into thousands of pounds.

A large crowd made the trip to Sturt Vale last year and it went off very satisfactorily.  An invitation is extended for this year’s trip on 14 April when Mr Codrington will be present.

Mr Warnes then thanked all who had supported the War Committee and the Burra Burra Show Inc. in general.  Mr A.B. Riggs also commended the Show War Committee.
