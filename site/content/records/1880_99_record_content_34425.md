Obituary.  Dr Baker, who formerly practised in Kooringa, died in Brisbane last Thursday.  He arrived from England in 1883 and first practised at Terowie and then at Jamestown when Dr Cockburn entered Parliament.  He was later at Moonta.

[Details from Dr Brummitt contradict part of the Brisbane report and he also fails to mention any period at Burra.]
