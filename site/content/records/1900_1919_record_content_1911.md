Guy Fawkes Day.  The pyrotechnic displays this year were of unusual dimensions.  One woman was alarmed to see some man trying to break into her house and summoned aid, only to find some wags had positioned ‘Guy’ to trick her.  Several children received a leathering for staying out late and burning holes in their apparel.  A batch of merrymakers will also visit the courts soon.
