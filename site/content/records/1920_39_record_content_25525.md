Willalo Methodist Church foundation stone was laid on 31 December 1927.  The locals had held off on building, hoping to place the church at the terminus of the railway to North Booborowie, but when hope faded there they bought a stone reserve nearly a mile south of Willalo Hall.  It was a bad day with wind and dust.  Revs Lee and Harris of Kadina and Redruth drove out to assist Rev. A. Dyer the resident minister.  Mrs G.J. Hanlin, President of the Ladies Committee, laid the stone.  £55 was placed on the stone and the annual fete was then held in Willalo Hall.  This raised a further £60 and considering the weather this was considered very satisfactory.  The contractor Mr E.J. Affolter expects the church to be completed on time for dedication on 15 March and the opening service on 18 March.
