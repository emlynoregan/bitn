Editorial: Gold Diggings in NSW and Gold discovered in Victoria

[The article is mostly a selection of correspondence from various letters and reporters.]

Though some have had success at Bathurst, when it is stated that there are some 2,000 at the diggings, the number of successes have not been very numerous.

Many diggers have already moved on to other employment.

The weather is now very severe.

Mr Hargraves has been awarded £500 for his discovery of gold and has been appointed Commissioner of Crown Lands.

A letter from Bathurst:

There are more than 2,000 diggers.

Those in parties of c. 6 are doing best.

Saw a company find a piece 16 oz and saw many other pieces 1 to 8 oz.

On the other hand a company of 6 that had worked hard got only 17/6 worth of gold.

There is general dissatisfaction at having to get a 30/- licence.

From the Bathurst Free Press

One party of 4 (4 of them teetotallers) got £165 for 10 days’ work, in pieces from 3 oz down.

Fitzpatrick’s party won £184-10-0 for two weeks labour, or £40 per man.

McGregor’s party of 5 in 5 days did not clear expenses, but in the next 5 days earned £95.  Overall they earned about £1-6-0 per man per day.

[The article goes on with examples of good and bad luck.]

Rewards have been offered for the discovery of gold in the Maitland area.

There are reports of gold discoveries in the Burragorang Ranges.

While some diggers have picked up large pieces, not one person in 50 has fallen across anything larger than 1 oz.

The diggers are mostly housed very poorly in gunyahs, which offer little protection from the biting cold and none from the rain.

There are recent reports of 85 teams and over 200 men camped at Mary’s Lane en route for Ophir.
