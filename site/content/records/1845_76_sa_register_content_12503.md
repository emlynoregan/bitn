SA Mining from the Times of 17 May

English & Australian Copper Co.  The Manager advises, dated 14 & 18 March, that two furnaces are out and cannot be repaired until the fires of the other furnaces go out for stocktaking.  But he reports more copper will be made this year than in the past.  The present stock of fuel guarantees this barring some extraordinary accident.  Cartage has remained brisk for the past four weeks.  Shipments of ore had been about 1,000 tons and might reach 1,800 tons before the season closes.  About 500 tons of coal at the Gawler Station would be conveyed to the Works before the rains set in and possibly some of the 2,000 tons at the Port Adelaide wharf.  On 5 March there were some 1,000 tons at the Works.
