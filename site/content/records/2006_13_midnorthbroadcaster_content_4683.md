Phoenix Copper has raised enough capital to begin exploration in the Burra area.  The share offer which closed on 18 January raised $6.7 million to fund exploration over approximately 1,300 square kilometres around Mr Bryan, Burra, Mongolata and Spalding in the Mid North as well as Minlaton on Yorke Peninsula.  The current copper and gold prices are attractive for mining operations and Phoenix Copper considers its tenement holdings contain a number of promising targets.
