Entertainment.  The Mohawk Minstrels appeared for the first time at the Burra Institute last night and were enthusiastically received by a good audience.  Sentimental and comic songs were interspersed with jokes.  Step-dancing by Messrs O’Neill, Gault & Gordon was the highlight.  They appear again tonight in a different program, which will be followed by a ball.
