‘The Other Side’ writes re the burning of D. Williams’s haystack, pointing out:

Before the fire Mr Williams estimated it at 10-12 tons not the 20 cited.

The boy referred to in the report was accompanied by one of Mr Williams’s sons who suggested (after the other boy’s father had refused them matches) that they apply to his mother. (i.e. Mrs Williams)

Mrs Williams provided the matches on the impression the boys were fetching them for the father.

The boys first burnt some blackberry leaves and then some loose straw from which the fire escaped to the haystack, rather than setting fire to the haystack directly.
