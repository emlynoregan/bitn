The Mayor summed up.  He thought the evidence was clear that the fire started in the front part of Mr Allenâ€™s office; that it spread from there to the next building occupied by Walker and Sons.  There had been a deliberate attempt to complete the destruction the next day, but there was no evidence to say by whom.

The jury came to the same conclusion.
