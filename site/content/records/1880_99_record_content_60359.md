Redruth Court, 22 July.

Inspector J.R. Gray brought a case about a stray cow against E.W. Crewes.  The defendant denied he owned the cow in question.  The conflicting evidence is reported in c. 1Â¼ columns and the case was eventually dismissed without costs.

The case against John Martin Blackwell for stealing clothes from a sample room, as previously noted, is then reported at much more length in an article a bit more than 1 column in length.
