Jackie Hart, A/Director Yorke & Lower North Health Service, writes explaining that Burra’s X-ray machine has been temporarily relocated to Victor Harbor as a replacement for their broken machine of the same model.  Country Health SA does not think this will create a problem as it has not been used in Burra since February 2010.  Local GPs have been referring patients to Clare and Gawler or even Adelaide.  The machine will return to Burra when Victor Harbor’s new machine is installed and that is due in May 2012.
