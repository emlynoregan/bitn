Mr Gosling of Thames St died after a long illness.  He was born at Mitcham near Adelaide 13 September 1881, the son of the late Mr & Mrs W. Gosling.  The family was an early mover to Broken Hill in 1886.  After school Mr Gosling worked in the mines, but later left to be a butcher.  He later returned to the mines until his health failed.  In May 1906 he married Miss Elsie S. Dunstan, daughter of the late Mr & Mrs W. Dunstan of Broken Hill and late of Burra.  Six years ago the family moved to Sandy Creek for three years before coming to Kooringa.  Mr Gosling has been in poor health for 17 years as a result of an accident and ‘miners’ complaint’.
