In the scheme the kitchen is to be refurbished with a gas oven, mains water, a dishwasher and a room is to be fitted out for seminars.  Stage lighting and controls are to be brought up to date, the stage gets new curtains and the projector room is updated.  Access is to be made for those with disabilities with ramps and exterior lighting to the front of the building.  The committee has looked at promotion, marketing, event co-ordination and joint marketing with the Art Gallery.  The member for Grey Barry Wakelin said the Town Hall is a significant architectural landmark in a town of historical regional importance and the program will help to revitalise the town and attract a range of tourism activities.  It is aimed also to increase usage for such events as weddings, conferences and conventions.
