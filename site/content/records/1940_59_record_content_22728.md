The Salvation Army & Victory in the Pacific

Immediately after the broadcast on Wednesday morning Les Gregor sounded Reveille on his cornet, the Citadel doors were thrown open and the drum and flag placed outside.  The children took the Sunday School bells and disturbed the neighbourhood with their ringing.  When the Captain went to ride her bicycle, she found it decorated with flags and streamers.  After the Thanksgiving Service at the Town Hall the Band formed up and marched to the Hospital, where a service was held for the benefit of the patients.  At night an open air service was held, followed by another in the Citadel.  On Thursday the women held a Thanksgiving Service in the afternoon and invited their menfolk to join them with a cup of tea.  A special Victory Cake had been made and all enjoyed the sociability.   There was another march to the Hospital to play hymns to the patients and another open air service at night, this time followed by a social and supper in the Citadel Hall.

The SA Police Band of 28 members will take part in the Centenary Celebrations on 13 October.
