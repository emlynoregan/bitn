Vegetables were very good, but fruit was limited.

Flowers were superb, though less numerous than in some years.

Cooking excelled itself this year.

Arts and Industries needed more space.

School work reflected well on the teachers and students.

Note that the report includes a photograph of the show grounds, one of a horse in action and also of I.J. Warnes and L.H. Foote.
