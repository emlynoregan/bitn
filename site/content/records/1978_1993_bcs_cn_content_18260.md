Burra & District Darts Association

The Association has been losing teams and players and an investigation has come up with three reasons:

Difficulties in filling sides with six players.

Finishing times are too late for working members.

There was insufficient encouragement for new and less experienced players.

The committee has decided on three changes:

Teams will compete as four-a-side.

This change will result in earlier finishing.

There will be first and second division teams, so allowing better opportunities for new and inexperienced players.
