Water Levels in Booborowie Valley

E.C. Allen MP asked the Minister of Development and Mines to report on test bores in the Booborowie Valley, aimed at determining the rate of recharge and the capacity of the valley.  Hon. D.J. Hopgood said 53 observation bores were maintained.  Five stratigraphic bores were drilled in a line to determine the hydraulic properties of the aquifer.  Other geological investigations are reported and a comprehensive geological report will be available in a few months.
