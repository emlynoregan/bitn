Burra Town Council, 4 October

The Council agreed to donate £5 towards decorating the streets of Adelaide for the visit of the King and Queen in 1949 – after deciding the request from the Citizens Committee for £20 was beyond them.

The Highways and Local Government Department confirmed that the District Road Grant of £100 was correct.

Registrar General of Deeds notified the Council of the intention to bring all land under the ‘Real Property (Registration of Titles) Act 1945.

Burra Electric Supply Co. Ltd advised it had approval (No. 34247) for its new tariffs as from 1 August 1948.

The police will be asked to stop school children and others from riding bikes on footpaths and the swing bridge.
