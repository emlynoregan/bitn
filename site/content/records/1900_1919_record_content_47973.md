Burra Town Council.

Letter from Burra Burra Copper Co. asking whether the rubbish depot was on land owned by Mr McBride or that owned by Mr Kellock.  They are to be informed it was on land owned by Mr McBride.  [This seems a rather odd report since the last council report has a letter from the same company asserting it was on Mr Kellockâ€™s land and yet asking for the rent to go to them.]

Mr Winnall presented the amended lease for the Burra Creek.
