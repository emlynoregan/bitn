Burra SES held a mock rescue of a car accident as the culmination of two weekends of training at Deep Creek.  Nine members took part with three SES instructors from Laura and Divisional Officer Mr I. McDonough.  A gutted Toyota Crown was donated by Mr B. Preiss and Mr D. Woolley towed it to the area and dropped it in the creek.  A fake victim, Mr Giles Ackford of Adelaide was then placed in the wreckage.  The victim had to be blanket-lifted out through the broken windscreen and then placed into a ‘Stoke’s litter’ and lifted vertically up the concrete retaining wall of the creek.  The Laura instructors demonstrated how to use the ‘jaws of life’ to open the car’s roof.
