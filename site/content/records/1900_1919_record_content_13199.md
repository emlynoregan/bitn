Accident.  As Mr R. Austin and party were going around Cobb & Co.’s corner on the way home from Iron Mine Sports the bolt which holds the shafts dropped out and the horse began to plunge away.  Luckily Mr Austin was able to quickly pull it up – a less fortunate result could have been anticipated had the accident occurred a little earlier on Flagstaff.
