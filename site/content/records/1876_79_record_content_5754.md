Crimes. Last Saturday night or Sunday morning it seems a boy was lowered down a chimney at Roach's Burra Mill and he then let in burglars. The safe however, resisted all attempts to open it.

On Monday morning it was discovered that Mr Colin’s office had been burgled and £4-£5 taken. Mr Coglin is offering £50 reward for information leading to a conviction.
