Burra Town Council, May meeting

The Badminton Club was granted the use of the Town Hall.

The Education Department was granted a 20 year lease on both lots in block 13A with the proviso that entrance be allowed to the slag paddock along the western fence.  [This is the area in front of the original school building including the pre-school area now.]
