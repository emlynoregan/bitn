Visit of the Minister of Education

As a result of the Ministerâ€™s visit to Burra schools in 1969 Mr E.C. Allen has been advised of the following results:

An attempt will be made to upgrade the Home Science Centre and orders have been prepared for new student work benches and a demonstration bench.

An additional gas cooker will be provided.

The old laundry facilities will be removed and a new washing machine and stainless steel trough will be installed.

A clothes dryer will be installed.

Present cookers will be relocated more conveniently.

A new ablution trough will be installed.

A full treatment for white ants will be undertaken.

Wire proofing to combat birds has been approved, but a contractor is hard to find.  Investigations of other ways to discourage birds will continue.
