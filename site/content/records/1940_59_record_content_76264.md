River Murray Floods.  Levels at Renmark are back to normal.  Lock 5 weir has been re-erected and the steamer Industry has gone to Lock 4 to re-install its weir.  At Cobdogla the level fell 2 ft last week, making a fall of 15 ft 9 inches since the peak on 2 September.  A fall of one foot on Monday left the river there 4 ft above normal.
