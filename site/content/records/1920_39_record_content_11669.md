Salvation Army.  The boys from Mt Barker arrived on Saturday.  There was a most successful demonstration at the Leighton Hall on Saturday evening and three services in the Salvation Army Hall on Sunday, though the weather kept audiences small.  Their show at the Institute on Monday drew a larger crowd.  Financial results are satisfactory.
