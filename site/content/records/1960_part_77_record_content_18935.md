Weather.  A severe storm struck Burra last Wednesday afternoon and deposited up to an inch of rain in fifteen minutes.  Most shopkeepers suffered some stock damage when gutters failed to cope with the flow, but little water entered tanks, as most was lost over the edge of gutters.  Some shops and homes lost roofing iron and many homes suffered damage to floor coverings when water entered houses.  The Burra Hospital had water through it and suffered minor damage, though much cleaning up was required.  Burra officially recorded 68 points in the storm and 94 points for the day.  Some properties recorded up to 150 points.

Lightning caused many fires.  Most were extinguished almost at once, but two or three acres were burnt in some places.  Across the town reported falls varied from 150 points on the west side to 50 on the east.

Trevor Richardson in his school bus loaded with children was in the midst of it when the storm broke along Johnson’s Creek with hail and flying tree branches.  At its peak the bus was being blown along in second gear with its engine off.  He had stopped to clear debris from the road.  Just after crossing a creek to join the old Adelaide Road a great wall of water came down it.  Princess Royal shearing shed lost its verandah, which was carried some 500-600 yards.

Photographs: two photos show Johnson’s Creek area before and after the storm.

In that area dozens of large gum trees were uprooted and smashed to pieces.  Others were stripped of every leaf, twig and branch, leaving only the main trunk.  The destruction was in a strip along the creek for a mile with another line of it running over the hills towards the homestead and another leading west.

[This would seem to be describing a tornado.]
