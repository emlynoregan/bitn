Burra Town Oval Project

At a public meeting in Burra Town Hall on 25 March it was decided after lengthy discussion to endeavour to raise £1,500 for the purpose of erecting suitable toilet facilities and turfing the Memorial Oval.  A public appeal has been launched.  Mr Baulderstone in addressing the meeting outlined the work of the War Memorial Committee over the years.  The appeal so far has £25.
