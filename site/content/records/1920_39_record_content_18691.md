Maurice Collins writes re the Market Square guns in reply to E.W. Crewes.  He takes a couple of paragraphs to say he is not going to take up the question of loyalty and then goes on to accuse Crewes of using deliberately misleading statements in suggesting the guns would be ‘in the creek’ if placed opposite the Institute.  As for the original plan, he wonders why, given that Mr Crewes was in office for several years after the war, he did not get busy and see the plan completed.  [He concedes that all recognised the fact that Crewes did wonderful work during the war period.]

Who is to blame that the Roll of Honour is still incomplete?  Who is to blame that the £70 contributed has been so placed that it accrued no interest?  Who are the three residents in whom custody of the guns is vested? Who is responsible for not carrying out our side of the bargain when Mr Hughes offered the second gun to complete the surroundings of the monument?  In the vast majority of towns guns are not placed at the monument, but in public parks and gardens.  In a few cases they are at the monument, which is then surrounded by a guard of some description.  Regardless of the guns being vested in three citizens, they are on Council ground.  If there is a great majority in favour of leaving them then the Council will again consider the matter very seriously.
