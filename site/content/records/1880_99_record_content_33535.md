Burra Town Council, 3 Sep.

Waterworks Dept. asked for payment of the half-yearly rent on the Burra Waterworks of £212-13-0.  Payment approved.

Before a road can be opened near the Smelting Works a survey will be needed.  Cr. Hardy moved the matter be delayed six months due to a shortage of funds.  Carried.

Cr Sampson moved the removal of the standpipe and meter in Market Square and that they get credit for the same from the Waterworks Dept.

Cr Hardy moved as an amendment that it be left until a report on it was received from the Waterworks Committee.  Not 2nd.

Cr Watt moved as an amendment that it stand over until the Waterworks Dept. advise the price, should it be done.  Carried.

Cr Hardy moved a turnstile be erected at one of the gateways to the Recreation Ground, which was presently kept locked.  Many would prefer to walk there on a Sunday than to go to the cemetery.  The turnstile would admit people, but keep out horses and cattle.  Cr Watt 2nd.

Cr Sampson moved as an amendment that the gates be locked and the Town Clerk hold the keys because the Park Lands account could not afford the cost.  After lengthy discussion, especially from Cr Hardy, the original motion was carried.

Mr Geake’s offer to light the Market Square lamp for 3 months for 15/- was accepted.

Trifle!  Somewhat cryptic remarks in the ‘Sparks’ column, extending for several weeks suggest that there was a debate in the town over whether members of the Rechabite Lodge [i.e. Teetotallers] could legitimately consume a trifle for dessert at a dinner.

‘Sparks’  ‘That skating king jewed the printer.’

[This presumably suggests that Mr H. Cowan left town without paying his advertising bill with the newspaper.]
