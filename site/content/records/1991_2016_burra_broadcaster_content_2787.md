The Commercial Hotel has undergone recent renovations.  The intention was to establish a beer garden next to the hotel in Commercial Street.  When the façade next to the hotel was removed it revealed some of the best stonework in Burra in a cottage set back from the street.  The cottage has one wall in common with the hotel and is thus thought to have been built at the same time.  The Commercial Hotel was opened on Wednesday 6 September 1876 ‘but no great stir was made on that occasion’ according to the Northern Mail at the time.

In 1893 Daisy Kennedy, reputedly the greatest violinist of her day, was born in the hotel.  She made a return visit with her brother in 1964 to have a last look, as she said, at the hotel where she was born and at the house in Kangaroo Street (now occupied by Mr & Mrs M.W. Eberhard) where she lived while her father was headmaster of the Burra School 1892-95.  Her brother A.L. Kennedy, who accompanied her to Burra, achieved fame also; as one of Mawson’s companions on his Antarctic journeys.  He later surveyed a vast area of the Kimberley, becoming one of Australia’s leading geologists and mineralogists.  Present owners of the Commercial have now presented their hotel frontage as a Burra showpiece, featuring the beer garden with the quaint cottage backdrop.
