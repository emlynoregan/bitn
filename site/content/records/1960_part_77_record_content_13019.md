During the party Mr Jennison hoped Mrs Draysey would enjoy her brief return to Burra and a variety of other people spoke.  Former Headmaster Mr Biddle said that 46 years ago there had been one teacher and one room, making it difficult to keep all classes going smoothly.  Transport difficulties made it hard to increase roll numbers, though a few like Cliff Flower and Fred Schultz came in on horseback.  Others who spoke included Barbara Hogan (Head Prefect), Hedley Pearce, Murray Scriven and Mr A. Bartholomaeus, who was number 1on the High School roll.  Mrs M. Kellock moved a vote of thanks on behalf of the Parents & Friends Association.  The Burra Town Hall was filled to capacity on Thursday night for the concert [for which items are listed.]
