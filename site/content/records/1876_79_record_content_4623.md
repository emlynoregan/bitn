Rabbits. Another meeting was held at Mongolata re the rabbit question. The meeting called for the inclusion of a compulsory clause in any legislation. 
A similar meeting with the same feelings was held at Mr Midwinter’s house at Baldina. 
A report from the Register says a large deputation waited on the Minister of Crown Lands on Tues. 20 Aug. re the rabbit question. The report covers about 2¼ columns.
