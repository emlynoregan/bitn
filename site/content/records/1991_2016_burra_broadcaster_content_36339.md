Mt Bryan Uniting Church closed on 3 April following a service attended by more than 80 people.  Many former residents returned for the occasion.  The service was taken by Burra’s Uniting Church minister, Frank Tuppin and Presbytery [sic] Minister John Cranmer.  The church opened in 1937 as the Mt Bryan Methodist Church – since 1977 The Uniting Church of Australia.  [3 photos.]
