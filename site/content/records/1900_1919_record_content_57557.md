Burra Town Council

H. Lord offered to light the rotunda each night for a year till 11.30 with a 60 watt lamp, controlled from the hotel, if Council would pay Â£4 plus 50/- to 60/- for installation costs.  Offer accepted.

A deputation will wait on the Commissioner of Public Works seeking enlarged water mains in the town.  Cr Radford said almost continuous pumping scarcely kept the bottom of the tank wet.
