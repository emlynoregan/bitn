The Burra Show will be held on 12 October.  This was decided at a meeting in the Eastern Telephone Building on 12 October 1946.  The society has not held a show since 1939, but the enthusiasm shown at the meeting suggests the 1946 show will be one of the best.  Elected: President, A.B. Riggs; Vice-Presidents, R. Humphrys & F.H. Reed.  [Committee members are then listed.]

Mr M.T. Fuller read the balance sheet, which showed the Society had liabilities of about £644 and assets of c. £5,000.  The Show War Committee had donated £112 to patriotic bodies in the last twelve months and all its funds had now been expended so that the committee has now completed its work.
