Adelaide Wool Sales.  Local district prices were topped by R.M. Gebhardt & Co. of ‘Mokota’ at 128c per kilo.  [Other local district prices are printed.]

Football.  At the beginning of the season S. Schrapel, who had been playing for South Clare, was appointed playing coach for North Clare.  South Clare did not grant clearance.  The North Eastern League did not vote in favour of such a clearance and SANFL ruled a clearance was necessary.  At a meeting of the NEFL on Tuesday night North Clare gave notice of its intention to withdraw from the League.
