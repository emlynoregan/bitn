Burra & District War Memorial Committee

About half the target of levelling the oval, grassing the area and erecting a boundary fence and grandstand, has been met.

An enlarged area of oval has been re-surveyed and levelled and a banked bicycle track formed.

The old dressing rooms, which intruded on the enlarged area, have been partly demolished and made usable after remodelling.

The ground was seeded, but the year was too dry for germination last spring.  The clover germinated in the recent winter rains and the couch should come on in spring.

The main bottlenecks in the progress have been lack of finance and the shortage of materials.  The latter has gradually been overcome and the committee is ready to install a watering system and a boundary fence before erecting a grandstand if finance for that can be found.

A donation list was opened, but the response has been disappointing and an appeal for funds is now renewed.
