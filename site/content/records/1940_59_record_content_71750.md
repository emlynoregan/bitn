Shearers’ Award.  The old awards included a prosperity loading to be a fluctuating amount according to the wool market.  In 1948 and twice in 1950 upwards adjustments were made, but since prices began to fall in 1952-53 from 85½d to 60d average at present, no comparable fall has occurred in the shearers’ award.  A new award has now been made using a different formula (which is printed), which reduces the payment to shearers from £7-6-0 to £6-18-6 per 100 sheep.  If the old formula had been used the award would have fallen to £6-3-0 per 100.
