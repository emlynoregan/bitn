SA Geology

[The following is a very small extract from a lengthy report: Geological Notes of a Journey in South Australia from Cape Jervis to Mount Serle by A.R.C. Selwyn, Government Geologist, Victoria.]

30May.  Crossed the Camel’s Hump Range.  Country quite destitute of timber.  Fine agricultural country with rocky ridges.  In the vicinity of Burra the beds are much destitute and twisted and consist of hard grey and white cherty, siliceous rocks, crystalline, white and grey limestone, blue grey and brown arenaceous slaty beds and hard fine-grained grey flagstones, the latter apparently underlying the cherty calcareous and aluminous beds in which the Burra lodes are worked.

I was not able to examine the celebrated Mine, as, on requesting to be allowed to do so, I was told by the Captain that unless I had a written order from the Directors, he could not allow me to enter the Mine.

[The report then goes on with geological details of the trip:

Tuesday 31 May: Burra to Mt Bryan & Wandillah Creek.]
