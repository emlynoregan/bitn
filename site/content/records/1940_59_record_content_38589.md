Burra Town Council.  The Council realises that the town’s back streets are not in very good condition.  It has no road-making equipment and it has been drawn to their attention that there is a Government scheme that allows them to borrow money at interest free rates to purchase such machinery.  The debt can be repaid over ten to fifteen years.  Councillors will inspect road-making machinery on display at the Royal Show.

The Finance Committee recommended that the Council borrow £1,200 – one third under the Government subsidy scheme and two thirds from the Savings Bank, by permission of the Government at a rate of 3⅝%.

The Mayor said he did not approve this idea.  The Finance Committee thought that the Council could hand £400 of the amount borrowed to the War Memorial Committee and use the remaining £800 to invest against its overdraft.  This was incorrect and the Council would be duty bound to hand all the £1,200 to the War Memorial Committee.  It was resolved not to adopt the Finance Committee’s recommendation.

Cr Baulderstone moved that the Council borrow £800 for the scheme; £400 under Government subsidy and £400 at interest.  The latter would have to be repaid within ten years.  The £400 already in hand could remain where it was for the time.  It was earning interest.  This was carried.
