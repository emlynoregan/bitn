Mrs J. Voumard of Largs, a former resident more than 20 years ago, visited Burra and lists the improvements she noticed:

The wonderful swimming pool

The almost completed post office

Improvements to a number of shops

Improvements at the bowling green

More bituminised streets

Improvements to the oval, lawn tennis courts and the new rifle range

The Town Hall supper room and kitchen

More trees and some lovely gardens

BUT she also noted the ‘dirty, untidy, and “hard to walk on” footpaths and weed infested watertables’ which spoil the solid impression.
