Burra Show Society, General Committee Meeting 27 March.

The Burra Sports Association has increased its charge for use of the racecourse for the dog trials from £1-1-0 to £3-3-0.  As the trials made a loss the President considered the showground as good a place to hold them and it could also accommodate the polo and melon races held in conjunction with the trials.  Mr A. Riggs agreed and so moved.  Mr Dew seconded, saying it would eliminate only one race: the Mile Flutter.

Mr Pickering, Chairman of the Finance Committee, thought a larger crowd due to a better program could be drawn to the racecourse and he moved an amendment accordingly.  Seconded by Mr Saunders.  Mr Bednall thought the matter might be discussed with the Sports Association with a view to a lower charge.  The amendment was carried.

The secretary threatened to resign over committeemen allowing sheep to graze the grounds without his permission and ordering expenditure without his knowledge.  A vote of complete confidence in the secretary and an agreement not to infringe again saw him agree to continue.
