A Woodcarters’ Meeting was held on Saturday 12 May to petition the Government to repeal the obnoxious clauses of the mew timber-licence regulations.

Mr A. Motley was elected to the chair.  He said the imposition of a £5 licence for woodcarters would drive many off the road.  Consumers would certainly feel the impact.

Mr Nankervis moved that the imposition of a £5 licence was tantamount to a stoppage of their trade.  Carried.

The chairman then commented on other oppressive clauses of the Act: special permission to cut wood on any particular portion of Crown Lands and the restriction of cutters to a specified locality.  They needed various localities to suit the wood to customers’ needs.

Mr Fitzgerald moved that these restrictions were oppressive.

A discussion followed involving Mr James, Mr Dale MP, & Mr Tigganz.

Mr Stapleton James proposed the organising of a memorial to the Government.  Carried.

The chairman read the draft of a memorial and Mr J. Bull proposed its adoption, seconded by Mr Briar and carried.  [The text of the memorial is printed.]

Mr S. James proposed and Mr Evans seconded that a 1/- subscription be established to defray costs.  Carried.

Other motions were passed enabling the above to be implemented.
