Burra Conservation Study

This week extracts from Part II, Sections 3 & 4: Walls and Fences.

Part of the charm of the town rests with the extensive use of stone walls and simple fencing.

Other than stone the open picket fence, ornamental mesh, galvanised iron and hedges are all common.  In more recent times cream brick and coloured concrete blocks have been more prevalent and if this were to continue would help to remove an important component of the Burra townscape.  Stone walls should be retained and constructed where possible.

Preferred forms are stone, wood picket and paling (painted white), split timber, decorative screen mesh, iron pickets, galvanised corrugated iron.
