Accident.  A woman passenger was critically injured when a car she was travelling in rolled over about one mile south of Burra on Saturday morning c. 7.50 a.m.  The driver, George Brian Puckett, an electrical mechanic of Kilburn, sustained lacerations and shock.  Rita McEllister of Salisbury was thrown out and sustained a compound fracture of the right leg, serious lacerations to the right ear, chest injuries and probable concussion.  Mr Bill Nankivell took her to Burra Hospital and she was later transferred to the RAH where she remains in a critical condition.
