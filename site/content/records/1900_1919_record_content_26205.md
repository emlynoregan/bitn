Daniel Horan, an old age pensioner, was apparently unlawfully on the premises of the Burra Hotel on 25 December and was asked to show reason why his pension should not be suspended.  He did not appear and neither did the ‘person who made the report’.  The magistrate decided to take more time to consider the matter.
