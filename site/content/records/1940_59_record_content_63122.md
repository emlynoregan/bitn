Burra Burra DC has a huge job in keeping about 800 miles of district roads in order and it will be made easier by the approval recently granted for the purchase of a very heavy grader.  A sum of £10,000 has been spent on district roads during the financial year.  Forty miles of road have been formed in the Booborowie area.  The Council has applied for a grant of £21,800 for 1954-55 to enable the upgrading of Main Road 45 between Burra and Black Springs, with second priority to the Lochiel-Burra Road and the main streets in Hanson & Farrell Flat to be bituminised.  The cost of roads is very high.  Work to bituminise the Mt Bryan main street cost £3,000, of which £1,100 was for the bitumen alone.  The DC will sell some town allotments on which rates have been unpaid since 1940.
