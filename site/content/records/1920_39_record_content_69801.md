Local Government subsidy of £91 has been paid into the Council’s account.

Three trees near the bowling green will be inspected before a decision to remove them is made.

New Streetlights are to be installed:

East street intersection.  [Which end is not stated.]

On the traffic sign.  [Market Square presumably]

Corner of Linkson & West Sts.

Near Aberdeen Lodge Hall.

Corner of Pleasant Row and Paxton Tce.

It was resolved to remove the railing around the rotunda and the shrubs.
