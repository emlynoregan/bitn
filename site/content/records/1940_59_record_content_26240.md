Burra CWA arranged for the members of Clare Red Cross Aids to come to Burra on Wednesday 1 May to produce Marjarah, an ‘Eastern Romance’ in which Miss Mavis Williams as a Moon Princess introduced her Concert Troup, which then presented a show that drew on material from various Eastern Operettas.  £56 was raised for the Burra Hospital.
