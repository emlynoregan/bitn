Obituary.  William Norrell James died Thursday 23 February.  He was born at Princes Town.  This little place then lay between Kooringa and Mr F. Dew’s old homestead, near Springbank.  The late Mr James was born in 1856, the son of the late Mr & Mrs Richard Poole James, early pioneers.  After schooling he helped his father and then before marrying took up farming.  He married Miss Emma Rebecca Richardson Whetstone, daughter of Mr & Mrs John Whetstone of Luton near Clare on 8 April 1878 at St Michael’s Church Bungaree near Clare.  At that time he was helping his father farm at Armagh.  Later he was employed for over 20 years by Mr Angus on Baldina Station.  (‘Black Hills’ was then the name of Mr Barker’s station now known as Baldina.)  He retired to Victoria St Aberdeen, originally the home of one of the officers of the Burra mine and directly opposite the home of the late J.D. Cave, first Town Clerk of Burra.*  His widow and six of eight children survive: Richard Poole James (Booborowie), Norrell James (Mutooroo), W. Les. James (Kooringa), H.O. Bert James (Adelaide), Melvin C. James (Adelaide) & Mrs Paul Baynes (Pandama NSW).  There are 11 grandchildren and 6 great-grandchildren.  [William Norrell James born 14 May 1858 Ardmore (Burra): died 23 February 1939 Kooringa, residence Aberdeen.  ‘Ardmore’ is perhaps an incorrect transcription of Ashmore: a small subdivision further west than Princess Town and near Copperhouse.  * He lived at Victoria Place not Victoria St and J.D. Cave was the fifth Town Clerk from October 1884 to January 1889.  The Council Assessments suggest that the name Victoria Place was given to Mr James’ house as above and to the two houses on the opposite side of the road; also known as Snake Gully.]
