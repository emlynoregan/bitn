Burra and the Coronation

A public meeting in the Town Hall on 9 March, presided over by W. Pattrick, drew a poor attendance.  It was to decide on how Burra would celebrate the coronation.  The discussion emphasised the children of the town and how to cater for them.  It was eventually resolved that there would be a Grand March with School Children, CWA, RSL, etc. and a sports day.  The route of the march is to be left in the hands of the committee and if possible a Coronation Ball will be held on Tuesday night.  A committee of ten with power to add was formed.  W. Carpenter is the Chairman and W. Pattrick the Vice Chair.  E.R. Davey was elected Secretary and J. Sorrell is Assistant Secretary.
