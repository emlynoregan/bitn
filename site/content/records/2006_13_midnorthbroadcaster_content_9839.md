Burra Visitor Centre has a new manager.  After three years as manager Anita Stokes is moving to Goolwa.  Her replacement is Alan Kendal who comes from Peterborough and has experience in management and leadership roles, including school principal, army chaplaincy, communications consultant and correspondent for the Mid North Broadcaster.  He hopes to help to make Burra a destination, not just somewhere people go through on their way elsewhere.
