‘A Guarantor’ writes asking for more extended accounts of Council meetings.  The discussion with regards to the trees was too mean and ridiculous to require further comment.

Many residents have guaranteed certain sums per year for water and may be required to pay for more water than they use up to the limit of the guarantee, but if you live near the Aberdeen water trough you can have what you want for nothing.  The free troughs, if continued in Aberdeen as at present, will enormously reduce the likelihood of the cost of water being reduced.  The Kooringa well had to be paid for and Aberdeen people can likewise pay for their water.

A ‘Ratepayer’ also writes re the meanness of the Councillors over the question of trees.  The Council by such an excess of economy makes itself a laughing stock.

‘Non Nobis Solum’ writes considering the Council is full of ‘party humbug’.  He is sorry that the present Mayor has had to put up with ‘such a lot of old dames’.  They refuse a few pounds for trees, but these are the same men who voted the inspector an extra £10 a year for doing what he was engaged to do and also added on a few pounds for his getting signatures to memorials in the hours he is already paid for and a few pounds to collect rates and a few pounds to impound goats.  His salary almost becomes double what the Council led ratepayers to believe the Inspectorship would be done for.  They also go spending money to fence the Aberdeen Reserve, which they don’t own.  [He also lists other ‘follies’.]  It is time things were done in the town to best advantage and voted for without fear or favour.
