Burra High School students celebrated the end of the school year with a banquet as usual.  They were treated to the traditional feast by members of the Parents & Friends Association.

Speech night was held on Wednesday in the large assembly room.

Mr Easson read his report.

1942 opened with 62 students and grew to 65 with an average daily attendance of 53.6.  Absenteeism was higher than usual due to the prevalence of measles and other illnesses throughout the year.  The staff had been one fewer than last year.

The sports days had been very successful.

The school’s war effort had been very creditable with over £70 sent to the SPF.

Members of the War Savings Group have invested more than £150 in War Savings Certificates.

At least seventy old scholars are in the fighting forces: 4 in Women’s Services, 4 in the RAN, 40 in the AIF and 22 in RAAF.

He spoke in appreciation of the High School Council and the Parents & Friends’ Association and their leadership.  He thanked the Burra Record for regularly reporting the school’s activities and the Town Council for the use of Victoria Park for sports.

He regretted the move to Gawler of Miss Koehne and announced the loss also of Junior Teacher Mr Hickenbotham, who has had his notice to go to the Training College.

He noted the change of the Intermediate to a three year course to give a broader and more satisfactory education.  Travel allowances for those travelling more than eight miles have been increased and the number of exhibitions, bursaries and scholarships had been increased.

In the November 1941 University Examinations the school did well with 61 subject passes out of 88.

6 Intermediate Certificates were obtained and 1 Leaving Certificate.

In 1942 fourteen students sat for the Intermediate Certificate with results to be announced in January next.

Dr Steele then gave a speech in which he discussed the changing nature of education, the impact of the war and looked forward to post war times.  He then presented certificates and prizes.

Intermediate Certificates earned in 1941 were presented to:

Joyce Hopkins	Connie Byles	Betty Parks

Lois Riggs	James Terry	Ronald Fuller

A Leaving Certificate was presented to Rhonda Smith.

Other prizes and awards are listed and the entertainment program is described.
