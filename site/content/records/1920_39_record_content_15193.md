Burra Town Council, 16 February

Burra Hospital complains of howling dogs in the neighbourhood.

The owner will be asked to control them.

A quarry is to be opened for the Council on the School Hill.

The road from the post office to the station gate is to be repaired.  [Probably not till the winter though.]

Various other matters relating to roads and footpaths and raising metal were discussed.
