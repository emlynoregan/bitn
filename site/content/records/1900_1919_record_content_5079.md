Weather.  A violent storm burst over Burra on 14 January.  There was high wind with blown dust which removed roofs from a number of outhouses and flattened fences.

The Bushman’s Home lost its roof which landed many yards away.  ‘Mrs Allen having a marvellous escape from death.’  [Mrs Alfred Allen (Mary): my great-grandmother.]

Much damage was done to the east of the town where bushes used as stock feed were covered with dust and grass paddocks reduced to dustbins.  Trees were uprooted and wagons etc. overturned.  Fire broke out at the Waterworks yard, but it was fortunately extinguished before it had much hold as Mrs Anderson, who lives nearby, noticed it early.  It burnt through the wood under a galvanized fence and just reached the grass.  The firewood for the boiler was saved.
