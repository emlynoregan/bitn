Football (by ‘Quiz’).  The best game yet of the season was played last Saturday at the Recreation Ground, between the Blues and Whites (or non-colours) with a majority of about 8 Whites over Blues.  Blues 2.6 defeated Whites 1.1.  There was much added by the presence of a good umpire in Mr W. Hele.

‘The bad language used on the ground on Saturday was something frightful.’
