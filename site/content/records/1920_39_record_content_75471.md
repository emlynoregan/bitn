Obituary.  Annie Bown who died rather suddenly at home on 20 June was well known at World’s End and Burra.  She was the second surviving daughter of the late John & Martha Bown of World’s End and was born in September 1867 and her parents were some of the earliest pioneers of Burra, first residing at Springbank and later at World’s End where Mr Bown took up land which he held until he died.  Miss Bown came to Aberdeen about 13 years ago.  Death was caused by heart trouble.  She leaves three sisters and one brother: W.J. Bown (Redruth), Mrs B. James (Prospect), Mrs F. Honeychurch (Anlaby) & Mrs Ada Giles (Angaston).  [Not traceable on Births CD: death registered as 20 June 1939 Aberdeen.]
