General Aid Society.  At the July meeting it was decided to finalise the business of the society, as they were unable to carry on under present circumstances.  The chair presented to them by the Royal Institution for the Blind will be given to the RSL and so will the tea urn.  The crockery will be left for the use of the church.  After paying 15/- for hall use the balance in hand of Â£3-10-0 will be sent to Angorichina Hostel.  Mrs J.B. Rowe, President.  [The chair was actually presented to Miss Bubb who gave it to the society when she went to live in Sydney.  See 51, 27, 9 July 1930, page 3.]
