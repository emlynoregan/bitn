Obituary.  Porter Elliott of Terowie was run over by a train shunting at Terowie.

[John Elliott died 27 June 1906 at Terowie aged 48.]

He had written to his daughter who was attending school in Burra, saying that she could stay in Burra much longer than originally intended.  Within an hour of receiving his letter a telegram arrived calling her to Terowie because her father had been killed.
