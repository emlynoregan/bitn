The church grounds have recently been renovated and the toilets rebuilt.

A luncheon followed.

A hand-woven scarf made by Mr Jack Clemson in Burra Hospital was presented to Bishop Redding.  Special thanks were expressed to Dr J.V. Peters who came to play the organ and to the choir of Hillcrest and their choirmaster John Symons and to Mr & Mrs Frank Reed for hosting the choir.  In all over 70 people had contributed to making the day a success and a remarkable occasion in St Mary’s history.
