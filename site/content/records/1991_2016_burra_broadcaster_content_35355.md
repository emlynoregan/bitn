A Touchdown Television Crew based in New Zealand has been in Burra for four weeks to film ‘Miss Popularity 2005’.  On Friday night the winner was voted for by a 650 strong crowd at Morphett’s Enginehouse.  A local recipient of half the prize money was also selected.  Miss Popularity winner, Jesse welcomed local identity Di Day to the stage to receive $50,000.

Last Wednesday night the weather forced voting indoors to the Town Hall, which was filled to overflowing.  Storms and torrential rain continued throughout the district.  On Thursday the girls were taken into Basin Farm for a shoot with the storm as background.  The 50-strong crew was accommodated locally for the month, catered for by the Golf Club and transported around by numerous individuals.

Contestants were hosted by local families.  Apart from prizes won by individuals, local charities and community bodies were often recipients of fundraisers instigated by the production team.  The crew had received favourable reports from their scouts that the town could provide what they needed for the show.  [4 colour photos.]
