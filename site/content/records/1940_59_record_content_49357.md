Burra Rifle Club.  Saturday was a good day, with high scores over the 800 yard range.  An all-time record shoot resulted with best results from two of the oldest members.  Tom Heinrich scored 18 successive bulls.  He and Jim Schwier both scored possibles in the first round and Tom dropped only one point in the second round to score 99 off the rifle.  Jim finished with 95 off the rifle.  Jim Brown shot a 94, as did G. Webster and R. Bernhardt [all off the rifle.]
