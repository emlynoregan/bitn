Burra High School.  Water pressure at the school has been the subject of a complaint.  Mr E.C. Allen made enquiries and E & WS Inspectors report that at the school boundary pressure was 74 lbs per square inch and the flow 95 gallons per minute.  At one point within the school the flow was only 54 gallons per minute and the pressure 40 lbs per square inch.  It is the state of the internal plumbing that is causing the problem.  This can be rectified on order from the Public Buildings Department.
