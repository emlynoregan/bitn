Burra Burra Show Inc.  Annual report of the President, W.H. Lloyd.

The last show was on 13 October.  Attendance was estimated at 3,000.  The show was opened by Hon. A.R. Downer.  Mr Rex Warnes opened the new Sheep Pavilion.  Entries were numerous and for ring events a record 350.  Sheep entries were disappointing owing chiefly to some doubt of the pavilion being ready in time.  The ring was improved in shape and the jumps adjusted for greater safety.  A new fence was erected on the southern boundary, from donated material and two new gates were hung.  Sideshows were well patronised.  School exhibits were appreciated and shade provided for dogs.  A Gala Night was held and was well attended.  The Sheep Dog Trials were well attended and keenly contested.  The President thanked all those who contributed in time, money or labour to the improvements and to the successful show.
