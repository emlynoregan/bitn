Local Developments

At BCS works are under way for the $380,000 swimming pool.

At Burra Hospital builders have begun additions to the Boarding Facility – formerly the Nurses’ Home.  DEET has allocated over $130,000 for the project.  When completed the Boarding Facility will have a dining area, another toilet and shower area, a recreation area and another bedroom.

At the Commercial Hotel the demolition of an old store room has brought to light a lovely old stone cottage, thought to be part of the original hotel building.  $20,000 is being spent on this restoration project.

Theft.  Some $400 worth of floorboards has been stolen from a disused house near Farrell Flat.
