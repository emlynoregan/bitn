Burra Soldiers’ Memorial Fund.

N. Hiles Pearse wrote to the Burra Council from ‘Corra Lin’ Florieton 2 June.

The family is grieving the death of his brother, Bert Pearse, and he writes suggesting Burra have a memorial to those of the Burra volunteers who fall in action.  Such a thing could be done inexpensively and we would be willing to give £5-5-0 or more if required.  ‘It is the least we can do for our brave lads who fall in a foreign country, away from their own kin, to be buried in unknown graves.’

Mr Crewes’ thoughts turned to the South African War Memorial in Adelaide, though not on so large a scale of course.

Cr Killicoat thought it a good idea.

A statue had been erected in Jamestown with respect to the South African War, though unfortunately the wording made it sound as if the lads had been killed by the people of Jamestown.
