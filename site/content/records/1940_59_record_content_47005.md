Burra Town Council

Dyers Weed is to be eradicated near the Bon Accord Hotel.

Advice has been received that the best way to eradicate onion weed is by flame-thrower.

Burra & District War Memorial Committee seeks to borrow from Council any pipe and fittings available and to be permitted to buy 1,000 ft of piping to replace that removed from Victoria Park some years ago.

Burra Electric Supply advise they erected the line on the right hand side of Paxton Terrace because the telephone line was on the left hand side.  Pine trees had to be cut and the Company undertook in future to approach the Council prior to such work.

The Electric Supply Co. Board will meet two members of Council on 25 August to discuss future supply of electricity at Burra.

H.W. Rees of Burra Talkies offered to renew the picture agreement on the same basis as before.

Mr A. Dane of the Burra Talkies said he had not finalised discussions with his partners.

The Town clerk was directed to write to Mr Rees advising that Council had at no time given Mr Dane to understand that the lease would be renewed.  Council will seek legal advice about any of their obligations in the matter.

E.A. Keal, architect, has forwarded plans for proposed alterations and additions to the Burra Hotel and for a new sewage disposal unit.

The electrical wiring at the Town Hall will be inspected.
