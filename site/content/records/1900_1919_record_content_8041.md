Burra Water Commission met at Burra Institute 22 June.

The Mayor presided with Crs Cook, Snell and Sangster.  Crs Lott, Lockyer & West were absent.

The Commissioner of Public Works sent a letter in which he agreed to a rebate of £81-10 owing to the extra costs due to repairs to the works.  The letter was received and a cheque for £81-1-0 sent to the Commissioner as half of a half-year’s rent from 1 January to 30 June 1903.

It was resolved that applications be called for a certified engineer at £11 a month for the Burra Waterworks.

It was pointed out that a number of meters needed repair.  The task of getting an extra man to help the engineer was left with the Mayor and Chairman of the Waterworks.

Dr Sangster moved that rent for the meters be charged from 1 July at 4/- p.a. for 1”, 3/6 p.a. for ¾” and 3/- p.a. for ½”, payable half-yearly in advance.

The Commissioner requested Council to sign the lease of the Waterworks and return it. Cr Snell moved this be further considered.

Cr Sangster moved that as the Water Commission still has under consideration the rearrangement of the present scheme and until this is finalised the Commission is unable to give a definite reply to the deputation which waited on them re the water concessions.

It was decided to put a meter on at Messrs Elder Smith & Co. at Aberdeen.
