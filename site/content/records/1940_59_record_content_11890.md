Captain Don Taylor, formerly of G. & R. Wills agency in Clare, writes from the Middle East with news of Rod Lieberknecht, who was formerly employed at Sara & Co.’s Burra North Store.  He comments that Rod’s officer had seriously considered recommending him for an award for bravery, but the incident had involved about four others and he could hardly recommend them all.  Captain Taylor said while he was briefly in hospital he met there a dental mechanic previously with C.L. Phillips of Burra.  [The editor suggests this might possibly refer to W. Ryan.]  He had also met Clem Davey of Burra.
