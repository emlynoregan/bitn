Burra RSL President Len Simpson calls for a good attendance at the War Memorial for the 90th anniversary of the armistice that ended WWI on 11 November.  Roger Cross has prepared a display in the rotunda of memorabilia and a list of the resting places for the fallen soldiers named on the memorial in Market Square.

The Mining heritage Working Group organised a two day visit to allow heritage officials to visit Burra and Moonta in the light of the push to get Burra & Moonta World Heritage Listing as part of the Transnational Cornwall & West Devon Mining Landscape Sites.  About 60 local residents heard the addresses at the Burra Town Hall from Professor Phillip Payton, Professor of Cornish and Australian Studies at the University of Exeter and Barry Gamble of the Cornwall County Council.

Professor Payton had his audience spellbound with his extensive knowledge of Cornish and Australian Mining and town history.  Mr Gamble dealt with the preparation of submissions of the Transnational World History Listing.  [Photo of Professor Payton.]
