Burra Cheer-up Soc.

The Ladies’ band etc. welcomed Pte R. Henderson on Wednesday last and on Friday Lieut. Ross Harris and Cpl ‘Ranji’ Shortridge.

Most of our boys are now home and one of the last functions of the society will be to distribute gold medals to them all.  These are being designed by Stevenson Bros. of Adelaide.
