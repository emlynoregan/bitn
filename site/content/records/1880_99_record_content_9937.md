Letter from ‘Fiat Institia Ruat Cœlum’ asking why the police are not investigating a case of attempted suicide in one of our leading hotels last week.  Is it being hushed up because the landlord is a man of means or because some of our leading men were present or because the Inspector has instructed the police to do nothing?
