Burra Picnic Races at Thistlebeds were revived on Saturday and drew a bumper crowd of more than 1,200.  There were horse races, gymkhana events, barrel racing and novelty events.  The races had been absent for 12 years, but were greeted with renewed enthusiasm in perfect weather.  In the evening revellers were entertained by local band ‘The Eastern Greys’ (Kerry & Brett Davy, Bruce Gundersen, Andrew Shepley, John Oates and Lynn Riggs) and with headline act ‘The Barking Ants’ kept the crowd entertained into the night.  Things look promising for a repeat in 2016.  [4 photos.]
