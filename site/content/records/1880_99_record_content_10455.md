Mt Bryan.  A deputation from Mt Bryan waited on the Commissioner of Public Works, asking for a goods shed, and on the Minister of Education asking for a school and teacherâ€™s residence.  It was pointed out that the school was presently conducted in the Wesleyan Chapel, which lacked a fireplace and was very draughty.  The minister said 20 children within a radius of two miles were needed.
