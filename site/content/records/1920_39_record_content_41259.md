Mongolata Goldfield

Mongolata No. 8 continues to yield well: the latest crushing yielded 26oz 5dwt 5gr from 4 tons 7cwt of ore.

Byles’ Mongolata Goldmining Co. No. 1 recently crushed 5 tons 15cwt and the yield was 6oz 2dwt per ton.

W.J. Richards will be in Burra today and tomorrow to explain to investors the prospectus and prospects.  There will be a meeting on Thursday at 3 o’clock in the Eastern Telephone Building for all interested.

The Rampton Syndicate’s last crushing of 5 tons 9 cwt yielded 8½oz per ton without the tailings, which is a field record.

W.H. Morgan responds to Mr Parsons saying Parsons resorted to cheap sarcasm and made unfair comparisons.  Block 13341 was not the block pegged by Parsons.
