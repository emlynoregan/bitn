‘Cousin Jack’s’ in Market Square Burra was sold to the Burra Burra DC for $17,500.  This building would make an ideal home for a tourist office.

Burra Burra DC

Council intends to apply for a debenture loan of $20,000 to finance purchase of a new office accounting machine and also a loan of $45,000 for two new tip trucks.  The existing trucks will be allocated to Mt Bryan and Burra DFS to modernise their plant.

Applications will soon be called for the position of District Clerk as Mr T.G. Perry is expected to retire at the end of 1980.

The Public Meeting on Burra Heritage attracted over 100 and several discussion groups were formed.  Some suggestions emerging from them were:

Tourism needs promotion

The Morgan-Spalding Road needs to be sealed as a basic tourist requirement

$1 spent in the town generates a further $2

The town and district cannot be seen separately

Burra is a living town with quality and character and new development should be in sympathy with that

The Burra Creek area needs development

A tourist office and officer are needed
