Indoor Bowls held a wind-up meeting for the year last Tuesday.  Playing members had decreased from 77 to 56 and the teams from 6 to 4.  20 rounds were played with the Ramblers emerging as premiers.  There was at present Â£1-1-5 in credit, but some adjustments will reduce this considerably.  In the year they had lost their old chairman Mr S. Kellaway at the start of the year when he decided not to play and his replacement R. Motley had to retire due to ill health.  J. Allen Sen. then took over.
