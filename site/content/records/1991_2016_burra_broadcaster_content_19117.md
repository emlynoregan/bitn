Burra Hospital is presently receiving strong community support to fund electric beds.  So far Burra has received funding for nine electric beds at a cost of $2,200 per bed.  The Burra Ladies’ Auxiliary has funded four.  Mr & Mrs Cliff Lucas funded three and the CWA and the Op Shop one each.  Electric beds are not only more comfortable for patients, but make life easier for staff, reducing the risk of strain injuries.
