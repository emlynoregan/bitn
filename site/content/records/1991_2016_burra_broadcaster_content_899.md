Fr David Lamont, ‘The Rectory’ Burra, writes also condemning ‘The Naked Revue’.  He is careful to articulate that he is not opposed to alcohol as such and finds nothing wrong with the human body either, but a naked revue is inappropriate in our community.  He is also disapproving of the combination of alcohol and the revue and fears that the revue is nothing but pornographic and erotic and sends a bad message to the youth of the district.
