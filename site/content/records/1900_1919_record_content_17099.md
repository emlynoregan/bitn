Obituary.  Richard Snell died in his Quarry St residence on Sunday last, aged 77.  He was a devout Christian and local preacher for the Wesleyans who came to SA on 17 October 1848.  In 1851 he went to California, returning to Australia and the Victorian diggings in 1852 and to SA later the same year.  He then returned to Victoria where all his children were born.  [The next issue says late of Campbell’s Creek, Victoria.]  About 1885 he returned to Burra.  He is survived by a widow, three daughters and two sons:  Mrs J. Hocking (Yackandandah), Mrs H. Young (Long Plain), Mrs F.J. Carey (Burra), Frederick (Kangarilla) and John H. (Angaston).  (All but one of them school teachers.)  [Died 29 April 1906.]
