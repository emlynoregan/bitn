Burra Burra DC has instituted the recycling of cardboard and paper from selected Burra businesses.  A woolpack and frame from Red-Line Waste Management of Kapunda will be filled and collected by them as required.  Residents can take part by taking their paper and cardboard to the woolpack at the Burra Rubbish Dump.  A possible kerbside recycling service is being investigated.
