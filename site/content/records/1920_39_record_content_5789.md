Editorial on ‘The Seventh Plague’

Grasshoppers have massed in the north and east.  Widespread destruction threatens and yet general apathy seems to prevail.  Only Mr I.J. Warnes has taken up arms against the foe with determination.  The editor makes a call to arms.  The mass reached Ketchowla on Friday.  The Mulga Hill property of John Collins has been stripped bare.
