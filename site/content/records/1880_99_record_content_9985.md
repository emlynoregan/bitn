The Foresters’ Sports Committee met on Monday at the Burra Hotel and showed a surplus of £22-2-6 and that sum together with the £7-13-3 left from last year was voted to the town’s poor.  £5-5-0 was immediately voted to a poor, but deserving widow and the rest was handed to the Mayor and Doctors to distribute.
