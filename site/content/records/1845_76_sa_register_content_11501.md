Rev. Wilson delivered a second lecture at the Institute on the 23 March.  It was a continuation of a former one on the manners and customs of the Friendly Islanders.  After Rev. Wilson had acknowledged a vote of thanks, Mr J.W. Powell expressed his regret on behalf of many that the Rev. Wilson was leaving the town.  He presented him with an address together with a purse containing 44 sovereigns.  [The text of the address is printed.]
