Burra Racing Club Ltd held its AGM at the Burra Town Hall Wednesday 1 September.

Chairman Gerald Gask reported.  In the 12 months we held two meetings.  The October one had to be postponed and we decided to avoid that again.  Some minor track alterations were needed.  We were lucky to escape this meeting with a small loss of £34.  The April meeting was held at Balaklava during the work on our track and it was a great success.  The profit was £830 with a gate of £438.  For the year the nett surplus is £712 and we expect to have nearly £700 in hand after paying for all improvements.  Taxation is expected to be fairly high.  The next meeting is in October.  We have nearly completed the new track.  Thanks go to Mr Lindsay Thomas for letting us purchase a portion of his paddock.  This enables an extension to the track, removing the necessity of horses going down a steep incline.  We have put in over 240 new posts and 900 yards of railing.  Thanks go to Rex, Jim and Tom Warnes for generosity in supplying and delivering 200 posts and to Mr Andrew Tennant for a donation of £100.  We have purchased the SAJC Judges’ Box and greatly improved the ladies’ toilet.  We note with regret the death of our only life member, Mr Cyril Collins.  Thanks also go to the CWA ladies for supplying a splendid luncheon and afternoon tea.  Elected were: Patron, Andrew Tennant and Chairman, Gerald Gask.  The next meeting at Burra will be on Wednesday 20 October when a six race program will be offered.
