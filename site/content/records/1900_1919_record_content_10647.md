A Cow visited the Commercial Hotel on Sunday evening and consumed some apple pies.  On the previous visit by one on Wednesday it had a drink.  In both cases the cows were owned by Rechabites who are shocked to think the animals should so far forget themselves as to eat and drink at the Commercial Hotel.
