The Bon Accord Hotel is under new management.  Mr G.D. Smallacombe is the new proprietor.  Before coming to Adelaide, Mr Smallacombe spent six years in WA.  He is keenly interested in sport (golf, cricket, football, tennis and racing.)  He played two seasons with the Perth League football team. He was Captain and coach of Carnarvon Football Club in WA 1925-28 and last season coached Goodwood Amateur League.  The Smallacombe Family will be remembered by many around Wirrabara and Booleroo as great racing men some 20-30 years ago.  Mr Smallacombe’s mother’s people came from that area.  Mrs Smallacombe was Miss Eileen Farrelly of the Glenelg Baths, a State Champion swimmer, who in 1921 received £50 and a gold watch from the people of Glenelg for her plucky rescue of two girls.  The hotel is to be renovated and put in first class order.
