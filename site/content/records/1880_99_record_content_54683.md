The Editor published one of five letters expressing disgust at the Council proceedings – it reveals one of the charges brought by Cr Harris – that the engineer neglected his duties in several ways – ‘among others that he was informed that the engineer was in a certain blacksmith’s shop for four hours.’  The writer felt an investigation was called for to discover the truth.
