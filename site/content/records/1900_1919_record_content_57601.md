Mr Warnes was concerned that the costs of infectious cases were not covered by the agreement with the Local Board of Health, but the others felt little could be done as the agreement was the same as in Adelaide.  Mr Warnes said it would be fair if all infectious cases were sent to the hospital, but Dr Williams said many could be satisfactorily isolated at home.  The hospital decided to end its agreement with the Railways & Tramways Hospital Fund, as the reimbursements received did not nearly match the costs of their members.
