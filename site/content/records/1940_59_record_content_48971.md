Local Board of Health

The Inspector for the Local Licensing Court said despite a new septic tank, the Burra Hotel was far from satisfactory.  Bathroom facilities were below standard and he would have no hesitation in opposing the licence.  The Board said they had been working on the problem for some time and the difficulties in obtaining materials and labour were a major factor.  It was resolved that Dr Mellor and Inspector Bruce make a further inspection and Dr Mellor tender a report to the Board.

An order was made to remedy sanitary problems at the property occupied by K.J. Treleaven & Nankivell Bros.
