Anzac Services were held in Burra at the War Memorial on Sunday.  There was a large attendance and the Salvation Army [Hindmarsh] Citadel Band supported the service.  A large number of returned men paraded for the march, which departed from the RSL Rooms in Market Square and went to the hospital and then to the War Memorial under the command of the RSL Sub-Branch President, Mr M.G. Dobson.  The service was jointly conducted by Adjutant Chapman and Revs. Pettet, Dorman and Pitman.
