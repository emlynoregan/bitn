Obituary.  Mr Philip Lane JP died rather suddenly last Wednesday at his residence in Kooringa aged 79.  He was an old identity in the district and was known to everyone.  He arrived at Pt Adelaide by the Princess Royal in 1847 and came to Burra, where he started in business as a saddler and harness maker.  During the Victorian goldrush Mr Lane travelled by the second boat to leave Pt Adelaide, but soon returned to his business.  In 1874-75 he was a District Councillor and agitated for a Town Council.  When this was brought about he was rewarded by being elected the first Mayor; a position he held for four years.  After fifty years of successful business in the town he handed it on to his son Mr S.M. Lane JP about two years ago.  He held many positions in the town over the years:

Member of the School Board of Advice for more than ten years.

By his agency the town secured the land for Victoria Park.

He was a string advocate for the establishment of the Public School.

He was also a strong supporter of the Institute, of which he was a trustee.

For many years he was the visiting JP at Redruth Gaol.

For more than forty years he was a member of the British & Foreign Bible Society â€“ mostly as its treasurer.

He was a member of the Burra Benevolent Society from its inception.

He initiated tree planting in the town and collected the first money to make it work.

A long-time member of the Burra Agricultural Society.

He was asked several times to stand for Parliament.

Mr Lane was married for almost 50 years and is survived by his widow and a grown up family of two sons and six daughters:

Philip of Broken Hill

Stanley M. of Burra

Mrs H. Roach of Burra

Mrs A.J McBride of Burra

And Florrie, Mary, Annie and Muriel.

He was an old member of the Methodist Church and had filled every office in connection with the local church.  [Born 1833, Winkleigh, Devonshire, UK: died 18 December 1912, Kooringa.]
