Pte V.S. Armstrong (Son-in-law to N. Hiles Pearse.)

He writes of defeating the (Vichy) French forces in Syria, where many of the troops were French colonial troops from Senegal and Indo-China and members of the French Foreign Legion.  He reports being in at the fall of Damascus.  He reports not being taken much by the Palestinian Arabs, who were dirty and lived in squalid mud huts along with their animals.  The Syrian Arabs were cleaner and had a better class of home, but he didnâ€™t like the narrow lanes of Damascus.  He went to the races in Beirut, where there were no bookies, but only a tote operated entirely in French and therefore hard to follow. He found Syria a very pretty country with beautiful mountains and snow on the larger ones.  Some of the villages looked quite smart with well-built stone houses and tiled roofs that must look picturesque in winter.
