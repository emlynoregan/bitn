Burra Bowling Club held its AGM at the Burra Hotel 4 August.  Secretary J.T. Pascoe reported a good year.  The overdraft had been slightly reduced, largely due to good support from the Ladies’ Croquet Club.  Membership had fallen slightly.  Interclub matches were quite successful this year with eight wins from thirteen matches.  The Kapunda Cup was retained, but the shield was again lost to Clare.  A plague of grasshoppers in the year greatly affected the green, but it has now largely recovered.  Elected were: Patron, Dr Steele, President, E.J. Davey; Vice-Presidents, M. Pearce & H. Mumme and Secretary & Treasurer, J.T. Pascoe.
