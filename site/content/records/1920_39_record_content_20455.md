Harrison was placed in a cell preparatory for removal to Adelaide by Tuesday morning’s train.  The prisoner was seen sleeping at 12.15 a.m. but at 5.10 a.m. the lock had been sprung and the prisoner was gone.  During Monday night a 6-cylinder car was stolen from Burra Hotel Garage (Reg. No. 018).  There is no doubt the prisoner’s release was the work of a confederate.  The police are said to have good information of the escapee and his mate’s whereabouts.  Six cases of petrol were also taken from the Burra Railway Station.  A speeding car passed through Braemar Station at 5 a.m. Tuesday.
