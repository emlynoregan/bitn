There are hints in the 1927 and 1928 papers of the economic depression that was to be so devastating in the early 1930s.  Unemployment in Adelaide is mentioned as significant and many applicants for available jobs had already been cited from rural Farrell’s Flat.  In this paper the Robertstown correspondent writes of the many city people living beyond their means and makes reference to Promissory Notes and Cash Order Schemes.  Extended payment for motor cars is cited as a problem as well.  The apparent failure of the SAFU store in Burra may also have been a foretaste of declining consumer spending and cash flow problems.  The report of the seaside trip in the next issue revealed conditions in the city were already a shock to the country visitors.]
