Burra Town Council, 28 April.

Burra Football Assoc was granted use of the football ground for Â£2-2-0 for the season.

Children have been wasting water at public gardens by turning on hoses.  Arrangements are to be made to leave hoses at adjacent houses.

There are problems arising from the quality of carbide in the streetlamps.
