Redruth Methodist Jubilee Celebrations.

The jubilee should really have been celebrated in 1901 as the work of Methodism in Redruth began in 1851.  It was resolved in preparation for the event that a history of the church be prepared and an earnest effort be made to have a genuine revival at his time and that the plan for enlarging the former Primitive Methodist Church be worked in with it.

The class meeting at 9 a.m. and the prayer meeting at 10 a.m. were marked with great fervour.  The President of Conference, Rev. J. Cowperthwaite, preached at the 11 a.m. service.  At 2 p.m. the keys were given to Miss Reed as Secretary of the United Methodist Sunday School to open the door to Jubilee Hall.  The President and secretary of the Conference then entered with J. Tiver, Superintendent of the Sunday school and then the teachers and scholars.  Rev. H.J. Pope then preached the first service to the children who were also addressed by the President.  An adult service followed at 3 p.m.  The evening service by Rev. Cowperthwaite was followed by a Love Feast when many testified to the saving power of the Gospel.

E.W. Crewes was unavoidably unable to preside at the banquet on Wednesday and his place was taken by the President of the Conference.  At 3.30 he also presided at the Historic Meeting.  Rev. W.F. James gave an historical sketch of Redruth Methodism.  Rev. H.J. Pope, who laboured in the Primitive Methodist Circuit some 30 years ago also gave some reminiscences as did Mr Rabbich and N. Coombe.  May’s brass band played before the tea meeting at 5.30.  The enforced absence of Rev. T.B. Anguin was regretted.

Historic Sketch by W.F. James.

Rev. D.J. Draper opened the first Wesleyan Church at Kooringa in 1847 when there was no other place of worship within 70 miles.  There were three Wesleyan and one or two Primitive Methodist ministers in the colony and the first two Bible Christian ministers arrived three years later.  The work was done chiefly by local preachers and about 60 members were reported.  Rev. John Harcourt came in 1848 and took in Princess Royal, Tothill Scrub, Kapunda and Angaston.  The primitive Methodist and Bible Christian ministers later had a similar area.

Redruth first appeared in the quarterly minute book on 24 June 1851.  No members are listed and the income was 5/4.  Three months later there were 4 members and the circuit income was £1-6-6.  In February 1851 the Kooringa trustees had begun to build a church opposite the police station and £1-17-10 was collected at the laying of the corner stone.  The church cost £228.  £98 was raised by subscription and the Government gave £130.  Soon almost all the men went to the Victorian gold fields and for a while services continued for the women and children, but in 1854 the church was dismantled and the roof, floor, windows, doors, pulpit and seats were used for the Spring Farm Church in the Clare District.  Redruth disappeared from the Burra Circuit.

In 1857 the Kooringa trustees restored the Redruth Church.  Their own church had been enlarged and they utilised the old windows, pulpit and part of the roof in the new church at Redruth.  £20 was raised and £130 borrowed at 10%.  By 1863 the debt stood at £108.  In 1865 £40 was spent on renovation and in 1874 the debt was £84.  In that year the present church was erected.  The old church was then sold for £5 and not a vestige of it remains.

The Sunday school began in a stable near Mr Austin’s store.  Mr B. Preece, who is still alive, was the first Superintendent and Willie Torr, now Dr Torr of Way College, was one of the early scholars.  The Band of Hope was a great success.  Personal reminiscences mention the following people: Miss Torr (now Mrs Dale of Penzance, Cornwall), Mr Sampson of Hampton, Sammy Goss, William Torr, John & Mrs Pascoe, Mr & Mrs Goodrich, George Shirter (a Negro), Mr Davey, Charles Oldham, California Taylor, Dr Stephens, John Boddiner, Mrs Handford, George Sara, William West, A. Bartholomaeus and Rev. J.H. Goss.

31 July 1873 saw a new trust formed.  The church block was bought for £100 and on 4 August it was decided to build a church to seat c. 200 and to cost c. £400.  R. Rees was chosen to draw the plans and J. Tiver to supervise the work.  On 3 March 1874 the tender of J. Pearce was accepted for £600.  Stone laying services yielded £57 and donations totalled £150.  A July bazaar yielded £102 and one in September £40 and the opening service in September £34, to total almost £400 in one year.  The schoolroom, now the transept, cost £265, the seats nearly £100, so that the total was £1,340 of which £900 was borrowed at 7%.  In 1879 the wall between the church and the schoolroom was taken down to make the church its present size, at a cost of £65.  The debt was reduced to £360 in nine years.

For 23 years the Sunday school was held in the German Chapel.

In 1882 the corner allotment east of the church was bought for a new schoolroom at a cost of £200.  £170 of this was raised by donations and a bazaar.

New seats and other expenditure brought the debt to £530 in 1884.  Reduction of the debt began again and at present it stands at £122 and it is hoped to lessen it by £22 this year.  Twelve years ago £616 was paid for the manse and land for the stable.  £374 has been raised leaving this debt at £242.  Altogether Wesleyan property at Redruth and Aberdeen has cost almost £3,000 and the total debt is £564.

A.H. Forder was treasurer for 25 years and did much to further the successful operation of the trust.  A. Batholomaeus followed in his path for four years.  Thirteen years ago the Burra Wesleyan Circuit was divided and Redruth became a separate circuit.  The Revs T.M. Rowe, J. Hopkins, D.S. Wylie, W.A. Langsford & W.H. Rofe preceded the present minister.  When the circuit was formed there were 98 members and a similar number on union, but the great number of removals has masked much good work done.

Rev. J.G. Write began Primitive Methodist services in the open air at Redruth c. 44 years ago and the church was built soon after.  Its cost was £670 and when it opened £97 had been raised and £570 borrowed. (£150 at 12% and £420 at 12½% to total £78 p.a.)  The following June in a series of efforts to raise money £72 was collected in 5 days.  In 1862 [? The 2 is unclear] the debt was £374 and for many years between £70 & £80 was raised for the trust.  Few churches have been so changed without being altered in size.  About 30 years ago the back and front walls had to be rebuilt at a cost of £86 and subsequently the slate roof had to be replaced with one of iron.  The debt was reduced to £200 where it has remained.  Some years ago the land at the corner of the street was bought for £50, but the proposed larger church was never built.  The Sunday school once had 17 officers and teachers and 100 scholars and there were strong Mutual Improvement and Temperance Societies, but the church was weakened by removals.  Including improvements the Methodist property at Redruth cost nearly £4,000 and its present debt is £564.

On Methodist Union in 1900 the Primitive Methodist Church in Redruth was closed.  The Union involved some reluctance and it has taken the Jubilee celebrations to complete it in people’s hearts.  The addition of Iron Mine and Copperhouse Primitive Methodist Churches to the circuit has strengthened it.  In the 11 years before the Union the Wesleyan Circuit had a deficiency of £267 of which the Home Mission fund made up £142 and ministers salaries fell short by £125.  The circuit since Union has been in credit.  After Union the Primitive Methodist Church was to be the Sunday school, but this was not at once done and disrepair and interest owed both grew.  Action last January saw new trustees take action and the west wall was taken down as unsafe and the building extended 10 feet to accommodate the Sunday school and it was renamed Jubilee Hall.  A tender by Messrs Launder, Griffiths & Pearce was accepted.  On 7 April not 1d was on hand and it was seen undesirable to increase the debt of £200 on the building.  On 7 May six memorial stones were laid and £52 was raised.  Since then £30 more has been raised and the trustees are anxious to receive the balance speedily.
