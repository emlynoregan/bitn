The Old Age Pension Act.  There is a ¾ column article on the working of the Act.  To get the pension you had to apply to the local registrar (the clerk of the local court) for the forms.  There were three to be filled in.

One of 38 questions to be completed by the applicant.

Two with 30 questions to be completed by persons who had known the applicant for 25 years.

The forms then had to be declared before a JP, Minister of Religion etc. as stipulated in the Act.

The Registrar then examined the forms and, if necessary, corrected them.

He then instructed the local policeman to enquire into the character of the applicant and whether he or his wife owned property.

The Town Clerk then had to supply a valuation of any such property and a similar application was made to the applicant’s bank manager.

The applicants then had to wait until a sufficient number of such applications had accumulated in the area for a magistrate to hear a group of cases.

The applicants were then sworn in and examined by the Special Magistrate and successful applicants got £1 a fortnight.

In Burra over 100 claims had been heard.  The Act was inaugurated on 1 July 1909.
