Christmas Holidays.

Christmas Eve began by being windy and dusty, but towards evening grew calmer and cool.  The streets were filled with the usual Christmas crowds.  The Burra Band played around the shops as usual.  Christmas Day was fine and passed off quietly.  Boxing Day was more exciting with sports in the Park which attracted a crowd.  Various cricket matches were played and picnics organised.
