2nd Leader.  The Town Council

Instead of the better feeling hoped for recently, a storm is raging in the local council and it is not yet finished.  Last year through some bungling on the part of Cr Hardy, who was going in for economy, Mr Littlejohn was actually re-appointed as Waterworks engineer at £3 a week, an increase of £30 p.a.  This was in opposition to Cr Hardy’s wish and since then he has not had a good word to say for the engineer.  Plots have been devised to oust him, but all have proved futile, though he has had an unpleasant time.  Last Saturday a breakage at the works saw water cut from the town and to get it back as soon as possible an extra man was employed.  Crs Hardy & Kitchen considered Mr Littlejohn should pay for the extra labour.  This was absurd and foolish and we are glad the motion of Cr Hardy was lost.  The engineer works very often from 4 or 5 a.m. to 7 or 8 p.m. and two or three hours on Sunday and yet is asked for more!  We are surprised the Mayor stopped Cr Linkson from speaking because there was no motion before the chair.  He probably forgot he had allowed other Councillors to speak two or three times previously without a motion before the chair.  Cr Linkson was annoyed and left the room when Cr Hardy’s motion was brought forward.  It was not likely he was going to vote for or against a motion when he was not allowed to give his opinion on it.  The Mayor should study Standing Orders and use them in a proper manner.
