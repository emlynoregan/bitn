Barkers of Baldina Cottage Homes

Approval has been given for the drawing up of specifications for the erection of nine cottage homes on the site west of the Burra Hospital.  The architects will now draw up plans and specifications for submission to Federal and State authorities for subsidy approval.  The late J.R. Barker bequeathed $70,000 for the project and nominated a board comprising: R.K. Pearse, R.B. Jennison, Mrs L.M. Fyfe, Mrs M. Odgers, E.J. Ashby, J. Dewhirst, D.M. Bednall, J. Gordon, M. Carmody, R. Reed and L.H. Packer as Administrator.

The nine cottages will be self contained and run east-west parallel to the main road.  Each will be air conditioned with a bedroom, kitchen-lounge, laundry, toilet and front verandah, carport and garden space.  They can be used as double or single units.  In the event of more applicants than there are vacancies preference will be given to residents or persons with an association with the area within the District Councils of Burra, Hallett and Robertstown.  Rental is estimated to be $12 for a double unit and $8 for a single, payable fortnightly in advance.  Occupants are to pay for telephones, electricity and power.  The board will pay rates and taxes and maintenance.  Standard built-in furniture will be supplied and a washing machine, electric range, refrigerator, air conditioner, wall heater, curtains, floor coverings, beds, mattresses, pillows and bed spreads.  Any gift or donation on occupancy would be appreciated, but is not a requirement, nor will it affect priority of acceptance.  It is expected that tenders for erection work will be called soon.
