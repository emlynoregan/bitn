RSL held its AGM in the club rooms on 10 December.

The treasurer reported a gradual fall in receipts:	1929	£30-6-10

1930	£26-11-4

1931	£24-5-8

1932	£23-15-2

Membership had been 50 in 1931 and was 48 in 1932.

The president reported a difficult year lacking in practical support from members.  The Anzac Smoke Social was not as well attended as hoped for on 23 April, though Anzac Day, celebrated on Sunday 24 April, was one of the best for years, aided by the Burra Brass Band.  The collection went to aid Partially Blinded Soldiers’ Fund, The Tuberculosis Aid Society and the AIF Cemetery Trust.  The Annual Ball was very successful, though attendance was smaller than anticipated.  A fine portrait of Sir John Monash was acquired with the aid of £1-1-0 from the Burra Town Council.  The Poppy Day Appeal organised by the Mayoress Mrs T.H. Woollacott raised £4-17-6.  Armistice Day was observed with a short ceremony.  D. Keynes & S. Cordon collected 25 bags of wheat for Angorichina Hostel.  The Brandt Fund has paid £21 to the beneficiary leaving a credit of £27-15-1.

[The previous AGM in February reported payments of £116-12-2 from this fund leaving a balance of £46-18-11.  If the £21 was paid from this it would have left £25-18-11.  The figure cited above suggests some income for the fund: perhaps interest, as the difference is about 7%.]

Mr Dow raised a question of the legality of calling the AGM in December rather than in March.  He insisted on sticking to the letter of the constitution concerning notice for changes etc.

Eventually he moved that the meeting confirm the action of the committee in changing the date of the AGM and this was carried.

A sports meeting was suggested for the 25 April and the committee is to decide whether to hold a sports meeting or a ball or both.  Elected: President, H.J.B. Jennison; Vice-Presidents, T.J. Canny & J.H. Morrison; Hon. Secretary, G.H. Dow and Treasurer, M.G. Dobson.
