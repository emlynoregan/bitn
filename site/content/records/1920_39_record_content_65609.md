Mongolata Goldfield

Bylesâ€™ Mongolata GM.  Work resumed on 12 January.  No. 1 tunnel has been fairly successful with one vein widening & showing gold by pan test.  A new tunnel was begun 80ft further down the hill to get under old works and has advanced 25ft.  Sinking north of present works has reached 12ft and looks encouraging.
