354 (5) [1, 1895]

The series then begins using numbers not previously used and runs fairly regularly from 355 to 397, although the following irregularities do occur:

355, 384 & 395 are used twice (the second use of 384 sits irregularly between 386 & 388)

356, 363, 376, 377, 378 & 387 are not used.

The jump from 375 to 379 occurred when the ‘6’ destined to make up 376 was placed upside-down to read 379.
