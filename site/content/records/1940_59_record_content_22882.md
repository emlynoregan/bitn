Burra VP Celebrations were well over on Monday 20 August, when one of Burra’s soldiers on Bougainville sat down to write a letter home – saying that he and his comrades felt that peace must be near and they were looking forward to receiving the news at the weekend.  Two or three days later he wirelessed that news of the Peace had been received.
