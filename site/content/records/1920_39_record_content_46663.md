Frank Treloar: Looking Back (Continued)

21 April 1847.  Second Annual Report of SAMA.  In the past six months 3,481 tons were raised and the overseas price was between £31-9-0 and £10-10-0 per ton with an average £16 per ton gross, leaving a clear profit of about £3,200.  Further shipments then at Swansea would bring this average to £17-4-0 per ton.

As soon as ore waiting at Pt Adelaide was shipped the directors intended to declare a dividend of at least 50% on capital.  They decided to sink Graham’s Shaft at once and decided to go ahead with smelting experiments.  Horses and horse feed were being bought and the rate of cartage from the Mine to Pt Adelaide was raised to £3 per ton with return goods at £2 per ton.

4 May 1847.  The directors instructed that no goats were to be allowed on the lands of the SAMA.  They appointed themselves as a committee to wait on the Governor seeking permission to import Chinese labour.

15 June 1847.  Directors resolved that a first dividend of 50% on capital or 50/- per share be declared.

22 June 1847.  Matthew Bryant was appointed second Captain at the Mine at £150 p.a.

29 June 1847.  The secretary’s salary was increased to £250 p.a.

6 July 1847.  A second dividend of 50/- per share was declared.

30 July 1847.  Miners’ wages were cut to 30/- a week and labourers’ to 23/-.
