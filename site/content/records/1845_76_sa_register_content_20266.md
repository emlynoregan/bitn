Kooringa News, 20 March

Reports from the Barrier Ranges differ, but most in Burra discredit those suggesting any significant success.  Reports come from bushmen and are not given much credence.

The Wesleyan Chapel had a tea meeting on 19 March to benefit the Circuit debt, but it was thinly attended.

Redruth Wesleyan Sunday School held its Anniversary on 17 March.  Tea and cakes and a public meeting followed as usual on Monday and in all £7 was raised.

The present take at the Mine will end on 28 March and all underground working will then cease.  Some say the pumping engine will also be stopped.

This would force the suspension of work on the new shaft, now at 30 fathoms – 10 fathoms below water level.  The miners say that if the water rose to that height the oldest workings would collapse and could not be re-opened without great expense.  Most levels are kept ‘abroad’ by timber supported by ‘addle’ or rubbish and would collapse when submerged.

Mr Richards licensed spirit storekeeper was charged with selling less than one gallon of brandy – the smallest amount he is allowed to retail.  After evidence from Zechariah Rees and Julius Stevens the Bench decided Richards was guilty and he was fined £10 plus £2 costs.  Mr Benham for Mr Richards gave verbal notice of appeal.

The miners have not appointed any delegation to seek railway work.
