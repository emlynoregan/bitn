Burra Town Council, 19 February

There was some discussion over who should represent the Council on the hospital Board.  Cr Jennison having retired from Council, Cr Kellaway was of the view Council could appoint anyone, but Cr Bevan thought they had to appoint a sitting Councillor.

The Mayor said there were already five members of Council on the Board, though not by virtue of being Councillors.  Mr Jennison had approached the Mayor and it was his place to put the matter officially to Council.  Cr Kellaway said the rules say ‘a representative appointed by the Council’.  He felt until they were officially notified the position was vacant it was a roughshod method to appoint another.  The Mayor held the present position to be illegal.  The Town Clerk had informed the Board that Cr Jennison was the representative and now there was no Cr Jennison.  He had automatically ceased to be a representative when he ceased to be a Councillor.

Cr Kellaway’s motion to defer consideration lapsed and eventually Cr Riggs was appointed.
