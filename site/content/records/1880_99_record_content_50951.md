After the minutes were read Cr Parks moved the room be cleared of strangers and the Council then became chaotic as they argued over procedural matters.

There was high farce as the Mayor asked Mr Davey to leave the room and no movement occurred.  Eventually the Town Clerk (William Davey) suggested they specify which Mr Davey, as the Burra Record reporter was Mr W.J. Davey.  So after consultation with Cr Parks, the Mayor specified that it was Mr Davey of the Burra Record who was to leave.

Cr Linkson asked for that to be minuted and the Mayor objected.  Cr Linkson said that the by-laws provided for any Councillor to ask for certain statements to be taken down.  Cr Harris then moved the Council adjourn for a fortnight.  Cr Parks 2nd.

Cr Linkson then moved that three Councillors [Linkson, West and Walsh] go on with the business of the town.

The Mayor was then taunted by Linkson for not clearing the room:

‘The mayor is frightened to put it into effect.’

This was followed by a call for him to withdraw the remark and further verbal skirmishing.

In the ensuing confusion the amendment appears to have been lost on the casting vote of the Mayor and the motion to adjourn to a date to be fixed passed in the same manner.

Cr Linkson tried to carry on with the Local Board of Health Meeting, but the meeting ended at that point.
