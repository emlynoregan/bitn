Redruth Court, 26 June.

Fines of 2/6 + 5/- costs were imposed on each of the following for allowing cows to stray:

J. Edwards	E. Crewes	F. Carey

C. Woodruff	S. Burns	J. Pearce

C. Voumard	F. Bourman

R.L. Goldsworthy was fined 5/- + 5/- for driving too fast round a certain corner.

George Ramhit, cook at Mt Bryan Station was charged by Frederick Page, labourer, with assault.  After evidence of assault by both parties and a claim from Ramhit that his assault was in self defence, the court rules that it was indeed self defence, but he had used unnecessary violence and fined Ramhit £1 + 15/- costs.

L-C Thomas was presented with an illuminated address at the Council Chamber on Wednesday night last.  Cr W.T. Rabbich took the chair in the absence of the Mayor.  Other speakers were Cr Parks, W. Davey (Town Clerk), Rev. H.J. Parkinson, J. Lane (Postmaster) & Cr Hardy.

‘Would Like to Know’ wonders why a doctor was not called to give evidence in the Page v. Ramhit case.
