Burra Town Council

Cr Bevan expressed his concern that no tenders had been called for the work done by the Waterworks Department at Mongolata.

The Mayor agreed it appeared the wrong thing to do.  There was considerable discussion on the principle and Cr Bevan wanted it drawn to the attention of the authorities and if the Council would not act he would take it up with the district MPs.

The Town Clerk pointed out that Mongolata was in the area of the Mt Bryan District Council and they might be stepping on toes.

An employee of Mongolata Block 8 has complained to the company of sanitary arrangements on the field.  It has been decided to sink a pit.
