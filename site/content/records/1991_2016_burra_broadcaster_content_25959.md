Collinsville Ram Sale.  Paddy and Helen Handbury were greatly relieved when buyers paid up to $18,000 for a ram in a total on-property clearance that grossed $209,000 and averaged $1,943.50.  After the sale Paddy expressed his relief that he and his team had finally managed to drag Australiaâ€™s premier Merino genetics business back from the brink after six years of struggle.  He said there was no doubt that Collinsville was on its last legs when they took it over from the bank.  They had had to put in much capital, effort and faith.
