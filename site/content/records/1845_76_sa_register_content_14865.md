21 September 1861, page 3

Obituary/Inquest.  J.B. Anderson JP conducted an inquest on Thursday into the death of William Peters who committed suicide the previous evening.

Susan Peters; wife of the deceased:

He committed suicide at about 5 p.m.  He had been in a very low sate after going unsuccessfully to seek work at Black Point about five weeks ago.  He had never threatened or attempted suicide before.  He had been looking for the lost child.  When he came home I asked about the child and he said he was all right.  They had got him out of a well and he had seen him carried home.  He went into the bedroom and soon afterwards my little girl said there was something wrong with him.  I called out to him and then went in and found him on the floor, bleeding.  She had not quarrelled with her husband and he was not addicted to drinking.  He had been acting strangely since his return from Black Point and she had thought it prudent to conceal his razor and such things, though she did not think he would cut his throat.

John Rowe:

Heard Mrs Peters scream and rushed over there.  As I reached the door Mrs Peters rushed out of the bedroom and fell on the floor in front of the chimney.  Saw Peters on his back with blood gushing from his throat.  Saw him move his foot a little and then came out.  Knew Peters quite well for about two years.  He had been rather strange since his return from Black Point.  Had not spoken to him in the last fortnight.  He had never mentioned that he had contemplated suicide.

James Opie gave evidence corroborating Rowe’s.

Dr Mayne gave evidence of examining Peters who was dead when he arrived.  Deceased had severed the principal arteries in his neck.  The cut had extended from ear to ear down to the spinal column.  Deceased was about 37, but did not look so old.  Had not previously attended him and so know nothing of his peculiarities.

The jury decided that the deceased had committed suicide whilst under a fit of temporary insanity.

[William Peters died 19 September 1861, Kooringa aged 30.  BISA says his wife was born Susanna Bennetts and had previously been married to John Hodge.  They arrived in Australia in 1851 and John died 26 November 1858 at Kooringa aged 36.  They had a daughter Elizabeth born c. 1851.  Susanna (or Susan) married William Peters at Kooringa 18 November 1860 at Kooringa.  At the time of Peters’ suicide she was pregnant and Susan Ann Peters was born 12 February 1862 at Kooringa.  Mrs Peters married John Bone (30) on 16 August 1862 at Kooringa and they had a son, John Bone born 23 December 1863 at Kooringa.]
