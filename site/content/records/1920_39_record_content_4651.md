Cr Treloar was concerned with the problem of cost blow-out if any doctor could send patients in to hospital at the Local Board’s cost.  Recently the diphtheria cases had shown the potential with bills of £70.  The problem was where and how to draw the line in emergency cases.

They debated whether to adhere to only funding patients admitted by their officer or whether to judge emergency cases after the event.  In the end they carried a motion to adhere strictly to their decision, but strangely understood that in urgent cases the Board would take responsibility without the Health Officer’s sanction [though this would not appear in any resolution of the Board!]
