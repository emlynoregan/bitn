Advt.  Burra Talkies, 12 & 13 September

The Bells of St Mary’s

Burra Hospital is very short of nursing staff.  They have three probationers and are entitled to employ 8.

Burra Cycle Club.  A ball will be held in the RSL rooms.  Proceeds will go towards the £15-15-0 for the annual Burra-Adelaide Race to be run on 20 September.

Burra Mine.  When Cr S.J. Woollacott suggested buying the Burra Mine for the town he meant the mine site itself and the adjacent quarry.  He did not intend that the whole property be bought.  He believed the royalties from the quarry would meet the interest payments.
