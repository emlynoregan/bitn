A New Heysen Trail Sign, located in the Burra Creek [Pickett] Reserve was handed over to the community last week.  The sign provides details of the Heysen Trail.  The sign is a co-operative effort, funded by The Friends of the Heysen Trail, produced by the Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources and installed by the Regional Council of Goyder.  It includes a map of the trail and a description of the various sections.  The trail runs 1,200 km from Cape Jervis to Parachilna Gorge in the Flinders Ranges.

[Pictures with the sign are Jess Humphrys (Goyder Council Tourist Officer), Paula Jones (Manager of the Burra Visitor information Centre), Rodney Rees (President of Burra Branch of Friends of the Heysen Trail), Hugh Greenhill (Burra member of Friends of the Heysen Trail) and Robert Alcock (President of Friends of the Heysen Trail).
