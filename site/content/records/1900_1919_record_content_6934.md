W.J. Davey gave a long speech in support of his candidacy for East Ward, but much of it was little to the point.  He did however, favour economy and commonsense and other motherhood issues.  He was also in favour of kerbing and further tar dressing, if it were done better, as the present process was a waste of money.  He was strongly against the rule that work in a ward was only available to men that lived in that ward.  West Ward had only 2 or 3 out of work ever and had the most money to spend.  East Ward had 10 or 12 men out of work who could not get work in West Ward!

Using rubble instead of road metal was penny wise and pound foolish.  The title to the cemetery road was needed and it needed improving.  The path to the Post Office was badly lit and if the cost was not too great he would like to see two lamps placed along it.  The cemetery needed to be made more presentable.  He thought the slaughterhouse question, which had been sleeping all year, needed to be resolved.  He favoured trees in parklands etc.  He congratulated the Mayor on three successful terms and would have liked him to have had a fourth.  He also congratulated the Mayor-elect and was sure he would do his duties satisfactorily with his 14 years experience of Council.  He was the nominee of no party and would vote independently.
