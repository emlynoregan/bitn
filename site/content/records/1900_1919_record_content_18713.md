Editorial on Christmas.  After the usual comments on Christmas traditions, Father Christmas and the like, the writer says that commercially 1906 brought little change to Burra.  The Mine is still doing nothing, though it now has better prospects than for some time.  Farmers have had a hard time, but even so the yield will be better than that reaped three or four years ago.  Except for the wool industry Burra has nothing to commend itself at present and it is surprising that it has kept up so well.
