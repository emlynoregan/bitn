Accident.  On Tuesday morning Mr Penrose, a drover, and two other men were driving a trap into town along Kingston St when a wheel came off.  The horses bolted along Commercial St and the two passengers were thrown out, but the driver held on and managed to halt the horses in front of the hospital.  The men were not hurt.  On the way home in the afternoon the horses bolted at about the same place and the driver was thrown out at the bridge at Diprose’s Ck and was unconscious a short time.  He could not find the horses and trap till the next morning when he found the trap capsized about five miles from the bridge.  The horses had returned to the camp where one of them died.
