Perpetual Lease Properties will be offered freehold in a move to secure greater security and improved tenure in agricultural areas.  This offer does not extend to leases under the War Service Land Settlement Act and neither does it extend to rangeland pastoral country.  It is likely to be offered to some 5,000 leaseholders.
