Our Mines [Editorial]

One of the most useful chapters in the South Australian Handbook [by J.B. Austin] is that dealing with the mines of SA. It begins with the Burra Burra Mine and after describing how it became the possession of the SA Mining Association the author say that the first blast was made in the rock on 29 September 1845.  The employees then comprised ten miners, a smith and a captain.  Since then work had continued almost without intermission to the extent of providing employment for upwards of eleven hundred individuals and indirectly to many thousands.  Despite the crude methods of operation in the early years, the product of the first six years amounted to nearly eight thousand tons of copper ore, of a richness not met with before in mining history.  Despite having to cart these ores over one hundred miles of unmade road to a port and then ship them to a market some sixteen thousand miles distant, the profit from working the mines for that period amounted to £438,552.  The company’s working capital in September 1845 had been about £1,500.  In 1851, however, the prosperity of the company was checked by the discovery of gold in the adjacent provinces.  By the early part of 1852 the number of workers available at the mine had fallen from 1,042 to 366 and later to only 100.  The pumping engines were stopped and the water allowed to rise in the mine to its natural level.  Operations were limited to the dry levels.  This situation prevailed till the latter part of 1854 and might have continued longer has not the Governor H.E.F. Young and his Government taken prompt measures to introduce a large number of Cornish copper miners.  Work recommenced in January 1855.  To date there has been no falling off in the supply of ore, though increasing depth has reduced the profit margin.  For many years now the annual production has been between 10,000 and 13,000 tons, of from 22-23% copper or about 2,500 tons of metallic copper, worth to the colony at least £225,000 p.a.  Direct expenditure within the colony by the company since operations started amounts to £1,640,000, of which upwards of £1,000,000 has been in wages.  The gross profit stands at £836,000, of which £677,000 has been divided among shareholders, £147,840 added to the capital stock and £10,560 remains undivided.  The greatest number of hands employed was in 1859, when it amounted to 1,170 individuals.  Common labourers’ wages have fluctuated from 25/- to 40/- per week and of miners from 35/- to 60/-, with tributers sometimes making very much more.  Mechanics wages have varied from 42/- to 112/- per week.

The Kapunda Mine was the next mine in importance until the discoveries recently on Yorke’s Peninsula.  The first ore was raised here on 8 January 1844 and in December 1849 the first smelting furnace commenced work.  When the Victorian gold rush began operations were suspended and not resumed until March 1855, when miners returned in large numbers.  Up to the close of 1861 a total of 35,280 tons of 21 cwt had been raised at an average of 20% copper.  In the past year 3,306 tons averaging 18.15% were raised.  The deepest level is 60 fathoms and tributers are working to 50 fathoms.  Almost all workings are on the original 80 acre section 1271.  Other sections are also owned.  There is a smelting works and all ore raised is now reduced to fine copper before shipment.  595 tons were shipped in 1861.  The year’s expenditure was £48,300; most of which was in wages and fuel.

On Yorke’s Peninsula the total quantity of ore raised at the Wallaroo Mine to 31 January 1861 (1862?) was 11,370 tons of which 5,370 have been shipped to Melbourne and Sydney with about 6,000 tons remaining at the Wallaroo Smelting Works.  These works at present have ten reducing furnaces and three refineries, with ten extra reducing furnaces are being erected.  The ores average 15-25% copper.  About 400 men are directly employed at the mine and about 90 at the smelting works.  Two steam engine of combined power of about 180 horses are already employed here and three more of a united 195 horse-power have been ordered.

At Moonta there were 68 men working in February and about 200 tons of ore had been shipped, while 450 tons were awaiting shipment.  Other mines noted on Yorke’s Peninsula are those of the New Cornwall Mineral Association and the Duryea Mining Co.

In the Far North the Great Northern Mines began in June 1860 and have been pursued with vigour.  At first all work was by hand, but a steam engine, whims and ore crusher is expected to be operational by May.  600 tons or ore have been shipped to England and 90-100 tons is in the course of shipment.  The carbonates and grey ores here have mostly been from 27 to 30% copper, and some as high as 40%.  The deeper levels have sulphuret ores.  Up to 149 workers have been employed.

Other mines referred to in the book are those of Strathalbyn, the Bremer and Kanmantoo from which silver, lead and copper have been obtained.
