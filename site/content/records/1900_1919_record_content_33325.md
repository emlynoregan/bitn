Christmas in Burra

Christmas festivities proved quite a record in Burra.  The big increase in population in the district caused by closer settlement brought quite a crowd to the town on Christmas Eve and subsequently to picnics.  Christmas morning brought special services at the Anglican, Methodist and Salvation Armey places of worship and in the afternoon a large number of residents drove to World’s End Creek Gorge [Burra Creek Gorge]

Hanson Methodists held their usual annual tea and public meeting and about 100 residents from Burra went by train to attend.  In the evening the Coronation Brass Band played in the Rotunda under the direction of Mr F. Wheatley.  On Boxing Day the Redruth Methodists, who had altered the date of their Sunday school picnic from November, enjoyed a first rate outing at Sod Hut.
