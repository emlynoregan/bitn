Ian Auhl writes in response to remarks made by E.C. Allen MP when opening the Burra Show, when he mentioned the possibility of a short term re-opening of the old Burra Mine:

While the facts given by Mr Allen are no doubt correct, there are many unanswered questions in people’s minds.  Mr Allen does not know the town well enough to realise that the short term future he envisages is in direct conflict with its long term future role as a tourist town and Australia’s oldest mining area.  If what was being offered was another Mt Isa or even a new Burra Mine there would be no doubt about the benefits, though even then some would no doubt regret the passing of the old mine area.  Bur exactly what will Burra (or SA) gain by the destruction of the old mine area and all its buildings – by the destruction of an area unique in Australia and which is Burra’s central asset as a tourist attraction?  Mt answer is, it would be exchanging its unique heritage for a mess and not for any real gain.  Among the questions that need to be answered are:

What percentage of copper does the 3.4 million tons of ore body contain?  The correct answer, I believe, is an average 1%.

How much of this 1% can be extracted by present processes?  About 60%.  So the useful part of the ore is about 0.5%.  This would be unprofitable at present, even with the high price of copper.  An efficient metallurgical process would apparently make it profitable by managing to extract another 0.25%.  We are not told what the profits of the mine would amount to, but surely they would be marginal.

Who would profit?  Mainly the shareholders of Broken Hill South of which Mines Exploration Ltd is a subsidiary company.

What would Burra get out of this?  Extra trade as the result of employing some 35 or so men.  Other benefits have not been specified.

Where would they be housed?  Perhaps in company caravans or units, as they have been for the past few years or perhaps on Housing Trust land near the Redruth Gaol.

Past experience suggests they would be single men.

Would they be Burra men?  It is not stated.

What houses would be affected?  What area of the town would the open cut affect?  What would be the length and width of the open cut?  Would it be about ¾ mile long by ¼ mile wide and 500 ft deep?

What effect would the pumping have on the Burra watertable?

Would any of the ore body be processed in Burra?  Or would it be transported 600 miles to Cobar for processing?

Is there any indication that after a maximum of ten years mining there would be any permanent benefit for Burra?

Some twelve months ago I mentioned these questions to an officer of Mines Exploration Ltd and spoke of the relative value to Burra of such a small mining venture compared with the value of the town’s long term tourist possibilities.  The answer was ‘So what?’ as if this could be of no concern to the people of Burra and was evidently of little concern to someone chasing a quick quid.

Is Mr Allen aware that the Corporation of Burra owns the mine area and the mineral rights?

What compensation is likely to be paid whether the mine opens or not?

Is Mr Allen aware that Mines Exploration Ltd used the old powder magazine for storing bags of samples and this has resulted in the cracking of the roof of this, the oldest mine building in Australia?

Does Mr Allen know the company fenced around the chief tourist attraction – Graves’ Shaft and Engine House?  Was permission sought or given for these acts?  What compensation arrangements have been made for the loss of the mining area and its buildings or for damage done?  Is the establishment of a small mining venture in the heart of a town really wanted?  Id Burra needs a boost it is already getting one from the growing tourist traffic and the value to the town of thousands of tourists will be much greater than the value of an additional 35 men or so for a maximum of ten years.  Various Governments have spent a considerable sum in exploring the mine area, but the answer is a doubtful one and of comparatively little value to Burra itself.  This apparent boost could be more of a kick in the pants than a shot in the arm.  I would like to see a public meeting to give the people of Burra a chance to express their opinions and ask their own questions on the matter of Burra’s future.
