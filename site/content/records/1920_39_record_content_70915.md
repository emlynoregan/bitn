Burra Town Council.  Last meeting before the elections.

The Under-Treasurer has given approval for the £400 loan to be spent on a swimming pool.

The Jamestown Town Clerk advises of his Council’s support for the Morgan-Whyalla pipeline to go through the Burra/Jamestown district.

Several new streetlights have been installed by the Burra Electric Supply Co. which will also supply lighting to the road sign in Market Square for £2-8-0 p.a.  Accepted.

The new Council is expected to start the year with an overdraft of c. £300, assuming £200 had been spent on the pool.

Cr Dow reported on the committee recommending the purchase of a motor truck.  He presented the case for a truck over the purchase of two horses etc. and so moved.  Seconded by Cr Robinson.

Cr Jeffery favoured horses – the truck would not be of use in roller work or making side drains or scooping or grader work.

Cr Samuel wondered about the financial aspects of it.
