Fashion Feature

A Sheep & Fashion Gala Night in March boosted Burr and its primary product.

Saltbush Clothing Co. relocated to Drew & Crewe’s Building and won an award for best small business with fewer than six employees.

Work & Western, a new business, has begun next to the Commercial Hotel, retailing work clothing and farm supplies.
