Redruth Town Crier, Alan Jewell visited Burra on 15 May.  The colourfully clothed and very vocal character visited the Goyder Council Office, where he presented Chairman Laurie Sullivan with a memento of his visit.  A return presentation was made and Alan proceeded to Morphett’s Engine House, where he was greeted by about 86 students from BCS (Reception to Year 5) and community members.  Small Cornish pasties baked especially by Waters’ Bakery were freely available to all.  Alan and his wife Lynda had been in Australia for three weeks, visiting the Glen Innes Celtic Festival in NSW and Kernewek Lowender on Yorke Peninsula.  Alan thought that events and parades in Cornwall needed a bit more colour and so some years ago he voluntarily became Town Crier.  Two years later the local Council employed him and provided his traditional costume.
