Adrian Gill responds to Terry Bull’s letter of 27 February about the National Trust meeting. He denies that his late arrival showed contempt for the meeting and was due to work commitments.  He also feels that the National Trust’s decision to launch a ‘rejuvenated’ Passport on 1 April flies in the face of the overwhelming majority of speakers at the meeting.
