Local Board of Health

The Mayor urged that pressure be kept on the Education Department to attend to the school toilets.

Cr Woollacott congratulated the Mayor on his election to the seat of Wakefield [in the House of Representatives].  He was following on from an earlier Mayor Sir Frederick Holder.  He had defeated Mr Foster (Liberal) who had given 19 years honourable service.

This and appreciation for service during the Mayorâ€™s six-year term was endorsed by Cr s Harris, Riggs, Allen & Pearce & the Town Clerk.  Cr Riggs said he had set two records: continuous six years in office and being elected six times unopposed.

[The first actually equals E.W. Crewes 1914-19, but Crewes was opposed in his first election of this period.]

The Mayor responded for himself and on behalf of his wife.
