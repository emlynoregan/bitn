‘THE NEGLECTED DISCOVERER OF THE BURRA BURRA

Gentlemen – In addition to the complaint of “Philanthropos,” published in one of your late numbers, I beg to add, that Thomas Picket [sic] petitioned the “Proprietors of the Burra Burra Mine” about three months ago, for some fair donation or a small annuity, in consideration of his discovery of the said mine.  To that petition he has not yet received any answer, although it was drawn out in the most earnest and respectful manner possible.  It not only represented the benefits that accrued to them from his discovery, but also, his own poverty and incapacity from age, hardships and debility, to support his declining years.  Notwithstanding these urgent representations, the fortunate proprietors have not deigned even to acknowledge the receipt of his communication.  Such unprecedented neglect of their patron is a crying disgrace to every shareholder of the Burra, and if they persist in paying no attention to the poor old man, I mean to furnish you with a sketch of his losses in consequence of that discovery.  The remark of everyone who knows the circumstances, is, “they ought to be ashamed of themselves.”

I am, &c.,

PHILO-PICKET
