Burra Railway Station.  The railway platform has been enclosed with a picket fence and entry to it to meet a friend or to say goodbye will be charged 3d.

‘[For] many years past numbers of young men and women have paraded the platform out of mere curiosity - it is said - to the detriment of those who wished to have egress and ingress to the carriages, a change was at last necessary.’

Now it will be necessary to make more room for cabs, as they will now stand in the main entrance, unless regulated.  More room for them and other vehicles need be made by cutting away the bank in front of the station.  Another needed change is for the stop here to be ten rather than five minutes - actually only four when the bell is rung.  The refreshment rooms are second to none, but the public are always complaining of the altogether too short stay.

‘The urinals are only open now during the arrival of passenger trains, and closed, like a prison gate, immediately on departure.’  On Saturday the Manoora footballers were provided with a carriage, but no other convenience was made and the result in the immediate neighbourhood of the closed urinals was a scene of the filthiest description.  [The footballers had arrived, of course, by a goods train.]
