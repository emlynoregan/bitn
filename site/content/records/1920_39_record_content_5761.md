Kooringa Football Club.  The wind-up meeting for 1921 season last Monday with President W.R. Chambers in the chair.  The club ended the year £19-12-10 in credit.  Membership was 25 compared with 53 last year – due to the formation of the B Grade club.  The club lost only three matches for the season and would have been premiers but for accidents befalling two players.  They regarded the program arrangements as unsatisfactory.  The medal for the most consistent went to Dave Killicoat.  £15-8-0 had been collected towards helping injured players.  Mr Allen, Hon. Sec. was voted an honorarium of £6.
