Andrew Kleinig is Burra Young Citizen of the Year for 1988.

Andrew has been a regular attender at Venturer meetings.  He has been a regular communicant at his church and a church steward.  His academic and athletic achievements are many.  He regularly is a place getter in javelin, shot put, and discus as well as being a keen swimmer and lifesaver.  In team sport he is a regular best player for the Rams Football Team.  He is particularly notable for his Scouting interests.  Andrew has successfully completed his Queenâ€™s Scout Award; the highest award in Scouting.  Andrew and another Venturer took on the extra task of assisting in the running of the local Cub Scout section when it had leadership problems.  Wherever there is a need to assist someone or do a service to another person the cheerful and friendly face of Andrew Kleinig is there, ready to give time and effort without the thought of reward or commendation.
