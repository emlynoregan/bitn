Hallett Sports on 9 November.  The threatening weather gave the day a poor start, but only a little rain fell to settle the dust and dust and wind came later.  By about 4 oâ€™clock the weather was unbearable.  Terowie easily beat Hallett at cricket.  In the evening there was a grand entertainment in the Institute, followed by dancing at 10.30.
