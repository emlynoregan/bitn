Farewell.  About 40 couples assembled at Fitzroy House, Redruth, on Monday to bid farewell to a young lady on her departure for Broken Hill.  Dancing was the main event of the evening, but a boxing saloon was set up and a number of swains entered the arena to do battle for the girls of their choice.
