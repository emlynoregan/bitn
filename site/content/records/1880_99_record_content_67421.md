Inquest into the death by burning of Mrs Wade.

Catherine Hartnett, daughter, said her mother came to assist with the washing and near the end sent her to lie down.  While she was doing so her mother’s dress caught fire and Catherine got her hands badly burned trying to put it out.

D.A. Crosby saw the deceased after the fire, said she was perfectly sober, and said to him that a stick of fire had fallen out of the copper onto her dress.  She had lived about 9 hours after the accident.

Letty Ford corroborated the comments about the cause and had wrapped the deceased in a blanket to extinguish the flames.

Dr Brummitt gave evidence relating to the extensive burns and the likelihood of severe shock as a result.

The verdict was accidental death as a result of her dress catching fire, with no blame attached to anyone.
