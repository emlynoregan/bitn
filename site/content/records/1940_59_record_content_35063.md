Burra RSL Sub-Branch held its AGM on 17 January.

President E.C. Collins reported on the year’s activity.

It was the first year for the Club in their new home, so generously provided by residents of Burra and District.

In getting this established special thanks must go to three old stalwarts, Arthur Bence, ‘Bud’ Coverdale and Tom Fuller.

The Mid North Sub Branches Annual Conference was held here in March and the Ladies’ Auxiliary did a wonderful job in catering for that.

In April the Anzac Sports were conducted well by a small committee.  Entries were down on previous events and attendance was small, but that was expected after a break of many years.  A united effort should see greater success.

Anzac Remembrance was held at the Memorial in Market Square on the Sunday after Anzac Day, followed by a church service in the evening.

Fundraising came from various sources during the year.  The second Saturday each month saw a Sub-Branch Dance.  These were well attended and grossed £61-18-3 for an outlay of £12-3-6.  Hire of the hall to others brought in £49-10-0.  Overall the year resulted in a profit of £65, but it must be remembered that a reserve must be built up for repairs and renovations.

The ladies Auxiliary is thanked for their great help through the year.
