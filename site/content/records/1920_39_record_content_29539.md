They ended the year in credit £44-17-7 after paying £121-14-8 of interest and principal half –yearly.

The Chess & Draughts Club this year had been active after a lapse of some years.

Orchestral & Choral Classes have continued and the outstanding feature was a performance of Handel’s Messiah involving 200 performers (combining with the like organisation in Clare).  Rehearsals are under way for a production of The Pirates of Penzance.

Elected were President, M.W. Bednall; Vice-President, J.H. Bryant; Secretary, E.J. Harris; Treasurer, J.H. Bryant.

Porter’s Lagoon Boat Club has improved facilities greatly with the provision of shelter-sheds with seats and tables.  The lagoon has shrunk, but is still a huge sheet of water.  The beach is clean.  We hope for a wet winter to maintain water levels.
