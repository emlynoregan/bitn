‘B.F.L.’ responds to Hardy’s letter, but with a personal attack rather than answering Hardy’s points.  He says among other things:

‘He [Hardy] writes, however, very much in the style of one who having once carried a hod cannot forgive the upper strata of society for having permitted him to do so.’

‘Who or what “Mr W.H. Hardy” may be I have not taken the trouble even to ask, though I am quite unaware of his identity, and am willing to grovel still further in the dark, so far as he is concerned.’

[It seems unlikely that the writer would indeed have been so ignorant and while Hardy later denies having carried a hod, the thrust may well be a disguised shot at his past as a chimneysweep.]
