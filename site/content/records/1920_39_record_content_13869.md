Show Society.  1 August.  Mr McBride was made a life member, particularly for his help in preparing the new showgrounds and so was Mr Bartholomæus for his donation of land to the grounds.  Dances were bringing in £4-£5 a week.  An industrial room had been erected at a cost of £216.  Fencing was completed and the finance committee will fence the ring.
