Education Board

Henry Mason wrote from White’s Forest complaining of the miserable and dilapidated condition of his schoolhouse and appealing for funds to help towards repairs.  Since the closure of the Burra Mines the people were very poor and many without employment.  Many with large families were quite unable to pay school fees.

The Board said that regrettably they had no funds for such purposes and could only suggest he appeal to gentlemen whose local interests might induce them to assist.

[White’s Forest is not known with any certainty, but Manning in Place names of South Australia, November 2006 says it was probably near Wirrabara.]
