Editorial on 1885 in Retrospect.

1885 was a year of worldwide depression.  [There was then much on European news and British Politics.]

SA was worse than the other Australian colonies because there was a coincidence of low wool, wheat and copper prices, with bad seasons as well.  As usual SA had experienced a change of Government, but the new Government:

‘ . . . as a whole has no policy and no controlling power in the house’.

They believe in protectionist tariffs and the stopping of public works just when they should have begun.

The full effect of the depression had only recently reached Burra, but the 1885-86 harvest has been very bad and had brought it home.  The only hope of revival in the short term was seen to lie in the ‘improbable . . . renewal of work at the mine’.

The editor felt that the locals were too absorbed in their personal making of money and too apathetic on public issues.  Those who should lead the community do not even subscribe to the local paper; do not place their advertising work locally.

The Wesleyan Picnic this year was at Hallett on New Year’s Day, by special train.

Cricket.  1 January at Aberdeen, Saddleworth v. Aberdeen on the ground next to Drew & Co.’s store at Aberdeen.

Special Services for New Year were reported for the Kooringa Wesleyan Sunday School and the Kooringa Bible Christian Church, where the preacher was W.G. Torr of Moonta.

St Joseph’s was packed on Christmas Eve, with a midnight sung mass.  Conductor was Mr Cater and Rev. Father O’Dowling preached.

Barrier Silver.  There was a report on ‘The Eaglehawk Silver Mining Compaox’ [sic] situated at Mt Gipp, and in which the shares were nearly all held by people at Burra.

World’s End Silver.  Silver has recently been discovered in the Robertstown-World’s End area, but too many people own claims with no intent of developing them.

James Cater, the first headmaster of Burra Public School has been promoted to East Adelaide School.  He will be missed.
