Burra High School.  Plans are in hand for a new Burra High School with building due to start in early 1973.  The Minister for Education Mr H. Hudson confirmed this on a visit to the Burra Schools on Friday.  The new school should be occupied early in 1974.  The move will allow the Primary School more room.
