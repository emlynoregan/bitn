Redruth Court, 7 April.

T. Halls v. J.E.H. Winnall for defamation of character: a claim for Â£490 damages.  The basis of the claim was that Mr Winnall on the occasion of the prosecution of Harry Mendelsohn had said that Halls ought to come into the box with clean hands.  Halls took this to mean his hands were dirty and since then some friends have shunned him over the same thing.  The charge failed on two counts: firstly the utterances of Mr Winnall in court were privileged and could not be the subject of a charge and secondly the words uttered meant that he should come into court free from reproach.  Judgement for the defendant.
