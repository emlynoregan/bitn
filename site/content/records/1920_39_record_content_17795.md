Fire at the Burra Mine

Saturday morning* at about 11 a.m. smoke was seen issuing from the top story [sic] of the small engine house close to Morphett’s Shaft and later the short grass nearby was also noticed to be alight.  Residents in the vicinity immediately beat the latter out as if it had got away into the next paddock a standing crop would have suffered.  The folk residing in the mine did not however realise that the fire was as serious as it was and never raised the alarm but tried to put it out by themselves.  Between 2 and 3 o’clock it assumed such proportions that to fight it was out of the question and soon not only the small engine house but the big one over Morphett’s Shaft was in flames.  The woodwork of enormous dimensions, burnt like matches and as there is an immense amount it took some time to burn.  Towards midnight quite a crowd had collected to watch the blazing poppets fall which supported the platform on which the big pulley wheel was fixed, used when the mine was working for drawing stuff up and down the shaft.  On this platform some 50 feet high also stood a life size figure of a miner holding a round stone hammer and chisel.†  [In the issue of the Burra Record on 23 Dec. 1925 this is corrected to a pick and miner’s gad.]  This figure has always attracted much attention and looked upon with feelings amounting to veneration by past and even the present generation of Burraites and many sincere regrets were expressed when the fire fiend having done its work it, in company with the wheel, crashed to the ground.  The wheel which measures 5 feet in diameter and at white heat broke but the figure was not badly damaged.   Morphett’s Shaft which is almost under the large engine house is 500 feet deep and heavily timbered and this is now burning fiercely. [The shaft was actually dug to 100 fathoms or 600 feet]  We understand the sight on Saturday night was very beautiful when the flames leapt to a great height.  Sunday hundreds of folk visited the spot to view the destruction.  Large columns of smoke were then ascending particularly from Morphett’s Shaft and one could hear the heavy timber falling away and crashing into the water below.  The property belongs to Messrs A.J. and P.A. McBride of Adelaide.  The matter is being investigated by the police, but it is generally alleged that the fire was caused by some lads smoking out pigeons of which a large number have lived in these old buildings.  Many old miners state that it may possibly be weeks before the fire will burn itself out.  The only thing left “intact” is the “famous echo” which is as clear as ever.  [* Given the boys’ appearance in court on 10 December this would seem to refer to 5 December rather than Saturday 12 December.]

[† See XXXXVII, 50, 23 December 1925, p.4 for a correction to this description.]

At Redruth Court on Thursday [10 December] before Messrs M.A. Radford and E.F. Marston JPs Thomas William Sedgeman; aged 13, and Hurtle C. Allen, [a few days short of 12] were charged by M-C Johns with lighting a fire for purpose of smoking out rabbits without clearing a width of seven feet around the site of the fire.  Both children pleaded guilty.

M-C Johns stated that the boys had explained to him that they went to the engine house a little distant from Morphett’s Shaft to smoke out rabbits.  They gathered some manure and lighted it away from the ground floor, covering the fire with bags to make the smoke go under the floor.  No rabbits came out and they went away.  At the mine pool they looked back and saw the fire spreading, and noticing a resident they ran away.  This was about 11.30 a.m. on Saturday.  Some of the residents saw the fire but none thought it advisable to advise the Police or Fire Brigade.  If active steps had been taken the property would have been saved.  When one of the poppet heads was alight at the bottom a man threw three buckets of water on it, but as it did not go out, did not trouble any further.

After consideration the Bench convicted the boys, they come up for sentence when called upon.
