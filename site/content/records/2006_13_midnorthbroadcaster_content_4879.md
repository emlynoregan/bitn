RAAF’s Hot Air Balloon visited Burra last Thursday.  There was a balloon demonstration at BCS on 6 March.  It is all part of the RAAF’s program to make people aware of the possibility of jobs in the service and it is an economical ad effective promotional device according to Squadron Leader Bob Cook.  Wind conditions prevented any attempt to fully inflate the balloon, though the burners were demonstrated to students.  The group visited Clare on Friday and Saturday.
