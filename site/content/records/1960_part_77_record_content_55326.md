Burra Mine Buildings Preservation Committee

A three hour meeting was held in Burra last Friday evening.  Mr H. Rich of Samin outlined what help the company could give.  He outlined what they had done at Cobar in restoration and setting up of a local museum.  He stressed the urgent need for action and outlined the time limits.  Mr Auhl was asked to report on steps taken to implement the course of action.

At a personal interview with National Trust President Mr Berry the President had offered the support of the National Trust executive.  This means an appeal can be launched by the Trust and donations will be tax deductible.

On 17 March the supervising architect Mr G. Krause and official Trust photographer Mrs Barbara Toope will make their survey of the buildings concerned.  This work is on a voluntary basis.  Mr Rich is giving access to the buildings.

Builder Mr Geoff Lloyd was prepared to undertake the demolition and reconstruction on a cost plus basis.  He is a master builder recommended by Mr K. Gill of the Master Builders Association.  He knows the Burra buildings well and will co-operate with all voluntary help that can lower costs.

The Master Builders Association has recommended the engagement by Mr Lloyd of a Danish steeplejack now resident in SA and he and Mr Lloyd will visit Burra in the next fortnight to assess methods of demolition and reconstruction.

The Committee then considered other matters:

Access to site

Priorities 1 & 2 Peacock’s Chimney and Graves’ Pump House.  Priority 3 Peacock’s Pump House was not thought tenable.  Stone from here would be needed by Samin for repairs to the Powder Magazine and by builders to replace stone in other buildings.

The site offered by Mr G. O’Connor near the Mine entrance was accepted as appropriate and would give Burra a complete Cornish Unit of a chimney and Pump House in an appropriate area.  Also the area could then become malineable [sic: but not found in OED.] as the property of the National Trust.

Publicity.  Much free publicity seems on present indications to be available in the media.  It is clear that with the all round help being given, the scheme has moved, within a few weeks, from possible to probable and now to certainty.
