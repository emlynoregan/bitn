Accident.  Another car has overturned on the Burra-Black Springs Road.  Last Thursday morning Mr L. McL. Wright, an Adelaide solicitor, turned his car over near the Black Springs Church, when his brakes grabbed on a corner.  He was not hurt and the car, which rolled onto its side, could be driven on to Burra when set on its wheels again.
