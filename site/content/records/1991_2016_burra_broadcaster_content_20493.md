Burra Music Students celebrated the end of the year on Friday night with over 75 family and friends at a concert at the Burra Camping Centre, followed by a barbecue tea.  This had been a tradition for many years, but had been missed for the last couple.  Students of four music teachers attended: Judy Giles, Mark Greenshields, Heidi Nicholson and Cathryn Peppiatt.
