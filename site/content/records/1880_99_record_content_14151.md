James Henderson jun.	Thomas Price

Archibald Ker		William Hopkins

Patrick Lally		Samuel Barnett

Were each charged with insulting behaviour in that they threw eggs at passengers and each other at Drew’s Corner in Market Square on 2 August.

Price, Ker and Hopkins pleaded guilty and Henderson, Lally and Barnett not guilty.

F-C Radford gave evidence of damage to Miss Morgan’s dress and that one egg landed on Mr Drew’s daughter’s jacket.  He saw Henderson, Barnett & Price run away and heard Henderson say ‘I gave him one right on the back of the head.’

He did not actually see the eggs thrown.  There were the remains of about five eggs on Drew’s verandah and several more between there and Symon’s butcher shop.

All the boys were discharged with a severe caution.
