Anzac Services were held in the Salvation Army Citadel and in the Redruth and Kooringa Methodist Churches.  At Redruth all the solo songs at an ‘after church’ musical service, were given by returned soldiers: G. Tiddy, R.P. Pollard & D.L. van Senden.  Dr D.M. Steele gave an address on tuberculosis and appealed for funds for the Tubercular Soldiers at Bedford Park.  £8-7-0 was collected and £7 from the Kooringa service.
