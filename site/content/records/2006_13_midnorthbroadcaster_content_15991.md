Goyder Council has slashed entry fees for its swimming pools for this season.  Community feedback suggested high fees last season reduced pool use.  Fees have fallen from $4.50 for adults and $3.50 per child for each session to $2 per person with no concessions or monthly tickets.  The Council has more than $1 million invested in upgrading the Burra & Eudunda pools and is seeking to encourage public usage.  The opening of the refurbished Eudunda Pool will be delayed to 8 December to enable finishing touches to be completed.  Relocation of the plant room and the discovery of a significant leak around the pool plug were major factors in the delay.  [Page six then immediately goes on to say both pools will be open this weekend!]

[The charges and operating times etc. are summarised on page 6.]
