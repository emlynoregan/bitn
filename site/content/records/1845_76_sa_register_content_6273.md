Police Court, Kooringa 12 May before W. Lang Esq. Resident Magistrate.

Tom Porter was committed to prison for failing to pay a fine of £5 for assaulting Dr Bull.

[Corrected in the Register of 5 June to a fine of £1.]

Margaret Watson, who appeared with a pair of black eyes, was charged with being drunk and disorderly on the Sabbath.  She pleaded guilty and His Worship dismissed the charge with a severe reprimand after she promised to be more orderly and abstemious.
