Obituary.  Mrs Ada Maria Strong died at her son’s residence at Burra North on 6 February.  She was born at Bimbowrie Station in the northeast of SA on 12 April 1863.  Her parents were the late Mr & Mrs E.B. Gare.  While she was young the family lived at several places, including Happy Valley. Later they farmed at Banbury, Mt Bryan East and later at Whitfield, which is also at Mt Bryan East, and while there she married Mr James Thomas in 1890 and they lived near Caroona Station and in 1901 purchased ‘Wallinga’ Mt Bryan East, where they lived for 20 years.  They retired to ‘Northfield’ Burra North until her husband died in 1935.  She later married Mr A.H. Strong and lived at Burra North and later Highgate where Mr Strong died two years ago.  Just after Christmas she came to Burra for a holiday and was unable to return home.  She took a keen interest in the Methodist Church and the Burra Benevolent Society.  She is survived by three sons: G.R. & F.G. Thomas of Burra and A.L. Thomas of Terowie.  There are eight grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.  She is also survived by five brothers: Edward Gare (Seacliff), Wesley and William Gare (Burra), Lewis and Stanley Gare (Adelaide) and one sister, Florrie Mrs Hunkin (Unley.)  [Married Arthur Hamlyn Strong, a widower, in 1936.]
