H. Morgan writes in response to the Smith’s Weekly story on Mongolata.  H. Byles did not discover the gold at Mongolata.  His pegs were practically in the same place as those put out by the late Ted Bywaters years before and he duly registered his claim and the holes in which he obtained gold were only a few yards from the present shaft.  Almost everyone had heard ‘Old Teddy’ talk about the gold he had been getting since 1924.

The editor also points out that Mr Byles was a station manager and not a boundary rider as the Smith’s Weekly article stated.
