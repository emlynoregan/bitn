Obituary.  Dudley Armstrong, second son of Mr & Mrs H.V. Armstrong, died last week in an air accident.  Mr Armstrong was once in charge of the Burra Police Station and Dudley spent most of his childhood in the town.  He was a clever boy who did well at Burra High School and later joined a banking institution before he joined the RAAF and became a bomb-aimer.

[Horace Dudley Armstrong was born 23 January 1925 at Peterborough.  The SA Deaths CD is in error in citing the death date as 20 April 1943.  The age cited is consistent with a death 20 April 1944 at Kappawanta Station, residence Nuriootpa.  See also 64, 19, 9 May 1944, page 1.]
