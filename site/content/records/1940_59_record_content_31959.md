The Burra Racing Club’s meeting last Thursday was one of its most successful, despite a number of hurdles in arranging the event.

When the SAR advised it could not send a special train on the planned Wednesday, the day was moved to Thursday.  Then at the last minute the railways advised they could not supply a special train.  A special bus service was hastily arranged.  The publican’s booth was let, but the publican called off the deal shortly before the event.  [This appears to be due to difficulties in obtaining beer, because he agreed to come if the organisers could get the necessary liquid.  Somehow they were able to do so and he took on the job.]  No tenders were received for the luncheon booth and this was finally run successfully by Messrs Beames & R.C. Lott of Burra who do not usually engage in catering.

The course was in fine shape, though on the day the fair weather was somewhat marred by a strong wind.  Last year the bookmakers handled c. £18,000 and it is thought that this year the sum was about £25,750.  With only a few minor problems, the events were handled smoothly.

There were seven events.  The main event was the Burra Handicap: 1st £75, 2nd £15 and 3rd £10.  Run over 1¼ miles and won by ‘Golden Wheel’.  [Other results are printed.]
