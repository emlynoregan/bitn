Burra Co. MR.  After the inspection on Wednesday there will be a social in the Burra Hotel.  Fall-in is at 2 p.m. in Market Square.

Wool is arriving at the Burra Station – so far from Oakvale and Caroona.

T.F. Robertson has come forward as a replacement for Cr Linkson: nominations close on Monday.

Burra Homing Club race from Petersburg on Wednesday last was a failure with none of the birds getting home in the time limit.  Mr Crewes’ Britisher was attacked by a hawk on the way and came home on Thursday night with a torn crop, but he seems to be recovering.

The Salvation Army Demonstration coinciding with the Burra Show was a great success.  There was a meeting at the Showgrounds followed by a well patronised tea.  The evening meeting was also well attended.  The demonstration realised about £22.  The Barracks were opened on 15 April 1885 and cost c. £700, most of which has been paid off.
