Obituary.  Percy Carey of Booborowie died 8 November from shocking burns received the previous Sunday at Andrews.  He was a most popular resident of Booborowie.  After sustaining the injury he drove his own car to Mr Thorntonâ€™s and maintained his usual cheeriness, but the injuries were such that there was never any hope of recovery.  He was 38 and leaves a wife, and a young son and daughter.
