‘An Old Experienced Miner’ writes on the subject of Grants or Leases for Mineral Lands.

In my travels I have conversed with sheep and stock farmers, miners, shepherds and labourers of various kinds.  They have often revealed that they know of mineral discoveries, but have not revealed them because they had no hope of benefiting from it.  The land would have to be surveyed and sold and would inevitably fall into the hands of either speculators or mining companies.  They would not reveal sites of minerals until they could be sure of being paid for the discovery or getting a share in the venture.  The advantage is always in favour of the rich over the explorer or discoverer.  Speculators or developers are willing to give a trifle to the discoverer, but only in the event that they become the purchasers.

If leasing were an option the first step of the miner and speculator would be to ascertain the locality of the deposit and a vast number of sites would be pointed out in order to ascertain which to work on.  In order to decide this there would be an incentive to pay the discoverers either in money or in shares.

There are three types of indications for mineral lands:

Places with but slight indications.  Under present law miners argue that much trouble and expense would be incurred before a decision to mine would be justified.  These indications will be passed by as not worth the expense under present law.  A lease would enable these indications to be tested and some would go ahead either at once or at a later date when perhaps other opinions or conditions prevail.

The second type of sites have indications of fair quality exist, but not so rich as to be of much value.  Areas of the Murray Scrub where there are known deposits of copper at 5% would be an example.  Leases would enable these places to be worked, abandoned and work resumed as circumstances change.

The last type of site has rich ore, but the discoverer is afraid that if he discloses it and applies for a survey and has the place put up for sale, the price will be run up beyond his means to purchase.  The discoverer will not reveal such sites until he can see how he will benefit.

The Government would benefit by the opening of promising mines now lying dormant.  Their development would in turn lead to the demand for agricultural development around them and demand for labourers etc.  Objections from graziers that they would be disadvantaged by leases could be managed by some forms of compensation.  [The writer gives an example.]
