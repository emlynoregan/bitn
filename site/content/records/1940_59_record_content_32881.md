Obituary.  Mr Harold Doyle, a farmer of Mt Bryan East was killed in an accident on Tuesday last week.  He was driving a tractor up a steep creek bank when it apparently got out of control somehow.  Mr Doyle seems to have leapt from the machine and fell on a large rock in the bottom of the creek.  When he did not reach home his wife asked Mr E.S. Wilks to make a search and he found the body about 8.15 p.m.  M-C Wiech of Burra North investigated and reported to Mr F.M. Jefferies JP of Mt Bryan who deemed an inquest unnecessary.  [Harold Colin Doyle born 12 November 1914 Redruth: died 12 August 1947 Mt Bryan East.]
