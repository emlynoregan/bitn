Editorial: - Possible Industries for Burra.

The editor suggests a clothing factory and a soap and candle factory - both making use of the local sheep products. Plenty of local fat was being wasted. Tanning was another possibility and machinery.  The latter was represented in a small way, but could be expanded and could include traps and other vehicles.
