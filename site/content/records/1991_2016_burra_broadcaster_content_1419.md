Burra 150 Jubilee Committee is preparing a program of events for 1995 and wishes to involve as many local clubs and organisations as wish to participate in some way during that year.  Each club is asked to pass on to the Committee Co-ordinator Leonie Fretwell via the Council Office, details of office bearers with whom they can liaise.
