Obituary.  Mr E. (Ted) Bywaters, the alleged finder of gold at Mongolata, died at Burra Hospital on Monday.  He lived at Mongolata and was found by an employee of Mr P.V. Oates at his hut on Sunday in a very bad state.  Mr Oates contacted M-Cs Robinson & Boyce and the sick man was taken to the hospital where he rallied briefly, but died the following day.  Although a prospector for many years he is believed never to have come across a decent ‘find’ and is believed to have been in poor circumstances at the time of his death.

[Edward Bywaters died 21 May 1934, Kooringa, residence Mongolata aged 76.]
