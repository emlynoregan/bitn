Editorial on Our Railway System

On Tuesday the line to Orroroo was opened.  Now almost all the land within the 10‚Äù rainfall line has been taken up and railways extended through it.  How are the railways calculated to serve the country and what extensions are demanded and to what end?

Mt Gambier and surrounding lines are in good country and capable of extensive expansion with connection to Victorian lines.

The Nairne line is to be connected to the Pt Victor and Milang lines and ultimately become the intercolonial link.

The Great Northern and North Western System with the main line to Farina [to continue to Hergott Springs] with a western branch to Pt Pirie and from Hamley Bridge to Blyth and Kadina with connections from Roseworthy to Morgan and with Port Adelaide.

The first two systems we look complacently at.  They will accomplish their aims and extension with profit is possible.  The third system however, shows terrible uncertainty as to routes, gauges and purpose - a result of its piecemeal accumulation.  The gauge problem will have to be resolved at great cost at some time and yet both continue to be built.  In country like ours, which is generally fairly flat the savings on the narrow gauge are really a trifle.  The Jamestown-Petersburg line serves neither the area straight across to Ulooloo or Yarcowie, nor goes far enough north to serve the extensive areas near Orroroo.  Much thought is needed for any extensions, but the following lines are worthy of consideration.

Blyth-Crystal Brook

Gladstone-Wirrabara

Eudunda or Burra-Eastern Plains

Terowie or Petersburg-The Barrier

Nairne-Victoria

The transcontinental Line [i.e. to Pt Darwin]
