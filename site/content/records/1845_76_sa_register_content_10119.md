Kooringa News

The Primitive Methodist Church was reopened last Sunday.  Three sermons were preached by Rev. J.D. Whittaker of Adelaide.  Collections totalled £27.  On Monday more than 600 attended a tea-meeting.  Captain William Michael chaired the public meeting.  The profits of the tea-meeting were £32-13-4 and collections at the public meeting raised £10.  Total expenditure had been £502-5-8½ and income was £362-6-3½, leaving a debt of £139-19-5 on the chapel.  The chapel has a neat appearance and will seat 300.  Captain Roach has presented a magnificent Bible to the chapel.

Gardens in Kooringa.  Some fine vegetables have been cut from Mr Varcoe’s garden, including some broccoli weighing from 10-12 lb.  On Saturday some fine cauliflowers were sent into the township from Captain Isaac Killicoat’s garden.  He has a garden of 13 acres at Abberton Park.  One of the cauliflowers weighed 42 lb and was 51 inches high with the diameter of the flower 13 inches.  The diameter of the top leaves was 40 inches and of the stalk 11 inches.  The survey for the railway from the Burra to the Murray runs through the garden.
