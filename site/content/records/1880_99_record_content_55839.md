Bible Christian Church.  Last Sunday Dr Torr visited and preached two excellent sermons.  The church was filled to capacity for the first time in some years.  Dr Torr came first to Burra with his parents when he was aged two and was educated here, first under A.H. Forder of Redruth and then under N.D. Bennett & F.R. White.  He was Secretary of the Bible Christian Sunday school and the Band of Hope for several years.  At 16 he left Burra to take charge of the Stanley Grammar School, but ill health forced him to Tasmania for three years.  In 1873 he returned and started a school at Ulooloo and three years later went to Grote St Model School for training as a teacher.  He subsequently took charge of Moonta Mines Model School with upwards of 1,000 students.  Three years later in 1885 he was offered the position of Principal of Way College.  He then studied for five years at Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin Universities, obtaining his MA, BCL at Oxford, a BA at Cambridge and LLD at Dublin.  He was called to the bar and is a barrister of Inner Temple, London.  He returned to SA and took charge of Way College with c. 500 pupils.
