Accident & Obituary.  On 20 December J.L. Cleary of Hallett and Max Pearce, local manager of Elder, Smith & Co. were driving to Booborowie when they collided with a car driven by Mr Tom Warnes, youngest son of I.J. Warnes of ‘Wahroonga’.

Both survivors were taken home, but later to Burra Hospital.  There will be an inquest in the New Year.
