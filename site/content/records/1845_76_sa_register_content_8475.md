Central Road Board.  Burra-Port Wakefield Road

A letter from the Colonial secretary stated that the Governor had appropriated Â£500 from the Land Fund for work on the Burra-Port Wakefield Road and requested the Board to superintend the work.  Mr Giles said they would do no such thing and would leave the Government to superintend its own roads.

The Secretary reminded the Board they had earlier passed a resolution, stating that they would supervise such works if the Government would supply the necessary money.  Resolved that the Secretary write to the Patent Copper Company to ascertain what arrangements they were willing to make for the superintendence of the works.
