Obituary.  Mrs Webster who died 28 March had been a resident of the district for about 34 years.  She was formerly Elizabeth Steadman Cadzow and was born at Linlithgowshire, Fauld House, Scotland 23 March 1852 and came to SA with her parents on the Eastern Empire when she was 10.  On its return voyage the ship vanished without a trace.  After school she entered domestic service in Pt Lincoln and later in Adelaide.  When her parents took land at Mannanarie in 1875 she returned to help them until marrying Henry Webster of Armagh, Clare in 1886.  The couple took land at Yacka and then moved to Wandearah where they farmed till 1904.  Mr Webster then acquired part of Shafton when it was cut up.  He died in 1926.  Mrs Webster has been an invalid after breaking a leg some time ago.  She leaves three sons and a daughter: J.M.S. Webster, H. Webster, Crawford Webster of Shafton & Mrs Gladys Williamson of Adelaide.  There are several grandchildren.
