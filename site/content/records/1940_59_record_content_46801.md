The Board has approved new rules, which have yet to be approved and so cannot operate this year.  They allow for subscribers and ratepayers to elect three members to the Board.  Womenâ€™s Organisations are to elect one, the Chief MO will be a member and seven will be elected by the rate-contributing Councils.
