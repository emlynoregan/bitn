Bob Fuss brought into the office recently a shark’s tooth found with other fossils in excavations near the River Murray.  It is about 1½” long by ¾” wide with serrated edges.  He says others much larger have been found.  [He was engaged as a carpenter in form work associated with concrete structures in connection with the Morgan-Whyalla Pipeline, so this tooth probably came from Morgan.]
