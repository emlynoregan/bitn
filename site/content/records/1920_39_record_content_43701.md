Burra Show was a great success on 26 October.  The weather was good until 3 p.m. when light showers arrived and spoilt it for those in and watching the ring events.  Entries in most sections exceeded earlier years.  The special railcar from Adelaide was better patronised than for some years.  Attendance was up on 1931 as were gate takings.  Results occupy much of page 1 and most of page 4.

[Personal interest: R. Fuss was a steward in the Flower section and received prizes for:

Nasturtiums, 3 each of 3 shades	1st

Verbenas, 3 each of 6 shades	1st

Verbenas, 3 each of 3 shades	1st

Verbenas, 3 of 1 shade		2nd]
