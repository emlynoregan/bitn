One of the attractions will be the visit of an historic Dehavilland DH 84 Dragon VH-AQU.

These aircraft were used by virtually all Australiaâ€™s pioneer airlines.  This one was built in Australia in the early years of WWII and used by the RAAF as a training aircraft.  After the war it served as a Royal Flying Doctor Aircraft.  It is one of only three of its type still flying in the world and has just been used in the re-make of the film A Town Like Alice.  On Sunday it will be on display in Market Square.  [Photo]
