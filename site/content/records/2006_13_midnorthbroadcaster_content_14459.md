Senator Nick Xenophon spoke at a packed public forum at the Burra Town Hall on Thursday night.  He urged the Goyder Council to seek ‘top shelf’ advice regarding wind farm development in the region.  Several people relayed their concerns about ill health effects of wind turbines.  The Senator said that Council should be supporting the community by getting independent legal advice on their rights to take on the SA Government and get independent testing done.  Three Councillor including Mayor Mattey were present and Mr Mattey said ‘Council’s main objections are the changes made by the State Government to change the developments from Category 3 to Category 2 projects and ‘the inability on any non-owning landholders to make submissions to the DAP.’  With Senator Xenophon were Victorian Democratic Labour Senator John Madigan and SA Senator Alex Carracher and also acoustician Steven Cooper.  Mr Cooper explained that the noise that troubles is not high pitched frequencies, but infrasound; low level thumping that penetrates the walls of a home.  Varying pressure is also a problem.  The proposed Stony Gap wind farm would be only 4.5 km from Burra.
