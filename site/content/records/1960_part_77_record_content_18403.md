Burra Carols by Candlelight raised £120 for Freedom From Hunger.  It was held at the War Memorial Oval on 22 December.  Attendance was c. 750.  5AD Radio compere Charles Norton was MC and R.V. Mueller led the Burra & District Choral Society.  After 9.30 p.m. gusty winds and a few spots of rain slightly marred the otherwise very successful occasion.  The Mayor Mr Baulderstone donated the soft drinks’ profit to the cause and he also delivered his Christmas message.  Mrs Odgers of the Catholic Church suggested the idea and the Methodist and Anglican Churches eagerly responded.  Father Hughes, Rector Drought and Rev. Jenner worked together on the planning committee.  The Mayor made the point that this coming together of Catholic and Protestant effort was a significant point in the town’s history.  The combined choir had been practising for some weeks under the High School Headmaster Mr Mueller.
