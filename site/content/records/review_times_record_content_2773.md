Football.  The Burra Football Club has agreed to amalgamate with the Booborowie-Hallett Club if certain conditions are met.  70% of members attending a special meeting on 27 November agreed to the move.  This was a complete reversal of an earlier decision in November.  This was probably due to the new conditions specified.  Burra asked that all games be played at Burra and the name of the amalgamated club be Burra-Booborowie-Hallett rather than North-East Districts.  Both the existing clubs believed they would struggle to field teams in all divisions in the future.  The number of juniors was expected to drop dramatically in the 1990s.  Currently there were only 80 senior male students at BCS.  The amalgamation would reduce the number of team places from 160 to 80.  The amalgamation would lead to a stronger club and would strengthen the very successful Burra Sports and Community Club.  Booborowie-Hallett would now consider the proposal with the new conditions.  If amalgamation proceeded Burra Football Club would not immediately disband, but would instead go into recess for two years.
