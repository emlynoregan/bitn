Weather.  It was fine and balmy till Sunday.  Many went out for a drive on Sunday, but the fortunate few noticed the gathering clouds and headed for home by 3.30 p.m.  A deluge of 180 points stranded 17 picnickers at G.B. Morgan’s near Mongolata when the Douglas and Baldina Creeks came down.  The eastern mail was due in Burra at 6 p.m. Sunday, but did not arrive till 10.45 Monday.

At World’s End between 3 & 4 p.m. 3 inches fell in less than an hour accompanied by hail in sizes from a pea to a marble.  As late as Monday 10 a.m. tens of thousands of tons of ice still lay around in places 18” deep.  Hedley McWaters said in places water cut tracks through the hail leaving banks of ice 18” high.  T. Heinrich brought a compacted block into Burra on Monday at midday.  At Mr Duell’s old home 280 points were registered – a mile away F.J. Duldig registered 4 points.  The storm track is reckoned about 20 miles long and 5-6 miles wide.

To the north Mt Bryan recorded 104 points, Hallett 120 and Mt Cone 180.

The Burra Creek came down about 20 yards wide north of Aberdeen.

In Burra on Sunday 39 points fell and 112 since last Wednesday.
