The Burra Jinker – a reprint of an article by R.J. (Bob Noye) (16 July 1932 to 17 August 2002.)

The transporting of Schneider’s pumping engine to the Burra Mine was a great achievement for a colony less than 20 years old.  The engine arrived at Pt Adelaide on the Joseph Weir in April 1851 and was loaded onto the jimker that had been especially built in Adelaide.  The Cornish boilers were brought to the mine in sections and erected on the spot.  Bullock driver Bell Freeman was given the task of transporting the cylinder, which had a bore of almost seven feet and weighed 8 tons.  He started in January 1852 with a team of 72 bullocks – six abreast at the face of the jinker, ten in the next rank and then gradually decreasing to the leading pair.  The few bridges on the way were shored up to prevent damage and covered with a layer of sand to reduce vibration.  The bullocks were unhitched and taken across the bridge and then reassembled the other side.  The jinker was then hauled across with ropes.
