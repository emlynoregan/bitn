24 October 1873, page 3

Kooringa.  Many shearers are daily passing through the town at the end of the shearing season.

S. Drew & Co. have accepted tenders for the construction of a large wholesale store near the railway station.  They and others are anticipating changes due to the extension of the railway.  Drewâ€™s store will be capable of holding 3,400 tons of goods.  A public house and various other buildings, it is understood, are also to be erected close to the same place.  The new brewery [in Kooringa] is nearing completion.
