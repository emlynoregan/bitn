Fire.  A fire broke out on Saturday afternoon near Cavandale (the estate of the late Mr J.P. Malcolm) between Clare and Farrell Flat.  About £8,000 damage was done to bagged wheat, crops, fences, stock and grassland.  Eventually the fire was stopped by Salt Creek entering Porter’s Lagoon near C.W. Neill’s property.  The fire travelled extremely fast and firefighters attempting to burn breaks were almost caught in the blaze.  Luckily the fire was stopped before it entered the Koonoona property or it would have run for many more miles.  Koonoona is given over to grassland and there are neither firebreaks nor well used roads to act as breaks.  It is thought the fire started from a backfiring truck.  Although no human lives were lost, Mrs C.W. Neill had to carry her 18 month old twin sons to a fallow paddock and take refuge in a car when the fire burnt to within fifty yards of her home.  Mrs Clive Atkins took similar action with her baby son.  The smoke could be seen for 25 miles and smoke clouds rolled into Burra township sometime after the fire was out.

Losses included:

Leo Abbott – much grass and fencing.

G.L. Klemm – 100 tons of hay, a shed, a chaff cutter and a number of pigs.

Clive Neill – 100 acres of standing crop, 100 bags of wheat, much fencing and several sheep.

H.C. Atkins – 70 acres of standing crop and 550 bags of wheat.

J.M. O’Connor – oats, wheat and standing crop and fencing.

Leo Abbott & Miss Abbott – some 6-7 miles of fencing, a few sheep, feed and stubble.

Several other farmers suffered minor losses.
