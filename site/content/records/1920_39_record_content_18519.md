YMCA.  There is a proposal to renovate the Scout Hall and to add some furniture.  A trained YMCA worker would come regularly from Peterborough (headquarters for the YMCA in the north) to guide and assist work here.  At Peterborough a major aim is to provide a 31-bed hostel for young men working there.

The Mayor, Mr Collins has promised a liberal gift and Mr James Reed also promised a generous donation and at once made the Boy Scout’s Hall available.
