Pte Bob Burns writes from London County War Hospital.  He tells of arriving at the hospital 30 June, unable to speak or hear and almost lifeless.  He has only limited use of his right arm and suffers memory loss.  Since then he has gradually improved.  He had been blown up by a 190 lb shell 4’6” long and 15” wide.
