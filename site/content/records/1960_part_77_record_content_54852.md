Peacock’s Chimney and Pump House to be re-erected on the mine hill where they would be visible from the by-pass

Grave’s Pump House to be re-erected at the old Mine entrance close to the Burra-Burra North Road.

An architect and contractor I consulted both see these position as suitable.

6.	Little finance would be needed to this stage.

7.	These are state heritage items so finance should not be just a local issue.

8.	A building contractor has suggested re-erection costs should be considerably less than $10,000 per building, given free architectural services and help from Samin in demolition.

9.	This money does not have to be found immediately.

10.	Sources of Funding:

The Government has accepted some of the moral responsibility for the future of the buildings and could contribute something each financial year.

The National Trust, both Burra and Adelaide.

Public subscription – making this via the National Trust would make donations tax deductible.

Burra Burra DC – I cannot believe, despite the article in last week’s Record that they would contribute nothing.

Tourist grant.

Re-erection as funds permit.  The contractor has consented to give a detailed estimate.  This broad outline only comes from five years’ involvement with the town I love and is aimed at one thing only; the preservation of the Burra Mine buildings.  I am willing to come to Burra at any time with the architect, building contractor and others who are offering help.
