Burra Town Council met on 12 February to discuss the amalgamation with the District Council.  Most Councillors felt that the loss of town status and of the leadership of a Mayor and Mayoress would be an important deciding factor.  The expression of the ratepayers who signed the petition, giving reasons for the amalgamation would be sought.  It was felt much more discussion between the two Councils would be needed before the actual facts for and against any amalgamation could be laid before the ratepayers.  The Mayor protested against the long delay in repairing the footpath in front of his home; it having been ripped up by a Government Department and now has been sealed at his own expense.  He also objected to pine trees cut down and dumped along Mr Brian Riggsâ€™ fence that should have been removed months ago.  The Town Council resolved to meet fortnightly instead of monthly, on the first and third Mondays of the month.
