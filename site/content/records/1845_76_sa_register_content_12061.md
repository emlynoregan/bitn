Kooringa News, 1 December

The weather has been very changeable.  On Saturday last there was a violent thunderstorm, which flooded the creeks and carried away the dirt, which is generally lying about.  No damage was done.

The Colonial Directors of the Bon Accord Mine visited their property this week and inspected the various workings.

Mr Woollacott set out from Burra on Tuesday 30 November to fetch the big engine for Schneiderâ€™s new shaft accompanied by a few friends bearing flags to show their kind feelings towards his great undertaking.
