A separate Sheep Show was held in September and was a success.

The annual show was on 27 October and was an unqualified success.  For the first time the cattle yards were well filled.

The horse jumping was very good.

We started the year in credit £27-15-10 and end in credit £75-15-0.

The Pastoralists’ Committee of the Royal Agricultural Soc. in Adelaide has now decided on a separate sheep show and this will no doubt be adopted.  They have a new shed for sheep exhibits 323’ x 90’ and will challenge Burra’s pre-eminence.

Election: Patron, Hon. John Lewis; President, I.J. Warnes; Vice Presidents, T. McWaters & A. McDonald.

The Syndicate is to be approached about the lease of the grounds.  It is believed that the rent will be £3-3-0, but perhaps the new shed would be offset against this.  The secretary of the Syndicate will be asked to convene a meeting.
