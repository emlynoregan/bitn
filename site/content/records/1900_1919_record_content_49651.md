Henry John Rutter, acting postmaster, gave evidence of receiving 17 letters from Dale and marking them and then going to the room and finding 44 further letters.  The postmarks on the letters were from 20 January to 5 February.

Rosa Pearce, owner of the boarding house, had discovered the letters while cleaning.

The accused admitted destroying other letters and opening some containing cheques, money orders etc.  He made a statement saying he wanted to resign in October, but his mother wouldnâ€™t let him.  He was 19 on 5 October 1916.  He opened about 50 letters and burnt the contents.  Over the last six months he had destroyed about 20 letters a week.

He was committed to the Supreme Court for trial.
