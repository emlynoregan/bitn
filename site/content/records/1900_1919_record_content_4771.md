Rev. W.F. James writes concerning the recent election for North Ward.  On 26 November he received a letter form W.H. Hardy soliciting his support in the election, to which he made no reply.

[The text of Hardy’s letter is printed.]

On 3 December he received a second letter from Hardy:

‘I beg to congratulate you on your untiring efforts in re recent municipal elections for North Ward, and thank you accordingly, your success I am sure being worthy of your task.

I am, sir, etc.  W.H. Hardy.’

This was such a sarcastic tone that Rev. James demanded an apology, failing which he would publish both of Hardy’s letters.

There was a defiant response dated 5 December 1901 instead of an apology and so Rev. James sends Hardy’s letters for publication.  He explains that in fact he asked no one to support either candidate in the election.
