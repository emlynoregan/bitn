Silver Wedding.  Mr & Mrs E. Gebhardt of Sarnia near Naracoorte celebrate the 25th anniversary of their marriage.  Mr Gebhardt arrived in Australia in 1858, but married Miss S. Gassmann in Duderstand, Hanover, in 1883, returning to Australia the following year.  He spent much of his time in the Burra District and the couple returned to farm there, but moved to Naracoorte about seven years ago.  They have six sons and a daughter ranging from 22 to 7 years of age.  Mr Gebhardt is a brother of the late G.A. Gebhardt of Mackerode and of Charles Gebhardt of Burra.
