Burra RSL held its AGM on Saturday 20 February.  Only 26 members attended.  Elected: President, G.J. Kelly; Vice-Presidents, T. Rogers & E.C. Pietsch; Secretary, R.W. Fullgrabe and Treasurer, Ron Wuttke.

President E.C. Pietsch reported on a successful year with a farewell visit by the Governor Sir Robert George, a successful Annual Smoke Social and Ball and two lectures.  The Anzac day Service was conducted by the Ministers’ Fraternal and the Port Pirie Pipers’ Band led the march.  The Christmas Party was combined with the Air Force Association.  Successful Badge Days were held for Legacy, Poppy Day and Anzac Day Appeals.  Two Legacy wards have been maintained and £81-4-0 collected in a weekend bottle drive for this cause – a similar drive was conducted last weekend.  The front of the clubrooms has been painted without charge for labour by Messrs J. Kelly, E.C. Jones and R. Day.  Farewells were tendered to T. Brazil and Colin Morrison, who had been an able Secretary in the past year.  Bob Ford died during the year and was provided with a funeral escort.  The Ladies’ Auxiliary was thanked for their valued help.
