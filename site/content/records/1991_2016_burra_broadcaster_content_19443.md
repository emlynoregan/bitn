Swimming Pools

Goyder Council has recently done a study of the three pools it owns at Burra Eudunda and Hallett.

The Eudunda pool and wading pool is the oldest.

The Burra pool and wading pool is less than ten years old and is at BCS under a joint use agreement with the Education Department, though this agreement, which involves the transfer of the land to the Council, has not been signed, despite repeated attempts to do so.  Council has now sought the aid of Hon. Graham Gunn MP to have this done.

Hallett pool is less than ten years old and shares toilets, a power supply and bore, which is located on Hallett Primary School grounds, under an agreement that is no longer in effect since the closure of the school and the Council should seek an agreement with the owner, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources.  It was so moved at the last Council meeting and also that the existing Eudunda ablutions and change room structure be replaced by 30 June 2004 and that an ablution and change room structure be built by that date at Burra to allow that pool to act as an independent structure by 30 June 2004.  Council is currently formalising a lease of the Eudunda Pool to the Eudunda Amateur Swimming Club Inc.  The report recommends this type of arrangement be made with the other pools by 30 June 2000.
