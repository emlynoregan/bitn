Mothers & Babies’ Health Association.  Lady Bonython opened the new clinic on 27 April.  The building required a further £270 to be free of debt.  Lady Bonython is State President of the M & BHA.  Upon arrival she was entertained at luncheon at the Kooringa Hotel.  The Mayor Mr E.T. Baulderstone attended the opening, despite being the only male present.  Local Association President Mrs R.B. Jennison welcomed the visitor and called on Lady Bonython to open the door.  It is seven years since clinic services opened in Burra and the number of mothers and babies using the service has increased every year.  Mrs Jennison said she could not mention the individual names of the many who had helped, but she did single out Mr Baulderstone who made the Mayor’s Parlour available for the clinic and Mr [R.] Fuss, without whose help, advice and labour it would have been practically impossible to open the building.  The aid of the CWA has also been greatly appreciated, along with the husbands of the committee members.  The M & BHA now has 84 buildings.  It had started in 1909, when it was called ‘The School for Mothers’.  It was started by Dr Helen Mayo with some helpers because she was appalled at the infant mortality rate, which was then over 70 per 1,000 births.  Last year it was 18.67.
