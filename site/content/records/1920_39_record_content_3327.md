Burra Hospital Board, 4 February

A letter from Dr Ashton of 6 January acknowledged receipt of the Boardâ€™s letter of 23 December, which he says gave no indication that the position referred to is not the one he had applied for, but a new one.  He asks for details of the duties and privileges appertaining to the new position.

The Secretary read the following suggestions from Dr Steele in answer to the above:

Privileges:

The right to send to hospital and there treat his own patients.

The right to charge patient fees once the patient has discharged the hospital account.

The right to use the operating theatre with the use of hospital staff.

Duties:

To give such anaesthetics as required by the MO of the hospital.

To give anaesthetics to indigent patients in an honorary capacity.

To consult with the MO when required and in indigent cases to do so in an honorary capacity.

Dr Steele has the same privileges, but as there can be only one MO (following instructions from the Chief Secretary) he will be responsible for general medical management and for the treatment of the indigent patients and for instructions to nurses.
