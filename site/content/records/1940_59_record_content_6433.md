Country Empty Houses

Many people have drifted from the country to the city, leaving empty houses in the country and creating a list of thousands in the city seeking accommodation.  Many have gone to the city for work essential to the war effort, but many already in the city could surely just as easily reside in the country.  The Minister of Industry and Employment is therefore seeking to get a list of vacant houses in country areas to which people whose presence in the city is not essential could be moved, so opening up accommodation there for those doing work for the war effort.

The information sought is to be sent to the Chairman, Unemployment Relief Council, Adelaide.
