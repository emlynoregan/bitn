Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting, Wednesday 20 November

Only 30-40 attended.  The fact that those seeking election were returned unopposed may have contributed.  Stan Kellaway took the chair.

The Mayor read his report.  He explained the double crossing to be made from the stockyards to the railway at the request of and with the assistance of the stock firms.  It would save damage to lambs estimated at 1/- each or more.

Mr Lynch thought electricity charges were exorbitant.  The Mayor said with Council approval he would approach the company on the matter.  The Council itself got a concession of £25 [on street lighting].  He said he knew that lighting costs in the city on his own property there were one third of the Burra costs.

Cr Button retired from the platform and incoming Councillor Graham H. Dow took a seat on the platform.

The Mayor thanked the ratepayers for their confidence in electing him Mayor for the third year in succession, making eleven years on the Council.  He would do his best for the unemployed.  The assessment and rates had been reduced.  The water supply to East Ward had been improved.  A deputation to the Commissioner of Public Works had finally succeeded following a fire near Paradise at which the water supply was manifestly inadequate.  Another deputation got a good supply of fresh water for Mongolata.  132 chains of new pipe had been laid in Kingston and Commercial Streets and water laid on to the saleyards and the whole water main system re-organised and renewed.  This work was nearing completion.  Every effort had been made to find productive work for the unemployed.  They had also got £50 from the Government on a £ for £ basis for Christmas Relief.  £200 was got for the main road from the railway to the north boundary under the Relief Act and on 29 November £20 was granted to level a [playing] ground at the Burra School.

The 1929-30 assessment was £17,611 with a 2/6 rate to raise £2,201-17-6.

The 1930-31 assessment was £17,081 with a 2/3 rate to raise £1,1922 [sic: error for £1,922.]

The present assessment was £14,524 which at a 2/3 rate would raise £1,631-5-0.

Money for the wards had fallen also:	1929-30	£1,261

1930-31	£600

1931-32	£450

The year had started in debit £108 and ended with a debit of c. £20.

This proved they had not been spending money recklessly.  He thought the rate should be reduced by 2d or 3d, as rents, properties and wages had all dropped to the levels of 15 years ago.  Farm debts remained a huge problem and the depression was not yet over.

He was surprised Cr Button had taken any notice of the ‘Guttersnipe’ press for alleging the Council was [Party] political.  If sending congratulations to P. McBride and C.A.S. Hawker, old Burra boys, on their election was deemed political then they had misunderstood a courteous action.  Numerous wires had been sent to the Premier and other Ministers, but other Councils had also done so.  Cr Button’s letter to The Record is misleading.

He also referred to the 70th wedding anniversary the previous day of Mr & Mrs Sam Baker of Redruth who were splendid pioneers, now 93 years old.

Cr Bevan thanked ratepayers for electing him unopposed.  He said about the recent controversy in the paper, that someone whom he thought the President of the RSA had rung and disassociated himself from Mr Carne’s sentiments and Cr Jennison had given him his support and offered to sign his nomination paper.  He was for cutting expenses, but not as far as Council employees were concerned.  He thought the Hospital rating a bit heavy.  Byles’ Mongolata Mining had said when the battery was working they would employ 50 men and that time was near.

Cr Riggs did not favour further reduction in rates, as the £150 for North Ward was little enough to maintain the roads there.  Ratepayers needed to remember that the Burra Electric Supply Co. was a private company and it was not the Council’s business to interfere with them.

Cr Dow said the figure in the Mayor’s income and expenditure account didn’t balance by £59.  The Mayor said that the Town Clerk could explain.  A voice said it was a printer’s error.

Mr Button asked whether the Mayor knew that the ‘Guttersnipe’ press he referred to was The Country News, the official farmers’ organ.  The Mayor said he based his remarks on what he read in The Record.

[But see the paper of 14 December where the editor of The Country News denies any reference to the Burra Town Council.]

Mr Haese said at present in town was an expert on trees and planting in the person of Mr Tom Wilkinson, a son of Charles Wilkinson, who might give some good advice to Council.

The Mayor said advice had been obtained and some trees had been lopped at the wrong time.

The Mayor said the Council’s levy of £180 to the Hospital was controlled by the Inspector-General of hospitals and not locally.

A.G. Carne asked if the Mayor would support enlarging the rotunda – it held about 14 and the band numbered 26.  Mr Murison had a scheme for doing so at little cost.  Crs Bevan and Jennison were in favour.

Mr Button asked why East Ward Councillors had not been approached.
