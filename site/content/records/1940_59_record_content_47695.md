Burra Burra DC

A letter was received from G.S. Hawker MP about the response of the Minister of Local Government on the Black Springs Road.

The new route, which deviates at Black Springs to come via Hanson, has been purchased to avoid railway crossings etc.  The Black Springs to Hanson section will need considerable work before bituminous construction can be carried out.

Approval was granted to prepare streets of Hanson, Farrell Flat & Mt Bryan for seeling with bitumen at a later date.

Authority to do the same in Booborowie was deferred.

The limited funds in the Main Roads Grant for 1950-51 make it unlikely any of this work can be done for some time.
