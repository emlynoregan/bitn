Hallett Railway. A meeting was held at Hallett to oppose the extension of the railway to Yongala. The mood was that the break of gauge should be at Hallett and produce north of Hallett should go to Port Pine and south of it to Port Adelaide. 
The feeling at Pt Pine was for a narrow gauge line Hallett to Jamestown. The extension of the broad gauge from Hallett should be to Broken Hill via Yarcowie, Terowie, Gumbowie, & Mannahill. 
Some thought that these two views were contradictory, but others thought not. There was also a proposal for a break of gauge junction at a place 16 miles from Jamestown to the north of Hallett. 
Resolved: the break of gauge should be Hallett 
Moved that the broad gauge go to Broken Hill via Yarcowie, Terowie and Mannahill. 
Amendment 1 to reaffirm first resolution. 
Amendment 2 that the Govt connect Jamestown and Hallett via Yarcowie on narrow gauge 
Amendment 1 carried. 
After some further discussion both amendments were set aside. 
The resolution was then lost. 
The second amendment above was then put as a motion. 
Amendment: The Jamestown line be extended to Yarcowie, there to meet the broad gauge line extended from Hallett. Amendment lost and motion carried.
