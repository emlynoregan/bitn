St Andrew’s Anglican Church at Mt Bryan held services on Sunday to celebrate its Golden Jubilee. Rural Dean of Clare Rev. S.M. Smith and Rev. G.D. Sibly of Burra officiated.  A lych-gate has been erected as part of the beautification of the grounds.  [The newly erected Lych-gate is pictured.]  The land for the church was given by W.A. Gebhardt.  He and Mr H.L. Hatherly were the first Wardens of the Church.  The foundation stone was laid and dedication services were conducted by the Broughton Archdeacon Bussell.  The building and furniture cost £650 and the debt of £150 was paid off on 4 February 1921.  The consecration was not carried out till 1933.  This was the second church built in the parish.  (The Black Springs Church was purchased from the Methodists.)  There are two stained glass windows in the Sanctuary.*  One is in memory of Andrew Barker Hooper, who died 28 November 1914.  The altar cross and candlesticks were given by the UNREADABLE Family at Eudunda.  The Sanctuary hangings and altar linen were made and given by Mrs Bloyd (the wife of the Parish Rector in 1915) and Mrs Hatherly.  Several items of furniture have since been added: pews in 1960.  It has twice been renovated; in 1935 at a cost of £95 and in 1958-59 at a cost of £375.  Pine trees planted in the grounds are in memory of parishioners who went to WWI.  The lych-gate and stone path were added in 1964.  The Church is past of the Parish of Burra, which is in the Arch-Deaconry of the Broughton, within the Diocese of Adelaide.  It is anticipated that the Deanery of Broughton will be ceded to strengthen the Diocese of Willochra in 1966.  Present Wardens are G.S. Hawker, People’s Warden from 1949 and M. Collins, Priest’s Warden from 1960.  Rectors of Burra Since St Andrew’s was built have been:

S.J. Bloyd	1910-18	(With F.H. Durford as Assistant Curate in 1915)

F.B. Hewitson	1921-27
