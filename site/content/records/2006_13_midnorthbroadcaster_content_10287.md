Accident.  Police and emergency services attended an accident last Sunday night at the intersection of the Barrier Highway and Copperhouse road southwest of Burra.  It is alleged that a Holden sedan with two passengers failed to give way at the intersection and collided with a four-wheel drive with three occupants.  The 4WD rolled several times and passengers in the Holden had to be cut from the vehicle and were taken to Clare by ambulance.  A female passenger was seriously injured and was air lifted to Adelaide.  A dog with seven pups was thrown from the Holden and two of the pups had to be destroyed due to their injuries.
