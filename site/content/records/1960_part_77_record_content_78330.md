Burra Burra Show Inc. held its AGM on 8 March.

Elected: President, R.J. Shipard; Vice-Presidents, N. Hurst & P. Stockman and Secretary-Treasurer, D.H. Field.

The previous year had been very successful socially and financially.  The floor of the confectionary and pet sections had been cemented.  Weed control is being worked upon.  The 1975 show was well attended despite poor weather.  Insurance covered the loss in attendance money.  In the coming year in conjunction with the Pony Club it is intended to enlarge and top dress the show ring.  Rural Youth will work on general repairs to the Main Hall.  The Scouts have asked permission to erect a storage shed.
