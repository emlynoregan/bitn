Kooringa Money Orders

The changes to the money order system at Kooringa have been introduced with minimum fuss.  There was some small difficulty in procuring sufficient gold and silver until the small orders of the Burra Mining Company were issued.

Business Hours.  We are glad to see moves among the assistant drapers and grocers at Burra to reduce the present long hours of business.  We also applaud the disposition of employers to support the young men in this matter.

Resident Magistrate’s Court

There has been little action due to the indisposition of Mr Lang.

Sergeant McCulloch charged Stephen Johnson, butcher, with shooting bullocks in the stockyard at Kooringa and he was fined 5/- when brought before G. Bull Esq.

J.W. Powell, chemist of Kooringa, reports that a letter from England tells that a fellow named Lamas, formerly of the SA Mounted Police, has been pretending knowledge and friendship of settlers to gain access to certain families at home.  Not only has he done so, but he has also then slandered the colonists by reporting to their friends or family false reports of their behaviour.  He represented Mr Powell as having taken to drinking and gambling.

‘A Householder’ writes from Kooringa 4 May to complain about the small number of police at Kooringa.  There are only six police in the town.  Only the previous night there had been four robberies from stores, with only on man apprehended.  Such robberies the writer says are a daily occurrence.  At least six more police are required.

‘I need scarcely add that, through intimidation, most of these vagabonds escape punishment; the tradesmen fear being mobbed if they prosecute any of these cutthroats.’
