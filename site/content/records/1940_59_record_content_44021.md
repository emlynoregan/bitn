Obituary.  Mrs Mary Marston died at Calvary Hospital in Adelaide on Friday last week.  The death was unexpected, as she was apparently recovering from an illness.  She was a daughter of the late Philip Lane and was born in Burra 29 September 72 years ago.  She was an active worker in patriotic causes in the 1914-18 war and for 25 years was Secretary of the Burra Red Cross branch.  In December 1919 she married Ernest F. Marston who died two years ago.

[Born Mary Lane 29 September 1877 Kooringa: died 6 January 1950 North Adelaide, residence Burra.]
