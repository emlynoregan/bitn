J.C. Killicoat writes from Cheltenham explaining that the term ‘Drill Order’ meant rifles, side arms, belts, bandoliers etc., which it is now unlawful to possess.  He had advised the term ‘riders be in uniform’ would have been alright.  He regrets that some members saw fit to cut the event out and hopes they will reconsider.
