Kooringa Methodist Sunday School picnic which had been postponed due to lack of rain was held at Gum Creek Station on Saturday last by kind permission of H.F. Saunders, manager.  A good outing was had by all and use of the roomy shearersâ€™ quarters with fires lit and water boiling by Mr Saunders was greatly appreciated.
