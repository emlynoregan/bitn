Publicly Examined Leaving & Matriculation

The Hon. M.B. Cameron asked a question in Parliament about what could be done to change the situation where employers were not recognising internally assessed courses to the detriment of many students.  The Hon. T.M. Casey in reply acknowledged the difficulty and suggested there would soon be a committee established to investigate alternatives to the PEB Leaving and Matriculation examinations.  The alternative would put every student more or less on an equal footing, removing the distinction between internal and externally examined certificates.
