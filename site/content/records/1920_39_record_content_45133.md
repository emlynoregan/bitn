Mongolata Goldfield

The battery is working well and will be officially opened tomorrow.  Mr I.J. Warnes as Chairman of the Mt Bryan District Council issued invitations and acknowledgements of their coming have been received from Hon. R.S. Richards Premier of SA, District Members Messrs McHugh, George & Critchley, the Mayors and Councillors of the Burra Corporation and the Chairmen and Councillors of several District Councils.

Byles’ Mongolata GM will be open for inspection tomorrow.  On their return to Burra the Ministerial party will be entertained at a dinner at the Burra Hotel by the Mayor and will later have a civic reception at the Burra Institute after which the Premier will speak.  Byles’ Mongolata GM had ore treated last week and 50 tons 14 cwt yielded 52oz 19dwt 12gr; considered highly satisfactory.

Treatment of Villis & Co.’s ore was begun on Monday and we understand Wildildie comes next.

After the recent display of free gold from Pexton’s Takati claim last Wednesday saw the display of another lot from the Curlew Holding of Messrs Villis, Motherall, Morgan & Schwier.

Before Pexton & Sons held Takati we understand it to have been held by Albert H. Moore Sen. of Kooringa, Mr John Barker & Mr E. Thredgold, but development work was too much, as they also hold the adjoining claim.  Previous to Moore taking it over it was held by Messrs Fairchild, Bowey, Stewart etc.

Block 8.  Sinking of the top shaft continues to 61ft with a leader showing in the shaft.  All ore now bagged is booked for crushing.
