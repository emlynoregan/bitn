Porter’s Lagoon will be the site for an Aquatic Spectacular on 22 February, sponsored by the Gilbert Valley Lions Club.  The Club’s money-raising this year is principally aimed at making a significant contribution to the provision of an Orthopaedic Workshop at the new Crippled Children’s Centre at Regency Park.  This will design and make all manner of clothing and aids to make affected persons more mobile.  The club is supporting Mrs Denise Benger of Saddleworth in the Miss Personality Quest.
