Telstra has two new CDMA mobile phone towers at Mintaro and Booborowie.  Barry Wakelin MP for Grey launched the service on 16 July.  The $564,000 project would greatly boost reception across a wide area.  A tower at Hamley Bridge was already in service and towers at Saddleworth, Snowtown and Mallala would be up by August.
