Redruth Court, 9 August

Arthur Harold Harrison [known as Mick] was charged on 8 August at Hogback Station.  He was in illegal possession of the skin of a lamb and 18 pieces of its carcass.  His father, John Harrison, was charged with aiding and abetting.

George Ralph Thomas, part owner of the station, gave evidence of going to the defendants’ rabbiting camp on the station with an employee, Sydney Fidge, where they found the skin.

Sydney G. Fidge corroborated.

Sergeant Johns gave evidence that the defendant John Harris had said the meat had come out with Bill Kakoschke from the Burra butcher’s on Saturday week when he brought Arthur out.  When confronted with the lambskin he had claimed it to be an accidental killing when ‘Mick’ was aiming at a kangaroo about 15 miles away on Alderman’s Station.  On going to the site alleged we found the lamb’s head, trotters and ‘the pluck’.

M-C Hornibrook corroborated.

A.H. Harrison made an unsworn statement giving more detail of the shooting and the butchering of the carcass.

John Harrison made a similar statement on oath.

Sergeant Johns said this evidence amounted to a confession and concealment and retaining were not justified even in the event of an accidental killing.  ‘Mick’ had a previous £5 fine for unlawful possession.

The sentence was six months in Adelaide jail.

A.H. Harrison was further charged with breaking and entering Burra Military Depot and stealing a rifle and overcoat valued at £12 – someone having done so between February and April and the rifle having been found in the prisoner’s effects.  The hearing was adjourned for a fortnight.
