Central Board of Health Inspection has found that the Local Board was running things efficiently and the scavenger to be doing a good job with the rubbish tip well located and maintained.

The main cause for concern is the number of cesspits in the town – with c. 450 houses cesspits are numerous.  There are many wells, but the chief water supply is from the Bon Accord Mine well.

Another problem is the boiling down of tainted bones etc. in ordinary coppers in populous parts of the town at two of the butchering establishments.  The Health Act requires this be done using the best possible means to counter the offensive fumes.  This is not the case here.

The girls’ cesspit at the school should be emptied during the holidays and the boys’ urinal is in need of attention.

Pigsties at the Bon Accord Hotel need paving and a drainage receptacle for the urinal provided.

The cleanliness at R. Austin’s butchering premises should be improved and all slaughterhouses should reduce the amount of tainted fat around them.
