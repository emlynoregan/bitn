Burra Town Council

The Hydraulic Engineer’s Office has offered to supply a hydrant etc. for £5.  If a fire brigade were formed 24 hours notice of a wet practice would have to be given to the fitter in charge who must attend the same and be paid by Council.  When a fire occurred the mains could be tapped without notice.  When the last fire occurred the covering on one fireplug was damaged.  The Mayor said the most ridiculous part of the whole affair was the taking of the hydrant to Adelaide.  Had the fire last Friday got a hold half the town might have burnt down although the Council had procured everything else to fight the fire.  ‘Had it not been too late he would have telegraphed to the Department asking them to return the hydrant with permission to use the water.  The terms of the letter will be complied with and a hydrant procured.  The approximate cost of a fire reel is £7-10-0 and S. Burns offer to make on was accepted.
