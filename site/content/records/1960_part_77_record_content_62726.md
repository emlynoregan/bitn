Burra Football Club Cabaret drew a big crowd with over $700 taken at the door.  A final profit of over $300 is expected.

Paxton Square Cottages have received a grant of $5,000 under the Rural Unemployment Scheme.  The fronts will be whitewashed, then new guttering and if finance permits the painting of the roof.  Four men are working on this project and eight others are employed under the scheme in putting down cement kerbing and water tables elsewhere.

A.L. Clode & Sons’ new funeral parlour is nearing completion.

Jennison’s Showroom Extensions are progressing.

Burra Burra DC.  The extensions at the Council Office have begun.

Peacock’s Chimney.  The work has been hampered by high winds and rain.
