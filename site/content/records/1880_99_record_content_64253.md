‘Democrat’ The third article by this writer against the Federation Bill.

Here he is concerned with the inequalities inherent in the way the structure of the Senate gives each founding state equal numbers of senators.

He is also against the retention of the royal prerogatives: especially the power to veto legislation.  He is also against the allowing of restrictions on the franchise.
