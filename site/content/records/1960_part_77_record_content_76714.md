Burra Golf Club

The new clubhouse was opened on Sunday when about 300 people attended in fine weather.  A large field of 116 players took part in Foursomes prior to the ceremony.  Mr Baulderstone welcomed visitors and said the services of the SA Gold Association Architect Mr Murray Crafter were obtained for the design of the new course opened at the start of the 1873 season.  Attention then turned to tree planting and the building of the new clubhouse.  The club is indebted to the District Council for the site levelling and road work.  Congratulations were extended to D.T. Jacka & Co.  for producing such a fine building.  Thanks also went to Associate members for their helpfulness throughout the year.  Mr Claude Allen MP said a few congratulatory words and Mr W. Brown as Chairman of the District Council opened the clubhouse.  The State Government had made a grant of $12,300 and the Savings Bank of SA had given a loan of $9,000 repayable by the club and the club had contributed $4,000 and a great deal of time in planning and much voluntary labour.  A lavish afternoon tea followed.
