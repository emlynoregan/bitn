Burra Waterworks.

The boiler has been thoroughly repaired and the cost has been something like £254 in the last two years.  A deputation was proposed to the Commissioner of Public Works to ask that he allow one year’s interest (£162) towards the cost.  It was proposed to do this when he visited with the recent Water Commission, but unforseen circumstances prevented this.
