W.H. Linkson & Josh. Blott write on behalf of the committee organising the dances in Thames St, objecting to the paper’s designation of them as a ‘larrikins’ ball’ and asserting that the dances are carried out in a thoroughly respectable and unobjectionable style.  They challenge the production of names of those involved and say the tree destruction must have occurred after the dance was over.
