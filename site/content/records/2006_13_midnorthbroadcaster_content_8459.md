Burra 100 Cycling Classic

There was perfect weather for the 68 riders and 29 juniors who took part in the 103rd anniversary of the Norwood Cycling Club’s annual two day event.  Several events were contested with the main event being the 100 km run to Mt Bryan with several laps around the outskirts of Burra.  This year’s winner was Clare rider Will Dickerson.  The event brought some 230 athletes and their friends and families to the town.  The Regional council of Goyder’s Sponsors Trophy, which was introduced in 2002 in gratitude for the Burra businesses and residents who support the event, was won this year by the Burra Motor Inn.  After the presentation of prizes Cr Peter Reilly hosted a barbecue at the Burra Showgrounds for club members.  [Photo of the race in Burra streets.]
