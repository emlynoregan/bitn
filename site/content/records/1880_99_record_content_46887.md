Blacklegs.  On Thursday night a special train carrying a large number of blacklegs arrived at Burra a few minutes after the Broken Hill express.  As its passage was widely known a large group assembled to glimpse them.  Mr Rumball, the stationmaster, wisely cleared the platform before its arrival, which prevented at least a large amount of barracking.  One of the windows of a carriage was broken by a stone as the train crossed the Bon Accord crossing.
