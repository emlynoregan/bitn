Advertisement.  Light Arms Inn, half way between Bagot’s Mine and the Burra.

This house commands extensive feed all round and the never failing water supply has already secured a flourishing trade.

WILLIAM DONNELLY, Proprietor, has spared neither trouble nor expense to make a house of superior accommodation and a table replenished with every variety that can be procured.
