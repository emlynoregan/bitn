Arrest of Baker the Horse Stealer

On Thursday 16 August Baker was acquitted in the Supreme Court on two charges of stealing horses.  Immediately after his acquittal he went to the stables of R. George at the tear of the Napoleon Bonaparte Hotel and being unknown to the ostler there, he was able to hire a horse, saddle and bridle to ride to the Bay.  He did not return.  On this charge he has now been arrested a considerable distance up the Murray on the Sydney side by Police-trooper McKenzie, who passed by Overland Corner with his prisoner on Thursday.

[John Baker subsequently achieved notoriety as a bushranger: see 20 October 1871, page 5 and later episodes of his story.]
