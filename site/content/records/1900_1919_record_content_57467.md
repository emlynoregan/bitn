Obituary.  Thomas Haskard died at Prospect.  He was born at Barkstone in England 9 April 1858 [sic]* and arrived in SA in the Mary Shephard 18 April 1865.  He was a blacksmith and machinist in Burra before going to Clare in 1875 and about 9 years ago went to live in Adelaide.  He is survived by five sons and three daughters: Messrs J. Haskard (Broken Hill), J. Haskard (Jamestown), Gregory Haskard (Victor Harbor), A. Haskard (Crystal Brook), R.H. Haskard (Torrensville) â€“ who was severely wounded at Gallipoli, Mrs Newman (Broken Hill), Mrs Ashby (Booleroo Centre) & Mrs Stockman (Hyde Park).  There are 31 grandchildren and 9 great grandchildren.  He was a member of the Burra Burra Lodge of Oddfellows for 52 years.  Mrs Haskard, his widow was illiterate until the present war started and taught herself to read and write at the age of 80.

[* Given the age of his wife his birth date above seems likely to be an error, perhaps by 20 years and  BISA gives birth 9 April 1838 at Barkestone Leicestershire  (Barkestone-le-Vale?).  Registration gives death 29 October 1918 Goodwood.]
