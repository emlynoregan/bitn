'Gluepot Reserve' formerly Gluepot Station, was opened by the Governor, Sir Eric Neal on 18 August.  It has been purchased by Birds Australia and will provide a safe haven for birds of the area.  Studies have found six quite rare native birds there – mallee fowl, striated grass wrens, black eared miners, scarlet chested parrots and red-lored whistler.

The Warnes family had a long association with Gluepot and that continues today, with Les & Nan Warnes being two of the 2,000 who have contributed towards the purchase.  Les’s father bought Gluepot in 1935 and sold it in 1962.  It comprises c. 198 square miles.  After 1962 it has had various owners, before being acquired by Birds Australia.  The house has been upgraded, the shearers’ quarters improved and there are plans for a small camping area with facilities.
