Mongolata Sports were held on Eight Hours Day 10 October on grounds lent by Mr G.B. Morgan and the success owed much to the hard work of the secretary Mr Bill Carpenter and his band of assistants who worked hard in preparing the grounds.  Trees and stumps had to be removed and temporary structures erected etc.  The day concluded with a dance in the Oddfellows Hall Aberdeen.  The results of the sporting events are printed.
