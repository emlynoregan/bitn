‘Our public service is becoming tainted with this spirit.’

R.W.M. goes on to be concerned that the professions as well as Government service will be swamped by men who will not be influenced by considerations of honourable conduct and professional tradition if we allow only education and academic merit to dictate who is admitted.  If the Government could educate the masses and give them good jobs it would still be absurd to pay them ‘wealth equal to that of the more opulent classes because they would lack the refinement and dignity of character the outcome of a life of ease and intellectual culture.’

The dangers of ‘gratuitous State education’ are palpable.  The years of compulsion should stop at 11 as those who can afford to pay are taking advantage of the present system to age 13.  After 11 full cost recovery fees are needed.  Only the most exceptionally talented children should be encouraged with state aid beyond 11.

[To be continued]  [All in all a very conservative document.]
