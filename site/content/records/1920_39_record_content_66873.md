Mongolata Goldfield

Byles’ Mongolata GM Co. reports very erratic values in sinking the main shaft.  The Director of Mines Dr Ward inspected it at 269ft with an inspector and they reported favourably.

Further sinking will await the arrival of proper machinery.  The Mines Department will supply two air compressors and a hauling winch etc. at nominal rent.  It will also pay half the cost of erecting poppet heads etc. to enable the field to be tested at depth.  A further contribution has been required from shareholders.

In the last 12 months 968 tons went to the battery yielding 185oz 16dwt 11gr for a gross return of £1,388 and a nett £1,065.  The machinery arrived at Burra Station last week.
