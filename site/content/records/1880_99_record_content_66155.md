Hon. W.B. Rounsevell:

The Government had held the balance of power for six years and had abused it y expending money without Parliamentary sanction.  The past actions of Labor had been that of destruction and the future ones would be of ruin.  They wanted to tax all but themselves.  They would raise exemptions on income tax to exclude themselves and increase it on others, would reduce duties on necessities, but make it up from land, would reduce the hours of work and yet increase pay.  Labor was for state insurance â€“ or rather state folly.  The Early Closing and Factory Bills were bad for employers and worse for the employed.  By reducing qualifications for the Legislative Council they were taking the first steps towards abolition.  Labor, he said, had practically ruled the colony for six years, yet all that had happened had not improved the position of the worker.  He was for water conservation and the promotion of agriculture, was for Roseworthy College and Federation.  He favoured the capitation grant which Mr Mitchell opposed.
