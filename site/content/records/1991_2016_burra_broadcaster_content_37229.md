Former Commercial Hotel Stables

This building was under threat of demolition, but Danny O’Bryan has renovated it and converted it to a residence with a mezzanine floor and a balcony over the footpath.  Mr O’Bryan also obtained some extra land behind to make the site a practical proposition for a small residence.  He made extensive use of recycled timber and retained some of the old cobblestone floor.  Goyder Council Heritage Officer, John Brak, praised Mr O’Bryan’s efforts.
