Des Woolley has discovered a passage describing the Burra area in the journal of explorer Edward John Eyre, which reads: ‘To the eastward, this valley was skirted by bare hills rising in elevation towards the north, until they constituted a very high and singular succession of broken hills, wholly without any timber.’

There have often been suggestions that Burra must have been timbered in the early days, but here we have a credible eye witness account from the pre-mining days, saying that it was not.
