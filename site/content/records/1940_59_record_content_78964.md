St Catherine’s Anglican Church, Hallett

The new church was consecrated by the Bishop of Adelaide Rt Rev. T.T. Reed, who was on his first visit to the district as a Bishop.  Despite a bitterly cold wind, rain and snow at least 120 people attended, of whom only about 80-85 could fit inside while the others sheltered in cars.  Among those present were the architects Messrs Cheeseman & Brownell and the builder Mr R. Emery, all of Adelaide.  The new altar of silver ash with maple backings was given by Mrs Woodgate of Booborowie in memory of her late husband Mr Brassey H. Woodgate, a former lay reader of Hallett.  A luncheon followed in the RSL Hall.  The whole congregation was able to be accommodated for evensong, which was conducted by Rev. L.R. Lenthall of Burra assisted by the Rector of Riverton.
