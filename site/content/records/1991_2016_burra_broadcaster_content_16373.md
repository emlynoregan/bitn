Burra & Districts Tourism Association is keen to produce a coloured brochure on Burra and to see better signage in the town.  They are also interested in the idea of a Merino Museum and will have another look at the Market Square redevelopment plan.  There are a couple of ideas in the town at present.  One is a gourmet food duo comprising Pauline McPharlin of Saffron Downs and Grace Delaney, formerly of Pickett’s Restaurant, acting as ‘A Taste of Burra’.  The market occupying some of the vacant shops is another idea.
