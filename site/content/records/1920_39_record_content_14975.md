Burra Hospital Board, 2 February

A petition from ratepayers in the Hundreds of Bright, Bundey & Apoinga asked for them to be transferred to the district of the Eudunda Hospital.

The chairman thought there may be some justification in the case of Bundey & Bright, but the Board decided to oppose any move to alter the district arrangement.

The arrangement for the Government subsidy is most unsatisfactory.

[The report does not make it clear how the Government was calculating its contribution. It had originally said it would subsidise council contributions 30/- in the £, but was actually paying much less than that.  The Councils were assessed at £1,196 for which the theoretical Government subsidy was £1,794. The estimate cited suggested the Government would deliver only £1,200.]

A major problem was that the Government would not send its money for some months and when the Hospital ran on a bank overdraft the Government would not pay a subsidy on that.  The Government’s response was that the subsidy was promised only if there were sufficient in the estimates.  The Government knows what income is expected from Councils and should be able to put that amount on the estimates at the beginning of the year.  It is impossible to manage the finances without knowing what money is available.

Matron Johnson put in her resignation and asked for immediate release.
