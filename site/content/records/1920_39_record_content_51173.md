Obituary.  Mrs F.R. Wigley died at her residence at Brighton at midday Saturday.  She was the eldest daughter (MaryYoung) of Mrs & the late William Pitt Barker of Baldina Station and had spent most of her life in the district, having only recently gone to live at her summer residence on account of her health.  After marrying Mr Wigley she lived for many years on their property ‘Carraca’ near Leighton.  She took a keen and practical interest in both St Mary’s at Burra and St Edmund’s at Booborowie.  She was for many years closely identified with the local Red Cross Circle, being at times President, Vice-President and secretary and was a liberal supporter of the cause.  She was also closely associated with the Liberal Federation and assisted in almost any object of a philanthropic nature.  She is survived by a husband, two sisters, Miss Muriel Barker & Mrs Whitlock-Jones (Adelaide) and one brother Mr John R. Barker (Baldina).

[Born Mary Young Barker 12 April 1876 at St John’s Wood SA: died 2 June 1934 at Brighton SA.]
