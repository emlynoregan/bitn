The Burra History Group is interested in collecting photographs of Burra and the surrounding district and is calling on people to lend their photos for digital copying.  Photographs once copied will be returned.  They are particularly interested in photos of WWI soldiers at present [with the centenary of the war rapidly approaching] and any photos can be left at the Town Hall between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.
