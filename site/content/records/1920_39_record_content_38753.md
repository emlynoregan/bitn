Mr Jim Phillips and his son Len have been cutting pine posts for K.C. Sandland in the mine paddocks of Koo-owie.  They were camped at Mann’s Hut.  Mr Phillips encountered a Jersey bull, but was saved by a fence.  He was joined by Len and they headed for the homestead along the fence, but in the dark they got lost and entered J. Eckert’s paddock where Mr Eckert’s Jersey bull, which has a bad reputation, forced them to spend the night in a pine tree where Mr Eckert found them after a vigil of about 15 hours.  Mr Phillips endured the bitter night without a coat as he had been wood-cutting.  It took three charges of shot to convince the bull to clear off.
