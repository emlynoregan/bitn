There was a ratepayers’ meeting at Booborowie to discuss a bitumen road from Booborowie to Farrell’s Flat.  The cost of a bitumen road in country areas would be £15 a mile to ratepayers.

A. Woodgate, P.N. Collins and S. Cordon spoke in favour of a road to Andrews railway siding.  F. Hogan supported the Farrell Flat route and some others thought the best option was a Peterborough to Euromina road.  Various points were made by T.J. Canny, A.D. McDonald MP, P. Kilderry and P. Carmody.  [There does not seem to have been any consensus and no outcome is alluded to.]
