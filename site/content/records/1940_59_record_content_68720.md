The standard of shooting was good at either end of the year, but fell off in the middle.  The Baldina Trophy was keenly contested.  It was won by Tom Heinrich with Cec. Edwards second.  The Marksman’s Trophy was not such a good contest, in that it resulted in a runaway win to Jim Schwier with Cec. Edwards in second place.  ‘Jock’ Bernhardt won the Club Championship with a brilliant 99 out of 100 off the gun in the final stage.  Ken Heinrich won the handicap aggregate.  In the Lower North Teams Contest, Burra recorded losses against Tanunda, Auburn and Gawler, but did better in the triangular match with Clare and Auburn, fired at Clare.  It won this match by 50 points.  In the Champion of Champions match fired at Burra on Labour Day Cec. Edwards won the 5 guinea trophy.
