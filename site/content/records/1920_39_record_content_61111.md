Koomooloo Station, last Tuesday

A historic event took place last Tuesday when celebrations marked Edwin Forrest and Josiah Rosewall’s fifty years as shearers.  The gathering included I.J. Warnes, Rex Warnes, A.E. Hamilton (Examiner in the School of Mines), Mr A.G. Fenner (of Elder, Smith & Co., also Examiner), S. Clifford (of Goldsbrough, Mort & Co.), A.H. Codrington (School of Mines), R.M. Reed (of Wandillah), Mr George Tee and Mr Rosewall Jun.

Mr George Tee said he had long experience of shearing and that Mr Rosewall and Mr Forrest were the two smartest shearers he had come across and he called on Mr Warnes to present each with a pipe to commemorate their 50 years of shearing.

Mr Warnes said he was only too glad to do as suggested after so many years association.  Mr Forrest had shorn up to 180 a day and was the ringer, whilst Rosewall had touched 153 and had been boss shearer for many years and could still do 100 a day, recently at Sturt Vale he had been the best man on the board.  Forrest had year in and year out put in a big tally.  He (Warnes) had known the Rosewall family all his life and always highly respected them.  Rosewall had turned his hand to any honest labour; well-sinking, mining, fencing and had never failed his boss.  Both men had reared families practically by shearing and had done a good job of it.  He was now employing Rosewall and son and believed he would soon have his son’s son.  His (Warnes) idea was to continue blade shearing, but he needed the support of the men.

Mr Rex Warnes added his congratulations and Mrs Rex Warnes presented each of the men with an inscribed gold watch and chain.

The recipients made brief, but warm responses.
