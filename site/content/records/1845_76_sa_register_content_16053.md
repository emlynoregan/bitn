Tothill’s Creek News

In the past two weeks not only were all the mail conveyances and Opie’s busses crowded with miners from the Burra, but a large number of other drays and wagons were, and still are, conveying miners and their families and luggage to the Kapunda railway terminus, whence their passage is provided for to Newcastle.  I hear that 200 men are already engaged and that engagements for 300 more are open.  This wholesale departure of labouring men cannot be looked upon with much pleasure.
