Kooringa News, 9 September

Obituary.  John Benjamin, died [in Kooringa] on 1 September aged 39.  Despite the stormy day the shops were closed on the 2 September and everyone turned out as a mark of respect to follow the deceased’s remains to the cemetery.  He was a member of both the Freemasons and the Oddfellows, and members of these lodges turned out to form one of the largest funerals seen in Burra.

On Saturday Mr McEllister addressed electors in the large room of the Burra Hotel.  His answer to the question whether he would support the extension of the railway was memorable: ‘Yes, by J _____ s, I will, through thick and thin, to Mount Remarkable, if it’s wanted.’  As yet there is no opposition in the field.

[Note that a letter to the editor from McEllister in the paper of 14 September page 3 denied that this vulgar and impious sentence had been uttered and ascribed it to the animus of the local correspondent.  He notes that their correspondent who reported the actual meeting did not attribute any such statement to him.]

The talented Nelson Family gave three of their popular musical entertainments here in the last week.  The poor weather did not prevent a good house on Monday and a fresh program on Tuesday drew the biggest house yet seen here.  The Wednesday performance also drew a full house.

[How a report dated 9 September got printed in Adelaide in the paper of 10 September is rather hard to fathom.]
