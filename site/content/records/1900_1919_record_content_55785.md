Editorial on Violet Day, to be held 24 June.

The editor reflects on the first Violet Day in Burra when a bunch of violets was auctioned and bought, raising almost £400.  The mood of that time was of ‘comparatively light-hearted enthusiasm’, which has become now more one of ‘a stern sense of duty and a determination to “stick it” to the last’.  Unfortunately in the process some have become deaf to patriotic appeals.  Perhaps what they need is an occasional air-raid to remind them that the deadliest war of all history is raging.  The day is dedicated to the no less than 70 local boys who have made the supreme sacrifice and they deserve a large gathering and the breaking of previous records.
