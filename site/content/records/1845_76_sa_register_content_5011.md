John P. Winchcombe charged David Ballard with assaulting him.  On 29 July the defendant came to Winchcombe at Apoinga with a whip in hand and asked him why he had stated untruths about him in the newspapers.  When Winchcombe refused to fight him, Ballard struck him two or three blows before someone intervened and took him away.

Ballard said he had been provoked by lies put into the paper by Winchcombe about him in connexion with a drunken woman who was in court in Kooringa a few days previously.

His Worship said that such might be pleaded in mitigation; it did not excuse the assault.  After reading the newspaper account His Worship said he could not see anything to provoke the assault.  He imposed a fine of 20/- plus 27/- costs.
