Mt Bryan Ratepayers met at the Mt Bryan Council Chamber on Saturday afternoon when Mr C. Bowman presided to consider the advisability of West Ward being separated from the Eastern Wards for the better working of the district.  This follows a decision at the last meeting of the Council for future meetings to be held at Mongolata, where a room has been obtained.  West Ward Councillors objected to going so far, especially as Mt Bryan had every convenience for meetings.  The Council Chamber was erected before the Eastern Wards joined the Council.  90% of business transacted deals with West Ward.  Travelling expenses of East Ward Councillors swallowed up all the revenue.  Cr Griffith Harry moved the separation of West Ward from East and Middle Wards and Mr C. Dawson 2nd.  A delegation was chosen to present a petition to the Commissioner of Crown Lands.

[Considerably more detail of the case is reported.]
