Ulooloo Goldfields.  The Government Geologist gives a lengthy report on the diggings.

The fields are situated in the Hd of Hallett and were discovered in 1870 or 1877.  The first workings were on Section 650 on the ‘white lead’ and afterwards work was on Noltenius Ck, Section 673 and later along Coglin’s Ck.  Work has been intermittent and at present 80-100 men are employed there.  The amount of gold won is unknown, but £18,000 worth has been sent in via Hallett P.O.  All won so far has come from alluvial works.  The only permanent water supply is Ulooloo Ck and all sluicing is now done near the junction of Ulooloo and Coglin’s Creeks.  Many small gullies could store water for sluicing.  Gold exists in Old Tertiary drifts, in ancient creek beds (newer gold drifts), and in existing creek beds.  [The report then goes into more detail of where these deposits are located.]

The principal work is now carried on between Scrubber’s Ck and the White Lead, sinking some 30-40’.  Payable amounts are being retrieved.  The Government party is at work on deep ground near the junction of Coglin’s and Ulooloo Creeks and have prospected across an old channel of Coglin’s.  They have obtained a small quantity.

Further down Ulooloo Ck attempts to sink some 40’ have been frustrated by water inflow, which could readily be overcome by pumping.  Systematic prospecting is limited by most of the area being private land and by lack of water.  The quart and ironstone reefs should be prospected.  [Figures of gold obtained are then cited.]

The field has been worked for 15 years continuously, but with sometimes only a few men, now there are about 100.
