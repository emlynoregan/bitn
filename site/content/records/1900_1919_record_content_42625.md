Australia Day.

The combined patriotic committees met on 13 July to arrange for Australia Day on the 30 July.

The money raised is to supplement the pensions of returned soldiers.

A decorated motorcar procession was agreed upon.  The Burra Automobile Club was asked to help and the Burra Band to play selections in the afternoon.  It was resolved that an auction sale be held in the afternoon and a large silk flag of the Commonwealth, 6’ x 3’ signed by Lady Munro-Ferguson [wife of the Governor General] to be offered on the day by the Bugler system, to go in the end to the highest aggregate bidder – also 50 silk Australian flags signed by the Governor – or by the Governor General if his signature was obtainable.  The ladies to provide afternoon tea.  A concert to be held in the evening in the Institute.  Various committees were established to organise the above.
