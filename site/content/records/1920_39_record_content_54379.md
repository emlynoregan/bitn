Burra Town Council, 14 January

J.H. Harris the Ranger reported that while he was taking stray cows to the pound Mr Nankivell claimed one and offered to pay the pound fee.  The Ranger refused, upon which Mr Nankivell forcibly took possession of the animal.

Cr Dow thought taking the fee would have been the easy way out.

The Mayor said taking the cow was an action that could not be allowed and it was resolved to send a letter to Mr Nankivell advising him of the heavy penalty for forcibly taking impounded animals, but waiving any extra penalty on this occasion provided the pound fee was immediately paid.

The Town Clerk advised that under the New Act the Council had to declare a seven monthsâ€™ rate to the end of June to clear the Council for that period.  The amount necessary would be 1/6 in the pound.  The Council would then begin a new financial year on 1 July.  This was adopted.

A minute of appreciated was recorded for the work of the Fire Brigade in the recent fire and for the prompt action of Mr J. Isaac the water supply engineer.

Cr Kellaway reported that in Lower Thames St and Stock St cars continually used the footpaths.  Police will be asked to co-operate in the matter.

Cr Jennison raised the question of giving work to men not on rations.

The Mayor said the Council could employ whoever they liked at their own expense and the overseer said when deserving men not on rations applied he gave them gravel to raise.
