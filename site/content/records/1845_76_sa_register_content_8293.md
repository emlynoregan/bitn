Kapunda News

The crossing place of the Light at Kapunda is all but impassable.  Loaded drays sink to the axles at the risk to damage of the goods they carry.  Money has been voted for a bridge, but a few loads of stone would remedy the present situation until labour to construct the bridge can be obtained.

A wheelwright is badly needed in Kapunda and a schoolmaster at Kapunda North.
