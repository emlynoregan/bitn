Burra Town Council, 6 July.

The resignation of Cr Lockyer was accepted.

Mr Hardy has allowed himself to be nominated.

W.H. Hardy writes querying whether the Mayor can legally pay a Council employee a bonus without Council approval and whether he can allow business decided upon at a special meeting to be carried out before it is approved by the Council in a general meeting.
