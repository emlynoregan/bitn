Mongolata Goldfield

Norman Ford continues to make good finds on Byles’ Claim and he has got good gold from discarded material after washing dirt with carted water.

On Terry’s Claim very fine gold is found called mustard or flour gold.

J.O. Critchley MP has written to the Mayor saying that the Government is interested in encouraging the field, though it has little money to assist.  He suggests a public meeting to press the necessity for some Government assistance might be useful.

The Mayor said some men might soon have to give up the work through lack of boots and clothing.

Cr Bevan said if the Mines Department had subsidised the Oodnadatta Syndicate surely they could do something where there were already results to show.  The town should assist all it could, as if the show became anything decent the town and business people would benefit.

Cr Button said the Oodnadatta Syndicate had received no money, but the men got railway passes, two months’ rations, tents and free railing of the motor truck.  He favoured a public meeting.

The Mayor thought a battery in the town would serve Hallett and other parts of the district, but if it were at Baldina Creek housing would need to be supplied.

Cr Bevan thought the shows would have to be more sustained to sustain a battery.  What was presently on site would not keep a battery going for a day.

A public meeting will be called on a date to be fixed.
