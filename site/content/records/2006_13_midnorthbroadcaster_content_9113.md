Paxton Square Cottages Operations Committee reports a pleasing outcome from the meeting on 20 October of the Regional Council of Goyder.  The cottages CAD debt will be repaid as follows: $50,000 from the Burra Ward Capital Fund in 2009/10, $17,000 from the Burra Ward Capital Fund for three years commencing 2010/2011, $22,000 from the Paxton Square Cottages Operating Profit for four years commencing 2009/10, with the Council withstanding the interest.  The Committee will now be able to look at where the money can go back into the cottages, which will assist with maintenance and upgrades and will enable an ongoing workable budget to be established.
