Burra Town Council, 19 June

A.T. Tuck headmaster of Burra School suggested the planting of trees opposite the school house in the park and said the school would tend them.  Council agreed with a limit of 50 trees.

Approval was given to top some trees in Paradise and Aberdeen.

Cr Bevan was surprised that no application had been received from MUIOOF Aberdeen for permission to build a hall â€“ he said it must have been an oversight on the part of their secretary.  Consideration was deferred to the next meeting.

[Cr C.R. Bevan was the responsible person!]

It was resolved to sell the 26 unclaimed blocks in the Corporation on which rates had not been paid.  They are to be placed in the hands of Goldsbrough, Mort & Co.  Purchasers are to be responsible for land tax and water rates owing.

Various road matters followed.

Cr Jennison asked about the road along the creek towards Aberdeen Tennis Courts.  He asked if it were an avenue, because if so the Council would have to keep up two roads.  [This is unclear.]
