Of the total profit £168-19-1 came from the Queen Competition.  The profit of £25-17-0 on the sports makes it doubtful if the effort is justified.

Anzac Day & Armistice Day services were well attended.

Finances at present show £186-14-0 in the General Fund and £130-18-0 in the Local Relief Fund.

Elected: President, G.S. Hawker; Vice-Presidents, D. Keynes & S. Genders; Secretary, H.E. Fuss & Treasurer, M.T. Fuller.

It was decided to hold an Anzac Sports Day and a dinner and to contact the Waikerie Band concerning the Anzac Service.
