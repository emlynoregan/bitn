Burra National Trust will welcome a visit by the Department of Mines and Energy’s geologist and information officer, Mr Greg Drew on 7 September.  He will give an illustrated account of his recent trip to the copper mines of Cornwall.  His information will be of great use when the Morphett pumphouse at Burra was restored.  This was operating in the days before photography was developed and there are no good pictures of what it looked like, said Branch President Maureen Wright.  Mr Drew will conduct a tour of the Morphett’s pumphouse, the old smelts area and the buddle pits on 8 September.  Many of those who went on his last tour in April said they had not realised how historically fascinating the area was and how much remained there.  About 25 people had gone on that tour.  Mr Drew is currently researching Morphett’s pumphouse, winding house, and mine, with a view to the restoration of the pumphouse.  The buildings and shaft are currently in ruins and fenced off from the public because they are dangerous.
