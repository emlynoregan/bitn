The development of the grounds will come from the bonds, which brought in £465.  The wall will cost more than £400.  Additional funds will be needed to cut the high part and fill the lower.  The football and cricket clubs should raise money by a series of concerts and £20 will also be needed to get water from a reservoir formed by an old quarry.
