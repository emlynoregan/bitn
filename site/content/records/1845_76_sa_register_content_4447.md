Burra Burra Oddfellows’ Lodge celebrated its first anniversary on 14 March, but as many members were involved in the Sessions in Adelaide the celebrations were held on 21 March, when Brothers assembled at the Burra Burra Hotel at 4 p.m.  Led by a band they marched through the streets to the church, where Rev. Bro. James Pollitt preached an appropriate sermon.  Almost 100 sat down to dinner, provided by the new host at the Burra Burra Hotel.  The Chair was held by Vice Grand Thompson.
