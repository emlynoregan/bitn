Edward VII’s Proclamation.  Notwithstanding earlier statements reports now indicate that the king was proclaimed in Adelaide on Wednesday after the Imperial troops arrived and not on Tuesday as originally planned.  It also seems to have occurred at Victoria Park rather then Montefiore Hill.  About 50,000 turned out for the parade through the city.
