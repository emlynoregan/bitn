Burra Boys’ Club held a four day camp at World’s End Gorge over Easter led by Mr L.H. Foote.  It was most successful with an open-air gymnastic display on Saturday evening on the flat by Mr Schmidt’s residence.  About 70 people attended.  The grounds were lit with acetylene lamps and Mr Finch’s car lights.  Rev. Ingamells held a church service on Sunday morning for the lads and 46 local residents near the foot of the waterfalls.
