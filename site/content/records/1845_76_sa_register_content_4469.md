An Artful Dodge at Port Henry [i.e. Port Wakefield]

Someone has persuaded the Lieutenant-Governor to put up for 14-year lease a 14¾ acre site at the new shipping place at the head of the Gulf St Vincent.  A petition against this has been sent to him, urging the immediate withdrawal of this offer because the purchaser of the lease would be able to monopolise the whole of the carriage from the Burra Mine; al traffic having to pass through such lease.  The memorialists request instead that the land be made available for sale in one-acre lots, and that certain reserves be included for the security of the public.

[Greater details in outlining the borders and position of the block in question are given.  The editor does not doubt that the Lieutenant-Governor will accede to this request in the interests of competition and the public good and endorses the call for the sale of the land in one or one-half acre allotments.]

The natural advantages of the locality may be estimated from the fact that Mr Buck’s 100-ton barge is placed so that drays may come alongside and load or discharge as the case may be.  Viewed in connection with neighbouring mineral lands and pasturages, the natural harbour of Port Henry is a very important feature.
