The Northern Territory will cease to be a white elephant for SA.

There will be uniform quarantine regulations.

There will be uniform lighthouse provision.

Copyright will be Australia wide.

Immigration of criminals will be able to be better controlled.

Judicial rulings will be applicable nationwide.
