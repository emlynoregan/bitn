Burra Town Council, last night.

At 7 o’clock the minutes were being read when Cr Hardy demanded of the Mayor that Cr Sampson withdraw something he had said to Cr Parks.  The Mayor asked what the words were.  Cr Hardy said that Cr Sampson had said: ‘You’re a d______ cocktail.’

Cr Sampson grew indignant and said it was a lie and added ‘I’ll smack you across the nose if you tell such deliberate and designing lies about me.’

Cr Parks also assured Cr Hardy he was mistaken.

The Clerk then continued to read the minutes.

Cr Rabbich then moved they go into committee and they did.

Cr Sampson told the Councillors they were not worthy to represent the ratepayers and Cr Rabbich had broken the record for any Council in SA through calling in the police to oust ratepayers.  He said the Burra Town Council was the most disgraceful organisation in the colony.

Meanwhile the ratepayers were out in the cold.  The press reporter was shivering and had started to sing Let Me Like a Soldier Fall when duty intervened and he endeavoured to take notes by the light from the keyhole.  At 10 to 8 Crs Sampson and West left the room when a motion to conduct the business in public was lost.  They handed a written protest to the Town Clerk.

Cr Harris appeared to find the staying officers, but managed to collect only the Inspector.

A memorial asking the Council to construct a ford over the creek opposite the railway goods shed was received and council will report on it next meeting.

A resolution was passed expressing Council’s strong feeling that it was ill-advised and unjustifiable for an officer of Council to make comments on the action of Councillors.

A requisition is being prepared which will ask the Mayor to call a ratepayers’ meeting on the advisability of requesting the Councillors to resign.
