Burra Show Society Meeting, 19 November

President I.J. Warnes said they knew for a long time that the Society was seeking a ground of its own.  A meeting two years ago considered it, but decided on no change.  Messrs Bartholomaeus, Robinson and Warnes had inspected the paddock under consideration adjacent to Mr Montgomery’s house and close to the railway line.  Mr Bartholomaeus said he would sell 30 acres for the purpose for £6 an acre.  Mr Warnes said that was not playing the game.  He would give him £12 per acre for 15 acres and present it to the Society. If Mr Bartholomaeus would give the other 15 acres.  The committee then visited the site and was in favour.  The land was easily worth £180.

This was not motivated by any feelings against the Sports Syndicate or the Race Club.  A problem was that it cost about £40 per annum to ready the ground for the show.  This could be better spent on improvements.  It would also allow permanent plans for uses like the sideshows.  The present site was perfect for a jumping ground, but they could not put seats around it.  The slope of the new ground would enable a natural amphitheatre for car parking with views from behind unhindered.  Every year some equipment went missing.  The new ground needed some levelling, but that could soon be done.  A railway line to the new ground was also a possibility.  Their assets at the existing ground were worth c. £700.  Mr J. Melrose had offered to pay for moving the assets.  Mr Warnes said he would give £300 extra if members contributed a similar amount.  The new ground would allow local horses to train there.  Fencing should be done by letting it out to advertising.  Mr Radford moved that the offers of Messrs Warnes, Bartholomaeus and Melrose be accepted and he spoke in support thereof.  W.H. McWaters seconded it.

Mr George Parker supported the move, as did Mr Lott and Mr A.D. McDonald.  It was passed 38 to 3.

The President said that though they had no legal right to move their assets he knew the members of the syndicate were gentlemen and he anticipated no difficulty.  Mr Gallagher, who was a member of the syndicate agreed.
