Lost Children.  On Sunday two little girls aged 7 and 5, daughters of Thomas Parks and a 5-year-old son of Mrs Claire Tiver went missing.  When they had not been found by dark a large number of people joined in the search.  Mrs Tiver found them huddled in a creek in Mr Tennant’s paddock.  She then lost her bearings in the dark and other searchers finally heard her calls for help at 6.45, by which time all the party were drenched by rain and shivering with the cold.  Had the children not been found by Mrs Tiver they must have been drowned, for the creek shortly after came down a banker.
