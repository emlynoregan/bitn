A & B	Faces from the façade of the Royal Exchange Hotel.

C	The upper floor of the Visitor Centre.

D	The parapet/pediment above the hairdresser’s in Commercial Street.

E	The parapet of the former Bank of Australasia – later the ANZ Bank.

F	The parapet of Wilkinson’s Pharmacy building in Market Square.

G	Wheat sheaf design on the parapet of the Goyder Council Office, dating from its erection as a South Australia Farmers’ Union store.

H	A toilet bowl from the Bushman’s Rest Hotel in Burra North.  [In 2005 a lonely remnant of this demolished building and soon afterwards removed.]
