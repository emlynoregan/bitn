Mongolata Goldfield

Byles Mongolata GM sent 565 tons to the battery last year for a return of 246 oz 9 dwt 17 gr valued at £2,143-16-0, which is to be presented by directors at the annual meeting on 27 May.  Costs were £5,474 and after battery charges were deducted the gold returned £11854.  Since then the shaft has been sunk to 320 ft.  The loss for the 12 months was £1,011 and the cash in the bank and at hand at the end of the term was £442.  Work in the past 12 months has been mainly developmental.  A new main shaft has been sunk and the old main shaft will be converted to a chute for the disposal of ore from the open cut, which in time will open up the whole side of the hill.  The open cut was found to be the cheapest method of operation.  Costs there are about 13/- per ton, making returns over 2 dwt per ton payable.  Assays suggest a yield of between 4 and 5 dwt per ton.  Shares have been paid up to 11/- in each £1 and were quoted yesterday at 4/6 buyer.
