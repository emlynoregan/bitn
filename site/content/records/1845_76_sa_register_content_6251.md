[He went on at some length and some of his points were:

He was in favour of universal suffrage.

He favoured voting by ballot.

He had seen most of the Directors of the SA Mining Association and had been assured they would not influence a single vote and he had assurances from Mr Walters of the Patent Copper Company to the same effect.

He favoured steps for the intellectual improvement of the people

Steps needed to be taken to promote education of children in the bush.

He was a strong supporter of Sunday schools.]

At one point he said ‘The working man wants plenty of work.’  This was met with a retort ‘No, we want plenty of money.’

David Graham spoke briefly in support of Mr Stocks.
