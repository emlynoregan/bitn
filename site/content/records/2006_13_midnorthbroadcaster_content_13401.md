Peter Batten writes re Burraâ€™s future.  He floats the idea that education would be a viable alternative to mining as a way to inject jobs and money into the town and so provide for its growth and its future.  He suggests a residential college for 200-300 students would fit in with sustaining the heritage values of the town.  The aim would be to attract international students and five star accommodation for visiting parents etc. would be needed.  Modern medical facilities would also be needed.
