Obituary & Inquest.  P. Lane JP as coroner at inquest on the body of Emma Gurney.

W. Geake was foreman of the jury.

Mrs Lucy Gurney of  Kooringa gave evidence of her daughter’s return to her house, ill, on Wednesday evening, by cab.  She was unable to walk.  The doctor came and gave her some medicine and said he would call again in the morning.  She sent a message in the morning saying it was no use to come, as her daughter was dead.  She had complained of pains all through her body.  She had given her medicine at 2.55 a.m. and she was dead when the mother had got up to call the boy to work at 4 a.m.  Thought she was about 18.  She had been keeping company with a hairdresser from John Snell’s.

Dr Brummitt said that on Wednesday evening the deceased had seemed to be suffering from inflammation of the lungs and pleurisy.  He had not anticipated a fatal result so soon, if at all.  So sudden a death was unexpected.  The post mortem showed pleurisy with the right lung extremely inflamed and the left congested.  This is believed to be the cause of death.  Nothing suggested poison.

Frederick Simpson said he employed Emma Gurney for six days at the Railway Restaurant.  She had seemed very poorly at work and had been given light duties.  On Tuesday he had seen her drink from a small bottle, but he did not know if she was in the habit of taking medicine.  She had not complained of illness before last Tuesday.

Dr Sangster, who had assisted at the post mortem, agreed with Dr Brummitt.

The jury gave a verdict of death from natural causes.

[Born 26 March 1868 and registered as died 2 December 1885 aged 17.]
