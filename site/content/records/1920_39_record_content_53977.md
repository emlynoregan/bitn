Weather.  A Major Dust Storm

The 17 December 1934 should be remembered as Red Monday.  Sunday was hot and sultry, but cooled a little at night.  On Monday morning there were low clouds that seemed to threaten rain, but by 10 a.m. a dust haze had displaced the clouds and both wind and temperature began to rise.  By lunchtime it was 100°F and dust was blowing furiously.  The school could not be seen from the post office.  At 2.30 the temperature dropped to 92°F and thunder and lightning began.  Lights had been required in businesses for hours.  In the eerie red dust streetlights and car lights appeared a deep blue in a most unnatural manner.  The children were sent home at 3 p.m., unable to see to do their work.  At this time rain began to fall as red mud and by 4 p.m. the temperature had dropped to 80°F.  On Tuesday it was cooler and people were busy washing red mud from buildings etc. and window cleaning was the order of the day.  Water in tanks was too discoloured for laundry use and it will take a couple of days to clear.
