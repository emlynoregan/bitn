Stony Gap Wind Farm Appeal

An article further explains the Council’s legal position in withdrawing from the case to defend the Council’s Assessment Panel’s refusal to grant development plan consent to the Stony Gap Wind Farm proposal.  Apparently Coffey and Dunn wish to continue the appeal hearing (scheduled for 16 May) and if they do so it will be totally at their cost.  The Council’s costs thus far a said to total about $15,000.  The Council has now negotiated an amended proposal with Truenergy that it believes is satisfactory to both parties.  Both parties are now seeking ERD Court consent to the amended proposal by way of finalising the appeal.  No turbine will be located within two kilometres of a dwelling.
