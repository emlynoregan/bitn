Rabbits are so prolific along the Northern railway line that immigrant workers sent to work there abandoned their jobs when they found local rabbiters were earning some seven times their wages.  Local pastoralists have experienced similar trouble in obtaining labour.  One local pastoralist has overcome the problem by supplying his employees with all the netting they want and letting them hunt from Saturday morning to Monday morning.  Burra Town Council is finding it difficult to get labourers as so many have gone rabbiting.  Thousands of rabbits are passing through the local freezing works and chillers every week, but still their numbers seem to be increasing.  Most dams over many square miles have been netted and rabbits are getting used to netting and are learning to avoid it.
