On 20 September C.W. Gare told his son Mr I.E. Gare to put about 1,027 lambs and 428 sheep into Austin’s paddock near Copperhouse.  The next day while repairing the fence they found a skin and head of a lamb.  He valued the lamb at 10/-.  Ivon Edward Gare corroborated the above.

M-C G.H. Robinson & Sgt McDonald attended and followed tracks to the sheepskin and identified it.  They then followed tracks westerly towards Copperhouse.  They were visible at intervals for about a mile and ended at an old house in Copperhouse where some men were camping.  They identified the boots of William Adlan as making one of the tracks.  Fresh mutton was found on site, though Adlan had previously denied having any meat.  Another man William Stanley Eccles Gibson was identified as making the other track.  They said a third man who was present was not involved.

George E. McDonald gave further detailed evidence and the two were committed for sentence.
