SA House of Assembly Elections.  Messrs O’Loughlin, Miller, Hannaford and Newland addressed voters at the Institute on 28 February.

Hannaford called himself a ‘Ministerialist’ [Which basically meant he was a conservative, but was free to criticise a conservative Government.]  He was pro-government and anti-Labor.  He was in favour of increasing the 75% of revenue going to the Federal Government, because of the extra expense of the old age pension.  He favoured cutting up the large estates for closer settlement and even, perhaps, for compulsory purchase.

L. O’Loughlin was a Liberal and favoured closer settlement.  He thanked voters for their previous support.  He did not want to say anything against the Labor Party, but would continue as a Liberal.  He objected to vulgar interruptions, but would answer any questions.  In his term in office great things had taken place in respect to farming and this was due to the cutting up of large estates.  The Bill was introduced in 1897, though it had not made much headway for some years – he went on to say more about developments around the state that were a consequence of closer settlement.  He made reference to the franchise and to tax and to proposals to open up Eyre Peninsula where new railways were required.  He thought the Commonwealth should take over the NT and that strikes should never be permitted.

J. Newland, Labor, was for abolishing the property qualification for the franchise and hoped at least to get it down below the present £15.  Everything was done in the interest of the farmer and nothing in the interest of the labourer.  NT should belong to SA and the recent negotiations on it were so secret that even the blotting paper was destroyed.

Mr Miller said the greatest changes during the last 8 years that he had worked for Burra had been in getting people onto the land and he hoped a major scheme for increased settlement would soon be brought about on Eyre Peninsula, where the land was even better than around Pinnaroo.  The opening of new country would probably obviate the need for compulsory purchase.  The Booleroo Centre and Angaston railways helped this closer settlement.  He then mentioned the Pekina creek water scheme.  He believed in a progressive land tax.  The federal Government should take over the Northern Territory.  It was dangerous to have such a large area lying idle.  An interjector suggested that the ‘Japs’ might ‘collar it’.
