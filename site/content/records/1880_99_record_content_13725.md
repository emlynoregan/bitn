Burra Town Council.

The night cart is to be loaned to people wishing to use it for 5/- per night.

28 ratepayers presented a memorial desiring that the Salvation Army be prevented from parading the streets on the Sabbath with a brass band ‘in desecration thereof’, ‘utterly subveraive [sic] of the decorum which should characterise a day set apart for rest and devotion.'
