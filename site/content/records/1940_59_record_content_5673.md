Scovell’s Commercial Hotel is the prototype of the country inn with a jovial landlord.  The Commercial is better known as Scovellia or Tom Scovell’s Hotel.  Tom had many years’ experience at Saddleworth, where his name was almost an institution. He takes an active interest in every aspect of civil life and has created at the Commercial a club-like aspect, with an excellently equipped dining room and excellent food.  The accommodation is excellent and there is a really good hot water service.
