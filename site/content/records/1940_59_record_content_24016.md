Compulsory Acquisition of the Adelaide Electric Supply Co.

A statement by the company’s Chairmen on this matter is printed at length in an article extending some 4½ columns.

The Government is about to have the Bill debated in the Parliament.

The Bill provides that the undertaking will be seized by the Government without any payment whatever to the company.

Of course the Government will say that they are paying the shareholders for the full value of the assets.

This is not true.

The compensation is not purchase money.  The compensation is to be measured by the Stock Exchange value of the different classes of shares as at 1 August last.

This represents much less than the value of the assets.

The Chairman then goes on to explain how the process will affect the different classes of shareholders.

He gives the history of the bill before Parliament and how it is related to the history of Leigh Creek Coalfield.

He outlines the arguments the Government had advanced and dismisses them as specious.

He goes on the discuss the position of Debenture Holders – as far as he can see the debenture holders have rights under a contract made in England that cannot be overridden by the Government, meaning that the Government will have to find about £2,000,000, of which  about £805,000 will be payable in England.  The Bill does not say where this sum is to come from.

The meeting passed a resolution strongly protesting against the proposals contained in the South Australian Electricity Trust Bill for the compulsory acquisition of the Adelaide Electric supply Co. Ltd.
