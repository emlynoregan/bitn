Peter Schiller of Eudunda also writes in support of the Sports Complex proposal.  He thinks it would be a valuable and viable asset for which government funding is available.  In any case, given that the Eudunda Ward ratepayers would be accepting liability for the costs, Mr Woolley and other opponents from Burra should mind their own business.
