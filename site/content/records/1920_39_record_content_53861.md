Jimmy Melrose the well-known aviator flew very low over Burra on Monday afternoon.  He was en route to Adelaide after spending a few days with his relatives at Hallett.  He was known to be in the area, having visited the Goldsbrough, Mort sale on Friday with Sir John Melrose.  School children rushed to the windows to get a glimpse of ‘My Hildegarde’ as it passed.  He is said to have surprised a man east of Burra last week when he landed and asked the most direct route to Hallett.  Others say he stopped for a drink.
