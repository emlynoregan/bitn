A New Kooringa Post Office.

A party comprising the Mayor (S. Burns), P. Lane & Dr Sangster jun. met the Hon. R.W. Foster and Mr Murdock, architect for public buildings, to look over the post office.

While there an unofficial delegation (not from the Council) waited on Mr Foster requesting that the post office be sited in Market Square.  This revealed deep divisions in the town between those for a Market Square site and those for leaving it where it is.

Mr Crewes:

For Market Square as being more central to business.  The Aberdeen end’s needs were met by their own post office.  Costs of renovation were very heavy and it was better to start again.

John McLaren:

Supported Mr Crewes, despite living very near the present site.  Several people would be prepared to buy the old building as a residence.

J. Drew:

Supported Mr Crewes’ arguments.

John Pearce:

Also supported Mr Crewes’ arguments.

S. Burns:

Sat rather uncomfortably on the fence, saying ‘there were two sides to the question.’

Mr Lane:

Thought the post office was in the right place now.  Many Aberdeen people got their correspondence through the Kooringa post office.  The best site was ‘certainly not Market Square’. 

Dr Sangster:

The post office might fit in Market Square, but not the residence and as there is a Post Office Savings Bank Assoc. that serves Aberdeen people as well, the present site is better.

The Hon. R.W. Foster said it was the first he had heard of a request for a new site – he said he would pass on the deputation’s ideas, but warned that division in the town could only cause delay.  Wherever the new post office was built they could rest assured it would be up-to-date.
