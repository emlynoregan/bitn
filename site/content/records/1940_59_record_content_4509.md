Burra Soldiers’ Welfare Committee under T.H. Woollacott and A.B. Riggs make an appeal for funds to finance the wrist watches given to departing soldiers.  They have so far been disappointed with the response.  Having farewelled 55 soldiers, they have given out 25 watches and believe they need at least 25 more.  [Watches apparently cost 15/- each.]
