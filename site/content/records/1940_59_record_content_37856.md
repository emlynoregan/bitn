W.J. Corner, a driver for W. Angliss & Co., paid a couple of trappers about 30 miles east of Burra last Tuesday and then left a bag containing £70 on the running board of his truck when he drove off.  He did not miss it until reaching Burra.  A search the next day failed to locate it.  If the bag and cash are not found Mr Corner will have to replace both.  A reward is offered for the finder of the bag and money.
