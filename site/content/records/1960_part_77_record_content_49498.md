Burra Memorial Oval

Following the installation of a 22,000 gallon concrete water tank, the pumping equipment was connected to the power on Wednesday.  It will take 24 hours to fill the tank and a line of 11 sprinklers can empty it in 5-6 hours; delivering the equivalent of an inch and a half to the irrigated area.  A complete watering once a fortnight will now be possible.
