Burra Cheer-up Society.  The meeting on 31 March decided the band would officially be known as the Burra Cheer-up Ladiesâ€™ band, with Mr Jim Bentley as conductor, Miss B.E. Pearce as Secretary and Mr F. Harris as Treasurer.  10 new instruments have now been bought.  The Town Council granted use of the Coronation Band instruments and drums, but the band hopes to replace them with new in a few weeks.  The instruments will then be the property of the Burra Cheer-up Society.
