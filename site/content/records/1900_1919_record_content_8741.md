Obituary.  Mrs Kathleen Nevin, aged 65, died suddenly at Hanson.  Her husband had worked in the railways and finished up last week.  They were packing to move to Copperhouse and she may have over exerted herself.  [Catherine Nevin died 3 November aged 70 according to the registration.  Marriage records suggest she was born Catherine Seery, but the ages at marriage and death do not correspond.]
