Miss Amy Wylie presented an entertainment entitled The Grand Night with the Children at the Institute last Friday.  It was very well conducted and is reviewed item by item.

[Personal interest: ‘Master Ray Fuss and his sisters and his cousins and his aunts came forward and sang I’m the Monarch and When I Was a Lad.  (From HMS Pinafore).  This little fellow has a clear and firm voice, of which he has a good command, the vocalization being unually [sic] good.’

‘After interval T. Bentley and Master Ray Fuss proved a very acceptable item on the programme.’]
