Gold Prospecting.  Messrs W.H. Hardy, E. Johnson and A. Brandt of Burra, left last November on a prospecting trip to the MacDonald Ranges in Central Australia, for a local syndicate.  They returned last week after a most eventful time.  After many hardships they arrived in Central Australia within four weeks of leaving Oodnadatta with two horses and a spring dray, having walked the whole 400 miles on account of insufficient horse strength over heavy tracks with long stretches between water.  Mr Hardy had very favourable opinions of the Arltunga Fields, having been there some 5-6 years before and not changing his mind this time.  Their early return was due to the half-hearted funding by the syndicate.  The field was dominated by many well prepared parties in command of large amounts of capital.  Still he fears much harm is being done by speculators and boosters, beating up the value of stocks far too high before men actually on the field have had a change to prove the real value.  Much more honesty is required.  Despite all, he thinks there are real prospects for genuine investment and for properties worked honestly.  So far he says the White Range Field is the only proven one.  There reefs are true and plentiful.  What is needed is for a big company to buy out the smaller ones, provide water and introduce machinery.  The Hardy party did peg out a claim which assayed 8 dwts gold and 17 oz silver per ton, which a company with a battery and water could make pay, but they had to abandon it.  Hardy finds the country not bad to live in.  The climate in the ranges is splendid, but provision must be made for a permanent water supply and sanitary arrangements attended to.  The best way to get to Arltunga is by train to Oodnadatta (£3-1-4 from Burra) and then per mail coach for £9 plus provide your own provisions.  The trip takes about 3 weeks.
