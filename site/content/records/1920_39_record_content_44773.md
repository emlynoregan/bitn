Mongolata Goldfield (Reprinted from the Mail.)

The Chief-Secretary Mr Whitford reported visiting Mongolata and believing it to be a valuable gold mining proposition.  He said about 100 men were employed and many reported excellent returns – several between £1,000 and £2,000 in two weeks.

In Mongolata the leads were from 6” to 6” and very irregular.  It is not at present a good field for companies, but for prospectors it will pay.  The southern end seems likely to be best.  Much of the gold is in fine strings or little flakes.  On the flat 12-ft below the surface alluvial gold at 7dwt to the ton has been found.
