The Bon Accord Mine Site & Museum was opened last weekend.  Mr Salter, the caretaker, said the approximately 500 visitors had an excellent reaction to the displays of Burra’s social and mining history.  He also works the forge and that and the lighting in the mine shaft had particularly caught visitors’ attention.  The strobe lighting in the shaft gives the impression that the viewer id descending the 27 m to the water level.  The shaft itself is about 100 m deep.  Johnny Green, the miners’ mascot, is a feature of the display as well as other aspects of Cornish culture.

‘Johnny stands on top of Peacock’s Chimney, and according to Mr Salter, one morning when the miners were about to go down the mine shaft , and they discovered that Johnny had fallen off the Chimney, they refused to go down it.’

[This sounds like a modern fabrication.  Johnny Green is now placed on top of the relocated Peacock’s Chimney, but when the mine was in operation the figure was first placed on the shears in front of Roach’s Engine House.  It can be seen there in S.T. Gill’s painting ‘Surface Operations of the Burra Mine’ of 1850.  When the pump there was replaced a new Johnny Green was placed on the shears over Schneider’s Engine House in about 1852 and can be seen there in William Bentley’s painting of 1857.  In 1858 it was moved to the shears over Morphett’s Shaft, where it remained until the latter was destroyed by fire in 1925.  It was never on a chimney.]

One of the displays is of old mining tools recovered from the mine during operations in the 1970s.  The rarest item is a leather bucket; believed to be the only one in existence from the mine.  There is a miner’s hat made of papier mâché, and a candle holder.  In another part of the museum is the model of the mine as it was in 1860, made by Pam Marlow.  This was commissioned as a Jubilee 150 project and measures 5 m x 6.5 m.  Mr Salter made the showcase for the model on which Pam laboured for about five years.  The Bon Accord cottage has also been restored for tourist accommodation and is under the care of Mr Salter and his wife.
