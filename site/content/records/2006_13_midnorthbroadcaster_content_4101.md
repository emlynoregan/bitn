Steve Kerrigan is moving to a five-year contract as Gawler Council CEO after sixteen years in Burra.  In his time here he has seen many changes: the sealing of roads to Spalding, Morgan, Robertstown and the Kooringa Road.  Redbanks Reserve has been made a Conservation Park, Burra received a new swimming pool, the local Council newspaper evolved into the Mid North Broadcaster, more houses have been constructed and in 1997 Hallett, Burra Burra, Robertstown and Eudunda Councils merged to form the Regional Council of Goyder.
