The Official Reception

There was a large gathering in Market Square on Friday afternoon for the Back-to-Burra official reception.  The Mayor T.H. Woollacott extended a welcome to visitors as a son and grandson of a family which had arrived in the district in 1845* and as a Mayor in the Centenary Year of the State.  He was delighted to recognise so many faces of old friends in the crowd.  The Corporation was also celebrating its Diamond Jubilee, having been incorporated in 1875 [sic: for 1876] as the third oldest corporated town in SA.†  The first Mayor had been Philip Lane and his Councillors had been Messrs August Bartholomaeus, Robert Sanders, John Snell, George Sara, Edward Lipsett and Joseph Roberts.  Descendants of Lane, Sara and Bartholomaeus are still taking an active interest in the town.  Most of those present had sweet memories of the past.  Every old mine chimney and old landmark had some story to tell.  The Burra Creek had been home to many men and women who had passed away, but had played their part all over the Commonwealth of Australia.  Burra could be proud of the contribution of its residents to the state over the last 60 years.  He had been asked why Burra had two floats in the Floral Pageant, but he believed it was only appropriate that the old residents of Burra have a float of their own, representing the town of many, many years ago.  Many would be pleased to know that Mr Sam Baker was present.  He was the state’s oldest living South Australian born colonist at 97 [sic: for 96].  He was born in 1840, [near‡] where Trinity Church now stands.  Mrs Klaffus had recently celebrated her 90th birthday and he felt sure all would join in congratulating both of them.

Drought and depression had given Burra many setbacks, but it was now again on the upgrade.  He congratulated all who had made such an effort to ensure the success of the celebrations.

Cr Kellaway endorsed these remarks and Cr. Jeffery added his support.

W.G. Hawkes responded on behalf of the visitors.  He thanked the speakers for their welcome and congratulated the town for the fine Floral Float.  The Old Burra Float had been more ruggedly built, but typified magnificently the life of the town 70-80 years ago.  He congratulated Mr Woollacott on being the Centenary Mayor.  Burra pastoralists had arrived in the district within a year of the birth of the state and from there had launched out into the back country to the borders of NSW and Queensland and had founded stations whose names had become bye-words throughout the Commonwealth.  The great mining development had been made possible by a discovery by a pastoralist or shepherd in 1845, named Pickert [sic§].  £5,000,000 worth of ore had been taken out in 30 years and £800,000 paid in dividends from a company with a capital of only £12,000 and a call had never been made.  After the mine closed the magnificent Cornish miners had further assisted the state develop by sinking dams, boring wells and supplying the necessities of life through the medium of their bullock wagons.  Burra had always stood in the front rank in agricultural pursuits and its stud sheep were known all over the globe.  When England had called for help in the Great War, Burra had responded with 600 men, one hundred of whom had perished in the height of their achievement.  In addition the town had contributed £60,000.  All could remember the frequency in which residents had been called to Market Square by the late Mayor, Mr E.W. Crewes.  When he launched an appeal for £2,000 no one thought he would get it, but he did, again and again.

[* Mr Woollacott’s grandfather, William Woollacott and his wife and family arrived in 1848 on the Richardson, which brought supplies for the Burra Smelter.

† It would be wise not to take this as stated without checking further. Gawler is earlier and so are several of the places now included in the Metropolitan Area such as Glenelg, Brighton and Kensington-Norwood.  A quick look did not reveal a second country town to go with Gawler.

‡  ‘Near’ because Holy Trinity Church on North Terrace Adelaide was built in 1838.

§ Thomas Pickett, (? – 1851 near Burra) He was a shepherd who discovered the copper deposit at Burra and he died after falling into a fire while intoxicated.]
