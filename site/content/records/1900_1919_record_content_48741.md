Parklands

Dead trees were removed and new ones planted.  Of the new trees, mainly pines, many have died and others have been wantonly destroyed.

The new garden in Ludgvan St has improved that part of town and a plot reclaimed and fenced near the Mine Bridge will soon be planted.

The account started in debit £47-17-4 and ended in debit £22-4-1.
