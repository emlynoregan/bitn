Burra Regional Tourism and Business Assoc. president, Peter Edson, is urging members of the community to attend the AGM on Tuesday night.  The committee has been active in raising Burra’s profile as a tourist destination.  It continues to advocate improved signage within Burra and at key points en route to it.  It has compiled a key list of business services and accommodation providers.  It continues to support ‘Jazz in the Monster Mine and the Antiques Fair and this year will co-sponsor the Open Gardens Weekend with the Regional Art gallery and the 30-year anniversary of the making of the film ‘Breaker Morant’, with a showing of the film.  BRTBA always needs people with ideas, vision and energy to promote Burra.
