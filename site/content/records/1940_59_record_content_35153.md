The association is aware of needy cases in the town and in the City the Association organises visits by fathers to Daws Road three times a week and a wheeled bed has been donated there by the Mitcham Branch. The Association also supports the Angorichina Hostel and has raised £800 for a Memorial Chalet to be erected there – to which the local branch contributed £27-10-0.
