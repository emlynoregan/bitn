L. O’Loughlin spoke in glowing terms of Holder’s role in Australian politics.

The Minister of Education praised Mr Holder’s ‘spotless character’. 

Dr Sangster gave a neat little speech in supporting the toast and others followed.

Holder in reply was visibly moved and recounted his political journey over the last 14 years and expressed his wonder at 24,000 voting for him at the Federal Convention and 37,000 for Federal Parliament.  He had come to Burra 22 years ago and felt like a stranger for a very short time and was glad not to have had to change seats to stay in Parliament.  His role was not to serve just the district, but to make SA prosperous and for this reason he stoutly opposed protective duties and tried to amend the land laws.  He had found economics easy to talk about, but hard to achieve as the electorate favoured economy in principle, but not in practice.  He was glad to have made some headway in progressive taxation.  He feared the creeping power of the Federal Government at the expense of the states and hoped SA would resist.

Mr C. Fuss proposed ‘The Ministry’ and Hon. J.G. Jenkins responded, and amid other remarks said of Holder: ‘No one could point to a blemish on his character.’

Hon. J.H. Gordon said of Holder: ‘never in the stress of the fight in political battles had he heard Mr Holder’s lips towards his colleagues give one word of reproach or one word which could be construed into one of unkindness’.

He also lauded as one of Holder’s strengths his ‘unassuming modesty’.

T. Queale proposed ‘The Parliament’.

Hon. W.B. Rounsevell praised Holder’s ability, statesmanship and sweet reasonableness.

Hon. E. Lucas replied for the Legislative Council and Mr Coneybeer MP also spoke.

Mr W.G. Martin proposed: ‘The Army & Navy’, to which Captain Humphris, Mayor of Jamestown, responded.

Mr W.E. [or F?] Mounster proposed: ‘The Ladies’ and Mr West replied.

Rev. Father Redden proposed: ‘The Press’, whose representatives responded.

A vote of thanks and Auld Lang Syne concluded the proceedings.

The editor appends a paragraph bitterly resentful of the rudeness that saw the representatives of the two city dailies called on to respond rather than the local press representative.  This was an infringement of common courtesy and bad because of the local editor’s close connection with Mr Holder.
