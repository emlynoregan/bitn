Burra Tourist Association

Chairman Chris Reed gave his report.

He pointed to the success of the ‘Passport’ system, which generated a total income of $142,784, which was distributed amongst the National Trust, Burra Mine Museum and the Council.  Highlights of the year were:

The ‘Burra’ television campaign on GTS/BKN.  Both the 30 minute special and the advertisements were of a high standard.

The colour brochure produced by Burra Community Print.

The Mid North Regional Development Board is thanked for its contribution of $4,000 towards the cost of the brochure.  Jenny O’Connor was thanked for her involvement in the Tourist Association and she and Denny were wished well in their retirement.

The Burra High School Reunion at West Lakes on 11 August attracted a large number of former students and five former teachers.
