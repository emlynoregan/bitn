Burra District Council, 1 June

The Royal Commission on Local Government Areas will take evidence at Kooringa on 21 June.

The Council appointed Chairman N.H. Pearse and Cr G.G. Hawkes as spokesmen.  Council directed them to say that the Council was operating as economically as was possible given their need to cope with Broken Hill traffic and the Mongolata Goldfield and that they are the greatest contributors to the Burra Hospital of all contributing councils.
