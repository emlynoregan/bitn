Editorial on the OUTBREAK OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR

The cause is said to be Austriaâ€™s desire for a deep-sea port on the Black Sea as her Adriatic coast was too shallow.  Russia could not allow that as it would lead to Austria disputing with her possession of the Black Sea.  The Balkan States are allied to Russia.  Germany has formed the Triple Alliance with Austria and Italy while Russia France and England form the Triple Entente.  Everything points to a huge war and that is now inevitable.  Australia will be affected in various ways.  If the Motherland needs the assistance of Australia that will be gladly given.  The Australian Government has offered its fleet and 20,000 men in the event of war.
