Another Strike at the Burra Burra Mine

Another strike has occurred at the Mine as a result of the written intimation from the Directors that wages have been reduced from 25/- to 21/- per week.

A very large number of workers at the Mine have signed a letter to the Directors indicating that they have stopped work and that unless the former wages are restored they must ‘leave the mine for some more suitable place’.  In the letter of 30 September they point out that before receiving their wages 3/- per week is deducted for house rent, 1/- for the Club and Doctor and for candles at least 3/-.  They also point out that the cost of living at this remote place is very high due to cartage, and its location removes any alternatives.  In fact they claim to have been going into debt before the reduction in wages, so that an actual increase in wages is a necessity.

[Those listed as signing in the paper report: John Davey Hailes, Malachi Deeble, Charles Read, Richard Trezise, Richard James, William Mitchell, James Hosken, Hugh Bowden, Richard Cocking, William Moyle, James Wallis and Charles Burn.]

Everyone interested in the general welfare must see much cause for regret in the declared necessity of this determination on the part of the workers.  But this feeling must be accompanied by an almost positive conviction that ‘the Directors of the South Australian Mining Association are at fault; if only because they have not suffered sufficient time to elapse since the late unfortunate disturbance.  A company able to make such magnificent dividends, and possessing such unbounded mineral wealth, ought not to set the example of any sweeping reductions, for which the plea of stern necessity cannot be urged.  We foresee and warn the Directors of serious consequences, as likely to ensue to themselves and the colony, from the adoption of a grasping and grinding policy.’
