The Terowie Uniting Church held a closing service attended by about 100 people.  Rev. Clem Christopher was the guest speaker.  He was in Terowie in 1939.  The church was opened in 1882 and was built by Sara & Dunstan at a cost of Â£1,150.  The architect was Mr F.W. Dancker of Adelaide. Much of the furnishings were by a local, Mr Tuck.
