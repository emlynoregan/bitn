Military Camp.  16 members of the 23rd Light Horse Regiment No. 4 Troop, B Squadron returned on Wednesday after eight days in camp at Gawler.  They comprised one officer, Lieut. T. Fuller, and 15 rank and file.  The local troop was very popular before the Great War and responded almost in its entirety to the call to arms.  Today there is room for more recruits.
