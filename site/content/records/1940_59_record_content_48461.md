Fire.  Part of the back premises of Matthew’s Emporium burnt down during lunch hour yesterday.  Mostly the fire was confined to the two storey wood and iron building once used as a photographic studio.  The high narrow structure acted like a chimney.  Ray Bevan raised the alarm and volunteers did well salvaging lino, furniture and men’s clothing from fire and water damage.  The fire brigade was prompt and contained the fire quickly.  It started near a brick incinerator, but that had not been lit for three days, so the cause is unknown.  Given the way the shops in the area are all joined and that several drums of petrol were nearby, it is fortunate no worse result followed.  An auxiliary fire fighting truck of Mr M.H. Tiver came from Aberdeen and was of great assistance.
