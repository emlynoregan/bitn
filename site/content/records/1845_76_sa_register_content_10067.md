The Murray Railway: Meeting at The Burra

Dr Mayne chaired a public meeting at the Burra Hotel on Monday evening.

Mr Dale moved that the meeting was of the opinion that the best route to the Murray was via Burra, especially given the immense traffic from the Burra Burra Mine.  He said the railway would increase commerce and all aspects of business in the colony.  Wealth, revenue and trade would all rise.  Seconded by Mr Langmead and carried unanimously.

Dr Maurau moved that the amount of traffic would be greatly increased if the route went through the Burra.  Seconded by Mr Watts and carried unanimously.

Mr Corey moved the circulation through the northern districts of a memorial to the Legislative Council, with it to include, if possible, statistics of the traffic to and from the Burra.  Seconded Mr Barclay and carried unanimously.

A committee to draw up the memorial was elected: Messrs Maurau, Weir, Drew, Stanberry, Dawson, Genders and Corey.
