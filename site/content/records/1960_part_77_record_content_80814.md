Progress on the new building is said to be on schedule despite the wet weather.  The large secondary teaching complex is due for completion by 19 June 1977 when staff and students are due to transfer from the old building to the new areas so that work can then begin on transforming the interior of the old building.  The District Council is now working on levelling the area near Paxton Terrace so it can be seeded early next year to be ready for use as a playing area late in 1977.
