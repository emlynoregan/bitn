Burra Rifle Club.  Final Shoot of the season on Saturday.

Joe Bernhardt was sick and so missed the final chance to score.

Best shots on the final day were: R.J. Jeffery, E.C. Collins, A.C. Aughey & A.B. Riggs.

But for the season E.C. Hopkins and F.J. Baulderstone tied on 21 points for the Burra Record Trophy and as neither scored a point in the last shoot a shoot-off will be required next week.  E.C. Collins would have joined them if just one of his three inners had been a bull.
