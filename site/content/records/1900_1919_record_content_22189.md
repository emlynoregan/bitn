Luke Day writes a letter complaining that Rev. Winter at the Institute recently had apparently blamed Assyrians and Chinese for ‘sweating’ when there are in fact no Chinese clothing factories in the states.

[The editor replies that Mr Day is misinformed.  Rev. Winter thought that all hawkers should be abolished, including Assyrians and Chinese.]
