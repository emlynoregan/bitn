Obituary.  Mr Cecil C. Lord died at a private hospital in North Adelaide on 11 June after suffering from pneumonia for only a few days.  He was the fourth son of the late Mr & Mrs George Lord and was born at Kadina 29 July 1886.  He was educated at Moonta.  His parents later went to Broken Hill for a number of years before moving to Port Germein and then to Burra where they kept the Burra Hotel.  When war broke out on 4 August 1914 he was one of the first to volunteer for active service abroad and he left for Egypt in October 1914 with the 3rd Light Horse.  He saw the campaign right through, returning in 1918.  Prior to the war he was a keen sportsman, being especially interested in football, where he was a leading player for Kooringa, and also in coursing.  He married Jessie Hunt, youngest daughter of Mr & Mrs Alfred Hunt of Kooringa and soon after the marriage secured a business near Adelaide.  He leaves a widow and three young daughters: Shirley, Beth and Barbara.  Mr William Lord of Adelaide and Mrs W.H. Sandland of Heathmont, Burra, are now the only surviving members of the George Lord family.  Old Light Horse comrades who attended the funeral included Major T. Kenyon.  [Cecil Clyde Lord born 29 July 1886 Moonta Mines: died 11 June 1936 North Adelaide, residence Adelaide.]
