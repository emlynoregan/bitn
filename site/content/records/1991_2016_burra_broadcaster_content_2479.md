February

Firewood Creek area chosen for a project on vermin and plant control.

Redbanks picnic area closed to the public.

The Governor Dame Roma Mitchell declared Burra a State Heritage Area.  [Sic, but since this was an Australia Day event it should be placed in January.]

‘Burra Broadcaster’ published its 100th issue.
