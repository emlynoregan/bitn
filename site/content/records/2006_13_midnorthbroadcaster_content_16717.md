Immanuel Lutheran Church at Point Pass celebrates the centenary of the dedication of its tower and bell on 12 May 1913 with a special service next Sunday, with an extended ringing of the bell at 9.30 a.m.  The bell tower was built by Eudunda carpenter and builder J.A. Rohde in 1912 as an addition to the existing church, which was consecrated on Palm Sunday 9 April 1876.  The bell was made by Schilling in 1912 and shipped to SA from Ardorf in Germany.  It weighs 524 kg and at its rim has a diameter of 960 cm and a depth from rim to shoulder of 700 cm.
