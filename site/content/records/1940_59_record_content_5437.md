‘Prohibitor of Sunday Sport’ writes suggesting that Olive Bence is under the influence of backers who remain anonymous, but who are known to most folk.  The writer singles out for mention one mature woman who kneels at the altar rail regularly and gives all the outwards signs of conformity while influencing others to encourage Sunday sport.
