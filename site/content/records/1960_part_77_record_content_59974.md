Burra Saleyards

Elders-GM conducted their monthly market in the ‘Bon Accord’ Saleyards today and this was the final sale prior to their demolition.  They will be replaced by yards of steel construction.  Today’s yarding was of 6,300 sheep.  The first market was on Friday 25 November 1887 with a yarding of 25,000 sheep and 300 cattle for Elders Wool & Produce Co.

[The paper of 22 February 1972 says the first Elder’s sale was on 27 July 1888 with 4,350 sheep and 15 cattle.  This anomaly may be because of the change of name from Elder’s Wool & Produce Co. to Elder, Smith & Co. Ltd.]

These yards were reconstructed and opened with a sale on 15 October 1891 with a yarding of 25,174 sheep.  Messrs Sara & Dunstan were the contractors.  With several stock agents in the town, a combined total of 40,000 sheep a month was common.  Elders were then yarding over 200,000 sheep a year with Shakes & Lewis handling a similar number and Morris, Sandland & Barritt 170,000 to 200,000, plus some from other agents.  Over half a million sheep were handled annually until a series of bad seasons from 1892 saw a drop of more than 50%.  As other country markets grew the numbers at Burra fell.  The peak sale for SA was on 27 September 1895 when Elders at Burra yarded 44,000 sheep and sold 36,000 of them with 750 head of cattle.
