Obituary.  Mrs James Ryder died suddenly at her residence in Aberdeen on 8 May.  She was born Emily Turner in Booborowie District in 1865.  Her sister was the first Mrs John Morgan of Baldina.  She only returned to Burra about a month ago after living for some years with her daughter Mrs E. Eddy at Alberton.  She had a stroke about 12 months ago.  Her son-in-law Mr T. Villis, his daughter & Mrs Bevan were present when she died.  Her eldest daughter Mrs Nickles of Copperhouse was sent for, but arrived a few minutes too late.  There are three daughters: Sarah, Mrs J. Nickles of Copperhouse; May, Mrs E. Eddy of Alberton and Florence, Mrs C. Dickenson of Alberton.  Another daughter Mrs Thomas Villis died some years ago.  There are eight grandchildren: Mrs W.G. Lord nee Nickles (Broken Hill), Doris & Ron Nickles (Copperhouse), Lester & Ral Dickenson (Alberton), Norman, Eileen & Sylvia Villis (Burra).  There are two great-grandchildren.  [Her birth as Emily Turner at Booborowie in 1865 does not seem to have been registered.]
