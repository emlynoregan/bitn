War News

The French have taken Alsace Lorraine.  The German losses have been 30,000 and the French 15,000 in two days.

The Germans have laid siege to Liege in Belgium.

Austrian troops have entered Russia.

Japan is expected to attack the German territory of Kiao-chau in China.

Volunteers for the war are called for – they must be over 19.

Railways in SA have put married men on ⅔ time and single men on ⅓ due to there being so little traffic.  [Presumably due to the effects of the drought.]
