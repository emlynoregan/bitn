Blacksmith.  When W.J. Lee sells his blacksmith’s tools on Friday, Burra will be without a blacksmith and farrier.  With the advent of tractors and oxywelding the call for the traditional blacksmith has faded.  Mr Lee came to Burra about 40 years ago and was employed by Mr Byrne, whose business was where the Burra Motor Garage now stands.  Mr Lee set up business for himself on his present site, well over 20 years ago.  [Chapel Street near Bridge St West.]
