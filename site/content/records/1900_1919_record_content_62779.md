Red Cross met on 21 November and decided that since the need for its work is now over it will go into recess.  The members will continue to pay their contributions of 2/6 a year and be ready for action if needed.  Funds in hand are thought to be adequate for all needs and the society will continue its handicraft classes and the rest & recreation rooms.  Material on hand will be made up and by the yearâ€™s end there should be enough clothing on hand for needs.  The last meeting is planned for 19 December, unless the society is called on again.
