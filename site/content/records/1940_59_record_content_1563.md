Mr Henry Pearce came out to SA c. 100 years ago and when this area was opened up he took land at Mt Bryan.  His wife was also among early arrivals in the state.  Mr & Mrs Pearce had a family of 13, comprising seven sons and six daughters.  Two sons predeceased their parents.  11 children survive with an aggregate age of 802 years and an average age of 73.  Is this a family record?  The only ones living locally are Messrs Fred Pearce (Aberdeen), Walter & Frank Pearce and Mrs Walter Bourman of Kooringa.  Mr Louis Pearce, a grandson, still resides on country held by his grandfather.
