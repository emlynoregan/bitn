The Great Northern Mining Co. is about to commence mining operations.  Three drays laden with tools and provisions and a party of twenty persons, of whom twelve were experienced miners, were despatched north last Saturday to begin work on this discovery of Mr Finke.  Their journey is expected to take about three weeks.  The Burra Burra Companyâ€™s party started a few days earlier and so the two groups can expect to begin work at about the same time.
