BRTBA expressed its interest in running the Burra Visitor Centre at a public meeting at Burra last Wednesday night.  After discussing it with members the week before, BRTBA President Sue Ryan said they could not stand by and see its services lost to Burra.  Enquiries were made to the Council by individuals, but no interest was shown at the meeting.  The centre generates income by selling souvenir products, taking a commission on booked accommodation and by selling the Burra Passport for its owners, the National Trust and the Goyder Council.  It provides a general information service for the district.  The National Trust lease expires at the end  of the year and National Trust SA has been uncomfortable about losses made by the Burra Branch in recent years and the Goyder Council has been asked to contribute, but was unwilling.  The working party has been looking at financial figures, which show the National Trust made losses in the middle years of its five year lease, but made a marked profit in the last twelve months.
