Burra’s 110th Show* will be opened on 10 October by Ms June Appleby MP who is deputising for the Minister of Agriculture Mr Kym Mayes.

[*The correction of this repeatedly made error becomes tedious.  The correct figure cannot be obtained by subtracting 1877 from the present year.  The first Show was held in 1877, but there were no shows from 1886 to 1893, apparently due to apathy, which provoked considerable comment in the local paper at the time.  The 1897 Show was cancelled due to the appallingly bad season and the 1914 Show was cancelled due to the combined effects of the outbreak of World War I and a devastating drought.  (The event returned in 1915.)  Twenty-five years of Shows from 1915-39 ended in 1940 when the Show was cancelled due to World War II.  The Show remained suspended until 1946, since when it has been an annual event.]
