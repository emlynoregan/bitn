Unemployment.  At present there are more people out of work than for many years past. Last week a group waited on Mr W.H. Hardy to take their case to the authorities.  He has prepared a petition to the Premier asking for some work to be provided in the district which over 50 able-bodied men have signed.  Mr L. O’Loghlin MP and Hon. W.B. Rounsevell presented the petition to the Hon. Commissioner of Public Works (Mr Foster), with a request that if it were possible to start any work in the district it be done promptly.
