Burra Burra DC.  Chairman E. Finch is ill in hospital and D. Keynes presided.  Burra Town Council advised it was prepared to allow the DC to use the pound situated in Thames St.

N. Ford will therefore be advised that as a more favourable location is available his yards will no longer be needed for a pound.

E & WS Department requests permission to occupy 10 acres of Farrell Flat parkland as a camp area while the Clare pipeline is built.

Elections: nominations for council as previously noted at 72, 19, 17 May 1949, page 2.

Appreciation of the Council was expressed for the considerable services to the community rendered by Councillors Keynes & Warnes, who are retiring.
