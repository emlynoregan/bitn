Fires.  On Friday evening, just after the Broken Hill express passed, a fire broke out a little north of the long cutting towards Mt Bryan, in Mr Jos. Ford’s paddock.  For a time the high flames were feared likely to reach Redruth, but the wind shifted and turned the fire towards Mt Bryan.  In half an hour over 100 men were assembled to beat out the flames.  Water was got to extinguish the fence posts for fear of burning sparks setting fire to Mr Gebhardt’s paddock.  Stock was got out of Elder, Smith’s paddock before the fire got there.

A fire by the Waterworks shed on Saturday morning travelled west to Mr Elliott Camp’s enclosure and burnt 10 sets of fowls, harness and other items to the value of £80.

Several areas of grass were burnt close to the railway line near Mt Bryan last week.
