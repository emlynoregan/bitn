Accident.  A B-Double trick rolled over on the Morgan-Burra Road some 5 km from Burra on 31 December 2002 at 11.30 a.m.  The cabin was sheared off the prime mover, which ended upright and much of the load of 38 tonnes of barley was lost.  Amazingly the driver escaped with a scratched forehead.  Total loss of vehicle and load is put at $350,000.
