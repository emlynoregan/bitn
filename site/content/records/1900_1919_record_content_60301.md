He goes on to support a monument, but wonders if a quieter, but nearby spot, might not be more suitable than Market Square.  As a postscript he says since writing he has read Mr N. Hiles Pearse’s excellent contribution and agrees with that gentleman’s tribute to the patriotism of Burra war workers led by the worthy Mayor.

Burra Town Council.

A building application by J.A. Riggs was approved.

The Commissioner of Public Works does not approve a telephone for the Waterworks.

A letter of complaint will be sent concerning the Post Office cutting out the night delivery.

Local Board of Health.

Mr Bartholomaeus asked for the letter from the Town Clerk requesting a portion of the hospital be used as an isolation block for influenza cases to be read.

The letter asked for terms and conditions and Cr McBride said it went beyond the terms of the authorising motion and wished to know why.

The Mayor considered the words of the motion ‘steps be taken’ gave sufficient latitude.

Cr Dane supported the Mayor.

The Burra Hospital Board has decided that it would be inadvisable to grant the request.

One case of influenza has been reported.

The Isolation Hospital is without patients, so the cook and orderly have been discharged, but the two nurses have been retained for two or three weeks.  The Matron & VAD are employed by the Central Board.  Matron and Nurse Pearce are currently nursing at private homes.  The place has been made quite comfortable.  The last patient was discharged 22 May.

Mr McBride moved that the Central Board be so advised and that only one case of influenza had since been reported.  Carried.

The Mayor said no arrangements had been made about rent.  Possibly the Scouts would take over the improvements.  Cr Sampson would accept a substitute in lieu of the iron.

A letter of sympathy was sent to the Inspector in his illness.
