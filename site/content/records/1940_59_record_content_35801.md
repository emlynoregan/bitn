Burra Town Council, 1 March

The adoption of the By-Law relating to Caravan Parks was deferred indefinitely.

Burra Electric Supply Co. advised it was prepared to carry out any necessary repairs to lead-in wires, if the materials were available. Perished wiring would be attended to immediately and is material were unavailable the supply would be discontinued if reported by Council.  The Mayor said the onus should be on the company not the Council.

Mrs Campbell wrote as the owner of a grave that had been damaged some time ago and wanting to know what the Council intended doing about the matter.  She though legal action should be taken.  She is to be informed that the matter had been dealt with by the court.

The CWA wrote saying its lease on the present CWA rooms had almost expired and it wanted to know what the Council had done towards the new ones at the Burra Town Hall.

Cr S.J. Woollacott thought it was time this matter was finalised.  It was known that specifications were to be drawn by Cr T.H. Woollacott.

It was resolved that Cr T.H. Woollacott would confer with CWA members on the subject.

Cr S.J. Woollacott gave notice that he would move that a By-Law be framed prohibiting sport on Sundays on Parklands in Burra.
