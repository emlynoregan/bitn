Burra Institute, AGM.  The President, C.A. Fuss, was out of town on business and Rev. J.H. Nield, Vice-President, took the chair.  The Treasurer, T.W. Wilkinson was absent on account of ill health.  In the last year the library has been rearranged.  There are now 4252 volumes.  Subscribers are up 8 at 138.  The financial position is strong at £133-11-0 in credit.  First Aid classes had been run by Drs Sangster and Steele.  Orchestral and Choral classes had been run by Mr Dane.  In the year improvements had cost £182-9-0, of which £72-2-4 had been for improved seating.

A platform had been erected for the convenience of picture shows to keep the operator away from the crowd.

The Council Chamber had been renovated with a beautiful new fibrous plaster ceiling and a new floor and the walls had been repapered.

The caretaker’s cottage now has a bathroom.

It is intended to place another escape door on the north side of the hall early in 1915.
