Burra Show

This was held on 23 October which was a very windy day with raised dust, but attendance was very large and the show very good.  The Soldiers’ Aid Soc. ladies provided luncheon and afternoon tea and did very well.  The Burra Band was in attendance and played selections during the day.  Gate takings were £94, up £1 on 1917.
