Burra Mine.  Vandals have continued to move survey pegs at the Mine and so disrupt the Mines Department research at the site and causing extra cost. The test work is continuing.  Equipment using induced polarisation has been used.  Electrical pulses are polarised by ore pockets and the degree of polarisation can indicate the metals present.  Drilling is also continuing, though problem with sand falls and the need to cement sections have delayed this work.
