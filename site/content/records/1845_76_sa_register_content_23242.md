Northern Extension Railway.  At present the line is open as far as Manoora or Chinkford [Chingford] as the residents insist upon calling it.  The 80 miles to this point are covered in 5Â¼ hours, representing an average speed of over 15 m.p.h. and for the line beyond Roseworthy it is 11 to 12 m.p.h.  The problem is the long delays at stations; in most cases at least 15 minutes.  People will certainly demand a better result when the line is fully open to Redruth.
