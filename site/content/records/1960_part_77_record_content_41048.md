Visit of the Minister of Local Government

The Hon M. Hill with Mrs Hill and Mr Claude Allen MP & Mrs Allen visited Burra as part of a two day tour of the area.  Members of the Town and District Councils and their wives met the visitors at the Town Hall.  The ladies visited the National Trust Museum and the CWA rooms for afternoon tea.  The Minister and Mr Allen joined the Town Council in the Parlour.  The main discussion centred upon reclaiming the central portion of the cemetery.  This discussion had gone on for some years and Mr Hill brought with him the complete file.  His explanation showed the reclaiming was not simple and could, in the future, have repercussions.  He felt the opening of a new section on the eastern side of the cemetery would be more satisfactory.  Grant monies were also discussed.  The large length of roads and small population and other difficulties in qualifying for grants were mentioned.  Mr Hill was sure there was no special grant for cemetery maintenance.  He agreed with Council amalgamations in principle, but it was up to individual Councils to come to terms.  Mr Hill then had afternoon tea with the District Council.  Again he heard of the difficulties the Council was having â€“ especially the sealing of the Spalding-Morgan Road and of the Farrell Flat-Hanson Road.  Councils, he said, could do the work more cheaply than the Highways & Local Government Department.  He repeated his comments on Council amalgamations.  A deputation from Booborowie lobbied for sealing of town streets.
