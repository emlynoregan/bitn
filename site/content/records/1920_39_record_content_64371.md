Burra Swimming Pool

Government assistance is available for a loan for the pool.  If the Council borrows £400 the Government would find £38-£40 per year for interest and a sinking fund, over a ten year period.  Council passed a motion to apply for such a loan.

Council then went on to discuss the final selection of a site and the calling of tenders.

The Mayor said he believed the pool could be built for £400 rather than the £700 stated at the public meeting.  The £400 pool would take organisation and tenders would not need to be called except for the carpentering.  If he were in charge, he was going to save 6d on a bag of cement and similarly on all materials, even if they could not be got locally for the price.  Most of the work could be done as day work.

Cr Kellaway said many ratepayers expected the Council to call tenders.
