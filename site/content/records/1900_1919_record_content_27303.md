The men in question have complied with this, but Aberdeen believes if they are allowed to play a game they then qualify to play in the final whether residents or not.  Both Aberdeen and Kooringa have broken the previous rule in the past.  The men in question are presently playing with the Clare Club, which is in the Mid-Northern Association, of which rule 22 forbids playing for more than one associated club without the consent of the executive, which Aberdeen says has not been given.  Aberdeen says it has withdrawn from competition for the rest of the season.  The Association has passed a resolution not allowing matches to be played on Aberdeen oval without Association approval.  G.R. Maxwell has resigned as Association Captain to be replaced by R.J. Hill.  Farrell’s Flat, Mt Bryan and Hallett teams are being asked to join the Association for 1911.  The match with Broken Hill today will not include any of the Aberdeen players.
