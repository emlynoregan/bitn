Burra & District Hospital Women’s Auxiliary was formed at a meeting in the CWA room on Tuesday 11 December.  Mrs Andrew Tennant, representative of Burra Women’s Organisations on the Hospital Board, took the chair.  Mrs Tennant and Mr J. Gebhardt pointed out the importance of such a body in the efficient running of the hospital, especially in times like this when shortage of staff is a critical problem.  A tremendous amount of money is saved by voluntary helpers who mend and renovate hospital furniture, manchester etc. and in preserving and jam making and the like.  Elected were: President, Mrs H.L. Riggs and Secretary & Treasurer, Mrs A.D. Radford.
