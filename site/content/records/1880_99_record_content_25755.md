Football.  On 8 May only 16 men turned up at the Burra Station for the trip to Saddleworth.  From Saddleworth the trip of 7 miles in an express wagon to Auburn took 1¼ hours due to the state of the roads. The landlord of the Rising Sun Hotel provided lunch at 12 noon and they moved to the grounds at 2.30 p.m.  The ground was heavy with a pool of water in the centre.  The match started at 3.00 p.m. with Auburn fielding 20.  After 4 x 25 minute quarters with a change of ends each quarter, Burra 2.4 defeated Auburn 1.3.  The Burra players were most dissatisfied with the umpire whom they felt was very partial and ‘showed little knowledge of the game’.  Dinner was at the Rising Sun Hotel and departure was at 6 p.m. to reach home about 10.00 p.m.
