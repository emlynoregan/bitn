Burra Hospital Board meeting of 28 September

Mr Warnes moved to reduce the Board from 12 to 7 members.

This was to be done by abolishing the positions of the five directly elected members.  He believed the Board should be directly controlled by the Councils and also because a Board of 12 was unwieldy.  It was possible at present that the Town of Burra could elect all five of the elected members plus one from the Town Council.  Mr Riggs seconded the motion.

Mr Davey had it noted that such a change required an absolute majority of the Board (and not simply a majority of the Board present).  He also noted the District Councils could not collectively find over 400 votes for the five elected members and yet would, as a result of the suggested change, control six of the seven places on the Board.

Mr Collins said some of the District Council representatives could be elected by as few as 15 votes, but Mr Melrose pointed out they were, in fact, as Board members, elected by the whole DC to represent the whole DC.  He had nothing against the elected members, but agreed that a Board of 12 was unwieldy.

The motion was put and carried with Melrose, Warnes, Drew, Riggs & Kellock voting for and Sandland, Davey & Collins against.  The Chairman said if necessary he would vote for it.  Later it was agreed that Mr Daveyâ€™s point was accepted and that a vote of 7 would be needed and so the matter stayed as it was.
