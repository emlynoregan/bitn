Wind Prospect Pty Ltd is seeking provisional development plan consent for its proposed wind farms in the Hallett area.  Collectively this will involve 160 wind turbines and 17 wind monitoring towers set up in five clusters.  Goyder Council has notified all affected landowners plus those on adjoining properties and all applications have been referred to the EPA.  Transport SA will also be involved in the five applications where access is required from main roads.
