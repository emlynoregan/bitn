Obituary.  Maurice Ledwith, an old Burra resident who lived for many years at Redruth has died.

[The death does not seem to be registered in SA, but the Maurice Ledwith born c. 1841, who married Hanna Elizabeth Head in 1862, did come to Burra where the three of the coupleâ€™s nine children were born between 1878 & 1882, though in the Copperhouse & Flagstaff area.]
