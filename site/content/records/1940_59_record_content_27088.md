The Bank of Australasia is prepared to lend the Council £3,300 on the Town Hall at 4¼%.  The State Bank loan is at 4%, which costs £120 in interest.  The Bank of Australasia loan would cost about £106-5-0 if the Council has £500 on credit in any of its accounts for part of the period and the Council has that amount for a good portion of the year.  The Federal Treasurer would have to approve the change and the State Bank requires a month’s notice of intent to pay off the loan.  The matter will lie on the table to be dealt with by the incoming Council.
