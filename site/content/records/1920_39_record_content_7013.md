Burra Hospital

The Government Gazette announced this week that the hospital, which was declared a public hospital on 12 April 1877, will now become a subsidised hospital, supported by private subscription, a rate and a Government Subsidy.

The X-ray Room at the hospital will be opened by Mrs I.J. Warnes on 11 March.  A large parliamentary party is expected to visit.
