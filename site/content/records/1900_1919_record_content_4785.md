Ernest Crewes writes to the editor, drawing attention to the plight of Mr Ah Chin, who lost all his household effects, two tons of chaff, harness etc. through a fire on Monday.  He is utterly destitute with a wife and family to maintain.  As an ‘honest straightforward and hard-working man’ he is ‘worthy of all the help and support we can give him at this juncture.’

The editor indicates his willingness to receive and acknowledge all contributions sent in.
