The present supply of potable water is abundant.

The proprietors of the southern half of the Special Survey are providing comfortable accommodation for their present and future workers by numerous erections and they are well assured that the richness of their territory will afford them the most ample remuneration.

Nothing is yet known of the exploration party, which has gone so far north as Messrs White’s Station, some 150 miles from Adelaide.
