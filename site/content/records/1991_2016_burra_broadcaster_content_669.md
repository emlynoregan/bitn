Greening Burra

David & Bryan from J.D. Meats are presently organising the revegetation of the property containing J.D. Meats slaughter yards.  They have planted Pinus Radiata, Golden Cypress and Tagaste (tree lucerne) and are hoping to add 500 Blue Gum by mid-September.  In three weeks’ time they will be opening a retail nursery and florist, in which a full range of flowers, plants, organic sprays, organic compost, seedlings and ferns will be available.  It will also carry a library of gardening books.  David & Bryan also congratulate the Senior Citizens on their excellent job in beautifying the creek and banks.

The Burra Broadcaster has increased its circulation for the fourth month in a row.  The process of building a newspaper is making some headway and we are currently employing up to six people in production.    The cost to advertise with us has not changed since 1989.

[It is not clear what this means since the first issue of the Burra Broadcaster was dated early 1991, but presumably the firm had other advertising formats before the ‘Burra Broadcaster’.]
