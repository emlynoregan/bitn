Burra’s Annual Reunion at Adelaide Botanic Gardens took place on Saturday.  The deaths of K. Ewins and J. Harry removed two of the familiar faces from last year.  A list of those present is printed.  [Of personal interest those present included: Mrs M.B. Greenwood (nee Alwine/Elvine Fuss), Mrs A.B. Riggs nee Myrtle Fuss, Mrs A. Fuss nee Emmaline Rabbich and her husband August Fuss and Mrs C. Fuss nee Robertson.  This last name is probably an error for Mrs C. Fuss nee Rumball.  There was a Mrs P.A. Fuss nee Robertson, but she was married in 1925 and less likely to have been of the age group attending this reunion.]
