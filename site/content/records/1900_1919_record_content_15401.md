Redruth Court

Joe Ford sued William Paddock, late of the Bon Accord Hotel, for £11 being the rent allegedly owed on a block of land used by the latter.

Mr Ford said a woman, Mrs Hingles now deceased, had acted as Paddock’s agent and he had let the two blocks of land near the hotel for 2/- a week.

Mr Winnall for Paddock said Mrs Hingles was not Paddock’s agent.  She had been a pensioner of Mr Ford’s and lived in one of his houses.  Ford admitted she had paid no rent for the house she occupied.

Mr Sinclair said Mr Ford might ask for recompense under ‘use and occupation’, but even that was not certain.  Though he was reluctant to stop a case where there was any possibility of justice, he could not see the use of proceeding under the circumstances.
