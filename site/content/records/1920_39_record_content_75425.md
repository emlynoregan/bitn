Burra Town Council, 19 June

Tribute was paid to the Mayor S. Kellaway for his services over the last two years in that role.

The Mayor thanked Councillors for their remarks and also thanked Council staff for ably carrying out their duties.  He said he has been a Town & District Councillor for about 20 years, had always placed the interests of the people first and his wife had always been a tower of strength.  When he came to the Mayoralty the finances were in chaos, but now Â£400 for the swimming pool had been redeemed and was ready when ever the committee raised enough money to proceed.  The motor lorry had been paid off and finances should allow the incoming Council to reduce the rates.
