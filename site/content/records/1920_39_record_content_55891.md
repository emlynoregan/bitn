Accession Day – The Silver Jubilee of King George V

The gathering at the Town Hall to celebrate this occasion was comparatively small, which must have disappointed the Mayor who had gone to a great deal of trouble in the matter.  We feel it was the great number of events that have followed one another in the past week rather than any reduction in people’s love for the Throne and Empire that was the cause of the absence of so many prominent citizens.

After the National Anthem the Mayor read a message from Mr George Ritchie Acting Premier and the Town Clerk read a message to be conveyed to His Majesty through the Governor.  The Mayor then expressed his feelings of loyalty, love and respect for Their Majesties, the Royal Family and the British Empire.

Mr A.B. Riggs supported the Mayor’s remarks – but he seemed to wander off the point somewhat into criticism of the public or ratepayers for their lack of appreciation for the work of Councillors and Mayors.  He criticised the town for not pulling together and went on to speak of unemployment and unemployment relief options.

Dr Steele’s address returned to a patriotic outpouring related mostly to the greatness of the British Empire and finally assured all that ‘The United States will never exercise such an influence as does our own Empire’.

Mr Murison led the band and crowd in singing Tramp, Tramp, Tramp and It’s a long long way to Tipperary.

A.D. McDonald MP and Mr W.F. Pickering for the RSL both gave addresses.

Guy Dollman sang The Veterans’ Song: Long Live the King.

There was then more community singing before an address from Rev. E.G. Neil followed by votes of thanks and the meeting ended with the singing of The Song of Australia and a cheer for the King.
