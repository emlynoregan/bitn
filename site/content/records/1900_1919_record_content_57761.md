Burra Cheer-up Ladies’ band

This has been fully occupied with patriotic work.  As well as assisting at all local patriotic efforts they have on several occasions assisted at efforts in Adelaide.  They have also visited several country towns.  They have attended the railway station to welcome home every returning boy.  They have also collected large sums of money for the cause.
