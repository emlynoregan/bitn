BCS.  The development of a goat herd at the school has created much interest from both the students and passers-by.  A little over a year ago it began with goats caught from ‘out east’.  These were supplemented by animals from Mongolata and Quondong, donations of tame goats and the purchase of 12 dairy goats.  All the feral nannies were in kid when captured and so kids appeared at intervals.  A Boer buck and two pure Boer nannies were purchased in March and soon produced kids – the first arriving in early August.  Boer-feral crosses followed.  The dairy does were mated with an Anglo-Nubian buck before arrival.  The ferals shed ‘Cashmere’ towards spring and students have combed this off and it has been passed on to weaver Jenny Statton.  Overall there are now some 60 goats.  They have all learned to respect electric fences and so far have not breached them.  Shelter is vital and trees have been planted for them.  There is a market for goat meat at $2 per kg dressed.
