Editorial on ‘The Fiendish Swagman’

A swagman named Jones set fire to grass in the Hundred of Apoinga several days ago.  He was taken prisoner by W.G. Hawkes of Koonoona.  He started three fires in a short distance of each other and but for timely assistance all Koonoona Estate could have been consumed.  Jones is a young man who seems not to care whether he is in jail or on the tramp.
