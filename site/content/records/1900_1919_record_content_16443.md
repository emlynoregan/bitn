Obituary.  A lad named Shand, from Clare, died at the Burra Hospital last week and was buried at Kooringa.  [This boy is surprisingly hard to identify, but he seems to have been registered at birth as Ignatius Cheon born 31 July 1891 near Seven Hills and to have been registered on death as Ignatius Cichon who died 24 January 1906 at Kooringa, residence White Hut near Clare.]
