Surprise arrests in town.  On Saturday evening Thomas Fairchild reported a pig was missing, believed stolen.  On information gathered M-Cs Jemison & Phelan went to Aaron Woodman of George St with little satisfaction and then, after further enquiries, to the house of Julius Lehman.  After further investigation both men were arrested and charged with the theft of the pig.  As a couple of sheepskins from McBride’s ‘Norman Farm’ were found at Lehman’s more serious charges are likely to follow.  This has created a sensation in town as both were known as hard-working men.  Lehman, aged 30, worked for the Unicorn Brewery and Woodman, aged 29, was a road contractor.  Both are married with families.
