Letter.  Anne Royal writes suggesting that Eudunda Sports Complex is an attempt to prevent the centre from becoming a ghost town.  While not wishing to see any town in Goyder become a ghost town, she thinks this may not be a very good premise on which to build so expensive a complex.  Perhaps other issues such as employment need to be addressed.
