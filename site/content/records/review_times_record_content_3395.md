The District Council of Hallett has applied to the Local Government Advisory Commission for the Hundreds of Kingston, Mongolata, Rees and part of the Hundred of Ayers to be transferred from the Burra Burra DC to the DC of Hallett.  The Acting District Clerk Mrs Blieschke said this was in response to a request from electors in the areas concerned, who felt they were not getting enough services from the Burra Burra DC.  She said road maintenance was the key issue.  A meeting of electors will be held in the Hallett Institute later this month to discuss the proposal.
