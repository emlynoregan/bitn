St Mary’s Strawberry Fete was held last Friday and was opened by Mrs Warnes.  Attendance was good.  The Rector said that the money raised by the 1927 fete had been well spent.  £100 went to Rectory debt; £45 in interest, and £33 in necessary Rectory repairs.  It was hoped 1928 would see another £100 off the Rectory debt and the interest was due and the need for some necessary repairs was urgent.  The fete raised just over £150.
