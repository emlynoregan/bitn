RSL held its AGM in the Club Rooms last Saturday.  Elected were: President, H. Griffin; Vice-Presidents, Messrs H.C. Cornelius & L. Kellaway, Secretary, J. Sorrell & Treasurer, B. Bloomfield.

Mr Richardson, who had been President for two years, and previously Treasurer for two, was farewelled and Mrs Richardson was last year leader of the Ladies’ Auxiliary.  Mr & Mrs Richardson are moving to Keith.  A presentation of a standard lamp was made.  Mr Richardson reported a successful year.  Visits were made to Barmera Sub-Branch in August and to Clare for a games night and for their Annual Dinner.  Burra was also represented at Whyte-Yarcowie’s Smoke Social.  Various other social events were arranged including those with the Air Force Assoc., Fathers’ Assoc., Demobilised Sailors, Soldiers & Airmen’s Assoc. and the Ladies’ Auxiliary.  The Anzac Service was well attended on 27 April and a Church Parade was held at night in the Kooringa Methodist Church.  The Sub-Branch was represented at the Memorial for Air Force Week and Remembrance Day.  The Ball was enjoyed, but was not a financial success, due to inclement weather.  The Smoke Social was successful and the Christmas Tree was well attended.  We supplied the hospital with two loads of sawn timber and stumps and allowed the RSL Hall free to the 5AD Good Friday Appeal for the Adelaide Children’s Hospital and to the Burra Progress Assoc. for its Gala Night at Christmas.
