A Penguin Club has been launched in Burra.  The movement began 29 years ago in Sydney to train women in the correct use of the English language and to help them in public speaking.  The State President of the Penguin Club chaired the meeting and introduced the guest speakers: Mrs Phyllis Ward, Mrs Grant Williams and Mrs Tyler.

Elected were: President, Mrs M .Odgers; Secretary, Mrs J. Murphy and Treasurer, Mrs R. Jennison.  Forty-five ladies attended the meeting.  Membership is limited to 25 and is already fully subscribed.

Leighton Hall has been repainted and a good deal of repair work done to walls and windows.
