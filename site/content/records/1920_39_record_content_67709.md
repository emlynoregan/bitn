[Births & Deaths registrations for this family are too complex to be readily unravelled.  The Mrs Martin Hogan connection suggests the Bridget born to Thomas & Mary nee Erwin born 15 July 1889 at Upper Wakefield, making her age 48.  The births of Mesdames Horgan & McInerney cannot readily be traced to help in confirmation, nor can those of the brothers, though a John and the Miss Ann would fit with the 1889 suggestion.]
