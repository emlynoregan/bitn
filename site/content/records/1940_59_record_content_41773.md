Burra Town Council

At the last meeting the Mayor and Councillors paid tribute to retiring Cr T.H. Woollacott after 25 years’ service.

Cr Woollacott was retiring due to his wife’s ill health and also he was not in the best of health himself.  Mr Woollacott had recently moved to Adelaide, but he had done so much for the town as Councillor and as Mayor that the Mayor hoped he would visit Burra one day soon when the townspeople would be able to say ‘thank you’.

The Mayor also thanked retiring Cr Bevan for his good work as Chairman of Public Works.

Cr Woollacott thanked the Mayor and said in his time he had seen many roads bituminised and slag from the slag heap had been used.  He had been the first to realise its potential for roads and was sorry the Council had not purchased the heap.  He had been the main instigator in getting the shed built between Burra & Burra North and would request it be named the Woollacott Shelter.  The Mayor felt the Council would comply with the request.  Cr Bevan also thanked the Mayor for his remarks.
