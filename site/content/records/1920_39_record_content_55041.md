Burra Burra Show Inc.  Annual Meeting, 4 March at Eastern Telephone Building.

Mr Warnes regretted the death during the year of their oldest member Mr F. Treloar who had been a long serving secretary.

The Dog Trials and Horse Events were held 6 & 7 April.  Fewer dogs had attended than usual, perhaps due to a mix up with dates at the annual meeting.  R.W. Humphrys supplied the sheep.

Working bees had attacked the wild onion problem.

Subscriptions rose this year by c. £20.

The 1935 show will be held on 23 October.

The 1934 show was on 24 October.  The drought broke on show day which, however welcome in itself, resulted in a reduced attendance and less gate money.  The loss on the day was c. £20 and overall there was a profit on the year of £25-10-8 due to debentures given back.  This year debentures were returned by Mr W.G. Hawkes and Messrs S. & W.H. McWaters have promised to return theirs.  This would clear the debt from the building of the luncheon room at the racecourse.  [Before the show moved to its present grounds.]

Several members of the committee and others made the trip to Sturt Vale for the shearing last season and Mr Warnes hoped they would repeat the trip this year.

The elections resulted in the unopposed election of: Patron, Charles Bartholomaeus; President, I.J. Warnes and Vice-Presidents, S.H. Robinson & A.B. Riggs.
