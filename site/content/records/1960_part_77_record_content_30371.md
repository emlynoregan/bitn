Burra Burra DC, 4 July

Council adopted a new assessment based on that of the State Land Tax Department.  A general rate of 8c* in the dollar has been struck.

At the recent elections all retiring councillors were re-elected unopposed:

Farrell Flat Ward	J.H.J. Stevens

Leighton Ward	R.J. White

Mongolata Ward	B.A. Riggs

Kooringa Ward	G.R. Finch

G.R. Finch was re-elected Chairman 1966-67, with J.H.J. Stevens as Deputy Chairman.

[*Later in the same report the more realistic rate of 0.8 cents on the dollar is referred to and in 88, 29, 26 July 1966 page 1, the paper printed an apology for the mistake.]

‘Non-Local Music Lover’ writes condemning the district residents for not supporting local talent when it appears in concerts, recitals etc.  Such events are never attended by more than 100 and takings are less than $100.  It is a pity.

Mr John Phillips, teller at the ANZ Bank in Burra for some months has now been caught in the draft and departed on Thursday last for National Service training at Puckapunyal in Victoria.  His replacement is Mr Trevor Phillips from the Port Adelaide Branch.

Burra Youth Club has been given the rent free use of their hall by Burra RSL.  The club will therefore meet there in future on Saturday evenings from 7 to 9 p.m.  This venue will have more amenities and more hygienic premises.

[Note.  The club had been formed in November 1963 and from 26 June 1964 had been meeting in the Salvation Army Citadel.  At the time this was not being used by the Salvation Army, but they revived services in Burra from 6 March 1966.]
