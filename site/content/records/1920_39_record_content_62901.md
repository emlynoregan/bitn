Burra High School decided to celebrate the Centenary with a banquet and this was held on Thursday last at 11 a.m. in the school Domestic Arts Room.  President of the Literary Society, Miss Nancy Pearce, took the chair and ensured that the event ran smoothly, finishing exactly as planned at 1 p.m. Members of the High School Council attended and a good number of parents.  The catering had to provide for 50 students as well as the guests, but supply exceeded demand.  The students provided items as entertainment and proposed the toasts (except for one made by Mr P.L. Rosman.)
