Captain Owen Smyth’s name has been withdrawn from the Honour Roll on page 4.  When war broke out he enlisted in the AIF, but was later rejected, but retained as a full-time training officer for the reinforcements of the 13th Field Training Battery at Woodside.  He has since been re-examined and passed as fit, but will not be permitted to re-join the ranks of the AIF until posted for duty overseas.  Under the circumstance Captain Owen Smyth expressed his wish that his name be withdrawn from the Honour Roll.
