Burra Town Council, 6 November

Cr Harvey said he understood if the School Committee paid half the cost the Education Department would pay the other half cost of repairing the school tennis courts.  He moved the Town Council pay half the costs.  Cr Fisher seconded.

The Mayor queried whether any boy or girl in the town was eligible to play on the courts.

Cr Harvey said that recently a basketball association was formed and competitive matches held on the school courts.  He was given to understand that competitive tennis would also be held.

Cr Kellaway was sympathetic, but wary of setting a precedent for other sports.  Also it did not embrace the Primary School.  Council should carry out repairs at cost price.

Cr Kellaway moved an amendment that the Courts be repaired at cost price.

The amendment was carried on the casting vote of the Mayor.

RSL Fathers’ Assoc. wrote asking if it had been decided to form a branch in Burra.

Cr carpenter moved the Council call a meeting to form a branch.  Cr Harvey seconded.  Carried.

The Hospitals Assoc. notified the Council that its contribution for the Burra Hospital for the year would be £170.

Messrs Pengilly & Co. submitted prices and designs for an honour roll for Mayors & Town Clerks.  Cr Kellaway moved acceptance of design 31A for £17-2-0.  Cr Bevan seconded.  Carried.

Lieut. Col. Shaw advised that members of VDC, VSD & Air Raid Wardens were to be placed on the Reserve List, as the danger of invasion was receding.  He suggested Dr Steele be appointed honorary liaison officer between VDC etc. & the Council.

A light is to be placed over the creek bed in Burra North, as the [foot]bridge was being repaired.

Fuss’s crossing is to be built up.  [Does this refer to the St Just St Ford?]

Cr Fisher reported that the Bon Accord Bridge was condemned for the use of heavy traffic.

The Town Clerk said repairs were in the hands of the Department.  As the bridge-making plant was in town Cr Fisher moved a letter be sent to the Department stressing the matter.  Carried.

A letter will be sent to the SAR asking the station road be repaired.
