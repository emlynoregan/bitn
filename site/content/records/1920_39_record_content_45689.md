The President reported that though the committee had been at work 12 months there was not much to show on the ground, but matters had been put on a firm footing.  The Hanson Institute was now a member of the Institutes Assoc. of SA.  The lowest price obtained was £275 fully lined, ceiled and with a jarrah floor.  At present they were in credit £175.  Re-elected were President M.J. Marchant and Secretary G. Pattullo.
