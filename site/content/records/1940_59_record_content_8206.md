Pte P.D. Ogilvie’s Military Medal.

During the attack on the Damour defences on 6 July the attackers were held up by strong machine-gun fire and then the enemy was shaken by mortar fire.  Seeing the enemy was slightly demoralised Private Ogilvie took the initiative and ran forward, firing his light machine-gun from the hip.  He completed the demoralisation of the enemy and on the arrival of the rest of the platoon the surviving enemy surrendered without further resistance.  This action undoubtedly saved the platoon many casualties.  He continued to show the same courage until seriously wounded in the head.

Pte Ogilvie (28) is the son of Mr & Mrs W.D. Ogilvie of Booborowie and is one of three brothers who have enlisted.

One, Gunner Ogilvie, was killed at Tobruk and Pte Irvine Ogilvie is now with his unit, having been wounded at Tobruk.  The family went to Booborowie from Moe in Victoria some 15 years ago.  Pte P.D. Ogilvie and Pte I.S. Ogilvie were partners in a farm next to their father’s property at Booborowie.  The late Gunner Stewart Ogilvie was employed at the Globe Timber Mills at Broken Hill when he enlisted.  The last news of Pte P. Duncan Ogilvie is that he was seriously wounded in the head in the first week of July and was in hospital.
