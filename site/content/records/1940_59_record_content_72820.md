Attempted Shooting

James Maxwell Little, a shearer of Mt Bryan was charged with unlawfully assaulting Geovanni Mancini of Burra North and shooting at Audrey Mavis Little with intent to maim or disfigure, and has been remanded to Adelaide Jail.  Little has been separated from his wife since February and noticed her car in her mother’s yard on Sunday.  He and Mancini were out driving together.  He saw Mrs Little leave with the car and asked Mancini to follow it to see where it went.  After getting petrol at the Burra Motor Co., Mrs Little took the Adelaide Road.  When Mancini refused to follow, Little held a rifle in his back and forced him to drive at up to 80 m.p.h.  A few miles down the track they passed Mrs Little and Mancini was then forced to stop and lift the bonnet and hail Mrs Little as she approached.  She did not stop and when the car passed her further on, she knew something was wrong.  She speeded up and as she tried to pass the other car she heard a rifle shot.  Five miles further on she came to a house, where she phoned police.  After the shot Mancini grabbed the rifle because he knew the ejector did not work and the spent shell would have to be removed with a knife or similar.  There was a struggle and Mancini drew a knife and forced Little out of the car and returned to Burra.  It was found that the bullet had passed through the offside rear mudguard of Mrs Little’s car.  Little was arrested yesterday by Detective O’Malley and Senior Constable Kewell, at a farm at Mt Bryan.
