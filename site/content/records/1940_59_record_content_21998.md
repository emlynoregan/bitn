An Exhibition of Stud Rams is mooted for the centenary celebrations.  This was suggested by Mr Andrew Bartholomaeus, Stud Stock Inspector for Elder, Smith & Co. Ltd.  Even though the celebrations are a bit late in the year for the rams to be at their best, committee members feel sure that district breeders will co-operate to make the exhibition a success.
