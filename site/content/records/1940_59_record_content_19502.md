Obituary.  R.M. McBride has died aged 84.  He was a son of the late J.M. McBride the noted pioneer pastoralist.  The deceased was involved in the pastoral industry all his life and the first property he bought was Fingerpost Station some miles east of Burra.  Later he was interested in ‘The Gap’ Station now owned by Mr Andrew Tennant and also in Devonborough Downs in the northeast.  He also bought lucerne land at Booborowie when the Booborowie Estate was subdivided.  He had interests too in WA, the main one being Tarmoola Pastoral Company at Leonora and the other in North Danalup district where he maintained a Suffolk sheep stud with which he was a successful exhibitor at many Royal Perth Shows.  During his life he disposed of most of his SA properties and at the time of his death retained only part of the old Beefacres Estate at Gilles Plains.  He was taken ill while travelling to Leonora and he intended to visit the Ram Sales in Perth.  He returned to Toorak, but did not recover.  He is survived by a widow, four daughters and two sons.  He was buried at Burra Cemetery.

[Robert Martin McBride born 26 October 1860 Lostwithiel (Burra): died 24 October 1944 Rose Park, residence Toorak.]
