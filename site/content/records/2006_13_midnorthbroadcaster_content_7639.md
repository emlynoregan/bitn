Don Pfitzner of Eudunda Oval Facilities Working Party writes to take issue with E.B. Hawke who had questioned the health of democracy.  He says Mr Hawkeâ€™s figures are incorrect and his remarks both sarcastic and offensive.  He defends the planning and consultation processes that have led up to this stage of the proposal.
