Kooringa

Mr Oakford, Kooringa.

Pupils present when inspected, 27 (1 destitute); pupils attending school, 59 (1 destitute); state of schoolroom, good; general discipline, good.

Mrs Oakford, Kooringa.

Pupils present when inspected, 21 (1 destitute); pupils attending the school, 46 (1 destitute); state of schoolroom, good; general discipline, good.

Mr Stephens, Kooringa.

Pupils present when inspected, 72 (1 destitute); pupils attending school 149 (1 destitute); state of schoolroom, good; general discipline, good.  Evening school, 21 pupils.

The Second Inspector stated that Mr Stephens intended applying for a pupil teacher.  He had a person in view who would be very suitable for the situation, and he deserved encouragement, as he had got together so large a school, and already engaged the services of his wife and sister.

It was mentioned in the course of conversation that the Board would in every instance require that the pupil-teacher receive the full benefit of the extra allowance, his services being considered a sufficient compensation to the master for any instruction imparted to him.
