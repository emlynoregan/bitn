Criminal Sittings, Adelaide, 1 April.

Woodman & Lehman pleaded guilty and asked for mercy which was not forthcoming.  They received one year each on the pig stealing charge and Lehman got two years for stealing the two sheep.  [It is not stated whether the sentences were concurrent.]

Byrne has pleaded not guilty to the arson attempt at Drew & Crewes and the trial is expected today.  [Correction in paper of 10 April: A. Woodman got 2years not 1 year.]
