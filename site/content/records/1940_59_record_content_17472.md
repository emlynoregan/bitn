H.J. Stevens of ‘Station House’ Burra North writes the story of the plate left by Flinders at Memory Cove, but it adds nothing to solve the puzzle of how a copy of it got to be at the Burra School and indeed he believes it to be the original, though the earlier report had stated the original was in the Art Gallery in Adelaide.
