Letter.  ACI Albert Sampson writes from Singapore.  He says that after 13 months service overseas, he has just had leave that enabled him to visit Malacca and Johore.  He spends much of the letter writing about betel nuts, rubber and oil palms, before going on to tell of his visit to Malacca and Kuala Lumpur.  In Malacca he danced with two AIF nurses from SA: Sisters Betty Pyman of Hawker and Nelly Keats of Dulwich.
