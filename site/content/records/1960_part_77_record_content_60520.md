Burra RSL.  President B. Kotz, Annual Report for 1971

There has been a lack of support from some of the elected committee members.  In nine monthly meetings one committeeman did not attend at all and another only once.  The Anzac Day and Armistice Day services were held as usual.  The annual dinner was a success and so were the badge days conducted by the Ladiesâ€™ Auxiliary, who also ran a successful trading table for Legacy.  Mr Ron Wuttke, who had been a solid supporter, was given a public farewell.  Three members died during the year: H. Brown, R. Kellock and R. Motherall.
