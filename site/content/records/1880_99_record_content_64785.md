A Bolt.  Last Sunday when Ah Chin was visiting his cousins in Ayers St the horse in his vehicle bolted just as he was about to chain the wheel.  Fortunately it negotiated a number of corners without damage and was finally stopped near Charley Grow’s stables by a lad named Lines, who delivered it to the driver who ‘thankee Jack welly muchee’.
