Accidents.  On Saturday there were two more victims of the Black Springs Road.  A car, driven by Charles N. Nilson of Broken Hill, skidded and overturned near Nankivell’s.  He was bruised, his wife suffered minor abrasions and his son sustained a dislocated shoulder.  The car ended up with its four wheels in the air and was badly damaged.

At 10.30 p.m. the same day Mr Ray Rollison of Adelaide, who was riding a motorcycle with a pillion passenger, swerved to avoid a rabbit about 16 miles south of Burra.  The machine dropped into a four foot deep creek and the riders were thrown off.  Mr Rollison needed stitches in a lacerated thumb and the passenger had minor injuries.

Fire.  Mr R.T.F. Rogers was badly burnt at Koonoona near Hanson on Thursday when he tripped and fell into the fire while getting through a fence to battle a blaze on the property.

Fire.  Two fires continue to burn to the east of Burra.  Military aid is being sought, but much red tape has first to be cut through.  On Friday Military equipment was pulled out of the fire near Morgan when it was thought the blaze was out on that front.  This withdrew 60-80 me and equipment.  The fire at Oakbank has been the most serious.  Most of that station has been burnt out and stock losses are high: perhaps total.  The fire seems to have started on the Lilydale-Quondong boundary and raced part way along the boundary fence before crossing into Oakbank.  Two strips of fire then burnt from the northwest corner to the southeast corner.  Strips burnt each side of the homestead, but it survived.  The fire then went into part of Pine Valley North and along the Morgan Vale boundary.  The picture is then vague, but with a sudden change of wind to the southwest, the fire entered Mutooroo by the north and burnt for some miles before the wind changed to east.

The other fire started first near Morgan and entered this district by the Gluepot-Balah boundary.  It burnt Gluepot, consuming most of the scrub and feed.  It then entered part of Bungunnia and threatened Udale Station and Sampson’s Well, but that was saved.  It burnt along the south boundary of Parcoola and Canegrass and burnt Yubalia (part of Canegrass.)  The fire then turned north and burnt along the southern boundary of Lord’s Well and the eastern boundary of Canegrass.  During the week it went northwest along the Lord’s Well and Canegrass and Morgan Vale boundaries.

At present a break 15 miles long has been burnt along the Canegrass and Lord’s Well Mail Track and the fire is being held.  The fear is it may break through and exhausted fire fighters need a rest.  Another danger is that the fire, which is going from Canopus into the south part of Morgan Vale, may get around the top end of the Canegrass-Lord’s Well Break, if the wind changes to southerly.  It would then threaten the north end of Lord’s Well and Pine Valley.

Some equipment has had to be pulled back to Burra itself, where the fire siren has sounded twice during the week.

Rex Warnes at Koomooloo is charting the progress and all authentic reports must be made to him.  A conservative estimate is that 1,000 square miles have been burnt, but the real figure must be greater.
