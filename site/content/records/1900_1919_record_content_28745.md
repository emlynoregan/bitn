Cr Hardy said there had been bitter complaints about the unsatisfactory way in which scavenging was being carried out.  He moved that the inspector be instructed to see that the work of the scavenger was carried out according to the contract he signed and that failure to do so be reported to the Board.  Carried unanimously.
