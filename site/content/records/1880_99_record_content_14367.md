Burra Show.

The dry weather and four other shows on the same day dampened people’s ardour and the increased entrance fee did not help.  Perhaps with hindsight it would have been better to reduce prize money.  The day was hot and the grounds dusty.

[These introductory comments seem to sit uneasily with the next statements!]

The attendance was very large and the gate money we believe a record.

Sheep and poultry are the mainstay of the show.

Implements are becoming fewer, though Henderson & Co. had highly recommended items on display.

Pigs and draught stock were few, but good.

Cattle were few as usual and wheat was good.

In the large hall there was a sorry sight with too few entries.  Flowers were down due to the hot windy day.

P. Lane’s saddlery was a credit to him.

T.F. Bentley’s colonial wood cabinet was beautifully carved and the school entries reflected credit on both teachers and students.

The prize list is printed.
