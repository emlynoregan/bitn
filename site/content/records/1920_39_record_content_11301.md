Ironmine Methodist Memorial Schoolroom was opened on 28 July, the eve of Violet Day.

A large crowd gathered in splendid weather.  The idea was born four years ago as a suggestion from Mr W.H. Lloyd.  The appeal met with immediate success.  The hall stands to the memory not only of the two lads who fell, but their many comrades.  The late Pte James Flower and Pte George Williams were both members of the church and Sunday school.  Rev. D.B. Bridgwood who performed the ceremony was pastor during the period of the war.  He was assisted by the present pastor Rev. E.M. Ingamells and by Ensign H.R. Heathwood of the Salvation Army and Rev. Edmund Smith of Kooringa.  The committee was headed by Mrs E. Jettner, President and Miss Annie Morgan as Secretary.  The building could be opened debt free and with Â£40 in hand towards furnishings.  The contractors were F.M. Pearce and T.H. Woollacott.  Rev. Ingamells and Rev. Smith spoke and the former handed the key to Rev. Bridgwood who also spoke before opening the room.

Inside there were ceremonies to unveil three memorial windows.

Mrs James Flower unveiled a memorial window to her son Ray J.C. Flower who died of wounds in France 6 July 1918.

Mrs D. Williams unveiled a similar window to her son George A. Williams who died of wounds in France 21 November 1917.

Mrs George Williams, widow of the above, then unveiled the window to all those who served in the war.  This window is a gift of the scholars of the Sunday school.

The crowd then moved to Leighton Hall for a knife and fork tea followed by a semi-sacred concert.  The hall was decorated with violets.  United choirs of the Kooringa and Redruth Churches trained by G.E. Dane and conducted by J. Murison with Miss Trix Pearce at the piano provided the music with solo items by Miss N. Herbert, Miss B. Woollacott, Miss E. James, Miss A. Wicklein, Mrs H. Jennison, Mr J. Murison, Mr H. Jennison, Mr R. Fuss and Mr W.H. Spier.  Supper followed.
