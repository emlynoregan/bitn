Burra Town Council, 5 February.

The Premier’s Dept. writes that Civil Defence Committees were to be reorganised and in future there would be one under the DC and one under the Town Council.  G. Powell, District Council Clerk, would therefore resign his position on the present committee and reorganisation of it would follow.

Resolved to hold a joint meeting of the Council and the present committee.

Further discussion of the signing of the agreement with the AWU was followed by a decision to sign.

Cr Reed moved the gate and fence across the road near the late Mrs Short’s property be removed.  Carried, though the Mayor could see no reason for it: the fence and gate had been in place 40 years without apparent harm.

The part of the road leading to the Oddfellows Lodge to be tarred.
