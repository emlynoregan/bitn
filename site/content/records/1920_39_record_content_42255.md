Red Cross AGM 7 June.  The report for 1931-32 by President Mrs F.R. Wigley said the jumble sale on 21 August 1931 had netted £32-11-6 and thanked Mr F.R. Wigley for donating the hall.

‘At the September meeting held on Tuesday, February 1st 1931 [sic] it was decided to send £15 to the Royal Institution for the Blind.’  £10 was sent to Angorichina.  At Christmas £3 was sent to each of Burra, Keswick, Bedford Park and Parkside Mental Hospitals.  This year they had 42 members and last year 30.  All retiring officers were re-elected.
