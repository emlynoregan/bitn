The Simpson Family held a reunion at the Burra Town Hall on 6 April. It was organised by Mrs Daphne Cook and Mrs Dawn Dawes.  Five generations of the family attended.  About 100 people were present.  The first Simpsons were farmers in the district in the 1870s.  A previous reunion had been held in 1982.  Most of the visitors wore period costume.
