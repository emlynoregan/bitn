Accident.  Melva Woollacott, the young daughter of Mr & Mrs W.J. Woollacott of Aberdeen, was struck by a car at the intersection at Best Place on Sunday afternoon.  It is thought her head collided with a mudguard and she was thrown under the car which was driven by a stranger.  Fortunately the car stopped before the wheels passed over her.  She sustained a fractured skull and concussion, but is now doing well.
