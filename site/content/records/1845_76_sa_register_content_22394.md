Kooringa News, 14 October

Obituary.  Mrs Thomas Read, wife of a shepherd employed by Messrs Duffield & Porter, died suddenly on Monday 12 October.  She had recently been confined and appeared to be doing well, but on the sixth day she was seized with an hysterical fit – a disease she had suffered from for some years – and suddenly died.

[Thomas Read/Reid married Mary Evers 28 March 1862 at Logans Gap.  Mary Read died 12 October 1868 at Kooringa, residence Logans Gap aged 28.  The child was William Evers Reid born 8 October 1868 at Logans Gap and died 9 November 1868 at Logans Gap.]

At the inquest conducted by W.H. Challoner JP at the Miners’ Arms, Dr William Henry Dashwood said that at the post mortem he had found the heart in a state of hypertrophy and the liver was fatty and enlarged.  The cause of death was an ‘effusion into the pericardium, consequent upon an old standing heart affection’ and probably accelerated by recent inflammation.
