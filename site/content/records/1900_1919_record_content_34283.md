Kooringa Methodist Church.  The meeting on 22 April considered the options.  The repair of the existing church would cost £1,000 and a new church £3,000.  No one supported repairs.  £323 was immediately promised from 170 donors ranging from 6d to £50.  Before the meeting dispersed two further promises of £150 and £100 were made to bring the total to £573, since when further sums have brought it to £660.
