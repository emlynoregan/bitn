10 December.

Charles Klaffus was charged on the information of his wife, Matilda Klaffus, with assaulting Agnes Frahm aged 14, daughter of the complainant, on 8 December.

Matilda Klaffus.

On Sunday morning between 5 and 6 a.m. my husband came to my house, got undressed and got into bed.  He immediately began swearing at my daughter and me and when I got up he threatened to burn down the house.  He wanted to strike my eldest boy aged 9 and then struck me on the face.  (The bruise showed prominently at the hearing.)  I had a little bottle in my hand and struck him on the forehead, in order to save my life.  He tried to put me in a tub of water, beating me all the while.  I cried out for help and my daughter came and hit him over the head with something.  [A broomstick.]  He then caught me and threw me down.  I got away and he struck my daughter.  She got away and joined me at Mrs Nankivell’s.  He later said he wanted his pipe and she went back with me to find it.  He took up a large stone and threw it at her.  She fell down senseless.

Mrs Bullen saw the stone throwing and the girl fall.  Agnes has not yet been able to get up.  She is in bed and is constantly vomiting blood.  He said he was sober, but I couldn’t say whether he was or not.

Rosa Bullen gave evidence confirming the stone throwing.

Klaffus was remanded for three days on two sureties of £25 each and of himself in £50.

[There is a great deal more evidence reported, but this is the essence of it.]
