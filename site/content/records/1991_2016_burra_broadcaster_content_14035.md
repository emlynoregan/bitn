Letter.  Des Woolley writes apologising for any unintended slur to Mr Rossi and his team – but transferring the blame to a press release by a ‘vote seeking, drum beating, chest thumping politician’ which had used words like ‘finished’ and ‘completed’ with ‘other than their literal english [sic] meanings’.
