Elder, Smith & Co. yarded 19,660 sheep on Friday and sold 18,183 of them.  The total included 16,000 lambs and it is doubtful if so many lambs have been yarded anywhere in SA for many years.

Top price went the Estate of G.S. Melrose ‘Willogoleche’ Hallett with 83/9 for a line of 393 1½-year-old ewes shorn in August.  [Quotations of other prices are on page 10.]
