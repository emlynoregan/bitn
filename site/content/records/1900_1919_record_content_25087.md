Football.  On 6 October the annual dance of the Aberdeen Football Club was held at the Institute.  Despite 250 invitations only 40 couples attended, which will make it hard for the committee to break even.  Dancing went till 2 a.m.  A presentation was made to ‘August’ Lomman, Captain of the team for his good work and on the occasion of his marriage.
