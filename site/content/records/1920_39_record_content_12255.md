Burra Town Council, 19 November

The mayor reported buying a good horse for Council for £30.

Cr Kellaway was welcomed back after his absence.

The Mayor said despite the Commissioner’s directive the public were not being allowed to use the station telephone.

Mr Lott was building a house on Paxton Terrace on a lot with a corner cut off by a small piece of land belonging to Council.  He enquired whether he could buy it from them.  Council will enquire into it.

The wire is reported broken on Carey’s Bridge.

The question of parking space for cars on Fridays was raised.  A Council block behind Drew & Crewes was suggested.

The Mayor complained that the man getting most money from the Fire Brigade was frequently out of town.  The Mayor said the money was being spent (£160) and the men were not there.  The Fire Brigade Board will be asked that there be one permanent man and the rest be volunteers.

The electric light at the Black Bridge is to be replaced by one on the corner of Paxton Terrace and Welsh Place.  An extra light was voted for Miss Geake’s corner in Queen St.

St Mary’s Strawberry Fete at the Institute on Friday was a wonderful success and raised £200.

The Scriptural Instruction in State Schools League held a meeting in the Kooringa Methodist Schoolroom with Rev. Edmund Smith presiding.  He strongly supported the League’s aims.  Rev. R. Taylor, general secretary of the League spoke.  The league was in favour of:

Selected non-sectarian scripture lessons by state school teachers.

Ministers or accredited substitutes to teach children of their own denomination during school hours.
