A Bolt.  A horse attached to Domenick Pizzo’s cart in Paradise bolted on Monday.  Almost immediately the cart was left behind on a fence, but the horse continued down Kingston St and across the bridge before taking to the footpath at E.J. Harris’s where it narrowly missed Mr F.J. Packard.  It turned into Chapel St, but on attempting to enter the lane behind the Commercial Hotel the dangling harness got caught on a post and the adventure came to a halt.
