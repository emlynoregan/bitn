She was the second daughter Margaret Helen (Maggie) of the late Mr & Mrs Boulton of Kooringa.  All her life she had been closely associated with Methodism both in the Bible Christian and later in the Kooringa Methodist Church.  She leaves a widower, two daughters and four sons: Alice Mrs Nicholas, Belle Mrs C.G. Phillips of Broken Hill, Eddie & Lex R. (both of Kooringa) and Henry & Peter (both of Broken Hill).  There are several grandchildren.
