Obituary.  Mary A. Rogers died 16 May at Kooringa.  She was the youngest daughter of the late Richard Rogers of Gum Creek.  [Not to be confused with Mary Ann Rogers nee Eustice who died 13 March 1926: this was Miss Mary Ann Rogers born 13 January 1852.]

Miss M.A. Rogers died on Sunday at Welsh Place Kooringa aged 74.  She was the third and youngest daughter of the late Mr & Mrs R. Rogers of Gum Creek and was born at Burra in 1852.  She was educated in Adelaide and returned to Gum Creek after her parentsâ€™ deaths to keep house for her brother.  When he married she went to Pt Augusta, but later returned to Burra.  She was a keen gardener.  Her brothers are Mr J.H. Rogers of Aberdeen (late of Hanson) and Mr T. Rogers of Hanson.
