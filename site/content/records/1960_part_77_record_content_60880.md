Obituary.  Mr Matthew Francis Carmody died on Sunday morning at his Leighton home when he was crushed between the tip-tray and the chassis of a truck.  The raised tray had been propped with heavy timber and he was greasing the rear under section of the vehicle when the timber slipped sideways and there had been a sufficient loss of hydraulic pressure for the tray to descend.  Two nephews and his son Patrick discovered the accident at approximately 12.45 p.m.  He is survived by his widow and children: Patrick, Mary, Michael and Helen.

[Born 1 July 1919 Leighton: died 23 April 1972 Burra according to SA Deaths CD.]
