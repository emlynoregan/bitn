A number of stores and well-constructed rooms and lofty cottages form the Mining Association township of Cooringa [sic] where one may see the walls of the most spacious hotel yet undertaken in the province and a Wesleyan Chapel is also being built, together with rooms for a day and Sabbath School.

The Bon Accord, or Sydney Co.’s Mine as it is usually called, is being explored, but without much success at present.  Indications are said to be good.  A large and substantial police station and stables have just been completed for the Government.

Editor.  Since this has been received we have reports of the falling in of several shafts, but fortunately with no loss of life.  But there is no official news.
