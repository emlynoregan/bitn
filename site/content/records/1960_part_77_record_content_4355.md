Burra Amateur Swimming Club was formed at a meeting of about 30 people on 31 October.  It was decided to disband the Burra & District Swimming Pool Committee and form the Burra & District Amateur Swimming Club.  H.J. Topsfield was elected first President.  The Swimming Pool Committee had a credit balance of £355.

Also elected were: Patron, G. Stanley Hawker; Vice-President, A.L. Beinke; Secretary, Allan Ireland and Treasurer, K. Hicks.

The Club will apply for affiliation with the SA Amateur Swimming Association.

A minute of appreciation was recorded for the untiring efforts of the Secretary and Treasurer of the Swimming Pool Committee Mr Ted Orchard.

The report of the Swimming Pool Committee said:

The pool was officially opened by Mr G. Stanley Hawker 31 January 1960.

Voluntary hours given to the completion of the pool were 1,154.

The formation of a swimming club affiliated with the Amateur Swimming Association would allow swimmers’ times to be recognised and would stimulate competitive swimming.

Special tribute must be paid to Mr R.G. Jeffery for his untiring effort in the initial stages of the construction of the pool and to Mr Ted Orchard for his efficiency as Secretary-Treasurer.
