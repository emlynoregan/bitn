‘Endless Praise’ is a gospel music group that has been travelling in Australia and overseas for seven years to bring joy and satisfaction to their listeners. They bring a warmth and sincerity to their performances that has kept them going and kept the donations coming in that allow it to do so.  They will be appearing in the Burra Anglican Church on 31 August and they would encourage people of all ages to come and enjoy a night of top gospel entertainment in a performance with a quality of presentation rarely witnessed in Australia.
