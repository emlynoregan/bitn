SAR & NSW Railways are competing for the Broken Hill holiday traffic.  NSW is upgrading the Silver City Comet with better cooking and refrigeration.  SA by contrast offers a mad scramble for tea with sandwiches or pies and pasties at Terowie and Riverton.  A buffet car is used on the Pt Pirie train and SAR might consider a dining car on the Broken Hill express, or at least a buffet car.
