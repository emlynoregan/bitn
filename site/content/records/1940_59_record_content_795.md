R.T. Bowles writes as Hon. Secretary of the Burra Progress Assoc. in response to Council’s umbrage at their recent letter.  Their letter to Council is printed and he says they were perfectly within their charter to send the letter, which was dated 21 November 1939 and acknowledged on 21 November 1939.  They wrote again on 8 February 1940 as no advice on any action taken had been received.  On 22 February they were advised ‘all necessary work mentioned in your letter of 16 November last has received the attention of the Council.’  The Assoc. has 95 financial members and the second letter was prompted by the lack of any reply to the first.
