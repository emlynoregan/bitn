W.R. Ridgway asked what the year’s income was.  The Town Clerk said it was not possible to answer that without the books to hand, but the deficit at the end of the year was expected to be about £270.  Income was about £550 from rates £70 from Dog Licences and about £20 from fines.

P. Lane asked how the money was spent.

The Town Clerk gave the figures for each ward, but did not otherwise break the spending down into items.

Crs Pinch and O’Leary both said their object would be to minimise expenditure.

The expected receipts for next year would be about £700.

[Which would allow minimal for spending considering the £300 in bonds due and the £270 overdraft.]

P. Killicoat said he was in favour of continuing to assess by annual rental values instead of unimproved land values.

W.T. Rabbich thought the Council had bungled a great deal and in particular in accepting £50 subsidy for main roads due to an error in the length of them recorded by the Government.  They got £50 for 5 miles when Unley got £500 for 9 miles!

Mr Davies had not prepared a speech.

W.H. Hardy [who was in general remarkably conciliatory] ‘thought that a change of personnel of the Council necessary’ and he favoured careful economy.  He was for unimproved land value as the basis of the assessment.  The main loser in the change would be SAMA who ‘receive money and return nothing for it.’

A. Miller came forward as a candidate for East Ward.
