Vandalism.  [As printed the report is somewhat confused.]  S.G. Pickering broke his car’s axle on Flagstaff Hill on the night of 16 March and had to walk in with his suitcase and other valuables.  Returning in the morning, he found the car stripped of everything movable including tools.  The windscreen was smashed and the radiator dented and two new tyres worth £30 were slashed.  On Monday two lads were charged with the offence of damaging the car and were charged £5 damages.
