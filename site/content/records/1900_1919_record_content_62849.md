RSL Social.   The RSL put on a social at the Institute for members of local patriotic societies on Thursday evening in appreciation of the work done to support enlisted men.  It was a lovely cool evening, the hall had been lavishly decorated and the seating was equal to the large attendance.  Dr Steele announced there would be no speeches [other than his of course] â€“ not even one from Mr Crewes.  Mr Crewes has laryngitis and he professionally forbade him to speak.  A series of vocal and instrumental items was provided.  Tea and coffee and supper followed.  Mr Crewes did manage in the end to move the vote of thanks.  Dancing to midnight followed.
