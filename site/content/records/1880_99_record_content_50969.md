Rifle Match.  A friendly shoot on Wednesday morning saw Pt Pirie MR 438 defeat Burra MR 381.

Burra Co. MR was inspected by Brigade Major Stuart and Sgt-Major De Passey (from Staff Office) [De Pass√©?] on 30 August.  The result was highly satisfactory and an improvement on last year in both shooting and drill.  Capt. J.A. Watt was commended as reliable and painstaking.  A successful Military Ball followed in the evening, at the Institute.  Refreshments were taken at midnight and dancing continued to the early hours.
