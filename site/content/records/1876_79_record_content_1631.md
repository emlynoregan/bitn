Editorial Review of 1876

For S.A.

Boucaut's policy of railway extension was introduced.

Pt Augusta-Government Gums railway seen as a priority as it opens vast areas of pastoral country

Hallett and North West Bend (Morgan) lines are well under way

The Port Pirie to Gladstone line is open

SA was seen at the Philadelphia Exhibition

Emigration from the UK has been successful

1876 was one of driest years on record

Mining depressed by low copper price, but Burra looking promising

The South Burra Burra Mine has work temporarily suspended as it needs further capital for development, but also looks promising.

Rabbits remain a major problem

War fears in Europe have resulted in defence discussion for the colony, but little action apart from formation of some rifle clubs.

For Burra

The hospital is moving to the old Burra Hotel to be open very soon following repairs and alterations.

A Lodge Room has been added to the Institute

A new school costing nearly Â£7,000 is under construction.

A local paper has been established.

Town needs include

a.	Trees

b.	A recreation ground

c.	More and better housing in Kooringa
