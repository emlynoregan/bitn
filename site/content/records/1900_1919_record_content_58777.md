The Great District Fire Coronial Enquiry.

I.J. Warnes JP acted as coroner at the enquiry held at the Booborowie Hotel last Saturday.

The coroner was anxious to establish the cause of the fire, which started on Mr J. O’Dea’s farm.  If it could be shown that rabbit poison started the fire as alleged then the Government should be approached to have its manufacture prohibited.

John Charles O’Dea, farmer of H. of Ayers.

He described the morning’s activities of 24 January.  He described his discovery of the fire in his haystack and the efforts made to extinguish and then confine it.  He believed the fire started about 9.30 and that dogs had brought dead rabbits to the stack and that his stallion had trodden on the entrails causing the fire.  He had not used rabbit poison himself, but it had been laid on Mr Barker’s land.  He had lost 12-15 tons of hay, ½ ton of super, 5 acres of grass and a few posts.  He was not insured.  He had no problems with his neighbours.

On the night of the fire he told Mr Symons to take Mr Barker’s sheep out of his [O’Dea’s] paddock as it was the only feed he had and they would have skinned it out.

Cross-examined he said if he had concentrated on stopping the fire spreading to ‘Coralinga’ he might have been successful, but at the cost of his own house etc.  Later he admitted he had not tried to stop the fire from spreading before trying to save the stack.

Harold James O’Dea gave generally corroborating evidence, but did not know how the fire started.  He had no chance to beat out the fire: it was already too strong.

Thomas Symons.  The first thing done was to save the sheep.  He couldn’t have stopped the fire if he had gone straight to it.  He had no theory on the fire’s origin.  He had no problem with the O’Deas and never knew of poisoned rabbits causing fires, but had known S.A.P. to burst into flames when open.  He was sure a horse treading on entrails would not cause a fire.

Others gave inconclusive evidence.

John Williams of Hanson had laid rabbit poison.  He said 2 lb of S.A.P. was mixed with 1 gallon of water and sufficient pollard to the consistency of bread dough.  Friction could cause a fire in an empty S.A.P. tin when it was quite dry, but he could think of no conditions which would make the mixed poison ignite.  He gave further details of his activities.

John Barker said S.A.P. had been used for 15 years and it had never caused a fire and he considered it absolutely safe.  Poisoned rabbits usually died in their burrows.

The coroner then said he thought they should adjourn to get the professional opinion of Dr Hargreaves, the Government Analyst, but he would be guided by the jury.

The enquiry was then adjourned to 11 February at Redruth.
