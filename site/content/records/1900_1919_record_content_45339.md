Burra Town Council.  Inspection of the Town.

Mine Bridge – the proposed [foot] bridge can be erected for about £20.

Railway Road – this part of the main road to the western town boundary is in a bad state and need re-metalling.  [This description suggests they were talking about Copperhouse St.]

Railway Gate – the Railways’ fence encroaches 15’ onto the roadway and the Railway Commissioner should be asked to move the fence and fill in the road as needed.

Mt Bryan Road – needs attention north from Drew & Crewes Store.

Watt Rd – a shockingly bad main road, which needs re-metalling for its whole length following the flood.

Killicoat Rd – fair, needs patching near the boundary near Mr Killicoat’s gate.  [i.e. the road to the east from Redruth.]

Main Roads in Kooringa – fair, tar paved from the post office to Eyes and Crowles.

Black Bridge – to be tar dressed.
