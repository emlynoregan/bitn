North Ward Election Meeting

Royal Exchange Hotel, 13 November.  Attendance was very small.

Cr Rabbich thought on the whole they had done well and in the last year had spent in the North Ward £457-19-10 and estimated they would have next year £275.  Some thought that Aberdeen had been favoured over Redruth, but this was not so.

Cr Rayner agreed: they had spent £240-8-2 in Redruth and £235-11-8 in Aberdeen.

C.W. Brown has agreed to stand for Council, but little of significance was raised or discussed.
