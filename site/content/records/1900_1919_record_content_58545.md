Burra Cheer-up Society.

There was a welcome home social on 15 January for Ptes F. Wheatley, T. Harrap, L. McGowan & Tpr W. Dow.  Pte Humphris, brother of C. Humphris, arrived later.

On 17 January the Ladies’ band welcomed Pte Hilary Fuss and Sgt Lewis, a returned 3rd Light Horseman who is visiting Burra.

‘Demos’ writes re the Soldiers’ Memorial.  The Hanson District Council has decided not to support a central memorial, but will the small number from there produce anything really worthy?

[The writer is all in favour of swallowing a little local pride in order to produce something really worthy of ‘the boys’.]
