The Prime Minister in Burra (Mr Hughes)

On 28 August the Prime Minister, Mr Hughes, passed through Burra on the train as he was returning from England.  Mr Crewes arranged for the train to stop for 10 minutes so the Prime Minister could be greeted and thanked for his work for the Commonwealth.  Returned soldiers lined up, led by Majors Kenyon & Steele and Mr Broderick and Mr Dixon Thompson carried the PM to a lorry outside the gates.  The Mayor welcomed the PM and Sir Joseph Cook.  Dr Steele spoke for the RSL.  The Mayor presented the PM with a framed photo of the Ladies’ band. [The Band was present and played for the occasion.]  Mr Hughes responded, especially expressing his gratitude to Australia’s servicemen.  Sir Joseph Cook also spoke about the care for Australian War Graves overseas.  Mr Hughes asked that the children be given a half-holiday.
