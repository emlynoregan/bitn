BCS Staff Changes

Mr Jeremy Slater and Mrs Lynne Raw will share the contract to replace Mr Geoff Bayly who is on six months long service leave.  Miss Mary Woollacott has filled the Community Library Aide position left vacant by the resignation of Miss Leanne May and Mrs Jean Roberts, who agreed to fill the position of Experienced Library Aide for the holidays, will continue until the Education Department completes its rationalisation of ancillary staff positions.

Mrs Liz Pritchard will take most of the primary class aide responsibilities previously held by Miss Woollacott and will be assisted by Miss Buick and Mrs Hoskins.
