Catherine Barker, daughter of Peggy & Tony Barker of Baldina Station, will give her final Honour Recital in Piano Performance at Elder Hall in Adelaide University on Friday 17 March at 6.30 p.m.  She began studying with Jack Coombs in Adelaide when aged 8, until his untimely death four years later.  She continued with Mary Warnecke and won several scholarships.  In 1993 she was the first recipient in SA of the AMEB Fellowship under the tutelage of Noreen Stokes and in that year completed her Bachelor of Music (Performance) and Bachelor of Commerce, both at the University of Adelaide.
