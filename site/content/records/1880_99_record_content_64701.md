Editorial on the Burra Waterworks.

The lease runs out at the end of the year and the Town Council is seeking to make arrangements to wait on the Commissioner of Public Works with a view to getting both the capital and the rate of interest reduced.  It is monstrous the way we have been taxed in the past and have proved ourselves an exceedingly patient lot of residents otherwise ‘we would have woke up’ [sic] to the iniquitous charges imposed on us.  An effort must now be made to get the lease under more favourable circumstances.  Some 14 years ago the Waterworks, which some say were never needed, cost £8,072, which sum was a most unreasonable not to say unfair valuation.  For some time the Government took it over, then subsequently the Council did and were charged 5% for the privilege.  Now there is depreciation in the Waterworks as there is in other things, yet the Government pretends otherwise.  Even if we allow that the works cost £8,072 14 years ago, can it be imagined they are worth that today?  Of Course not.  Yet only recently the Government, when asked, put a price of £8,072 on the Waterworks, despite the fact that the engines, pipes and all else connected with it are decaying.  The pipes especially will have to be replaced in the near future.  Then the interest charge is higher than for any other similar public works in the colony – three times that for the Beetaloo Waterworks and the State Bank will lend money at 4½%.  The reduction asked for by the deputation is very reasonable, but we question the wisdom of specifying the amount of capital reduction, for if granted any future request will elicit the response that you got what you asked for, now be satisfied.  But the interest should be below 4%, as the works are entirely for the public.  It is to be hoped the deputation will thoroughly consider the matter.

In the last 9 years the enormous sum of £3,613 has been paid in interest.  In addition to that another three year’s interest has been paid.  A new lease on the old terms would compel the payment of £403-17-8 p.a.  There is no more economical way of operating them than that currently employed.  We hope the deputation will put the unchallengeable facts before the Commissioner and make the best possible arrangements.
