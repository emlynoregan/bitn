J.M. McBride.  There is a note concerning this popular local philanthropist.

He was born in Northern Ireland in 1831, the eldest son of James McBride.  He went to sea at 14 and settled in SA in 1856.  He became one of our most successful sheep owners.  He also made much money out of Broken Hill, buying shares at about £10 each and selling them later at about £1,400.  He has been married twice and has 5 sons and 6 daughters.  He is very popular in Burra where he has done a great deal pro bono publico.
