SA Statistics for 1850 are published for land sales, population and immigration and emigration.

Population figures 1844-50 are printed.  Those for 1851 were:

Males 35,963 	Females 27,737	Total 63,700	Aborigines in settled districts estimated at 3,730.

The migration figures are necessarily rather complicated, but one or two items are interesting.

Each year from 1847 shows a nett loss of population to Melbourne and this was especially marked in 1850 & 1851.

There were nett gains from Sydney.

The only significant arrivals from places other than the UK were from Germany:

1847 +716, 1848 + 907, 1849 + 1,607, 1850 + 1,079.

There were small emigration losses to the UK, but less than 1% of the gains from that source.

Apart from the nett losses to Melbourne the other interesting outflow was to California as a result of the gold rush there.  1847, 0; 1848, 0; 1849 -105; 1850, -650.

‘Registered voters in SA Electoral Districts in 1851’ is an interesting group of figures:
