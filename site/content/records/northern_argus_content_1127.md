The Hawker Family has bought back East Bungaree stud.  East Bungaree Pty Ltd has sold the property to Hawker Bungaree Proprietors.  The studâ€™s history goes back to 1841 and was held by the Hawker family until 1980, when following the death of G. Stanley Hawker it was sold to the late W.H. Wylie.  The new joint proprietors will be George and Andrew Hawker.  The two studs will remain separate entities.  Hawker Bungaree Proprietors now become one of the largest stud Merino breeders in the world, owning in excess of 30,000 stud merino sheep.  [Photo.]
