Black Springs School

On Thursday 26 November a Back-to-School was held.  The present schoolmaster Mr C.B. Kermode handed the old scholars over to Mrs O’Malley, formerly Miss Ellen Clancey, who had been appointed to the school in 1920.  She called the roll, inspected their attire and cleanliness and marched them off to salute the flag and then into school.  Mr Kermode called the roll from the 1879 register.

It is thought the school was first held in a pug and pine building also used as the church and situated  in a north-eastern direction from the present Anglican Church* and across the road in what is now R. Fatchen’s property.  The oldest scholar present was Horace J. Dunn† of Barton Hill who was admitted in February 1879.  Mrs Wiese‡ nee Miriam Gilbert came later in the day: she was enrolled in January 1879.  Mrs J. Whellum§ nee Rhoda Gilbert, who was also present, is thought to have attended in 1878, but records before 1879 are not to hand.

Photographs were taken and reminiscences indulged in.  Mr C.A. Heinrich presided at a banquet in the Black Springs Hall.  [Some of the reminiscences and a list of old scholars are printed in a report a little longer than 1½ columns.]
