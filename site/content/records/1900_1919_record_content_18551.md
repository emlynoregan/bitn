The main road grant was £273 and this has been expended.

The Cemetery has received much attention and has been improved.  The account is in credit £57-5-8.

The Local Board of Health has had no significant outbreaks of infectious disease to deal with this year with only a few cases of scarlatina reported.  The sanitary condition of the town has been maintained.  The account is in credit £79-0-8.

The Council has worked very harmoniously this year and thanks are extended to Councillors, the Town Clerk and other Council workers.

C.A. Fuss moved the adoption of the report.

Cr W.C.L. West said he had decided to retire as a Councillor after 14 years on the Corporation.

The retiring Mayor Mr J. Drew said the town could do with 10 or 12 more acetylene lamps.  He was disappointed with the destruction of young trees by lads.  Tar paving of paths was cheaper than gravelling and almost as good as asphalt.  He could not see his way clear to nominating for Mayor again.

Mr Davis tried to move a vote of thanks to Cr Roach, but when he turned it into an attack on Council for black-balling him over the scavenging tender he was ruled out of order.

R. Ockenden then moved a vote of thanks to the retiring Mayor and Councillors and was seconded by C.A. Fuss.

Mr Davis then got in his complaint about not getting the scavenging contract when it was awarded to the highest tender.  He thanked Cr Roach for trying to be fair, even though he was overruled.

Cr Roach said he didn’t appreciate Mr Davis’s remarks at all and in retrospect thought he deserved censure for revealing what had gone on in the Council Chamber and now endorsed the actions of his colleagues who had done the proper thing in accepting the highest tender.

Candidates were then invited to speak.

Cr West said his experience in Council over 14 years made him well qualified to become Mayor.  He favoured the planting of trees and tar dressing and was against any increase in rates.

J. Walker thought he was well known and if elected would do his best for town and ward.

R. Ockenden said it was only that day that he had decided to stand, but he would strive to do justice to all and side with no party.

Mr Hardy said he was in a bit of a fix.  He had asked Cr Snell if he was going to stand in East Ward, but he had said he didn’t know.  This left him [Mr Hardy] in a hole, as he didn’t want to ‘run amuck of the present councillor’.  He had promised North Ward ratepayers he would represent them, but now they had a candidate from their own ward and he would not oppose him.  He had been to Mr Wise and that gentleman had signed a nomination paper for West Ward, so he was now going for East Ward.  He heard Mr Ockenden was coming out for East Ward, but in reply had said ‘I don’t care if 500 Ockendens are coming out I am too.'

The Mayor and Councillors had worked well together.  There could be too much stagnation in Council.  ‘There were many shady things done while I was in Council.’

The rubbish depot was in the wrong place and it was common to see papers of all sorts blowing down the main street from the depot.

The Mayor said a man goes every day and burns the rubbish and if Mr Hardy were to go up there now he would not get enough paper to fill his hat.

The speaker then said he didn’t know what the depot was like lately, but it used to be bad.  (laughter)

Even if paper was not blown out of it microbes were blown all over the town from it.
