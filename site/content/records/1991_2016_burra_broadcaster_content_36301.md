Bryna Dunow, of Burra, a member of the Rate Review Committee, and a retired property valuer of the Valuer Generalâ€™s Office, voiced his opposition to the idea that unique service costs should be used as the basis for differential rating, saying it ignored the proposed rating model for the amalgamation of Councils, that rate parity should be achieved no later than 2006-07.

Council resolved:

Rates to be based on capital valuations.

That there would be a fixed charge.

That differential rates would be based on land use codes.

That differential rates would be based on twelve localities: Rural, Hallett, Whyte Yarcowie, Terowie, Burra, Farrell Flat, Booborowie, Mt Bryan, Robertstown, Point Pass, Eudunda and Hampden.

That unique service costs for townships be the basis for differential rating.

That the fixed charge would increase from the present 18% to 30% of the general revenue within 8 years.

That there be a maximum of 12% increase for each locality over a period of 5 years until all localities achieve the required rate in the dollar.

That the STEDS charge would be retained.

That there would be a waste collection charge.
