Big Burra Fire

Early last Friday [April 8]  morning fire was found to have taken a strong hold on the offices of W.J. Davey of the Burra Record and of the shop of Mr S.M. Lane, saddler and ironmonger.  The only water available was from household tanks and the Market Square pump.  A bucket line of men and women worked hard, some of them from the roof of adjacent buildings.  The fire seems to have started at the rear of the buildings, but it has not been ascertained at which of them.  All that could be done was to prevent the spread of the fire to the adjoining premises of T.W. Wilkinson, chemist and L.L. Wicklein, jeweller.  The front room of Lane’s shop was soon cleared of stock, which was thrown onto the roadway.  Mr Lane came in time to rescue his books and some valuable property, as did Mr Davey.

The four inch main of town water, which passes the properties could not be used.

Mr Lane’s losses have been covered by insurance, but Mr Davey will have losses of £500 in excess of the insurance cover.  Several of those present received minor injuries.  Mr J. Urwin tripped over his own skylight.  On young man called Herbert fainted and another called Williams received a nasty gash from a sheet of corrugated iron.  Some helpers behaved rashly and even foolishly – removing packages of ironmongery, but leaving flammable materials that fed the flames – or ‘saving’ boxes of lamp glasses by throwing them onto the metalled road.  The calm night was all that prevented the fire from spreading disastrously.  Mr Lane will be able to begin trading once he has sorted his stock, but the Burra Record will be closed for some time, pending the provision of type, machinery and stock.  Several items of Mr Lane’s rescued stock were stolen.
