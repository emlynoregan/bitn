Gully v. Lynch & Lynch v. Gully

This was a case of cross actions for assault between two women living in tents at Hallett. [Most likely in connection with the railway extension to Terowie.] The argument was over a pig. Susan Godfrey was a witness for Mrs Lynch and evidently supported the latter's evidence of disgusting language used by Gully and also that she had thrown clods of earth at

Lynch. Gully was fined 10/- + cost to a total of 44/-. The counter charge was dismissed for lack of evidence.
