Advertisement.  The Reformer will go to the Burra Burra on Monday and Thursday next, should inducement offer.  The Reformer stage-cart and the Reformer stage-coach.  Single fare up £1.

Both may be hired there and back.  The cart with two horses for £6 and the coach with four for £10, stopping two days at the mines if required.  If detained longer the charge will be 10/- per day for the cart and £1 per day for the coach.  This is a great reduction of former prices; the public have to thank the mail contractor for it; who threatened personally to ruin me or anyone else, by running the road for 5/- if we got the mail.  But does he know that I have carried scores for nothing and found them in grub on the road. I find more lasting pleasure in doing good than in making money; this was the monster that brought sin into the world, and in too many cases makes knaves or tyrants of its possessors.  I wish the mail contractor to know that I am prepared to run the road this winter at the lowest, not the highest prices he may fix; and further, that I consider myself, in no good point, his inferior, except in size.  W.W.G. Nicholls, Hindley-street West.  17 March 1848.
