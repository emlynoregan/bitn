Burra Town Council has dropped the rate this year from 3/8 to3/6 as the result of the new assessment.  The Mayor said the Council had reduced its £600 overdraft by £260 last year and hoped to continue to reduce it.  They had to allow for rising wages, but anticipated that a 3/6 rate would yield £150 above the estimated expenses.  Cr Fisher thought the rate should be 3/8 as it was better to strike a high rate while times were good.  His amendment lapsed for want of a seconder.
