Letter.  Barbara Wallis writes concerning the decision to strip Morphett’s Engine House of all its displays and exhibits so it can be put on the passport key system.  This is said to be because it has gone over budget for the last two years, but when it was run by a section 199 committee it stayed within budget and even made a profit – the change she described as vandalism.
