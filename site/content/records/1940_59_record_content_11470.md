Cr Marston reported on the discussions with the Institute Committee.  The Committee would recommend the sale if the purchase price was the amount of the bank overdraft on the day of taking over, with Council to pay the transfer costs.  There would be quite a lot of red tape to negotiate and Council would have little to do with the Library management, where subscribers would have the balance of power on the Library Committee.
