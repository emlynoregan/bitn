Kooringa, 4 January.

On Christmas Day the Primitive Methodists held anniversary tea and public meetings in aid of their Sunday school.  They were largely attended and the proceeds were satisfactory.

On Monday & Tuesday  [27 & 28 December] the weather prevented any outdoor amusements, but the Burra Amateur Christy Minstrels gave an entertainment at the Burra Hotel Assembly Rooms, assisted by the local brass band.  Attendances were good.  The performances closed with a burlesque on ventriloquism and the Japanese Band.  Tuesdayâ€™s entertainment aided the poor of the district.

On Monday [3 January] there was a holiday instead of on Saturday and the annual Wesleyan Sunday school picnic took place at Princess Royal.  The weather was ideal and a large gathering set out bent on enjoyment.  Over 1,000 persons including children visited the grounds during the day.  Eight wagons of the SA Carrying Co. took the children.  Some of the visitors played cricket, while others did a service to Mr McCulloch by killing rabbits.
