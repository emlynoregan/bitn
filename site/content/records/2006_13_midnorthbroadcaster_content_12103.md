Notice.  Regional Council of Goyder

A search of old records reveals that Jessie Street is a private road.  Council now proposes to declare the private road Jessie Street to be a public road under the provisions of Section 210 of the Local Government Act 1999.

It is subsequently intended to close a portion of Jessie Street and merge the land occupied by that road into adjoining titles.
