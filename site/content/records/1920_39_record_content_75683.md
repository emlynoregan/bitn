Mongolata Goldfield

After a long spell without significant finds two nice ingots were brought in last week representing battery returns: one from Byles’ Mongolata GM and one from the Curlew Claim.  The first was from the first crushing under the new Board of Directors led by I.J. Warnes when 4½ tons produced 11oz 10dwt with tailings to come.  Curlew’s ingot of 15oz 18dwt 16gr came from 7 tons.
