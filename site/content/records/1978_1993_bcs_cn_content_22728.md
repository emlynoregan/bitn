Burra Cemetery

In November 1990 the Burra Burra DC commissioned a conservation study of Burra cemeteries.  In 1987 it was proposed to erect a shelter to protect gravestones against the western wall.  State Heritage Branch refused this request and a conservation study was recommended.  The study has some positive and worthwhile recommendations, which will now be considered by the Burra Burra DC and the State Heritage Branch.
