Miss Bubb replied to Mr Halls’ recent allegations.  She denies letting him know at the last minute – he is not on the phone and the Reformatory is distant.  The Exchange Hotel is phoned in the morning and a message is left for him on his return from the morning train, or an officer intercepts him on a trip to or from the earlier train.
