Cr Kellaway asked when action was going to be taken to remove the guns – they were a children’s plaything.  He had taken exception to the anonymous letter in the Record from ‘A Returned Soldier’ accusing him of losing his loyalty.  If an accident occurred to a child and the guns did not belong to the Council, who was responsible?  He wanted them in front of the Town Hall.

[He did not say how this move would change the nature of the problems he had raised.]

The Mayor said that as far as he could determine the guns were Council property.  He also took issue with the anonymous writer whose letter ‘smacked of stabbing a man in the back’.  Only in cases where there were guard fences were guns put in public streets.  Only the other day he had seen them with their noses to the ground.  Impugning the Council’s respect for the soldiers was too contemptible to answer.

Mr Lane the Vice-President of the RSL agreed they should be moved.

Dr Steele, the President of the RSL was emphatically opposed and asked that the matter be deferred until the RSL met to consider it.

Cr Riggs was against moving the guns, but did not consider anonymous letters worthy of notice and would go with the majority.

Cr Woollacott said the removal would benefit both the guns and the monument.  The guns needed painting.

Cr Allen supported the moving of the guns.  The decision was deferred for two weeks.
