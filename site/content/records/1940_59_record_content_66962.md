Burra Post Office

Burra Progress Assoc. enquired some time ago asking if and when the Director of Posts and Telegraphs intended to erect a new Post Office in Burra.  The Department purchased a block of land near the Billiard Saloon some time ago and this would be an ideal site.  The Department has now said that the inadequacies of the existing building and the need for a new one are well known, but the higher priority of other building projects and lack of funds has precluded any start.  The project is on the 1955-56 program, but could possibly be delayed till the 1956-57 financial year.
