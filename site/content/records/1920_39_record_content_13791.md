Letter from Harold C. Atkins of Farrell’s Flat writes as an employer of a ‘Barwell Boy’, complaining that such boys are too often invited out for evenings, leaving the farming family to do the evening work.  People erroneously feel these lads have no homes, but the farmer is providing a home and can rightly expect them to be there to do the evening chores.
