In the last few months we have presented cheques to the value of Â£20 each to 14 of our heroes who have been wounded or disabled through sickness and have quietly assisted others.

In December we asked the Institute to take charge of our collection of photographs to be hung in that building.  We have presented the local RSL with the Cheer-up piano and also with a framed enlargement of the Cheer-up Ladies Band.  The cheer-up Room is now abandoned and we thank J. Pearce for the free use of it for nearly five years.

The Band has found it impossible to accept the invitations to perform in many places this year.  It did visit Adelaide on 20 June for Violet Day there.  At the last minute they filled in for the Military & Naval Bands, which were to perform at the Memorial service, but were unable to attend.  In the afternoon girls of the Ladies Band were invested with their service stripes by Brig.-Gen. C.B. Antill.  G.E. Dane from the Committee of the Society responded on behalf of the girls.  Hundreds of interstate soldiers were present to hear the Band, which the majority had read about.  The girls with hard-working bandmaster J. Bentley have Mrs Seager to thank for the numerous kindnesses received at the Hut on every occasion they have visited Adelaide.

On 28 August the Band played at the wonderful reception accorded the Prime Minister the Hon. W. Hughes at the Burra Railway Station and Mr Crewes presented the PM with a framed photo of the Band.  The PM expressed his appreciation of the Band; feelings echoed by Sir Joseph Cook.

The Band appeared at all the station welcomes and patriotic gatherings, not forgetting Peace Day celebrations on 19 July.  Their work as the Burra Cheer-up Ladies Band is practically finished.  As far as we can ascertain it was the only Ladies Band in Australasia until their example was copied in different towns.  Now the boys are home it will no longer be known as a patriotic band, though a Ladies Band may continue.  Mr Bentley is to be congratulated for his unflagging work with the band.

We thank James Reed for driving the large number of returning men to their homes.

Thanks also go to E.J. Harris for granting the free use of his crockery all these years.

Also special thanks are due to our President E.W. Crewes, Vice-President J. Drew, Treasurer F. Harris and to G.E. Dane who has kept the piano tuned free of charge and to my assistant Miss Ethel James.

Trix Pearce, Secretary.
