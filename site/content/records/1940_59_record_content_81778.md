Burra Bowling Club held its AGM on 6 June in the Club House.  Elected: Patron, E. Finch; President, G.H. Dollman; Vice-Presidents, S.J. Woollacott & D. Jacka; Secretary, J.B. Topsfield and Treasurer & Assistant Secretary, F. Sims. Retiring President Mr H. Binks-Williams reported a busy and successful year.  They had conducted their 1st Easter Tournament very successfully.  Major additions and alterations to the property are now in their closing stages.  This will require financial assistance from the bank and the main groundwork is under contract to Mr J.A. Giles, a professional expert from Adelaide at a cost of Â£800.  Membership has expanded to 58 plus 7 night members.  Associates have also increased in numbers to about 45.  Finances are sound.  Many thanks are due to Frank Fillmore as greenkeeper.

At a meeting on 9 June it was decided to form a second Bowling Association independent of the Mid-North Bowling Association (of which Burra and Spalding are members).  The new Association is to be the North-Eastern Bowling Association and it will comprise two teams from Hallett and one each from Spalding and Burra.  Each team for now is to comprise three rinks.  Election of officers: President, George terry and Secretary, H. Binks-Williams.
