Burra Rifle Club

Darrell Field went to the State Prize Meeting at Port Adelaide on Monday and scored the possible in ‘The Bonython’ fired over 800 yards.  Hancock from Tarilla also scored the possible and they had to shoot off for the title.    Hancock dropped one for an inner, but Darrell Field kept in the bull and won the prize.  A number of other Burra members attended the Prize Meeting and also did well.
