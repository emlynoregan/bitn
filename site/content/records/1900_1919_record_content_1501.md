Local Court, 21 August

Thomas Kitchen was charged with obstructing a footpath in Kooringa on 28 July by allowing a vegetable basket to remain on the footpath in front of his premises longer than necessary for removing and housing the same.  He had previously sent a letter pleading guilty, but the Bench demanded he attend and adjourned the case.  When he attended he pleaded not guilty.  The case depended on the Inspector being able to prove the basket he saw there at 3 p.m. was the same he saw there between 5 & 6 p.m.  He could not do so and the case was dismissed without costs.

Robert Kewley of Hamilton was summonsed to show cause why he should not contribute to the support of his mother Eliza Kewley of Kooringa.  Mrs Kewley 68 said she had received £7 in 12 years and it was three or four years since any payment.  He was unmarried and she was destitute.  A younger son, George, had kept her for the past 12 years, but he was now out of work in Broken Hill.  She wanted 5/- a week.  (Another son had not been heard of for 17 years.)  Robert Kewley said his work was not constant and he got 10/- to 12/- a week on farms.  The Bench ordered a payment of 3/- a week and the defendant seemed satisfied, paying six weeks’ allowance into the court.
