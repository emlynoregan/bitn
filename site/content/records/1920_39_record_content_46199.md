A Bolt.  The horse in Jeffery & Byrne’s butcher’s cart bolted from Mrs Thamm’s residence in Aberdeen.  It went down the Mine Road to Kooringa, through Market Square and took Lloyd St to Bridge St, but in trying to turn into Chapel St it crashed into a tree.  The horse fell and the cart turned upside down.  The horse was all right.  Mr Bob Lomman the driver was not in the vehicle when the horse bolted.
