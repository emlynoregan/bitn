Burra Cheer-up Soc.

The Ladies’ band was to have gone to Adelaide on the morning of the 12 November, but unanimously agreed that their first duty was to Burra and so stayed for the celebrations on Tuesday morning and left by the afternoon train.  On arrival in Adelaide they were taken to The Hut and given a rousing reception.  The Band then headed the Cheer-up Contingent to the Exhibition [Building?] where a multitude of mainly women had assembled to honour the French Mission, General Pau and the women of France.  They played selections till the Governor and Lady Galway arrived, when they played the National Anthem and accompanied the singing in the evening.  The Girls were invited to remain and take part in the Monster Peace Celebrations on Thursday, but they returned to Burra on the train carrying the French Mission.

On Thursday the Ladies’ band assisted at the demonstration in Market Square.

On Saturday they went to the Leighton Fete.

Today, Wednesday, they are taking part in the fete in aid of patriotic funds at Mrs A. Melrose’s ‘Kadlunga’ at Mintaro.

On Friday Cheer-ups are in charge of the sweet stall at the Returned Soldiers’ Fair in the Institute.
