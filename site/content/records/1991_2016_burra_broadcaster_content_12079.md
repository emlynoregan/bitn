Police are concerned about road safety in Market Square and Commercial Street, with heavy transports negotiating the area.  Heavy vehicles carrying dangerous goods should be banned from the town area.  To achieve this, the bypass road needs to be upgraded.  Officer Kaiser suggested also that the give-way sign at the T-junction on Market Square should be replaced with a stop sign.  (It is difficult to see traffic approaching from Kingston Street Bridge because of the Council Chamber).  Council does not have the funds to seal the bypass, but the Department of Transport has agreed to extend the median into the Market Square, Commercial Street intersection.
