BCS.  Staff Profile: Terry Swan

I am an English and Society & Environment teacher.  I began teaching at Victor Harbor HS in 1985 on short term contracts and moved to Jamestown HS in 1989, spending four years there – the last two as Co-ordinator and School Counsellor and I applied for a transfer to BCS at the beginning of the year.  My wife and I with our two daughters live in Clare – having been there now for 2½ years.  [Photo.]
