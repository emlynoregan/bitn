Big Welcome Home Rally at Burra Town Hall

Nine returned men were welcomed at a dance at the Town Hall on Friday.  The mayor began by reading letters and telegrams from men unable to be present: Frank Preiss, Cyril Beckwith, Don Halliday, Dick Smith, Robert Lee and Mark Lee.

He then introduced the men present:

LAC Tom Rogers

Pte Fred Lewis

Pte Johnson

Pte Dennis Harris

Signaller Harris

Pte Jack Harris

Sgt Carl Pearce

Lt Campbell

Sgt Reg. Lee

Following Mr Woollacott’s welcome, speeches were delivered by Dr D.M. Steele on behalf of the Burra Soldiers’ Welfare Committee, M.T. Full for the RSL, A.B. Riggs for the Fathers’ Association and H.J. B. Jennison on behalf of the Town Council.  Sgt Carl Pearce responded for the men and was seconded by LAC T. Rogers, supported by Pte J. Harris.

The Mayor drew the attention of the gathering to the poor response of Burra to the Fourth Victory Loan.

The formal part of the evening ended with the singing of The National Anthem, The Song of Australia and For They are Jolly Good Fellows.  Dancing followed until midnight to the music of the Black Diamond Orchestra.
