Only one grade of petrol would be available in future.  It was resolved to waive any claim for rent on idle kerbside pumps as a result of this, obviating the necessity of owners removing the idle pumps.

The Mayor reported on the delegation to the Commissioner of Works about the re-opening of the Aberdeen Ballast Quarry.  He said they had explained the disabilities the town was suffering due to the drought and the outflow of people.  They had presented a petition with 60 signatures.  He said they were received well and the Commissioner said he would take the matter up with the Highways Commissioner.

LAC Colin Morrison was accorded a social at World’s End on 3 May.  Prior to his enlisting he had been in charge of the World’s End School and had been most active in sporting and social activities in the district.  Speakers were Mr A.G. Heinrich, Mr Eric McWaters, Mr Jack McWaters, Mrs Eric McWaters, Mr W.H. McWaters, Mr Tiggeman (the present teacher), Mr Jack McLean and Mr Percy J. Thomas.  A presentation was made of a gold-tipped pen and pencil in a case and a sum of £1-17-0.  Mr Morrison has seven brothers and brothers-in-law present on active service.  His father had served in the Boer War and the Great War
