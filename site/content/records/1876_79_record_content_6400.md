`We have a right to the credit.' It deserved an opening worthy of a corporate town. (This, he said, was not angling for re-election as Mayor as he wouldn't accept the job at Â£1,000 p.a.

Letter from `Enquirer' also asks why there has been no opening ceremony for the bridge. The Editor says: -

The work is incomplete and the bridge not really safe for traffic until the wing walls on the approaches are finished.

The surveyor in charge opened the bridge to traffic without informing Council.
