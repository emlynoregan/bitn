Market Square & Best Place Redevelopment.  Council staff are getting a lot of constructive feedback â€“ mostly on Market Square.  The proposed changes should enhance the entrance to Burra and reduce the speed of vehicles through the area, create a landscaped area for interpretive signs and public art.  There is potential for considerable impact on retail and commercial operations and Council is anxious for feedback from this group.
