Adchem has shipped out its first load of basic cupric carbonate, better known as malachite.  This first load of 20 tonnes is going to Osmose in Memphis, Tennessee, USA.  Production could grow to around 5,000 tons of carbonate annually within twelve months, which would represent 20% of the plantâ€™s business, said operations manager Simon Kibble.
