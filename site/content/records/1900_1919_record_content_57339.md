Navy Day in Burra was held on Friday [sic]

[For weeks the advertising had been for Wednesday 30 October, so this is presumably an error, especially as we are told the decoration committee set to work on Tuesday evening.]

Bunting went up all over the square etc., and marquees and stalls were erected, but by dawn a gale was blowing and decorations were hastily taken down to save damage.  The demonstration was hastily transferred to the Institute.  It was decided to proceed with the procession, starting from the station with the arrival of the Naval Band.  The train was half an hour late.  With the band came Lieut. Argent of the Naval Depot, the Mayor of Pt Adelaide (C. Smith) & J.N. Laurence of Adelaide Seamen’s Mission.

The procession was led by mounted returned soldiers under Lieut. Phillis & Sgt D. Thompson, then the Cheer-up Ladies’ band, the Boy Scouts, The Naval Band (26 in number), Copperhouse schoolchildren in sailor costumes, decorated pram of Miss Nellie Gray, Tin-can Band, Burra State School Children, then numerous cars and buggies, but with little decoration due to the boisterous weather.

At the square the Naval Band and the Ladies’ band joined forces in selections.  Mr Crewes announced that the appeal and auction would be held at 2.30 in front of the Institute, which provided a little shelter.  At 2.30 the two bands played again in front of the Institute and Mr Crewes spoke.  Last year £700 had been raised and he hoped for a similar total this year.  Lieut. Argent also spoke, followed by Mt Smith (Mayor of Pt Adelaide) and Mr J.N. Laurence.

Then a wonderful model of HMAS Sydney, made by men at the Naval Depot, was put up for auction by Lin Gordon, late Lieutenant in AIF and £435 was realised.  Mr J.H. Gallagher became the owner for £106.

The report mentions four bands, but it is not clear which are intended; presumably the Ladies’ band, the Naval Band, the Men’s Band and the Fife & Drum Band, assuming the Tin-can Band was just a bit of procession fun.

The report then describes the usual stalls.  By the end of the day c. £634 had been raised.
