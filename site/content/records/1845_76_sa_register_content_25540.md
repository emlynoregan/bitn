Dear friend if i may call you so i am mutch obliged to you for your kindness to a poor guilty sinner but great will be your reward in heaven i hope i shall meet you their and i hope that god will keep me faithful to the End o may be abl to say that live is Christ but to Die will be gain Bless the Lord he will not turn away any that come unto him for he says come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i will giv you rest i feel I have that rest i hope to die singing Victory through the Blood of the lamb i remain Yours truly a sinner saved by grace ELISABETH LILLIAN WOOLCOCK.”
