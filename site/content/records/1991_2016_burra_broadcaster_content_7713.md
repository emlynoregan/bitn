Pigmy Blue-Tongue

Barry Read has found pigmy blue-tongue lizards on his 80-acre property southeast of Burra, neighbouring Princess Royal, while tree-planting last week.  The Reads, Barry & Jill, are developing their property as a native botanical park.  The pigmy blue-tongue (Tiliqua adelaidensis) was only rediscovered in 1992; prior to which the last sighting was at Marion in 1959.  Nine sub-populations are now known between Burra and Peterborough.  Despite their name they have a pink tongue, which distinguishes them from their larger brethren.  [Photo.]
