Pte M. Ward was given a presentation at Miss Warner’s Café on 20 July while home on leave.  A.B. Riggs made the main speech, saying that Mick and his late parents had long been good citizens of Burra.  Mick had stepped into his father’s job in the Burra Show Society when the former had been unable to continue.  His brother Laurie had served in the forces overseas and was now back somewhere in Australia.  Other speakers were Mr H. Jennison, T.J. Canny, Roy Jeffery and the Mayor.  Mr Jeffery had been Mick’s late employer.
