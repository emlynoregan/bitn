Editorial on the Town Council’s approach to employment.  It criticises the habit of considering jobs vacant each year and suggests that while the salaries may legitimately be considered, the employees out to remain unless they are unsatisfactory: in which case there is no need to wait till year’s end.

Also the cemetery arrangements seem to have thrown £10 of funding money away for no good reason while calling for tenders for the daymen’s jobs is penny pinching, looking like an attempt to save 6d a day at the expense of workingmen’s wages.

Council needs to escape from the erroneous notion that it cannot bind its successor, which may be the origin of the annual appointment of officers idea.  Of course the Corporation continues in perpetuity and there is strictly no such thing as a new Council - in any event a Council is always doing things that bind successors.

2nd leader suggests that as now the world is much smaller and ‘the other side of the globe is not now far off’ Australia need to look to its own defence and other interests.  England is less prepared to look after us, and this is a powerful reason for federation.

[This was sparked by the question of the German annexation of New Guinea.]
