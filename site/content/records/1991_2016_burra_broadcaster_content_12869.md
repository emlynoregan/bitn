The 13th Annual Burra Picnic Races were held at Thistlebeds.  The crowd was smaller, but horse entries were still good.  Goyder House and Burra Day Care did the catering very well.  The track was fast and dusty, though Peter Reilly tried to keep it down with a water cart.  The main event, the Kooringa Hotel Cup, was won by Show Landy.

The Tea Rose Duo will perform in Burra as part of the Burra Antique Fair & Cultural Weekend.  The concert will aid the Burra Art Gallery.  The duo play a wide range of music from Bach to Led Zeppelin, Scott Joplin to Schubert.  They have appeared at venues across Australia, at the Edinburgh Fringe and in Penang and have supported Dudley Moore and Stephen Grapelli.  They will perform in the Old Courthouse on 3 May at 8 p.m.

Tickets $15.  [Advt. & article.]
