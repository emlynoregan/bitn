Burra Red Cross.  An article outlines the 100 years of Burra Red Cross from its formation on 25 August 1914, with a membership of c. 50, through the efforts of the 1939-45 war, to the present day, with a small contingent of members that nevertheless was able to raise more than $9,000 in the past year.  The Hon. Dan van Holst Pellekaan MP will unveil the Burra Red Cross Centenary Rose Garden on 21 October.
