Burra Town Council, 23 June

The Municipal Association advises there is no general ruling on the erection of [Ezybuilt] homes.  Therefore Council approval was given for erecting two such homes in Burra.

The Fire Brigade Board advises the likely cost for 1958 will be £739 with cost to Council approximately 25%.

The Town Planner’s Office writes re the Housing Trust’s building of two further houses in Queen Street area.

Quotes were submitted for floor tiles in the Town Hall Foyer and one was accepted.

RAOB offered £30 for the old dress circle chairs.  Accepted.
