National Parks & Wildlife Dept. will establish an office in Burra with two officers and support staff.  The new office will oversee the eastern pastoral area, kangaroo management and the maintenance of the Mokota Grasslands Conservation Park, the Spring Gully Conservation Park west of Clare and other areas as far away as Balaklava and Kapunda.  There are plans for the staff of Goyder Animal & Plant Control Board to move into the same office.
