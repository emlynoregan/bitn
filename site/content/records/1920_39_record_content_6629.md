Burra Institute AGM.

In 1921 the alterations and additions by Messrs James King & Sons costing £1,199 were completed.  9ft was added to the floor of the hall accommodating an extra 81 plus an additional 97 tip-up chairs in the new dress circle.  Painting and re-decorating was done by D. Jones and the new seating was supplied by James Marshall & Co.  The hall was reopened on 15 March and the donation of the film takings that night of £29-10-8 by Theatregraph Pictures was appreciated.  So too was the donation from Mr Dane’s Christmas Concert on 15 December when Theatregraph Pictures joined him in raising £36-6-9 for the Institute.
