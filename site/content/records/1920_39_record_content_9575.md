Characteristics of the 1922 paper.

Page 1

This was large advertisements, most of which were local.

Page 2

There were a mixture of advertisements dominated by stock and property sales and current activities in the district.  There were Government notices.  These generally filled at least 5 columns and sometimes the whole page.

Page 3

A few advertisements (sometimes including an overflow from page 2), but this was the heaviest news page.  The paper continued to be a fairly good record of the town and surrounding district events, though the correspondents’ reports from surrounding districts were somewhat erratic.  On some issues or events reports are very detailed – for some sports and court cases for example, but this does not always seem to be much of an indication of their relative importance.

Page 4

This page is a rather unpredictable mixture of advertising, news and non-news type articles.

Supplements were a little more common than for some time, often single sided and of varying sizes.
