Obituary.  Richard Blight died at Glenelg on 20 March aged 68.  He was born at Gumeracha and moved to ‘Cartapoo’ Hallett when very young with his parents.  The family took land and was devoted to agriculture and sheep.  The sons took over from the parents and later secured a block at Yongala and a pastoral lease northeast of Hallett, named Bendigo Paddock.  Richard, William & Frank Blight traded as Blight Bros.  William died nine years ago and the two remaining brothers (all of them bachelors) retired to Burra and later to Glenelg.  The business was managed then by Albert Blight [another brother].  On the occasions of Kooringa Methodist Sunday School’s anniversary tea the deceased used to provide the menu.  He is survived by a brother Ernest at Port Pirie and also Ernest Blight at Peterborough [sic], Fred Blight at Terowie and the youngest brother Frank is at Glenelg.  Mrs R. Maxwell of Clarence Park is a sister and another sister Mrs McL. Inglis of Henley died a few months ago.

[Richard Blight born 17 June 1859 at Gumeracha.  The Port Pirie brother was Robert Elliott.]
