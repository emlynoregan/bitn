Kooringa Teetotalism

The first of a series of fortnightly meetings on this topic was held at the Welsh Chapel on 21 September.  Joseph Sleep addressed a very large attendance and spoke on the evils of intemperance and the advantages of abstinence, from more than 15 yearsâ€™ experience.  Mr Tonkin gave a humorous speech and Mr Joseph Davies, after a short address in English, gave a speech to his countrymen in Welsh, going over the points made by speakers through the evening.  Several names were added to those who have pledged abstinence.
