Aberdeen Tennis Club held its AGM on 23 August.  President Dennis O’Reilly welcomed members.  For the 1971-72 season the club fielded two ‘A’ teams, three ‘B’ teams and one junior team in the Burra Tennis Association.  All three grades played in the grand finals.

‘A’ Grade White won their grand final.

‘B’ Grade Purple won their grand final.

The junior team went down to Kooringa in their grand final.

The year was financially successful although there have been expenses in the resurfacing of No. 5 court and the top dressing of No. 2.  Another expense was the erection of the pillars and the plaque honouring 30 years’ service to the club of Mr & Mrs S. Scroop.
