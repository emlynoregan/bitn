Four Gums were planted at Mt Bryan on the former railway reserve on Sunday 11 June, Pentecost Sunday, following directives from the SA Council of Churches.

Mrs Joyce Lomman of the Uniting Church planted the first tree.  She remembered when the church was first built as the Mt Bryan Methodist Church and recalled people of the day.

Mrs Nora Heneker, who came to Mt Bryan in 1945, planted a tree in memory of the Church of England people who attended the lovely little building that used to serve the Anglican community.

Father Laurie Quinn, Burra Parish Priest, planted a tree for all the Catholics who have lived in the area and recalled the building of St Brendan’s by his grandfather, William Henry Quinn and how his father and uncles had carted building stone from a quarry near Willalo.

Three children who attend Mt Bryan School planted the final tree: Jessie, Kahlia and India.

The gums are all of the species Eucalyptus leucoxyller rosea. [Sic]
