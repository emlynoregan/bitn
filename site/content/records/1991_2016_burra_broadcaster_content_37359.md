Burra Town Hall

Committee members and workers recently repainted the supper room and changed the slide on the kitchen counter to a lateral slide rather than a vertical one – much safer.  There are plans to move the wooden partition that divides the foyer from the hall, so as to enlarge the foyer.  It is hoped to move the large old projectors down into what was the Internet Room [originally the Lodge Room] and to decorate the walls with posters of old movies.  Mary Warnes Room now has Council photos on the walls and Burra’s Jubilee 150 quilt.  The committee will hold a supper recital on 23 September as a fundraiser towards ongoing refurbishment.  The recital will feature Anna Legge, a final year B Mus. Student at the Elder Conservatorium and Graeme Burgan, pianist, vocalist and choral conductor.  He is Musical Director of the Shine Choir, which visited Burra earlier in the year for the candlelit concert at St Mary’s.
