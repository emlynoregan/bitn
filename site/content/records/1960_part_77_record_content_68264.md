Mr & Mrs Oborn visited last week.  Mr Oborn was headmaster at Burra School many years ago.

[This is quite wrong.  John Stuart Russell Oborn was headmaster at Burra 1921 until his death at Burra Hospital 7 September 1931.  His wife, Ada Kate Oborn nee Cowin died 18 August 1968.  The visitor seems likely to have been one of his sons and his wife.]
