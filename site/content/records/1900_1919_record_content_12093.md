Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting, Institute on Thursday last.

E.W. Crewes took the chair.

The Mayor’s Report.

The financial year has been changed which makes this one of only 11 months.  It began with a credit of £54-10-0 and now is in credit £92-1-10 (partly due to the shorter year).

The Ward accounts are then printed.

Income for the year from all sources was £520-18-2 and from rates was £312-6-10½.

Salaries: Town Clerk £49-3-4, Inspector £33-6-8, Mayor’s allowance £15.

Unusual expenditure this year was £40-12-3 on lighting, but this included capital cost of the ‘Best Lights’ which when well maintained will not exceed the cost of the antiquated kerosene lamps and give a much better light.

There is still room here for extension.

The main road grant was £273, of which £269-19-5 has been expended and the main roads are now in good order.

The cemetery has been improved and more can be done given that the present balance is £53-2-11.

Three small reserves adjacent have been granted to the Corporation by SAMA and while obtaining title to these steps have been made to bring it all under the RPA.

Health.

Apart from a small outbreak of scarlatina the town’s health has been good this year.  The question of a public slaughterhouse has been discussed, but was again passed over this year.

The Waterworks.

It is to be hoped that this will be its last appearance in a Mayor’s Report.  Early in the year Council realised the appalling state of the Waterworks and that continuation of existing arrangements necessitated very great expenditure to be borne by the ratepayers.  A deputation asked for such concessions from the Commissioner of Public Works as would enable the Council to carry on without imposing an undue burden.  The Commissioner refused such concessions in any way.  Council than considered handing over the works as soon as possible to the Government.  The Government’s terms for a handover were obtained and Council was unanimous in accepting the same.  A ratepayers’ meeting received this recommendation and adopted it without dissent.  After further clarification of some points of detail the transfer to the Government was effected.  The amount of work done since to the whole system should convince anyone that it was the correct move and that we are much more likely to obtain a good supply of better water than was probable under Council control.

Thanks were expressed to the whole of Council and to the town Clerk, Mr Bartholomaeus and sympathy expressed for the latter’s recent bereavement.

Dr Sangster asked if the meat slaughtered outside the Corporation was inspected previous to being sold.  The answer was ‘No’.

Mr Lott enquired about arrangements between the District Council and the Corporation.
