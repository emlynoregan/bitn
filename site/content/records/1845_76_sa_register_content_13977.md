‘Uninterested’ also writes to the editor on the same topic.  He makes five points in response to the previously published correspondence.

The post office at present is far from central.

Only one building is in its neighbourhood and that is in ruins.

The proposed location in Commercial Street is only 10 yards from the old post office site, which was then considered central and remains so.

With a population of 4,000 the post office must engross the whole attention of the postmaster, without interruption with other matters.

Redruth has its own post office.
