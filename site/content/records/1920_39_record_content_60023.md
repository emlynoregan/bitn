Obituary.  Thomas Henry Bailey died at the Burra Hospital 7 February after a short illness.  He was one of the districts oldest and most progressive farmers and graziers.  He was born at Mintaro 9 November 1857.  His father had migrated from Somerset in that year.  When he was about 10 his father sold the Mintaro holding and moved to the Gum Creek area.  The fine old residence then erected is now the home of his [i.e. Thomas Henry] son Mr Clem Bailey.  As well as producing grain Mr Bailey carted wool from Paratoo in the 1880s and delivered goods by horse team to Silverton for Samuel Drew & Co. of Burra and on the return run delivered ore to Terowie.  Mr Bailey later held land at Hawker, Paratoo and Yongala.  He was the first man in the district to use a drill and superphosphate.  He sowed 20 acres as an experiment on five different farms for a successful outcome.  Also, with his brother George, he won ploughing contests that year for both single and double ploughs. He maintained a lively interest in farming to the end.  He took a lively interest in district affairs and was for many years a member of the Hanson DC.  He visited Burra weekly and was in only a few days before his death.  He was a member and strong supporter of the Anglican Church.  On 24 July 1888 he married Mary, only daughter of the late Mr & Mrs Duncan Blair of Leighton, who survives with three daughters and two sons: Miss Ida, Miss Eva, Mrs McRae Wood of Clare, Walter Bailey and Clem Bailey.  There are seven grandsons.
