The line form Jamestown was opened in December 1880 and it has been to hold a weekend of celebration from Friday 9 June.  The line’s history in a nutshell (with six photographs):

C. 1875 the first European settlement in the area took place on Section 216 Hundred of Yongala.

1874 the Pt Pirie to Crystal Brook line was built.

December 1875 the Crystal Brook line was opened – initially being worked by gravity from Crystal Brook to Pt Pirie and by horses in the other direction.  The steam locomotives arrived a month later, with the first steam power used on 31 January 1876.

9 November 1876 the line reached Gladstone and the formal opening was on 7 December 1876.

19 January 1878 the line was extended to Caltowie.

26 May 1878 the line reached Jamestown and was opened for public use 15 July 1878.

December 1879 work began on extending the line to Petersburg.

14 December 1880 the line from Jamestown reached the site that would become Petersburg (later renamed Peterborough).  This official opening coincided with the official opening by Governor Jervois of the broad gauge line from Hallett to Terowie.

11 May 1881 the narrow gauge line from Terowie to Petersburg opened.

22 November 1881 the narrow gauge line from Petersburg to Orroroo was officially opened.

May 1882 the line was extended to Quorn, to coincide with the opening of the Pt Augusta to Farina railway.

The narrow gauge line to Cockburn reached there 2 January 1887 and on 14 June 1887 was opened to public traffic.

This line was originally operated by X and Y Class locomotives, with the T Class becoming the mainstay from 1903 to the 1960s, boosted by Australian Standard Garratts from the early 1950s and by the 400 Class Garratts from 1953.  830 Class diesel-electrics were introduced in 1963.

Petersburg then became the narrow gauge hub in the north, with its administrative headquarters, workshops and servicing centre for steam and later diesel-electric locomotives, running sheds, freight depot, station and refreshment rooms, roundhouse and (later) bogie exchange facility.  It also developed hostels and housing for hundreds of workers and their families.

Petersburg/Peterborough was a vital link for travellers and freight between Adelaide and Alice Springs and between Sydney and Perth and for Broken Hill-Pt Pirie ore traffic.  At one time it had up to 120 trains a day passing through.
