Llewellyn Herbert Piggott of Porter’s Lagoon had a party on 19 November to celebrate his 90th birthday.  He was born at Watervale in 1871 to Richard and Eliza Piggott.  His parents settled at Clarendon in 1853 and about 1869 moved to Watervale where Richard Piggott was employed on property associated with the names of Duncan and Hughes.  Some of his children attended Stanley Grammar School established by Mr Coles.  In 1875 the family moved by wagon to Morchard where virgin land was taken up.  Here Herbert began farming with his father and continued when he and his parents moved to Booleroo Centre about 1892.  His father died in 1895 and in 1904 Herbert married Annie, eldest daughter of Richard and Christina Dunstan of Booleroo Centre.  He and other farmers of the area carted their wheat through picturesque Telowie Gorge to Port Germein – some 29 miles.  In 1911 he and his family moved to Porter’s Lagoon where he has resided ever since.  His two brothers and three sisters all lived to be over 80, but are now deceased: Robert (Wistow), Sidney (Lameroo), Mrs Sanders (Booleroo Centre), Mrs Nancarrow (Glenelg) and Mrs Sargent (Crystal Brook).  Of his seven children, five survive: Bert (Porter’s Lagoon), Tom (Clare), Myra Mrs Ross Reed (St Georges), Elvy Mrs Glen Krummel (Eudunda) and Lily Mrs Henshaw (Ormond, Melbourne).  Mabel and Jean are deceased.  Some 70 people attended the celebrations and Mrs Piggott responded capably on behalf of her husband.  [He died 15 June 1964 Riverton, residence Farrell Flat and his wife died 28 April 1972 at Clare aged 92.]
