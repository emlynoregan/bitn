Burra Town Council, 21 December 1959

The Mayor reported that Burra High School members had painted Johnny Green bright colours with the permission of the landowner.

Council will pay £1 towards the water rates of the Aberdeen Croquet Club.  (The Council owns the land.)

Council is to procure an Australian Flag to fly on Australia Day.

The warning bell at the Bon Accord crossing is unsatisfactory.  The Railways are to be asked to fit a reliable warning device.

The Council confirmed the Mayor’s action in allowing the Town Clerk to build an additional room at the residence.
