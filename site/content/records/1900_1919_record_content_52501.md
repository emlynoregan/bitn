(The Chairman, Mr McBride, was detained in Adelaide.)

The Premier expressed the hope that the meeting would restore harmony between the doctors and the Board.  He desired to hear all sides and hoped that after all was aired differences might be reconciled.

Mr Winnall, Vice-Chairman:

He said he was to present the Boardâ€™s case.  They felt they were on trial to some extent and he suggested they hear Dr Ashton first so the Board could answer the charges brought against them.

The Premier then read the resolution passed at the public meeting.

Mr McLaren said he was obliged to leave at noon and asked that any questions to be addressed to him be put before then.

Mr Winnall then put the case for the Board.  He said the statements made by the deputation were not entirely accurate.
