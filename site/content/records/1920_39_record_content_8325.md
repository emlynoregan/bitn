Soldiers’ Aid Soc. 7th AGM was held in Jubilee Hall on Wednesday with Miss Bubb (President) in the chair.

The Society gave the annual dinner for Returned Men last August and has aided sick soldiers through the Red Cross depot, the Renmark Hospital, The Stricken European Appeal, the Burra & District Soldiers’ Memorial Committee and the Royal Institution for the Blind.  Meetings have been well attended – 14 to 20 at the fortnightly meetings.  Elected were President, Miss Bubb; Vice Presidents, Mrs C. Bartholomaeus, Mrs C. Fuss & Mrs R. Elliott; Secretary, Miss C. Bartholomaeus; Treasurer, Mrs A.J. Wallis.  (In three years over £200 has been raised for the Royal Institution for the Blind.)
