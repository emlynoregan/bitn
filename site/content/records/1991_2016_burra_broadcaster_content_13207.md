Burra Show Society.  Mrs Jean Jamieson has been Secretary-Treasurer for more than 20 years and has announced she will retire at the next AGM in 1998.  She took over the role in 1976 from Darrell Field and was in the position when the ring was enlarged in 1977.  President at the time, Mr Ron Shipard praised her for her effort over the years.  This year the show will feature a ute competition and another Miners Revolution dance in the evening.  Changes are planned for the state finals of the Miss Showgirl Competition after the 1998 finals – the competition will then have both male and female participants – both to move with the times and to obtain better sponsorship returns.  A Young Citizen Award will replace it.  The Burra Show will not end the Show Girl Competition locally, but some changes will be announced next week.
