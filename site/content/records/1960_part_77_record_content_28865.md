St Mary’s Church.  The ecumenical service on Sunday was attended by more than 150 people.  Burra Choral Society led the singing.  Rev. Baxter from Clare conducted the service.  A highlight was the rendition of Psalm 86 and a motet by the quartet of Miss R. Reed, Mrs D. Cockington and Messrs A. Edwards and Fr Sibly.  Fr Sibly played the organ and Rosemary Reed also sang He was Despised from Handel's Messiah.
