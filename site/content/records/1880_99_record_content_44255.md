‘Musicus’ writes that he is concerned that last year a Fife & Drum Band was formed at Mt Bryan.  Two concerts raised not less than £10.  From this a single kettle drum appears to have been bought.  The schoolmaster intends to promote another concert for the cause, but first ‘Musicus’ would like a full accounting of the previous sum raised.
