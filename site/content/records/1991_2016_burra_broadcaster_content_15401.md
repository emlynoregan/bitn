Parent support in 1997 was fantastic.

The Kindergarten received visits in 1997 from the police, fire brigade, hospital nurse and ambulance officers, each of whom talked about how they helped the community.

Visits were paid to the bakery and to Mt Bryan School (the latter in return to a visit to us).

The Kindergarten raised funds by catering for the Romeo Car Club.

A picnic by the creek was fun.

A visit from Bubby Brown, Aboriginal artist, was another memorable event.

Emma Miller is welcomed as a teacher.

Office bearers for 1998 are: President, Lisa Murphy; Vice-President, Cathryn Peppiatt; Secretary, Lee Cousins and Treasurer, Vanessa Hinge.
