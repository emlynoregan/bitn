Obituary.  It is our painful duty in this issue to record the death of Mr H.C.W. Fuss, which took place at his residence, Redruth, on Thursday morning last after a few weeks illness at the age of 79 years.  The deceased gentleman was a very old and respected resident of Burra, having arrived in S.A. in 1847 in the good ship Herman Von Beckeratt.  Hearing so much at that time of the famous Burra Burra Mine, Mr Fuss visited the town, and fortunately found employment as a miner, but he only filled the position for a short time, when he was promoted to one higher, having sole charge of the smelting works charge-yard, and he mixed the first and last charge for the furnace.  After the smelters ceased operations Mr Fuss followed the occupation of farmer at Springbank for a few years, and then retired to a private and comfortable life.

The deceased gentleman never took any active part in public matters, but has always been known as an intelligent and industrious gardener, and in years gone by he was very successful at flower shows, and his generosity in imparting valuable knowledge concerning the growth and cultivation of all kinds of plants won him the respect and admiration of everyone who had transactions with him.  On Sunday, October 22 1893, the golden wedding of Mr and Mrs Fuss was celebrated at Redruth.  They were married at Neustatt, Harzburg, Germany on October 22, 1843.  Six sons and two daughters is the result of the marriage, all of whom are married, and in addition to these 46 grandchildren and two great grandchildren have been born.  One brother of the deceased gentleman is still living in Germany.  Up to the time of his late illness Mr Fuss had enjoyed exceptionally good health.  Much sympathy is expressed for the bereaved family, especially for Mrs Fuss who has reached the age of 79 years, but still enjoys fairly good health.

The funeral took place on Saturday afternoon and was largely attended, the burial service being conducted by the Rev. A.G. King.  [Heinrich Christian Wilhelm Fuss, born 1 March 1816, died 25 April 1895.]
