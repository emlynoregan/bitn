Bowling & Croquet Clubs.  The 1929-30 season opened on Saturday 26 October.  The President said it was the 11th anniversary of the opening of the club in 1918.  The club had not progressed as much as the district warranted.  Some new members were however noted.  He wished that like the Aberdeen Croquet Club they could have opened free from debt.  The clubâ€™s pennant was lowered to half mast in respect to the late A.G. Kellock, one of their best members.  Mrs W.H. Sandland opened the croquet green by hitting the first ball of the season.
