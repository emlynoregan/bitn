Burra Cheer-up Society had a good time in the city last Thursday at the opening of the Cheer-up Hut and the mounted girls were much admired.  The Mayor, E.W. Crewes was almost rendered speechless by the tremendous ovation he received when called upon to make an address in recognition of the magnificent work done for our boys in this town and district.
