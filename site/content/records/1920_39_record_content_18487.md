The Roll of Honour Committee met on Wednesday.  Their aim is to include on the roll every ‘boy’ who enlisted in Burra & District.  G. Dow has recently been elected Honorary Secretary.  After not meeting for some years, it has been roused by the input of c. £150 from the Back to Burra Committee’s surplus funds.  Already in hand is a considerable amount – perhaps c. £100, which puts it all on a practical footing.  Initially the idea was to place it in the public reading room, but now the main hall of the Institute is favoured.  Virtually the only business done on Wednesday was to instruct the secretary to obtain prices.  The proposed list will be published soon, so all will have a chance to correct errors and omissions.
