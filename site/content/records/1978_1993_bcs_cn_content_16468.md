BCS.  Staff Profile: Keith Knight

I began teaching French in 1972 at Balmoral in Western Victoria.  At first mortified to be sent away from Melbourne, friends, family and sports, it turned out to be the first in a series of rewarding postings in rural and regional communities: Neerim in West Gippsland, Tanlouse in Southern France and Independence in Iowa.  There were also two years at Parkdale H.S. (Melbourne) and four years at Christies Beach H.S. in SA.  I an enjoying teaching French here, especially at Primary level – a new experience and I am settling in with my wife Carol and son David (3½).
