Burra Town Council, 21 September

M.W. Bednall advised that the Recreation Ground had been transferred under the RPA from the Registrar of Companies to the corporation of Burra.

Mayor W. Carpenter and Crs Fisher & Baulderstone have been appointed to the Burra High School Council for three years from 1 July.

Burra Electric Supply Co. says all street lights have been inspected and repaired, except those over the bridge near Mr Bernhardtâ€™s, which was awaiting parts.

ETSA is to be approached to see if connection of Burra to their network can be advanced.
