Morphett’s, the new Main Shaft, was sunk to a depth of 600 ft at a point 1,000 ft south of the old workings.

Reports and Statements

Regrettably no records seem to have been kept of face assays of lode exposures in lower levels of Morphett’s Shaft and no records are extant from the bore-hole data to give angle of dip, direction, assays or description of cores.

Captain Sanders’ last report to directors in 1877 was confident of success if the mine were developed at depth.

Captain Hancock in October 1877 reported that with no attempt to prove the mine at depth, the evidence was that the prospects thoroughly warranted development of the property.

Samuel Higgs, manager of the Wallaroo Mines, also considered that the signs favoured exploration and development of the mine at depth.

The Chairman’s report for the period ended 30 September 1877 considered that will copper at an unprecedented low of £68 per ton it was inadvisable to continue operations.

In December 1898 the Government Geologist Mr H.Y.L. Brown reported that he had inspected the cores from the diamond drill and found it entered brecciated lode formation at 780 ft, which at 813 ft contained copper pyrites associated with quartz and calispar continuing several feet in depth.  The bore was now at 1004 ft in a brecciated lode formation.  The bore proved that the copper bearing lode mentioned in the last reports of previous mine managers as existing at a depth of 600 ft in Morphett’s Shaft and also in Waterhouse’s and Peacock’s Shafts is continuous in strike and that it exists at a depth of 800 ft, which is 200 ft deeper than in Morphett’s Shaft, the deepest sinking in the old mine.  This proves the continuance downwards of the copper-bearing ground and I believe enough data has been obtained to warrant the placing of Morphett’s Shaft in working order and for the starting of mining operations from that point.  I recommend a second bore on the eastern side as near the open cut as possible to try for the continuation of the rich ore-bearing body worked there, or the lode with which the carbonates deposited were connected, as such lode or lodes must exist.

In the 55th annual report to shareholders in April 1900 it was stated that boring had been discontinued after sulphides were detected at 706 ft and continued to 787 ft.  The directors were satisfied that this had proved the existence of copper-bearing country considerably below the deepest point in the old workings.

Captain Hancock’s last report dated 15 October 1900 said works had not been carried to a sufficient extent to prove the existence of payable deposits.  No exploratory work had been carried out underneath the open cut.  In sinking Morphett’s Shaft, 1,000 ft to the south, sulphide ore of good quality was found in small quantities and the extent of the ground increased at depth.  From the various indications Captain Hancock was of the opinion that with sufficient capital and efficient and economic management the mine was a promising speculation and deserving the attention of capitalists.

Mr W. West, the last manager in a report to the press dated 25 September 1901 said that Morphett’s Shaft, named after Sir John Morphett, was put down as a pumping station.  They found ore at 70 fathoms [420 ft].  At 510 ft they came on two lodes, Sanders’ and Kingston’s, containing rich sulphide ores from 27 to 40%.  At 600 ft the bottom of the shaft was studded with rich purple sulphide ore.

The program of operations:

With the copper price stable in wartime this is a good time to invest in the mine.  The mine should be equipped and placed on a sound producing basis with the plant run in and teething problems overcome, ready to reduce costs and increase efficiencies when the pegged price is abandoned and price fluctuations set in.  This stage should be reached quickly.

Steps required:

On a subscribed capital of £45,000, recondition Morphett’s Shaft, dewater the workings, erect headframe and winder, and proceed with developments at 510 ft and 600 ft levels.  Carry out tests on ore and if they are satisfactory design mill and place order for same.

Call up further capital to purchase mill and other equipment (£80,000).  Proceed with stope development and complete shaft equipment.  Erect second air compressor and mill.  Commence operations, aiming for 200 tons per day within 12 months.  Ship concentrates to Pt Kembla and carry out tests for smelting.  Design smelter and place orders for necessary equipment.

Call up further capital to provide c. £25,000 for smelters and acid treatment plant. Apply portion of accrued profits for erection of 200 tons per day leaching plant (c. £10,000).  Erect smelter and converter plant and commence smelting.  Design and order acid plant, then erect and begin operations.

[The article then argues the need for the smelting and leaching operations.]

Estimated capital requirements total £150,000 and given the national importance of the project, it is not expected the Commonwealth would object to raising this sum.

With a copper price of £70 per ton for blister copper and a 90% recovery rate of the copper, then the minimum grade of profitable ore would be 3.2% and reports from previous managers suggest it is possible to maintain production at a grade considerably in excess of this figure.

[A table then indicates that at an ore grade of 3.2% the annual profit could be expected to be £13,200, rising to £161,300 if the ore was at 8%.

There could be further profit from the leaching of the dumps and of the remnants of oxidised ores from the open cut, from the sale of pyritic concentrates, from selling excess sulphuric acid and from the sale of precious metals, which are present in minute quantities.

The article then explains that it would be intended to float a company with a board chosen from the most respected leading citizens of the state and it would be intended to try to raise as much as possible of the capital from citizens of Burra and the district, before opening the opportunities to the general public.
