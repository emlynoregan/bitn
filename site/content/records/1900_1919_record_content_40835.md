Letter from ‘Fairplay’ responding to ‘L.A.M.’ variously countering his points and maintaining with some force that ‘if a man owes the money he gambles away it is [a crime].  There is no comparison between the man who can afford to and the man who cannot be he upper or lower class as L.A.M. calls them’.
