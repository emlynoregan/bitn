Fire.  Three cottages in the unrestored row of Paxton Square were gutted by fire on Sunday causing an estimated $50,000 damage.  Police who investigated believe the fire was deliberately started by using a cigarette lighter or matches to ignite a mattress.  Smoke was seen coming from under the cottage roofs at 3.30 p.m. on Sunday.  It took hold in the wooden shingles covered in corrugated iron.  The walls of the cottages were intact after the fire, which took two hours to extinguish.  The decently restored Kingston street row will be officially opened on 5 October as part of the Burra Heritage Town Jubilee 150 Project.  [Two photos of the fire in Paxton Terrace.]
