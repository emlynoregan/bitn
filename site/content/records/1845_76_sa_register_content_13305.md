Obituary/Inquest

On Saturday 14 April the town was thrown into alarm by the news that the Mine was on fire and some of the miners were burnt and suffocated.  Soon many people flocked to the scene of the disaster.  The scene bore a very serious aspect, though some of the reports had been rather exaggerated.  A great number had gathered around one of the shafts where two men named Thomas Pryor and Peter Johns had been brought to the surface, dead.  Nearby two dense columns of smoke ascended from Stocks’ and Graham’s Shafts.  Several other men had very narrow escapes.  Mark Mitchell was quite delirious when rescued and Captain Goldsworthy, who went down with some men to try to extinguish the fire, nearly suffered the same fate.  Men were then sent in search of others who might be in danger, but so far no more have been found.

At about noon the same day an inquest was held at the Mine Hospital on the bodies of the two deceased miners before Mr Macdonald SM with Captain Killicoat as foreman of the jury.

William Dunstan identified the men.

About 9 a.m. was at work in the mine when it became known some men were missing.  Went in search of them in the 20 fathom and found two, Mark Mitchell and John Tresona, who were much exhausted and unable to speak.  Went to another level to seek the other pair, but did not find them.  Returned to the plat and found them there dead.  They had been found by others while I was away.  Knew nothing of the origin of the fire.

John Allen:

I and several others were sent to search for any men that might be underground.  At the 20 fathoms I went aside from Graham’s Shaft and found Mitchell & Tresona.  Mitchell was alive and I brought him to the plat.  Returned for Tresona who was lying down unable to speak.  Then met a man called Bucket and we went in search of others.  We found Pryor with whom I remained on the plat.  Don’t know who found Johns.  There was much smoke in the place and I consider that the cause of their death.  There was smoke coming up the shaft in quantity.  I believe the deceased went down to try to extinguish the fire, not to their regular work.  Do not know the origin of the fire.  Smoking was common in the Mine, but that would not set fire to it.  The fire was in Stocks’ Shaft and the men were in Graham’s about 40 fathoms distant.  Did not see smoke below the 20 fathom level. When I took Pryor up he only gasped once.  Johns was dead when I saw him.

William Mitchell

At about 6.30 a.m.  came from underground when my attention was attracted by smoke coming out of a whip-shaft and a whim-shaft.  Went to see what it was.  It seemed to be burning timber below.  I had again to go down Graham’s Shaft to the 30.  When I and others were sitting on the plat I said if smoke came down to the 30 we would work in the 50 to escape it.  Just as we were about to start work the order was given to leave off work.  Took the ladder to the 20, but the smoke was too thick and so I went around another way.  I was then sent to search for the men supposed to be down there.  When I reached below some men were bringing Mitchell to the plat.  John Jenkins then came for help to recover Peter Johns.  The fire began in the pitch belonging to Richard Glanvill, John Tenby and William Snell.  Saw them on the surface at 7 o’clock.

Thomas Hosking

Saw smoke ascending from a ship and whim shaft.  Went to change my clothes and while doing so Thomas Mitchell came for me to go down with him.  Went to Stocks’ 25 and saw a body of fire.  Commenced to build a dam to cut off the grass from the fire, but we were soon driven from the place by smoke and had to run for our lives.  Several went with me then to the 30 and thence to the 20, Graham’s.  There we heard the cries of Captain Goldsworthy and a man named Hodge.  Caught Captain Goldsworthy’s hand and brought him out to the ladder road and returned for Hodge.  Went looking for more but was forded to the surface by smoke.  Five of us were ordered down again to search for men.  About two or three fathoms beyond Graham’s I saw Mark Mitchell and John Tresona.  Mitchell was sitting on the plat.  Took him back to the first man I saw and returned for Tresona who was lying on his face.  I carried him to the shaft and went in search of any others.  Searched all the levels in the 20 and found none, before going to Graham’s Shaft where the two deceased had been brought to the plat.  We bound them up as well as we could and sent them up in the gig.  I am a timberman and have no idea how the fire started.  Was not in that part of the mine yesterday and never saw fires below in the Mine.  The fire began in Glanvill’s pitch.  There was a body of fire.  I was near it.  I never knew a mine so well ventilated as the Burra Mine.  Believe the deceased were suffocated by the smoke.

Dr Maurau:

Was called to the mine about 9 o’clock.  Saw John Tresona who was sitting in the Captain’s office.  He was recovering from the effects of partial suffocation.  Ordered him home in a cart.  (Produced a certificate from Dr Mayne that Tresona was unable to attend.)  Saw Captain Goldsworthy who was recovering.  Saw Mark Mitchell who had just been brought up and was recovering.  Went to Graham’s Shaft and saw the bodies of Pryor and Johns who must have been dead for some time.  The cause of death in each instance was suffocation by smoke.

Richard Glanvill:

Worked the 25 fathom level in Stocks’ Shaft and left at 7 o’clock yesterday evening.  William Blackney was with me below.  Was employed wheeling stuff for Blackney, to fill in the bucket.  I took care to clear away anything that might cause fire and left no candle burning.  There was no one in the pitch when we left.  The fire will be a loss to us by damaging the pitch and preventing our working.  The pitch was not a good one; we were making wages and that was all.  There were some men working below our pitch.  The fire occurred nine fathoms from the shaft.  Neither of us used tobacco.  I do not know where the deceased were working or where they were found.

William Blackney  [Gave corroborative evidence] and then: I am certain we brought up our candles.  The other candles used were extinguished.  I did not keep any matches below.  The candle we used in working was stuck up against the timber, but there was no fire when we left.

James Pryor:

I was with my brother, the deceased, at the time of the accident this morning.  I left my brother and five men in the level while I went to help stop the smoke.  [After about five minutes they were forced to crawl out on hands and knees.]

The coroner then ruled that although the cause of death had been determined for the two deceased, it was highly desirable that the cause of the fire be established and so he adjourned the inquiry until noon on Tuesday 17 April.

[Thomas Prior died 21 April 1860 at Burra Mine residence Redruth aged 24.

Peter Johns died 21 April 1860 at Burra Mine residence Kooringa aged 37.]
