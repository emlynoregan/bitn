SA Hospitals & Community Health Services will be managed by five Local Health Networks (LHNs) from 1 July 2011.  There will be three metropolitan networks and two state-wide.  The latter will manage country services and the other children’s, youth’s and women’s services.  The Minister of health John Hill said people would see little difference when seeking services, but it would reduce the bureaucracy and save about $1.5 million.
