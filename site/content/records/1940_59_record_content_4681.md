The Newton Bennett

Mr Reg Warnes of Woolgangi station motored into Burra Yesterday in a remarkable old battered warrior: a thirty-year-old Newton Bennett, originally owned by Dr Jack Sangster of Burra.  It speaks well for the machine that even though well loaded, it negotiated safely the flooded nature of the country.
