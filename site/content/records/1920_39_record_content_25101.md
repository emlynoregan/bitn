The writer wonders why the meeting is held after nomination day, as it would seem more logical if dissatisfactions arising from the report for the year were able to be expressed by nominating for election, but by the time of this meeting all positions were filled and the Council elected.

F.T. Sara was voted into the chair.

With respect to the cost of entertaining distinguished guests the Mayor said he had paid everything but the cost of the eatables – and his share was more than the ratepayers’. 

In 1917 the assessment had been £9,455 while now it was £17,129.

Mr Radford thought the town was well cared for and looked good generally, but the town gardens had slipped and the one in North Ward was a disgrace.  He favoured tree planting, but thought 100 well-tended trees would be a better investment that 600 allowed to die.

Mr Treloar was glad to see the town living within its means.

Mr Bednall thought the health rate could be reduced, as this year c. £500 had come in and £650 was expended, but a large part of that was on public lavatories.  He thought the way in which money was allotted to the wards needed changing.  North Ward needed more to maintain considerable lengths of what were practically main roads.  The other wards were more compact requiring less upkeep and were more densely populated.

Cr Woollacott in referring to changes since 1917 mentioned by Mr Radford said day wages were now 14/6 compared with 10/- in 1917.

Cr Riggs supported changing the allocation to wards.  He favoured no wards and working the town as a whole according to need.  He also wanted to motorise the Council’s transport and do away with horses and drays.

There was a special vote of thanks to the Mayoress.

The Mayor was proud to be continuing for a sixth consecutive term, but he was appalled that the whole Council had been elected unopposed.  He objected to Cr Riggs suggesting he was the only Councillor interested in lowering rates and also to Cr Riggs comments on the trees, which this year had died from severe frost and not lack of water or neglect: ‘he did not think Cr Riggs was a paragon of all the virtues’.  He said the employees had been too busy and some of the gardens were in a dismal state.  He rather favoured the changing of the town names to North and South Burra.  At present as far as the post office was concerned Burra was not on the map, but then neither were Kooringa and Aberdeen as far as the railway was concerned.

Mr Treloar wanted a firmer hand taken to destroy horehound.

Cr Fred Collins (newly elected) said he was well aware of the need for economy given widespread drought and financial prospects that were none too bright.

Cr J.E. Pearce, newly elected for East Ward, said one of the problems needing addressing was the poor water supply.  His ward was served by a 1½ inch main and he could get no supply after 5 o’clock and some places could get none all day.  He also favoured changing the town name to North and South Burra.

Cr Woollacott also objected to Cr Riggs claiming to be the only Councillor trying to reduce the rate.  The gardens in Kapunda looked like those in Burra should be.  He favoured tarring the road to Bewley’s Corner in Kooringa.  [The ‘Cactus Farm’.]  And the railway road and that to Abberton Park in Aberdeen.  These were the busiest roads, but were not main roads.  He wanted the Council to get more of the £4 the State Government collected on each of the 400 cars in the district – at least half of that sum.  He favoured a motor lorry for scavenging, which could also cart screenings and wanted the footpath between Kooringa & Aberdeen to be asphalted because people endangered their lives at night by walking on the road.

Mr Neagle objected to stray stock in the town.  ‘Many a night his slumbers had been disturbed.’

The Mayor said he often had trouble with cattle breaking his fences to get at his lucerne, but the Council could get neither a pound nor a pound-keeper.

The question of removing the guns in Market Square had kept the question of tar-paving the square in abeyance.
