Burra North Recreation Rooms were opened on Saturday night in unfavourable weather.  Burra Burra DC Mr R.J. Jeffery declared the rooms open.  President of the Aberdeen Football Club Mr Bruce Stockman hoped the rooms would be used for organised recreation.  The committee still has to raise about $1,200, having spent $2,500.  The AFC had donated $1,475 ($1,327 from the Women’s Auxiliary), the National Fitness Council $500 and the Basketball Club $300 to get the project started.  Mr Jeffery said there was some doubt about when the Aberdeen Football Club had been formed and 1911 had been suggested.  Mr Jeffery thought a much earlier date was needed, possibly 1896, as his father walked in from Copperhouse to play for it about that time.  Mr Stan Noske as President of the Mid North Football League added his congratulations to those of Mr Jeffery.  He appealed for people to enjoy the new facilities, but not to abuse them.  Mr Reed had been going to present Ivan Hirschausen with Life Membership of the Club, but was prevented by illness.  Mr Stockman made the presentation.  For her work, tolerance and time Mrs S. Scroop was also honoured with Life Membership.

[The paper’s reporting of football is rather erratic, which makes any history of the clubs in the town impossible to construct from this source.  There is a report of the formation of an Aberdeen Football Club in May 1881, but then no reports of matches until 1892.

From 1892 to 1897 there was an Aberdeen Club and a Burra Club.

In 1898 there is no mention of football in the town.

In 1899 there is one club: Burra.

In 1900 there seems to have been an Aberdeen Club and a Kooringa Club – although the former is once reported as Redruth and the latter occasionally called Burra.

In 1901 the Burra Club is mentioned, but not the Aberdeen.

In 1902 & 1903 there were three town clubs: Aberdeen, Kooringa (Burra) & Ramblers.

In 1904 there appears to have been no local competition and one game with Burra v. Clare.

From 1905 to 1912 there were three town clubs: Aberdeen, Kooringa & Ramblers.

In 1913 Ramblers merged with Kooringa to form Kooringa and Aberdeen continued, and a Light Horse Club was formed.

These three continued for 1914, though the Light Horse had to forfeit its matches after the 1st Semi-Final due to the outbreak of WWI.

In 1915 Kooringa & Light Horse merged to form Kooringa and Aberdeen continued.

1916-1918 Kooringa & Aberdeen were in recess due to WWI, though an occasional game was played for patriotic causes.

1919-1924 the two town teams were Kooringa & Aberdeen.

1925 & 1926 saw three town teams: Kooringa, Aberdeen & Ramblers.

1927-1929 there were two town teams: Aberdeen & Ramblers.

From 1930 to 1933 the two town teams were Aberdeen & Kooringa.

After that there was one town team called Kooringa and later Burra until Aberdeen was re-established in 1961.  The variations in the Associations within which these teams played are even more complicated]
