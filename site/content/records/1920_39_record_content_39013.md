Mongolata Goldfield

The Mayor announced at the last Council meeting on Monday that the Minister of Mines, the Federal Minister in Charge of Development Senator Daly, Local MPs and the Inspector of Mines intend to visit Mongolata shortly.  The Mayor hopes for £5,000 to develop the field.

Cr Jennison thought the Council should do all it could to work up general interest in the field.

The Mayor said many of the prospectors were very hard up and appeals for clothes, boots etc. came almost every Saturday.

Council declared its full support for the Mayor’s efforts to get funds to develop the field.

The Chief Inspector of Mines (Mr Winton) has issued a report giving a comprehensive description of the field some 14 miles by road northeast of Burra.  There are about 50 men on the field and about 5½ miles of country is being prospected.  A number of gold-bearing veins have been discovered and are being worked, but so far the distribution of gold in the formation has been patchy and intervening portions of low grade or barren.  A considerable part of the gold is not amenable to amalgamation.  The value of the battery tailings is high in all cases, ranging to as much as 19dwt 21gr per ton and cyaniding is indispensable on this account.  Prospecting has been confined to the eastern side of the hills, but gold-bearing veins have been found in the slate beds on the west side of the sandstone and the extent of these beds might well be examined.  So far 37 tons 12cwt of ore have yielded 138oz 3dwt 15gr valued at £530-17-2.
