Travelling Stock Roads.  A meeting was held at Hanson last Saturday on the cutting up of the TSR’s.

S. Green was for the action - they cost ratepayers money to destroy vermin and weeds - they were better let on terms for agriculture.  The roads in the Hanson District had never been used for their intended purpose.  They were used for cheap feed for stock awaiting a sale, but not legitimately travelling.  Three chain roads would be quite adequate for small squatters if used for their proper purpose of getting stock to market.

J. Cooksley moved the meeting support the cutting up and leasing of the TSR and reserves and endorses the Government’s stand against the deputation of squatters and salesmen.  He did not favour the sale, but did favour cutting them up for the relocating of settlers who had failed in the outside country.  The people who had the use of the TSR’s had had their day.  The deputation to the Commission was guided by selfish motives and they were backed by the salesmen in Burra.  It was in their interests to stand in the way of the majority.  They could not expect to have their way at the expense of the toiling farmer.  Mr S. Green 2nd.

The meeting then became somewhat warm with exchanges between farmers and sheep owners on the adequateness of three chain roads for purposes of travelling sheep.  Mr Green said the Government did not intend to cut up all TSR’s: only those near railway lines.

Mr H. Scott moved an amendment that it was very undesirable to cut up the TSR’s and said they contained very little good farming land and three chain roads would contain inadequate feed for travelling sheep, which could not economically be sent by rail.  He caused uproar by stating that the country would never be farming country and ‘farmers ought never to come this side of Gawler’.  Mr Bailey 2nd the amendment.

Mr A. Worby supported the amendment and Mr Humpries the motion.  Eli Goodridge and P. Dowd spoke for the amendment and Mr Cooksley said cutting up the TRS would offer a way out for the Baldina farmers and those from other places up country who could not survive where they were.  The original motion was carried.
