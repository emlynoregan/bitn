Goyder Council will receive a grant of $46,500 to enable the Burra Market Square-Best Place design development project to proceed.  Council will also contribute $46,500.

[There is a breakdown of how this money is to be spent – the article reads like a press release in pompous technical language: ‘In Best Place, visual vehicular access will be improved by altering sight lines and speed limits.’]
