Another Great Flood at Kooringa

The Mines have again escaped undamaged from a serious flood that has been disastrous for the town.  At 6 p.m. on Sunday 8 June the town was visited by a dreadful storm of hail, thunder and rain.  A correspondent to a merchant in Adelaide writes that his rooms at 8 p.m. were completely deluged and the main street was again ‘like another Niagara’ and there was another washout in the creek, though at present all was chaos.  The writer was at a loss to think how the post would get out as the roads were four feet deep in water with the water rushing through every outlet like a waterfall.  As he wrote the water was finding its way into every part of the house.

An account written at 11 p.m. arrived yesterday:

We have had another great flood preceded by a tremendous fall of rain.  Commercial Street is like a river.  Several more families have been washed out of the creek.  The creek rose this evening, after dark, so it is impossible to tell the extent of the damage, but it is expected to be very large.

The paper’s own correspondent wrote:

Midnight, Sunday, The Township of Kooringa has again been visited by a fearful flood.  In the afternoon thunder and lightning were terrific and the very heavy rain, which subsequently fell in torrents, caused a formidable flow of water from the surrounding hills.  By 7 p.m. all the houses on the lower ground in the town were a foot deep in water.  There was great apprehension that lives would be lost in the creek.  Thunder, lightning and heavy rain continued till 11 p.m., when the storm subsided.  The powerful stream that ran through the town to the Burra Creek continued to flow and many will spend a sleepless night, driven from their homes.  The damage has not as yet been ascertained, but is believed to be great.

An account written at 6 a.m. Monday morning said it was still raining and the street full of water, like a river.
