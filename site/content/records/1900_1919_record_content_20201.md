Golden Wedding of Mr & Mrs Bruse.

Mr Bruse came to SA from Rostach (Germany) in 1846 and soon went to the diggings.  In 1849 he came to Burra for the first time, but in a short time went to Bendigo, returning to Adelaide in 1852, where he worked as a cabinetmaker.  He went to the diggings for a third time (and each was fairly successful).  He married M. Daw in 1857, who came from Penzance in Cornwall.  He has now been a resident of Burra for 53 years.  Mrs Bruse is 71 and he is almost 81.  They have five sons and four daughters.
