Burra Sporting & Athletic Club – Local Wounded Soldiers’ Fund.

At the meeting on Friday in John Allen’s office the President, J. Gallagher, reminded them that the fund was intended to offer immediate help to local returned wounded men.  The intention was to make a donation without asking what the recipient was going to do with it.  The Burra boys were by no means all in the same position.  Some parents were living on their son’s military pay, while others were banking it for their son.

The executives would try to allot gifts according to the club’s funds and the individual’s needs, but all would get some sort of gift regardless of their financial position.  Mr E. Weymouth who had two sons at the front spoke in support of Mr Gallagher.  Donations will be sought widely from the community.  Funds in hand were £61-5-4 plus some collected in the past week, making £79-16-1 in all.  It was decided to present Messrs R. Ockenden, Syd Williams and Cardigan Jones with a wallet at a social evening on 18 July at the Oddfellows Hall, Aberdeen.
