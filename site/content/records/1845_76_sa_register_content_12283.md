SA Mining Association.  [Editorial]

The Directors affirm that this report ‘will bear favourable comparison with its predecessors.  The yield of the Mine continues undiminished.  The 7,423 tons of ore raised in the past six months is 1,119 tons more than the quantity raised in any six month period in the last seven years.  The quality has been equal to the usual average, being from 23-24%.  During the last half year the Directors have sold 604 tons of copper in the colony at an average of £98-7-0 per ton.  They have sent a further 540 tons to Britain and India for sale.  The cost of producing 6,304 tons of ore realised was £10-11-0 per ton.  This ore sold at £13-18-4 per ton, leaving a profit of £3-7-8 per ton or 5/11 per ton more than for the preceding six months.  The ascertained undivided profits of the company on 31 March last were £51,436-12-11 and the estimated profits of produced undisposed of amount to £49,494-5-11, making a total profit for division of £93,930-18-9.  The Directors purpose setting apart £24,640 of the ascertained profits of the company for the payment of two dividends of £5 [100%] per share each on 1 June and 3 September next.

The Captain’s report is most favourable and leads to the hope that large quantities of ore will be opened in the lower levels when the new pumping engine, now in the course of erection, is got to work.  The projected profits on the operations to the year ended 30 September last exceeded the best hopes of the Directors.  They hoped for £38,000 and got £43,000.

The Company now employs 1,125 men and boys, representing a population of at least 3,000 persons, or one-fortieth of the population of the colony.  This number does not include the wood-cutters and carters, or the ore carters, or those engaged by the Smelting Company.  The influence of this enterprise spreads far beyond those persons mentioned above; it stimulates mercantile activity in towns and districts across the colony.  The rate of wages paid by the Company ranges from £1-7-0 to £4-16-0 per week.  Common labourers get the lowest figure and some of the engineers the highest.  Miners obtain from 35/- to 45/- per week.

Mr Archibald Jaffrey was elected a Director in place of Mr Thomas Waterhouse, who has resigned his position.  The four other retiring Directors, Messrs Arthur Blyth, William Peacock (Chairman), Thomas Graves and John Charles Boord, were all re-elected.
