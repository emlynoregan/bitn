New Mode of Smelting Copper Ore

The Yatala Smelting Works near the Alberton railway station have been idle for a long time.  Now a portion of the building is occupied by Mr R.V. Rodda, a son of the late Captain Rodda.  He is experimenting with a new way of smelting copper and other ores.  The patented method controls the temperature so as to fuse the metal without melting the other minerals contained in the ore.  The ore is then crushed and washed; the latter process separates out the copper, which is then sent to the refinery.  Mr Rodda is being helped by Mr John David, a practical copper smelter, who expresses himself astonished at the results.  The ore being used is from Kapunda and contains 33% copper.  Mr Rodda now intends to try some poor ore from Burra at 3 to 9%.  Though not yet perfected, he has hopes that the process will make great savings in time and expense.
