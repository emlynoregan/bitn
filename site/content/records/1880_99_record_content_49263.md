Election Meeting: Saturday night it was the turn of Messrs Duncan and Pascoe.

Mr Duncan:

He declared he was an independent in favour of the Government purchasing workingmen’s blocks near centres of population where other work could be got.  He favoured water conservation.  He wanted no more railways unless clearly profitable.  Free trade must come before federation.  He supported a Conciliation Bill to prevent strikes.  Payment for MPs should end.  He opposed Royal Commissions and Select Committees.  He also opposed a progressive land tax.

Mr Pascoe:

He did not support a progressive land tax, but favoured a wealth tax. He supported Intercolonial free trade and believed it would lead to federation.  He was not in favour of local option.  He was for the eight-hour system and was an independent candidate.  He was for payment of MPs.
