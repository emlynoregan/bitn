Australia Day

Rosemary Opperman was Burra’s Citizen of the Year.

Darren Boulger was Young Citizen of the Year.

George Kaiser, Officer in Charge at Burra, accepted the award for local police who organised ‘150 Years of Policing in Burra’, which was Event of the Year.

Australia Day celebrations were held in Market Square, with a breakfast from 7.30 a.m.

Rosemary Opperman was nominated for her hard work as co-ordinator of the Burra Ambulance Service.

Darren Boulger was nominated (after a gap of three years with no nominations in this category) for being so instrumental in getting ‘The Miners Revolution’ up and running – this was an event staged on the night of the Burra Show.  And for his involvement with the SES, the Arts Council and the family business.

Concerts associated with ‘150 Years of Policing in Burra’ resulted in cheques being presented to the Burra SES, National Trust, Ambulance and Burra Blue Light.  [4 photos.]
