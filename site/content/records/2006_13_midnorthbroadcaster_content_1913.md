Brenda Taplin Secretary of the Burra Town Hall Committee writes to thank all who made the re-opening of the Town Hall such a success over the weekend of the 13, 14 & 15 October.  She was, however, dismayed to learn that a rumour was circulating that $1.2 million of ratepayersâ€™ money was spent on re-vamping the Town Hall.  In fact less than $15,000 was used and that came from a couple of generous donations and hire of the hall.  Most work was done by volunteers and anyone with a query is welcome to look over the books with the treasurer Mr Murray Tiver.
