Burra Parks

A new Friends of Parks group is being formed to help conserve the national parks reserves in the Burra area, such as Caroona Creek, Redbanks, Mokota and Pandappa.  The parks are quite diverse in nature.

Pandappa lies east of Terowie and grades from rocky hill country to chenopod scrubland and mallee.  It covers 1,100 ha and is noted for its birdlife.

Caroona grades from spectacular rocky ridges with great views of the eastern rangelands to mallee vegetation and scrubland intersected by creek lines with fresh water springs and plenty of bird and animal life.

Mokota is 500 ha of grassland with more than 200 species of native plants, some of them rare and threatened.  Wild flowers are abundant in late winter and spring.

Redbanks contains Baldina Creek with mallee and wildlife.  Fossils of note have been found in the area.  There is a designated camping area.

Friends of Parks could become involved in conservation of historic and fossil sites, revegetation, pest management, wildlife management, wildlife surveys, writing and information work, administration, photography and fundraising.  A meeting is scheduled for 5 August.  There are 117 such groups in SA.
