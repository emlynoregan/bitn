He then considers the cost of the reservoir, pump, pump house etc., new well, pipes and 3” main to Market Square etc. to come to £1,900.

The income was estimated:

Sale of 9,000,000 gallons @ 3/- per 1,000 gallons	1350

Sale of excavated material	    50

£1309	*

[* Thus in the paper, though the correct figure would seem to be £1400, and the sale of excavated material would be a once off.]

The annual costs are listed as:

Interest on the loan	125

Wages of the engineer	160

Coal, waste, oil, etc.	400

£712	**
