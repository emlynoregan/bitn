Editorial on the Waterworks.  Summary of the position.  The Mayor waxed hot on the way the deputation was met by the Hon. J.B. Spence, Chief Secretary.

The Requests of the deputation:

As promised by a former Minister they get a statement of the items of cost in the construction of the extension to the Waterworks for the town as the statement received is merely a summary of totals and quite insufficient to prove the correctness of the total which the Council disputes.

Instead of the portion of the old works not used by the railways and now connected with the new works being charged to the Council at more than the annual statements of the Public Works report show the whole to have cost, and more than double their estimated value, a fair price should be fixed for them.

Mr Spence seems to have made up his mind before the deputation came and treated them most unbecomingly.  He told them they would have to take or leave the price set by the Hydraulic Engineer.  The agreement is that the Government shall construct the works and the Council shall have use of them at the cost price.  This attitude is untenable.

The Commissioner also believes that the cost price includes the losses the government made in working the old scheme for the last seven years.  This is too absurd to argue against.  It is dishonest to charge the Council for work done and pipes laid in the railway yard and now used by them apart from the town supply.  We agree the Mayor should not let the matter rest.

Also the Council should consider reducing the rates to encourage higher consumption.  The editor suggests a sliding scale with the 1st 1,000 gallons at 6/-, the 2nd at 5/-, the 3rd at 4/-, the 4th at 3/- with subsequent 1,000-gallon increments at 2/6 each.
