Burra Benevolent Society met on 19 July.  The society lacks the funds to satisfy demand and has established an ‘Investigation Committee’.  This has been caused particularly as a result of someone gaining aid through duplicity.  A call has been made for rugs, clothes etc.  A number of aged and decrepit people need help and the feasibility of getting a district nurse will be investigated.
