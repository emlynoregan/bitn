The Civic Trust awarded a commendation for the restoration of the Bible Christian Chapel in Paxton Square.  It is now the booking office for Paxton Cottages and has a collection of old church furniture in keeping with its history as a Bible Christian Chapel.  It was originally built in 1850 as the first Bible Christian Chapel in Australia.
