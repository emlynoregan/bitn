A Crop Duster pilot crashed his Piper Pawnee plane about 7 km southwest of Burra last week.  The man from Queensland had noticed a damaged wheel after take-off.  After dumping his load of spray chemicals, he tried to land, but touched down on the damaged side of the plane, which then spun round.  The pilot walked away unharmed, but soon afterwards the plane burst into flames and was almost completely destroyed.  [Photo]
