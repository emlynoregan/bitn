Susan Parker wrote a letter condemning Leo Sturman along lines similar to the other correspondents.  She condemned the way in which he made ‘a range of emotive, damning and derogatory observations and predictions about Christianity in general and the local Burra churches in particular’. 

She concluded by wondering whether ‘the Festival may not be something which the Churches would consider to fall within their ongoing “core business”.’
