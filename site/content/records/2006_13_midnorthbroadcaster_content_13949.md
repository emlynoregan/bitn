Lorraine Stevens, Farrell Flat resident, is Burra Ward Citizen of the Year.  She has been nominated for helping the aged over many years.  At age 17 she came to Farrell Flat to care for her six unmarried aunts and uncles for 25 years until they died.  She also catered for visiting relatives and had a very busy time over Christmas.  After that she continued to care for the elderly, working for the Country Home Advocacy Project and for Helping Hand.  Over the years she has assisted over 100 people in the area from Hallett to Waterloo and Burra to Clare and Auburn.  This has meant early morning calls to get people out of bed and late evening visits to put them into bed.  While not the one to take on the roles of President or secretary of organisations, she has consistently been the one to roll up when help was required, when working bees were organised or food etc. was needed for a function or stall.  She has long supported the Farrell Flat Uniting Church, the Ladies’ Fellowship and the Burra Uniting Church Op Shop.  She has also been active in the Royal Flying Doctors Auxiliary, the Women’s and children’s Hospital Auxiliary, Lifeline and the Farrell Flat Management Committee.  She has spent a lifetime caring for others in a selfless way.  [Photo]
