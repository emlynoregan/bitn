Fire Bricks.  Some months ago we advocated a firebrick industry using fire clay from Chalk Cliffs to the east of Burra.  Now a syndicate of a few gentlemen have obtained a lease and intend to set up a business.  The land is close to the railway.

[This seems confused unless it suggests a kiln near the railway as distinct from the source of clay which was east of the town and therefore not near the railway.]
