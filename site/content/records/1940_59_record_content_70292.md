Burra-Adelaide Road

In reply to a question in Parliament the Minister of Roads, Mr N.L. Jude MLC, said that at present bituminous roads run from Adelaide to Marrabel via Kapunda and from Adelaide to Saddleworth via Tarlee.  A sub-base [for sealing] has been completed from Saddleworth to Manoora and from Burra to Hanson.  Once reasonable lengths of sub-base have been made by Councils, the departmental gangs will seal the surface.  The proposal is for a sealed road to Burra via Manoora, Black Springs and Hanson.
