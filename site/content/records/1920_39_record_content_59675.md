Kooringa Methodist Sunday School held a picnic on Monday after a lapse of three years (due to the preference of the scholars for a Christmas Tree Party.)  It was held at Gum Creek near the shearers’ quarters, which were used for meals – much appreciated as a cool haven on the extremely hot day.  About 125 children attended and gained great pleasure from cray fishing, paddling and swimming in the morning and sports in the afternoon.
