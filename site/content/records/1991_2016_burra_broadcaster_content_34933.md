Letter.  Rev. Frank Tuppin also responded to say that Mr Sturman was wrong in his assumptions and that most church members were heavily involved in other community groups.

But ‘…since we were not invited to share in the formation of this vision, we should be given the grace to respond as any other organization would as to the extent or willingness of our involvement.  I apologize on behalf of the Uniting Church for not responding sooner to the Wheal Committee’s request for support.’
