Mr Wells wondered if other people would be treated the same way and be provided with drying grounds.

The Mayor deprecated the trend of the discussion.

If they were dissatisfied they should accept Cr Ridgway’s suggestion and nominate someone else.

Cr Tiver proposed Mr Wells.

Mr Wells wanted time to consider - he said he was over age.

Mr Lane thought only Council could accept the resignation.

The Mayor agreed.

Cr Ridgway said he wanted them not to torment him another year and desired they ask him either to resign or to continue in office.

Cr Tiver thought it unkind of Mr Wells to raise matters without notice.

[In view of Cr Ridgway’s claim below that he had his resignation already written out, these questions may not have been so completely without notice as Cr Tiver suggests.]

The Finance Committee had done sterling work and the finances were never in a healthier state.  In the year the North Ward had made 107 chains of new road and 183 chains of footways, had maintained 23 chains of road and 32 chains of footways, and spent not less than £300 in various parts of the town.  Had Mr Wells waited on Council they would have done what he wanted.

(Mr Wells protested that he had spoken repeatedly to both Councillors.)

Mr Fuss would like to know where the work had been done: it was all-lopsided.

The Mayor said it was about equal in Redruth and Aberdeen.

Mr Fuss said he had assured himself there was much discontent and those who complained had acted honourably in saying so.

Mr Motley moved a vote of thanks in the two North Ward Councillors.  Mr Rabbich 2nd.

Mr Pinch moved censure of the two Councillors as an amendment.  Mr Linkson 2nd.

The amendment was carried 15 to 6 with many abstentions.

Cr Ridgway said he had his resignation written out and would be relieved to live in peace and quiet.

Cr Tiver thanked them [ironically] for two year’s wages.
