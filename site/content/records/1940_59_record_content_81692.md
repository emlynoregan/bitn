Burra Town Council, 2 June

Oates Ltd has asked permission to erect two Ezybuilt houses for a client on a block in Paxton Terrace.  Cr Cummins wanted Council to seek advice from the Municipal Association about whether these houses had posed problems in other areas.

[In a later section J.R. Carpenter advises that his Ezybuilt house would be the rear portion of a house with a concrete brick and iron building to be the front portion within five years and for this permission was given.]

The Burra RSL writes accepting the transfer of the [WWI] Honour Roll.

A special rate of 4d in the pound was struck from 1 July to act as security for the Â£6,000 loan to cover Town Hall improvements.
