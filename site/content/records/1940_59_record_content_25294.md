Weather.  Burra recorded 410 points from Saturday night to Monday at 9 a.m., making it the heaviest February fall on record, beating the previous record of 342 points in 1928.  353 points fell in January 1941.  On that occasion the rain fell rapidly, causing the creeks to flood.  This time the rain fell steadily and there was no flooding.  Telephone lines to the east are cut, but it is reported that water is lying everywhere in that district.  Wheat farmers with standing crops will be the only losers.  Falls to hand include:

Mt Bryan 399, Booborowie 289, Hanson 330, Koomooloo 341, Woolgangi 315, Baldina 450, Collinsville 364, Farrell Flat 450, Mt Bryan East 400, Poonunda 475, Sturt Vale 168 and Quondong 128.
