Burra Town Council

Council next meeting is to adopt a by-law making it an offence to ride within the Corporation area behind the driver of a motor or push cycle.

On the motion of Cr Broderick it was decided to swing the electric lamp in Queen St in the centre of the road.

Cr Radford said the negotiations with Mr James Reed about supplying an electric light for the Exchange Corner and one for the telephone box were proceeding.  The amount for the installation would be £25 and the Council would have to supply the poles.  The cost seemed heavy, but in the long run electricity would be cheaper than carbide.

Cr Bartholomaeus said the Exchange Corner was dangerous and needed a good light and he would second the motion.  [Presumably Cr Radford had moved one, but it is not reported.]

Cr Broderick said Victoria Park’s privies were bad.  Resolved they be attended to.

Cr Broderick moved the Holder Garden be left in the hands of the Misses Pearce who had offered to attend to it.  Carried.

Cr Kellaway moved that Council workers get half pay when sick and full pay only for accidents.  Carried.
