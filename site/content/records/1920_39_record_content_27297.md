Burra Town Council, 21 June

Harry W. Wilkins thanked the Council for its letter re Sir George Wilkins.

Graham Dow was appointed auditor in place of Boz Pearce on account of the latter’s ill health.

The Deputy Post Master General advises that the public phone at the station will be reinstated if the Council is prepared to make up any deficit below £16 – the recent average yearly takings have been between £1 & £2.  Council will take no further action.

R. Fuss granted permission to extend a shed at the rear of Goldsbrough, Mort & Co.

Plans for the Vacuum Oil Co. Depot at Aberdeen were approved.

An enlarged photograph of Mr J. McLaren, former Mayor, has been received and will be hung.

The previous resolution agreeing for Council to be trustees for the Aberdeen Croquet Club if they paid rates and taxes was rescinded to enable the club to be put on an equal basis with other clubs in the town.  The land will be treated as parklands.

Cr Riggs then moved the Croquet Club be granted a 99-year lease and they be responsible only for excess water rates.  Carried.

Discussion on road metal supply followed and on the need for bags to ease the mud problem around new graves in the wet.  Gravel is to be got for cemetery paths.
