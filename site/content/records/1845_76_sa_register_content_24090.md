Obituary.  [The obituary of D.J. H. Ibbetson is reprinted using substantially the same text but with the following corrections and additions.]

Mr Ibbetson was born at Beckenham near Bromley in Kent.  After education at Putney College he was employed for some years by Mr J. Fowler and had a considerable length of the Manchester-Sheffield line, then in the course of construction, under his charge.  Mr Fowler greatly valued his zeal as resident engineer, but Me Ibbetson was never his partner.  Disagreement arose in connection with the fracture of a girder bridge, which Mr Ibbetson had condemned in the foundry, but which had been passed by another engineer, and also over Mr Ibbetson’s refusal to attend to business on a Sunday.  This hindered his advance in the engineering profession and he was encouraged by an old friend, Dr Jelf, to join the Anglican ministry.  He was introduced to the Bishop of Adelaide, then in England, and after a course of study at King’s College was ordained by the Bishop of London at St Paul’s Cathedral.  He arrived in SA about 18 years ago.  The funeral will take place this afternoon at West Adelaide Cemetery.
