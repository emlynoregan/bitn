Obituary.  Mrs John A. Riggs died at her residence ‘Hughendon’ on 16 April aged 84.  She was born at Houghton SA 26 December 1852, a daughter of Mr & Mrs Benjamin Smith.  At 23 she married Mr John Andrew Riggs at Gawler when he was managing Murkaby Station for his brother, Henry Riggs of Gawler.  In 1880 Mr Riggs took up land at Mullaby near Burra and in 1891 he was granted a portion of Murkaby and also country further out, Lord’s Well & Bazentin Stations, now held by some of the sons, and the family moved to Kooringa.  Mrs Riggs fought alongside her husband the elusive conditions of drought and plenty and maintained her vigour and mentality to the end.  She was a member of Kooringa Methodist Church and a liberal supporter of its causes.  Her husband died 4 July 1922.  Two sons predeceased her: Elliott late of the AIF died on active service and Eddie Riggs in 1920.  There are five surviving sons and four daughters: J. Arthur Riggs (Kooringa), Alfred B. Riggs (Murkaby & Aberdeen), Herbert & Vernon Riggs (Bazentin & Lord’s Well), Frank Riggs (Meadows South), Mrs Frank J. Pearce (Payneham), Mrs Edgar Pearce (Kooringa), Mrs Arthur Kellock (Kooringa) & Mrs John Venn (Perth WA).  There are 18 grandchildren & 2 great-grandchildren.  The funeral on Sunday was very largely attended.  [Born Elizabeth Smith.]
