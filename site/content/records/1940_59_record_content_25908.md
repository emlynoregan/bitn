The Mid North Local Government Conference was held at the Burra Town Hall on Wednesday.  There were delegates from eighteen councils.  The Mayor of Burra, T.H. Woollacott, welcomed delegates and Mr Bails, Mayor of Clare, chaired the meeting.

A motion was passed calling for a bigger share of petrol tax to be directed to district roads.  In 1928-29 22% went to consolidated revenue and 78% to roads, but in 1943-44 78% went to consolidated revenue and 22% to roads.

The Premier was commended on getting the State Electricity Bill passed.

There was a call to have all cows in the state tested for TB.

Mayor Woollacottâ€™s motion that the Commonwealth be induced to expedite the acquisition of land or individual farms for land settlement was carried.

[The complaint was that big landowners and companies were buying up land that should have gone in smaller amounts to returned servicemen.  Cr Kellaway said he knew of one local area that used to support seventeen families, but today was occupied by about six.]

A motion calling for women to be barred from certain industries was carried.  There were a lot of returned men with physical disabilities who required lighter jobs and they were being kept out by women.

A motion calling for the appointment of civil engineers by country councils (moved by Clare Corporation) was turned down.

The addition of foxes and Bladder Ketmia (Hibiscus Trionium) to the Noxious Weed & Vermin Act was recommended.

A decision on attitudes to betting legislation was deferred.

It was recommended motor vehicles be able to be registered at local police stations or in country towns.

The Agriculture Department was called on to enforce regulations regarding the dipping of sheep.
