Proposed Redruth Church of England

On 1 September a public meeting of members and friends of the Church of England took place in the Redruth Court House to consider the desirability of building a church at Redruth.  Mr Joseph Genders occupied the chair.  Rev. D.J.H. Ibbetson opened the meeting with a prayer.  Various proposed sites were discussed, but the unanimous conclusion was that the one secured to them through the kindness of William Paxton was the best; that is allotments 82 & 92 in Redruth.  A committee was formed to advance the project.  Advertisements are to be placed in the Register, the Observer and the Chronicle newspapers to call for funds, along with 300 circulars.  The next committee meeting will be on 22 September Rev. Ibbetson said an account had been opened at the Union Bank in Adelaide and £140 had already been promised, including £50 by the Lord Bishop of Adelaide from funds at his disposal.  A large number of circulars had been distributed in Adelaide and some sent to England.  The meeting was characterised by a zeal, unanimity and fixedness of purpose not easily surpassed.
