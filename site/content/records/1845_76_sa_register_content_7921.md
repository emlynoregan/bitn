Mt Alexander Diggings

A.R. writes a letter to a gentleman in Adelaide.

[He says they were four days sailing to Melbourne and four days by bullock cart getting from Melbourne to the diggings.  (80 miles.)  Two days after arriving they began sinking.  There were 1,000 men sinking on the same hill.  After a week they had a hole 20 feet deep.  Many got nothing, but they were lucky and recovered 2 pounds of gold.  They expect to finish in another week.  He considers that of all those there, 5% are making their fortunes, 45% make good wages and 50% are starving.  Hundreds are arriving daily from Adelaide and half stop only a day or two.  He reports hundreds of Adelaide people starving.  He then gives specific information about individuals.]
