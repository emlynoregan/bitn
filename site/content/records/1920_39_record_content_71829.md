Weather.  Bountiful rain fell in the last week and extended to the pastoral country.  Falls of just less than 1 inch to 1½ are reported, but for some areas communication has been cut since the 20th.  Falls in the farming areas were about 1½ inches.  Burra got 155 points.  On Wednesday a severe hail storm swept across Baldina Station with the largest hailstones seen there.  Crops are now looking good and pastoral prospects are pleasing.  Dust Holes Creek tried to run twice, but the sand absorbed it.  The third time it succeeded quite well.
