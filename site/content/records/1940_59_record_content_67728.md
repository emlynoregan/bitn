Thefts.  During the week three business premises were broken into in Burra and goods and money were stolen.  Failed attempts at entry were reported from two other shops.  Mr Smith of Paxton Square noticed signs of attempted entry at Ken. Murphy’s Tobacconist at 8.15 a.m. on Monday and investigations showed Jennison’s Tyre Service, Davies’ Motor Garage and Water’s Café had all been entered and an attempt had been made at W.E.D. Young’s office.  The proprietors of each business were absent at the time of the attempts.
