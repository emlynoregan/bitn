Burra Town Council, 3 November

Cr Woollacott announced his intention to resign to stand as Mayor.  A letter from Mr Bednall (solicitor) expressed the view that he could not stand for Mayor without resigning and that under the circumstances the Council should remit the fine.  [Which could be up to £25.]

Cr Kellaway would also be a candidate and so both would be Councillors and candidates for Mayor up to the election, though Cr Kellaway’s term was expiring this year.

Cr Allen thought Cr Woollacott should resign immediately.

[There is no indication in the paper of how this case was resolved – presumably he did not follow Cr Allen’s wishes.]

Cr Kellaway pointed out that if he did not resign till the election then his extraordinary vacancy would occasion a special election.

Since the Council meeting we understand Mr Bednall has varied his position and now believes Cr Woollacott can stand for Mayor without resigning as Councillor.

[It is a little odd that this became an issue in 1930 given that parallel situations had arisen before with Councillors standing for Mayor in the middle of their term as Councillor.

Edward Lipsett (end of 1877), E.C. Lockyer (end of 1881), P.L. Killicoat (end of 1887), E.W. Crewes (end of 1909 and M. Collins (end of 1922).  Edward Lipsett’s action occasioned a special election, but the others produced elections held concurrently with the other Council Elections for the year.]
