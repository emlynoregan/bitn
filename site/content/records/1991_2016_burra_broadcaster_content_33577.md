Obituary.  Eric McKenna died on 3 April.  He was an art and antique dealer who started in the second hand business in Burra, with a shop in what is now known as the Pharaoh’s Tomb and Burra Antique Centre in 1955*.  Later he moved to Adelaide, where he continued to deal in art and antiques.

[I would not place great reliance on this date.  Topsfield’s Butcher shop was in that building and was still operating when Topsfield’s sold their business to F. & J. McLean in 1972.  Check on the possibility of the small shop immediately north of the butcher’s.  There is an advertisement for a sale for McKenna in November 1955, which may indicate when he left.]
