The main public work was the Kooringa [Kingston St] bridge which was supposed to be paid for by the Govt. but the superintending surveyor said there were insufficient funds so the Corporation had to expend £84 which we have endeavoured to recoup. (So far unsuccessfully) With the approach costs the bridge has cost us £394-5-10. The closing of the old ford led to the need to drain Market Square which has been commenced by watertabling both sides of Thames St, round the Square, both sides of Chapel St, Queen St and Commercial St and making a cross drain in Mt Pleasant St to turn water from the hill down Chapel St. We have begun to level Market Square from side to side. Other roads made include: - Bridge Terrace, part of Kingston St, Welsh Place, Ayers St and Chapel St as far as the creek. A footpath has been formed to the hospital and from near the National Bank to the Post Office. Merthyr St from the Aberdeen Hotel to the bridge has been made and other watertabling done in Aberdeen and Redruth. Many approaches to the main roads have been made because this is the last occasion on which the Road Board would pay a moiety. Council has closed the road from Mr Cave's to Roach Town and opened a direct road from Mr Fuss's [i.e. H.C.W. Fuss's in Llwchwr] to the same point.
