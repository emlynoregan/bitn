PEACE

News that the armistice had been signed reached Burra about 9.30 p.m. Monday evening.

The news was announced by ringing the fire bell and soon there was a regular pandemonium of noise and within fifteen minutes Market Square was crowded and the Ladies and Men’s Bands combined for the National Anthem and then the Doxology was sung.  Cheers were given for Our Boys, The Allies, General Foch and The King.  The Mayor and Mr Winnall gave short speeches and the bands played patriotic airs.  It was the early hours of morning before calm returned.  Tuesday was observed as a holiday and the town was decorated with flags and by 10.30 a.m. the square was crowded and a platform had been erected.

A procession of nearly 1,000 thankful men, women and children extended the length of Commercial St from Messrs C.J. Pearce & Son to E.J. Harris’s, headed by the Returned Soldiers, the Mayor, Councillors, the town’s Ministers and the combined bands.  Cheer after cheer greeted the returned men and Lieut. Phillis made a suitable speech.  A short thanksgiving service followed.

After a moving speech the Mayor read the official telegram from the Premier.  There were brief speeches from Rev. H.H. Hopton, W.G. Hawkes, Rev. D.B. Bridgwood, Mr Winnall and Rev. A.J. Finch.  In the afternoon the Men’s Band played in the street.
