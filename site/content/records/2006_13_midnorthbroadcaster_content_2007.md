Laurie Sullivan is retiring after serving on the Hallett DC and the Regional Council of Goyder for more than 20 years, the last three as Mayor.  He would like to have seen the Burra Industrial Area in place by now and the Bower Precinctâ€™s intensive farming area further advanced and he regrets the failure of the Burra Market Square/Best Place improvement project.  He favoured the Council amalgamation and the reduction in the number of Councillors from 12 to 7.
