Fanny McWaters was charged on the information of M-C Clarke with attempting to murder herself on 16 November by throwing herself down a well in Paxton Square.  Clarke said he was asked to go and see about getting Mrs McWaters out of it.  He descended the well and the woman was subsequently brought up.  She said she had committed the act because she expected Cummings home and there was no food in the house for the children.  She was not called to give evidence and was bound over to keep the peace for six months on her own recognisance of Â£5.
