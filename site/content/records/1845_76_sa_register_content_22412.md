Burra Branch of the Bible Society

The annual meeting was held at the Bible Christian Chapel on Friday 23 October.  The report said there had been no meeting in 1867 because the deputation had returned to Adelaide on the arrival of the Duke of Edinburgh, before reaching Burra.  The two years covered by the report had not been nearly as successful as the year before when the subscriptions amounted to £211 and £200 had been sent to the parent auxiliary.  The income for the two years had been £179-0-1, including £4-18-5 carried forward from 1865.  Of this £132-1-3 had been collected and £42-0-5 came from sales by the depository.  This was dispersed: £60 was a free donation to the Adelaide Auxiliary; £33-10-0 was paid out for books and after working expenses £68-11-5 was in hand.  Returns for the present year were incomplete and the committee recommended a payment of £100 [to the Adelaide Auxiliary].  Reference was made to the stoppage of the Burra Mine having affected the funds.
