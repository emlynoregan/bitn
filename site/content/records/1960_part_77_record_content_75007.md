The wool sales in September saw values slide a further 15-17½% with the average bale fetching $176 at the last sale – a slight improvement.  There was a year of record rainfall resulting in huge losses in pastoral areas due to blowfly attacks and more recently from grass seeds and worms.  Some producers say this combination has been more worry than a drought.  The bushfire hazard has been extreme.
