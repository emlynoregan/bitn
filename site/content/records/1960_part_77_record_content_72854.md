Bezaliel Gollin – information from Ian Auhl.

Gollin seems to have arrived in Burra in 1848 and joined the firm of Marks, very early storekeepers in Burra.  The firm became Marks & Gollin.  Gollin appears as foreman of nearly every court case from 1848 to 1851, including a murder or two.  The Register reports Queen Victoria’s 31st birthday when Gollin hoisted the City of London banner from his flagpole and soon flags were flying everywhere in honour of the sovereign.  On the 1849 map Mr White noticed Marks and Gollin on a couple of blocks.  Mr Marks lived between Kangaroo and Ware Streets where the Walkleys now live.  Bezaliel Gollin lived on a block on Ayers Street where Les Broad & family now reside.
