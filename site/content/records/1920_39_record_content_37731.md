The site is now owned by Mr R. Voumard who is said still to have its signboard.

The Smelters Arms stood at the north end of the town adjoining Aberdeen.  It was busy while the smelters operated and large quantities of firewood were continually going past.  When operations ceased it was sold by the directors to the Opie family who changed its name to Opie’s hotel and they retained it up to the Government’s closing of hotels in Burra when it passed into the ownership of Mr Robert Fuss who uses it for residential and business purposes.

[The ownership prior to R. Fuss’s purchase was a little more complicated than the above would suggest.  The licence was transferred in 1917 to the Booborowie Hotel.]

There was another hotel further up the creek in Aberdeen.  The mine built a crossing for drays between the Mine and the Smelting Works near the Mine Bridge.  This and the slimes continually arriving from the mine during heavy rain on one occasion held back flood waters and flooded the lower portion of the hotel and the owner claimed damages from the mine owners.  They denied liability, but when legal action commenced their licensed surveyor showed the entrance to the hotel cellars and the ford were on a level and they settled out of court.

[This needs further confirmation, but would seem to refer to the White Hart Hotel.]

Treloar then recounts three stories.  One is of a man who spent too much time and money at ‘The Pig’ and got angry enough to smash up the household furniture, which his wife then made into a Cornish pasty to his surprise when he opened up his lunch.  Another tells of two boys who rolled a drunk into a butcher’s cart and let a goat into a lady’s garden.  (The butcher was called Uhlmann.)  The third tells of the influence of a cask of free ale on the election of Dr Nesbitt to Council and Drew’s and Lipsett’s started a slaughter sale of top hat that resulted in their being worn by all the fun-makers in the town and that practically killed off the wearing of top hats in Burra.
