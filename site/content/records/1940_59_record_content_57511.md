Noel Tiver corrects details in the political life of Sir Philip McBride.  P.A. McBride was not defeated while a Member of the House of Representatives, but he nominated for and was elected to the Senate and then at the following election lost his Senate seat in a landslide.  Three years later he won the seat of Wakefield for the LCL.  The reference to winning the seat of Wakefield in the Senate must be an error as a Senator represents the whole state.
