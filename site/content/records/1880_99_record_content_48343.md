Cr Parks reported the Waterworks breakage and thought the engineer deserved credit for his efforts to get it repaired and water restored.  He had authorised the employment of Mr Bartle to read meters, as the engineer was otherwise very busy.  The Mayor said the engineer was working from 4 or 5 a.m. to 7 or 8 p.m. and that was enough for any man.
