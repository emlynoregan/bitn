Obituary.  Death in Redruth Gaol

An inquest was held at Redruth Gaol on 24 November into the death of Algernon G. Johnson, a prisoner who had been received at the gaol the previous Saturday on a charge of larceny and who was suffering from the effects of long and excessive drinking.  On Saturday the authorities had thought the deceased was suffering from delirium tremens because he made no complaints.  On Sunday morning the doctor saw that his leg was in such a bad state that there was little hope of his surviving.  J. Drew JP was coroner and E.P. Fisher the foreman.

Thomas Perry, Keeper of the Redruth Gaol, said deceased had been sent from Riverton on 20 November for trial at the Supreme Court, charged with breaking into Mr Ausell’s cellar at Saddleworth and stealing two bottles of whisky and some liqueurs.  He was suffering from the effects of drink.  When he did not approve, sent for the doctor who attended the next morning.  Deceased had bruises, called doctor’s attention to his leg and deceased had fomentations and the doctor’s directions were carried out.  Johnson complained of being sore through falls occasioned by drinking.  He said he had fallen into a creek at Riverton when with his wife.  He said the injury to his leg was sustained before his arrival at the gaol.

George W. Goodhart JP, Visiting Justice to Redruth Gaol, said he saw the deceased the day before his death.  He then had no complaints about his treatment at the gaol, but had some against the trooper who arrested him.  He appeared quite sensible and said he was getting better.  Saw deceased on the day of his death between 10 and 11 a.m. when he made the following statement:

‘I, Algernon Johnson, otherwise George Johnson, came in the colony fifteen years ago, I am accused of stealing four bottles of spirits of wine, of which I have no recollection.  I am not sure how I hurt my leg.  Think it has been in my blood a long time.  I think the least twist or accident might have brought it on.  I fell down a creek two or three times.  Very likely I hurt myself then.  Am certain it is an internal injury.  Have been used to very hard work and when at work I worked too heavy.  Have had great nervousness come over me this last 12 months, but never had it so bad before.  Have no blame to attach to anyone I know of.  Am sure if I went on much longer I should not be ‘countable’ for my actions.  It has already affected my brain.  When I fell down the creek I was walking with my wife to a neighbour’s.  I did not take much notice of it at the first.  Have had much knocking about and falling from horses.  Would not like to blame anyone for the injuries I have received.  Do not seem to know what I am doing half my time.  If I go into a strange place I do not know what I am doing.  I know I am a different man to what I was three years ago.  I have been very well treated since I have been in the Gaol.  Could not have been better.  It upset me a good deal not being able to walk on my foot.  Had been drinking at the same house that I was charged with stealing the spirits from.  I make this statement and am certain that it is true.

A.G. Johnson.’

Dr William Peel Nesbitt said he saw the patient Sunday morning when he was suffering from the effects of drinking and injury.  He complained of his head and several bruises, but said his leg did not pain him.  Examined the leg which was much swollen.  Considered his case hopeless.  Saw him daily after that.  For the last two or three days he was sensible, though suffering the effects of drink.  He could give no account of how his leg came to be bad. It must have been so for some days before his admission to the gaol.  Death was due to blood poisoning and diffuse cellulitis.  He was in delirium tremens on Sunday morning.  Saw no marks on his wrists to indicate he had been badly used by the police-trooper.  Should judge the injury to his leg occurred prior to his arrest.

Robert Dunn, another prisoner, who had nursed the deceased, corroborated the kindly treatment of the deceased at the gaol, as did John Cleary, another prisoner.

The Jury found that death was due to blood poisoning due to excessive drinking.

After the verdict Trooper Campbell, the arresting officer arrived from Riverton by train.  He said the deceased had been drinking for a fortnight before his arrest and had been lying out and wandering about.  He had been arrested on Wednesday and behaved quietly until being committed for trial on Friday.  After that he became excited and violent.  On his return to the police cell he struggled violently with the trooper, wrenched the handle off the cell bucket and with it made a hole through the cell wall, broke the side off his stretcher and struck at the witness.  The trooper used no unnecessary force in dealing with deceased, who had complained of a stiffness and peculiar feeling in his leg when first arrested.

The coroner on behalf of the jury thanked Mr Perry for the humane manner in which he had attended the deceased.

[Algernon George Johnson died 24 November 1875 Redruth, residence Riverton aged 34.]
