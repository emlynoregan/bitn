Letter.  Ada Barkell of Booborowie writes deriding the idea that 85-100 people in Burra earned their living from tourist related jobs.  She is tired of all the positive hype centred on the tourism industry and calls upon the editor to check his facts.

The editor replied with the following income sources:

24 Bed & Breakfast

14 hotel, motel and caravan park staff

20 eating services

5 tourist office staff

8 National Trust guides

10 second hand shops

12 various other shops

And perhaps 30 to 40 in casual employment like cleaning and waiting staff etc.

30% of Burra Community Press income (equivalent to 1 full-time position) is tourist related.
