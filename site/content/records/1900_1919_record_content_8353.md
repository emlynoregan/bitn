Young offenders Williams and Morrison were released from Magill Reformatory last week and then taken back again.  Something is wrong!

The boys were delivered to Superintendent Mr Gray, but after several days he decided that a mistake had been made in the mandates forwarded and that the justices had made an error.  The parents were advised to come and take charge of the boys.  Mrs Bennett could not afford the trip and Morrison could ill afford it, but he went down and brought the boys back.  The police and justices expressed surprise and asked for an explanation.  Before this could be given Mr Gray arrived and had the boys re-arrested and took them back Friday afternoon.  He paid Morrison for the expenses incurred.  The boys were understandably much cut up by this series of events.  It seems a shoddy way of doing business and a cruel way to treat the lads.  An enquiry is called for.
