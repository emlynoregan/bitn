Election meeting at Kooringa

Dr Maurau chaired a meeting on Saturday evening for Mr G.S. Kingston, but the room was filled with partisans for both candidates.

Mr Kingston:

Was in favour of continuing grants in aid – at least for country schools.

They could perhaps be discontinued in the city and suburbs where schools could be self supporting.

Teachers would not be allowed to inculcate sectarian opinions, but the Bible might be read without comment.

He supported the principle of immigration, but would not bring out migrants when the labour market was already oversupplied.

In the Register Mr Dale was reported as saying that Mr Neales had insisted that workers be paid 16/- a day when he had big building works underway and the master builders threatened to stop work in order to lower wages.  This was not true.  Mr Neales had no building contracts under way at that time and like most men built when wages were affordable and stopped when they rose to 16/- a day.

Mr Kingston endeavoured to explain that he had reduced the expenditure on the Redruth Bridge in order that the £300 saved might be expended on the approaches.

Mr Neales had said that he (Kingston) had absented himself from the House when the mineral leases were being discussed.  This was a disgraceful accusation, as Neales knew that on that day his wife had died.  He disapproved of the present mineral leasing arrangements, which favoured the capitalist over the working man.

Mr Dale then mounted the platform and the meeting became a scene of confusion and disorder.  A question and Kingston’s answer could not be heard.

Mr Dale accused Kingston of having told certain tradesmen that Dale had been paid by Dr Browne for supporting the Land Bill.  Kingston said he did not recall doing so, but he was in the House when Dr Browne admitted having spent £10 in expenses to Gawler and Hindmarsh, when he had been accompanied by Mr Dale as supporter of this measure.

Dale then read a letter from Dr Browne denying any payment to Dale for his support.

Kingston’s response could not be heard in the confusion that followed.  After a period of personal recriminations and so much noise that no coherent understanding of proceedings was possible, Mr Dale moved a want of confidence in Mr Kingston and this was carried.  After cheers for Neales and groans for his opponent the meeting abruptly ended without even a vote of thanks to the chairman for his services.
