Mr George Scott, head of Burra Public School, has been enthusiastic about forming a cadet corps at the school.  It would be a branch of the Commonwealth Corps of SA.  Boys must be over 12 and at least 4’6” in stocking feet.  Uniforms cost 17/- and Government provides 7/6 on each uniform.  The required numbers have come forward.

McGilchrist & Co. have decided to erect a large showroom on the western side of their present premises.  The company has an extensive stock of cricket, golf, tennis, croquet and other sporting equipment.

Burra Orchestra & Madam Amy Sherwin & Co. will present a grand concert on Monday 22 October in the Burra Institute.  4/-, 3/-, 2/-. 

Albert March, aged 11, had a lucky escape from death when a length of railway line suspended from the rafters in their horse shed, fell at one end and pinned him to the ground by the head.  He suffered a broken nose and was at times delirious.  Had the other end of the rail fallen he would have been crushed to a pulp.
