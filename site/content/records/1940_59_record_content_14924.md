Aberdeen Ballast Quarry.  A.D. McDonald asked in Parliament why ballast was being sourced further south in a time of rolling stock and coal shortage.

Hon. M. McIntosh replied that the Aberdeen Quarry lacked mechanical appliances and manpower for intermittent work at the site and Burra had no locomotive for shunting purposes and to work the quarry line, but as the Department would soon need 2,000 tons for the broad gauge lines at Terowie the use of the Aberdeen Quarry would be investigated.
