Wolf Creek 2

The filming of Wolf Creek 2 has come to an end at Burra. Last week the penultimate shoot was taken on Wednesday afternoon.  Cast and crew celebrated with dinner at local establishments.  Many locals had access to stars throughout their stay and came away with photographs and autographs.  Emma Noble and Megan Brooks had a day as extras, filming in the Brewery Cellars for the highly anticipated horror flick.  On Thursday the crew headed off to wrap up shooting in Adelaide in a little caravan park.  It is expected that Roadshow will release the film in November or December 2013.
