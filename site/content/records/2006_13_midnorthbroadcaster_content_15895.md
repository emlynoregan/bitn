Weather.  On Monday SA was lashed by thunderstorms, heavy rain and strong winds.  There were more than 173,000 lightning strikes in 24 hours.  The strikes battered the electricity network and sparked grass and scrub fires across the district.  The CFS attended multiple callouts.  Burra recorded only 4 mm of rain.
