Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co.  The 10th half-yearly report showed income of £112 from tributers, and expenses of £1,227-19-8 with proceeds of £334-4-2 for a loss for the half-year of £893-19-2.

In several places in the report large quantities of milling ore are reported as being found, but there is no mention of extracting it or any estimate of its earning potential.  There is no available machinery at the mine to treat milling ore, so what is the point of going after it?  The sale of ore was within £6 of the tributers’ contribution.  In effect it was costing 60/- to get 20/- worth of ore.
