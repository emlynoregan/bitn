The Season.  Locally there was good rain in May, but to the east the drought is serious.  Dams are empty and sheep farmers are having a trying time as the lambing season has begun.  Rumour has it that Mutooroo run has dried out and has been abandoned for the time being.  Other pastoralists are getting very short of water.
