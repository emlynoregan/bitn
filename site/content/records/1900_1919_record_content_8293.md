Juvenile Crime Wave.  Two lads, Snowy Williams and Skinty Morrison, recently stole a fowl from Mr Thomas Sandland on Limestone Hill, along with a nest of eggs.  They entered the house of Mrs Williams in her absence, cleaned, boiled and ate the fowl, followed by the eggs.  They then entered a room let to Mr S. Burns and stole 4/- and a pair of sleeve links.  They spent the money on toffee and beer after which they rounded up horses in the Brewery Paddock and hacked off their hair, which they sold at 1/- for a pound of it.  Mr Martinâ€™s cab horse and other animals also suffered.  They were sent to Magill Reformatory till 18.
