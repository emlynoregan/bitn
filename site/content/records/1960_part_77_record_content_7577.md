Pascoe’s Barber Shop has closed after 73 years.  In 1888 the late R.D. Pascoe began business in the shop now occupied by Messrs R.A. Bevan & Son and later moved to a portion of that now occupied by Bence’s Ltd.  In 1910 the premises now housing the Burra Radio & Electrical Service were taken over and one portion used as a barber shop and the other as a newsagency.  It was at this time that Mr J. (Joe) Pascoe commenced his trade with his father and brother, the late Mr Claude Pascoe.  Another brother, Frank, ran the newsagency and the late Mr O. (Twist) Ockenden was in charge of a branch of the saloon at Aberdeen.  In 1946 following the death of Mr R.D. Pascoe ‘Joe’ carried on the business on his own until five or six weeks ago when ill health caused him to retire and close the hairdressing section of the business.  One interesting feature, which has gradually faded over the years, was the pigeonholes of shaving mugs and brushes.  Years ago the business formed a Shavers’ Club with a membership fee of one shilling a week.  Each member had his own mug and brush in one of the pigeonholes and for the one shilling fee he would be shaved as often as he presented himself during the week.  At one stage there were 184 mugs and brushes.  Going back a year or two ‘Joe’ said haircuts were 6d and shaves 3d and with three chairs in operation it would have been a quiet Friday to have fewer than 40 shaves to do.  Joe still has the razor he used when he first commenced work and though considerably worn down, it could still be used today.  All this has changed with the advent of the safety razor and later the electric razor.  Another well known feature was the collection of sheep photos, which covered the entire four walls.  The collection dates back to 1910 when the late Mr L. Gebhardt of Mokota brought in the first photo to hang in the shop.  Other stud breeders followed suit and after a time it amounted to a very fine collection indeed.
