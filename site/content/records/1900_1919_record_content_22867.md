J. McLaren writes re the removal of the footbridge across the creek opposite the Kooringa Post Office.  The reason given was that two boys had fallen from it.  On this basis the bridge near Henderson’s will also no doubt have to go.  A handrail would have been a more reasonable response.  Now people are forced to go to the bridge near the Burra Hotel with its more dangerous approach.

Children will now cross at the more dangerous slag crossing.  The bridge removed is also the busiest one when events are at Victoria Park.  South of the post office there are four bridges, but north of it none until the Aberdeen [Redruth] Bridge.
