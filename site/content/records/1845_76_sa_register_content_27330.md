Burra Harvest Festival was celebrated on Sunday 29 February.

At St Mary’s Rev. H. Howitt conducted the services.

The Primitive Methodists and the Bible Christians assembled with the Wesleyans in their chapel and the service there was conducted by Revs S. Gray, T. Hillman and G. W. Patchell.  In the afternoon a picnic was held in R. Austin’s paddock about a mile and a half from Kooringa.  The weather was favourable and about 1,000 attended.  The Burra Brass Band enlivened the occasion.  Athletic sports were contested with W.F. Coglin as judge:

200 yards Young Men’s Race	H.A. Holthouse

100 yards Boys’ Race		S. Raymond

100 yards Girls’ Race		Misses Murphy & Lock tied – sharing the prize of a 14 lb tin of lollies.

200 yards race with 3 hurdles	H. Bland

50 yards pickaback race		Hopkins & Fitzgerald

Jumping in Sacks			R. Hopkins

Three-legged Race		Brackenridge & Moyle

Blindfolded Wheelbarrow Race	J. Seymour

1 Mile Race for Allcomers	W. Bland

A cricket match was played with enthusiasm and a bat given to J. Martin as highest scorer and a ball to H. Ware as best bowler.  The sports closed with a donkey race, and chasing the pig and a sheep.

In the evening there was a concert at the Institute Hall.

The proceeds will aid the Burra Hospital Fund.
