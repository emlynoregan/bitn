Rain.  The afternoon train from the north on 3 February was late due to spectacularly heavy rain north of Yarcowie.  The train travelled through water after Yarcowie and in places the water was fence high on the level country.  The train was lucky to get to Hallett.  When the water subsided it was found that a culvert bridge and tons of ballast had been swept away.  Thursday’s Broken Hill express was cancelled beyond Hallett.  On Friday only about 10 points fell in Burra, but at Leighton 160 points fell on Warnes’ & McDonald’s country while neighbours got only a drizzle.  ‘The Gums’ got 179 points in 40 minutes and water was a foot deep all over the run.  Mt Mary got 2 inches and Hugh Warnes at Chalk Cliffs Station reported 220 points in 30 minutes.  Rainfall over most of the eastern country exceeded 1½ inches, varying from 65 points at Oakbank to 3½ inches at Mulga Hill and Bazentin and Sampson’s Well.  Part of Ketchowla reported 4 inches.
