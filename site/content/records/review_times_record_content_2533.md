Jubilee 150 Parade.  Burra will have a float with the theme ‘Burra – saving SA’ in the Adelaide Jubilee Procession on New Year’s Day.  President of Burra National Trust, Mrs Maureen Wright, said the discovery of copper in Burra in 1845 had saved the colony’s ailing finances.  She said the float would probably feature an historic buggy and wagon surrounded by people in the costume of the 1840s.  A meeting to organise Burra’s contribution has been called for 22 August.
