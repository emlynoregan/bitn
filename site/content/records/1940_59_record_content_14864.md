Burra Town Council, 6 September.

The Military acknowledge receipt of the plaque for HMAS Burra-Bra which will be forwarded to the ship.

The balance sheet for the year showed the collection of Â£1,863-19-0 from rates, arrears, fines, etc.

Cr Carpenter said he would not support a motion to reduce the area of Holder Garden.  Both it and Lane Garden were presently a disgrace, but he would rather see them cleaned up at his own expense than see them reduced.

Cr Kellaway blamed the war.

Cr Carpenter said if the fences were removed they would become a romping ground for children and dogs.

Cr Lee said the plan was to keep the cyclone fence and remove the picket fence on the creek side of the garden.

Cr Bevan said it would be dangerous for children who played in the garden.

Cr Lee withdrew his motion pending a Council inspection.
