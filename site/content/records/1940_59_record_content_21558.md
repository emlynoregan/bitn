Obituary.  Arthur Harold (Earle) Bagg died at Burra Hospital on Friday 4 May after a long illness.  He was the youngest son of the late Mr & Mrs Fred Bagg of Baldina, where he was born 4 June 1884.  His father died when the late Mr Bagg was very young and upon leaving school he worked with his brother, E.H.S. Bagg on the family farm.  Owing to ill health, he could not participate in active work or sport.  Later in life he went to Adelaide with his brother and lived there about ten years.  He returned to Burra about three years ago.

[SA Births CD says born 10 June 1884 at Swampy Down near Kooringa.]
