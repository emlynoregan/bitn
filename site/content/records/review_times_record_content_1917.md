Burra Burra DC replies to Mr Woolley’s advertisement in the last issue.  The Council can reply as a property owner and had received 46 notices on its own property.  Values had risen strongly and the Council was facing a change in water rating levels.  The Council felt the assessment to be equitable over the whole district.  Council felt a mighty rise in rates was no on and the rating level would be held as close to present levels as possible.  ‘The Council is in the position of being shot at by members of the community too lazy to research their facts before sounding off.’

The Council’s new assessment will not be adopted till after 30 June 1978 and will include any adjustments made as the result of landowners’ objections.
