H. McDonald, late agent for the Shearers’ Union writes at more length explaining how the misunderstanding over W. Killicoat’s debt of £2-5-0 occurred.  It seems that neither really was in the wrong, but that Robert Smith, who spread the story, was indiscreet and was not in a position to know the truth when he spoke out.
