Mrs A.G. Heinrich of World’s End has received a letter from her sister Nurse Elvin Wittwer from Malaya dated 12 December 1941.  She said:

Things had taken a turn in the past few days and she wondered how long it would last.

The next day she and the other girls would be leaving the hospital to rejoin their own units, where they would be likely to stay for the duration.

There had been an air raid alarm that night, but no bombs were dropped.  [She describes what happened during air raid alerts and how they all responded.]

Everything had changed completely within a fortnight.

She speaks of many patients, dreadful mosquitoes and heavy rainfall.

Nevertheless she is well and happy and used to the weather conditions.

Their destination the next morning was unknown.
