Bread Deliveries in Burra

The Local Board of Health discussed the matter with the local baker K.F. Hall on 17 July.  The Department of Labour had advised there was no embargo on bread deliveries and authority could be granted to employ either a male or female bread carter.

The Mayor said that in asking Mr Hall to deliver bread the Council was attempting to fall in line with other Councils and get back to pre-war conditions.  The township covered an area of 22 miles [sic: meaning?  The corporation area was about 2.75 km x 4.25 km or 11.69 squ km: equivalent to about 4.3 squ miles.  Perhaps there were 22 miles of roads within the area.]

Mr Hall said he had bought the bakery when it was advertised as having no delivery or opposition.  He had since found the previous owner had stopped deliveries on his own accord not long before selling the business.  Other places were being treated in a manner similar to Burra and even with 1,500 ratepayers in a town it was found impossible to get a man to deliver bread.  If he had to deliver bread he would have to close his shop at Burra North.  It would take two days to deliver bread in the town.

The Mayor said that for 10 years there had been 5 bakers and no troubles with the deliveries of bread.  The Mayor said Mr Hall was saving £15 a week through non-delivery and charged ½d more than the delivered Adelaide price.  He could get 240 loaves from a bag of flour.  Mr Hall said he only got 100.  His Worship said grocers deliver their goods, why can’t bakers.

When Mr Wandke was in town he had told the Mayor he would have to get help or else there wouldn’t be any bread for Burra.  (There were then two bakers in the town.)  Then the other baker left and Wandke took over the vacated bakery and closed it down.  [The Mayor’s remarks as reported don’t exactly make a very coherent argument.]

Mr Hall said he had two businesses and was doing all the work at one place.  If he delivered he would have to put on another man and the National Service Officer had said there were more important jobs for men than to deliver bread.

Mayor: Girls deliver bread in the city and there are plenty of boys about.

Cr Carpenter said Council was not satisfied with the price of bread.  One good man could do the deliveries in a day.

Mr Hall said there were 600 houses in town.

Cr Carpenter said he’d do it for £6-10-0 a week.

Mr Hall said he was prepared to help old people with difficulties.  He could not work himself because of ill health.  He could not see his way clear to deliver bread at present, though he would be quite pleased if he could.
