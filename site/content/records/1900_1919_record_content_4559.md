Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting: Friday at the Institute.  It was a very tame affair and only 4 or 5 people were present at 7.30 and by 8.10 a mere 8.  A few more appeared later.  Not one candidate came forward for the vacancies that are about to occur.

Those to retire are Crs J. McLaren, C.C Williams & W.H. Hardy.

In 1901 the Council continued to asphalt footpaths and it is to be hoped this will continue.  A heavy flood early in the year damaged roads and bridges, especially in the north end of town.

For better lighting a lamp has been placed on the Commercial St Bridge in West Ward and on the Black Bridge in Redruth.  Both were much needed.

We began the year with a debit of £21-18-8 and at the last meeting there was a credit of £85-12-4.

£219-6-9 has been spent on public works.  The general rate is up from 8d to 9d, but the health rate is down from 4d to 3d.  The park lands rate will remain at 1d and the assessment for 1902 is £117-5-0 more than for last year.

A detailed financial statement follows.
