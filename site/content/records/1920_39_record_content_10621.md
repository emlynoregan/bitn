Burra Town Council, 16 April

A.S. Walker of Redruth was allowed to sub-let No. 1 Reserve Redruth, as he is leaving the town.

The overseer is recovering kerbing stone and building stone from the creek near the bowling green bridge.  It was originally the wall of what was known as Carey’s Bridge.

Local Board of Health

Nurse Goward and Mrs Fuller were granted licences for maternity homes.

Cr Hammond wanted the Council to improve drainage in Commercial St to the corner of Chapel St.

The Mayor said even if this was done the notice preventing the garages from discharging water into the street would stand.

The Town Clerk said he understood that two of the garages could make arrangements to run water into the Bank of Australasia’s underground drain.  After further discussion the matter dropped.
