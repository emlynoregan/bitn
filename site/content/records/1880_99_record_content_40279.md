Bon Accord Bridge.

The Town Council and representatives of Messrs Elder, Smith & Co. and Dempsey, Wilkinson & Sandland, with other ratepayers, inspected the Bon Accord ford on Monday afternoon.  Messrs Holder and Lake MPs were invited, but neither appeared, though Mr Holder apologised as he had to leave for Adelaide on the morning train.

A meeting at the Bon Accord Hotel followed the inspection.

Mr West, Mayor, said there was no doubt a bridge was required.  Cr Sampson agreed: floodwaters washed away metal on the ford every time it was put on.  Even when the ford was in good order water flow sometimes closed it.  A bridge was necessary and he would move that steps be taken to urge on the Government the necessity of providing one.  Cr Rabbich 2nd: when the creek was flowing teams often found it impossible to get into the town.  The bridge was also important for the stockyards which were the largest in the colony.

T. Sandland, representative of Dempsey, Wilkinson & Sandland, spoke in support and so did Cr O’Leary.

W. Fox, the representative of Elder, Smith & Co. agreed.

W.H. Hardy also supported the move - it had been advocated before and he pointed out how traffic to the east was supported by two bridges.

The whole Council was appointed a committee to draft a petition to seek the support of the District Councils of Booborowie, Hanson, Mt Bryan and Burra.
