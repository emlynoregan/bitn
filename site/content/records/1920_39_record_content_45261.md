LCL Burra Women’s Branch

Mrs I.J. Warnes introduced C.A.S. Hawker MHR as speaker.  He thanked people who helped with the recent bushfire at Canowie and spoke on the Mongolata battery.  He helped get the Commonwealth Grant for it in the middle of 1932.  He did not understand why the delay was so long.  The rest of the speech runs for about 1 column and deals with the coming state election and LCL policy.
