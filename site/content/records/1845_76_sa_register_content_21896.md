H. Nicholas of Spring Hill Farm, Salt Creek, writes re stationmen on 30 April.

[His letter reveals that the suggestion had been to replace 109 stationmen with 44 overseers.]

Stationmen look after 8-10 miles of road and many do fine work.  If some do not do their duty the solution is to replace them â€“ not to change the whole system.  The suggested savings would be illusionary.  Overseers would merely be gentlemen riding along the roads and never touching a shovel.
