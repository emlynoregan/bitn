Burra News, 23 December

Settlers on the Murray have been annoyed for some time through Aborigines being continually supplied with intoxicating drink.  Serious disturbances have occurred and often men on stations have had to stay home, neglecting their work, to protect their families and property ‘from violence by the intoxicated barbarians’.

Evidence was hard to bet and native testimony would not be given much weight.  Police-trooper [name illegible] collected evidence against 13 men by posing as a bird fancier and winning the confidence of the natives.  Five of the men who were shearers discovered the trooper’s identity and fled the district before they could be served summonses, but eight cases wear heard:

James Simmonds, wine storekeeper of North West Bend and Maria Simmonds his wife received five convictions and a fine of £6 for each plus costs £1-15-0 each to a total of £38-15-0.

Thomas Taylor, innkeeper at North West Bend received two convictions with fines of £3 and costs of £1-15-0 for each case. [£9-10-0]

H. von Reiben of Mallyon’s Hotel, River Murray received on conviction and a fine of £3 plus £1-15-0 costs.

A poor widow named Banin whose husband died last March of consumption at Kadina was last week dying of the same disease surrounded by five little children aged from 8 years to 14 months.  An amateur concert was got up for her benefit.  [The program is printed.]  £7-10-0 was collected.  Unfortunately the poor woman died just before the concert started and the money was used to aid the orphans, who will ultimately be sent to the Destitute Asylum.

[Martin Banan married Catherine Ryan 11 December 1859 at St Aloysius Church, Sevenhill.

Martin Bannin died 24 March 1868 at Wallaroo Mines aged 33.

Catherine Banin died 17 December 1868 at Kooringa aged 32.

Only three of the children seem to have birth registrations:

Margaret Banan 7 September 1863, Kooringa.

Mary Banan 25 July 1865, Kooringa.

Elizabeth Banin 7 July 1876, Kooringa.]
