James Vincent Quinn

Born Burra 1933.  Farmer and grazier of Mt Bryan and Kings Well east of Burra.  Father, Thomas and brother, Harry have both served earlier as Councillors.  From 1983087 served as representative for the Mt Bryan Ward and am currently serving the whole district and am on the Finance Committee.  Also on the Burra Robertstown Eudunda Pest Plant Control Board and was chairman for two years.  Was a school councillor while my children were at Mt Bryan and Burra schools, being both Secretary and Chairman at Mt Bryan.  Member of the Agricultural Committee at BCS for several years.  Member of Hallett Bowling Club and previously active in the Mt Bryan Tennis Club and followed the BBH Football Club through the involvement of my sons.  I believe Councillors have a duty to work towards the maintenance of the quality of life for all people of the district.
