Burra Town Council, 5 June

The Petrol Control Board has granted an extra 10 gallons for the purpose of road making.

The Highways Dept notifies that Commercial St Bridge has been rebuilt.

K.F. Hall says he will deliver bread to the elderly if they have no neighbours to assist.

Burra Electric Supply says enquiries have found no street light has been out for more than two nights after they received notification.  The Company seeks instructions concerning a light near the Oddfellows’ Hall in Burra North.

There was a sometimes humorous discussion on the dog problem and in the end the Overseer was given the power to employ a dog-catcher.
