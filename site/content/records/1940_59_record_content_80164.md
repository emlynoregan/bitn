Obituary.  Leslie S. Macgowan was today found drowned in an overhead tank about six mile north of Burra.  He had been missing since Sunday.  A member of the search party Mr R.J. Jeffery noticed a pair of shoes on top of an overhead tank on the property of Mrs M.R. Ashton and about halfway up the windmill ladder he saw a pullover and hat.  Police located the body with the aid of a length of wire.  The tank is 200 yards west of the Mt Bryan Road and two miles from the Macgowan home.  The tank is covered and the body was recovered through the two foot square opening only with some difficulty.  The tank is about six and a half feet off the ground.  The deceased was last seen by his wife at about 3.45 p.m. on Sunday.  Mr Macgowan was a World War I veteran and was born in Burra.  He was aged 66 and had not enjoyed the best of health for some months.  He is survived by his wife and two sons aged 11 and sixteen.  [Leslie Sampson MacGowan born 14 February 1891 Redruth: died 19 January 1958 near Burra North.]
