Arbor Day.  A very large audience attended the Arbor Day Concert organised by Mr Wittber for last Friday.  It is reviewed item by item.

[Two of F.W. Holderâ€™s children performed: Ethel (11) gave a recitation in German and Rhoda (10) recited The Wreck of the Orpheus.]

Arbor Day will be held next Wednesday week.
