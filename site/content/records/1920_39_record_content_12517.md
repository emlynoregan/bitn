Characteristics of the 1923 paper.

Page 1

Large advertisements, mostly local

Page 2

Smaller advertisements and public notices.  Particularly auction sales and local events and Local Government matters.  Just occasionally some news begins on this page.

Page 3

Page 2 material sometimes spills over onto this page.  Mainly advertisements and local news.

Page 4

A mixture of advertisements sometimes with news, but also often with non-news articles of interest.

In the last quarter of the year especially the amount of advertising led to a considerable number of supplements of varying size.

The paper still generally provided quite a comprehensive record of events, but there is little editorial comment and an uneven attention to detail.  Often great detail is provided for sports and for some other events too, but there is little suggestion of real journalism.
