Last year’s Public Exam results were very good, with Burra HS scholars getting 54 passes from 66 subjects taken.  Six of nine candidates gained their certificates.  Carliene Davies earned nine subjects and three credits and gained an Intermediate Exhibition; the first one to Burra for 17 years.

Innovations in 1948:

Mr Deer and the 1st Year class built a school garden, which was looking very good until about a week ago, when sheep broke in and ate most of it.  We will try again next year.

Dancing classes have been held by Mr Burdon and proved very popular.  The results were seen at the High School Ball, when scholars were able to lead the polonaise successfully.

Softball was successfully introduced as a winter game for those girls who could not get into the basketball teams.

A short session each morning on topical events was introduced to encourage interest in what is happening around us.

The annual excursion away was reluctantly cancelled because of the shorter academic year.

The school has been able to offer a good range of courses, with both General and Commercial courses available and with four Technical Subjects.

Sporting activities have been a regular feature.  Draysey House won the weekly house match contests.  Burra gained only the ‘wooden spoon’ at the Mid-North High Schools Sports Day at Balaklava, largely due to the youthfulness of our students compared with the other schools.

The school’s own Sports Day was held at the Racecourse, with individual cups going to: Senior, Brian Bell and Joan Nelson; Junior, Dean Bernhardt and Lindley Davies.  During the year we visited Clare once and they returned the visit.
