‘Hanson’ writes that on 18 September he was surprised to see a man ‘or overgrown boy’ pass through a fence enclosing a road on both sides of which there was a standing crop of wheat.  There was a mob of sheep nearby, but the person did not put up the fence or do anything to protect the crop.  He knows there should have been a gate there, but had thought neither man nor boy would be so mean as to destroy a man’s crop, especially when the man was a returned soldier.
