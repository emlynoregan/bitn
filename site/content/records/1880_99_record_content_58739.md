Weather.  Last Friday there was a severe thunderstorm in Burra, but it was much heavier in Kooringa than at Redruth.  The downpour lasted 20 minutes and caused all the creeks to run.  The arch bridge near Mr C. Grow’s stables in Ayer St [Deadman’s Bridge] overflowed for the first time in 30 years.  A nearby footbridge was washed away.  The main creek ran for an hour or two and was cleaned out.  At the cemetery the creek near the front gate overflowed and the flow entered the front gate and down to the back gate, creating considerable extra work for the curator.  Residents on Mitchell Flat were almost washed out and two cows feeding in a gully were carried 300 yards before struggling out of the flow.  The Kooringa Post Office recorded 67 points, but it is believed up to three times that fell in some parts.  At Redruth there was only a sharp shower.  The storm path passed to the east where the Deep Creek ford was washed away.  All other fords in the area were damaged except the Baldina Creek ford.  At Mongolata 2” fell and it is estimated that over 5” fell at King’s Well.
