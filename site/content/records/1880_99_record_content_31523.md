W.T. Rabbich writs at length [⅔ column] taking issue with Dungey’s assertions that men’s industrial efforts have been universally restricted.  He considers that all things considered the colony is in a flourishing state and has achieved great things.  He argues the common sense of borrowing leading to development of a stronger economy.
