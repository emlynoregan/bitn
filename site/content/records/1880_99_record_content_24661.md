Obituary & Inquest.  An inquest was held on 11 February at the Terowie Institute on the body of Edward Sydney Carlton Grey, with E. Stephens as coroner and E.F. Brady as foreman of the jury.  [Death registered as Gray, 10 February, aged 20.]

William Mardon, railway clerk, who had shared a room with the deceased at Opie’s Hotel Terowie, described returning to the room about 6 p.m. when finding the door locked and believing he had heard a shot he had gone around to the window and looking in saw the deceased dead, apparently shot.

Joseph Reed Opie, proprietor of the hotel had known the deceased for two years.  When informed by Mardon he had gone to the window, seen the deceased and then went to get the police.  He did not see the gun, but there were no signs of a struggle.

On questioning he said he had received a letter from the deceased after the event, of a private nature in which he said there was a position for him at Broken Hill.

Dr Otto L.M. Abramowsky described the body and said the deceased had taken chlorodyne and appeared to have been quietly awaiting death when disturbed by the return of Mardon who knocked on the door.  He then shot himself.  Death would have been instantaneous.

Henry Charles Sims, builder of Terowie, and M-C Peter Phillip Brown gave evidence that added little to the account.

A letter addressed ‘To Whom it May Concern’ and dated 1 February was read which said he was taking his life because he was tired of it and had committed a wrong and would sooner die than go to gaol.  He asks that his people and brother at Broken Hill be notified and that the rings on his little finger be sent to Miss Kate ____ of Adelaide.

The jury decided he came to his death by his own act while suffering under a state of despondency.
