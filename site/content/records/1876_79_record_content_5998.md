Editorial on the Burra Cemetery. This needs to be enlarged. Repairs are needed. Money is a problem as although the cemetery is in theory £250 in credit, the Council has borrowed this for other purposes. Not only is money short, but the Govt. has retained over £70 of the expected subsidy to pay for the police. The ratepayers have authorised the borrowing of £400 and it should be done, to be repaid at say £100 in 1881 and £100 in each of the next three years.

Mr Rees. We object to the tone of Mr Rees's speech at the dinner to Mr Bath. Instead of addressing the complimentary business of the evening he determined on introducing a great deal of political matter into his speech. He clearly regrets greatly his loss of office. He thinks we have forgotten he lost office through changing parties. We haven't.
