Eastern Districts Fire Fighting Association’s Annual Meeting was held at the showgrounds on Wednesday last.  A.D. Radford was elected Chairman.  Messrs Rex & Les Warnes were elected Deputy Supervisors.  The Chairman’s report said the year had not presented much of a fire hazard, but this year’s better season could see this situation reversed in the coming months.  Three properties have changed hands: Bazantin, Neds & Nolans and had been absorbed by Association members.  At the end of the meeting there was a demonstration of radio communications.
