Mr [Guy] Dollman sued Mrs Meers for £65-6-4 for materials and labour on a car.  Mrs Meers counter-sued for faulty workmanship.

At the end of March 1929 he and his then employee Mr Winkley had discussed the work to be done on an Overland car and Mr Winkley said it would cost about £35 for labour.  Mr Meers gave the go ahead.  They were waiting for an oil pump when Meers insisted on taking the car and they patched up the old pump, but warned Meers they could not guarantee the job without the new pump.  The old pump failed twice in a period of a couple of weeks.  More work was done in July and he wanted then a new camshaft.  They asked for part payment of the account rendered – then £50 odd.  The plaintiff had received no money by the end of July.

Henry Winkley gave evidence detailing the damage to the car and gave an exhaustive account of the work done on it.  He corroborated the plaintiff’s statements.

Barney Hilton Rogers also had worked for Dollman at the time and also corroborated the evidence of Dollman & Winkley.

Thomas Warhurst of North Adelaide gave expert witness evidence as an employee of Overland’s Ltd.

The defendant’s counter-claim was dismissed, but the defence of excessive charges was upheld and the verdict for the plaintiff was for £51.
