Kooringa News, 24 July

On Wednesday 17 July a meeting was held at the Burra Hotel on the subject of immigration.  About 400 workingmen and tradesmen had assembled by 8 p.m.  Mr H. Corey was voted into the chair.  J. Jenkins spoke against resuming immigration at the present time with sufficient labour in the colony and nothing in prospect to justify more immigration.  He moved a motion in line with this view.  Mr Baker seconded and spoke about the prevailing unemployment.  Mr Moody supported the motion at some length.  Mr Vivian’s motion to prepare a memorial against resuming immigration and the collection of signatures for the same was carried without dissension.  A motion by Mr Smith and Mr Dennis setting up a committee to implement this was also passed.

The meeting then went on to discuss the conduct of Mr Justice Boothby in reference to several decisions in the Supreme Court.  Several censured His Honour’s antagonism to the Real Property Act as well as his general conduct.  It was resolved to petition the House of Assembly on this subject.

On Tuesday 23 July a public meeting at the Burra Hotel was held to consider the state of the town with a view to improving the state of the streets.  Attendance was poor and it was therefore decided to consider it a preliminary meeting.  It was resolved to form a committee to communicate with the Mining Company and the Smelting Company and the Central Road Board and to report back to a further general meeting.  The committee comprised Messrs Drew, Dawson, Pearce, Winnall, Challoner, Killicoat, Bath, Wilkinson (National Bank), Anderson (Australasian Bank) and Dr Mayne.

The road between Kooringa and Adelaide are appalling.  There is a paucity of travellers and this with the holes and quagmires has resulted in the mail cart running only two or three days a week, with the mail carried on horseback on other days.
