ETSA is cutting its country employees from 320 to 260.  Thirteen works depots around SA will close.  Burra is one of two places that will lose all ETSA presence in the town.  In future trucks and workers will have to come from Clare for maintenance or emergencies.  The move aims to increase efficiency without loss of service according to a spokesperson.  Burra had eight full-time positions five years ago and two at present.  ETSA has been under pressure from interstate suppliers and electricity charges have declined significantly in recent years said Rob Kerin MP.
