Weather.  The cold dry conditions continue.  In the past two weeks the frosts have continued to decimate gardens and cause significant household damage due to burst pipes.  Monday temperatures down to -8ÂºC have been reported.  The edges of the Burra Creek have frozen and massive leaf fall has occurred from white cedars.
