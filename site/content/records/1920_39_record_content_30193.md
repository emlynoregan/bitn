Boy Scouts.  The first parade with uniforms was on 27 March.  On Saturday a very full day of outdoor scouting activities was held at Baldina Creek on the property of Mr John Barker.  The scouts took over the Scout Hall from 1 April thanks to Mr James Reed.  The cost will be the interest on the capital which amounts to x. Â£14 p.a.  A syndicate of supporters has paid the first six months interest.
