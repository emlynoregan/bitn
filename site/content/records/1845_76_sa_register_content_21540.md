Kooringa News, 7 January

Rev. L.W. Stanton preached two impressive New Year sermons on Sunday, 5 January.

Fire.  Last Thursday there was a fire at Booborowie, believed to be the work of incendiaries.  Another on Friday between Mr Gebhardt’s Run and Mr Hallett’s was caused by a shepherd throwing out ashes.  A third on Saturday between Booborowie and Gum Creek is believed to have been deliberately lit.  The Bush Fire Act needs to be amended to cover fires caused by carelessness.  At present only fires lit on purpose are covered.

An earthquake was felt at 3 p.m. yesterday and reports have also come in from Mt Bryan and World’s End.  Pictures shook and plates rattled.

Weather.  There is a gentle shower of rain tonight with indications of its continuing for some hours.
