Anniversary of the War

This was held on 10 August; again in perfect weather.  Large crowds gathered in Market Square and the town was extensively decorated.  The usual sort of procession led by the Ladies’ band took place with a Queen competition, stalls, Cheap Jack etc.  Colonel S. Price Weir DSO addressed the gathering.  The auction of a gold button under the Bugler system realised £273-14-0.  The Institute was crowded for a magnificent film show at night and in all the total proceeds were c. £1,438.
