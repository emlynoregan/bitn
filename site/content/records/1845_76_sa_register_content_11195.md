‘Go-Ahead’ writes re the Northern Mails.

The mails now take two days each way.  I think this can be reduced in either one of two ways.

The mail leaves Adelaide by the 7.15 train and departs Gawler at 8.45 and reached Kooringa at 7 o’clock.

Depart Adelaide by the 3.45 train and depart Gawler the following morning at 6 a.m., arriving at Kooringa about 5 o’clock.

Any better plan would be welcome, but some change is needed, as at present four and sometimes five days must elapse before an answer can be received to a letter despatched from here.  Steps should be taken now, as the tenders for the conveyance of the mails will soon be out.
