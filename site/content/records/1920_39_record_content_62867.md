Burra Bowling Club held its AGM at the Burra Hotel last Tuesday evening with a fair attendance.  Financially the position is a little worse than twelve months ago.  The overdraft has been reduced a little, but we have spent more than half the £29 received from the sale of property.  Subscriptions raised £80-9-0 compared with £81-5-0 last year.  We have lost eight members during the year and gained six, plus four new night members.  The Croquet Club contributed £21-1-0 compared with £32-15-0 the previous year.  Inter-club matches saw us lose the cup to Kapunda after having it for two years and we failed to win the Shield from Clare.  In summary, of thirteen matches, we won five, lost seven and drew one.  We were third in the Pennant Competition.

Elected: Patron, Dr D.M. Steele; President, S.H. Robinson; Vice-Presidents, H. Mumme & Max Pearce and Secretary/Treasurer, J.T. Pascoe.  [Details in c. 1 column.]
