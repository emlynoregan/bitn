Burra Hospital Board, Thursday.

The Chairmen reported considerable success in collecting money owed.

Mr Warnes moved and Mr Lane 2nd a move to charge anything from 2/6 to £3-3-0 a week depending on the ability to pay.  At present they were charging either 25/- or nothing.  Mr Winnall was vigorously opposed.  If he went into a general ward he would expect to pay for that.  If he went into a hotel he paid 1/- for a 1/- dinner no matter what his income.  Mr Gebhardt also thought the idea ridiculous and Mr Hawkes could not imagine the board doing such inquisitorial work.  Mr Crewes thought the motion a step in the right direction.  Mr Winnall said if he travelled by rail he had the right to travel 2nd class and pay a 2nd class fare and it should be the same in hospital.  The Chairman, A.J. McBride, thought they could increase the ward fees and allow the House Committee to reduce them where necessary.  Mr McLaren sided with Winnall etc.

The motion was lost 6 to 5.

Sister Wood has resigned.

The Chief Secretary writes that the Department cannot at present provide a scullery and cellar.  The Superintendent of Public Buildings reports the isolation ward is a disgrace to the Board.

Mr Warnes said the Superintendent only glanced at it.

The Chief Secretary advises that Mr P.A. McBride has been appointed to the Board.

Mr McLaren found himself unable to congratulate the appointee.  It was an insult so young a man should be appointed and ‘further one whose father was the chairman and who had two uncles and a father-in-law on the Board’ – it was a discredit to many eligible people.  [P.A.  McBride was then 24.  His father was A.J. McBride, his uncles were W.G. Hawkes and S.M. Lane and E.W. Crewes was his father-in-law.]

He moved the Board respectfully protest against the appointment of Mr P.A. McBride.  Mr Warnes regretfully 2nd saying ‘it looked as though there would be a block vote on occasions.  The appointment looked as though undue influence had been used.’

Mr Crewes denied any prior knowledge of the appointment.  He could not see that the relationship would make any difference – he had a mind of his own.

Mr Hawkes disapproved also and concluded that the board was being made ‘a training ground for public office’. 

‘He had no doubt that influence, and most improper influence had been at work.  He did not impute the influence to members of the Board.  As a member of the family he wished to repudiate any connection with so undesirable an appointment.’
