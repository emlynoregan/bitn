Guy Fawkes Night was celebrated on 5 November with large and small fires everywhere.  An accident in the afternoon rather spoiled the fun for one group of enthusiasts for a while when, on turning Henderson’s corner, their makeshift carriage carrying Guy disintegrated and he lost not only his stuffing, but his hat and mask.  Repairs took an hour or so before he was again ready to be consigned to the flames.
