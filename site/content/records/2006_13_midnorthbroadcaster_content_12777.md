Burra Men’s Shed has been attracting increased numbers and so will open for an extra day each week.  When it began over two years ago five or six men formed the group.  They were fortunate to be given the use of the Burra North Shed by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources.  Now with 20 men attending it was decided to open on Thursdays as well as Wednesdays.
