Booborowie, 18 June.

The weather has been almost continually wet.  The plains, for a want of proper channels to guide away the excess water, are in a shocking state.  The eating house can be described as a lighthouse in the dark.

From Baldry Post Office to Gum Creek Paddock horses could propel a load better in a boat than in a wagon.

Wool in the drier parts of SA will be ‘breachy’ this year.  Rain following locusts and a dry period will result in a weak section in the middle, which will break in manufacture.  Wool in this area is excellent.
