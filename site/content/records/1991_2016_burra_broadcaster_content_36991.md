Letter.  David Wilkins of Sydney writes congratulating the Burra History Group on the usefulness of their website with respect to family history research.

‘I have utilised many historical websites in my family history travels, but I don’t think I have found a better one than the Burra site…It has a wealth of data and information, it is well laid out, has interesting and comparative photographs of the old and new and is a successful means of obtaining assistance from your historians.  It is a credit to all involved and I congratulate you.’
