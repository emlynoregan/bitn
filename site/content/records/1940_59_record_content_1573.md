Obituary.  Charles Grow died at Burra hospital this morning.  He had been born in Kooringa on 25 June 1858 in a dugout on the banks of Burra Creek.  He was unmarried and spent all his life in Burra.

[SA Births CD suggests he was born 21 January 1869 at Kooringa, but the claim that he was 81 at death is consistent with the 1858 date.  If so then we have identified the wrong parents!  Death is registered as 6 May 1940.]
