Burra Humid Crib.  Following the death of a baby despite the use of the humid crib, allegations have circulated that poor power supply from the Burra Electric Supply Co. was to blame.  R.H. Campbell, secretary for the company, writes to say that on other occasions it has been possible to boost supply for particular purposes – though with caution due to the potential to damage the equipment of other users.  On this occasion the company was not made aware of the emergency.  Secondly the delay in obtaining operating temperature from 1½ to 6 hours could have been overcome with a few minutes work changing the bulbs that supply the heat.
