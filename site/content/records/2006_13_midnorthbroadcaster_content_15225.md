Ruth Norris, Burra’s resident Animal Rescue and Care Officer, has been short listed as a finalist in the 2012 Pride of Australia Awards for untiring and selfless environment work in the community.  She is well known in the community as the person to call when finding a sick or injured animal.  It is not unusual for her to receive up to five calls a day regarding animals.  She is supported by her children and husband Stuart.  She attends call outs for kangaroos, eagles, hawks, owls, echidnas, lizards and more.  She assesses the animals, checks for pouch young and drives them to a vet if she thinks they can be saved or they are mercifully euthanased.   Some are released into the wild after rehabilitation.  In 2006 Ruth was headhunted by the RSPCA to become an Honorary Inspector for the Mid North.  Due to the demand for services the couple have spent more than $10,000 of their own money on caging facilities.  After 4½ years the RSPCA decided to abolish the honorary positions due to legislation.  Ruth and Stuart have continued the service and began their own Animal Rescue & Care Incorporated Association from November 2011.  This involves liaison with SES, police, CFS, Regional Councils, the Department of Environment & Natural Resources, local vets, etc. to ensure the best outcomes for animals.  Ruth became an International Horse Riding Instructor in the 1980s and studied Animal Attending at Gilles Plains TAFE in 2004, where she was the Student of the Year.  She is also a qualified Equine, Small Animal and Human Bowen Therapist.  She is currently studying a BSc full time at the University of New England, majoring in Zoology.  Ruth’s nomination was submitted by Stuart with support from Goyder Council, Burra Police, DENR, Clare Animal Health and Clare Veterinary Clinic.  The winners will be selected at a Pride of Australia Ceremony to be held in Adelaide in September.
