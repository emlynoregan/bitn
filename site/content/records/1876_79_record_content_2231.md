Eastern Road: Midland Road board received a direction from Commissioner of Public Works directing them to construct the road from Kooringa to NW Bend as provided in the Act and not the deviation via Aberdeen.

[The quibble then became one over the word versus the spirit of the Act with the Board believing they fulfilled the spirit. There was also debate over whether there really was a difference between Aberdeen and Kooringa as few people outside those towns knew them as separate and thought of the place as Burra.]

The board decided not to respond immediately, but to seek further legal advice as the instruction seemed based on a technicality. They were inclined to stick to their position - after all why have a Board if the minister could issue orders overturning the decisions based on actual inspection and on the spot surveys.
