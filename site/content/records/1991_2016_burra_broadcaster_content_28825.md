Letter.  Doug Wiltshire writes at length on the sale of O’Connor’s Shed [Drew & Crewe’s Bulk Store]:

It was originally offered for sale as seven allotments.

The cost of restoration and loss of expensive flooring is another story.

Little income has been derived by Council from the asset.

Offers from $75,000 were made.

Some Councillors had concerns re access to the sale yards.

5 allotments were then withdrawn.

The remainder were offered for sale.

He believes at least on offer for $50,000 was made – which was the asking price.

On 20 June 2000 Mr McBride was allowed to use the site to wash down his trucks.  (Previously done at my front gate.)

This would seem to contravene EPA requirements that the washing down area be paved and water run-off be collected in a pit, from which waste can be recovered.  This is still not being done.

Negotiations began with Mr McBride in January 2001 and remained confidential to April 2002.

A minute on 15 May 2001 said Councillors agreed the land was to go to public consultation as the first step to exclude it as Community Land – never done due to the obsession of Council to maintain confidentiality.

This is contrary to Council policy.

Council seems to have taken advantage of a loop-hole re consultation, by claiming it does not come under the new LGA Act (1999), because it was offered for sale prior to this Act.

In February 2002 Council voted to accept an offer from A. McBride for the exchange of six vacant allotments in Cooper and Taylor Streets and to subdivide off three hectares of land next to the cemetery, to enable expansion of the cemetery and Council has confirmed it is paying for all subdivision and survey costs.

If the cemetery area was a bargaining chip, then one must ask why the Council did not use compulsory acquisition powers to obtain that.

Mr McBride has been able to use the O’Connor’s site rent free in the interim.

The final agreement involves no cash adjustment, but the McBride land has been valued at only $15,000 and the O’Connor’s Shed and land at $75,000 some years ago – involving the Council in a loss of $60,000.

Why wasn’t the property simply auctioned as it should have been?

On 25 March 2002 permission was given for Mr McBride to erect a residence on the truck depot site, but this was a non-complying land use and so public consultation should have occurred.

I have been assured that all appropriate fees for this development have been paid, but such fees do not appear in the register and Council says it did not consider the development o be non-complying.

My experience has been very different.

Council provided ballast from the railway station and spread it at the truck depot at no cost.

Council denies sealing 700 m of road in front of Mr McBride’s house as part of the deal.

This work was not included in the published works program of 2002-03.

Mr Wiltshire says he takes no issue with McBride’s, other than to inform and illustrate the facts of the case to ratepayers, who have a right to know.  He makes no inference of wrong-doing by them, but he does take issue with all Councillors and Council administration however, whom he feels owe ratepayers an explanation.
