Advt.  Lancelot Woolwash of Anderson & Dick & Co., late of Pt Augusta.

Buying Wool & Skins for highest Market Value.

Wool Buyers and Scourers, Railway Station, Dawson Road LANCELOT.

[This needs some research, as I cannot find that Lancelot had a station (or even a railway line).  The nearest station seems to be Ucolta, which would have a Dawson Road, and may be where the business was located.]
