Mr R. Sexton was given a farewell from the RSL on Thursday afternoon.  Mr Sexton is on six months furlough (on account of ill health), but does not expect to return to Burra in his business capacity.  He left by the East-West Express for WA on Friday.  Mr Sexton had done much for the RSL members and was outstanding in his effort on behalf of the ex-servicemen, their dependants and orphans.  He has been President of the sub-branch and more recently Treasurer.
