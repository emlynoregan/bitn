Burra Cheer-up Society.  The Ladies’ Band went to Adelaide on 27 October to take part in Commercial Travellers’ Day in aid of Army Nurses.  They were met and entertained for breakfast at the Cheer-up Hut.  The Mayor thanked Mrs Seager and assistants for their work and after 11 o’clock they were welcomed to the Commercial Travellers’ club.  They then dispersed till 1.30 p.m. when they played a selection in front of the Cheer-up Hut and then marched to Adelaide Oval to assist in the program there.  A street march was cancelled on account of the wet weather.  The band had the honour of leading a parade of returned heroes and boys in camp around the oval and then played at various times in the afternoon.  On Thursday a welcome home social was given Pte Cyril Collins and Sister Hatherly was farewelled for the front.  Lt J. Statton’s photo has been received.  Pte H. Miller was welcomed by telegram on his arrival in Adelaide.
