Booborowie, 15 December.

The weather has been boisterous and this has delayed reaping.  Locusts and high winds have knocked much grain out of the heads, especially near the edges of fields.  Nevertheless, the prospects overall are for a fair average yield.

The rate of wages is as high as 30/- a week plus board and lodging, for able-bodied men.

[The correspondent complains that not one penny of the £2,349 supplied to the North Midland Road Board for maintenance of main roads is to be spent on the Farrell’s Flat-Booborowie-Stone Hut road, even though it is the main feeder to the Farrell’s Flat Railway Station, which has more wheat traffic than any other station.]

Kooringa, 15 December.

Changeable weather has halted reaping.

John Roach has built a spacious wheat store next to his mill.

Hacket Coulthurst, the Negro elocutionist, gave two entertainments in the Institute Hall on Friday and Saturday evenings.  Audiences were scanty, but he gave zealous performances.
