Accident.  On Saturday morning at the Burra Burra Mine a whole mass of rubbish fell on a young lad by the name of Vallick, who was employed screening underground.  A nearby miner was nearly blinded by the dust.  The youth’s body was recovered quickly, but life was extinct.  W. Lang Esq. held an inquest on Saturday at 3 o’clock.  The jury viewed the body, of which the back of the head was completely smashed and the right leg broken.  Evidence was given that the fall was entirely unexpected and the timbering in the area was done with caution and carefulness.  A verdict of accidental death was recorded.  Deceased was the son of a miner and his poor mother is far advanced in pregnancy.  [No one of this name appears in the records of SA Births, Marriages or Deaths.  Neither are there likely candidates for the death under other similar names, but on Saturday 12 May 1849 the death is recorded of James Villis (aged 16) in the right district.  There is, however, no record of a Mrs Villis fitting the description of ‘far advanced in pregnancy’.  Elizabeth and Henry Villis had a son they named James on 24 December 1849.  This might fit as a replacement ‘James’ if the interpretation of ‘far advanced’ is rather loose, but this is all speculation.]
