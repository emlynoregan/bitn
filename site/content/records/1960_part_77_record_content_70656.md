Burra Burra DC

The Local

Government Association is seeking Council feedback on a proposal for quarterly payment of rates.  At present inly about 16% of rates are paid on issue of rates notices.  The rest are not paid till the end of February.  Council has to pay interest on its overdraft and this cost id considerably higher than the accounting cost of quarterly payments.

Spraypave Pty Ltd is sealing the Station Road and the parking area, but has been delayed by bad weather.

Approximately $2,500 has been transferred from the 1st Copper Festival to the Tourist Committee.

Through the generosity of Mrs Andrew Tennant a town clock with two faces has been erected in the lawn area in Commercial St.  [Market Square.]

The stray dog problem in the town has not improved.

Vandals have damaged the toilets at the Council Office, allowing water to run freely overnight on 6 April.

At Burra North cisterns were tampered with and water allowed to run to such an extent that a section of wall has sagged.

Burra’s evidence to the Local Government Boundaries Royal Commission will be taken on Friday.  The submission by the Council was formulated in July 1973 and the Council opposes the formation of Regional Councils on the basis that:

It will mean added costs to ratepayers.

Such a council would carry out the same duties that the present Council does.

There would be unnecessary duplication of work and administrative costs.
