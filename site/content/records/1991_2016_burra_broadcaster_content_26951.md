Christmas in Burra

Businesses are backing the Christmas children’s trail and Santa’s Cave next to the Post Office.

There will be no pageant this year, but it is planned to re-introduce one in 2002.

Jo Gebhardt said the cake auction was very successful.

Paula Illicevs writes urging the restoration of the Christmas pageant and lights for 2002.
