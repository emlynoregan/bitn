Mt Bryan Auxiliary members presented a cheque for $200 to the Burra Hospital to be used for the recently introduced diversional therapy program.  The idea is to operate theme days, crafts, gardening, aromatherapy, music and cooking.  The cheque will be used for the purchase of large print games, cards and bingo, plus a set of skittles and balls.
