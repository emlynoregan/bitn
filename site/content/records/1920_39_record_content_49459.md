Mongolata Goldfield

America has gone off the gold standard and the price of gold has risen.

Byles’ GM has declared a dividend of 6d a share.  They are crushing about 130 tons at the Mongolata battery.  For the fortnight ending 26 January work proceeded on a drive at the 200ft level and on a winze and a rise.  At the 52ft level work continued on a drive in low grade ore.

Golden Harp.  The north drive advanced to 26ft on a lode 2’6” wide giving a pan test of 1oz per ton.  12 tons at grass.  They were erecting an aerial line from the dump to carry ore to the bottom of the range.  130 tons is at Byles’ ready to crush.

Several claims on exemptions for some time are being worked again and quite a number of claims are putting down main shafts indicating confidence in the field.

Poem by C.H. Souter on Burra Mine: The Green Pool.
