Mr Warnes brought up the idea of assessing patients’ ability to pay again.  The others wanted to reduce charges when people couldn’t pay.

Mr Hawkes then suggested:	Ward Patients 5/- a day, (£1-15-0 a week).

Private Rooms 10/- a day, (£3-10-0 a week).

Special nurses to be extra, but medicine & bandages included.  Carried.
