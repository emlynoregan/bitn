Victoria

A meeting in Melbourne on 9 June set up a subscription list to establish a reward for the discoverer of gold in the Port Phillip Bay District – within 200 miles of Melbourne.

Also to discuss the possibility of Government rewards, perhaps in the form of land grants.

On 17 June the Melbourne Times announced that Mr Welsh, a watchmaker, had discovered gold in the Plenty District on 12 June, in quartz veins varying from 1 inch to 18 inches in width.  It was in the form of gold dust, to be recovered from the slate by grinding it to powder and then washing it.  Tests verified it was gold when Mr Welsh and Henry Frenchman submitted it to analysis.

The Governor has been petitioned to offer a reward for the discovery of gold.

On 16 June Mr Thomas Clarke, a solicitor, received from a friend a fine specimen of gold found in the Pyrenees.  Also Mr Reay Clarke of Kilmore discovered gold in the King Parrot Creek.
