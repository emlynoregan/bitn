Thieves forced their way in to Mr G.H. Dollman’s Burra Motor Co. on Friday night and stole the safe and contents.  They also entered the Burra hotel and stole cigarettes and £14 cash.  They apparently escaped in a Holden car stolen from Kapunda.  The stolen safe contained £80 in notes plus some cheques and legal documents.  Petrol was stolen from a bowser at Clare on Saturday morning.
