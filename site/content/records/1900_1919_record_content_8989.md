The Day Affair.

On Monday we received a letter saying an almost destitute girl was induced to leave home to work for Mrs Day for 2/- a week and clothes.  She went to the house in Kingston St near Henderson’s Bridge and began her duties.  After a day or two she was sent away after a row.  The husband then arranged for her to return.  Kerosene was put on her head and her hair cut off and later she left.

We then interviewed the girl, Emmie Smith.

She confirmed going to the Days for 2/- a week and found in clothes.  She was to do the household duties while Mrs Day went out visiting – also the lion’s share of the washing.  While she was there her hair was cut off by Mary [Day] and kerosene put on her head.  She was told it would make her hair grow strong and nice.  When she left on Saturday she was told to leave the clothes behind for the next girl.  ‘All my underclothing was taken from me, and I am no better off now than when I went there; in fact I am worse off; I have lost my hair; and have been made an “object for people to look at”.’

We have seen the jagged hair and it is certainly a poor job.  Enquiries are being made into the case to see what can be done in the matter.  The girl should have the clothes returned to her, which to keep from her is against decency and humanity.

[This and the article in the following issue resulted in the Days suing the publisher for libel: see Burra Record: 614, 24 Feb. 1904, pages 2-3.]
