Mt Bryan CWA room was opened on 28 August.

[This report is light on details of the room, even though about 1 column is devoted to the activities of the day.  It is described as a ‘new room’ but donations were taken to renovate a fireplace.  It would seem safe to infer that it was a renovated room in the Mt Bryan Hall.]
