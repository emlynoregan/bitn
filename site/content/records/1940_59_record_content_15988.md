FFCF Unit 109 held its 4th AGM.  President Mrs A. Tennant reported the year’s activities.

Parcels went to headquarters every month, though rather less than last year’s.  The main money-raising effort was direct giving in March and April with a dance on 9 April.  The appeal raised over £450 of which our share £152-2-11.  [Presumably this means the rest came from other FFCF Units in the district.]  The Christmas Hamper Appeal raised money for 207 hampers.

The FFCF & Red Cross Shop is the unit’s steady source of funds.

Our unit sent 39 parcels to Burra men in the Forces as well as a parcel to each man on departure.

We thank Mrs Butler who has been treasurer for four years, but is not offering to stand again.  Elected were President, Mrs A. Tennant and Vice-Presidents, Mesdames J. Barker & O. Finch.  The secretary’s and treasurer’s positions remain to be filled at the next meeting.
