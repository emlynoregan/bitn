Evan Hawke recently reported to the Goyder Animal & Plant Board an outbreak of Khaki Weed adjacent to the boundary of the truck parking bay a Burra North by the saleyards.  This is only the third reporting of the weed in the Boardâ€™s area and just the second in the township.  It is a prostrate perennial that produces obnoxious burrs and is a threat to park, ovals and lawns, etc.
