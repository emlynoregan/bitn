Aberdeen Football Club held its annual wind-up meeting in Jubilee Hall on 18 January.  Speeches were interspersed with items.  This year the club was successful in winning the premiership, the Association Shield and the Gallagher Trophy.  During the year the Association adopted the rules and method of deciding the premiership from the Yorke’s Peninsula Association.  Norman Fuss won the medal for most brilliant and consistent player.  Financially things are not so good: expenses exceeded income by £3-11-6 – due mainly to the payment of travelling expenses to players.

During the year the Chairman Mr Charles Fuss died and his sound advice to players will be sadly missed.

Also a scoreboard was erected at Aberdeen.

A benefit match raised £10-9-0 for the Sedgman family and £4-1-1 went to the Ambulance Fund.

The Temby medal was presented.

The President Mr Gallagher was presented with a photograph as a memento – single bust photos of members of the winning team 5” x 4” and off officials.

W.J. McDonald as Chairman of the Association then presented the Captain Francis Bernhardt with the Gallagher Trophy.
