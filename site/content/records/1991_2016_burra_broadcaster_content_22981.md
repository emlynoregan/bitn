Burra’s Traders have been on the move in the past two or three months.  Clodes closed their shop, the Newsagency and the Mobil Roadhouse changed hands.  Day’s Meats closed and Greenslade’s ‘Gaslight Collectables’ has opened.  The Market Square snack bar has changed hands within the same family.  Oppie’s is trading under a new banner.  Mongolata Gold is moving across the street and a new hardware store will shortly open in Commercial St.
