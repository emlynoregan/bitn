Fire.  The fourth fire in two months occurred on Koonoona on Saturday at about 6.45 p.m. in a gully off the Old Koonoona Road, north of the homestead.  Fire fighters attended from Burra, Booborowie, Hallett, Mt Bryan, Clare, Hanson, Manoora, Robertstown and Saddleworth.  It was very difficult in the windy conditions to burn breaks, but the blaze was finally halted at 10.30 p.m.  1,250 acres of paster were lost, with much fencing, telephone poles and 15 sheep.  Mr S.J. Woollacott, an adjoining landowner, also lost 60-100 acres of pasture and half a mile of fencing.  It seems strange that of five fires this season four have been on Koonoona Proprietorsâ€™ property: four at Koonoona and one on their Booborowie property.  Altogether they have lost about 2,500 acres of rich pastures.
