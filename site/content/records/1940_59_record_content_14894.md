Booborowie Centenary [Continued from 63, 33, 24 Aug. 1943, page 4.]

Apparently the erection of a school at Baldry had been considered, but at a meeting of Council on 2 August 1879 residents asked that the school be placed on Section 495 Hd of Hanson, as it was more central.  This site was chosen when Leighton School was built.

4 February 1882 James Loudon was elected to Council.

1881 was a lean year.

5 August 1882 Council bought a road roller for £42.

Star thistles were of concern and in 1886 local Members of Parliament were advised some form of compulsion on their removal was needed.

In 1887 The Council supported the payment of MPs.

In 1887 the DC of Mt Bryan tried to amalgamate with Hallett and the Hundreds of Ayers & Anne.  Booborowie DC Chairman at a meeting on 3 September 1887 opposed the move and instead managed to get the Hundred of Anne placed under the Booborowie DC and on 4 February 1888 the dept. of Lands requested that three Councillors be appointed for Anne Ward.

The District Clerk got an additional £30 for looking after Anne Ward and an additional £50 for services as an Inspector of Vermin and an Overseer.

Messrs W.A. Murray & James Craig became the first Councillors for Anne Ward on 24 March 1888.  The Council Chambers were not centrally located and in 1888 it was decided to build new ones north of the Booborowie Eating House.  Tenders were called and Sara & Dunstan’s tender was accepted on 4 August 1888 for £131-4-0.

A petition asked for the mail to be made twice weekly.

The first general election for both wards was held on 8 June 1889.

Messrs Loudon & Finch were returned for Ayers and Messrs W.A. Murray for Anne.

I.J. Goodridge was appointed Ranger 26 July 1890.
