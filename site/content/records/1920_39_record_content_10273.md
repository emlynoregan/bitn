Redruth Court, 28 February & 1 March.

William G. Cossey hairdresser was charged with betting in a public place – the Burra Hotel verandah.  The evidence extends for almost 1¼ columns and the case relied upon what the police said they could see from a shed at the police station and from a fig tree.  Inspection by the bench showed their evidence was confused and had apparently mixed up what had been seen from each site and the case had therefore to be dismissed.
