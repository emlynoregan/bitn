Burra Creek redevelopment is nearing completion on the eastern side of the creek.  The next section to be done will be landscaping the western approach to the pedestrian bridge, together with the construction of a nearby skateboard park.  Designs are also in hand for landscaping and traffic management around the jinker structure, for which construction is expected later in 2012.  The budget for next financial year incorporates a design for a walkway for the creek on the western side from Ursula Lane to the jinker site and the car park opposite the Town Hall.
