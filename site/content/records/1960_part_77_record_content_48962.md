Carols by the Swimming Pool drew a large crowd on Sunday evening in perfect weather.  Chairman of the Burra Burra DC Mr Roy Jeffery delivered his Christmas message.  The greatest event of the year was the amalgamation of the Town and District Councils.  The opening of the Burra Mine is expected to be a reality within a few weeks.  Rev. John Stephenson compered the evening.  A highlight was the tableau presented by the children of St Joseph’s Convent School.  About $XX? Will be forwarded to the Crippled Children’s Association from the evening’s collection.
