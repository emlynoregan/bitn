Mongolata Goldfield

Byles’ Mongolata GM Co. 5th AGM with Chairman of Directors Mr A.A. Thornton presiding.

The present mining activity was located about 16 miles from Burra and about 6 miles northwest of the main Broken Hill Road.  Geologically the field was of great interest as reported by Mr H. Theodore Price, a mining geologist.  Standing on the highest summit of the ridges and looking north-south and east one can plainly see the remains of a coastline of an inland sea with the water replaced by a great fertile plain.  The report tells of a richer lode to the west of the original claim and this area has now been pegged and it is proposed to develop it.  The report says the present position of the mine warrants development.  Development will require driving into the hill 671ft.  In addition to the extension of the tunnel which has so far reached 405ft it will be necessary to sink a shaft to connect up with it at 195ft.  Mr Price suggested the Government should be asked to subsidise the cost of the work.

The meeting resolved that the work should continue and it was optimistic of the future.

Byles’ Mongolata GM Co. to 30 November.

The main tunnel has reached 555ft and crossed several small veins showing no values.

No. 5 shaft has reached 76ft through blue slate with small quartz veins.

Golden Harp.  No. 1 shaft. South drive has advanced to 24ft following very broken lode 3ft wide showing 1oz per ton by pan test.  35 tons at grass will be crushed in the New Year.

Unofficially we understand a small crushing from Baldina Mongolata GM Syndicate realised 9oz from 19cwt with 2oz expected from the tailings.  This is a very good result.
