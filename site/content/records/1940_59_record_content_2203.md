Burra North Police Court.

Case of Gladys M. McGregor for fighting in a public place was resumed.

Defendant said she was riding her pony and saw Mrs Kakoschke coming down the hill.  When she came almost level Mrs Kakoschke picked up a brick and threw it at her, striking her on the side of the face.  Kakoschke then struck her pony on both sides of the head with a whip.  The pony then reared and she slipped off.  Kakoschke then struck the defendant with the whip and she did not remember any more till she regained consciousness after being carried inside by her stepbrother.  Mrs D. Bown and Jim O’Brien were in the home.  Kakoschke had said when she saw the defendant coming ‘Here comes the bitch, I’ll get her now’.  She said she often met the Kakoschke children and gave them sweets, but they threw them away and threw bricks at her.  She did not charge her horse at the children, nor did she start the fight, nor was she guilty of fighting.  The whip belonged to one of the children.  She denied ever hitting the children.  She did not know how Mrs Kakoschke got her injuries or her torn sleeve.  The only injury to herself was to the side of her face.

Considerably more detail is reported.

Gladys McGregor was fined £1-10-0 + 10/- costs.

Mrs Kakoschke was fined £1 + 10/- costs.
