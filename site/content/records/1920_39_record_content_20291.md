Salvation Army.  The number of visiting shows in Burra of late affected the attendance for the Fullarton Girls on 6 August and it was not the success it deserved to be.  They came on Friday and were billeted in the Army Hall where the local officers, Ensign & Mrs Fisher, had made arrangements.  Their performance in march, drill, dialogue and action songs was exceptional.  At Mt Bryan the attendance was very good considering it was a wild boisterous night.  There was a crowded attendance in the Institute for the service on Sunday evening.
