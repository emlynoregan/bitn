Mr O.A. Tattersall, Burra Postmaster, retired last week in his 51st year of service with the Department.  He entered the service in 1914.  He began his term at Burra on 18 August 1965 [sic] and completed it on 26 May 1965.

[Correction 88, 23 (2), 15 June 1965, page 4 to: began his term at Burra 18 August 1950.]

Mr & Mrs Tattersall have had a new home built on Smelts Road, opposite the oval, for their retirement.  A farewell was held in the Post Office on Tuesday 25 May for Mr Tattersall and for ex-postman P.S. Bampton, who has retired through illness.  [Those present are listed.]
