Obituary.  Mr Fred Dew died 20 March.  He was born in 1865, a son of the late Mr & Mrs James Dew of Springbank near Kooringa.  His parents took him to the old home farm known as Blue Bells, when only twelve months old.  Here he spent the greater part of his life, taking over the property on the death of his parents and farming there successfully.  In 1885 he married Miss Adelaide Barber Cullen, eldest daughter of the late Mr & Mrs J. Cullen of Hampton near Burra North.  In 1923 he decided to retire and they made their home at Burra North until his death.  He took a keen interest in public affairs and had served as a Councillor.  He was also Chairman of the Copperhouse School Committee for a period and a member of the Rechabite Lodge for more than 50 years.  He was an indefatigable worker for the Burra Burra Show Inc. where he was a committeeman.  He was active in both the Sheep Dog Trials and the General Show.  His health had been failing for some time and his death was not unexpected.  He is survived by a wife and a family of five children: Olive Mrs E. Wise (Jervois), Win. Mrs A. Przibilla (Strathalbyn), Gordon Dew (Konnongoring WA), Mona Mrs Bob Motherall (Burra) Robert Lance Dew (Northam, WA) and 18 grandchildren and 1 great-grandchild.  The eldest son Bert Dew was killed in action in July 1918.

[Fred Dew born 28 August 1865 Skillogalee, District of Clare: Died 20 March 1941 Burra, residence Burra North.]
