Burra Bowls Associates held their 1st AGM as a separated entity on Thursday 3 October.  President Mrs F. Sims took the chair.  After one season they were in a good financial position.  Eighteen women formed the club at a meeting on 30 October 1956.  The season was very successful with much of that due to Coach Mr George Terry, assisted by Mr R.V. Riggs.  Thanks are also due to Mr Binks-Williams, President of the Men’s Club.  Two tournaments were held: the Championship Singles was won by Mrs Hood and the Pairs by Mesdames Scott and Sims.  At the end of the season the membership was 35.  Elected: President, Mrs F. Sims; Vice-Presidents, Mesdames D. Field & H. Binks-Williams and Secretary, Mrs E. Pietsch.  This year the Burra Associates have affiliated with the SA Women’s Bowling Association.
