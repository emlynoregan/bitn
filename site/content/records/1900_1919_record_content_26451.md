In the Welter the same thing happened with T. Barry’s Sunshine with the veritable Tim Wilks in the saddle.  Four horses ran the race and places were declared, but then something happened [which is not disclosed and appears to be unknown to the reporter] and the race was declared a ‘no start’.  It was then started again and this time Wilks got away and just managed to beat Fortola which had run first in the aborted event.  As the writer not unreasonably observes, if Fortola had not just run two races to Sunshine’s one it would easily have won.
