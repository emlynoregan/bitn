Old Bible Christian Chapel.  Work has started on the re-development of the old Bible Christian Chapel and block on the corner of Kingston St and Paxton Terrace [sic: actually Bridge Terrace].  The chapel will be renovated and a new building, similar to the Cottages in Paxton Square will be erected next to it.  The timber-framed building will be finished in a rendered stone wall finish to blend in with Paxton Square, as recommended by the Heritage Branch of the Department of Environment and Planning.  It is intended the buildings will house a museum outlining the history of Paxton Square and will become the second tourist office in Burra.  The Burra Burra DC will provide $80,000 for the project and the Lewis Trust the remaining $40,000*.  The wooden framework for the new building was erected last week.

The Council raised a loan of $80,000 on behalf of the Lewis Board of Management.  No ratepayer money was involved.  See E.T. Baulderstoneâ€™s letter to the editor at the above place.]
