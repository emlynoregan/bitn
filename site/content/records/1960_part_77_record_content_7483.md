The DLP Meeting at Burra in the RSL Hall on 19 July is reported.  Speakers were Mr J. Schlitz, Country Organiser for the NSW Branch and Mr B.J. Nash.

Mr Schlitz spoke of the growth of Communism and its influence on the ALP and the Trade Unions.

Mr Nash also spoke of the way Communist Russia was able to dominate and control Eastern Europe and he feared the same fate for Australia with respect to Communist China.  Supporting the LCL with preferences was the lesser of two evils he said.
