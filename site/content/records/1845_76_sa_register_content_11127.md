SA Mining Association [Editorial]

The half-yearly meeting of the Association was held yesterday.  The general theme is of continuing and increasing prosperity.  The Directors propose to pay the usual dividends of 100% on the capital.  In the last half-year the yield has been 5,724 tons of ore; an increase on the previous six months of 364 tons.  The produce of the last ‘take’, extending over 9 weeks, amounted to 2,000 tons.  This exceeds any other ‘take’ in the last six years.  The average copper content of ore in the six months was estimated to be 24%.
