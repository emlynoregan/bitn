There will be no program at Burra in 1994.  Booborowie, Hallett and Clare pools will be involved in the program.  Clare is usually fully booked for swimming classes and it is therefore suggested that children of primary school age should enrol at either Booborowie or Hallett.  Please do so before 17 December 1993.
