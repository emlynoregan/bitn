M.A. Radford proposed the SA Field Dog Trials Assoc. (of which I.J. Warnes had been President since its foundation in 1917).

I.J. Warnes then responded.  He spoke first of the dog trials, but then of the history of the area and of the eastern country.  He said that when the outside country leases fell in 1901-03 the Government put up the rents to a comparatively enormous amount and would grant only miscellaneous leases with no security of tenure.  For years this resulted in the land lying idle.  When eventually the rents were reduced the old pioneers went back.  For many years the east was unoccupied on account of the dogs.  The Government stepped in and helped with wire netting.  They did not then, as now, build the fence, but lent the money to do so.  Small boards controlling c. 300 miles looked after the work and the work was done more effectively than now.  He remembered his brother, C.B. Warnes, telling him of Government erected fences 203 feet high over which dogs and even rabbits soon learnt to scramble.  He turned then to troubles.  Shearers complained that the famous sheep had the worst wrinkles in the country.  The blowfly was a curse and there was no adequate control.  Scientists were working on it, but every day sheep died from blowfly strike.  Though wool was high, costs of labour and goods were also 30-40% higher than they used to be.  He then turned to remember past show secretaries: J.D. Cave, J. McLaren & F. Treloar.  The show had first been held at the Smelting Works and then for 15 years at the Recreation Ground [Victoria Park] and for 15 years at the racecourse.  For many years the show had a flower show, a ploughing match, a general show and a banquet.

Mr R.O. O’Halloran MP proposed ‘The New Showgrounds’ and was supported by S. McHugh MP & A.R.G. Hawkes MP.

J.R. Johns & A.B. Riggs spoke and S.H. Robinson proposed ‘Kindred Societies and visitors’ supported by A.D. McDonald, to which Mr Tossell MP responded, supported by G.F. Jenkins and W.H. McWaters.

Mr Foote (Secretary) spoke and Mr Bednall proposed ‘The Press’ to which Mr Marston responded.

[* The first show was in 1877 and so if there had been a show every year since then the 1925 show would have been the 49th, but in fact there were no shows from 1886 to 1893 due to apathy and the show in 1897 was cancelled due to drought and that of 1914 was cancelled due to drought and war.  The 1925 show was therefore the 39th.

† This is at best misleading. Employment numbers declined sharply in the early 1860s with the move of men to the Yorke Peninsula mines and the mine actually closed in 1869.  By October of that year the workforce was 46.  Although the mine reopened as an open cut venture the number of workers never reached the heights of the late 1850s.  When it closed in 1877 about 300 men and boys were thrown out of work.]
