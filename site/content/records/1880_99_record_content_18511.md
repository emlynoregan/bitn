Football by ‘Drop Kick’

Practice is kept up and some good work done, but in the absence of real matches it is apt to get a bit monotonous.  Hothams are coming out top of the Junior Association, so Burra can be proud of drawing with such a team.

The ground, as a place of resort and amusement is a disgrace.  In one place there is long dry rank grass and in another nothing at all, while gravel appears elsewhere.  The Corporation cannot expect much revenue from such a ground.  What is needed is a northern Areas Association or a Country Football Association to end the dearth of matches.

Next season, I hope.
