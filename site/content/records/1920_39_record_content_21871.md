Redruth Court, 21 December

Two young men were charged with offensive behaviour, having been drunk at Porter’s Lagoon on 19 December.  One was fined £5 + 15/- and the other £3 + 15/-.  The paper did not name them because they promised not to drink liquor again for at least two years.

There is also a long report extending for more than 1¾ columns of a case of Thomas Finlay of Farrell’s Flat who was charged with beating and assaulting Herman Krieg.  The case was eventually dismissed.
