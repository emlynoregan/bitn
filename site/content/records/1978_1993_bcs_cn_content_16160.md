BCS.  Staff Profile: Mary Abbott

In transferring to BCS I am returning ‘home’.  I was born in Burra Hospital and lived on our family farm at Farrell Flat.  I attended primary school at Farrell Flat before going on to a boarding school.  I began my teaching career at Poochera on the West Coast and then spent a year at Burra Primary in 1973.  I then travelled overseas for a year and travel remains a great interest.  On returning I spent twelve months in Pt Augusta before transferring to the City, where I have lived ever since.  I am also interested in gardening, reading, music and racquet sports.

Interschool Swimming Carnival at Riverton, 22 February.  Burra brought home all three shields.

They won the Championship Shield for the first time in nine years and the Improvement Shield for the first time in seven years.  The new shield known as the Handicap Shield also went to BCS.

Among the many outstanding efforts, that of Karen Jennings stood out.  She won six events from six starts.  With the relays to come Burra was in third place, but the school won nine of the twelve to gain the outright victory.

At the SASSSA Carnival in Adelaide on 2 March at the North Adelaide Aquatic Centre BCS was elevated two divisions from last year.  The girls won the shield and the boys finished fourth from eight.  The outstanding competitor this time was 12-year-old Many Drew.
