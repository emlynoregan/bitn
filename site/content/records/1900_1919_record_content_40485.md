Offence.  Harry Mendelsohn was charged with stealing 2/6 from A.F. Heinrich at the Burra Races on Saturday by giving short change.  After evidence was tendered he decided to plead guilty and was fined Â£5 plus 14/- costs or one month jail.

He was caught because he had tried the same trick on Thomas P. Halls Sen. who then watched him do it to Heinrich and gave evidence of how it was worked.
