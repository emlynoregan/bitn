CWA

Local members of the SA Country Women’s Assoc. will celebrate the organisation’s 80th birthday on Tuesday.  ‘The association was founded in 1929 with the first SA branch formed in 1926 in Burra by Mary Warnes from Koomooloo.’

[This doesn’t seem to make sense.  The Burra branch was formed in 1926 and a Spalding one followed in 1928.  It spread to Adelaide in 1929 and it seems to be this growth into a connected web of branches that was being celebrated.]

By 1988 there were 270 branches with 7,500 members.  The peak of its activities was reached in 1956 with 277 branches and 14,000 members.  Past and present members are invited to the Burra Town Hall on Tuesday for a handicraft display and to wander through the Mary Warnes Room.  The ‘SACWA Calendar of Cakes’ will be on sale along with other recipe books.
