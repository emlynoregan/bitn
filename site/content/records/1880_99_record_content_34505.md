Burra Town Council, 30 November.

Resolution passed that a deputation wait on the Treasurer, Mr Holder, on Monday morning before he went to Adelaide to ask for a special grant of £50 to repair flood damage to the bridge near Henderson’s.  [Kingston St]

The Overseer reported the destruction of most star thistles.

Grass on the oval to be burnt under supervision.

There was a debate over the adjourned motion for a special payment of £10 to Inspector Gray.  Crs Pinch & Rabbich spoke in support.

Cr Sampson opposed: Mr Gray had worked hard, but had done only what he had contracted to do and he was totally opposed to the way the Inspector had asked the Mayor outside for a special grant or bonus.  He did not like this pulling of strings behind the screens.  [The Mayor, Mr Holder, was absent from this meeting.]

Cr O’Leary said he was surprised at the mayor’s absence when he had promised to be there.  He (O’Leary) had promised to support the motion, but since then had found the ratepayers were opposed.  He would have to vote against.

Cr Hardy was surprised by O’Leary’s change over a few ratepayers’ comments, but he himself had always opposed the motion, believing it would set a poor precedent.  He also regretted O’Leary’s reflection on the Mayor who was kept in Adelaide by pressure of business and had sent an apologetic telegram.

Cr Rabbich said he had originally supported the idea, but now having heard of ratepayer opposition would consent to withdrawing the motion if the seconder agreed.

Matters then grew somewhat disorganised and ultimately the Council divided on the matter.  When they voted Cr Pinch alone supported the motion and Cr Rabbich abstained.

Cr Sampson moved Cr Rabbich be fined for not voting, but this failed to find a seconder.
