Burra Show Society’s Toilet Fund has been boosted by about $1,200 as the result of a lottery run by the society in conjunction with a cabaret organised by the Rural Youth Club.  The lottery was won by Mrs M.T. Kellock who donated $500 of the $750 prize to the Show Society Fund.  [Other winners are listed.]

Before Saturday the fund stood at about $400.  Now the fund is just over half way to its target of $4,000.
