F.L. Kerr, Director of Emergency Fire Services in SA was guest speaker at the AGM of the Burra District Emergency Fire Service on 30 August in the RSL Rooms.  Attendance of local residents was very poor; only five attended.  Mr Kerr explained details of the new Bush Fires Act and congratulated the Burra Burra DC on buying a fire-fighting truck to be placed in the hands of the Mt Bryan Fire Fighting Organisation.  The good season will provide fuel for the coming fire season.
