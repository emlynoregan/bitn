A Bolt.  Dan Mahoney, employed by W.T. Truscott, butcher of Kooringa, was thrown from the cart at the Bon Accord Hotel on Thursday, when the horse plunged forward.  He required several stitches to a severe cut under the lip.  The horse then made off towards Kooringa, but was soon halted by workmen.
