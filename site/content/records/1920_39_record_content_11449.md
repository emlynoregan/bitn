RSL Annual Dinner was held in the Scout Hall last Saturday.  The Soldiers’ Aid Society again provided the dinner.  The Hall was beautifully decorated with almond and wattle blossom.  Dr. Steele, President, said that two years ago they had 200 financial members.  Last year there were 90 and this year 50.  Though the executive and committee could accept some blame, the difficulty was shown in the unveiling of the memorial when they sent out 260 circulars requesting merely a yes or no answer.  They received 60 replies.  Monthly socials failed.  The boys would not respond.  The Federal Government is overlooking the returned man and if they will, so will employers etc.  In unity is strength and if the League loses its members it will lose its influence.  He felt Germany was in danger of disintegration and that could mean another war.  In September he would not be standing again for President.

Mr Maggs also spoke (State Organiser of the League).  He was more hopeful for the League.  New branches were still being formed.  The League was doing a lot for many of the returned men with disabilities and in getting back-pay and pensions and in assisting soldier-settlers etc.

The Mayor proposed the ‘War-working Societies’ and Mr Radford replied.

Mr Maggs proposed the Burra Branch and Mr Hammond responded.

Dr Steele thanked the Soldiers’ Aid Soc. and Miss Bubb responded.
