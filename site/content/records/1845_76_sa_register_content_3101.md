W.H. Challoner, Mine accountant, explained the recording of the ore raised etc.  He recognised the plaintiff’s diary when handed it.  He had seen Mr Burra assaying a few weeks before he left the mine – though not earlier.

He knew some cottages were built by Taylor and were in some measure without foundations.  Floors were beneath the outer surface.

Henry Roach, Mine Captain, said he took the samples for assay.  He had seen Burr assay by wet process, but not by fire, shortly before he left.

He recalled the Directors’ visit in June, when Hoskins was dismissed and heard Burr say he would back him (Hoskins) against any man in the colony for assaying.

[Further evidence was given relating to the 6,550 tons of ore on the dressing floor and of other details of operations at the mine.]

J.E. Phillips, clerk at the SA Mining Association Office gave some evidence.

James Trewartha, Government Mineral Surveyor, gave evidence of how ore samples were taken.

Edward Davy, Surgeon, gave further evidence of assaying and sampling.

Andrew Robins, miner at Burra Burra, gave evidence of hearing of the new rules on how assays would be conducted and used.  He also lived in one of Taylor’s cottages, paid 3/- a week for it and had no cause for complaints regarding it.

John Hailes, miner at the Bon Accord, had worked at the Burra Burra Mine for two years and gave evidence on sampling processes.

Richard James, miner, living in the Creek at Burra Burra, gave further evidence on sampling techniques.

The case was then adjourned.
