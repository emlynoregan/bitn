Kooringa News, 11 November

Arson.  At about 3 p.m. on Sunday 10 November a man was seen near Cobb & Co.’s paddock on the Mt Bryan Road.  A quarter of an hour later the grass where he had been was alight.  A few people extinguished it and found at its origin a candle, some paper and dry grass.  The wheat around was green and confined the fire to Messrs Hallett’s Run.  Only the greenness of the growth prevented the fire from causing serious mischief and allowed residents to get it out.  An inquest will be held.
