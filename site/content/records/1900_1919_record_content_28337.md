A Notable Car Trip.

W.J. Richards conveyed John Collins and Mr Edwards (a relative) from Collinsville north on the 8 December in a 12 h.p. Talbot, to inspect new grazing country near Lake Frome.  They left Collinsville at 5 a.m. and got to Yunta about noon.  They proceeded via Waukaringa and Mt Victor to Coonamore and Curnanona, arriving by 6 p.m. having gone some 180 miles.  The next day they went via Coondappie, Wilpina and Outowie to Frome Downs, about 40 miles.  After travelling about 246 miles in all, including inspecting part of the property, the party started back and reached Frome Downs that night.  They left the next morning at 5 a.m. and reached Curnamona in two hours.  They reached Yunta for lunch, leaving at c. 2 p.m. and were at Terowie by 6 p.m. and Collinsville by 7.15 p.m.  They covered 260 miles for the day and over 500 in the three days â€“ all without a hitch.
