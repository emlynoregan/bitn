Burra Town Council, 20 August

W. Voumard wrote seeking medical expenses for his son hurt recently in the gas light explosion.  Full time had been paid while he was ill and the father was referred to the Workman’s Compensation Act.

A.J. & P.A. McBride advise that they do not wish to sell the ‘Hospital’ Quarry.

Redruth Methodist Trust offers metal from the foundation work of the new Sunday school room and they will cart it.  Accepted.

Burra Bachelors’ Ball at The Institute last Friday was a success and is reported in just over 1 column.
