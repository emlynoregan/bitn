Burra Benevolent Society held its AGM 15 June.  Elected were President, Rev. J.A. Andrews; Vice-Presidents, Rev. V. Secombe, The Mayor & Mrs A.B. Riggs; Secretary, Miss H. Wilkinson & Treasurer, Mr E.J. Davey.

The past year has seen a good deal of practical work.  Cases of sickness are never refused and families have been helped where men were out of work.  Gifts of clothing have been received with thanks.  Christmas cheer of 5/- each went to 29 of the poorer folk â€“ mainly pensioners with 5/- extra where children were involved.
