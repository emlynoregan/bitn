SA Mining

Since our last summary the works at the Burra Burra Mine have been resumed with vigour.  The great engine at the Mine reduced the level of water with great rapidity and it is now ‘in fork’.  The levels have been examined and the Mine is pronounced fully secure.  The Company is employing as many men as it can obtain and its prosperity is at present limited only by the scanty and costly supply of labour.

The SA Government has offered a reward of £2,000 for the discovery of a good coal field and of £1,000 for the discovery of an anthracite or lignite coal field.

The inducements offered for the discovery of gold have been unavailing.  Echunga has been the only field to date and there the number of diggers has increased of late.  No great gains have been reported from there, but persevering hands find that on the whole it is more remunerative than the average wages of labour.
