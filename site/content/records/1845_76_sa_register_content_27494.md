The Burra Mine

Captain Sanders reports good progress in sinking Morphett’s Shaft.  About eight feet has been sunk in the past four weeks and more would have been achieved, but for the influx of water from the 70 north on new lode.  This has necessitated fitting a larger lift at the 70.  Four men are cutting plat on the north end of Morphett’s Shaft at the 70.  This is necessary for starting a crosscut east to Tinline’s Lode and also to make the shaft available for hauling with skips; the former plat being on the engine side, rather than the hauling side of the shaft.  At Waterhouse’s 60 the crosscut east is about 15 fathoms and letting out so much water that the men can do little.  If Tinline’s Lode is cut at his level nearly all the water from the north part of the mine can be diverted through this crosscut.  In Peacock’s Shaft, if the old plans are correct, we should have holed the 50 fathom level to the long crosscut from Ayer’s to Graves’.  Work is pushing on; hoping to hole shortly.  Sinking at Bunce’s is slow in hard ground.  This shaft lies between two old deposits of ore and no ore is expected until the shaft reaches 22 fathoms, when crosscuts can be made to the lodes.
