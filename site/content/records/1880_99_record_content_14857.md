W.H. Hardy writes objecting to the appointment of Mr Bartle at Waterworks Engineer when others tendered for nearly £30 p.a. less and he claims it was all arranged well before the tenders were opened.  He also suggests that Bartle couldn’t light a fire under the boiler without first receiving instruction.

[He does not however, mention that he was himself one of the tenderers for the job.]
