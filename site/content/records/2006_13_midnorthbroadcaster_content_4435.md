Phoenix Copper announced a public float last Thursday, aiming to raise $10 million to see SA’s copper heritage burgeon again.  The boom in copper prices has initiated renewed interest in exploration.  The company will seek copper-gold deposits and says the present prices would give the opportunity to mine otherwise sub-marginal deposits profitably.  The company will use advanced techniques in geology and geophysics.  The former ‘Monster Mine’ is one of their prime targets, given that the possible sulphide source of the ‘Monster Mine’ has never been discovered.  Goyder Council’s acting CEO, Bill Mader anticipates proposed plans might be quite interesting for the town.  The company will also be interested in areas around Spalding, Mongolata and Minlaton.
