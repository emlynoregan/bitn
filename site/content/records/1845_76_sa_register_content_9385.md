G.D. Kingston writes to thank his supporters in the election, regretting that he cannot remain in Kooringa for the declaration of the poll, because of business commitments in the city.  He says that his opponent agreed with all of the principles Kingston himself espoused and remarkably did not press his candidacy either with addresses in the newspaper or in person.  Kingston says in fact that Mildred’s proponents ‘only brought him forward, to use their own terse and expressive language, “for the sake of a lark, and that some money might be spent at the public-house.”’

‘How far such men are deserving of the high privilege of the elective franchise, I leave their fellow-colonists to judge.’

Mildred ‘only made his appearance the evening before the poll, and was then only seen, owl-like, after a stealthy journey by night – ashamed, as it were, to show his face in the light of the sun.’
