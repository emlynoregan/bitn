The Holidays

Trumpets and other ‘musical’ instruments sounded out on Christmas Eve and shopping was brisk.  Fruiterers did particularly well.

A cricket match at Victoria Park between St Mary’s and Broken Hill (in truth old Burra Boys) resulted in a win for the latter.

Christmas Day fell on a Sunday and proceedings were appropriately solemn with special sermons and a special afternoon at the Kooringa Wesleyan Church.

Boxing Day brought Burra Sports at the Polo Ground in Aberdeen.  All passed off very well.

The results are printed, but the report is held over.

[Personal interest:

F.C. Fuss was 2nd in the 1 mile bicycle handicap, 1st in the 3 mile bicycle handicap and 1st in the 2 mile bicycle handicap.  Presumably this was Frederick Charles Fuss born 1 April 1878, the son of Frederick William Fuss then of Redruth.]
