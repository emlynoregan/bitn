Soon after the semi-finals started Mr Weatherill, Secretary of the Mt Bryan Cricket Club said in his view the rules said Mt Bryan had already won the premiership regardless of the finals, due to a failure to alter one of last yearâ€™s rules when the new rules were made.  I approached Mr Radford as Chairman of the Association and his opinion was that points counted in finals and semi-finals and so with Kooringa 3 points behind Mt Bryan a 4 point win over them would give Kooringa the premiership without the need for a challenge match.
