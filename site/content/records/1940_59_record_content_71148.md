Burra Hospital

Last Year instead of an annual fete the Women’s Organisations decided to raise money by individual branch efforts throughout the district.  As a result £763-3-0 was handed over to the Chairman of the Board of Management, Mr S.J .Woollacott, on 20 December.  Mrs Jennison said in making the handover that this result was better than anticipated and without the huge effort required for a fete.  The Chairman then invited the representatives of the organisations to inspect the work of repair and re-painting carried out.  The Isolation Block, which is to be used as the Nursing Sisters’ Home, has been painted and new rubber laid in the passage.  The nurses’ dining room has been re-painted and has new curtains.  The Men’s Ward was re-painted and has new curtains and the passage was re-painted.  The old bathrooms were demolished and converted into a storeroom.  New operating instruments were purchased and new linen and cutlery.  Early this year the operating theatre will be re-painted as well as the casualty room, duty room, passages and front hall and a new hot water system will be installed.  Matron Herbert, the new matron, was welcomed on the same day.  Contributions:

Burra CWA	£200

Mt Bryan CWA	£112-7-0

Booborowie CWA	£100

Hanson CWA	£20

Farrell Flat CWA	£10-9-0
