Kooringa News, 24 December

Last Thursday evening Mr G. Droege delivered his very interesting and instructive lecture on New Zealand at the Burra Institute.  The audience was very small due in part to the dramatic entertainment at the Burra Hotel, but chiefly to a general lack of interest in such matters.

At the Burra Hotel the dramatic entertainment was provided by the well-known polyphonist [i.e. a ventriloquist] H.J. Hall.  He was quite well patronised on this and subsequent evenings.

The annual examination at Mr Bennett’s school at Redruth took place last Thursday.  Few except those nominated as examiners attended.  The pupils acquitted themselves well.

On Friday Mr J.R. Stephens’ school was examined.  This was pretty well attended by parents and friends.  Again the pupils acquitted themselves very well.  In the evening Mr Stephens entertained the students and their parents with a magic lantern show.

The Kooringa Primitive Methodist Sunday School held its special anniversary services last Sunday.  Sermons were delivered by Rev. Mr Standrin and Rev. W. Davidson.  The annual tea and public meeting will be held on Thursday 26 December.

There seems little bustle in preparations for Christmas this year.  Indeed the weather has been so unlike the characteristics of even an Australian Christmas that we cannot realise the season is upon us.  ‘In fact, it don’t seem like Christmas at all.’
