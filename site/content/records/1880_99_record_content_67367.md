Aberdeen Ballast Quarry Accident.

Last Wednesday morning a fatal accident occurred in the Aberdeen Quarry at 11 a.m.  George Robert Allen, aged 21, was working as a shunter.  He got an empty truck in motion with a horse and ran alongside it with the presumed intention of putting down the break [sic] and fixing the sprag on the opposite side.  He tripped over a pile of stones and fell under the wheels of the truck which passed over his body, chest and left arm, severely crushing and lacerating him.  He was extricated from the wheels by foreman ganger Keys and his brother John Allen and conveyed to the mouth of the quarry.  Dr Brummitt came at once and ordered his removal home.  He lived about 40 minutes after the accident, but was not heard to speak and succumbed to his injuries before reaching home.  The deceased was a fine strapping young man, very steady and careful in the execution of his duties and bore an excellent character from his officers and fellow workmen.  The funeral took place on Thursday afternoon and was largely attended: 56 fellow workers marched as a last token of respect.  Rev. W.H. Rofe, Wesleyan minister officiated.

Inquest.

The inquest heard from various witnesses who all confirmed the above.  The only matter at issue was the pile of stone he tripped over which the railways were clearly anxious not to be blamed for.  The pile of metal was removed before it could be inspected.  The verdict was that it was an accident with no blame attachable to anyone.  ‘The jurymen graciously decide to hand over their fees to the parents of the deceased.’
