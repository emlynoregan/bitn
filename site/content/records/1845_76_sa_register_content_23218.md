Northern Mail Arrangements.  On Tuesday for the first time mail for Clare was sent to Riverton by train instead of to Kapunda and thence by coach.  The return mail leaves Clare at 5.30 a.m. and the contractors are Hall & Partridge.  Arrangements are deemed unsatisfactory for passengers as they will be unable to get to town by the midday train, unless they get to Kapunda by the Burra coach.  Many say the mails would be better taken to Hamilton by coach from Kapunda and thence to Clare by Cobbâ€™s bus.  Cobb & Co. will run a coach from Clare at 10.30 to meet the train at Saddleworth.  This will all change when the line is opened to Redruth when it is expected there will be two trains a day on the northern line as well as on the Kapunda line.
