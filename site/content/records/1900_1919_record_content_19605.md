Burra Institute.  The gas lights failed at the Institute on Thursday night during the performance of the Ada Delroy Company.  24lb of carbide ought to have served, but ‘the large lights above the stage consumes more carbide than the lights are useful.’  The performance itself was very favourably reviewed.  It was the return of this company after c. 10 years.
