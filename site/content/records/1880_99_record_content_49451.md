‘Be Careful ____ Bad intentions vide so called Leader to Day’s Record But I have written before the Copy was ever intended for publication in your (?) paper and it bore strong Internal evidence INALTO RELIEVO to that effect ____ It was simply meant as EMETI ____ CARTHARTIC ____ The IMPRINATUS of the Record states that it Is printed and PUBLISHED by W.J. DAVEY I shall make the said W.J. Davey responsible For everything Slander – our – or of a U B BLODE type in the Record hence it will pay you to keep your EYE OPEN I am watching to see when BAIT is used this time on Your hook Remember Firm and fearless &c is a lie take it out or don’t Pander

Yours WITH BOTH EYES OPEN

Feb 3/92 	OUOs’

Symon asked if the U B BLODE section was a reflection on what Hardy thought Davey’s article on the vote of censure in the Feb. 3 paper was worth.

Hardy, ‘Yes.’

Symon, ‘In the sentence ‘firm and fearless’ etc. you meant to convey the motto was a lie?’

Hardy, ‘Yes.’

When asked if a series of his statements were meant to be offensive Hardy replied,

‘No, not necessarily.’

He said the postcard held by the postmaster, Mr Lane, was held because there was no name put to it, not because it was offensive.  When pressed, Hardy said of Mr Lane,

‘I don’t know what he did say.’

Bur when asked if he understood from Lane that it was not quite so respectable as it ought to be Hardy said yes.
