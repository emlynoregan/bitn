Hallett School Closure

A celebration was held at the Hallett School last Thursday, 26 September to mark its closure after 116 years.  Children from Hallett were joined by those from Spalding and Booborowie for a day of fun and recognition.  Numbers at the school had dropped to nine.  Principal Shane Misso said in 1977 there were 74 at the school and at the start of 1996 there were 18.  This fell to 10 as families left the district.  [Photo of Mr Misso and students.]
