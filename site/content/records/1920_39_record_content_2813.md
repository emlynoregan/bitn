Fallen Soldiers Memorial

E.W. Crewes presided at a meeting at the Institute on Tuesday.  The contractor advises that he has everything ready for the foundation stone to be laid in February next.  When all promises have been fulfilled the amount in hand will be c. £1,475.  The contract for the monument without name plates is £2,184.  To complete the memorial and a Roll of Honour for all the men who enlisted would probably cost another £1,500.  He felt that once work had actually begun promises would be redeemed and more donations would come in.

Mr Hammond as a newcomer thought the Rotunda needed to be enlarged – it did not accommodate the band – and indeed the whole square should be beautified.

This was ruled to be a different matter for another day.

The inscription of the foundation stone was then discussed.  The Mayor said he had assumed it would say something to the effect that the stone was laid by the Governor or whoever performed the ceremony.  Mr Lane thought the RSL should have a say.  Mr Lawn thought it had been agreed that the only names to appear on the memorial would be those of the fallen.  Mr Hawkes agreed.  The agreement finally was that the wording would be ‘To Our Glorious Dead.’  February 23 was fixed for the day, but since then the Governor has advised he cannot perform the ceremony until the end of March.  A committee was appointed to choose the program for the day.  Dr Steele said they had now to decide the names to go on the memorial.  This was not entirely straightforward: some who died had never embarked, some died after returning home, some were Burra boys who had enlisted elsewhere.  A sub-committee will be appointed at the next general meeting to deal with this issue.
