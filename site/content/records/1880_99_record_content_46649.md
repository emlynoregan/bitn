Burra Town Council, 5 September.

Cr Watt had been to Adelaide and while there had tried to find out about proposals for the Bon Accord crossing, but failed to learn anything.

A letter was received from the Commissioner of Railways re the recent accident at the Bon Accord crossing stating it was due to reckless driving.

Resolved that the fireplug stones be raised so they can be found when wanted.

T.P. Halls waited on Council asking for the restoration of his cab licence, saying he had signed the pledge and did not intend to take any intoxicating drinks any more and was going into business on his own account.

Mr F. Schultz also asked the Council to grant him a cab licence again.

It was resolved that these matters stand over.

T.W. Rabbich moved that the petitions re the Baldina Irrigation Scheme be laid on the table.

If the Baldina Creek scheme was a success, as he was confident it would be, it could be repeated with the World’s End and Newikie Creeks.

Cr Hardy moved a petition on protection for the Bon Accord crossing be prepared.  Carried.
