The Governor, accompanied by Mr Blackmore, returned to Adelaide yesterday, having left last Wednesday for Gawler.  From there he drove to Mr James Masters’ Saddleworth Lodge.  From there he drove to auburn and thence to Mintaro, where he visited the annual exhibition of the Northern Agricultural Society and a bazaar to aid the Wesleyan Minister’s residence.  He spent the afternoon at Mr Edward Bowman’s Martindale Hall.  After spending the night there, he left at noon on Friday for Mr E.B. Gleeson’s at Clare.  On the way he called in at Seven Hills College, where he was welcomed by Rev. Joseph Tappeiner and Rev. Pallhuber as well as one of the classes.  There are at present about 22 boarders and it is intended to increase the accommodation.  He also visited the chapel, garden, winehouse and cellars, managed by Mr John Schreiner.  On Saturday he returned to Saddleworth Lodge.  He attended Riverton Church on Sunday, where Rev. Mr Strickland conducted the service.  He later drove to Gawler, where he stayed at Martin’s Railway Hotel and returned to Adelaide in time to hold an Executive Council at noon, at which Hon. E.C. Gwynne was sworn in as Third Judge of the Supreme Court.
