Obituary.  John Oswald Lihou, son of Mr & Mrs T. Lihou of Burra, died at Burra hospital on 15 November aged 46 years 3 months.  He was educated at Burra School and left at 13 to learn the blacksmithing trade.  He later went north with the family and was employed at casual jobs on stations until age 21.  He then took a position on Waudnaminga Station for Mr E.J. Andrews, where he remained for 24 years.  Eighteen months ago he gave up the position for health reasons and went to live in Truro.  He volunteered for service in WWII, but was not accepted, though he did much to help the cause on the home front.  He is survived by his parents, his sister, Mrs L.T. Phillips of World’s End and his brother, Mr Norman Lihou of Yarramba Station.

[Born 8 August 1902 at Kooringa.  Birth registered as Gibbs and Stasinowsky.  He adopted his step-father’s surname.]
