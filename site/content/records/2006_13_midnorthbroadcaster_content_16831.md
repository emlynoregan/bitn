[This short article needs a little untangling.

Trixie Pearce was more formally Beatrice Eleanor Pearce 1885-1927, known generally as Trix.

Her sister Nell was Victoria Nellie Pearce, who married Archibald Dearlove.

It was her sister Miss Gertrude Pearce (1875-1949) who worked for the Burra Record; being a journalist on the staff for 26½ years until she retired in January 1944.

There was no Ladies Mounted Band.  The young women of the Cheer-up Society in Burra formed the Burra Cheer-up Ladies’ Band, which appeared first in February 1917.  It was seen as necessary as the town band had been so depleted by enlistments for war service.  It was never mounted.  The confusion originated when a group of 42 young women, mounted on horses, formed a guard of honour for the Governor when he visited Burra in October 1915.  The Governor was so impressed that he asked them to go to Adelaide the following month to repeat their performance when he opened the Cheer-up Hut.

Above: a photograph of a couple of dozen of the Cheer-up Ladies on their mounts on the banks of the Burra Creek with Kingston Street Bridge in the background.

The reference to the Charge of the Light Brigade is a little misplaced.  That occurred on 25 October 1854 during the Battle of Balaclava in the Crimean War.

The reference should be to the famous charge by the Australian Light Horse in the battle to take Beersheba on 31 October 1917.  It was in this attack that Lieut. Reg. Sandland (not Sandlands) lost his life.  Lieut. Norman McBride of the 3rd Light Horse was also killed in action in Palestine on 22 December 1917.]
