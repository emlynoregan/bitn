Burra Town Council, 4 December

SAR advises that it considers the station road is satisfactory for traffic at15 m.p.h.  Councillors think it a disgrace.

The Minister of agriculture advises Â£350 is available to enable local Councils to purchase fire-fighting equipment.  Council believes the fire brigade is sufficient to cover Town Council Area requirements.

Manpower seeks aid in rostering volunteers to carry out domestic work at the hospital.

[While the cause for this is not spelled out, the comments suggest there was an industrial dispute over wages.]

Emergency Fire Services write offering a trailer pump and equipment rejected as unsuitable by the Burra Burra DC.

Cr Kellaway proposed they find out if they would be allowed to send it out of the town, as the local brigade was not allowed to do so.
