Editorial: Christmas Wishes.

Thomas Bath, a former resident who has returned to live in England for some years, has sent £2-2-0 for prizes for children in State Schools in the district.

Kooringa Bible Christian Church.  The Service of Song Little Dot was performed on Sunday afternoon with Rev. R.C. Yeoman giving the connective readings.  Unfavourable weather made attendance moderate.

Pleuropneumonia has been found last week in some cattle east of Burra.  Two lots of c. 150 have been quarantined by Inspector Needham.  Inoculation has been halted because Mr Needham was injured by a nasty kick from a bullock.

Mrs Frances Knorr, on 15 December, was found guilty of murdering an infant child at Brunswick, Melbourne, and was sentenced to death.  She is believed to be the woman who came to Burra in April 1892 and posing as a dressmaker duped several tradespeople.  [She obtained payment in advance for orders as well as getting materials on credit.]

School Competition.  In mid-February 1894 there will be an exhibition of art and schoolwork and a cooking competition in connection with the district.  Proceeds will go to prizes for successful competitors of the various schools and other exhibiters.
