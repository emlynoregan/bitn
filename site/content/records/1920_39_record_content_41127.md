He was born in Hutt St in 1842.  When a young boy they went to the Barossa where his father had land.  About 1852 they bought a farm at Mintaro.  Mr Miller then became a bullock driver and as soon as he could yoke and handle a team he worked for a living engaged in carting ore from Burra to Pt Wakefield and Pt Adelaide.  They did the trip for six or seven years till the mine closed.*  Then Giles Miller went to Blinman and carted from there to Pt Augusta, often going 10 days or a fortnight without meat unless they caught a goanna or a wallaby.  He recalls seeing a fight between about 20 lubras while their men were out hunting.  They used yam sticks and waddies.  After about two years there he returned to Mintaro and later took land on his own account at Baldry (later called Leighton).  His first experience of ploughing was with 6-8 bullocks on a single-furrow wooden plough with no wheels.  He then obtained 800 acres under the cultivation clause in the Hundred of Wonna and when poor seasons forced the sale of the Baldry property he moved to Wonna.  There he farmed and kept a few sheep and added another 800 acres.  Better farming methods and higher prices put him on his feet and he now has (in 1927) an additional 490 acres near Hallett and shears c. 1,400 sheep.  His land is let on halves, but he had not cropped any in 1927.  He was one of a family of 11 of whom 3 survived [in 1927.]  He smoked till about 45 years ago, but ‘has shown more sense since’.  When he bought land at Baldry he married Miss Pearce of Mintaro and had a family of 13 children, five of whom survive.  [* This sentence cannot be correct.  He married in 1868 and he spent, he says two years in the north before that and some time at Mintaro.  The Burra Mine closed in 1868 for conversion to open cut, but the cartage to Pt Wakefield and Pt Adelaide ceased when the railway reached Gawler in 1857, though they might have continued to cart ore to the railhead.]
