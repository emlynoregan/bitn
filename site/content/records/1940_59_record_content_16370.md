Fire Brigade & Grass Fires

The Fire Brigade Board advises that the equipment is designed for fighting building fires.  No definite instructions could be given.  Firemen could attend grass fires only if it was within a reasonable distance of a water main, also removing a brigade to fight a grass fire raises questions of what would happen if a town fire occurred while the men were away.  Cr Kellaway said all this missed the point that the fire that provoked the question was within the protected area.  A second letter clarifying this will be sent.
