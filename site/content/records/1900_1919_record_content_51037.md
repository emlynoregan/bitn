L-Cpl Stanley Charles Bishop, aged 18, has been awarded the Military Medal.  He enlisted in Kooringa in July 1915 when he was 17 and sailed on 2 July.  [Something is clearly wrong here!  He was farewelled in December 1915 so it may have been 2 January 1916 rather than 2 July 1915.]  After some time in Egypt he was posted to France about 12 months ago.  Two other brothers enlisted, Hedley and Clarrie.  Clarrie was killed 14 August 1916.  [Officially 16 August 1916.]

[Hedley was Andrew Hedley.]
