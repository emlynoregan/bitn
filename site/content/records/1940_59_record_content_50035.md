Railway Accident.  This morning the locomotive hauling the 5 oâ€™clock freight to Terowie jumped the points at the north end of the Burra Railway Station and was derailed.  The mobile crane had to be sent from Islington to re-rail the engine.  The Broken Hill express was able to get through on another track, but the 7.05 a.m. railcar to Adelaide was blocked and could not depart.
