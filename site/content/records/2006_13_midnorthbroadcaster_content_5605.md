The Arrival of the Talbot Car in July has prompted the Burra History Group to gather some information on the journey and those involved.  Mr Aunger (1878-1953) has a Burra connection.  As early as June 1900 he visited Burra and won a 2 mile cycle race and by 1907 he was famous as a champion cyclist.  In 1910 Murray Aunger Ltd of Adelaide established a branch garage in Burra that operated until he left the company in 1917.  In this period (c. 1913) he built the body of a Newton Bennett car for Dr J.I. Sangster [Jnr] of Burra.  The doctor died soon after taking delivery of it and Mr C.B. Warnes purchased it and used it for pulling scrub at Woolgangi.  Les Warnes and his brother Charley are nephews of C.B. Warnes and recall using the vehicle for rabbit shooting expeditions.  The car passed to Les in 1936 when he was 14.  It was then used as a farm working vehicle, though in 1940 he drove it to Adelaide for a veteran car rally.  The car was restored by Ian Tilbrook of Adelaide in 1970.  The foot brake operates on the tail shaft, which means braking is minimal.

The Talbot will be in Burra on 3 & 4 July.  [Photo of it in Commercial Street, Burra, in 1908.]
