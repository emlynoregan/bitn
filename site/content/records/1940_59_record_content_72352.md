Voluntary labour could be valued for the purpose of calculating the subsidy.  The maximum Government contribution would be £1,500.

A subscription list has been established and donations will be acknowledged in the Burra Record.  Investigations into the old [pre-WWII] subscriptions showed that about £184 had been subscribed and of this about £60 had been expended in plans etc. leaving about £112, which was held in trust by the Burra Town Council and with interest had grown to c. £180.

Some people thought the sum placed in trust was c. £400, but they be confused with the Centenary Celebrations Fund, which was about that amount.
