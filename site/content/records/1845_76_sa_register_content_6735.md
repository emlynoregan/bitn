NSW Gold Diggings

The news seems to indicate that the discoveries are in a very limited area.  Great numbers of people have left their usual employment to go to the fields.  The defection of Newcastle coal miners has seen the price of coal in Sydney rise to extraordinary levels.  Gold mining, like any other mining, needs to be organised and conducted systematically.  To rush in helter skelter with every man for himself is to court disaster.  Such has been the case in California; where 99% would have been better off had they never gone.

[The writer goes on to explain why for men in SA in work or who can generally obtain it their best chance of getting gold is by remaining where they are.  He also points out the high cost of living on the goldfields and suggests that even if men went to Sydney they are as likely to do well taking the jobs of those who have left for the goldfields as by going there themselves.]
