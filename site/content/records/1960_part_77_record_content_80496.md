Salad Days was a delightful production by the Burra Community Entertainment Group last Thursday and Friday nights, as their first effort.  Edith Carpenter excelled herself in producing the show.  The production had excellent lighting effects, costumes, scenery and props and Kath Millard and Dick Cuttle as the principal singers were extremely well chosen.  The whole cast performed very well.  Special mention is made of Liz Fahey, Ian Knowles, Bev. Farrelly, Ruth & Wally Spehr, Patricia McGuire, Stephen Angel, Cathy Button and Coral Billington.
