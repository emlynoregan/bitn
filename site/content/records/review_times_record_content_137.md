Burra Tourism.  A small group met to discuss improvements to the oval and to tourist facilities.  The sports clubs using the site were represented and a sub-committee was formed to look at possible projects.  Plans will be drawn up for a clubroom including change rooms, bar facilities and an entertainment area.  Improved toilet facilities would enable the oval to take an overflow from the caravan park.
