Launching of Burra & District – A Pictorial Memoir compiled by Ian Auhl.  It was launched at Baldina Homestead by Dame Nancy Buttfield.  Mr Gerry O’Connor as President of the Burra Burra Branch of the National Trust welcomed guests and introduced Dame Nancy and her husband.  Dame Nancy’s great grandmother was Mrs Holden, 1st Matron of the Redruth Girls’ Reformatory.  She had taken to the workforce on being widowed and suffering the effects of the depression of the 1880s and had worked at Magill and Edwardstown before coming to Burra.  Ian Auhl thanked Dame Nancy for her generosity in launching the book.  At the launch Burra Pottery had an interesting stall and so did the Eastern Dorcas Society.  The Golf Club served tea and soft drinks.
