Burra Town Council, 23 July.

Some slight improvement has been made in the Mortuary Chapel at the cemetery during the progress of the work.  It is to have additional iron stays and the inside roof will be painted white.

SAMA wrote offering a 999-year lease on the Recreation Ground.  Council had believed freehold had been promised.  Discussion was deferred.
