Seconded by Cr Hardy and supported by Mr Fuss and Doctors Sangster Sen. & Jnr.  Mr McLaren spoke against it, but the motion was carried with only 3 of the approximately 70 attending dissenting.  The mayor has passed on the result to the Federal authorities and it is anticipated that renovation work on the old post office will soon commence.
