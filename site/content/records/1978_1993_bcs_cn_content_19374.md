Women in the Mid North 1900-1950.  Research by Bernie Fahey, BCS Year 12 History.

My grandmother Bridget Hollitt was born in 1899 and went to Teachers’ Training College in Currie Street, Adelaide.  After  only three weeks she was appointed as a teacher.  She did not want to be a teacher, but there was no choice.  My other grandmother Ralda Fahey was a live-in helper when she was 17, for 15 shillings a week.  She worked 12 hours a day with no days off, but an occasional weekend free.

Mrs Gladys Slatter worked as a telephonist at Hallett when 19 or 20.  Every morning she had to ring all the town subscribers to check that the telephones were working.  There were three girls who worked in shifts and men took over at night.  For full-time workers the wage was c. £3 a week.  Women had to leave this job when they married or turned 21.

Mrs Olly Pohlner trained to be a teacher.  At Peterborough H.S. she earned £5 per fortnight.  When she was a student at Woodville H.S. boys and girls were strictly divided.  On the train to school girls rode in the back carriages and the boys in the front one.  Girls walked on the left hand side of the footpath and boys on the right hand side.  Girls were not allowed to talk to boys.

Mrs Maggie Quinn began primary school at Willalo when aged 6 and then went to the Convent in Terowie, which was a boarding school for girls from all over SA.  The nuns were very strict, but the girls got a good education.

Mrs Nellie Brooks attended the Spalding Convent, which had five teaching nuns who were also very strict.  During the depression her family lived on rabbiting and rations for more than two years.
