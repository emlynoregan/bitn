Weather.  Rain fell to the east on Saturday in very variable amounts.  Most places got less than 30 points, but a few did well.  Sturt Vale recorded 70 and filled 4 dams, Faraway Hill with 32 half-filled two dams and Pine Valley reported 63 points.

Mrs Roy Scroopâ€™s cat took six months to return to Burra when she moved to Adelaide.  She collected him recently and we are waiting to see if he repeats the 100 mile walk.
