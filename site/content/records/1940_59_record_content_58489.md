Burra Primary School Committee.

The President reported a particularly satisfactory year.  Empire Day and Arbor Day were both very pleasing.  School Visiting Day on 5 November and its half holiday saw a procession of Guys in the main street.  They were then burnt on a huge bonfire.  This event raised £38.

Following the inspection of the school buildings by the Architect-in-Chief’s Department last year, two 2,000 gallon tanks were installed and the polluted water problem was solved though we still have pigeons and are open to suggestions about how to deal with them.  At last the yard has been asphalted, after being surveyed for it 25 years ago.  A new garden has been laid out and ploughed in the old sale yards.  A new assistant has been appointed since enrolments increased to 250.  The so-called condemned classroom has not yet been renovated because the Department cannot finance it till after 30 June.  We are attempting to finance it locally as a matter of urgency and to be repaid.  St Mary’s Hall has been hired in the meantime, but is not very satisfactory from either the teachers’ of students’ points of view.
