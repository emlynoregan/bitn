Fire.  On Thursday morning a fire broke out in a galvanised iron kitchen and washhouse at the rear of J.T. Walker’s house in Chapel St.  Flames licked the house eaves and on the other side was a store of chaff and firewood.  With the aid of a garden hose the fire was extinguished and damage was confined to the room.
