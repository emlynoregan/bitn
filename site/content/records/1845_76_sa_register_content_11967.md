Kooringa News, 6 October

The German Choral Society gave a concert in the large room at the Burra Hotel on Monday last, to which they invited the principal residents.  A strong following attended. They were assisted by Messrs Chapman & Ware, who sang a duet, and by Messrs Siekemann & Chapman who sang several songs.  A ball followed the concert.

There was a Wesleyan Bazaar in the schoolroom on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday to aid trust funds.  There was a great variety of fancy work, engravings, clothing and every type of farm produce.  The first day raised almost £200 and the three days £382, since when several lots have been sold to bring the total to over £400.

On Thursday night there was a lecture in the chapel by Rev. Colwell on The Intellectual Progress of Our Race.  About 400 attended.  The lecture lasted for about three hours.

Today there was excitement at the arrival of several specimens from the section recently leased by Messrs Bath and Bosance.  They are splendid examples of copper ore.  A stone seven feet from the surface was broken by Captain Killicoat and assayed by Mr A. Thomas of Kooringa.  It gave a produce of 55%.

Mr Thomas Rosewall has been appointed Captain at the Royal Mining Co.’s mine at Karkulto.  This is a wise appointment as he has been working on the ground for a long time and knows the place better than anyone.
