Editorial on The Burra Mine

Shareholders are asking what is being done.  Two attempts have been made to get the directors to get some tangible work done, but things are virtually at a standstill.  In the last balance-sheet the directors said the mine was under offer to a London company, but we believe this is not so.  If true it seems strange that they are also negotiating with the SA Government for the loan of a pump to unwater the mine.  We think neither work nor pumping is likely for some time to come.  Nothing can really be done without the company being refloated, there being so little capital available to the directors.  Both the shareholders and the public are disappointed at the lack of development.  As a last resort the directors could place the reserve shares on the market at 10/- and allow those shares on which 10/- has been paid to be declared fully paid.  This would raise Â£20,000.
