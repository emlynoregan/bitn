Pearce’s Building Fire.  Our first report suggested a 10 minute delay before the siren blew, but we have now found only three or four minutes elapsed and in that time all the firemen had been notified.  Only eight minutes elapsed before the first hose was secured to the plug in front of Pascoe’s shop.  The new mains provided wonderful pressure.
