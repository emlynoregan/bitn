A public meeting was called by H.J.B. Jennison, Vice-President of the old Burra Progress Assoc., for 28 May in an effort to re-form the Association.  The Mayor had written to him expressing his belief that such an Association could be of great assistance to the town and Council.  The old Association ceased to function at the end of 1939, with the outbreak of the War.  The late F.T. Sara was then President.  The Association could assist in the re-opening of the Burra Mine, better town and district roads, town amenities like parks and gardens, better rail and telephone facilities, assisting visitors, fostering youth activities and creating civic mindedness.  A lime kiln and brick manufacture could both be profitable in the district.  [The next issue indicated that the last AGM of the old association was held in August 1941.]
