Excavations at the White Hart Hotel Site

Archaeologist Parry Kostiglou has been investigating the site of the White Hart Hotel, built in the 1850s and destroyed by fire in 1916.  He is working for the Burra National Trust on a project initiated by them and David Bannear to rescue archaeological evidence.  The Highways Department is building the Ludgvan Street Deviation between the Broken Hill and Morgan Roads, which necessitates the demolition of the old Bushman’s Home Hotel (Fridd’s House), the shelter shed of the Croquet Club and also passes over the site of the White Hart Hotel.  The Highways Department granted permission to carry out the rescue project before the roadway was laid and they have agreed to refund part of the cost if the report meets with Heritage Branch approval.  Consequently much dirt has been moved around in the last fortnight and Parry returns this week to finish the work.
