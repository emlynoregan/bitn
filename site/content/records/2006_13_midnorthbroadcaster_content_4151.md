Burra Quilters met at Booborowie Hall on Wednesday to stitch two quilts to be donated to the Burra Hospital and a local charity.  Twenty-two members attended.  Nine people sewed while two cut material and two ironed the pieces of fabric.  The quilts require some more work and will be completed over the next few meetings.
