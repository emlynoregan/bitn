Redruth Court, 16 April.

William Develaing was fined £1 + £1-8-0 costs for not complying with a Local Board of Health order to clean the urinal and closet at the rear of the Exchange Hotel, the bench agreeing that limewash and a small ventilator was an inadequate response.

Mr Duff was fined 10/- for driving at 11-12 m.p.h. through Best Place.
