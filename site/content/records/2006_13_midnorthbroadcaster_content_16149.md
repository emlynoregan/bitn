An anonymous writer also writes re Evan, describing him as one of life’s characters.  Evan liked to think, to philosophise and to explore those ideas through poetry, paintings and sculptures.  He had a great memory for connections between people and was a very generous person who contributed greatly to a number of Burra’s volunteer groups.  He will be greatly missed at the Burra Art Group gatherings, at the Burra Regional Art Gallery and at the Men’s Shed.
