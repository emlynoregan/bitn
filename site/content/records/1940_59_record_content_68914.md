Obituary.  Mrs Helen Rowe, who died at Burra Hospital on 7 July, was born at Princess Town, two miles west of Burra on 28 November 1876.  She was the daughter of the late William and Mary Owers.  In her youth she worked at the Farrell Flat Hotel and the Bon accord Hotel in Burra.  Later she went to Mutooroo Station as nurse maid to Ross and Keith Smith who later were the first to fly from England to Australia and who were knighted for their efforts.  While at Mutooroo she met her late husband Mr John Rowe whom she married in 1904.  From there she went with her husband to Alderman Station and then to Sturt Vale, where they lived for four years.  After that they went to Kangaroo Island for employment and returned to take up residence at Hampton (Burra North).  In the years that followed Mrs Rowe became noted for her catering for Burra Shows and other functions.  She in fact catered for the first Burrs Show held on the new grounds in 1925.  She was a very active worker till a few weeks before her death.  Six children survive: Dorothy Mrs E.L. Scroops (Plympton), Jack & Alf (Burra), Flora Mrs Scriven (Ferryden Park) and Fan Mrs Ken Griffen (Brayville).  Two children, Basil & Iris, predeceased her.

[Born Ellen Owers 28 November 1877 Belalie.  Married and died as Helen.]
