Burra Hospital.  The Red Cross Society, Adelaide, has offered Â£150 towards the cost of the proposed X-ray plant and the offer has been accepted with thanks.  The Red Cross offer represents a response to war-time contributions from the district.

The Inspector-General of Hospitals writes he would be glad to take steps to bring Burra Hospital in line with other subsidised hospitals.  He will be advised the Board is giving the matter consideration and an early reply will be sent.
