Kooringa News, 13 March

Yesterday the anniversary of the Burra Burra Lodge MUIOOF was celebrated with a dinner at the Burra Hotel.  A company of about 80 sat down to an excellent repast at about 6 p.m.  Mr MacDermott SM occupied the chair, with P.G. Corey in the Vice-Chair.  Toasts are reported involving, Mr Beale, P.G. Dawson, P.G. Pearce, V.G. Snell, P.S. Dennis, Mr Ledan, N.G. Sampson, Bro. James Pearce, Bro. Baker, P.G. Kent, Bro Drake & Mr Lee.  The Burra Burra Lodge had 275 members on the books.

[Note that the initials used above refer to positions in the lodge and not to given names.]

The mail remains unsatisfactory.  On Monday it broke down on the road about 25 miles from Kooringa and the mail had to be brought in on horseback.  Today the mail-driver was fined for working horses with sore shoulders.
