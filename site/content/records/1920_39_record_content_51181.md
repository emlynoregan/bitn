The Booborowie Correspondent explains at some length why people there are opposed to Council amalgamation.

There are tentative proposals to annex Anne Ward to Terowie and to form a new Council by amalgamating Ayers Ward with Hanson, Mt Bryan and Burra DCs.  Ayers Ward became a DC in 1875, but little progress was made until c. 1910 owing to the paralysing tendency that large holdings had on progress.  Anne Ward was added in 1888 when neither Hallett not Mt Bryan wanted it.

In 1909 the assessment for Ayers was £9,000 and for Anne £5,885 for a rate income of £522 from 131 assessments.

In 1929 the assessment for Ayers was £33, 199 and for Anne £18,328 for a rate income of £3,429-4-0 from 353 assessments.

This change was largely due to closer settlement.

Merging Booborowie district with other low priced districts will stop the progress of Booborowie in the same way the large estates did in the past.  Not so long ago there was a yearly contract to destroy rabbits in the [unoccupied] area of the town.  Now there are 3 churches, a hall, a hotel, 3 stores, a bank, a post office, continuous telephone service, a motor garage, a blacksmith & saddler, a butcher, a baker, a school, stock sale yards, tennis courts, a cricket pitch and football, golf & croquet grounds.  In other parts of the district there are 2 churches, a hall, 4 schools, a post office, a cemetery and football, gold & tennis grounds.  The roads compare favourably with those in similar districts.  Mr Melrose might be right in asserting that the merging of Councils will not mean the destruction of small towns, but it will certainly stop any appreciable progress.  The Council is one of the largest customers in the town and its location has a great impact on the town’s progress.
