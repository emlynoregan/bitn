Kooringa News, 25 May

The 24 May was kept here as a holiday on account of the Queenâ€™s Birthday.  All the shops were shut and very little other business was done.  A cricket match was played and participants were so well pleased that they have decided on a Whit Monday game between Miners and Tradespeople.

Weather.  Several fine days have produced grass, but it is now very cold and more rain threatens.

The mails have been late recently.  The trouble appears to lie between Gawler and Kapunda.

The far northern country seems likely to be taken up soon.  A party with a surveyor has passed through here on their way there.

Mr Selwyn is expected to pass through on his way north.  He may find some gold, but no coal.

Clare people appear to think they will have the selecting of our three members again at the next election, but they are mistaken; no nominee of Clare will go down at the Burra after the late exhibitions.
