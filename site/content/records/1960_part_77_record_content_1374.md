Burra Wool Pavilion.  About 20 men turned up for the working bee.  The carpenter had set up the screeds and all was ready.  Brian Riggs and his gang of workers set to the task with three mixers and poured 100 yards of 4 inch concrete in fewer than three hours.  Plasterer ‘Jimmie’ James lay the topping.

[Volunteers are listed; including R. Fuss.]
