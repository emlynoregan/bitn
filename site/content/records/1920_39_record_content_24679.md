St Joseph’s Convent additions were blessed and opened by Rt Rev. Dr A. Killian on 30 October.

The original convent was built over 50 years ago and comprised the schoolroom and four small rooms, one of which was used as a music room for students.  This left three rooms for three nuns’ accommodation.  Rev. Nesdale saw this as unsatisfactory and permission was obtained from the head of the Diocese to enlarge the building.  The additions are two nice lofty rooms built on the south side of the old building.  One is a community room 14ft x 18ft with windows giving a beautiful view of Kooringa.  The other is a dormitory 14ft x 17ft with two windows facing south and one facing west.  A passage 37ft x 3ft connects this to the old building and at the end adjoining the dormitory is a bathroom and lavatory.  The floors are polished jarrah.  The exterior of the convent has been replastered, pointed and painted and necessary internal repairs have been done.

Bishop Killian celebrated Mass at 10.30 a.m.  At noon the congregation moved to the convent where the Bishop blessed the new wing and the public inspected the building.  The contractors were T.H. Woollacott and F.M. Pearce.  Of the total cost of £641-7-6 already £296-4-1 has been raised and the appeal on Sunday added about £180 to this.

Mr & Mrs D.E. Williams were tendered a farewell social at Leighton Hall on 29 October.  Mr Williams was a pioneer of the district and had been a teamster travelling to and from the Barrier.  He settled first at Thistlebeds before coming to Ironmine where he had lived for 37 years.  He had been a committeeman for the Leighton hall and the Burra Show, where he was also a steward.  Mr Williams received a gold watch and chain and Mrs Williams a silver entrée dish.
