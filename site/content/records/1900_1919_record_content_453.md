Boer War.  News of the relief of Kimberley spread on Saturday morning and the town was soon decked in flags.  There was a public meeting in Market Square presided over by the Mayor with patriotic speeches and thanks to God for the deliverance.

The first SA death in the war was noted: a young man from Mt Gambier.

Patriotic songs were sung.  J.E.H. Winnall sang The Englishman.

W.B. Page sang Old England and the New.

Robert Warner sang Three Cheers for the Red, White and Blue.

The Nurses Fund gained Â£3-10-0 from a collection and the meeting ended with the National Anthem and Rule Britannia.

Similar outbursts of patriotic fervour are noted from Adelaide and elsewhere.
