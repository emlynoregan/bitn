Obituary.  One evening a miner of some property, who was doing well, but was a heavy drinker, committed suicide one day last week.  On the night in question he left his own hut in a state of delirium tremens and sought shelter in the Police Station.  The police gave him shelter and watched over him until they thought him all right, and dozed off to sleep.  The miserable man watched for his opportunity and got hold of a razor.  He cut his throat half through.  In the morning the room presented a horrible spectacle, with the corpse enveloped in a mass of gore.

[Strangely, given the circumstances, no death matching these circumstances is recorded on the SA Deaths CD.]
