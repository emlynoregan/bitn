Burra Hospital.  It is reported that the main portion of the hospital has been partially condemned and the Government will take steps to put up another building.  The old building has certainly done service, having been built as the Burra Hotel and it is known that the walls are getting unsafe.  The Council has recently taken steps to see that the Mayor has a seat on the Board, which is only right as the Council are the trustees of the place.
