Burra Show.  Last week’s committee meeting decided the show would go into recess for 2015.  This follows difficulty in finding a person to undertake the vital position of secretary.  It is now too late to induct a person into the many tasks this role involves.  The society has been going on with a small committee and with little success in adding to it over recent years.  Last week five new members were welcomed and these young members have agreed to start planning for the 2016 show, with new ideas and tasks.  It is expected that the show will return in 2016, equal or better than in 2014.
