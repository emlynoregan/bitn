Victorian Gold

The market fluctuated this week.  It began at £2-18-0 per oz, and rose slowly to £3-0-6 before closing at £3.

The Forest Creek Diggings seem still the most productive.  Five Adelaide miners returned to town this week, having realized no less than 250 lb, valued at £9,000 at the week’s closing price.  Some of them intend returning to England with their gold, considering they have made their fortune.  There is considerable gold in town in the hands of diggers.  Some are holding on to it, expecting its price to rise.  Others are disposing of it to meet their current needs.

From the opening of the Victorian goldfields to date 220,305 oz have been shipped from Melbourne and Geelong, valued at £660,915.

[The article goes on to report that robberies and crimes of violence are numerous.  Two murders are detailed.  Details of shipping are also given.]
