Burra Community School students and Robertstown Primary School students have been learning about the World’s End gorge Biodiversity Project.  This aims to protect river red gums, the diverse native understorey and the aquatic habitats in the World’s End section of the Burra Creek Gorge.  The project involves monitoring the environment as well as restoring damage done by off-road vehicles and uncontrolled erosion.  The project is funded by a Native Vegetation Council grant.  The students will visit again in July.
