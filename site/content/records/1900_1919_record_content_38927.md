Burra Contingent Farewell.

Those most closely connected with the Light Horse decided on a dinner for the men and their friends before the public meeting.  This was provided in the Skating Rink and c. 100 were present.  E.W. Crewes presided at about an hourâ€™s notice and made a suitable speech.  Hon. J. Lewis MLC was present (though he did not now live in Burra, he had done so for many years) and he made a speech which included an appeal for understanding and support for Australians of German background.  Other speeches were made by Rev. J.H. Nield, Lieut. Lewis, Lieut. Copley and Mr E. Cock.
