Burra News, 18 December

Henry Bromley and Richard Webb have been committed for trial charged with stealing a purse containing 3/- and two promissory notes – one for £230 and the other for £70 from a German named George Wartmann.  Fortunately they would not have been able to obtain payment of the notes under any circumstances.

The Bible Christian Mutual Improvement Association held an inaugural meeting in the schoolroom last week.  Rev. Thomas Allen was chairman.  A pleasant evening was spent and £6 was collected.  It will go to the library fund.

Redruth Wesleyan Chapel held its Anniversary last Sunday.  Rev. Greer of Auburn officiated.  The collection reduced the debt to £100.  On Tuesday Mr Greer addressed the Wesleyan Mutual Improvement Association.

Bushfires are presently reported from Anama, Bungaree and Woorkoongoree Runs.

Many miners are leaving for Wallaroo.
