Oddfellows Lodge Social at the Institute was presided over by Dr J.I. Sangster, to acknowledge the work of W. Davey over many years.  Over forty people attended.  The evening began with an excellent spread followed by the usual speeches interspersed with music and songs.  Mr Davey has been connected with the lodge for the past forty years.  He was presented with a purse of sovereigns.  In replying he gave an outline of the origins of Oddfellowship in London in 1710, though the Manchester Unity Lodge only came along in 1809.  The Burra Burra Lodge was formed in 1849 and has a membership of 293 and funds of £5,349.  In the quarter ending May last £145 was paid as sick pay (Representing £2 per day to 40 members.)  [This would seem to be saying that members got 1/- a day sick pay.]

Mr Davey joined the lodge on 3 August 1859 and became secretary in 1869, resigning after 9½ years.  He had also been an auditor for 12 years and a trustee for 7.  Mr S. Burns represented the Rechabites, Mr Davis the Freemasons and Mr Shortridge the Foresters.
