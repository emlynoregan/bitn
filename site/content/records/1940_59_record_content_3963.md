Burra town Council, 18 November.

The Department of Mines replied to Mr McDonaldâ€™s query re further employment at the Burra Mine, saying that it was at present merely trying to find out if the ore available could be smelted at Pt Pirie.

The Unemployment Relief Council wrote re Special Xmas Cheer Fund for unemployed persons.  Council was asked to subsidise the scheme if possible.  Cr Lott felt as not many would be eligible they might be able to do so.

The Mayor said 17 families had left the town recently and this together with enlistments was making it hard for business.  He was anxious to get more men employed at the mine.

Cr Terry said more could not be employed at present.

Cr Samuel said they were fortunate to be having it tested at all.  Mines elsewhere were receiving no attention.

Cr March said when the Premier & Minister of Mines visited the Council had no proof the mine was worth working.  (The Mayor disagreed.) The men working there now had been told to test a certain shaft and he did not see why the Council should interfere now.

The Mayor said the Federal Govt. should be approached to see if it was possible to treat the ore from the mine in SA.

Cr Samuel said about 26 mining towns had approached the Govt. about getting their mines going and had got nothing.  Now two experts were testing the Burra Mine.  There was no definite lode at the Burra Mine.
