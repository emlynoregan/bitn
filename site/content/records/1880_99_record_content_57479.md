2nd Leader discusses the New Assessment.

The writer wonders if the Council expects by this means to get more or less income.  Surely the former, as bonds and coupons amounting to £215 will have to be paid this year.  The amount owing on the general account is £645 and the last instalment of £205 is due by July 1897.  It would make no sense to reduce rates for 1896 and then have a special levy in 1897 of double the amount.  He also wonders what sort of job they would get done at the sweatshop rate of £15 as suggested by Cr Hardy.
