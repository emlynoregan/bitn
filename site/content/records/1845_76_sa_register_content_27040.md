The Rabbit Nuisance.  An example of the rabbit problem is cited from the Eudunda area.  W. Davidson came to the area in 1874 and leased some of Mr White’s land for five years.  He planted 17 bags of wheat and as the crop grew it appeared likely to yield 1,000 bushels.  But then the rabbits appeared and he killed 6,000 to 7,000 of them.  In return they ate the crop and he ended up harvesting just 15 bags of grain.  Davidson then gave up and sold the lease back to Mr White for £70.  The Hundreds of Julia Creek, Neales and Apoinga are to be declared Rabbit Districts, but we doubt if the provisions of the Act are sufficient to meet the requirements of the cases.
