Letter from WHH [Hardy] which questions whether we should be so amused at the Russian hoax in Melbourne.  The actions of the Russian Government at home have been brutal and it has a foreign policy that threatens the British Empire in India, so don’t think that a visit to Australia by a Russian Admiral is entirely innocent.
