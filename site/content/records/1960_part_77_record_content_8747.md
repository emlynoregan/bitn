Obituary.  Return Thanks Notice says that Mr & Mrs A. Herewane [though Herrawane in the paper] have had a sad bereavement.  [Could this possibly be the death of Violetta Cassandra May Herawane aged 5, daughter of Mr & Mrs Alexander Herawane of Spalding?  Unfortunately SA Deaths CD gives an appropriate day and month, but the wrong year: 26 October 1962!  The surname is uncommon and no other death suggests itself unless this refers to a relative with a different surname.]
