Catholic Picnic Races were held on 6 March at the Burra Racecourse.  They went off very well.  J. Callary’s horses won the two main races.  In the President’s Handicap R. Hawkes’ Happy Jack ridden by T. Kenny started bucking at the barrier and put on a fine show eventually unseating his rider and delivering a kick to his ribs and another to his chin which rendered him unconscious and placed him in hospital, but he is expected to be himself again in a few days.
