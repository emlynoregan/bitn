Expenditure in 1904		£13-3-4

Credit in hand		4-9½

The anniversary collections	£2-7-10

Tea	£5-13-6

Collection at public meeting	15-6

Supper	£2-1-5

Anniversary total	£10-18-3

Cash in hand after the anniversary		£11-3-0½

Since the debt on the church is £8 and the annual repayment is £4 there is ample money on hand.

[These figures show the financial importance of the anniversary to such churches and it is also clear that much of it came from townsfolk who went out to the outlying churches on such occasions.]
