Burra Hospital Board, 23 July

Mr Hawkes was re-elected Chairman.

There was some discussion on the status of Council representatives who had not formally been re-appointed, but eventually it was decided to proceed.

The Councils had paid during the year £845 and the Government which was supposed to subsidise this 30/- in the £ had paid £472.

Dr Steele wanted the position of responsible medical officer settled and considered the person so designated be paid £50 p.a.  It had been suggested the two doctors sort this out between them, but they had not responded.  The Chairman thought that the hospital was so beneficial to the doctors that no remuneration should be paid.  There was a difference of opinion between the Chairman and Mr Warnes and Mr Melrose.  Mr Melrose said if there were no payment to difficulty might arise that neither doctor would want the appointment.  Discussion was then deferred to the next meeting.
