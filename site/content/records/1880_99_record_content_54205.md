Burra Town Council

There was some discussion about employing a lad named Daniels who was in poor circumstances.  He had been employed at the quarry for 2/6 a day and later by Cr Harris for 3/- a day.  Cr Parks said we will give him 5/- a day, but Cr Linkson wondered why he was suddenly worth more.  Cr Harris said he had ‘growed’ since he had employed him.

Cr Sampson congratulated the Town Clerk on his ability to get in the rates.

There was a report from Cr Parks that Mr Rogers’s kerbing in Redruth was not up to specifications and he should not be paid until it was.

Cr West had seen it and agreed.

Cr Sampson agreed that it needed to be re-laid.

The Mayor agreed with the judgements of the others.

There was a somewhat heated exchange over a shortage in the metal that had been paid for near the Recreation Ground.

There was a long and quite acrimonious discussion about the Waterworks Engineer, but the actual issue in contention is not stated.
