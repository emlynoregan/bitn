Entertainment.  The Lady of Carthage will be presented at the Institute in costume tonight.  It is the story of the Martyrdom of SS Vivia Perpetua and Felicitas.  Proceeds are for a worthy object.  [Both the worthy object and the producers of the effort are unnamed here, but an advertisement elsewhere on page 3 says the profits will go to St Mary’s Sunday school.]
