Kooringa Church was filled to capacity on Sunday for three services of celebration.  The ladies of the Guild decorated the building with flowers.  Many old members of the church travelled from afar for the occasion.  Mr & Mrs Clem Sampson came from WA and Mr E.C. Gould also came from there.  He had not been in Burra for 44 years.  Unfortunately Miss Gert Pearce was too ill to attend.  She had been the organist and Sunday school secretary for many years.  Preacher for the day was the President of Conference Rev. A.D. McCutcheon and Rev. J.P.H. Tilbrook, a former popular minister of the Kooringa Circuit was also present.  Todd Street Gawler Choir was present at each service under the baton of Mr E. Goodger.
