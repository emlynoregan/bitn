‘A Lover of Fair Play’ writes re the Corporation not supporting moves by the North Ward Councillors to get Council control of the Aberdeen Reserve by making it a town rather than a ward matter.  The writer alleges it was a matter of about 6d in stamps to send a protest to the offending parties.  He considers the paper should be renamed The Kooringa Advocate and North Ward Detractor.  The Recreation Ground is indeed a White Elephant situated in Middle Ward such that the elderly cannot walk to it without being utterly prostrated.  And to assert that it is centrally located is stretching ones imagination too far.  Also why are all cases of drunkenness in Kooringa duly chronicled under Magistrates Court Kooringa while no such cases are reported from Redruth?  North Ward was forced into borrowing money to enclose the Recreation Ground by votes from the other wards.  It could have been a success had it been located about where the brewery is.  Is it not a fact that the reason the Aberdeen [water] scheme was not at first accepted was because the water would come from North Ward?  And when it was seen it could be got no other way was it not accepted with very bad grace?
