Obituary.  Stanley Kellaway died at Burra Hospital on Monday 13 August.  Over many years he had taken a prominent role in most things to do with the welfare and betterment of the town.  He was born in Burra on 11 August 1885 and lived all his life in the town.  Although he received only three and a half years’ education at Burra Primary School, the citizens placed him in the highest positions, including that of Mayor.  He began his working life as a tributer in the old Burra Mine.  When that became unprofitable he took on a wheat-buying and insurance agency from the SA Farmers’ Union and worked at it for 41 years until his death.  Forty years ago he married Olive Short at Peterborough and they had six sons: Tom, Stan, Clarence (deceased,) Clyde, Ken and Charlie.  Tom and Clyde are in Adelaide, Charlie is at Peterborough and Ken and Stan live in Burra.  There are eleven grandchildren.  He took a great interest in civic affairs and was first elected to Burra Town Council when about 28 years old.*  He served the Council for 27* years, serving through two World Wars* as well as being Mayor 1938-39.*  During his time in Council he served on many committees and deputations to the Government.  For much of this time he was Chairman of the Public Works Committee and a Member of the Burra Hospital Board.   For many years he was a JP and sometimes acted as the Local Coroner.  Mr Kellaway was an active member of the Kooringa Methodist Church, where he served terms as Church Steward and Trustee.  He also served on the Burra Primary School Committee, some of the time as Chairman.  He was also on the High School Council and in the Fathers’ Association.  In both World Wars he served on numerous Patriotic Committees and during bad times saw that pensioners got comforts they would not otherwise have received.  In his youth he was a prominent footballer and when he grew too old to play became an umpire, with a reputation for impartiality.  He encouraged his sons in the sport and both Tom and Clyde played in the SANFL.  For approximately the last twenty years he was prominent in the Burra Bowling Club and was at one time the President.  [Born 11 April 1885 Kooringa: died 13 August 1951 Burra.]
