Department of Environment & Heritage District Ranger Ian Falkenberg said it was hoped to establish commercial tourism at the site with properly trained community members involved in guiding and tourism.  Accredited training would have to be undertaken.  It is also hoped to improve the current fossil display in the Council Foyer and to find a large home for it.
