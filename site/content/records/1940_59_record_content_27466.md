Advt.  H.J.B. Jennison

As from Monday 15 July control has been lifted on the sale of all motor car and truck tubes (not tyres).  I have placed heavy orders and have been advised a large part of my order will be delivered during the week.

[The advertisement includes a good photograph of Jennisonâ€™s re-treading plant.]
