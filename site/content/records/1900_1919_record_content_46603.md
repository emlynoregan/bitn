Burra Show Soc. has decided to get quotes for a luncheon booth – an unlined galvanised iron shed either 60’ x 30’ x 14’ or 60’ x 30’ x 12’ with a 7’ roof without a floor.  The agreement with the Recreation Ground Syndicate has expired and a new agreement is needed to acquire security of tenure.  Up to now use has been free, but all permanent buildings become the property of the Syndicate.  The Syndicate’s view of the proposed building will be sought.
