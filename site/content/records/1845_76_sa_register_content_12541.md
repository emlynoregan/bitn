Kooringa News, 3 August

The Burra Benevolent Board called a meeting at the Institute to consider the destitution existing in Burra and the means of addressing it, but so few attended that the meeting was abandoned.  Apart from Rev. Ibbetson the other ministers of the town were too busy with the religious excitement presently existing in the town.

Mr Hudson gave two entertainments at the Burra Hotel last Saturday and Monday, which were but thinly attended considering the superior nature of the treat offered.

On Tuesday a meeting of the inhabitants was held at the Burra Hotel to consider the answer received from the Directors of the SA Mining Association relative to forming a Corporation to improve their township.  The ‘liberal terms’ were that leases would be renewed for 31 years from the expiration of the current leases at an annual rental of half the annual value of the land with the improvements thereon.  It was resolved that they could not entertain the idea of forming a Corporation to tax themselves in order to improve what is the Mining Company’s property, unless far more liberal terms were offered.  A committee was appointed to correspond with the Directors in an attempt to get more liberal terms.  Everyone seems convinced that there is no hope of getting a Corporation formed and are preparing themselves by getting allotments at Redruth and Aberdeen, especially as the railway terminus is expected to be there and consequently all the trade that it will generate.

Wheal Sarah Mine shareholders met on Monday evening and John Dunstan was appointed Captain.
