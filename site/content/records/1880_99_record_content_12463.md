2nd Leader on the apparent inability of the Inspector to abate the goat problem, concluding that at £100 p.a. the Council is not paying enough for a man’s full employment.  Previously he was getting £90, or less than a labourer.  In Adelaide he is paid £160.  Surely ours is worth 50/- a week.  [£130 p.a.]
