Paxton Square.  There is an account of an attempt to recover valuable malachite samples supposedly hidden under the floor of one of the cottages forty years ago.  A large hole was dug in one house and then in its neighbour.  A third hole was dug and though many items of rubbish were found including old sheepâ€™s bones, there was no treasure.
