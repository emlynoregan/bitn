An Amateur Hour was held in the Burra Institute last Wednesday.  It is believed to be the first of its kind held here.  The hall was packed to capacity by 8 p.m.

The President of the Burra Red Cross Unit’s Junior Appeal Mrs D.M. Steele proved indefatigable in organising the event with her secretary Mrs Roy Jeffery and several other members.  The actual program was in the hands of Messrs L. Davis and L. Easson, headmasters of the Burra Primary and High Schools respectively.  Mr Pontifex acted as treasurer.
