Our Gold Fields: the Report of Warden William J. Peterwald.

[There is a report on Echunga, Mt Torrens, Mt Pleasant, Barossa and Ulooloo.]

Ulooloo.  This field has not progressed as I had expected it would.  Nothing new has been found and the principal workings have been confined to the branch creek.  As stated previously, it is difficult to form an accurate impression of the amount of gold raised, but from banks and gold buyers it would seem to be about 4,500 oz from 1 January to 30 October 1872, independent from that raised from private lands.  To get this the population has not averaged over 300 men on Crown lands, giving a return, at the rate of £4 per ounce, of £1-10-0 per man per week.
