On Saturday afternoon a large crowd turned out to see 17-year-old J.A. Stafford of Mt Gambier win the first Adelaide to Burra road race.  A large bunch of cyclists raced towards the finishing line, with V. Wallman in the lead until the last second, when Stafford beat him by half a wheel.  F. Willson of Pt Pirie came third.

While the crowd was waiting for the cyclists from Adelaide, a Ladies Four Mile Wheel Race was held.  The placings in that event were: Miss Pilkington, Miss James and Miss Spooner.  Fastest time was Mrs Jones in 11 minutes.

Winners of the Adelaide-Burra Race:

Fastest time: T. Perry (14 minutes) in 6 hours 20 minutes 59.2 seconds.

The crowd in Market Square was entertained with side shows and competitions.  There was a Darts Competition, Shooting, Rolling the Ball and Lifting the Bottles.
