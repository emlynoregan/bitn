The Air Force Ball was held on Friday evening  in Burra Town Hall.  The decorations were original, humorous and colourful.  A huge silver aeroplane, complete with navigation lights and a realistic pilot was suspended from the ceiling.  There were colourful floral displays, caricatures and patriotic flags and bunting.  The sumptuous supper of poultry and salads and sweets had a suckling pig in pride of place.
