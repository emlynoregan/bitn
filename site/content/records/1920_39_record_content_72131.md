Obituary.  Samuel Baker died at his residence in Redruth at the age of 98 years 5 months on 22 August.  He was born in Adelaide on 17 March 1840 near where Holy Trinity Church stands.  He was the son of John & Hannah Baker who arrived by the Buffalo in 1836 and first lived on North Terrace Adelaide and later on East Terrace.  His father had a butcherâ€™s shop in Hindley St where Samuel worked for a while.  Mr Baker had a long memory of a number of historic events in Adelaide.  He recalled the opening of the first bank on North Terrace in 1845, the arrival of Sir Henry & Lady Young [Governor 1848-54] and the arrival of the first consignment of gold from Victoria under Captain H. Tolmer.  He remembered the Aborigines gathering brandishing spears on the occasion of the opening of the bank.  He recalled also playing on the banks of the Torrens with Harry Wilkins, the father of Sir Hubert Wilkins.  He was baptised at Holy Trinity.  In 1852 he left Adelaide and drove a team of sic bullocks with stores to Burra.  He worked for a butcher named Lenthal whose shop was on the site of the National Bank.  He also worked for the English & Australian Copper Co. and went from them to the Victorian gold diggings, sailing in the French ship Condor to Twofold Bay for the Snowy River Diggings.  After 12 months he returned having been unsuccessful.  He married Miss Ann Edwards at Burra in 1862.  She had arrived with her parents on the Richardson in 1848.  He then carted copper to Port Wakefield, returning with coal; taking over a fortnight for the trip.  In 1860 he started shearing in the Goulburn at a station called Shepherdson, being paid 13-14/- per hundred.  He was a shearer for many years.  In 1887 he went into the pastoral business with his son-in-law the late J.V. Lord at The Pinnacles, Broken Hill, but retained his Redruth home in which he resided until his death for a period of over 76 years.  He was one of the first members of the Burra Show Society and was a keen floriculturalist, and exhibited fine flowers, fruit and vegetables.  He was also a breeder of poultry and game birds.  He was a member of the Redruth Methodist Church for over 60 years.  His mental ability never faded.  His wife died 8 August 1935 at the age of 94 years 7 months.
