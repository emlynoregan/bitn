The SA Murray Darling Basin Natural Resources Management Board was established less than twelve months ago.  It combined a number of previous boards to get an integrated response to the management of natural resources.  It is advised by local Resource Management Groups.  While based in Murray Bridge, the board has an office in Burra.  Members of the board visited Burra and the area last Wednesday.
