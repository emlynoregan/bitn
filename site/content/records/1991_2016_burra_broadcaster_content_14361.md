The local ambulance serves an area from ‘The Gums’ to Hallett in the north and south towards Manoora and west to Booborowie and Spalding, as well as the station country to the east.  National Medals have been awarded to Rosemary Opperman for 15 years’ service and to Brian Thamm for 35 years’ service to the ambulance.
