Editorial on the Mayor’s annual report.

The mayor receives a hearty endorsement for the work done despite the fact that the assessed value of the rateable property in the town has fallen from £15,892 in 1885 to £9,481 this year at a time when loans taken out earlier had come due for repayment.

The bonded debt is now reduced to £1,200 and will disappear in 1897 as now planned.

Despite heavy repair costs the Waterworks account is about in balance.

There were many unclaimed allotments on which no rates have been paid since the town was incorporated in 1876. The Council should move to sell these to recover long overdue monies.

The oval is nearly out of debt - now down to £200.

The frost damage to trees this year is regrettable.

SAMA has presented us with land for the cemetery extension.

The personal dispute in Council earlier in the year is best put behind us.
