The Chrysanthemum Show was the best ever.  Mr Cave did not compete as he had sent his best to the Adelaide Show and was reserving the best of his others for the Wentworth Show, but he sent an excellent collection not for competition.

Mr R. M. Harvey did very well, winning 10 firsts and 1 second from 11 entries.

Dr Brummitt got 4 firsts, 8 seconds and 6 thirds.

M.W. Lasscock got 5 firsts, 4 seconds and 1 third.

J. Lewis got 6 firsts, and 3 thirds.

W. Davey won best of its kind for a pot specimen.

In the evening the Burra Band played in front of the Institute and inside a promenade concert provided by a group of ladies accompanied the show.

A full list of winners is printed.
