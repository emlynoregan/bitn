Burra Cycling Classic was held over the weekend of 12-13 September.  The main race was on Saturday over 125 km and on Sunday a series of scratch events were held from Leighton Cricket club to Mt Bryan and back.  John Stafford, who won the event in 1948 (aged 17) started the Saturday race.  In 1948 it started in King William Street, Adelaide, by the City Baths and finished in Burra, 120 miles later, having criss-crossed the country through Kapunda, Marrabel and Clare.  One of John’s riding mates, John McIntosh (‘Blue’) was also in Burra for the weekend.  The three big races of the time were Burra to Adelaide, the Mt Gambier 100 and the Warrnambool to Melbourne.  Other local names of that time were Sid and Eric Scroop, Donny Kerin, Rex Opperman and the two Garrard boys.  [Photo of John with Don Lloyd.]
