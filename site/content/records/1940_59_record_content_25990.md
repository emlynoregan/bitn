BHS Students Visit Adelaide

Last Friday 68 of the school students caught the 6.55 a.m. train to Adelaide.  Mr Hanlin ran the school bus two hours early to gather in outlying students.  Only three students were unable to go.  The ‘News’ sent a photographer and reporter to the Adelaide Railway Station to meet the party.  They then split into three groups:

To the Rosella factory.

To the Amscoll Factory and the Fire Brigade.

A group of boys went to the Adelaide Joinery and Wiles’ Chromium Plating Works.

At about 1 p.m. the three groups met at the Botanic Park for lunch.  A fine misty rain did not prevent a walk through dahlia beds and along the Torrens to the Art Gallery via the University Grounds.  After an hour there they went to Parliament House for a tour conducted by the Hon. A.P. Blesing.  At 5 p.m. the students had a brief time to visit Rundle Street shops before returning to the Adelaide Railway Station.
