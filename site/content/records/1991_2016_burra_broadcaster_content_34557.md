Letter from Sean Boyle of Prospect, thanking all for their help and concern following his accident at the Burra Cycling Classic.  He spent Saturday night at Clare Hospital and was then in high dependency in the Women’s & Children’s Hospital until Wednesday afternoon, when his chest tube was removed.  Then there were two days in a surgical ward before being able to go home.
