Burra Town Council 21 July

Cr Hammond pointed out that before appointing a new permanent hand, as they did last meeting, they should have advertised the position 5 days before.

The Mayor said Violet Day fell on 3 August and it was decided to discuss the matter with the religious bodies.

Council, with some apparent reluctance, agreed to lease the land sought to the Kooringa Tennis Club.  Cr Harris sought unsuccessfully to have a no play on Sundays clause inserted into the lease.

Cr Riggs opposed the lease as he said Council could ill afford to lose the grazing land.

The matter of a new ambulance was left with the Mayor and Town Clerk to convene a meeting.
