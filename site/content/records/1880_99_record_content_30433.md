Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting.

The Mayor’s Report:

The year started with an overdraft of £237-3-3.  A £200 bond was due and redeemed on 1 April.  A police moiety of £45-9-1 was demanded.

Interest on bonds amounted to £108 plus £58 costs from the Waterworks.

This meant that £648-12-4 was accounted for before any ordinary expenditure.

A Government subsidy was available only until 30 June at 25% of outlay to that date.

The police charges will cease at the end of this year and the Council will get licence fees.  [This apparently meant the licensed victuallers’ fees and the Mayor expected some of the auctioneers’ licence fees too, but he seemed unclear about those.]

For 1889-93 bonds worth £300 fall due each year and should be redeemed.

The Mayor then outlines again the Waterworks debacle and says that no response to the latest deputation has yet been received.

The good health record of the town in the past two years was marred this year by a mystery disease [which claimed several lives].

Tree planting continued to fill in the gaps.

The cemetery debt had been reduced to £9 from £30-9-9 at the start of the year.  This was possible by using the curator for public works when not required at the cemetery and it should allow the debt to be eliminated next year.
