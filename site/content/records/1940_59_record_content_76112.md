Accident.  An Ampol petrol tanker driven by Mr R. Nunn of Adelaide rolled over shortly after passing over the railway crossing at Yarcowie on Tuesday.  The driver was only shaken, but damage to the vehicle was about Â£1,650.  Petrol leaking from the valves was taken by passing motorists and two mobile cranes came from Adelaide and righted the vehicle by midday Wednesday.
