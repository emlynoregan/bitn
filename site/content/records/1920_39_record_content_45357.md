Obituary.  Mr William Neville died in Adelaide last week.  For many years he had kept the Royal Exchange Hotel in Aberdeen [1891-98] and most of his family were born there.  He was aged 74.  He is survived by his widow born Miss Annie Gentle. [This was corrected in the next issue on 22 March to: born Miss Annie Syme.]  [William George Neville died 9 March 1933 at Prospect.  The above is misleading in that he was at the Court House Hotel 1884-1890 and his children were born between 1884 and 1901: the first three at Redruth and the last two at Aberdeen, so most were born while he was running the Court House Hotel.  He was a Burra Town Councillor 1903-07.]
