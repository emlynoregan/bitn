Burra in the Early 1850s

A recent visitor once lived in the first dwelling built in Kooringa.  He expressed surprise at the pleasing improvements in the town.  He said he arrived in Adelaide on Tuesday 29 July 1851 to find there was not the demand for workers they had been told existed.  A great number of those who came with him went to the Victorian goldfields.  The miners took houses in Adelaide for their wives and families and headed for Burra.  Those who could afford it rode, but many had to walk.  There were many unfamiliar sights along the way: parrots, cockatoos, trees that shed their bark rather than their leaves, trees that rotted from the inside first, trees with bark ½ to ¾ inch thick.  A man who could afford the £400 to £500 to take land generally did well.  Of those tradesmen who started business only about one in twenty succeeded.  At the Burra Mines many of the workers had been shoemakers, tailers etc. and they found the toil there very hard on them.  Burra was a barren and desolate place with very little land in cultivation.  Large gatherings of natives could be seen wherever water was handy.  They were very quiet and did not interfere if left alone.  They came to the whites for ‘tuckout’ and were glad of any discarded clothing, a little food and ‘bacca’.  Miners were getting c. 30/- a week, blacksmiths 39/-, carpenters 7/- a day and shoemakers 7/6.  Food was very dear, but got cheaper as time went by.  Flour was 18/- a cwt and per pound beef was 2d, mutton 2d, sugar 4½d, figs 6d, currants 7d, butter up to 2/-, tea 2/-, apples 1/6, pork 10d, soap 4½d, soda 3½d, salt 3d, tobacco 6/6 to 8/-, coffee 1/6 and eggs were up to 2/- a dozen.  The town is heaven now to what it was then.
