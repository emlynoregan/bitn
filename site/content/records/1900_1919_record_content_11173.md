New Stock Yards.  For many years Bagot, Shakes & Lewis have held their monthly sales in the yards adjoining the Burra Hotel, selling cattle horses and the like there and selling sheep at the yards near the old Unicorn Brewery.  Having two yards together is an obvious advantage and the firm recently decided to build new yards near the sheep yards for cattle etc.  Messrs Baker & T. & W. Rosewall won the contract and have done a first class job.  There are 20 yards 18ft x 14ft with a 5ft gate in each with two races from the open yard up to the auctioneer’s box.  The stock will be driven in the lower gate fronting Paxton Square and drafted into the pens made of 4” diameter mallee rails with posts 12” x 12” and topped with white peppermint rails.  The pens are on a slight slope for drainage.  The selling yard is enclosed in a wall and covered with timber and iron.  The carpentry was by George Bartholomaeus and the ironwork by W. Henderson.  The first sale in the new yards will be held next Friday.
