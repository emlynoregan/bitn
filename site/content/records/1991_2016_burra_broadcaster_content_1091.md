Governor Dame Roma Mitchell was in Burra to officially declare Burra a State Heritage Location.  Burra Traders’ Association presented the traditional Australia Day Breakfast at 8 a.m.  It was well attended despite the hot weather.  This year’s Citizen of the Year awards went to Colleen Spackman and Martin Heath.  After the breakfast attention moved to the Rotunda where deputy Town Clerk John Brak introduced the speakers, including Ian Auhl and the Governor.
