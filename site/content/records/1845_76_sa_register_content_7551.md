Following the removal of Mr Lang from Kooringa the administration of justice had not been more promptly or intelligibly administered.

The police detachment lacks the control he exercised over it and the Court shows an infirmity of purpose, which damages confidence in their judgements and the respect for the law they so hesitatingly administer.

The clearing of the court while the Magistrates discuss in private suggests to the suitors that the Magistrates themselves have serious misgivings as to the extent of their legal knowledge.

[The writer then outlines a situation where Sergeant-Major McCulloch on one day laid an information against a publican claiming it was as the result of repeated problems and on the next court day seeking to withdraw it because he had no wish to press a charge against Mr Taylor who normally conducted his house in an orderly manner.  In other words he was virtually admitting that the original information was laid under false pretences.  Clearly on either one or both occasions there was evidence of tampering with justice, yet their Worships ‘were content to become the tools of a crafty constable who, in all probability, laid the information to prove his power or to assert his consequence.’

[The writer than reports a case where a prisoner was so laxly supervised that he could leave his place of confinement and almost manage to commit a serious assault on a female before a sleepy policeman-gaoler came to the rescue.  The prisoner was committed for trial, but the Magistrates did not even censure the Sergeant-Major for the lax discipline maintained among those under his control.]

‘It will be well for the sake of law and order when a competent Resident Magistrate is appointed for Kooringa and the adjacent districts.’
