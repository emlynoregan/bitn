Obituary.  Brian Alfred Riggs DFC

Brian was born 13 January 1921 at his parents’ home at Burra North near the Railway Station.  His parents were Alfred & Myrtle Riggs.  Just before Brian started school, the family moved to their new home ‘Kabymur’ a Californian bungalow on Smelts Road, where he lived on and off for the rest of his life.  Brian attended Burra Primary School and Burra High School, where he obtained his Intermediate Certificate.  He then went to Prince Alfred College for 1936-38.  He repeated his Leaving year because he felt he had not done himself justice.  He easily duxed the school the second year and won the Samuel Churchwood Scholarship at the end of 1937.  He was School House Prefect in 1938.  Brian then returned to Burra to join his father and become a grazier.  The Mt Bryan property was bought.  He played tennis at Aberdeen and some football at Burra before war intervened.  Brian volunteered in 1941 and joined the RAAF.  He trained at Mt Breckon Victor Harbor, Parafield and Point Cook, Victoria.  He flew twenty-eight bombing raids over Europe until April 1943.  On his first trip as Captain, to Frankfurt, the back of his plane was badly shot up and he lost his rear gunner.  The rudder and electric circuits were ruined and they couldn’t get rid of their bombs.  They limped back and landed with a full bomb load.  Brian never lost another crew member even though his plane was often badly damaged.  In April 1944 he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross by King George VI at Buckingham Palace.

After the war Brian married Lucy Eleanor Rosewarne in 1948 and they went to live at Murkaby.  They had four children: Richard Brian, David Russell, Geoffrey Kym and Jillian Margaret.  Like his father, Brian was heavily involved in community affairs.  He was a committee member, President and Life Member of the Show Society, Councillor and Deputy Chairman of the Burra Burra District Council, RSL Past President and current Treasurer, a JP, Past Master of Kooringa Masonic Lodge, a Member of the Grand Lodge, Member of the Royal Agricultural Society, Merino Sheep Steward at the Royal Adelaide Show, Eastern Zone Representative of the Stockowners’ Association and a Member, Club Champion and Life Member of the Burra Bowling Club.

Vale Brian Alfred Riggs.
