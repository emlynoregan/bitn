Kooringa News, 30 November

The periodical examination and tea-feast at Mr A. Motleyâ€™s school, Redruth, took place today.  The shortness of notice prevented many visitors who would otherwise have attended and the attendance of scholars was not very full.  About 45 scholars were examined in reading, orthography, writing, geography etc. and on the whole the examinations passed off pretty well.  The same evil of irregular attendance was complained of here as it is universally.  Prizes were distributed to the most diligent students and the event concluded with tea and cakes.

A understand that a lode of copper has been struck at last at the Bon Accord Mine, but its extent and value has yet to be ascertained.  The company deserves encouragement for the large amount of capital expended on improvements alone, with as yet trifling returns.

The weather continues very warm with annoying dust storms.  A violent dust storm this evening was followed by a few drops of rain.
