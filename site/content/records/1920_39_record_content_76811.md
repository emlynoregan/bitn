Burra Burra Show 1939

President I.J. Warnes gave a donation of 125 guineas to commemorate 25 years as President of the society.  100guineas of it will reduce the overdraft and 25 guineas will buy a permanent trophy.

The side-show operators were asked for more ground rent than for previous years and they refused to show under those conditions and threatened to declare the Burra Show black for all time.  Negotiations failed and so the side-shows closed creating an uncanny silence at the grounds.  After a while the Burra Progress Association through A.B. Riggs as Vice-President of the Show Society had discussions and with the Progress Association accepting responsibility for the increased fee the side-shows re-opened.

[Note.  This explanation of the trouble is refuted in 60, 44, 7 Nov. 1939, page 1.]

Teachers of distant schools refused to participate under the present system so school work was virtually absent except for work from the Church of England Day School and ‘Tulkara’ private training at Mt Bryan.

Cattle numbers were low.

Except for the school problem other pavilion entries were very numerous and pleasing.

Sheep numbers were up and English breeds more numerous, though Merinos, of course, predominated.  Ram entries were disappointing.

Poultry entries were numerous and local breeders did well.  There were no canaries, but pigeons were a strong class.

Pigs were surprisingly well represented.

Dog numbers were very disappointing.

Draught animals were good, but few and there were only two blood stock entries.

Horses in action were up to usual.

The luncheon by the President was in Centenary Hall.  Sid. McHugh MP officially opened the show and gave a speech that is reported in c. ½ column.  A.B. Riggs as Vice-President responded.  (Mr Warnes attended, but was not in good health and so handed over to Mr Riggs.)

The Prize List is printed on pages 1 & 4.

[Personal interest: R. Fuss is not listed as a steward for flowers, nor does he appear in the prize list.]
