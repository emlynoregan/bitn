Burra Town Council.  The Council has to consider what to do about the Waterworks.  There was a great waste of money in laying mains - sometimes at 3½” when a gas pipe would have sufficed.  The Mayor, P.L. Killicoat, thought the interest on capital was too large and if the Commissioner was truly informed a reduction might be made.  There was also a need to reduce expenditure and possibly to return the price of water to 6/- from 5/-.  He also thought the Government might need water this summer for the Broken Hill area.

Cr Pinch moved that the Waterworks be handed to the Government when the lease expired.

The Mayor said if it were made fit to drink they would pay.  A special meeting needs to consider the matter carefully.

Cr Pearce thought ratepayers should be consulted.

Cr O’Leary thought every other angle needed consideration before surrender of the lease.

Cr Pearce moved that the Town Clerk write to the Commissioner to see if the Government would grant an extension of the lease for three months.  Carried.
