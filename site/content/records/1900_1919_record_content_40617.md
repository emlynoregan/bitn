Advt.  M.A. Dwyer of Seacliff attacks the Methodists as being grossly under-represented in the 1st Expeditionary Force: only 2%.

‘are you keeping them home to do odd jobs, or perhaps drive you around in your motor cars, while the common drinking herd fight to save it for you? We, who love our liberty, and our glass of beer, when we feel inclined that way, think it time that you put some khaki breeches on your feather-legged-sons and send them to help our soldier boys, instead of maligning them.’

[But see the reply in XXII, 1931, 10 Feb. 1915.]
