Kooringa Hotel

[There is another oblique reference to the fire:

‘The new owners of the Kooringa Hotel are to be congratulated, as well as the hard working crews who spent many long hours in repairing and launching at least the bar and lounge areas to coincide with Field Week 1990.’]

Elsewhere in the issue there is a ‘Thank You’ from the proprietors to the CFS and MFS and Mt Bryan CFS for their prompt action in containing the fire, making it possible to open the doors on Wednesday afternoon.
