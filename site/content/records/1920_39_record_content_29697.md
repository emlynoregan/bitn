Frank Treloar wrote a letter concerning a piece of Burra malachite given as a gift to a visiting veterinary surgeon R.S. Crabb in c. 1850-57.  It was neglected in his stable for many years and then exhibited in a glass case at the Paris Exhibition where it gained a special mention and was then returned to Mr Crabb in Adelaide, where the writer saw it.
