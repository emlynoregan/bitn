Supreme Court Adelaide.

David McDonald Steele sued Thomas Badge Ashton over a contract made 27 July 1915.  The principal was £1,050.  Paid £550.  Due £500.  Interest £113.  Claim for £613.

The said contract was for the sale of goodwill of a medical practice to the defendant by the plaintiff and the appointments to the Burra Hospital as MO with the right to treat private patients.

Ashton knew the practice well, having sold it to Dr John Ikin Sangster Jnr on or about 8 December 1913.  Ashton said the plaintiff handed over nothing whatsoever and through his attorney, J.E.H. Winnall, deprived him of the MO position at the Burra Hospital.  The defendant paid £550 and the balance and interest has not become due as the contract has not been fulfilled by the plaintiff.

In counter suit the defendant claimed the £550 paid the plaintiff in August 1915 and £4,450 in damages including the loss of salary re hospital appointment and loss of salary as Officer of Health to the Local Board, loss of fees as Medical Examiner for Old Age Pensions, loss of fees from private patients as he was excluded from the hospital.

The Plaintiff denied that the practice had been defined as identical to the practice sold by the defendant in 1913 and denied all the other parts of the defence.

Denied handing over nothing.

Denied he, through his attorney, had deprived the defendant of appointment as MO at the hospital – or any of the other appointments mentioned.

Denied any inducement to enter into the 1915 agreement by any misrepresentation.

Denied any power to limit the defendant’s practice either in time or distance.

Admitted the payment of £550, but said it was under the agreement of 27 July 1915.

The plaintiff said that for a long time prior to June 1915 the plaintiff had been in partnership with John Ikin Sangster Jnr.  John Ikin Sangster Jnr died 12 June 1915 and he then purchased the interest of John Ikin Sangster Jnr deceased.  In July 1915 he negotiated with the defendant to sell the defendant the goodwill of the late Dr Sangster’s practice and the privilege of applying for Dr Sangster’s appointments, except the MO of the Local Board of Health and Medical Examiner of Invalid Pensions to which position the plaintiff had recently been appointed.

The plaintiff said the defendant had bought the medical practice of John Ikin Sangster Sen. about 8 September 1910 and had sold it on or about 8 December 1913 to John Ikin Sangster Jnr.  The defendant took over the practice under the agreement of 27 July 1915 and was appointed MO of the hospital on or about 12 August 1915 and also for the various lodges.  In or about June 1917 he was dismissed by the competent authorities as MO of the Burra Hospital.  The plaintiff had carried out the agreement of 27 July 1915.

After argument his honour agreed with Mr Smith for the plaintiff that the onus of proof that the money should not be paid lay with the defendant.

Eventually on the second day of the case the judge said that if he had to give a verdict for one or the other they could hardly work together thereafter in the same town and a settlement out of court would save expenses and be better in the interests of all.
