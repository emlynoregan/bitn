Burra & District Amateur Swimming Club held its AGM.

Mr E. Orchard said the club was formed in lieu of the Burra & District Swimming Pool Committee at the start of the 1960-61 season and affiliated with the SA Amateur Swimming Association for the 1961-62 season.  The last season was the club’s first serious season of competitive swimming and it was very satisfying to run out winners of the Eric Tilbrook shield in the triangular competition with Clare and Spalding.  This led to the formation recently of the Mid North Amateur Swimming Association of which Burra, Clare and Spalding are the foundation members.  In the past year a lease was obtained from the Burra Town Council and includes 60 ft beyond the present northern boundary to allow room for a barbecue and other entertainment facilities.  Over £200 was spent for cabinets for the PA system, stop watches and a filing cabinet.  In addition to inter-club competition, the two main functions are the Learn to Swim Campaign in the school holidays and the annual open carnival.  Recently the ladies have formed an auxiliary and so far they have added over £40 to funds.  Funds are needed to install a filtration and chlorination plant at an estimated cost of about £4,500 – fortunately subsidised pound for pound by the SA Government Tourist Bureau.
