Burra Kindergarten.  A meeting held in the RSL Rooms on 15 November to discuss forming a Kindergarten in Burra, was well attended.  Rev. R.S.T. Pettet took the chair.  Mrs I. Richardson addressed the group on the principles of Froebel, who first came up with the term Kindergarten.

They were:

The early years are vital in the physical, emotional and social development of the child.

Play is the only rational starting point in the education of a young child.

It is necessary to provide suitable play materials that will present a challenge and stimulus to the developing powers of the child.

The child needs the companionship of other children of a similar age, under the guidance of a teacher trained to aid his development.

The pre-school kindergarten opens up new avenues for a child to explore.  The equipment is graded so as always to offer a challenge, whether in muscular activity, appreciation of music or in intellectual activity.  Attention is paid to hygiene and cleanliness.  [Further details of the conduct of such a pre-school are given.]

Three main things needed to be considered in establishing a kindergarten:

Where would it be located?

How would it be staffed?

How would it be equipped?

Mrs Richardson said they thought question 1 could quickly be answered. [The answer is not reported.]

The kindergarten would be run by Mrs Richardson with the voluntary assistance of the mothers.

An appeal would be made to parents and friends re the equipping of the pre-school.

A committee was then established.
