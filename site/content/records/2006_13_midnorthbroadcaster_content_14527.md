Peter Batten writes, concerned at the noise issues relating to wind farms as raised at the recent Burra meeting with Senator Xenophon.  He suggests that all who are concerned access Stephen Cooperâ€™s report about the issue on the web, by typing in: wind turbine syndrome/wind turbine acoustic report (Australia) and then roll down and click on download.
