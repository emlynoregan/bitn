After Keilor’s evidence had been partly heard the case was adjourned and Fogarty released on bail while he sought legal advice and witnesses.  When the case was resumed the case was dismissed by the Magistrate.

The case on 6 November was brought by Fogarty alleging injury due to wrongful arrest and false imprisonment.  He claimed £100 damages.  Mrs Murphy gave evidence that on 9 June Fogarty had driven a spring cart with her, to his own home at about 6 p.m.  Evidence of Keilor’s actions after the first robbery was given by James Parker and his wife (Caroline), George Hare and James Warren.  John G. Heinrich testified to having travelled with Keilor as far as Sod Hut Inn, where they each had two glasses of beer, and afterwards till their roads diverged.  He said Keilor was perfectly sober then.  Keilor and his wife gave the same evidence as at the former trial.

The magistrate ordered a nonsuit, with each party to pay his own costs.
