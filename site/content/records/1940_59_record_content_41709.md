Obituary.  Harry Jones, who was born at Nackara 5 7 years ago, died 15 May.  He was educated at Nackara and Jamestown and at 13 assisted in droving sheep with his father from Oak Park to Hallett for the late Mr A. Pohlner.  He had an excellent knowledge of machinery.  Once he took a mob of cattle to Bransby Downs Station in Queensland where he took over management till enlisting in WWI in the 1st Light Horse.  He served as a sniper at Gallipoli and was wounded in the pelvis.  He spent 12 months in bed in the AIF Randwick Hospital in Sydney.  Swimming helped his recovery and he returned to Nackara and in 1924 married Miss Hilda Pohlner of Hallett.  About 12 months ago he collapsed while pulling fodder for cattle, but recovered.  He enjoyed motoring, golf, bridge, dancing, pigeon shooting and was keen on cricket, having captained Nackara for many years and recently got out of bed to see Nackara win two matches and the shield from Oodla Wirra and Dawson.  He went to hospital on Easter Monday.  He leaves a widow, one son and two daughters: D. Jones (Nackara), Clair Mrs P. Pfeiffer (Tanunda) & Joy Jones (Nackara).  [Born 9 January 1892 Nackara: died 15 May 1949 Terowie, residence Nackara.]
