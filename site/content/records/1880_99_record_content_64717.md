The Bible Christian Annual Dinner was held last Thursday and fine weather saw a fair number turn out.  Dr Brummitt spoke of the impending Methodist Union which he trusted would soon be consummated.  The Burra Bible Christian Church fills a unique place in the history of the denomination because it was here that the connexion held its first service in SA and built its first church and manse.  It has now the largest church of the denomination in Australia.  The first was built to house 200 before any minister came to Australia and it cost £213.  £150 was raised towards it and Mr Blatchford preached the first sermon.  Mr T. Richards and Mr John Pellew and other members of the first society are still alive and it must be a satisfaction to know that from such has grown a goodly tree sheltering some 7,000 members and 12,000 Sunday scholars with thousands of other adherents besides.  Rev. James Way and Rev. James Rowe arrived in SA at the end of 1850.  Way stayed in Adelaide while Rowe took charge of the work in Burra and also planted the connexion at Kapunda, Auburn, Watervale and Wakefield, though his work was checked by the Victorian Gold Rush.  Mr Rowe remained at Burra for five years and was replaced by Rev. T. Hillman and the Rev. James Rowe came after him.  [This doesn’t make sense.]
