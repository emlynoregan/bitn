SA Mines

In 1856 there were 58 mines of copper and lead.  Of these the chief was the famed Burra Burra copper mine.  Operations commenced there on 29 September 1845 by twelve miners.  Since that date the number of hands has increased to 1,013 and at this time there is a population connected with the mine and the associated Copper Works, of between 4,000 and 5,000.  The quantity of ore raised from the commencement is 128,400 tons, which would yield about 25,700 tons of fine copper and be worth in Adelaide at the present time, £2,688,500.  The colonial expenditure, exclusive of profits, amounts to £1,100,000 and in wages alone to £825,060.  The present annual expenditure is upwards of £100,000.  The aggregate dividend paid on each £5 share amounts to £200 and the total amount of dividends paid is £492,800.  Shares are presently valued at £319,320 and the original capital was £12,300, which included the purchase of 10,000 acres of land, still held by the Association, with additions since made to it.  The afore-mentioned expenditure is exclusive of the immense disbursements by the English & Australian Copper Company, which is engaged in reducing the Burra Burra ores to copper.  The surface area of the operation covers 15 acres and the length of open levels or galleries is eight miles.
