On the Thursday before Christmas the annual hospital treat was successfully staged.  Presents were arranged for all and the garden and verandah duly decorated and Japanese lanterns strung up.  Mr Treloar reported a little on the hospital history.  It had serviced some 13,000 patients since 1876.  A concert was staged and supper provided.
