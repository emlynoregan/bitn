IOR.  The Rechabite picnic and sports at Princess Royal on Boxing Day were a great success.  In excellent weather all kinds of vehicles made their way there, yet many had to walk home, as cabs were not up to time.  There must have been fully 1,000 in attendance.  Brothers met at the lodge at about 9 a.m. and marched through the town led by the Burra Band before being conveyed in wagons to Princess Royal.  Only three entered the big event: the Demonstration Handicap.  Harrisâ€™s win seemed popular, though he was not a local.  There were also only three in the bicycle race, which was a good contest between Ford and Anderson, being won by Ford.  The 440 yards wheel race was won by W.H. Hardy.

The concert was largely attended and was marred only by the larrikinism at the back of the hall.
