Burra Town Council, Monday

Municipal Elections.  Cr Bednall wrote resigning due to the changed relationship of the Council with his firm.  Continuing as a Councillor could result in severe monetary losses.

His resignation was accepted and the fine remitted.

The Mayor expressed his appreciation of Cr Bednall’s service.

Cr Kellaway said he would not seek re-election.

The Mayor, Mr M. Collins, said he would stand again to beat the five year record of Mr Crewes.

We hear that Fred Collins will stand for Cr Bednall’s seat and J. Edgar Pearce for that of Cr Kellaway.

[Mr Collins needed to count Mr Crewes’ years in office again.  Mr Crewes was Mayor for the six years 1914-19, but also for 1900, 1901, 1921 & 1922.  In the end Mr Collins also served for six years in succession from 1923 to 1928.]
