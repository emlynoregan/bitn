The Anzac Service in Market Square on Sunday afternoon was well attended.  Some 160 returned men attended despite many having been in Adelaide the previous day for the march.  Mr W. Kotz & Mr M. Burt were the flag bearers.  The Ex-Navalmen’s Band led the parade.  Mr Griffen, RSL President, directed proceedings.  Rev. C. Christopher led the Ministers’ Fraternal and was assisted by Pastor B.V. Ashdown.  Rev. A.W. Pain (Anglican) gave the address and called attention to those who served and fell in the Korean and Malayan conflicts.  There was an evening Anzac Service at St Mary’s, conducted by Rev. Pain.

War Memorial Oval.  The Burra Football Club and Town Council have agreed on a rental of £4-4-0 for the season.

The Women’s Fire-Fighting Auxiliary will combine with the CWA following a meeting on 7 April.

Accident.  A utility, driven by William C.D. Connors of Mannunda Station via Yunta, skidded and rolled over on loose gravel near Schuyler’s Crossing on the Burra-Mt Bryan Road.  Though not seriously hurt, the driver was trapped in the cabin with two sheep dogs until released by passing motorists.  The utility’s load was widely scattered.

Accident.  A cream coloured utility demolished six guide posts at Burra North on Friday 24 April, went down a two-foot embankment, but failed to stop or report the accident.

Accident.  On Sunday morning a Chevrolet sedan, driven by Mr Thomas King of Parkside, crashed over the Bon Accord Bridge.  It was coming from Broken Hill and failed to take the turn at the approach to the bridge.  Damage to the car is estimated at £300.  Neither the driver nor passenger was injured, although they were shaken.
