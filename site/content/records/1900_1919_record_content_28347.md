Burra Town Council, 19 December.

A.W. Dobbie quotes £8-10-0 for the plate for the King Edward VII Memorial.

The District Councils of Hallett and Burra will support the Town Council’s complaint about the railway timetable.

Prices are to be got for a new trough etc. in Market Square.

J.E. Winnall has been retained as Council solicitor for 1911.

Mr S. Burns is to be asked to open the King Edward VII memorial.

Dr Ashton reports two cases of whooping cough and one of typhoid.

[The Council seems to have dropped the idea of having a town pound.]
