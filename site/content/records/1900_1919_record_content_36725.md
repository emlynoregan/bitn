John McLaren writes protesting a report about Paxton Square in the paper.  It had said the Mayor had asked Mr McLaren what the position of Council was in the matter and that Mr McLaren had said he didnâ€™t know.  This was wrong in fact.  The Mayor had not consulted me and therefore I did not give the reply he stated I did.  A man came to see me with a letter from Mr Hawkes asking about a room in the Square.  I read the letter and re-addressed the envelope to E.J. Davey as Town clerk and directed the bearer to the Council Chamber.  He said he had a letter for Mr Crewes, the contents of which I of course had no knowledge.
