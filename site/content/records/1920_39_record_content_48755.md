Burra Town Council, 4 December

Congratulations were offered all around after the recent elections.

Government subsidy for the year was fixed at £84 compared with £94 last year.

The Council overdraft was £120.

A fair amount of rates were outstanding.  [The Mayor’s report suggested c. £36.]

With respect to the Christmas drive for employment:

Cr Kellaway moved £25 be set aside and application be made to have it subsidised £2 for £1.  [The sum was later changed to £50.]

The Mayor said if men got work in the Christmas drive rations were cut out.

Cr Dow said there were men who kept off the ration on the list who needed help and they should not merely take a list of those on rations.

Carried unanimously and an advertisement is to be placed in the Burra Record for names.

The Water Supply Department is to be asked to move pipes on the Black Bridge where they take up a yard of road space and to place them under the bridge.  Cyclone wire is to be added to the south side of the bridge.

Queen St Footbridge to be repaired.

Local Board of Health

The Inspector reported one death from measles and 26 cases.  The Mayor said many cases were not reported.
