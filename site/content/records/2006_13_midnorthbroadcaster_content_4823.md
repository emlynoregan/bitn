The Burra National Trust meeting on 21 February finally resolved on a reformed Passport Key Trail.  The new format is intended to halt a decline in sales.  Some of that is believed to be due to repeat visitors and some due to a modern desire for an interactive experience; preferring to talk to people and ask questions rather than simply to read information or signage.  The new format offers a mixture of self-guided and guided experiences.
