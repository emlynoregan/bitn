Fire.  The fire in the brewery paddock was seen before 5 p.m. on Tuesday evening last week.  The flames were rushing from the top of the hill in a northeast direction rapidly.  The flames were attacked on the western flank and conquered on that side, but moved rapidly on the north and northeast.  A couple of haystacks in the centre of the paddock were amazingly saved by a band of men with wet bags.  The cattle were successfully moved.  Little more was done as the metal road to the northeast formed a ready firebreak.  The cause was unknown.  Some suspect arson and others a smoker.
