Mr E. Finch, a farmer of Burra who is visiting Adelaide, reports a steady yield of gold from the mine of the Curlew GM Syndicate of which he is the chairman.  To date 266 tons of ore have been put through the battery from the property and yielded 736 oz.  The March crushing of 36 tons returned 78 oz and April is expected to exceed this.

Baldina GM Syndicate has put through a small parcel expected to go well over 1 oz per ton.

Bylesâ€™ Mongolata GM Co. is making good progress.

It is said that if Mongolata were 500 miles away from the city it would be employing 1,000 men, but the State government seems to ignore this most valuable field for some reason.
