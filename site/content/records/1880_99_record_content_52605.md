Sparks

Two cabbies fined £1 each at the Redruth Court last Wednesday.

Polkinghorne who ran 3rd at Burra sports has won the Glenelg Sheffield Handicap.

Williams could have scooped the pool at Booborowie but he said it wasn’t good enough.

Richard & Bottrill divided the 1st & 2nd prizes for the Laura Bicycle Handicap.

Fire destroyed several acres of grass in Mr Gebhardt’s paddock Friday morning.

Women in Melbourne have petitions for the death sentence passed on Mrs Frances Knorr, the Brunswick baby killer, to be commuted.
