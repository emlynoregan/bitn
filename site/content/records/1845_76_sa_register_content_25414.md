Kooringa Primitive Methodist Chapel held its Anniversary services on Sunday.  Preacher was Rev. T. Jarrett.  The total collections for the services, Sunday school and tea meeting were c. £33.

St Joseph’s Catholic Church benefited from a bazaar held at the Institute on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday to aid the building fund.  Over £100 was raised.

Mt Bryan East.  The crops are looking well and on Thursday A.W.P. Ward gave a lecture at Razorback Chapel on ‘Teetotalism’ and 18 names were added to the pledge book.
