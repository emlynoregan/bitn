‘Back to Burra’: Friday

This brought good weather and further charabanc trips and in the afternoon a mock court in Market Square.  Police women Maud Ridgway, Jessie McNeil, Jean Herbert and Edythe Richards ran in hosts of residents for breaches of the law.  The magistrates were W.J.C. Ewins, George Hann & E.J. Marston with A.L. Bence as beadle and E.J. Davey as clerk.  [A list of offences and fines is printed.]

In the evening a grand concert was held in the Institute by local performers assisted by Miss H. Barnes of Adelaide and again the hall was crowded.  Murison’s Jazz Orchestra played from 7.30 to 8.00.

In the Queen Competition Miss Melva Lynch came first with 21,531 votes, leading Maud Ridgway with 21,334.  She was crowned after the final concert.

Thanks are then extended to the principal organisers.
