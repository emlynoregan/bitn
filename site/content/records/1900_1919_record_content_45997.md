Burra Town Council.

The Mayor said the fence at the station yard had to be moved back.  It intruded onto the road ¼ of a chain (16.5 feet) and was unsafe.  Matter to stand over pending an inspection.

The contractor for the suspension bridge was granted an extension of time.

Letter from Messrs Bright & Bright for J. Lewis threatening legal action unless the Council gave the lease it was alleged they had agreed to.

Cr Killicoat said the objection to an exclusive right was that anyone crossing from Princess Royal would be stopped and would have to go to Farrell’s Flat.

The Town Clerk was not sure Mr Winnall had written to Hon. J. Lewis on this point as he was away.  All correspondence to be reviewed and a decision made on the reply at next meeting.

The Inspector said the land offered by R.M. McBride as a quarry was unsuitable, but there was a suitable site in the old mine.

Cr Killicoat asked if there was ever a motion passed to fence Best Place, as some ratepayers were anxious a portion be fenced.

Cr Lane said there was a motion that it not be fenced.  It was thought that if it were fenced off level there would not be a chain road.  The Government had taken away the water troughs when they took over the water supply, but it was not with the idea of fencing.

Cr Killicoat asked if the Council would object to a monument there.  The first three soldiers to die were from Aberdeen and it was the intention to place a monument there in best Place.

Cr Lane said, though this was a worthy idea other men had fallen also and it was the intention of Burra & District to erect a monument to all.

The Mayor said there was the nucleus of a fund to erect a monument in Market Square.  He would prefer a single monument for all and would not subscribe to one that was for Kooringa boys only.

Ct Killicoat said that personally he would not subscribe to a separate monument to any great extent.  His brother had died, but he intended to place a memorial window in the church.

Matter deferred for further consideration.
