2 April 1875, page 7

Kooringa, 31 March.

A special train provided a cheap excursion to Riverton on Good Friday and as a result Kooringa was almost deserted.  About 200 took advantage of the fares.

Murray & Coventryâ€™s Circus has performed at Burra for two nights to respectable audiences.

T. Fitzgerald, a youth working at the Burra Mines, was thrown when a horse he was riding to the stables reared.  It reared again while he was on the ground and descended onto his stomach.  Dr Cave is attending and the patient is making favourable progress.
