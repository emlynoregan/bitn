Letter.  Luigi Rossi, project manager for Burra Morgan Road project writes in response to Des Woolley’s letter, pointing out that Woolley had mistaken the primer seal for the final seal.  The primer prepares the road and makes for better adherence of the final seal.  The final seal must be sprayed when the temperature is warmer than 20ºC for at least 8 hours a day and is due to be done on 20 October.
