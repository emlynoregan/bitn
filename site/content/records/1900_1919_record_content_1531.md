Burra Defence Rifle Club.  Burra fired a match against Orroroo last Wednesday and were given a 42 point handicap because they are still using the old Martini Henry Rifles while other clubs have modern rifles.  Orroroo scored 620 and Burra 452 + 42 = 494.

A match on the same day saw J.A. Pearce produce the highest score of 84, W.B. Page one of 81 and R.D. Pascoe one of 80.

Last weekend they fired a match with Pt Pirie at Pt Pirie and Pt Pirie 716 defeated Burra 695.
