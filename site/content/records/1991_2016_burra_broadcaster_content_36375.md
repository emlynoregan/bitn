The Enterprise Zone [south] east of Burra in the Bower area has been authorised by the Minister for Urban Development and Planning.  The concept was promoted by the MNRDB and supported by the Goyder and Mid Murray Councils.  It will promote intensive animal keeping i.e. feedlots, piggeries, chicken facilities and waste composting.  Provided applications meet the objectives and principles of the zone, they will be classified category 1 and will be exempt from public consultation.
