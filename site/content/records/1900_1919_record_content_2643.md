Trooper H.C. Packard joined the Imperial Contingent in 1900 and fought first in an engagement between Kroonstadt and Lindley.  He was with the soldiers that surrounded General Primslow and De Wet, though De Wet eluded capture and was chased to Vredeford, again escaping.  Packard reports several stories of war conditions.  He was invalided home with enteric fever, but returns to active service in a few days time.
