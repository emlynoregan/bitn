Burra Town Council, 3 June

The Railway Commissioner advised that he was considering the use of the Aberdeen ballast Quarry instead of the Sleep’s Hill Quarry, following his meeting with a deputation from the district, led by the Mayor.

Council agreed to co-operate with the Unemployed Relief Council in a £ for £ scheme of work for men on rations.  The work had to be such as would not otherwise be done by Council.  Cr Kellaway moved acceptance of the scheme, though he did not like the fact that those who would not do some casual labour would get rations all the same.  Cr Dow thought some trees might be planted.  The Mayor agreed and thought some straightening of creek banks could also be undertaken.  It was left to the Public Works Committee to devise a scheme of work.

L. Cullen resigned as pound keeper and was replaced by W. Voumard, who had been acting pound keeper.

Ways to assist the News blanket fund were discussed and a committee formed to promote the effort.

Crs Riggs and Jennison said they would stand for re-election.
