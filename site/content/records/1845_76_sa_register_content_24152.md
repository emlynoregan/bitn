Mr Cave said losses frequently arose because farmers were too niggardly, refusing to pay the labouring man 3 or 4 shillings a day more wages and this in the hope they would be able to gather the corn in all right in time.  Another complaint against the agriculturalist was they did not winnow sufficiently.  Burra farmers should grow an acre or two of holcus or lucerne.  Likewise he could not see why a man should not improve his farm by planting a few trees around the homestead.  He had become interested in the imported grasses cultivated at the Botanic Garden – particularly one called ‘Buffalo’. 

Robert Gill, a farmer, said labour of the right sort was not available when wanted.  ‘There might be plenty of men used to follow a flock of sheep with a dog to help them, but they complained that farmers’ hours were too long and the work too hard, and they would not do such labour for any money.’

Mr Young jocosely remarked that someone had said there were no ruins to be seen in the colony, but that person had only to come to Kooringa to discover his mistake.  Certainly the state of Kooringa was not a progressive one, but whether that was to be referred to the conduct of the landlords, the least said the better.  He had been there twenty years and seen many ups and downs.  The first supporters of the place were the miners – very good ones; the next help was the sheep farmers, who were excellent also and now they had the agriculturalists coming around them and he thought they would be more certain customers than the other classes.  Last season they had a good harvest and they had behaved well and spent money freely.
