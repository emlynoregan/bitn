Burra Burra Show Inc. held its AGM.  President Rex C. Warnes reported a very successful 1960 show in perfect weather, with gate takings of £217 and £38 from the dance run by the Rural Youth Club.  Entries were good and the show was opened by the Minister of Agriculture Hon. D.N. Brookman.  He also opened the new Wool Pavilion, which housed a record entry of 117 fleeces.  Membership remains at about 300, but the financial position is not quite as good as in previous years.  ‘Much maintenance work is being done and we are indebted to Mr R. Fuss for the time he gives this society.  He is not only saving us money, but is improving our assets as well.’

[Mr R. Fuss was present at the meeting.]

The year left the overdraft at £280-9-7, slightly up on last year.

Elected: Patron, A.B. Riggs; President, Rex C. Warnes and Vice-Presidents, C.F. Pearce & B.A. Riggs.
