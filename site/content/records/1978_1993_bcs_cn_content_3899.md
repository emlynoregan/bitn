BCS.  Five members of BCS ancillary staff took industrial action on Friday 27 March as a result of uncertainty about future employment.  BCS has had a reduction of 75 hours in ancillary staff time (equivalent to two full-time positions) in the last year.  The Government recently made a further 4% cut in ancillary time for schools.  Teaching staff expressed support, but remained on duty.
