Editorial on the increasingly grave situation with respect to farmers in the north and other drought-affected areas and with their suppliers of goods.  The aid must go far beyond that of last yearâ€™s Land Act.

Arrears of interest must be remitted.

Rules of surrender of land and re-selection must be liberalised.

Those wishing to change conditions of old agreements to the more liberal conditions now applying must be allowed to do so.
