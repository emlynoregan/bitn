Victoria Park Improvements

A deputation from the Victoria Park Improvement Committee waited on Council last week to ask permission to effect improvements.

Mr L. Hawke said the object was to seek co-operation and permission to raise funds to improve the park and to ask the Council to make available the £400 it had in hand, previously borrowed to build a swimming pool, or to call a meeting of ratepayers to approve such a move.

The Committee believed a much better playing surface was needed along with a saucer track for cycling and running.  Test holes showed 18-24 inches of soil could be removed from the highest to lowest side.  They wanted to make a retaining wall from the goal posts to the main entrance gates varying from 0 to 4 or 5 feet with a safety fence.  The cycle track to be 15ft wide and 3ft high on the outside.  The oval to be planted in couch grass and a turf wicket laid.  Water to be by underground pipe or sprinklers.  Trees to be lopped and the shed remodelled in a different location.  The main gate now to become a pedestrian access with a new vehicle access at the south end.

C. Morrison said the town presently had four cricket teams and the Easter Carnival could be repeated.  SA Cricket Assoc. could give advice on laying a turf wicket – the local carpenter with advice had done so at Clare.  He outlined how other inputs could be obtained free by donation.  He had a plan which showed hoe these improvements could be integrated with a proposed War Memorial, tennis courts and a swimming pool in the future.

Cr Kellaway said ratepayer sanction would be needed to access the £400.

The Mayor said permission to raise money was not a problem, but any War Memorial proposal was in the hands of ratepayers.  He feared the cost would be much higher than any of the Committee realised.  The Drill Hall [part of the War Memorial proposal] would cost about £600 and the cost of water would be enormous.  He also pointed out that at present piping, cement and cyclone fencing were practically unobtainable.  Would the oval be large enough to park cars and leave room for spectators?

Mr Hawke said yes – and the aim at present was to improve the oval, not to press for any Memorial Scheme.

The matter will lie on the table for a fortnight.
