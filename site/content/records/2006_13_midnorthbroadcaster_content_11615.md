Friends of Burra Parks have had an active year in which they have carried out weeding programs, repaired fences, surveyed rare plant species and demolished an old building.  An ongoing program seeks to establish two species of Wallaby Grass (Austrodanthonia) on the Mokota Conservation Park.  The group’s AGM will be held on 27 January at 6 p.m. at Gally’s Meeting House and Café in Farrell Flat.
