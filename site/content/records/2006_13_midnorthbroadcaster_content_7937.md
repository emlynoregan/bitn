Bishop Greg O’Kelly SJ was installed at a ceremony at St Mark’s Catholic Cathedral Pt Pirie yesterday.  The apostolic nuncio Giuseppe Lazzarotto, Sydney’s Cardinal George Pell and the Adelaide archbishop Philip Wilson joined bishops from across Australia for the installation.  Bishop O’Kelly takes over the 980,000 square kilometre diocese from Bishop Eugene Hurley who was appointed Bishop of Darwin in July 2007.  Bishop O’Kelly has a distinguished record in education and last month the Australian Bishops in Conference elected him chairman of the Bishops’ Commission for Catholic Education.
