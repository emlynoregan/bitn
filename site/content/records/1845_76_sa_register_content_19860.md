SA Mining Association.  Editorial

At present at the Burra Mines 445 people are employed and a large quantity of ore is being raised, but the low price of copper keeps down the prospects of work.

Shortly after the last Directors’ Report, which referred to the increased price of copper, there was a serious financial panic in London and the copper price fell by £8 per ton.  The price has continued to decline to the lowest point in 16 years.  The projected profits will not now appear.  The latest reports show a rising copper price.

Despite employing fewer hands and working almost exclusively from old pitches the ore raised in the past six months is estimated at 2,626 tons of average 22% fine copper.  The proposal to reconstruct the company has been postponed until financial conditions improve.  In the meantime Directors will aim to limit expenditure while continuing to develop the mine.

Captain Roach reports:

Graves’ Engine Shaft is being sunk by 9 men and is 20 fathoms deep and in sinking the last ten fathoms a grey ore lode was discovered.  Samples have assayed at 32 and 52% copper.  The lode has taken a diagonal direction into the western hill.  Once a plat has been finished a crosscut will be made west to investigate this lode.  Sinking of the shaft will continue to the 30 fathom level.

Morphett’s Sump-men, when not engaged in the engine-shaft, are sinking Hector’s Shaft from the 50 to the 60 fathom level.

Tribute pitches in Peacock’s Main and Air Shafts are looking much more favourable.

Pitches in Ayers’ and Graham’s No. 1 & No. 2 shafts are yielding the usual quantities of or of a good percentage.

Tribute ground in Kingston’s, Roach’s and Stocks’ Shafts is satisfactory.
