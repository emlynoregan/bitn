Burra Hospital.

A document in the possession of Council shows that not only is Council the trustee of the Hospital, but also its registered owner.  In 1877 the property was sold to the Council by SAMA for Â£500.  This makes rather comical the struggle of the owners to get a representative on the Hospital Board of Management.  Also recently a great portion of the old building was demolished and a new one erected without reference to the wishes of the owner.  More recently the Council was told that if some monetary arrangement were not arrived at they would have to isolate cases of infectious disease somewhere else.
