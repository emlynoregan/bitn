James Miller writes re the mine.  He says he was an engineer for the Burra Mines for some years before it closed and the pumps were his department.  He assumes the estimates of £6,000 to £10,000 to drain it are based on old pumping methods.  He advocates abandoning the old mechanisms and going for the pneumatic principle.  His method could be executed and fixed for considerably under £2,000.
