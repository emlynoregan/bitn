Friends of the Burra Railway Station has reached the Semi-Finals of the Junction Australia Connecting Communities Awards in the SA Community Achievement Awards.  The nomination acknowledges the great work of the group and especially of Roy Taplin in restoring the station.  The building has now been saved for future generations and is part of the award-winning Burra Passport Heritage Trail.  The Pygmy Bluetongue Conservation Association has a display in the former ticket office and a megafauna display from nearby Redbanks Conservation Reserve co-ordinated by the SA Museum, is also there.  The venue has been used for weddings and birthday parties, meetings and open days.  Winners will be announced on 29 September.
