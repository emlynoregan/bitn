Editorial on the Annual Report of the Mayor.

The editor comments on the report.  It is a most complete document and the best produced so far.  The assessment for 1892 rose slightly due to new buildings: from £9,481-19-0 to £9,522-9-0.  (In 1881 it had been £13,664; in 1883 £14,450; and in 1884 £16,149)  We expect it to fall in future years due to many old buildings being in a poor state.  There has been little to spend in street repairs etc. but it has been evenly and judiciously done: North Ward, £79-6-8; East Ward, £75-5-7; West Ward, £89-5-1.

500 trees were planted, mainly to replace losses.

Inspector J.R. Gray has seen the sanitary standard of the town maintained.

The main road grant of £325 has been well spent.

The Bon Accord Bridge is nearing completion.

The railway crossing remains unprotected.

The unclaimed North Ward allotments require attention as rates remain unpaid.

Kooringa cemetery has been extended and enclosed in a stone wall at a cost of £105-4-1.  This took the cemetery fund from a credit of £99-10-9 to a debit of £29.

At the Waterworks the acquisition of a new Cornish boiler should see that last year’s inconvenience is not repeated.  The capital account there now sits at £7,842.
