Burra Town Council 16 February.

Plans for a new bridge in Thames St are to be prepared.

Council has about £80 in private contributions to the Market Square Well Account.

Young St residents have asked for the water main to be extended from Muirhead [sic] St [i.e. Morehead] for 217 yards.  The matter will lie on the table for two weeks in case there is a similar request from Redruth so that the two could be considered together.

Council will make representations to the Government re the unsatisfactory railway connections between the Northern and the Yorke Peninsula lines.

Cr Ridgway moved to have labourers find their own picks and shovels and keep them in order.  Cr Dunstan would 2nd this if the words ‘except sharps’ were included.  The amendment was included, but the motion was then lost.

For this year Ayers St will require £30 plus the £20 already granted.

There was then a debate over the relative merits of the Gaol Road and Ayers St (the Cemetery Road).  It was eventually resolved that surplus monies accumulated from the slaughterhouse and the cemetery would be appropriated to South Ward.
