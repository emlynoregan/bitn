About 15” of water invaded A. Thamm’s.

Mrs Allen’s house was also flooded with furniture floating in the rooms.  [The old Bushman’s Rest Hotel]  Here it was high enough to run out of the windows, leaving cartloads of mud behind.

Drew and Crewes lost 7 cases of benzine, 3½ cases of kerosene and 1 of methylated spirits, along with fencing posts, strainers and the harness and lorry at the ford.

Sara & Co had their benzine magazine flooded and their chaff shed was 3’ deep in water.

News from Mt Bryan and Hallett is scarce, but falls there were heavy.  At Leighton falls were light only and at Baldina only 1.64” fell, but floodwaters came down the creek.  Barker Bros lost 60 sheep and A.G. Gebhardt of Mackerode lost 40.  At Hogback the flooding was severe and at King’s Well the torrent was half a mile wide and 4’ deep.  Several miles of the Eastern Telephone line are washed away.  Clearly much fencing has been lost.  There are also further sheep losses.

Eastern rainfalls were very variable from as low as 0.35” at Glenora and 0.35” at Koomooloo to 1.64” at Baldina and 1.50” at Mongolata.
