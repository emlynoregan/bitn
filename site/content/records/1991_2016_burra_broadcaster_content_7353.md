Burra Arts Council Branch last year made a grant of $11,000 to the playwright Mij Tanith to produce a play for the J150 celebrations.  All that was produced was a 28-page document, which has been described as ‘elementary and unacceptable’.  The branch will not seek further funding for this project.
