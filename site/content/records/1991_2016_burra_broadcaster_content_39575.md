Burra Railway Station Celebration Dinner

The dinner held on Saturday 9 August was very successful.  It was a fundraiser to furnish the proposed Bed & Breakfast at the station, as well as to celebrate the completion of the restoration.  The former refreshment room was filled to capacity.  Pip Edson, on behalf of Friends of the Burra Railway Station made an eloquent speech of thanks to all who have assisted and especially to Roy Taplin, without whose huge effort the project could not have succeeded.  Among the guests was Peter Hasse and his mother Isabel (formerly Bampton) who were residents in the 1950s and 60s, when Isabel’s late husband, Jim, was a porter at the station for about 13 years.  Peter kindly donated some of his father’s mementos.  Also present from Murray Bridge was Denis Smith, who has produced a 26-page A4 pictorial book on the Burra Station – available from Burra Visitor Centre, the Town Hall and the Burra Station.
