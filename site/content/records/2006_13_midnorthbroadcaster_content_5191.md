Burra Red Cross has donated $254 to aid the establishment of the Burra Men’s Shed, and another $254 to the Leisure Group and the same amount to the Community Library to purchase equipment suitable for pre-school children.  The sum was raised by the hard work of Heidi Mirtschin and her team with Red Cross members in the baby competition.
