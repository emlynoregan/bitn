Burra Town Council, Monday

Cr Allen moved the suspension of standing orders to demand an apology from Cr Woollacott for remarks made at the Ratepayers’ Meeting.  They had constituted a slur on the Mayor that Councillors could not express their opinion.  Carried.

Cr Woollacott wanted Cr Allen to put in writing what he objected to.

Mayor: confine yourself to the motion or apologise.

Woollacott: What have I to apologise for?  If I hurt anyone’s feelings I am sorry.

Cr Woollacott said he cast no reflection on the personal honour of the Mayor; I criticised certain public actions.

The Mayor said Cr Woollacott refuses to apologise.  Eventually Cr Woollacott said:

‘I will apologise for anything I said that was untrue.’

With that Cr Allen was satisfied and moved acceptance.  Carried.
