Booborowie Centenary will be celebrated on 30 April and 1 May to coincide with the proclamation of the town on 29 March 1877.  Development of the district went back to 1843 when two brothers, M.J. & J.H. Browne, both doctors, played an important part in opening up the Northern Flinders Ranges.  It is believed that in the early days much of the Booborowie land was swampy, but pumping and farming has changed the nature of the land.  There will be a back-to-school and roll call of the South and North Booborowie Schools at 2.30 p.m. and tea in the Hall at 5 p.m.  On Sunday there will be a combined church service in the Hall and the unveiling of a commemorative plaque, followed by a barbecue at the oval.
