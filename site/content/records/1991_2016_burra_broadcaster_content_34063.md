Objection to planned development - Anthony Thorogood & Nell Seidel separately have lengthy objections to a proposal to change farmland immediately before the first house at the southern entrance to the town to be zoned General Industry – Metal Manufacturing.  They say the application would result in the entrance to the town being dominated by:

A large shed 27 m x 12 m x more than 6 m high

Two large signs 10 m x 1 m saying ‘Shamrock Fabrication Welding Guillotine Folding

A line-up of trailers parked along the road ready to sell

They also state other objections:

Much noise would be generated

There could be pollution from spray paint drift

Welding would interfere with radio and TV reception

The welding and cutting would increase the threat to the town of fires

It is pointed out that there is ample space for such activity in the Burra North Mine Area and along the bypass road.  Ratepayers should not be misled either about supposed employment opportunities – the application states only one employee.

[Although the applicant is not named here, it soon became clear that it was Peter Kelly.]
