Burra Co. VF held its dinner and social at the Commercial Hotel last Wednesday.  Lieut. Butterworth presided in the absence of Captain Holder.  Over 30 members and friends attended.  P. Lane proposed ‘The Parliament and Our Members’, 2nd by Mr J. Cooksley and supported by W.H. Hardy.  Col-Sgt Watt was presented with a gold medal from the company for services since its inauguration.  The chairman’s remarks were supported by Sgt Anderson, Private Linkson and Private Cooksley.  D.S. Packard proposed Capt. Holder and local volunteers.  W.T. Rabbich proposed the Town & Trade of Burra.

Note that in the course of his speech P. Lane said that Capt. Holder was constitutionally weak, but Mr Packard added that ‘it was not always the strongest in health that could lead a regiment to victory, but one strong in pluck.  He was sure Mr Holder would do his duty if he died in the attempt.  He believed him to be a good man.  He had shown his pluck, in fact in everything he had shown himself a man.’

G. Parks responded to Mr Rabbich and Mr Pederson supported.  W. Killicoat proposed the Mayor & Councillors and Cr Sampson responded, supported by Cr Watt.  J. Jordan proposed The Press.  T.T. Shortridge responded on behalf of the Adelaide Advertiser and W.H. Hardy & T. Nicholls on behalf of the Burra Record.

It was resolved that the company carry on.
