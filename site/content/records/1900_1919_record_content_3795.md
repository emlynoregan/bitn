Theft at Rev. Murphy’s.  Following the recent theft from Rev. W.G.M. Murphy of food and clothing suspicion fell on a young girl recently employed there, but she could not be found to be questioned.  On returning to his home on Wednesday evening he found a bundle near the door comprising his mackintosh and other articles that had been taken.  When he called his wife she heard a noise in one room and Rev. Murphy saw Olive Fox exit through the study window.  She was caught near the fence.  She had been hiding for some days in the Methodist Church yard at Redruth, behind a thick clump of trees, despite heavy frosts.  She was not found even by the black tracker brought in.  The girl had wrapped her feet in her flannel undergarment to avoid making a noise and to conceal her tracks.  She was returned to the Reformatory where she had been before working for Mr Murphy.  She had been sent there for being a neglected child living with Aboriginals in the SE.  The police had spent five days scouring the country for Olive Fox.  She might have eluded capture had she hidden her luggage instead of leaving it outside Mr Murphy’s house on her second visit.
