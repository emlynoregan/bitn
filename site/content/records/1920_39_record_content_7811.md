Burra Town Council: Special Electric Light Meeting, Monday.

The Mayor had talked to Mr Weedon, manager of the Adelaide Electric Supply Co., who said they aimed to build a line to Broken Hill – but that would be many years before it was done due to the pressure of work in Adelaide.  They would certainly take over a local scheme at that time if it was properly constructed.

Two schemes are before the Council:  Mr A.E. Marr offers to light every street for £8,700 while the other offer is to light the more closely settled parts from the Railway Station to the Hospital for £5,816 (or perhaps for £5,000, as material costs were falling).  This latter scheme could be extended later.

Cr Collins thought a scheme properly managed could be payable.

Cr Kellaway warned that Moonta’s estimate was £4,000 and it ended up costing £6,000.

Cr Bartholomaeus said that the ratepayers would oppose it.

Cr Kellaway said the estimate for wages was too low.

The Mayor said the present cost of lighting would buy interest on a £5,000 proposal.

It was resolved to submit plans to the Adelaide Electric Supply Co. before anything else was done.
