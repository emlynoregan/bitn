Burra Burra DC held ratepayers’ meetings at Mt Bryan & Booborowie last week.  Issues discussed included the current financial situation, future financial strategies, ratings policy, Market Square and future projects.  Many of the Council borrowings were self servicing loans taken out by organisations like the Lewis Trust or sporting clubs, or loans taken out by previous councils for capital works.  District Clerk Mr Walsh said the overall deficit for 1985-86 would be $86,500, which was not much different from last year.  The main factors in an increase were the cut in road funding and the rural recession.  Mr Hawker said the proposed Burra North by-pass was not a Council sponsored project, but had been proposed by the Highways Department.  The Black Bridge at Burra North had a weight limit of 20 tonnes and could not be upgraded.  There was as yet no starting date for the Highways Department project.

During the meeting plans were tabled for the proposed redevelopment of the Morphett’s boiler-house.  Council was seeking Australian Bicentennial Funding for this project.  The plans would preserve existing walls and restore the roofline to create a space to house copper and mining history.

Consultants were in the last stages of developing the Supplementary development Plan for the Council.

Council would also be seeking ratepayers’ ideas on ward boundaries because new legislation limited the variation in the number of electors each councillor could represent to 10%.  Currently Burra had four town councillors representing about half the electorate and seven rural representatives from the other half.  This imbalance will have to be addressed.

A total of about 150 electors attended the meetings.
