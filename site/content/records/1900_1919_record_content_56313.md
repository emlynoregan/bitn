Local Board of Health

Messrs G. Lawn & Co. demands payment of Â£20 for the alleged illegal destruction of a bullock said by the Inspector to have had an internal growth, said by Dr Williams to be cancer.  Failure to pay within a week will lead to a lawsuit.  Mr Winnall has been retained by the Board.
