BCS.  Staff Profile: Julian Turner

Born in Yorkshire.  Went to school in London, but was driven to Australia by the winter of 1963.  Finished High School at Riverton and Nuriootpa.  Picked fruit over summers while attending Roseworthy College.  For many years combined travel with teaching in Tasmania, WA, Indonesia, London and Nigeria.  Became a permanent relieving teacher.  Burra is my 24th school and am teaching Agriculture and Science at secondary level.  Single with no children, never lived in New York, am a keen bushwalker, white water rafter, mill pond canoeist and runner.  Interested in classical and folk dance.
