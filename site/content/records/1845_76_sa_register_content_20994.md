Kooringa News, 7 August

Some sheep farmers dear that scab has been introduced by sheep travelling from Wellington, though so far no actual case has been reported.  There is a flock at Anlaby afflicted with Coast Disease and they have been detained for ten days to ensure they are not infected with scab.

The election was rather more exciting in Burra than is usual.  Mr Crozier’s committee was active and so were speakers for the other candidates.

Princess Royal Mine continues to attract interest.  Sixty tons of ore are at the Smelting Works – principally the produce of 15 men who raised it in the last ‘take’ of two months.

At the Burra Mine about 220 men are at work.
