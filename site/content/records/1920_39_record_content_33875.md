Ayers School Parents Meeting reported on the end of the biennial period.  Ayers School opened four years ago and has a present enrolment of 30 with good attendance.  In the last two years promotions matched enrolments to within one or two.  A new shelter shed had been erected in the last two years.  Miss Crowhurst gave an interesting talk on educating children on morals in life and on discipline etc.  A new committee was then elected: Chairman, R.W. Humphrys (re-elected); Secretary & Treasurer, Mr J. White.
