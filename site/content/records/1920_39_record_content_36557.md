Burra Public School broke up on 18 December when the classes had parties.  This year the school had been affected by chicken pox and more lately by whooping cough.  A drum & fife band had been formed.  The Qualifying Certificate exam saw 12 of the 13 candidates succeed and the one failure may be attributed to illness.

The depression has caused many of the children to be insufficiently nourished and poorly clothed.  In winter several children were crying with the cold.  Since 3 September needy children have been supplied with hot soup or cocoa at noon â€“ an average of 25 children a day.

If more people can come forward with assistance this will be continued next year.

Exam results are printed.  [Personal interest: Ted. Fuss was 2nd in Grade VI with 95%.]

Qualifying Certificates were gained by:

Florrie Thomas	591	Ron Hirschausen	526	Albert Sampson	522

Joyce McDonald	505	Ron Kellock	502	Lawrence Walker	484

Arthur Woollacott	446	Dorothy Parker	439	Mavis Jesser	409

Jim Parks	397	Edith Heinrich	371

[If 12 passed as stated above, one name is missing.]
