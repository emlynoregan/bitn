Kooringa, 26 October.

Anniversary services for the Kooringa Wesleyan Church were held on Sunday 17 October.  Rev. R.W. Campbell preached in the morning and evening and Rev. S. Gray (Primitive Methodist) in the afternoon.

Attendance was good, but at the tea on Tuesday in the schoolroom attendance was very small due to the rain.

Dr Stephens presided at the public meeting.  He has recently arrived from America.  On the next afternoon the Institute was provided with a magnificent spread and the weather being fine, the attendance was large.  After the tea Rev. S. Knight gave his lecture on The Anglo Saxons.  [Other contributors to the entertainment are listed.]

[This report seems a little confused.  Presumably Dr Stephensâ€™ meeting was on Monday, as the usual practice was to hold a tea-meeting the day after the anniversary services.  The Tuesday tea is not explained.]
