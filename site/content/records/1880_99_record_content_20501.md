Charles Morgan, a painter of Redruth, was in Schutz’s cab. At Vivian’s Hotel (Opie’s) Cosgrove was waiting with his coat off and said he wanted a fight.  Schutz said he did not as he would lose his licence.  They moved out of Morgan’s sight and by the time he had got out of the cab Cosgrove was on the ground.

Edward Bourk, labourer, gave evidence substantially corroborating this.

Thomas Cosgrove’s evidence also confirmed much of it except for the engagement of Bill the Tinker.

The information against Schutz was then withdrawn and Cosgrove was fined 10/- + 20/- costs.
