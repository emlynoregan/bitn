Major Margaret Garratt was born at Burra and became part of the Salvation Army because her parents and maternal grandparents were members.  She joined the Army aged 11 before moving to Adelaide.  Her parents were Wilf Garratt & Ruth nee Aberg.  [There is no obvious reason for this snippet.  Aberg & Sons opened a butcher shop in Burra in 1933 and Ruth Aberg married Wilfred Garratt in 1935.]
