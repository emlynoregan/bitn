Editorial on Municipal Matters.

The Council’s decision to inflict the full £50 penalty on accepting the Mayor’s resignation is, we believe, without a parallel.  In almost every such case the penalty has been limited to the cost of the election, or remitted altogether.  It was a nonsense to say the fine must first be imposed as the Act gives the Council power to do as it pleases.
