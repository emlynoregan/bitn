Timothy O’Loghlin, brother of the deceased, said he had been working with his brother for about a week.  His brother had then been away at Mt Bryan Hotel for four days and returned with a bottle of gin.  The witness gave his evidence in an incoherent manner and at this point fainted or had a fit.

Owen Cronin, a labourer of Middle Camp, said he had been working with the deceased.  He told of drinking with the deceased at the Mt Bryan Hotel and of returning with him.  He said deceased had brought a bottle of gin with him.  About 1 p.m. on Friday he had gone from O’Loghlin’s tent to his own and at 2 or 3 p.m. Timothy O’Loghlin had informed him of his brother’s death.  He then went with Tom Moroney and the cook and saw deceased lying on his side in the bunk, dead.  There had been no quarrel and he had heard no angry words.

‘Was at the Burra on Tuesday, and rode in a spring-cart to Mount Bryan, but do not know if the deceased was with us.’

Thomas Moroney, stone-cutter of Middle Camp:

Deceased had been working with me.  Saw him at Mt Bryan Hotel on Thursday in good health.  He took a bottle of square gin away.  He was then apparently sober.  At about 10 p.m. had a drink with him in his tent.  Deceased then seemed healthy and sober.  On Friday morning about 6 or 7 a.m. saw him at the door of his tent on his hands and knees with his back bent up.  I and his brother put him in his bed, alive, but breathing heavily.  Stayed an hour and then went to my own camp.  Only thought he was like I had seen him many times before.  His brother came to my tent about 2 p.m. and deceased was then dead and stiff.  Deceased was in the habit of drinking.  When I called at 10 o’clock Timothy O’Loghlin was not sober.  Do not believe there is the least suspicion of foul play.

Patrick Gillespie, clerk to Mr Terry, mail contractor told how he had driven the deceased, his brother and Owen Cronin and a man called Barry, from the Court House Hotel to Middle Camp.  They had drunk heavily on the way and the deceased had been very drunk.  On the way Timothy O’Loghlin had informed him that he had come in to take his brother out, as he was on a spree.

Constable Farrell gave evidence of going to see the body.

The verdict was ‘That the deceased had been drinking heavily for some time past, and that death was caused by excessive drinking.

The Burra correspondent of the paper commented on a recent comment in the Register that there were many drunken men to be seen about the townships of Burra.

‘The high wages now being earned unhappily in many cases only lead to foolish workmen having more money to spend, to more time being occupied in the spending of it, and to less work being done in consequence.’

The rest of the correspondent’s comments concerned the police.  The constable had to seek special permission to go to Middle Camp because of the understaffing of the Burra police.  The Burra police arrangements have been in a chronic state of chaos for some time and are the subject of a constant battle between the Government and the Burra Council.  There is a police station at Kooringa and one at Redruth.  Half the cost of the Kooringa constable is met by the Council and he is confined to keeping order in the town.  At Redruth there is a mounted constable and a foot constable.  Until recently the duties of the latter have been multifarious.  Half his cost is also charged to the Council and he has a horse provided.  This means that he has at times undertaken duties that should be assigned to the mounted constable.  This has resulted in the Council saying that if that is the case then his salary should be charged to general revenue.  After a long delay the Government has limited his duties to the townships.  This resulted in a second trooper being stationed at Redruth, but just when his services were needed, he had been removed without a replacement.  Comparisons with other places, like Clare, where no local contribution is called for, suggest the Government has been very rough on the Burra Council.

[Thomas O’Loghlin died 20 November 1874 at Mt Bryan Flat aged 50.]
