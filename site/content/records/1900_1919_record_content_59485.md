Burra Show Society Annual Report.

The report began with thanks for the end of the war.

Agriculturally the season began well, faltered and ended satisfactorily.  The year for pastoralists was again good with a big lambing and big wool clip.  Wool prices and stock prices held up.  Fires had been a major down side for the year for some producers.

The loss of H.H. Thomas as a hard worker for the society who had died this year was an untimely blow.

Membership this year was 208 – up from 178.

Improvements for the year.

The biggest was the erection of 150 permanent fowl coops.  The show ring was moved to the north of the permanent ring, making it more central and giving an opportunity for events to be seen from traps and cars.

The sheep show was a dismal failure with only one competitor.

The dog trial was a great success.

The general show on 22 October was very successful despite being unpleasantly windy.

Financially the Society began the year £70in credit and ends it £30 in debt.

The Burra Brass band aided the show by its presence and thanks was also extended to the ladies who assisted, especially those of the Soldiers’ Aid Soc. For the luncheon and afternoon tea.  Thanks also to the Boy Scouts and the committee.
