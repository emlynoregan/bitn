The Burra District Swimming Club & Burra Football Club have been granted use of the Burra Town Hall on 30 August and 4 October and pictures will be cancelled on those nights.  Some people argue that the pictures are run at a loss and the hall could be let more often for other functions.  Picture attendances have improved somewhat since the hall modifications have been completed.  There are at present no intentions to further disrupt the pictures.
