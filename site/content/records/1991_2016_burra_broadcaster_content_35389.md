Weather.  Storms lashed the district in the past week with falls of up to 6 inches [152 mm]  Burra Creek has been running a banker producing erosion and washaways.  Out east it filled most dams.  The Council requests that only essential traffic use the eastern roads as many of them are in bad repair, especially at creek crossings.  A tree blocked the highway at the entrance to the town from Adelaide and a small number of homes in the Best Place area were flooded.  The door to the Royal Exchange bar was sandbagged as a precaution, as were a couple of houses in Tregony Street and a tarpaulin was needed for a roof of a house in Ludgvan Street.
