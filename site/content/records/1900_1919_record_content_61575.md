Kooringa Tennis Club.  Met on 19 August and elected:

Patron		Mr George Sampson

President	Dr D. McDonald Steele

Captain		Rev. G.K. Haslam

Vice-Captain	Miss D. Crewes

Secretary	Mr W.N. Langsford

Treasurer	Mr F. Streicher

Currently there is one earth court near the old Bible Christian Church where the Kooringa Methodist Church formerly had two and the Kooringa Club one court.  The property passed into George Sampsonâ€™s hands and he turned it into a poultry farm for a while.  Dispensing with the poultry and hearing the tennis club was to be reformed he placed the property at their disposal at a fair rental.  He has now agreed to put down two asphalt courts at his own cost, giving the club three courts, well fenced and in a central location.
