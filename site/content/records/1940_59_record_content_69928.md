Avis Stockman has now won the Australia-wide ABC broadcasting competition for girls of Rural Youth and Young Farmer Clubs at the Royal Melbourne Show. This seems to be the first time that a South Australian has been the winner.  The first prize was a Phillips Mantle Radio.  While staying in Melbourne contestants were guests of the ABC at the Victorian Private Hotel and were chaperoned by Mrs W. Simpson.  There were several visits to the show and to films as well as to the Town Hall, the Olympic Games site and the Melbourne Botanic Gardens.
