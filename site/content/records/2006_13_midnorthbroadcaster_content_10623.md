Mount Pleasant Development.  A development proposal would allow a highly visible storage facility at the rear of 23-25 Commercial St.  If approved it would be one of the most visible and bulkiest buildings in central Burra.  Some local residents have raised objections both because of the intrusive appearance of this proposal and because it sets a precedence.
