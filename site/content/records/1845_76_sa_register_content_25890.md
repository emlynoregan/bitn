A Trip Through the Northern Areas

[The writer describes rather discursively the road from Caltowie to Jamestown; being bothered on the way by the impact of new fencing, which sometimes caused diversions or even blocked the way.]

Jamestown is the most easterly town of what may be called the Pt Pirie group and yet it is not entirely of that group; its mail comes via Burra as do many of its supplies.  I was wakened at a rather too early hour at Jamestown by the steam whistle of the busy flour mill.  The township has an abnormally wide main street, which gives an undeservedly desultory appearance to the town; an appearance that should change when the impending District Council is instituted.  Otherwise Jamestown pleased me better than the other two towns I had seen since leaving Clare, and if I am not mistaken it has a prosperous future.  At present it has two hotels, stores and duplicate saddlers, butchers, bootmakers, etc. It has also a well-qualified medical practitioner and insurance agents.  The site seems to me to be rather too flat and a range of nearby low hills would have been a better location.  Surveyors are busy cutting the original 40-acres ‘suburban’ blocks into allotments of 10 and 11 acres.  [The writer digresses then for some time to discuss the uselessness of 10-11 acre blocks.]

A block of land a few miles south of Jamestown has been selected by the Government for a forestry reserve.

[From Jamestown the writer went to Laura and thence returned to Pt Pirie, during which he came across the unexciting signs of the initial work for the Pt Pirie-Gladstone railway; a few miles of earthwork at present beginning nowhere and ending in nothing.  He had more respect for ‘the Dam’ that was to serve Pt Pirie.]

[Continued 28 September.]
