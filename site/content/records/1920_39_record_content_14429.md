Tennis.  The opening of the new tennis courts at Redruth, adjacent to the playground on Smelts Road.  Of the four courts, two are completed and two nearing completion.  The opening was by the Mayor, Mr M. Collins.  The President, Mr M. Morton welcomed guests.  The two earth courts previously used had become unfit for play two years ago and they had used Mr J. Reed’s private grass courts for 1½ seasons.  They were fortunate to secure the present court area of 240’ x 120’ on a 99 year lease from the Council.  The total cost of the four courts would be £177-4-6.  They had an overdraft of £67 and when free of debt would have a court put down for younger boys and girls.  The Mayor, in opening No. 1 court, announced that I. J. Warnes had agreed to pay the overdraft up to £100.  Mr M. A. Radford opened No. 2 court.
