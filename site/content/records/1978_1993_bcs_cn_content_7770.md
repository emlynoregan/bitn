ABC TV was filming a segment profiling the SA Leader of the Opposition John Olsen recently when he was attending the opening of Paxton Square Cottages.  As a consequence Burra will get a brief exposure on the ‘4 Corners’ program to be screened next Saturday at 7.30 p.m.  [A follow-up reference suggests a very brief exposure indeed.]
