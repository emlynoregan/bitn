Mary Woollacott writing in her ‘Over the Fence’ gossip column mentions that the ‘Mrs Maggs’ gossip column of the 1960s was written by Mrs Joan Watts, wife of a then local policeman.

Anne Field, daughter of Beth Field of Burra, graduated recently at Armidale NSW as a Bachelor of Education.

Greg Secomb has a job at Strathalbyn as an agronomist with Vivco.

Ron Shipard & Chris Reed are retiring from Burra Burra DC this week after some years on that body.

Nigel Hallett, a descendent of one of the founders of the town, will open the local history room at Hallett on 30 April.
