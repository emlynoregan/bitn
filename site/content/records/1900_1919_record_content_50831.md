E.E. Thamm writes concerning the disgraceful scene recently in the Redruth Church.

He denies he was signalled by Mr Tiver to sing, neither was he knocked into the aisle, nor was he forcibly expelled from the church.  He admitted to bowing while the National Anthem was sung.  He was pushed ‘a little off his equilibrium’ and then joined in the last bar of the anthem.  He was leaving with his wife when someone unknown to him suggested he leave – probably fearing an altercation with Brother Tiver.

[Mr Thamm does not actually say why he was not singing the National Anthem in the first place, but does say there was no harm in holding his tongue while an appeal was made to God on behalf of the King, implying less than fulsome agreement with the sentiments expressed.  He seems also to agree with the sentiments of one observer that singing the words really signifies little unless you mean them.  The letter is interesting because of the marked German accent that comes through in the writing.]
