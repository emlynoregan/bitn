Mintaro News, 12 November

The large bonfire to honour the visit of HRH was located on top of Mt Rufus, from which it would be visible for up to 40 miles.  Some ill-disposed person set it alight on the Friday previous to the princeâ€™s arrival.

The principal residents went to Adelaide for the celebrations.  Those who remained lit bonfires, fired guns and let off fireworks.

Residents are endeavouring to form a District Council to be called the District of Stanley.
