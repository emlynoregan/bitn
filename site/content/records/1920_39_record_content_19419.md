Bowling Club.  The close of season was held on Saturday 8 May.  The president, Mr M. Collins, said the season had been very successful aided by the installation of electric light on both greens at a cost of £70-£80, which had been defrayed.  Finances were better than last year.  There was some thought of enlarging their borders, but he thought they should first pay off their overdraft.  Prizes:

Croquet

Lady Champion		Mrs J.G. Sara

Handicap Trophy		Mrs W.H. Tiver

Doubles			Mrs W. H. Sandland & Mrs P.L. Rosman

Beginners’ Trophy	Mrs P.L. Rosman
