Mt Bryan East, 8 March.

The harvest is over and most of the grain is bagged.  Owing to smut, half-heads, locusts and rabbits, the yield is less than some farmers had hoped.  The crop varied from 10-19 bushels per acre.  Many are calling for a Bill compelling landowners to destroy rabbits.

The Mt Bryan DC seems to be dormant, as we hear nothing of their doings, although so near.
