Mr Hawkes said something had to be done about the Isolation Ward.  It was an abomination and a veritable death trap: like a camp oven in summer and an ice-chest in winter.  It was an iron structure.

Mr Warnes moved the Government be written to pointing out to them that the Board felt it endangered the life of any patient placed in it.
