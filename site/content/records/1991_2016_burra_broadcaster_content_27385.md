Stage 1 will see reception and office facilities in the RSL room and the former Civic Centre and the construction of ramps and toilet facilities for those with disabilities.

Stage 2 will include the demolition of the present offices and creation of a new meeting venue and reception area.  The sixteen week project is to commence on 18 March with council meetings off site for the duration.
