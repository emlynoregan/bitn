W.H. Anderson, who has been with the local telephone department for 7½ years, left Burra last Saturday.  He is using his long service leave to make a trip to England. His wife, who comes from England, went there about six months ago.  He has been respected in his time here as a courteous, sympathetic and obliging officer.  He was given several send-offs.  On 8 March after the service at St Mary’s he was presented with a collapsible deck chair.  On Friday evening in the Council Chamber the Mayor, T.H. Woollacott, chaired a meeting of citizens at which Mr Anderson was presented with a travelling rug.  Mr B. Cornelius as acting postmaster endorsed the Mayor’s remarks.  W.F. Pickering of the National Bank spoke for the business men of the town and was supported by H.N. Potter, N. Hann and A.L. Bence.  Mr Anderson responded and introduced his replacement, Mr Drayton.  St Mary’s Sunday School, of which Mr Anderson was the Superintendent, presented him with a diary, and the post office staff gave him a pipe and Morocco tobacco pouch along with a book from the telephonists.
