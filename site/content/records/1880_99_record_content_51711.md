Railway Accident.

Wednesday 8 November.  A shocking accident occurred last night.  A ballast train from the quarry ran over Mr & Mrs Foy as it emerged from the quarry.  They were taking a short cut along the road over which the line is erected.  Mr Foy was knocked over without significant injury, but Mrs Foy has lost her left leg and part of her right foot and remains in a precarious condition.  The driver applied full brakes and blew the whistle, but the pair took no notice.  The train pulled up just as the accident occurred.

[Note that this account is nothing like that given at the inquest, see XV, 272, 29 Nov. 1893, page 3, where it is said the train was coming from the station to the quarry and the impact occurred on the bridge over the Burra Creek.]
