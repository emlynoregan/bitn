Market Square & Best Place Redevelopment Plans

Public feedback has been divided, but now a groundswell of opposition seems to be growing.  A petition has been initiated that includes the names of two of Burra’s Councillors; Peter Reilly and Adrian Gill.  A major concern seems to be the reduced number of parking spaces in front of the Burra Hotel and the cost of a project when people are satisfied with the present layout.  The nearness of the rotunda to the road in the new plan has also been cited as a concern.  Peter Reilly says a number of people fear the cost will simply be an excuse to jack up rates further.  Council decided to go ahead with the plan last year.  Once final details are decided the redevelopment will be put to consultation again.  Stage 1 was to assess how design could improve commercial and residential use of public space.  Stage 2 was to plan and prepare tender documentation.  Stage 3 is to do the work.  Council has been sufficiently impressed with the concept that they were willing to match Government funding to carry it out.  Architects Hames Sharley say that the current design provides for 78 car parking spaces and the new design for 73.  At a public display last year of three concept plans for Market Square, the one incorporating a car parking lane and two-way traffic on the Burra Hotel side of the square gained most favourable comment.  That plan was then further developed into the master plan presented to Council on 28 July 2004.  Market Square was changed to its present layout in the 1908s – previously traffic followed the curve of the buildings closely.  There was serious opposition to the 1980s changes, culminating in protestors lying in front of machines.
