Burra and Its Peculiarities: Chapter 1

[The author is surprised that when a local Burra paper appeared the name ‘Burra’ was not in the title.  The Northern Mail was a name he associated more with Clare.

He says ‘Burra Burra’ interpreted in Austral-Anglo language is ‘Scratch-em-hole, Scratch-em-hole.’

‘A peculiarity indeed! It is funny.’

[According to G.H. Manning Place Names of SA the name Burra Burra is derived from early shepherds who used the ‘Hindoostanee’ term meaning ‘great-great’ and applied it to the creek.  He also mentions an alternative view that it derives from a Shetland Islands term ‘Burra’ for a fortified Hill.]

He continues, to say that Burra has been officially used for the District and now for the Burra Town [i.e. in the name for the Corporation.]  He suggests the editor grabs the name for use before a rival does so.  It is important, he argues, that there be a Burra Herald or at least a Burra Something as opposed to a Kooringa Something.

‘Let them boil and bury Kooringa as a name.’

He agrees that locally it is not necessary to say Burra, ‘but for English, bush and district places, it is necessary to add that all communications from Kooringa, Aberdeen, Redruth, Princess Royal, Lostwithiel, Hampton, Princetown (I cannot complete the list), are all the one place, “Burra.”’]
