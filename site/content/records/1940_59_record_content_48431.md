Fire.

The huge fire to the east has turned out to have resulted in only slight stock losses, contrary to expectations.  The sheep were in good condition and able to move well.  Hurried mustering saw most survive.  Fire is still burning on Canopus and patrols are still watching Lord’s Well and Morgan Vale.

Losses:

Quondong	150 square miles or nearly half the property, 60 miles of fencing, 200-300 sheep

Oakbank	150-200 square miles, most fencing, small stock losses

Canegrass-Yubalia	100 square miles (c. half of Canegrass proper,) 60-80 miles of fencing, very small stock losses

Morgan Vale	130 square miles, fencing, but few if any sheep

Pine Valley	hardly touched

Parcoola	30-40 square miles, 18-20 miles of netting fence, few if any stock

Balah	Hideaway Scrub of up to 100 square miles

Oakvale	still burning with the army relieving

Lord’s Well	50-70 square miles, no stock losses to date

Bungunnia	50 square miles and fencing
