21 June 1979

Burra District Advisory Committee received and considered two reports.

The Burra Conservation Study Summary outlines recommendations for Council action and lists special tasks for Council to do in three sections ranked for urgency.  A list of historic sites to be restored and others to be acquired is also included.

This will be submitted to Burra Burra DC so it can inform the Committee of its own plans for action.

The Needs Assessment Follow-up Report contains recommendations for action to meet priority needs indicated by the assessment task group.

The Advisory Committee is proceeding to initiate and support the recommendations whenever possible.
