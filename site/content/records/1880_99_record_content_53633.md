G. Alfred Maggs wrote a letter in reply to ‘One of the People’ on the question of New Australia.  The letter quotes more favourable reports from Paraguay from the Register of 7 April and the Advertiser of 11 April and makes an attempt to state the movement’s principles in a more favourable light.

‘One of the People’ writes on the role of ‘ability’, saying success comes not merely from land, labour and capital, but that ability is vital.

‘A Working Man’ writes to ask why the workingmen’s blocks near Burra are not open for selection.  Tenders were called and then silence – the area is well suited – along the creek northwest of the Burra Railway Station.

The editor undertakes to investigate the cause of the delay.
