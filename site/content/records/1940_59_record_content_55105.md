Burra Hospital.  A £25,000 Hospital Appeal will shortly be launched.  Plans for a complete new hospital block were abandoned in December due to the impossibility of raising the sum needed.  Certain improvements are long overdue, particularly proper accommodation for the staff.  The appeal committee formed two years ago has now been re-formed with local sub-committees to organise the appeal.  The aim is to build a Nurses’ Home, which will become part of the originally planned new block.  In addition improvements to the bathrooms and conveniences will be made.  With a Government £ for £ subsidy it is hoped to raise £25,000.
