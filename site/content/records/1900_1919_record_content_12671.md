Obituary.  Thomas Parks, aged 77, died 28 December 1904, at Kooringa.

Mr Parks arrived in SA in 1846 and after a time in Adelaide came to Burra in 1849 with his wife and two children.  Here he worked for Messrs Roach and Roscow as a baker.  He went to the Victorian diggings, but only for 8 or 9 weeks owing to ill health.  He returned to Burra and took up baking on his own account, and then a greengrocery business in premises bow occupied by A. Bennetts.  Though he had been ailing for some time, death came suddenly.  He leaves five daughters: Mrs Dyer of Orroroo, Mrs Ware of Adelaide, Mrs T. Goldsworthy of Adelaide, Mrs A. Bennett of Burra and Mrs R.D. Pascoe of Burra.  There are three sons: Thomas of Burra, George of Pt Pirie and Charles of Burra.

George Parks, who is working at the Pt Pirie Smelter, came back to Burra last week due to his fatherâ€™s death.
