Mothers & Babies’ Health Association was overwhelmed by entrants in their Baby Show on Friday.  Sue Bailey as photographer was kept busy.  Winners:

1-3 months	Kerry Whittington

3-6 months	Alan Jacka

6-9 months	Stacey Walkley

9-12 months	Gavin Hirschausen

12-18 months	Jodie O’Brien, Linda Waye, Nicholas Atkinson and Simon Drew

Photographer’s Award for best Baby of the Show: Will Duncan.

Best Behaved Child: Kate Nicholls.

Profits made were a marvellous $350.

The only thing to mar the occasion was the theft of the purse of the President Mrs Peter McDowell.  It contained a large sum and has not been recovered.  Donations from friends made up over half the amount, for which kindness she is very thankful.
