J150 Burra Mine Model

A team of ‘plasterers’ is needed for the next stage of the work on 12 July.  Donations towards the model are sought.  The Burra National Trust is contributing between $6,000 and $7,000 to build the huge glassed-in case around the model.  Pam Marlow has given her time and talents free for about four years of time.
