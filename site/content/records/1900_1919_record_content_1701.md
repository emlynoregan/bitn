Burra Town Council

The Burra Band was given permission to hold a concert at Victoria Park on Sunday 7 October on condition there be a collection and not a charge.

SAMA has granted the use of magazines for the storage of explosives.  Â£5 is needed for repairs to the magazines before use.  [The use of the plural here is intriguing.]
