Football.  At Victoria Park on Saturday

Aberdeen	3.3	5.5	9.8	13.10	(88)

Mt Bryan	2.0	3.1	4.4	5.6	(36)

Hallett 6.8 defeated Kooringa 4.12.

‘Boob. Player’ writes expressing a different view on the game from that of the Burra football correspondent for the previous week.

‘Onlooker’ decries the lack of umpiring skills at the match at Hallett on 27 June, which is an odd complaint to be aired in the paper of 21 June, but 27 May was a Saturday.
