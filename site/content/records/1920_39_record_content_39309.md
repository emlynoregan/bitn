His father the late Thomas Symons Oborn was headmaster of the Grammar school there.  Later his father joined the Education Department and served at Beetaloo and Wirrabara.  Mr Oborn went to Teachers Training College and the university and later taught at Goodwood, Norwood and Hindmarsh before being made headmaster at Elliston and then Streaky Bay.
