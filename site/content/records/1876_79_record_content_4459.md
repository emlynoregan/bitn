The Town Clerk said the sum first asked for by Messrs Statton & Henderson for the last 10’ of land was £200 besides the other agreement for the 30’. Mr J. Beaglehole made a rather confused contribution with references to the past legal costs of the council and the future legal costs too. Mr Kitchen could not understand why anyone would oppose the loan. The state of roads and paths was a disgrace and there was not a clean place to walk if it rained except on limestone hill. They ought to do this for the sake of the town and to get the subsidy. Mr Harry thought the Corporation shouldn’t be given money as they didn’t know how to spend it. Rev. Jenkins was opposed and favoured a special rate. Mr Fogg wished to say Messrs Statton & Henderson had not asked £400 for their land. No, said the Mayor, but that would be the total cost of the operation. A poll was then demanded which was held on Tuesday and resulted in 154 for and 146 against.
