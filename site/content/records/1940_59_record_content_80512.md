Burra Library

In 1957 with the transfer of books from the present CWA rooms, the re-organisation of the library continued.  The cataloguing of books continues.  Early in 1957 we suffered a great loss in the death of Mr A.A. Davey who had been connected with the library for his lifetime.  His death in the early part of the transfer set the committee a large task and many thanks are due to the Secretary Mr P.J. Byrne for handling a difficult position so well.  Membership stands at 110.  The balance sheet shows a loss of £11 – mainly due to re-organisation costs.  Mrs Steer has taken over as Librarian.  Twenty-four student scholarships were issued to school students.
