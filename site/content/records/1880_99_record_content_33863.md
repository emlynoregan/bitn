Crops.  Article of over one column describing crops from Jamestown to Adelaide via Petersburg.  The crops from Petersburg to Burra are very good, but to the east of Terowie rabbits look like making havoc with the crops.  Burra is reported to be dull with several businesses at both ends of the town closed up.  Mining matters are limited to about 12 tributers just making a living.  Though there is a party at work at the old slagheap with a 21-year lease our informant doubted they were making money.  To the east the activities at the Black Hills have ceased and the Joker property is being worked, but so far with no result.  Nothing is being done yet with the fire clay despite much talk.  To Farrell’s Flat it is mostly sheep grazing.
