Students of BCS & St John’s Lutheran School, Eudunda recently took part in an environmental diversity planting day.  46 students from Years 2 to 10 planted more than 500 seedlings at the World’s End Gorge.  The restoration program began in 2010, with annual plantings.  The site had been degraded by unrestricted vehicle access.  [5 photos.]
