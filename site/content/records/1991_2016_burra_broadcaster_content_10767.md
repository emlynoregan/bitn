Burra Pony Club competed on Saturday 6 July at Stirling North in the Northern Zone eliminations.

[Results are printed.]

The Kooringa CoHousing Project will not go ahead.  Four years of work went into planning, getting approvals and finding funding for the project that went to tender earlier this year.  The tenders were over budget and after redesigning work they remained so.  Extra funding was not available and even more so after changes to Commonwealth funding from 1 July 1996.
