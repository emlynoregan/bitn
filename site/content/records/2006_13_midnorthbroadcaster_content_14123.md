Jack Kleinig was recently interviewed by representatives of the National Library of Australia who were in town to document old time dances and traditions.  The Jack Kleinig Band played for more than 20 years in the local area before Mr Kleinig retired in the 1980s.  The NLA has been recording the folklore, music, dance and poetry of Australia since the 1950s as part of their Oral History Collection.  Their interest is not just in the dance and music, but in the dress, the suppers, the types and variations of dances and the stories of the people involved.  Principal researcher is Rob Willis of Forbes NSW and he has been tracking down old performers to record their stories.  Mr Willis has been a collector of folklore and social history since the mid 1970s.  He has regular segments on ABC Radio and has assisted with TV documentaries.  He said the interview with Jack Kleinig was great, ‘capturing many stories of the dance (and other) traditions in the area.  Jack’s stories will be archived and be available to everyone in the Oral History section of the NLA and the material is also available on-line at the NLA site TROVE.http://trove.nla.gov.au/
