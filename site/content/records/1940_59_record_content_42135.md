Snow fell heavily in the district on Sunday night and Monday morning and by dawn on Monday the landscape looked like a Christmas card.   The thaw began about 8.30 a.m.  It was not as cold as last week when the temperature fell to 27°F [-2.7°C].  A motorist from Adelaide said the snow began just north of Marrabel and it was hard to drive to Burra with snow falling heavily and accumulating on the windscreen.  It took two hours twenty minutes to reach Burra from Marrabel.
