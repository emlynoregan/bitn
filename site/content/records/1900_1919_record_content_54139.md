Liberal Union Candidates.  Two names only have been submitted for plebiscite: P.M. Dickson of Peterborough & G.F. Jenkin of Whyte-Yarcowie.

It is rumoured the present members intend to run as independents.

[This is the first usage of Peterborough in place of Petersburg that I have noted.  It and other changes to German place names seem to have passed without comment.]
