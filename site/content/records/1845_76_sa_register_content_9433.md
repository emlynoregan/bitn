Re the Kooringa Election – Mr Mildred’s Committee responds to Kingston’s address.

To the Manly Member for the Burra and all persons whom it may concern:

[The reply pours scorn on Kingston for his sneering contempt of the electors and the personal vituperation of his address.  They defend Mildred’s late arrival on the scene as an indication of his perseverance, energy and promptitude in making the arduous journey after attending assiduously to his normal business.  They were, of course, grossly insulted by the reference to their support for Mildred as a ‘lark’.

‘…and those whom you have grossly insulted and held up to ridicule may then be inclined to believe that your remarks emanated from a diseased mind, and not from a cold, deliberate, and well-disposed member of the Legislative Council of South Australia.’

The resolutions already printed in the paper of 6 October are then printed.]
