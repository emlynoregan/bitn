Obituary.  Matilda Rowe aged 76 died on 5 September, suddenly, at the residence of her granddaughter at World’s End.  She was the mother of Mary, Mrs W.J. Bown of Aberdeen.

Mrs M. Rowe died suddenly last Thursday evening while spending a holiday with her granddaughter, Mrs Percy J. Thomas of World’s End.  She had a sudden heart failure.  She was born in SA on 17 July 1860 and spent virtually all her life in the Robertstown, World’s End and Burra district.  She was a Miss Jones before marriage.  After her husband died 20 years ago she worked for 17 years for Messrs A.J. & P.A. McBride, Mr Reg. Warnes and Mr W.G. Hawkes at Koonoona.  She retired three years ago.  She leaves three children: Mrs W. John Bown (Aberdeen), Mrs T. Duell of Jamestown and Mr Ted Rowe of WA.  There are 13 grandchildren and several great-grandchildren.

[Births, Marriages and Deaths records for this family are confusing.  At her death Matilda’s husband (deceased) is said to have been Henry.  At marriage he was Edward.  Birth records say Matilda Jones was born 24 July 1860 at Pekina.  Her daughter Mary Matilda [Bown] was born Mary Matilda Roe with her father cited as Edwin Roe and mother Matilda James.  The father becomes Edmond when Mary Matilda marries.  When her daughter Alice [Duell] was born the father is not stated, but is said to be Edward on her marriage.  He mother is cited as Matilda Rowe nee Jones.]
