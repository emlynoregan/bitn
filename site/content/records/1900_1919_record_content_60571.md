Ernest W. Brandt, Hon. Sec. of the NEFA writes explaining why a Peterborough football team failed to arrive in Burra on 7 June.  Mr J. Allen, Hon. Sec. of the Burra Football Assoc. corresponded with Mr C.P. Hall on the matter, but C.P. Hall is not a secretary of any of Peterboroughâ€™s five teams, so the fault seems to him to lie evenly on both sides.
