Cr Tiver thought that auctioneers [Cr Sampson was an auctioneer] should be dealt with the same way.

It was resolved the Inspector would proceed against all persons obstructing streets or footways.

Rabbits around Orroroo have been scalped for the bounty and let loose again to breed.  Five have recently been shot without ears.
