Burra Hospital Board has approved plans to upgrade the Casualty and Outpatients Section.  Architects are Brown Falconer of Adelaide and the builder will be selected at the Board meeting on 21 June.  A temporary casualty and outpatients area has been established at the eastern end of the hospital in what was the labour ward of the midwifery wing.  It is anticipated the upgrade will be completed by 21 October.
