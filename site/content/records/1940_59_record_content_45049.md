Murray Water will be laid onto Farrell Flat via a four inch main that will run two miles to the town from the Clare pipeline.  Pipes for the Clare line have been laid out for nearly two years and trenches for laying the pipe were started recently.  It is hoped water will reach Farrell Flat quite soon.  Pipes on the main line are into the Clare Corporation area in Lennon Street, but the pumping plant and storage tank on the Hill River Range are yet to be completed and Clare is not expected to get water until next summer.
