Kooringa News, 11 April

Several people were fined at the Local Court for depasturing cattle on Crown Land without a licence.  The penalty was 5/-.

Mr Bright’s imposition of this penalty under the new Act was appreciated as the Act sets no minimum.  The old Act imposed a minimum £10 fine for a second offence.
