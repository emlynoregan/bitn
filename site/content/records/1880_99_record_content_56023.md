Editorial on the Work of The Past Session.

This is a commentary on Mr Holder’s speech on the subject.

He spoke in his best form for about two hours.

The Adult Suffrage Bill had received Royal Assent.

The editor said ‘we don’t believe the franchise given to women will make one particle of difference to the political aspect of South Australia, either morally or socially.’

The best thing the Government did was to come out on the right side with finances.

The contract of a former Government for the supply of 92 locomotives from Messrs Martin & Co. was a folly.

We are in the midst of a severe depression and it is good to hear the Government is considering no new taxes and that producers will be aided.
