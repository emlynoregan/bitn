SA Mining Association

The half-yearly meeting of the Association was held at their office on 16 October.  As indicated by the Directors in April the operations at the Burra Mine have been confined to keeping water out of the principal workings, to sinking Gravesâ€™ Engine shaft, which is now at 38 fathoms and to dressing halvins and creek ore.  It was hoped the income attendant thereon would meet all expenses and it is now believed that such will be the case for the last six months.  The works throughout the area are in a satisfactory condition and the employment is:

Men on tutwork	15

Men ore-dressing	139

Boys ore-dressing	74

Others variously employed	  27

255
