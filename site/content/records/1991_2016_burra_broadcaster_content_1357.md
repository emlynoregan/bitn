Mid North Screen Printing & Design has been operating opposite the Redruth Camping Centre for 6 months.  It is owned and operated by Rino and Louise Krause.  They can assist with design and concept and supply a wide range of garments for printing, including T-shirts, windcheaters and aprons, as well as vinyl stickers.  Screen printing is a cheap and effective way of advertising for businesses, sports clubs, schools and other community organisations.
