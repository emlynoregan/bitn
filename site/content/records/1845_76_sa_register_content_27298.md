Obituary/Inquest.  G.W. Goodhart JP held an inquest on 24 February on the deaths of Emma Gordon aged 32 and Alice Gertrude Gordon aged 5 who were lost in the scrub on the Eastern Plains about three weeks ago.

Charles Hailes, a boundary rider, worked for Mr Cowper and lived about five miles from the Gordons’ hut.  He last saw them three weeks ago when he had dinner with them.  Mr Gordon was absent.  The family was well supplied with water and had a bag and a half of flour, a bag of sugar and a small piece of meat.  He believed the hut had every requisite.  Mrs Gordon promised to come to his hut on Monday and stay with his wife as his child was ill and he was going into Burra for a doctor.  She had never walked to his hut before, but had walked from his hut to hers.  They could see each other’s houses on a clear morning.  Deceased was a weakly woman and walked rather lame.  A fortnight ago last Saturday he went to the hut and found a note tied to the door saying:

Charley – Mrs Gordon is not here; I fear she is lost; help me if you can.’

Searched for a fortnight and found her on the 20 February.  Gordon found a nightdress on the first Monday.

Every person available did his best in the search.  There were four men from North-West Bend, two from T. Warnes’s and Messrs W. Lambert, H. Green, Phillis, Y. Bosance, W. Schultz, two troopers, Gordon and himself.

It was scrubby country and difficult to find the bodies.  They had passed within 500 or 600 yards of them and found them when they came right upon them.  The mother was about six feet from the child and the dog was lying on the child’s clothes.  It was only possible to identify the bodies from the clothes.  He could not say how long Gordon was away, but he thought about ten days.

Frank Gordon, boundary rider, employed by Mr  Baggs of the Eastern Plains said he left his wife on a Friday at about 5 a.m. and was away ten days.  He was taking sheep from the station to Springbank.  He stopped at F. Baggs’ place with the sheep until Sunday., came into Burra to give notice to Mr Coglin, stayed two hours and went on to Springbank.  The following Sunday he went back to the hut and wondered at his child not coming out to greet him.  He thought they could be out picking flowers, but after half an hour became concerned.  He had told Bowman to call and see his wife as she was timid and he came to the conclusion she had gone with Bowman.  After searching for tracks he went to his hut and left notes for Bowman and Hailes.

[He recounted searching and finding the child’s nightdress and then of finding the bodies on the second Monday.]

He believed she had no reason to leave the hut except to go to Hailes’ and believed she had been going there when she missed the way.  Everything was in order at the hut and there was no sign anybody had been there.  He could not see the bodies until very close to them.  They appeared to have died peacefully.  His wife had never said she would lose herself in the bush and they had parted on good terms.

Mr Sowerby of Kooringa said he was searching five days and he thought every assistance was rendered.

The jury returned a verdict of accidental death through starvation and exposure.

[Emma Gordon died 2 February 1876 Eastern Plains aged 33 and Alice Gertrude Gordon died 2 February 1876 Eastern Plains aged 5.  The child does not appear in SA Births CD and the marriage does not appear in SA Marriages CD.]
