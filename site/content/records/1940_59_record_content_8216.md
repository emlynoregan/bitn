Burra Burra DC was waited on by a delegation from the Burra Progress Association re the poor state of the Farrell Flat-Burra Road.

In September 1939 the Association complained about the road and sought the Council’s support in petitioning the State Government for funds to improve the road between Burra and Farrell Flat.  In October 1939 the District Clerk advised that repairs had been carried out and the Association then wrote again to the Council asking whether they would have its support in approaching the State Government.  They received no reply.  They approached the Premier directly and received no reply.  They then took the matter to the Premier and Chief Secretary combined asking for the Highways Department to act because the road urgently needed reconditioning.  They cited the District Council as saying it would cost about £2,000 to put the road in reasonable order and that this was beyond the limited funds of that Council.  In December 1939 the Premier replied denying that the road was serious defective and saying that sections that were rough would be attended to by the District Council as funds permitted.  The conversion of the road into a loose gravel surface would cost £600 to £800 per mile and there were 17 miles of it within the Burra Burra DC.  An expenditure of £12,000 to achieve this was not presently possible.  In September 1940 the Association again approached the Council because the road again needed urgent repairs.  They cited the approaching works on the Morgan-Whyalla pipeline and said they would increase traffic and damage to the road.  The Association also brought their concerns to the attention of the Premier again.  They received a reply saying that the Government had allocated £1,000 towards repairs to the Burra Burra DC and a similar sum to the Clare DC to improve the section within their jurisdiction.  Mr Warnes (Chairman of the DC) said they had been forced to stop work because of the lack of petrol.

Mr Jennison said that having got a grant of £1,000 for the work, the Association believed the Council had not spent it, allowing the grant to lapse.  Mr Warnes said the £1,000 was part of their ordinary grant and not a special grant at all.  It was some of the money allotted to them for the 1941-42 year and had only just come to hand.  They had received no notification of a special grant.

When asked if it would be any good to rake the matter up with the Premier’s Office, Mr Warnes said they had already received a special grant of £540 to repair roads to the eastwards following heavy floods.  [There was also some altercations about the position of, and the Council’s interaction with, the Clare DC.]
