Inquest into the fire at Thomas Harvey’s shop, Aberdeen.  Held at the Courthouse on Friday last with Mr Ridgway as coroner and A. Motley as foreman of the jury.

Mrs Ann Harvey, wife of the owner, T. Harvey boot and shoemaker etc.:

At 2.45 a boy said a fire had broken out in one of our shops - asked where - found shop full of smoke and couldn’t enter.  The boy W. Gerard returned with the cart about 2.30 and took boxes from the cart and placed them behind the counter as usual then fed the horses and went to his dinner.  We both left the shop and I locked the door.  The boy always carried tanstickor [sic - for tandstickor] matches in one of the boxes.

Thomas Harvey:

Was not in Burra at the time - returned to find the store burnt down.  No idea of the origin of the fire.  Insured for £365.  The back wall was of pailing [sic] matchboard and paper.  The counter was some 9-10’ from the wall.  Stock was worth over £240.

William Gerard:

Unloaded three grocery boxes on returning from Mt Bryan.  One box contained sugar, one matches etc. and the other soap etc. - he described the unloading and said that old bags had been placed over them.  The matches were loose - i.e. in single boxes.  Saw Mrs Harvey lock the door.  Did not get back till the place was burnt down.  Do not smoke.

Daniel Leyson, 14, apprentice at Sara & Dunstan’s:

Saw smoke through the top of windows of grocery store - saw a bag on fire but no flame, but while I was looking a flame appeared.  Told Mr Austin & Mr Killicoat and Mrs Harvey.  The door was closed.
