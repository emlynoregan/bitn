Mongolata Goldfield

With excellent prospects moves are under way to float a company to take over the lease of Messrs P.J. Flaherty, H. Morgan & Alex Bevan.  So far on the property an open cut has been made 12ft x 30ft x 12ft deep and in the centre a shaft sunk a further 10ft.  About 1ft down the shaft is a lode 3ft x 4ft which has assayed at 8oz 10dwt to the ton.  A foot or so further down is a second lode 4” wide, not bottomed, but continued for 6ft and assaying 4oz 5dwt to the ton.  At the south end of the open cut is a lode 8ft high, 3” wide at the top and widening to 1ft showing coarse gold, but not yet assayed.  On the west wall another lode in red oxide also shows gold (not yet assayed).  Another lode had been found in a rock fissure.  An Adelaide company is negotiating to buy the lease.  Mr Flaherty says he has a practical and sentimental interest in the district: his father farmed on Gum Creek 50 years ago.
