The Burra Show was held at Victoria Park on Wednesday last in fine weather and proved to be the best since the society’s resuscitation.  The day began drizzly, but cleared by 10 o’clock.  The gate takings were £70.  Much of the success was due to the thoroughness of Secretary, John McLaren.

Dairy produce was well forward.

Poultry was a highlight.

Stock exhibits were up.

Blood and draught stock were both good.

There were few cattle.

Sheep were as usual the highlight of the show and the quality was better than ever.

Lack of entries caused the cancellation of wood-chopping and shearing.

Pigs were poorly represented.
