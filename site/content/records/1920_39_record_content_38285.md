Charles R. Wright, trading as Wright’s Motors sued L.R. Clarke of Jamestown for £11-1-8 for work done on a Buick Six car.  The evidence extends for just over 1 column and reveals that the dispute probably arose over how much of the fault lay with General Motors and should have been settled under guarantee, but other factors are also involved and eventually the plaintiff was awarded the sum asked for.
