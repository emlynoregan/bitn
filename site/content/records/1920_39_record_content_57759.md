Kooringa Methodist Church and Trust benefited from a fair held on Friday afternoon with the theme of an Australian Bush Fair.  It was opened by the Mayoress, Mrs T.H .Woollacott.  With gross takings of £108-12-3 and a nett profit of just over £102, it was a most satisfactory affair.  [Details in c. 1½ columns.]
