Special A3 sized edition instead of usual A4.

Malowen Lowarth has been found to house a rare quilt.  Jenny Manning, who is researching for her book The Australian Quilters Directory visited Burra on 11 December, especially to view the quilt.  Embroidered on it is the inscription ‘AN to SN 1829’.  Jenny examined it carefully and believes it probably originated in England and is done in a naïve primitive style.  She also believes it to be among the five oldest quilts in Australia.  It came to Burra from National Trust Headquarters in Ayers House, Adelaide about ten years ago.
