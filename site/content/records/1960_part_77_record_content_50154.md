Solar Activity Research Station

A field station as part of a triangle of radio telescopes is nearing completion on the property of Don. White.  The other two sites are at Buckland Park (Two Wells) and at Kadina.  The work is being carried out by the University of Adelaide and will study the outflow of gases from the sun.  This array is the first of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere and the research should last five to ten years.  [Further details in Â¾ column.]
