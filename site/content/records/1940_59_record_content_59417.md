The Coronation Ball was held in the Town Hall on Friday 5 June and drew people from all over the district.  The door takings exceeded Â£128.  The hall was tastefully and simply decorated with red white and blue streamers and an Australian flag on the railing of the dress circle, pot plants on the stage and a framed portrait of the Queen.  Dancing continued to 2 a.m.
