Burra Racecourse Site

Two ideas are floating around about how to improve the town’s sporting facilities.

One schem, which we understand has been discussed by Council involves the purchase from the District Council of the Old Smelts Paddock with a view to damming and beautifying the creek, which runs nearby and turning the site into a sportsground.  Because not all Councillors agree, no decision has been made.

The second idea is being pushed by the Victoria Park Improvement Committee.  This involves improving the surface of the oval, planting a turf pitch and the building of a grandstand, etc.  Either plan could become a War Memorial project if the land opposite the oval could be purchased from the Government and Goldsbrough, Mort Ltd.  The Vistoria Park Omprovement Committee is also seeking to obtain £400 presently held in trust by the Town Council.
