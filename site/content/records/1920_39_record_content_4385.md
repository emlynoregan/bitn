Burra Racing Club AGM on 27 May

The club was in debt over £400.  Although the last meeting made a profit of £19-4-1 expenses on improvements had been such that there was an overall loss of £317-18-0.  The club has no realisable assets.  There is a 21-year lease on the course with a right of renewal.  The guaranteed overdraft had now reached its limit.  Mr Warnes moved that not less than eight further guarantors be procured and the overdraft be increased to £600.  Given the improvements made that were not recurrent expenses Mr Warnes felt they would get out of their present difficulties.
