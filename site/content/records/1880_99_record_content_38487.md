Burra History.  An extract from a letter to England from Burra in 1851 by James Jenkin.

Arrived Adelaide 29 July 1851.  The miners in our party took houses in Adelaide for their families and headed for Burra, 100 miles away.  Those who can afford to ride up, others walk.  At the mines are found shoemakers, tailors, painters, etc.  Burra is a very barren place, very little land is cultivated.  Miners wages are 30/- per week, a smith gets 6/6 a day, carpenters 7/- and shoemakers 7/6.  Provisions were dear, but are getting cheaper.  Flour 18/- a cwt, beef 2d lb and mutton the same.

Sugar 3d to 4½d lb	Butter 1/6 lb	Tea 2/- lb

Apples 1/6 lb	Soap 4½d lb	Salt 2½d lb

Tobacco 6/6 lb	Coffee 1/4 lb	Eggs 1/4 doz.
