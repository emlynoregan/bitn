Burra Radio and Electrical Service

Bert & Eileen Beinke advise that from 1 January 1983 the business at 15/17 Commercial Street will be conducted under the ownership of G.M. & M. Baulderstone.  But the Electrical Contracting Division will be continued by L.A. & E.M. Beinke for a period to allow Malcolm Beinke to recover his health, at which time this division will be taken over by M.J. & D.M. Beinke.

We thank all clients for their support over a period of 33 years.
