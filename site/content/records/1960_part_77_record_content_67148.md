Scouts.  Burra 1st Scouts have been renovating their hall at Hanson.  Seven Scouts and their leaders filled cracks in preparation for painting on Sunday.  This Friday the scouts go to Riverton to see aspects of rescue work demonstrated by the Riverton Civil Defence Unit.  Cubs will meet as usual at Hanson.
