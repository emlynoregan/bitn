Burra Burra DC

Two petitions were received at yesterday’s meeting of Council objecting to the Council’s intention to raise $75,000 for the Town Hall Project and asking for a poll of ratepayers on the subject.  The notice of intention to borrow was published on 9 & 16 June.  The loan would be repaid over 15 years at 7.4% in half-yearly payments of $4,180.67.

The petitions come from ratepayers in the Mt Bryan and Farrell Flat Wards.  The poll has been set for Saturday 1 August.

Break-ins.  On Tuesday night last week three of the five Burra Hotels were broken into and cigarettes and cash were stolen.

Kooringa Hotel: 3,200 cigarettes, cigars, tobacco, matches, a transistor radio and $33.80 for a total value $152.80.

Burra Hotel: $30.

Royal Exchange Hotel: 6,660 cigarettes, tobacco and cigars.

Hotels in Peterborough and Riverton were also broke into.

Adelaide Wool Sales last Tuesday and Wednesday saw very firm prices.  [Local District prices are printed.]

Burra High School.  Three Year 10 students took part in the TV show It’s Academic, which screened on 7 July.  They were Andrew Webster, John Hallion and Stephen Woolley.  Though not successful, they acquitted themselves well.

The Methodist Circuit Rally at Farrell Flat Hall on Sunday attracted 150 people with the Burra Circuit well represented.  Rev. Milton Edwards of Burra conducted the service.

[The headline says ‘International Gathering’ though why it says this is not apparent from the ¾ column report.]

Burra Burra Show Inc.  Shearing shed donations have reached $412.

Burra Women’s Branch of the LCL held its AGM and elected: President, Mrs Ron Pearse; Vice-Presidents, Mesdames Ron Collins & Hamline Treweeke; Secretary, Mrs Norman Finch; Assistant Secretary, Mrs Ron Collins and Treasurer, Mrs Roger Dunn.

Guest speaker was Mr Don Jessop, who is seeking a Senate seat at the next election.  He spoke on the role of the Senate, seeing it as a house of review.  Mrs Ron Pearse as President of the branch reported on the year’s activities.
