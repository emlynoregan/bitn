Letter again from ‘Satisfied’ pointing out that ‘some years ago there would have, no doubt, been a branch of the Burra Institute at Aberdeen had it not been for the manner in which certain parties went about making the arrangements.  From that time there has been a general eruption between the north and south ends of the town, and all caused by a well-known clique, which, I am sorry to say, cannot be healed.’
