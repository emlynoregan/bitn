Mid North Tourist Development Association AGM

Chairman D.E. Wilsdon said tourist was Australia’s ninth largest industry and has the fastest growth rate; but if we were complacent the opportunity to benefit would pass us by.  He reported on their Emblem Competition, won by Miss Eunice Mosey and on the ANTA Convention in Sydney.  Moves to amalgamate with the Southern Flinders Indian Pacific Development Association are reported and reasons given why it was decided not to proceed. Attractions which have been developed in the last 12 months are: Rail Tours to Burra, Swaggie Tours, Burra Mines (old & new), Wolta Wolta, Cumberlandvale, Wineries, Geralka Rural Farm, Motel extensions and the National Trust.  He felt Burra was poised to make the most of its attractions with the Copper festival being an encouragement for further developments, but that Clare was ambivalent, with some residents feeling that tourists may upset their already comfortable existence.  Some people in Clare are ready to act on the area’s great potential, but many are prepared to let the opportunity slide.
