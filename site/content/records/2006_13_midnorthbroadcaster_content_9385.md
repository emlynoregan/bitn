The Ratepayers’ Action Group (RAG) expresses its extreme dissatisfaction with the Local Government Relations Minister, Gail Gago.  The group had written to her seeking a meeting with respect to their dissatisfaction with responses to their concerns from the Goyder Regional Council.  The group says the Minister’s reply failed to address their core request, which was for a meeting with her.
