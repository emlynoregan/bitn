Midlands Wheat Competition this year had record low entries.  Two reasons are given: the extremely wet winter made seeding difficult and subsequent growth was poor.  Between April and October 20-30 inches of rain fell in the wettest season for 70 years.  Nitrates were leached and soils were waterlogged with low bacterial action.  The area sown was at an all-time low.  Competition crops were generally clean, with wild oats the main contaminant.    Local entrants were:

1.	N.R. I’Anson, Manoora with Magnet, Quadrat and Pinnacle

2.	J.W. Burge, Farrell Flat with Quadrat

7.	N.A. Mickel, Farrell Flat with Nawab and Quadrat

13.	C.A. Heinrich, Black Springs with Pinnacle

13.	Reg. Heinrich, Black springs with Quadrat

19.	W. Heinrich, Black Springs with Insignia

25.	C.C. Heinrich, Black Springs with Insignia.
