Obituary.  George Anthony Ridgway died on 26 May after a long illness.  He was the only son of the late Mr & Mrs William R. Ridgway and was born at Apoinga in 1857 and educated at Kooringa.  He learnt blacksmithing from Mr Haskard on the premises now occupied by the Burra Motor Co.  Later he joined the Police Force for some years and in 1895 left to become a partner with his father in their general store in Aberdeen.  He carried this on after his fatherâ€™s death until illness forced his retirement.  He was a member of Redruth Methodist Church and in 1893 married Miss Annie Whitbread of Salisbury who survives with a family of three sons and four daughters: Mr W.R. Ridgway (Aberdeen), Jack Ridgway (Adelaide), Joe Ridgway (Kapunda), Miss Ruth Ridgway & Rhoda Mrs H. Wilson (Melbourne), Nell Mrs M. Dormer (Clare) & Miss Maude Ridgeway (Aberdeen).  There is one grandchild.  Mrs Clark of Unley is the only surviving sister.  Two sons served in the Great War.  [Born 26 April 1857 Apoinga: died 26 May 1930 Burra.]
