C & T Drew’s farewell is reported.  They are leaving Burra for Adelaide.  The Mayor, T.W. Wilkinson was in the chair at the Council Chamber on Wednesday afternoon.  He had known both gentlemen for c. 40 years.  There was the presentation of handsomely illuminated and Morocco bound addresses, the texts of which are printed.  C. Drew in reply said he had come to Burra in 1854 as a boy and had entered into business.  He had always tried to do his duty to the town while looking after his own business.  He had tried to alleviate distress.  He believed it would not be long before the Burra Mines would again be working.  T. Drew endorsed his brother’s remarks.  All his colonial life had been spent in Burra and he had seen good and bad times.  He thanked all for their good wishes.
