Burra Town Council, 19 January

Agreed to receive a deputation from the Burra Brass Band concerning the enlarging of the rotunda at the next meeting.

Last year’s assessment was adopted with a reduction of £14.

Filthy and obscene writings and drawings coupled with names of prominent townspeople have been painted over in the shed on the Aberdeen-Kooringa road.
