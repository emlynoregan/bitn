Midnight Brawl.  Thomas P. Halls jnr and John Kellaway were charged with assaulting PCs Kite and Kelly on race night in Market Square.  M-C Kite of Terowie said he and M-C Kelly saw Halls the worse for liquor with his cab with the lamp out.  When it was mentioned the accused lit it.  Halls then said Kelly was b______ officious and struck him.  A scuffle followed.  Later near Dalgety’s & Co.’s Halls and Kellaway set on Kite and both kicked him when he was down.  Someone came to his aid and then Kite went to the aid of Kelly who was by then under attack.  Halls was got to a cell, but Kellaway ran off.  Kelly corroborated and said Kite had since had 5 days sick leave.  There was supporting evidence from Dr A.R. Caw, Edwin Burns & A.D. McLaren.  Kellaway accused the police of starting the whole thing by using insulting language to Halls and accused Kelly of not being sober and he said Halls was sober and denied ever that night being anywhere near Dalgety’s.  T.P. Halls corroborated the above and said he had just got a pool at a shooting gallery to show he was sober.  Halls’ version was corroborated by Percy Symons and Thomas Wallard of Morgan, William George and his wife (a travelling showman), Donald Turner & William Herbert.  The Court found Halls and Kellaway guilty and sentenced them to two months.  Mr Winnall for the accused asked for leniency and a fine.  The SM consulted the local JPs and agreed somewhat reluctantly to a fine of £5 each and a promise not to be involved in the like again and to pay for repairs to the constable’s uniform.
