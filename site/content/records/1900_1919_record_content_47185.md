Obituary.  William T. Rodda aged 79 died at his residence in Kooringa.  He was a colonist of 59 years.  He was born at St Just, Cornwall 11 November 1836 and worked for several years in Cornish mines and aged 20 came with his parents and five sisters to SA in the Monsoon, arriving in March 1857.  He worked briefly in the Burra Mine before going to the Victorian goldfields, but soon returned.  He went to Moonta with the second lot of men who left Burra and worked there 2½ years before returning to the Burra Mine until it closed in 1867.  He went to Victoria and then to the River Murray where with George Webster he built the barge Kooringa and leased it to several firms.  He then returned to SA and went to the Mt Burr Copper Mine in the northwest and then to the New Burra Copper Mine at the back of Booborowie in company with G. Lord’s father and the late Mr John Lord.  When Burra Mine restarted he returned and worked there till it closed in 1878.  He then worked for many years for Shakes & Lewis erecting sheep and cattle yards in various places.  He was a member of the MUIOOF Lodge for c. 56 years.  He married the daughter of the late George Webster.  His wife died in 1883 and he then lived with his brother-in-law Mr John Harvey.  He left no family.  He is survived by two sisters: Mrs Burns of Moonta and Mrs E. Harvey of Ballarat, Victoria and one brother, Mr John Rodda of Bendigo.  [William Tresize Rodda died 7 July 1916 at Kooringa.]
