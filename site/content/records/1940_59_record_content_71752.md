Miss Geake in Queen Street noticed a rustle under the settee in her sitting room on 18 February and then saw a large snake.  It rapidly vanished down a hole in the skirting board, which she then plugged up.  Later she saw the snake emerge from a hole near the outside wall on the footpath.  She kept watch, but was unable to catch the snake.  On Friday morning Mr Hawson-Clark set a rabbit trap at the hole and on Friday evening Miss Geake found a thrashing reptile in the trap.  Mrs Bill Woodman soon despatched it.  It was measured at almost four feet: not a pleasant companion to have for six or seven days.
