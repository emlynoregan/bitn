Baldina Irrigation Scheme.

The original favourable attitude of the Government has been changed as a result of a more detailed survey and report.  Originally for 600 acres, levels show that only 200 acres are available and the estimated cost of £2,000 cannot be borne by such an area.  The area was advertised at a rent of £9 p.a. for a ten acre block plus 17/- per acre for water rights for equivalent of 24” per year.  Seven applications were received when eight were needed to make it viable.

‘The work was not put in hand as it would be a dead loss for the benefit of a few individuals and one of these individuals was a Chinaman.  Evidently the Public Works Department thought that starting an irrigation scheme for the benefit of a Chinaman was something that the Government could not undertake.’  Said by the Hon. T. Playford when speaking in reference to the report.  He also said the following lovely example of multiple negatives: ‘I don’t know whether they should not have tried this scheme or not’. 

The editor commented: we believe the conditions should be slightly relaxed and the scheme tried as then plenty of applications would have come forward.
