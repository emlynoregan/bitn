The Institute suffered this year from the decline in entertainments except for patriotic efforts, for which the committee has made a concession in its charges.  The committee was unsuccessful in trying to get the mortgagees to reduce their interest rate from 6%.  On 1 October 1940 new arrangements with the Burra Talkies Proprietors came into force, whereby the Institute gets a percentage of the gross receipts for the next five years.  It was expected that this would have increased income by £80 p.a., which would have put the Institute on a sound financial basis, but reduced attendances due mainly to wartime conditions have reduced this to about £30 p.a.  All income now barely covers annual commitments and this will inevitably lead to a lack of repairs, renovations, renewals etc.  The mortgage is now running overdue and a new mortgage must be executed shortly.  It seems an opportune time for the Corporation of Burra to take over the Institute and relieve the present deplorable state of its finances.  We congratulate the librarian Mr A.A. Davey on completing 50 years of service.

Vice President Mr R.T. Bowles said the present overdraft was £3,163 and the war was likely to see the income further reduced.  Things could not go on with the present high level of commitments and low income.  Mr Dane pointed out that when the debt was incurred the committee was receiving a bonus from the Government almost double that presently received and it therefore felt quite justified in making the improvements and it could have paid the interest had not the Government grant been cut, causing the present financial trouble.  It was the defaulting of the Government which had placed the committee in its present position.

Calls for nominations for the vacant positions failed to get any response.  Letters informing the Secretary of the Institutes Association and the Manager of the Stat Bank of the position will be sent by the past Vice-President R.T. Bowles and the past Acting Secretary, Mr R.J. Grant.
