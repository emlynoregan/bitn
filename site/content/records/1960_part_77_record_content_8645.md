The Burra Mine Area is to be opened as a tourist resort for Burra by the Director of the SA Government Tourist Bureau Mr P.F. Pollnitz on Friday 17 November.  The Town Council through the Mayor Mr Baulderstone has been working on the idea of ‘selling’ the mine as a tourist area for some time.  A road has been graded around the area so one can drive around and through the area in safety and reasonable comfort.  This provides some excellent views of the mine, the town and the surrounding countryside.  The old open cut and mine buildings etc. provide many opportunities for the photographer.
