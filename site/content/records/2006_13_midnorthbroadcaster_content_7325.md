Burra Stud Merino Field Days

North Ashrose took out the double prize of Elders Merino Capital Champion Ram and Elders Champion Pair [photo] last Monday.  Tom Ashby of North Ashrose said interest in the field days was greater this year than for some years.  There was a lot of interest from NSW, Victoria & WA.  Sales were strong with the top selling ram reaching $5,000 from White River on Eyre Peninsula.  It went to a NSW buyer.
