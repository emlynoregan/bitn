Armistice Day was observed at the Soldiers’ Memorial on 11 November with a good turn-out of returned men that included one sailor, Cyril Sedgman and a large group of the public.

[Cyril Charles Sedgman was born 14 March 1906 at New Aberdeen, so if he was the person mentioned he would have been a serving sailor rather than a returned one.]
