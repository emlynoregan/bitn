Burra School Libraries

Following the success of the appeal for library funds, strong representations had to be made to the Education department to have the promise of subsidies honoured in full.  Upon realising that the general public was involved, the Education Department agreed to honour the promise and books are being purchased to the full value of £2,000.  The Department has also agreed to proceed with the necessary alterations to the library rooms as soon as possible.  The Appeal Committee is not satisfied that, after some delay and discussion, the Department is fully supporting and granting all requests made.  A large proportion of the indexing and cataloguing of library books has been completed and hours have been spent covering books.  The final cost of the libraries will be in the region of £7,000.  The sum raised in the appeal for book funds was £1,100.
