Fierce Electrical Storm Over Burra

Last Saturday night and early Sunday morning Burra experienced one of the fiercest electrical storms in its history.  It started with vivid lightning in the northwest and then struck with heavy rain and wind, which reached a climax at about 1.30 a.m. Sunday when hail also fell.  Lightning flashed every few seconds and the thunder was continuous.  It is thought that a tornado traversed Burra North from about Drew & Crewe’s Bulk Store to Sara & Co.’s shop.  Mr J. Robin’s house (in a row of four) and an empty one next to it lost their roofs and in Mr Robin’s house a chimney fell onto a bed that had been vacated only moments before.  One of Mr Stockman’s sheds lost its roof and one wall, burying in its debris a large number of fowls.  Some damage was done to Drew & Crewe’s Bulk Store and some of the fence at the Shell Depot was blown down.  Apparently skipping over Mrs Reed’s house, it then twisted all the branches off a cedar tree between Mr J. Harvey’s shop and Sara & Co.’s store room on the road to Gully’s Wharf.  Sheets of galvanised iron were found along the storm’s route.  Fortunately the hour meant most people were indoors or the debris could have caused fatal injuries.  One of Mr Stockman’s cows had a horn cut off, but otherwise suffered only minor lacerations.  Lightning could be seen running along the electric light mains and sometimes caused the lights to glow.  This storm also seems to have touched the Paradise area of Kooringa where a side and the back of Mr W. Harfield’s garage were blown out and a chimney of Mr Davey’s residence (adjoining) was blown down.  All creeks flowed freely and the Burra Creek was a roaring torrent.
