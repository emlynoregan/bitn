Fraud.  The police at Craddock [South of Hawker.] will charge members of the Hamdorf family under clause 63 of the Police Act for attempting to impose on Mounted Constables Thomas and Shegog and others, the belief that there was a ghost at their property, the purpose being to devalue the leasehold from the Crown which had become liable to forfeiture.
