Burra Physical Culture and Dancing Club

This was formed in October 1941, since when about 40 girls have attended each week.  They will present a display of physical culture and dancing on 6 May.  This will include ballet work and tapping as well as posing, Grecian Dancing, figure marching and callisthenics.  Between the dancing items will be humorous sketches and popular song and dance numbers.  Mr Darrell Field and his orchestra will provide the accompaniment.  Proceeds will aid the FFCF, Red Cross and the Salvation Army.
