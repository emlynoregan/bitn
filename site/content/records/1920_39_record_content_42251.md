Burra State School: The Premier’s Visit

The pouring rain on Thursday last delayed the Premier’s departure to Mongolata until almost noon and so it was not surprising that his visit to the school was also delayed.  He was due at 3.45, but did not arrive until 4.20.  The Premier was greeted by headmaster Tuck and Mr Riggs of the School Committee and Dr Steele of the High School Council.  He then visited each room.  He presented Beth Haese and joy Bentley with books as prizes for winning an Empire Day essay competition.  After going through the Primary School he visited the High School where he was greeted by the headmaster Mr Haese and Dr Steele.  He said there were those who advocated a fee be paid for the second year at High School, but he did not think it in the interests of the country.  He urged students to stay at school and make the most of opportunities there and on leaving.  He granted both schools a half holiday for the following day.  Afternoon tea was taken in the Domestic Economy School.
