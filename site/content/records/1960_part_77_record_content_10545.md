Burra Burra Show Inc.  Mr Rex. Warnes was re-elected President at the Annual Meeting.

Tribute was paid to Mr R. Fuss, Life Member of the Society, for his efforts in making additions and repairs and maintenance.

Mr Warnes reported a successful show on 7 October 1961 in perfect weather.  Gate takings were £241 and there was £41-15-0 from a ball run by the Rural Youth Club.  Entries numbered 2681, a record.  The tractor driving contest, held for the first time at a country show, proved successful.  Membership is steady, but the financial position is not quite as good as previously.

‘Once again Mr Robert Fuss has been a tower of strength to us with his work.  He saves us a considerable amount of money and is forever willing to keep things in order.  Through his efforts I can report the additions of a Casualty Room and a President’s Room.  Both proved an acquisition at the Show.  Mr Fuss was also instrumental in bringing the staging positions in the main pavilion up to date.  This caused a much better display of exhibits.  He also did numerous other jobs to benefit the Society, including the watering of trees which were presented by Mrs Stanley Hawker in front of the main buildings.  We are proud to have Mr Fuss as a Life Member.’

I regret to record the death of Mr Edwin Finch and Mr John Kellock who both did much solid work for the society.

Elected: Patron, G.S. Hawker; President, Rex C. Warnes; Vice-Presidents, Messrs B.A. Riggs & C.F. Pearce.

[R. Fuss was on the Produce Committee.]
