Kooringa News, 26 January

The Broughton River Mining Co.

A deputation of some of its Directors visited their section at the beginning of the week and report favourably on it.

Wheal Sarah proprietors met on Monday to transact business and to examine some very good specimens from the bottom of the shaft.

The Appealina Mine is sending a mass of native copper, weighing 136 lb, to Adelaide.  Mr Forster thinks very highly of the prospects there.

The Weather in Kooringa has been very hot.  On Sunday it was 92Â°F.
