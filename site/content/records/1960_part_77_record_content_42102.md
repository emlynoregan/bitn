Burra & District Tennis Association held its AGM recently at Booborowie.  The President reported a successful 1967-68 season with inter-association matches against Pt Broughton and Peterborough, in which the ‘A’ Grade was victorious, but the ‘B’ Grade went down.  The Association was also represented in the Country Tennis Carnival at Memorial Drive in January with three gents’ and two ladies’ teams.  Mt Bryan’s ‘A’ Grade won their first premiership in over 35 years of competition.  Spalding had its two ‘B’ Grade teams play off for the shield and Mt Bryan Juniors won their second successive premiership.  Mr L. Matters of Spalding has donated a new ‘B’ Grade Shield to commence the 1967-68 season.
