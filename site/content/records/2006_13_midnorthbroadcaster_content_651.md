They were amazed by the unpreparedness of Council delegates in answering most of the questions.

Snide remarks about the way Oppy’s and Landmark have to offload supplies in the street were unnecessary, given that several other businesses have to do the same.

Above all the condescending and sometimes hostile manner of several Council delegates towards community members was most disappointing.

Teresa Earle also wrote on the same topic, saying she was disappointed by the disrespect and sarcasm shown by individuals from the community and from the Council and by the fact that the questions asked didn’t seem to have been researched so that answers could be given.  She thought it a bad model for children and that the money could have been better spent on strategies for youth employment in the area.

Evan Hawke wrote also – expressing the view that compared with question time in Federal Parliament, it was an emotive, but well controlled meeting ‘with a bit of name calling and veiled threats’.
