Burra Town Council

Cr Harris moved that the fence between Kooringa & Aberdeen be extended to Aberdeen.  Carried.

Cr Walker moved a few loads of metal and gravel be obtained for Livingstone St, Fuss’s Hill and near Lane’s old shop.  Carried.  [I know of no Livingstone St or of anything sounding remotely like it.]

Tenders to be called for enlarging the cemetery wall.

Several councillors will go to Gawler on Wednesday to inspect the electric light works.
