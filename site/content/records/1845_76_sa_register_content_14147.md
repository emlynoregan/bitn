Fire

On Saturday at about 4 a.m. Messrs Warren Bros. Store at Redruth was found to be alight.  A servant who slept with a child in a room next to the shop heard a noise in the store and saw that the corner of her room was alight.  She snatched up the child and raised the alarm.  Mr Warren and Mr Forder and others had also been aroused by the explosion and soon found the store full of flames and smoke.  It was already too late to save the store and efforts were directed to saving the neighbouring tenements, among which Mr Forder’s was in imminent danger.  Fortunately they were successful, though the store was utterly consumed.

A coroner’s inquest was held in the afternoon at the Court House before J.H. Howell JP.

Ann Hall:

About 3.55 a.m. was asleep in a room at the back of Warren’s store when awoken by a noise and saw flames bursting through the roof.  Snatched up the child and fled the room, crying ‘Fire’.  Mr Warren tried to save some contents of the store.  Did not go round to the front of the store, but re-entered my room to save a bundle of clothing and then a box of clothes of Mr Warren’s daughter.  Did not again return.  The store had been closed since before 7 p.m. the previous night.  Did not know how the fire had started.  Never went into the store after it was closed.  Was certain she had extinguished her candle last night and had not been reading in bed that night.

Pearce Rogers Warren:

Was awakened by a tremendous crash in the shop, at the back of which he slept in a detached cottage.  Immediately entered the shop by the back door in an attempt to save the books, but the store was a sheet of flame and he was knocked down by the violence of the flame and smoke.  He had to crawl on his hands and knees and saved neither the books nor any of the stock.  The stock in trade was drapery and groceries.  Kept only a few matches and they were in a tin box made for the purpose.  He had gone to the box the night before and the matches were then safe.  There was nothing in the store that might ignite spontaneously.  The door had been well fastened.  Stock had been insured for £1,000, but their books showed the value to be about £1,500.  The premises were rented with right of purchase and were not insured.  They had only insured lately on account of the danger from the blacksmith’s fires.  Had no idea of the possible cause.  In answer to a question from the jury he said there had been a threat held out to him, but he had not attached much importance to it.  There were debts on the books amounting to about £800, but they had no means of recovering them except from memory.

Police Trooper Hunter lived at the police barracks opposite the scene of the fire, he was present, but could not assist, having a broken arm.  The rest of his evidence is corroborative.

The jury decided the fired occurred accidentally.
