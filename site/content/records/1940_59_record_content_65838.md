Weather.  Severe thunderstorms struck the district last Wednesday.  In the Hallett area hailstones the size of pigeon eggs damaged fruit trees.  Sudden falls of 10 points each minute saw creeks flow and dams get water.  Dust Hole Creek flowed for the first time in over a year.  Falls varied from 40 to over 100 points.  Hallett received 109 points Wednesday and a further 51 Friday night.

The rain turned roads into bogs briefly, but they dried very quickly.  Near Hallett Roger Nutt rescued six vehicles in half an hour from a slippery bit of recently regraded road.  There was also trouble between Burra & Mt Bryan when the creek from Belcunda ran a foot deep over the road and restricted traffic to one lane.
