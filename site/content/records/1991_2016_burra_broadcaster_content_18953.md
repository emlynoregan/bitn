Burra’s 8th Antique Fair brought a very large crowd to Burra for a weekend of fun, entertainment buying and eating out.  About 1,400 passed through the Burra Town Hall and 540 visited the Quilting Exhibition.  Market Square stalls and shops did well, all helped by ideal weather.  Hotels were booked out for meals.
