Burra Town Council at its last meeting resolved to petition the Government to change ward boundaries.  The change was to enlarge North Ward to include the subdivision of Graham both west and east of Burra Creek.  The North Ward is to include the Mine Store and the old Smelts area and all of Graham to their north.  Otherwise boundaries will be unchanged.
