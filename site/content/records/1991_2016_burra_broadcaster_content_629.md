Wildildie, a bed and breakfast establishment 20 km east of Burra, opened on the May long weekend.  Mr Robert Heading, Wildildie’s manager and owner, says he couldn’t have done it without the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme.  He had purchased the property two years ago to establish a business growing broombush for brush fences, but that venture failed and he turned to renovating the old homestead with the aid of NEIS funding as income support.  The home has three guest rooms; two doubles and one twin and the basic room rate is $70 per double per night.
