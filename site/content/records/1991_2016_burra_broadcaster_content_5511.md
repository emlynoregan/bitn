Weather.  Last Saturday Burra and Districts were deluged with more than 100 mm of rain.  Leighton and Gum Creek areas reported falls of more than 150 mm.  Stock had to be rescued from floodwaters.

In Burra more than 25 mm fell in a 15 minute period and the creek past the Burra Hospital flooded down Commercial Street, where water entered premises along the south side from Dollman’s Garage to Elders.  Other shops and houses on Commercial, Thames and Chapel Streets also sustained water damage.

At various times the Burra-Morgan and the Burra-Robertstown roads were closed and the Barrier Highway was cut at Burra, Mt Bryan floodway and south of Hallett.  The SES and DRT workers made a great effort.  [Photos pages 1 & 8.]
