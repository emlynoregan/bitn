Burra Red Cross has an active membership of 18 and an average attendance of 12.  Office bearers elected for the year are: President, Faye Jones; Secretary, Jenny Coatupe and Treasurer, Pat Kakoschke.  The outgoing Secretary Jan Tiver said the branch members were disheartened to find the Baby Capsule Hire facility has been removed from Burra – especially on top of the closure of the Blood Bank – all apparently in the name of cost effectiveness.  During the year Joshua Kleinig won our section of the Baby Competition, raising a very creditable $9,690.  Red Cross calling in March was a success, raising $1,731.20.  A 20-year badge was awarded to Pat Kakoschke and 10-year badges to M. Simpson, L. Ryan and J. Tiver.
