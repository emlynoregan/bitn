Mrs George Terry recalls the Royal Visit of 1920, when the Prince of Wales came to SA and the Cheer-up Ladiesâ€™ Band from Burra went to Adelaide to play for the occasion.  She also recalls the band returning to Burra on the same train as the French General Pau, when the band was ordered to play the Marsellaise at each station.  They were heartily sick of the tune by the time they got home and no doubt the General was equally tired of hearing it.  [The incident with General Pau was in November 1918.]
