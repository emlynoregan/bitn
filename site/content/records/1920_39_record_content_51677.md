James Tiver according to a report in the paper built in 1859 the big iron bridge in Aberdeen known as the Black Bridge.  [This is not true.  The iron bridge in Aberdeen, known as the Redruth Bridge, was built in 1879 to replace an earlier wooden bridge that was in a poor state, having barely survived the great flood of the previous year.  James Tiver may perhaps have been responsible for the wooden bridge or the stonework for the approaches.]
