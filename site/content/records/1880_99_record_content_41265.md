W.H. Hardy writes commenting on John Lewis’s address to Council, calling it a ‘plausable [sic] yarn as long as one’s arm for the purpose of trying to put the ratepayers of East Ward to expense to do most unnecessary work in lowering the ford near the brewery gate, for nothing more or less than pigheaded foolishness.  I might say the story rambled through by Mr Lewis as reported by you is one gigantic garble from beginning to end . . . whilst the latter part of such story is simply false and most unbecoming any gentleman’

‘The special magistrate most positively decided that the course in question was the right of the town, and if Mr Lewis thought the plaint of the Council was “much ado about nothing” why did he not remove the obstruction in the first place and not condecend [sic] to make so “much ado about it?”’
