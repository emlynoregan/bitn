Burra RSL had a visit from 35 members of the West Croydon and Kilkenny Sub-Branch over the weekend.  The group arrived at about 12.20 p.m. on Saturday and were taken to various hotels, before assembling at the War Memorial at 3 p.m. for a wreath-laying ceremony.  A smoke social was held in the evening.  On Sunday there was a chop picnic at the Burra Creek, returning to Burra at about 4 p.m.  The visitors left for home at about 2.30 p.m. on Monday.

The Legacy Club Appeal stands at £139-14-9.

Thirty New Zealand Farmers is scheduled to visit Burra from Friday 6 August to the following Monday.  A tentative program has been developed, with two half day trips on Saturday and a smoke social on Saturday night.  Sunday will be free with the possibility of a conducted tour of the Mine and the town.  The tour is being conducted by the SA Tourist Bureau, the Stockowners’ Association and the District Agricultural Bureaux.

Stray Dogs have injured a valuable Jersey cow.  Dogs have been a considerable nuisance of late and one owner of stock is said to have grown so sick of them worrying his sheep that he declared war on them and has reportedly destroyed 18 of the canine pests.
