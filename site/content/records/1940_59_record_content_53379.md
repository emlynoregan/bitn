George Herbert, boot repairer, is giving up work after 68 years due to ill health.  He began working for Walker & Sons of Burra and stayed with them for 58 years.  Shortly before they closed he started up on his own and has conducted a business for ten years.  Mr Herbert took a keen interest in the town, particularly in its sporting activities and was a good rifle shot and later a keen member of the Burra Bowling Club.
