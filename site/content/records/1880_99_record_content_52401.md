Christmas Eve was kept up on 23 December as Christmas day was a Monday.

There were many vehicles about by 6.30 p.m. and within an hour the town was thronged with old and new faces – though fewer than in 1892.  All the tradespeople did very good business.  Windows were well dressed.  People spilled out onto the roadway as the footpaths were too crowded.  The Salvation Army met at the pump and the Burra Band appeared at 8 o’clock in front of J.T. Walker’s shop before moving round to other locations.  The hotels were well patronised, but no obscene occurrences took place, although ‘merry lads’ were noticeable.  The streets were again deserted by 10.30 p.m.

Christmas Services.  Special services were held on Sunday in the Kooringa Primitive Methodist Church and the usual services in the other churches.

On Monday at 10.30 the Hospital Service took place at the Kooringa Wesleyan Church.  The Town Council, Friendly Societies and the Burra Band made a procession to the Hospital for a carol by the Band before going on to the church.

Special Christmas services were also held at St Mary’s and St Joseph’s.

Weather on Sunday was unbearably hot and sultry, but at 7.30 p.m. there was thunder and lightning followed by a gale and steady rain for a few minutes.

The Band.  At 11.30 the Burra Band played on the balcony of Vivian’s Commercial Hotel and then went on a night’s cruise to serenade a number of residents including the Mayor, P.L. Killicoat.  [It is not clear whether this refers to the night of the 23rd or the 24th.]

Cricket.  On Christmas Day at the Burra Oval Burra 162 defeated Prospect 84.  The visitors stayed at Mr T. Walsh’s Court House Hotel.

Accident.  The only accident reported during the holidays was to a little black boy named ‘Dennie’ who was thrown from a horse and broke his wrist.

4th United friendly Societies’ Sports, on Boxing Day.

The weather was very hot from about 9 a.m.

The day was a great success financially and otherwise.

The procession started at the Institute and went to the Hospital led by the Burra Band, and then to the Oval.  All was well organised.

The race of the day was the Sheffield Handicap over 135 yards, with 36 entrants.

There were 9 heats in the 1st round, 5 heats in the second round and two heats in the 3rd.
