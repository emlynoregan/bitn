Burra Creek catchment waters have been monitored over the last 18 months to identify salinity levels.  The project relies on local volunteers and began in July 2006 with three volunteers, but has expanded to include four other groups, who collect samples on a quarterly basis.  Tests monitor salinity, temperature, pH levels, nitrates, phosphorates and turbidity.  Early trends suggest that surface water salinity is three to seven times that considered suitable for human consumption and pH levels are slightly alkaline, but still healthy for a fresh water system.
