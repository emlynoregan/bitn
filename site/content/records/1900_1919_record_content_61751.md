Burra Boy Scouts Annual Report

The Scouts took charge of the cool drinks at the Burra Show for the Sporting & athletic Club and for the RSL and collected 6,585 pennies for Australia Day and took part in all patriotic processions.  They were inspected by Brigadier-General Forsythe on Violet Day 1918, Colonel Price Weir on Australia Day 1919 and formed guards of honour for Lieut.-Col Butler & Lieut. Colly on their visits to the town and also for Col. McKay at the last Annual Show.  Their annual concerts had been successful.  They had made presentations in appreciation of their help to Mr I.J. Warnes & Mr E.C. Sedgman.  The annual Christmas camps have been a highlight of the year.  The troop has been well represented at the last two rallies in Adelaide.  A banquet on the 14 August celebrated their 4th anniversary.

The Wolf Cubs at present number 18.

The Scouts welcomed home from the war Horton Jennison who practically founded the local troop and they were glad to see he had formed a troop at Mt Barker.

The troop bade farewell to Ina Finch who went to Adelaide.

Last September 28 the foundation stone of the new building was laid by Mr E.W. Crewes.  This building comprises two large rooms, one 45’ x 20’ for Scouts and one 20’ x 20’ for the Wolf Pack.  Mrs Warnes opened the building last February.

Five of the sixteen founding members were present on this occasion and at present there were 20 Scouts and 18 Wolf Cubs.
