Burra North Children’s Playground Committee granted permission for Aberdeen Tennis Club to build a new court exclusively for the use of juvenile players, subject to Council approval and a deputation from both organisations was received.  Membership of the Tennis Club is 70.  The new court will be partly on Club ground and partly on the playground.  It would enable juvenile play on Saturday when the present courts are in use by adults.  Council approved the proposal.
