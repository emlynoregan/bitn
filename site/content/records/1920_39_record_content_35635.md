Harrold J. Button writes that he is now free to comment more fully on the Burra DC assessment.  Something more than mere mathematical reasoning is involved.  Button also points out that Mr Riggs’ own Council [Burra Town Council] has decided to make no reduction in the assessments at all – which he says is truly remarkable in view of Mr Riggs’ attack.  He points out his experience as overseer of Carriewerloo Station, Pt Augusta West and agricultural experience at Wilmington and that the judgement must be on average not based on the difficulties of cases of individual landholders going broke.
