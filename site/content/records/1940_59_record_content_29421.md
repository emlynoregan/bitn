Cr Kellaway has alleged that an attempt was made to intimidate him.  He had been told ‘that he would …be ousted at the next election if he did not carry out the wishes of the ratepayer concerned.’

He had informed the ratepayer that he was not worrying about the next election because he had no intention of contesting it.  He however, was not going to be intimidated into carrying out any unsavoury action during his term as Councillor.
