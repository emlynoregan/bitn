‘A working Man’ writes on early closing.  For several years storekeepers have been closing at 6 p.m. on week days and 9 p.m. on Saturday and have given their assistants a half-holiday on Wednesday.  As a working man I feel that 8 hours a day is quite long enough to work.  We can all help by refusing to patronise storekeepers who persist in opening till 10 or 10.30 on Saturday.  If business demanded such an extension it would be different, but several storekeepers have told me that business after 6 p.m. on Saturday scarcely pays for the kerosene.
