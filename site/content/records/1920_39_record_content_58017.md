The Aberdeen Ballast Quarry

Further questions in Parliament resulted in the Minister of Railways saying that at present there was no work in progress requiring ballast in the neighbourhood of Burra.  The greater part of the broken stone requirements must come from Sleep’s Hill and Yatala.  In anticipation of their being able to make use of broken stone from Burra, the stores branch has been instructed to place an order (provided the price is satisfactory) for 500 tons of Burra stone to be supplied as and when required.
