Utica Copper Mine.  The No. 2 shaft is now at 90’ and entered the lode at 65’ and continued for 15’.  The lode appears to run north-south, dipping slightly to the east.  At 100’ a crosscut will be made to determine the true dip and bearing of the lode.  No. 1 shaft is at 100’ and the crosscut has entered the lode 29’ south of the shaft.  The lode here is 100% wider and 100% more valuable than at the surface. This is very promising.  It is intended to continue the shaft, sinking to 200’.  The lode is 5’ wide at 100’ and growing.
