Local Board of Health.

The Lawn case had cost the Board £45.

Cr Dane pointed out that the money resulted in a defining of the Board’s position.  Lawn & Co. lost, but the judge had said that the inspector had no right to destroy the carcass and in that Mr McBride’s contention was correct.  The mayor said the Board had won because the owner had acquiesced in the destruction of the carcass.
