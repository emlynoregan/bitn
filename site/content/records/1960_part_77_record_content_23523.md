Fire.  On Sunday afternoon a bushfire began south of Clare and burned on area of some 50 to 60 square miles, devastating country between Clare, Mintaro, Farrell Flat and Hill River. A number of homes were destroyed along with many outbuildings and haystacks, sheep, cattle and miles of fencing.  The fire was brought under control in the early hours of Monday morning.  Patrols are still watching hot spots for potential outbreaks.
