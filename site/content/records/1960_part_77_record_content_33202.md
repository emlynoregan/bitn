About 1850 the Karkulta Mine, a few miles north of the hotel, was expected to become another Burra Mine and two towns were laid out near the springs.  One was Glandore [sic: for Glendore] (now known as Black Springs) and the other, right adjacent to the Emu Hotel was Emuville, comprising 36 blocks of one to four acres; laid out by Edmund Bowman.  However, the Karkulta Mine proved a disappointment and today Emuville is just a name on the map.

The other map of 1875 shows the roads under the care of the Midlands Road Board – an area extending from Pt Wakefield to Morgan and from Kapunda to Burra and it clears up much of the doubt which exists about the routes of the early roads.  At this time the main road to Burra was the ‘Middle Road’ via Kapunda, Hamilton, Waterloo and Black Springs.  The other route was via the ‘West Road’, which in a general way followed the modern bitumen road.  ‘Morris Bridge’ on the Saddleworth-Steelton Road was constructed by the Road Board and named after its secretary.  One variation shows that in 1875 the route south of Riverton went through the small settlement of Navan, east of the present bitumen.  The discovery of these maps brings home the importance of preserving such relics before they are lost forever or are snapped up by hungry antique dealers.
