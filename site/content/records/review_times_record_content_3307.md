Burra Burra DC

The new Chairman of the DC is Jack McMahon.  He replaces Cr James Hawker, who has been Chairman since 1981.  Cr Hawker announced at the July meeting that he would not be available for re-election.

Cr McMahon will stay in the chair until 9 May 1987, the date of the next periodical election for the council.

He has represented Leighton Ward for about seven years.  Cr Kellock was elected Deputy Chairman.  Cr Hawker’s resignation was accepted with regret and a motion of appreciation was passed.

In reflecting on his time as Chairman, Cr Hawker said Burra had gone through a remarkable awakening of appreciation for the significance of heritage.  He said one reason for resigning the position was his increasing involvement with the Local Government Association.  Ten years ago he said that the National Trust and heritage matters were low on the list of priorities; now it was assumed by Burra people that the Council should handle conservation and heritage as best we can.  The local branch of the National Trust was one of the most successful in Australia.  Major highlights of his time in office had been the Jubilee grants to Paxton Square cottages, the Bon Accord and Morphett’s Engine-house, the wheelbarrow push and the rise in tourist numbers from 14,000 to 30,000 p.a.
