The Bon Accord Mine

The last mail from England advises that a Joint-Stock Company, which had been formed for the purpose, has purchased the Bon Accord property.  The directors comprise some of the most influential names among the Australian residents in London and include Mr A.L. Elder.  The capital is £75,000 in £1 shares; the liability of shareholders to be limited to the amount of subscription.  A sum of 10/- is payable on the allotment of the shares with a further 10/- that may be called up six months later.  The prospectus indicates that the company intends to thoroughly explore and develop the mineral lands.  The high price of copper and the location of the site adjacent to the Burra Burra Mine present excellent grounds for the expectation of a successful result.  We do not know if any shares have been reserved for allocation in the colonies.
