The Centenary of John McDouall Stuart’s Crossing of the Continent was celebrated at Burra at the weekend.  On Friday evening a small exhibition of items from the State Library and associated with the expedition was opened.  John McDouall Stuart Society President Rick Moore was present and Margaret Blacker represented the State Library.  Mr Des Ross of the Royal Caledonian society was the piper for the arrival of the haggis before the gathering adjourned to the Burra Hotel for dinner.  Others present included three members of the Morse Code Fraternity: Lawrie Wallace (86), Ron Lee (84) and Bernie Matson (73) who were to play an important role in Saturday morning’s re-enactment.

Mr Wallace said the Stuart expedition played a vital role in the establishment of the Overland Telegraph between Adelaide and Darwin, which was completed in 1872, ten years after the expedition.  This connected Australia to Java via undersea cable and from there to the rest of the world.

On Saturday morning the arrival of Stuart in Burra was re-enacted.  Trevor Alderson took the role of Stuart and Pauline Bevan took the part of Patrick Auld as they travelled from the Showgrounds to the old Telegraph Station (now the Art Gallery).  Stuart, ill from scurvy, sent the following message: ‘John McDouall Stuart, commander of the South Australian Great Northern Exploring Expedition, to the Commissioner of Crown Lands.  Kooringa, December 16, 1862.  Through you, I beg to inform His Excellency the Governor in Chief and the Government that I have accomplished the object of the expedition.  Party behind all well.  I will be in town by the evening train tomorrow.’

The party then went on to Market Square where Peter Batten, in the role of W.H. Wilkinson read articles from the SA Register of 18 & 20 December 1862, reporting Stuart’s arrival and reception in Kooringa (Burra).  The party then returned to the Showgrounds where a barbecue was hosted by the Burra Men’s Shed to conclude the event.
