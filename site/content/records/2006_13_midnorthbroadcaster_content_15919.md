Burra Bumper Quiz Night will be held in the Burra Town Hall 16 November.  It aims to raise funds for the ongoing renovations of the Burra Railway Station.  Tickets are $10 per person.  There will also be a lottery with just 100 tickets at $50 each.  First prize is $1,000.  The railway station is an example of the stunning work of volunteer Roy Taplin, who was responsible for the magnificent makeover of the Town Hall.  People will be able to see the work he has done by visiting the railway station for morning tea on Saturday 17 November.  He has transformed the eastern rooms from being full of pigeon droppings and white ants into what will shortly be an inhabitable space.  He has made kitchen cupboards from recycled floor boards and so saved thousands of dollars.  The Burra Railway Station Working Party will host the quiz.  When finished the station will become an interpretive centre for the history of Burra and the railway station, will house a pigmy bluetongue display, and house bed and breakfast accommodation.  Flinders University Archaeology Department and the SA Museum are committed to a display of the ancient mega-fauna of the region and Ngadjuri elder Vincent Copley is working to secure funding for a Ngadjuri Interpretive Display.  The Burra History group expect to have a room featuring the history of the building and the railway.  The Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure are taking over the lease of the building from Genesee and Wyoming Australia.
