The Mayor said the Hon. John Lewis had the right to purchase the Creek, but was prepared to waive it in Council’s favour, if they so desired.  Bagot, Shakes and Lewis desired a right of way for which they were prepared to pay £3-£4 a year.  The strip offered was from the [Kingston St] Bridge to the back of the Mill.  At present the only public crossing was at the rear of the Burra Hotel.  The price is £150 and would be more in open competition.
