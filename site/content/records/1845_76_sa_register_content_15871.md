Kooringa News, 3 September

A trial by jury under the new act took place at Kooringa at the Local Court of Full Jurisdiction last Thursday in a case in which King charged Tyler with assault and abusive language.  The jury found for the defendant.

On Thursday Mr W.V. Herford delivered an entertainment at the Institute of Readings from Popular English Authors.  This comprised selections principally from Shakespeare, Macaulay, Ingoldsby and Tom Hood.

Another entertainment currently in the town is the waxworks showing the death of Burke and Wills at Cooper’s Creek.  The whole melancholy event is vividly portrayed and the exhibition well deserves the encomiums bestowed upon it.  The exhibition will stay till Saturday.

The outbreak of sickness in the community continues and the rate of mortality has scarcely declined.  I am informed that in the last fortnight there have been upwards of 42 deaths.  Last Sunday there were no fewer than six funerals. [If this is true, a great number of them were not registered.  See figures cited at 9 August report.  In fact fifteen deaths are registered for the period 20 August to 3 September.  All were children; one aged 6, another aged 4 and the remainder were younger.
