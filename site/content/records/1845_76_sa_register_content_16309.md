Black Springs News, 5 January.

The 31 December was hot with a fierce north wind and such dust as made it difficult to travel.   New Yearâ€™s Day was cold as if midwinter had returned.  Races were held here for the New Year.  A dance was held in the evening.

On 4 January a fire began at Springbank, which destroyed a large amount of feed.  The high wind on the day spread the fire, which was extinguished after a great effort at about 4 p.m.
