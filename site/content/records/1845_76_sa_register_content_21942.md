Copper is Recovering

Reports from Swansea say orders for copper are finally rising and the economy in general is recovering and wool sales have been lively.  In 1867 the Cornish smelters had closed and markets dwindled.  America had a prohibitive tariff and France and Germany had cheaper labour.  Imports of copper and regulus at Swansea for 1867 were 103,000 tons compared with 129,000 tons in 1866 and 222,000 tons in 1865.

Imports of pure copper rose by 173,000 cwt to 593,000 cwt as a result of Chile having learnt how to smelt cheaply following the discovery there of local coal.  The Continental markets now prefer raw material to the detriment of Swansea’s operations.

Since February copper prices have firmed.  The price of Chilean copper was c. £71 and Burra was quoted nominally at £81.

In March Chilean bars were quoted at c. £72-10-0 while Wallaroo was £80-10-0 and Burra £83.

Prices throughout March changed only slightly, but trade is picking up generally and prospects are more promising than at any time since 1866.
