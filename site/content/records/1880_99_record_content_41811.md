Editorial on The Bon Accord Bridge.

We understand the Playford Government has decided against any bridge to replace the Bon Accord ford.  Apart from the risk to people and vehicles in times of flood the value of stock knocked about crossing the water is another disadvantage.  Every accommodation is made to those bringing stock from the east, but from the west and the north it is very different.  Continued agitation is needed.

[It is hard to see how a bridge to the south of the stockyards would aid those bringing stock from the north!  Surely it was stock from the east and stock using the Copperhouse road that would have benefited and the latter probably already had trouble at the ford between Copperhouse and Burra when the creeks were high.]
