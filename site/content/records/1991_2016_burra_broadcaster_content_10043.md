BCS has purchased ‘Brewery Hill’, a 170 ha property overlooking Burra to the east.  Most is grazing land, but about 40 ha is arable.  The hill was previously the property of the Topsfield family.  A $30,000 development grant from the Department of Primary Industries has been made available for the farm project as well as a large grant from the Education Department.  The Department of Education and Children’s Services has provided a grant of $60,000 towards the purchase.  The total investment will be $102,000.  A parents’ forum this week was broadened to hear from two guest speakers about what was being done elsewhere – Mike Camac spoke about Cleve Area School and Dean Cresswell spoke as Assistant Principal at Urrbrae High School.  Urrbrae has just been granted $16.4 million for a wide ranging development of the campus and curriculum – enabling development beyond wheat, sheep and cattle into horticulture, viticulture, environmental education, land care and associated technologies.  Burra can look forward to developing projects with special focus areas for the farm, such as the use of contour banks, water harvesting, ‘alley’ farming, organic farming, rotational grazing and alternative agriculture.
