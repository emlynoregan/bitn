BCS.  Staff Profile: Rod Davidson

My wife Nicci and I moved recently from Adelaide and I have been impressed by the well equipped nature of the school and the friendly staff.  I am teaching Year 12 Biology and Years 8 & 9 Science and Maths.  After driving 1½ hours through peak hour traffic from Morphett Vale to get to work at Modbury heights last year, it is bliss to walk for 2½ minutes to school from Kingston Street.  Nicci and I are keen Bible students and appreciate the extra time we have to put into that part of our lives.  Having lived on the sea front all my life, I miss windsurfing and water skiing, but feel they are small sacrifices for what has been gained in Burra.  We are expecting  our first child on 30 June.
