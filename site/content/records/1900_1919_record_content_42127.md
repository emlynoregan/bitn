Obituary.  Dr J.I. Sangster Jun. died at north Adelaide Private Hospital on 12 June aged 43, after a long illness.  He came to Burra as a small boy with his father, Dr J.I. Sangster Sen.  He took the degrees of MB and BS in 1893 at Adelaide and then went to England where he was made an MCRS England and LRCP London. On his return he practised in Burra for about 10 years.  He took much interest in public matters and was for a term President of the Institute, a member of the Town Council and Mayor in 1908-09.  He and his family were earnest supporters of St Maryâ€™s.  On leaving Burra he spent three years at Glenelg and returned to Burra 18 months ago to go into partnership with Dr Steele.  He married a daughter of the late G.M. Turnbull of North Adelaide and leaves a widow and three young sons.  A number of Burra residents attended the funeral at North Road Cemetery on Monday.  [John Ikin Sangster]
