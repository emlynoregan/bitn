Burra Hospital Christmas Festival

The hospital was well decorated with countless electric lights on Wednesday night and a large floodlight over the central lawn lent a wonderful brilliance.  Verandahs were gay with bunting and the pillars were bedecked with pines and small flags.  The decorations were carried out by the Secretary, Mr G.H. Dow, Mrs Dow and the house and nursing staff.  Seats were obtained from the Kooringa Methodist Sunday School and the Salvation Army Hall.  Cars began to park in good positions as early as 5.30 p.m. for the 8 p.m. start and people were wending their way to the hospital before 6.30 p.m.  The threatened thunderstorm at 5 p.m. delivered only a few spot before clearing by 6 p.m. for a perfect night.  Attendance is hard to estimate, but perhaps 600-700 people.  Cars parked for easily half a mile either side of the hospital and police aided the control of the traffic.  Patients were brought to the curved side verandah.  G.E. Dane arranged the program.  As well as local talent some of Adelaide’s most prominent artists assisted: Miss Elsie Woolley, Madame Marcelle Berardi and Mr Peter Worth, banjoist.  The Burra District Band occupied a position under the trees on the eastern side, with the Choral & Orchestral Classes in front of the building on the wide drive.  The male voices of the choir were immediately above on the verandah.

Mr E.J. Davey, as Chairman of the Board, welcomed performers and guests.

[The program is described in some ¾ column of detail.]
