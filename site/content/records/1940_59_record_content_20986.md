Easter at Burra saw the town’s accommodation fully booked.  Mr R.A. Bevan stated that with the aid of his new bus (quite an acquisition for the town) he shifted nearly 400 people to and from the railway station.  A large number were also transferred by private cars.  Many people rambled around the old mine workings and a large party, mostly from Pt Adelaide, had a picnic at the World’s End Gorge.

Baldina Mongolata Gold Mining Syndicate, manager’s report for fortnight ending 24 March.

Farnden’s Hill: stoping continued 6 feet to 64 feet.  Country large and blocky.  Values c. 18 dwts.  A crushing is booked for the battery.

Burra North FFCF formed a committee on 28 March to aid the cause of the Burra North entrant in the ‘Pin Up Girl’ contest, Mrs Colin (Lotus) Twist.  They had but a month to raise fund because on 4 May two of the three contestants would be eliminated.  Chairman, Colin Fuller & Secretary/Treasurer, H. Brooks.  The committee has decided on a pasty supper on Friday 6 April and a children’s gala night is planned for 13 April in the Burra North Lodge Hall, comprising a children’s frolic and amateur hour, followed by dancing from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m.  On Saturday 28 April a pet show and picnic will be held at the Burra North Playgrounds.  A ball will be worked up for the final week of the drive.

Booborowie School Committee annual meeting is reported.  Attendance was poor and disappointing.

Elected were: Chairman, R.E. Dewhirst; Secretary/Treasurer, L. Gill.  A ball is arranged for 27 April to raise funds for text books to be used in library form to save costs for parents.
