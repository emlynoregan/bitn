Theft.  Burraâ€™s Town Tour mini bus was stolen last week and later found wrecked after being rolled on the Morgan-Renmark Road.  An 18-year-old male from Adelaide was later arrested in Mildura for the offence.  While the National Trust considers what the options are for future town tours, John Arthur has offered to take visitors around in his 4WD vehicle.  [Photo.]
