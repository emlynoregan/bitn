Jubilee 150 Burra Mine Scale Model

Report by Pam Marlow on the progress of her model:

A contour map of the area has been compiled using available maps of c. 1852, c. 1870 and 1920.

All structures to be modelled have been identified from the 1858 Bentley painting.

The framework for about one fifth of the area has been constructed and preliminary work on the landscape of this area has been started.

Research and trial an error mode has been employed on getting the masonry to look right.

Polyfilla plaster over balsa wood was the basis; the stonework was then scribed into the plaster and then painted.

The paint was made from finely powdered local rock and glue.

Even though the family is moving, I will continue the work, bringing the modules back to Burra as they are completed.

I would like to thank all who have helped; the Burra Burra DC for encouragement and support and the BCS students too.
