Pupils held a break-up on 18 December at Bleak House.  Rev. Wilfred Murphy spoke and distributed prizes.  The dux was Vera Wilkinson.  The prize list is printed.  Numbers were down somewhat this year, but results have been excellent.  During the year the departure of Arthur King was regretted as was the removal of Miss Davidson.  Rev. Wilfred Murphy has been a very welcome replacement for Rev. King and his scripture lessons have been a delight.  Miss Bertha Millar replaced Miss Davidson.  Her dancing class on Saturday afternoons has been an unqualified success.

Annie B. Millar (Principal)
