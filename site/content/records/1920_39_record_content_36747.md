Burra Town Council

H.J.B. Jennison was welcomed as the new Councillor for North Ward as a result of Cr Woollacott’s resigning to become Mayor.  He was welcomed as the youngest Councillor ever to be elected.

[He was just under 33, having been born 30 January 1898 and this makes the claim completely false.  Even without a complete list of births it is not hard to find half a dozen Councillors who were younger when elected – and that from the first half of the alphabet.]

The main road grant available to 30 June was £135 with Council to contribute £65.  This will allow for no new work and only potholes to be filled in.

The subsidy on rates will be £68 – last year it was £210.

The assessment for 1930 was £17,611 and for 1931 is £17,420, attributable mainly to untenanted lands in Hampton and Millerton.  The Town Clerk had found only three persons living in Hampton & Millerton.

Cr Pearce moved the assessment be the same as for 1930.  Court of appeal to be held 4 February.

There was discussion on the Mayoral allowance which for technical reasons could not be reinstated.  After considerable talk Cr Bevan’s motion that the Mayor be given £15 towards expenses incurred in the recent Christmas tree was finally adopted.
