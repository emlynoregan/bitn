OJD (Ovine Johnes Disease) has been detected on Kangaroo Island and the Minister for Primary Industries, Natural Resources and Regional Development, Rob Kerin, has said the governmentâ€™s primary aim is to prevent its spread on the island or onto the mainland.  Eradication, through destocking with compensation remains the policy.  The infection has been confirmed on eight properties.  Forty properties have been tested and another sixty are to be tested.
