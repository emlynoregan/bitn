A suitable battery with building and accessory equipment could be erected for £500 to £1,000.

The Department of Mines has suggested the possibility of a portable battery, but the low cost of treatment will be influenced by keeping it running 24 hours a day six days a week.

One permanent supervisor would suffice if the suppliers of ore agree to supply the labour for the treatment and clean-up.

A good site in proximity to a bore is available nearby.

We believe the development of the field will be better fostered by a public battery rather than by subsidies to individual properties.

Some provision should be made for a water supply for the field without delay.

An increased ration for men who undertake hard physical work in an endeavour to become self supporting and who cannot at the present time supplement their ration from any source whatever should be granted.

The development of this goldfield should be continued.
