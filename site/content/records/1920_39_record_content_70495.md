Grandstand not to be built.

Last Monday the motion to build a grandstand at Victoria Park was rescinded.  At 7 p.m. a deputation of townsmen led by Messrs H.J.B. Jennison and J. McConnon waited on the Council to urge the case for a swimming pool on behalf of the recently appointed committee.  They said spontaneous promises amounting to £100 had been made and the estimated cost was £650 and with the Council’s £400 that left £150, which they were sure could easily be raised.  Cr Dow presented a petition signed by 163 citizens asking for the pool to be built.
