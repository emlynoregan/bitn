Burra Show was held 24 October and was a great success.  The weather was perfect.  Gate takings:

£96 (then a record)

£99

£105

The Cheer-up Ladies’ Band played during the day.  The Soldiers’ Aid Soc. provided lunch.

There were heavy entries in poultry, but lack of coops prevented their being shown to best advantage.

In horses roadsters and hunters were well represented.

Cattle and pig numbers were low.

Flowers and vegetables were fewer due to the very wet winter, but what was there were of good quality.
