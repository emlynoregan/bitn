Fox Baiting has been undertaken recently in a combined effort by The Burra, Eudunda, Robertstown, Northern and Broughton & Districts Animal and Plant Control Boards.  It has been found that farmers who lay baits before autumn lambing commences are recording up to as high as 258 increase in lambing rates. [Sic.]  Baits are laid for three days and then those not taken are collected from the marked sites and destroyed.
