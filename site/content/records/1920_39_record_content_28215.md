Porter’s Lagoon Boat Club AGM 1 October in Farrell’s Flat Institute.  H.C. Atkins presided.  The last season was very successful.  At the sports day on 30 January 3,000 people attended and more accommodation, especially for ladies and children is required.  Of the trees planted 58 gums and 7 pines have survived.  76 further trees have been planted.  There is 9ft of water in the lagoon, ample for swimming and rowing.  The balance sheet was £106-16-2 in credit.  Elected: Patron, W.G. Hawkes; President, H.C. Atkins; Vice-Presidents, W. Carter & E.B. I’Anson; Hon. Secretary & Treasurer, A.J. Smith.  The Hanson DC has set aside the grounds as a recreation reserve.  The club has offered to pay 10% interest p.a. on £20 lease for 21 years.  A 1,000 gallon tank will be placed at the shed and a shelter shed and further lavatories will be erected.
