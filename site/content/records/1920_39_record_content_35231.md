CWA meeting of 22 August

Mrs Warnes reported that the Mt Gambier branch now had over 100 members.  Spalding was doing well and the Metropolitan Branch was active and had a new rest room at Craven’s.

It received a £135 grant from Amy Johnson and the cheque was used to relieve distress of women and children in the mallee.

A Jumble Tea is to be held in Pearce’s Building 26 September.  (Bring a gift and buy a gift.)
