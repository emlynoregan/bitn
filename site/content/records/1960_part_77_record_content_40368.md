Obituary.  Keith Wesley Gare died on Tuesday as a result of an accident [near Balranald] when he was returning from judging at the Deniliquin Show in NSW.  He was born at Burra in 1926.  He received his primary education at Mt Bryan East School and his secondary education at Burra High School and Prince Alfred College.  As a member of the ATC he enlisted in the RAAF as soon as he was eligible by age and trained as a fighter pilot, serving until the end of WW II.  At the end of hostilities he returned to the family property ‘Glenview’ at Mt Bryan East where he worked with his father Mr Lewis Gare.  In 1952 he married Miss Shirley Seal and continued to work at Mt Bryan East until the family purchased ‘The Pines’ at Burra North, when he and his family took up residence there.  The scope of his interests and abilities is shown in the number of organisations to which he belonged.  A president of the Mt Bryan Cricket Club, he was also a member of the Burra Hospital Board, the Primary School Committee and the Burra Show Committee.  He was a keen supporter of the Rural Youth movement and the first President of the Hallett Agricultural Bureau after its transfer from Mt Bryan East and remained a member of the Hallett Branch.  He was a Past Master of the Hallett Masonic Lodge.  Mr Gare employed his wide knowledge of sheep breeding as a judge in the Merino Section of shows throughout Australia, in capital cities and country centres.  Although ‘Glen View’ Stud was registered in 1927, its development to the present high standard was largely due to the recent management of Mt Gare and his interest in breeding lines took him all over Australia.  He travelled long distances to assist breeders and growers in classing lambs bred from his lines.  In 1966 he became President of the SA Branch of the Studbreeders’ Association.  He was keen to have the embargo on Merino sheep export lifted.  At his funeral over 700 mourners paid their respects and with 80 Masons present it was one of the largest gatherings of the Masonic Lodge at any country funeral in SA.  He is survived by his wife Shirley, and children Kay, Lester, Julie and Gregory and by brother Donald and sisters Melva (Mrs A. McInnes) and Glenda (Mrs D. Bailey) and his parents Mr & Mrs Gare Senior.  [Keith Weseley Gare born 29 April 1926 Kooringa: died as Keith Wesley Gare 11 June 1968 Adelaide, residence Burra North.]
