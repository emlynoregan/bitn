Burra Traders’ Association has expressed a concern that the prices and presentation of some traders is affecting the business in the town.  People are going to Gawler rather than shopping locally.  Traders are encouraged to improve their prices and to improve the presentation of premises, some of which have not been upgraded for forty years.  Adjoining traders should opt for a common colour scheme and a display of heritage colours was available at the Council.  Parking was also discussed.  There had been some criticism of the Market Square redevelopment, but the only customer parking lost in this had been illegal parking.  A quick survey had shown that 22 of the parks were occupied by traders and their employees rather than by customers.  The Association felt there was ample parking, but thought employees could be provided with parking behind Bence’s Shop.  This proposal will be put to Council.
