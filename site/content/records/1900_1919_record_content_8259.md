H. Niemann writes asserting that the letter printed in her name was in fact her own writing and represented both her sentiments and the truth.  What she regretted was seeing the Rev. gentleman in such a perturbed state of mind.

On the same theme someone sent in a poem:

‘Wilfred knew a little lamb

Whose face was white as snow

But everywhere that Wilfred went

That lamb she wouldn’t go.’

The editor says there were seven other verses, but this one will suffice.
