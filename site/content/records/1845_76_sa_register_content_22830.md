Redruth Court, 14 July

Ann Macarthy alias McCaul and Bridget March were charged with using profane, indecent and insulting language on 3 July.

John O’Leary, tanner, said he was passing Macarthy’s house and March was at the door, very drunk.  Macarthy used very insulting words and when he remonstrated she was very abusive.  He informed the police and threatened to inform the Destitute Board from whom she received rations.

Richard Stephens, a butcher, said both defendants came to his shop and made a row.  A black man came for some meat and when he refused to shout Macarthy some she became abusive.  She then also abused another customer named Pounce, eventually attacking him with a meat cleaver and threatening him with a butcher’s knife.  Witness distracted her and Pounce escaped.  Macarthy went away, but later returned and wanted a pluck, [i.e. heart, liver and lungs] becoming abusive when told there was none available.  She then tried to attack him, but he forced her from the shop.  She followed him when he left the premises, later threatening to kill him as well as again being abusive.  Defendant March, who was drunk called the witness some names and wanted to fight him.  For the whole afternoon no one could come to the shop without being insulted and the shop could not be kept open.  Robert Morley, police trooper gave corroborating evidence and further evidence of appalling language in the evening when a crowd gathered around the Macarthy’s house.  He also gave evidence that on at least one occasion the defendants had sold the Destitute Board’s rations and bought drink with the proceeds.  Macarthy was sentenced to one month and March to 14 days in Redruth Gaol.
