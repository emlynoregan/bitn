The Redruth Reformatory.

Agnes Dyke (16) and Maud Daniels (17), who escaped about a fortnight ago, have eluded the police search in a unique manner.  Before leaving they provided themselves with food and clothing and took a shawl of Mrs Holden’s valued at £4-£5.  They made this into two boys’ caps to deceive observers.  They also cut their hair and donned breeches.  The breeches were made from costumes used in concerts and they managed to pass as boys for at least 10 days.  They arrived near Morgan after three days, staying at Mrs Shell’s one night as boys looking for work.  Mistaking the road, they found themselves the next day at Florieton and then went on to Mr Kickebusche’s in the Hd King.  He deduced they were girls and advised them to surrender rather than be taken by the police who were on their track.  M-C Phelan was not far away, but admits he would have passed them as boys.  They travelled at night mostly and if seen in the day pretended to be boys out rabbiting.  They are now again located at Redruth Reformatory.
