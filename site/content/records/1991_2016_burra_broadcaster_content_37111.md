John Ferguson, Assistant Chief Engineer at Southern Cross 10 says they are definitely going to be transmitting SC10 in Burra.  Some of the necessary equipment is already in Pt Pirie, but the problem is a broadcast site in Burra.  The site owner wants about twenty times the floor space rental as for the old Channel 4 transmitter.  If the impasse is not soon resolved SC10 may have to establish its own transmitting site.
