Burra Town Council, 21 December.

Cr Sampson protested that the meeting was illegal, not being held on the proper night.  The Mayor held that the 49th clause of the Act gave adequate justification.

On the application of Mrs Williams of Limestone Hill to have her rates remitted, as she couldn’t pay them the Mayor said remission was not possible, all they could do was allow them to stand over. After some discussion a resolution was passed to call on the landlord (SAMA) to pay the rates.  (Cr West, agent for SAMA protested that the company already provided accommodation without getting rent in such cases.)

Cr Ridgway moved that the solicitors be instructed to bring the Aberdeen Reserve under the Real Property Act.  He cited legal opinion that the origin of the problem lay in 1855 when a plan of old Aberdeen was deposited.  He said there would be no problem in proving public use ever since.

The Council had never asked on what terms the YPMA would hand over the Reserve.  It had just asked for the proper conveyance of what belonged to the Council.  The old town went only to Taylor St and when New Aberdeen was surveyed a new plan including old Aberdeen and showing the Reserve was prepared.  Even if he was wrong no one but the Burra Council had ever questioned the town’s right to the Reserve.  Original purchasers of the town had told him they had bought with the understanding it was a Public Reserve.  It had not been fenced by the Company when they fenced their other property and rates had not been paid on the land.  Cr Tiver 2nd.

Cr West did not want to deprive North Ward of a Reserve, but said as in other plans ‘Reserve’ here, he thought, meant reserved for other purposes.  No rates had been paid, as it was not assessed.  He said the Corporation had no tenure and no reason for claiming the land.  They might become involved in no end of legal expenses.

Cr Sampson said that Cr Ridgway had shed no light on the matter at all.  The plan said ‘Reserve’ and not ‘Public Reserve’.  He didn’t want to go to legal experts, but to leave things as they were at present.  Was North Ward to bear the legal costs - if it were the council as a whole that would do so he would oppose such a move.

Cr Coglin thought the council had moral but not legal right on its side.  The best course was that of Cr Sampson.

Cr Ridgway had no doubt of either the legal or moral right.  The Supreme Court had deemed that ‘Reserve’ meant public use.  He did not propose to enter merely a caveat on the title, but to apply for title under the RPA.  It would be for anyone else to enter a caveat.  It should simply have been gazetted like the other Redruth Reserves, but as the council was not in favour of proceeding he would withdraw the motion.

The Mayor suggested a legal opinion be obtained.  On of the first acts of the district Council when formed was to seek to fence and plant the Reserve, but the ratepayers had not then consented.

Cr Ridgway said that unless the council did something the reported owners would and then Council would have to defend their claim.

Cr Coglin moved that the positions of Inspector and Dayman be merged and the Town clerk and Collector of Rates positions be merged.

The result would be a saving of £100, which would become available for subsidy and so be worth £200.  Cr Sampson said five days notice of such a move had to be given.

Cr Coglin agreed to withdraw his motion till salaries were being discussed.

Council then proceeded with officers and salaries.

Cr Coglin moved Mr Cave be reappointed Town Clerk at the same salary, but including duties related to the Waterworks with a rearrangement of where the payment would come from the different departments to increase the amount able to claim subsidy.

Not 2nd.

Cr West then amended that there be a combined office of Town Clerk, Controller of Waterworks and Inspector of works at £200.  Not 2nd.

Cr Sampson moved a committee report on the matter next meeting. Cr Sampson 2nd.

Cr Tiver amended that the Town Clerk be reappointed at the same salary as at present.  Cr Coglin 2nd.

The amendment was lost on the casting vote of the Mayor.
