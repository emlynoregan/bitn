Burra Hospital

On Wednesday the Committee completed the arrangements for the purchase of the Burra Hotel and the alterations necessary to make it suitable for a hospital will be started as soon as practicable.  We believe this will give general satisfaction, as it has long been felt that the old hospital building [Bleak House] was insufficient for the wants of such a large district.  The hotel contains forty rooms, so there will be ample room for both male and female patients.  It is the intention of the committee to have part of the building available as bedrooms, to be let to persons visiting the town, who do not care to stop at a hotel.  Prior to the purchase of the hotel the additions to the old building had been commenced, but the contractors have agreed to relinquish the work.
