Gordon, Hill, Dollman, G. Tiver (partner of Mr Whittney for 9-10 years, P.L. Rosman, Mr Coverdale, R.C. Lott, R. Jeffery, Tamblyn, L. Quinn, Crang, C. Bruce & H. Armstrong.  Mr Tiver said that while partners they had never had a cross word and he felt it was more like losing a brother than a partner.  They had been through good and bad times together and he hoped Mt Whittney would do well at Gumeracha.
