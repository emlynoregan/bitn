World’s End had a heavy storm and a small tornado struck Mr John Quinn’s homestead tearing the roof off sheds and other outbuildings.  It continued to Sam Finch’s and was followed by a sudden downpour of 1-2 inches, filling all dams and catchments.  It was very confined and neighbours got only a few points.
