Burra Mine

Through the efforts of Mr Ian Auhl, Mr Alister Colebatch, a surveyor for ETSA and Mr Claude Allen MP it has been confirmed that the Burra Town Council owns the mineral rights to the Mine site.  It has been understood for many years that the mineral rights were owned by Mr P.A.M. McBride, even after the purchase of the property by the Corporation in 1960.  Searches through various Departmental records have now satisfied Mr Auhl and Mr Colebatch that the rights lie with the Town Council.  It was arranged through the Mayor Mr E.T. Baulderstone that they attend a meeting of Council to pass on the news of this discovery.  This was done on 27 May last year and it was then resolved that establishment of the ownership of the mineral rights be obtained from the Minister of Mines.  No answer had been obtained when Mr Allen spoke on the possible re-opening of the Burra Mine when he opened the Burra Show.  This prompted a letter to the Record from Mr Ian Auhl in which he asked among other questions whether the MP was aware that the mineral rights belonged to the Town Council and if so what compensation they could expect.  Mr Allen replied in a letter published on 3 December which addressed a number of the questions, but not that related to mineral rights; apparently because there remained some doubt about it.  We now have a letter from Mr Allen with a response from the Minister of Mines.

The area of rights so far as the Corporation is concerned covers the whole of the open cut section and area to the west and south.  Mr Allen has asked what progress has been made on the metallurgical problem.

Hon. R.S. Hall replied that for the period to 31 December 1968 three independent avenues of research are being pursued and the company (Mines Exploration Pty Ltd) said it would probably take six months to finalise these investigations and the Department is confident that the company is doing its best to find a satisfactory solution.
