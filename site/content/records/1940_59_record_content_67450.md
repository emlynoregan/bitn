Burra Town Council

The swing bridge opposite the Town Hall has been closed pending advice on repairs.

A.S. Richards was granted an extension of time to enable him to arrange the disposal of the property at Burra North.

A further letter will be sent to A.S. Tillett re the property on the corner of Kingston St and Bridge Terrace.

Young St Footbridge will be inspected.

The old trough in Market Square is to be removed.

A letter will be written to the Burra North Police re ranking of vehicles in Merthyr St.

[Merthyr St was probably not open at this time, so the reference is most likely to be to Helen Terrace.]
