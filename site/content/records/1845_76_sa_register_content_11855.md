SA Mining

Despite the fall in the copper price from £107 to £95 per ton the returns from the Burra Mine continue as large as before.  The share price is quoted at £135.

The Bon Accord Mine has commenced operations with a good staff and expressions of confidence.  Important new discoveries have been made on the surface of this property.

The Wheal Friendship and the Bremer are beginning to be worked.
