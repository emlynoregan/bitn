Obituary.  Gertrude Blanche Goss was born in Burra on 4 May 1872, the eldest of six children of the late Mr & Mrs Isaac Goss.  Her father was a carpenter and builder, who in the early days of Broken Hill Mines took his family there.  Miss Goss was an organist at one of the Methodist Churches there and it was there she met and married the late Edgar Tiver of Burra in 1895.  After marriage they settled at Oodla Wirra where Mr Tiver was a signaller for the SAR.  Mrs Tiver was organist there at the little wood and iron Methodist Church, with her own little organ, which was carried into the church for the service and is still in her home at Hallett.  Mr Tiver was the Sunday school superintendent and local preacher.  In 1904 Mr & Mrs Tiver and their three eldest children moves to the Hallett District where she lived until last year when in February she moved to Adelaide in the face of advanced age and failing health.  She died there peacefully on 10 June, leaving seven children, twenty-one grandchildren and twenty-five great grandchildren.  Her husband had died 22 years earlier.
