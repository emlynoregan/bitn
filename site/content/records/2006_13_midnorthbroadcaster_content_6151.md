This once proud building is under threat from decay unless financial assistance can be found to save it.  It is currently leased to Burra Regional Art Gallery and it is hoped that with community support it can be restored as a museum and resource centre.

A sub-committee headed by Roger Cross has been formed to help champion the cause.  He said the station would have been restored long ago had it been located in the heart of the town.  The SA Museum is keen to establish a museum for the display of mega fauna and with so much of that being discovered at Redbanks near Burra, the town is a superb location for a museum and working research centre.

Roger suggested the first step is a grant of up to $1,000 to free the building of pigeons and secure it from their entry.  Further grants for a building and costing survey would then be needed.  Volunteers will help, but professional tradespersons will be needed and early estimates put the cost of work at $150,000 to $200,000.  It is estimated that the town gets 120,000 to 150,000 visitors a year and the restoration of the station would help to link the northern and southern parts of the town.  The original Burra Station was a low cost wooden structure erected in 1870.  That was replaced with the existing building in 1883 and this originally included a large arched roof over the tracks, which was removed in 1935.  [Photos.]
