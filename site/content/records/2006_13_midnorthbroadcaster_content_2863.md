Tarcowie Phosphate Co.  There is a page article on this company, which a Bundaleer farmer, Chris Malone started in 2000, after supplies from the Kapunda phosphate mine ceased.  The mine was open for public inspection on 13 March to show off the mine site, its processing plant and its new ‘revive’ rock phosphate product.  The owners are Ian (Canoee), Rosemary and Tom Catford of Tarcowie and Chris & Danielle Malone of Bundaleer.  About 200 tonnes of the product were sold last year.  The current mining lease covers 4.6 km 2 and is expected to last up to 20 years.  [3 photos.]
