Weather.  After a period of oppressive heat, a violent windstorm struck Booborowie on Boxing Day.  Vivid lightning with continuous thunder also brought hail and rain with falls of between 30 and 100 points across the district.  The worst of the wind affected a narrow strip of country, but within that trees were uprooted and haystacks severely damaged.  At R.E. Dewhirstâ€™s a brick chimney was demolished and W. Lomman lost a valuable pig when it was struck by lightning.  The residences of Mrs S.J. Pryde and Mr W. Work were partially unroofed.
