Annika Eder’s address at Burra Community School’s speech night is printed.

The year has taught me a lot about life and people. It has been the greatest experience of my life so far.  I was someone who didn’t want to change schools or move to another place.  I wasn’t really pleased initially at the thought of staying on a farm in the never-never or attending a school with as many students as my senior school at home.  But I quickly changed my mind on arrival.  Everyone was so friendly that I soon forgot initial concerns and set about adjusting to the 40° Australian summer.  First term sporting activities were a great way to meet people.  Team and community spirit seemed much stronger here than at home. For the first time I felt comfortable around people, because they respected me for who I am, I could really be myself without having to fit in with the picture people had of me.  On the down side I soon found that in a small community what you say and do gets around to everyone very soon.  School was different, with the long school bus trip and the lunch breaks three times the length of those in Germany.  It took a while to get to know the people my own age and even harder was to get into conversations where everyone else had watched ‘Neighbours’ and ‘Home and Away’ and laced their conversation with casual references to them.  But everyone made me feel welcome and I got asked to parties from the start.  Agriculture was a great subject to help me get to know the community and the social environment.  We had to work as a team to get our beloved steers to the show.  It was also a new experience to be at a school with students of all ages.  I enjoyed teaching a bit of German to some primary kids.  The opportunity to visit other parts of Australia was also a great experience.  The Burra Squash competition was anew experience in that all age groups played together, while in Germany competition is only between players of the same age group.  Social interaction was also a major difference and I think I am still a bit too German when I feel awkward calling adults I’ve just met by their first name.  I will miss the generally laid back attitude here and the many Australian expressions I have learnt.  I am grateful too for the members of BCS staff and the community of the district who have contributed so much to the great success of the year.  [Photo]
