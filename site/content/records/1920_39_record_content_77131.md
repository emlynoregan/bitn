Obituary.  Mrs Ray L. Jones, nee Dorothy Pederson, died 12 November aged only 39.  She was born in Kooringa and was the only daughter of Martin Pederson Sen. by a second marriage.  She married Mr Ray Jones about 12 years ago and went to Snowtown to live.  Mr Jones had previously worked for Messrs T.W. Wilkinson & Co. chemists.  From Snowtown they moved to the city and later Mr Jones took a position in Sydney.  Mrs Jones has been terminally ill for some time and expressed a desire to return to SA.  This was done, but a fatal termination was not expected so soon.  She died at the home of her sister Olive, Mrs W.H. Spier of Prospect.  There was no family.  She is survived by a husband, two brothers, one step-brother and three step-sisters.  The interment was at Mitcham with Rev. J.P.H. Tilbrook officiating.  [Born Dorothy Pederson 13 March 1900 at Kooringa.  The relationships cited need clarification.  Apart from the two brothers Percival (‘Pompey’) Pederson and John Pederson the others are all half-siblings not step-siblings.  She shared a father with Martin Pederson Jnr, Annie Jeffcott nee Pederson and Elizabeth Willis nee Pederson and she shared a mother with Olive Spier nee Hopgood.]
