Burra Town Council. 26 July

The Kingston St footpath will be attended to, though not before Cr Drew denied that councillors gave preferential consideration to paths and roads leading to their own premises.

Goats trespassing on streets and reserves will be shot after one week’s notice in the Record.

Local Board of Health met and discussed the matters canvassed in the editorial.

Dr Brummitt reported 19 cases of diphtheria in recent weeks, 6 were fatal, of which 5 were in 2-roomed houses, occupied respectively by 8, 3, 5, & 5 persons.  Of other cases 3 were in 3 roomed houses occupied by 10 persons and 2 in a 2 roomed house occupied by 5 or more, with rooms 10’ x 10’ x 7’.  Only 3 of 19 cases were in houses with over 3 rooms and most were in houses not remarkable for their cleanliness.

John R. Gray, inspector, presented a statistical report listing cases, number of rooms, deaths, and number of inhabitants.  The worst cases seem to have been in the brick rows of Thames and Bridge Streets in which the floors are of wet brick and the ceilings of calico.  The houses should be declared unfit until they have new dry floors and new ceilings.

Cases	Deaths	Rooms	No. of Inhabitants
