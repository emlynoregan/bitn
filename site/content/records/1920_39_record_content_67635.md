Mongolata Goldfield

Bylesâ€™ Mongolata GM Co.  Mr I.J. Warnes has shown us some extraordinary formations of ore from the 267ft level of the shaft.

All the new machinery is now in place and fixed.  Half the cost will be borne by the Government.  This has held up new work for some time, but it can now proceed.
