The State Election.  On Friday evening 20-30 people attended an election meeting at the Institute which was addressed by Messrs Jenkins, Dickson & T. Hawke (Of the Farmers & Settlersâ€™ Association).

Mr T. Hawke said their movement wanted to secure direct representation for primary industries.  Its members were liberal in thought and policy and anti-socialistic and had the same ticket as the Liberal Union.  Of particular interest to the FSA were water conservation and freight charges.
