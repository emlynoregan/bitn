Obituary.  J.P. [Joseph Patrick] Murphy died at Kooringa on 11 May.  He was a native of Victoria, the youngest son of the late Mr & Mrs N.H. Murphy of Moonie Ponds and was born at Hamilton in 1874 and educated at Bordertown and a college at Ararat.  He was then employed by the National Bank at Nhill and in 1910 was manager at Quambatook and then at Bright in Victoria.  His first appointment in SA was to Pt Adelaide and then Kooringa.  Here he was for two or three years a member of the Institute Committee.  In January this year he was elected President, but never took his chair as illness intervened.  He was a keen member of the Bowling and Golf Clubs.  He is survived by a wife and three daughters.
