Swimming.  The Advertiser learn to swim campaign has sparked a meeting at the Institute on Wednesday and it was decided to form a Burra Swimming Club.  Mr Milton Teddy and Rev. H.S. Jarvis contacted the Mayor to get things going. Rev. Jarvis said it was rather late to be starting this year, but a move could be made that would make it better next year.  The Mine Pool was clean and there was no refuse in it and no danger with ordinary care.  Some improvements were necessary: there was no place for young children to learn.  There were contributions from Mr Tiddy, J. Burt and L. Winkley who have all visited the pool regularly.  The pool is fed by a strong underground stream and is not standing water.

The Burra Amateur Swimming Club was formed.  J.F. Fletcher was appointed Hon. Secretary with D.T. McBain as his assistant.  Mr Woollacott was elected Chairman.  The owners A.J. & P.A. McBride are to be approached for a pepper-corn rent for two years.  A Committee was appointed and a working bee has already started improvements.  A learn to swim campaign will begin shortly.
