Biographical Sketch of John Sampson.

John Sampson was born in Cornwall in 1831 and is now 62.  He took passage to Australia on 2 July 1847 and after the then fast passage of 84 days reached Port Adelaide and he became under waiter at the Club House Hotel in Hindley St Adelaide.  When only 17 he took the first load of copper from Burra to Port Arthur, 10 miles west of Pt Wakefield.  In 1857 he took a position with SAMA to look after all the open lands outside the mine property stretching to Mt Bryan.  After about 8-9 years he went into business as a butcher for c. 2 years.  Since then he has been a commission agent.  About 15 years ago he was elected Councillor for South Ward, beating W. Geake by 1 vote.  Next term he was unopposed and the one after that he defeated A. Harris. The fourth and fifth terms were unopposed and then he fought off a challenge from A. Harris, J. Pearce and W.H. Hardy for his sixth term.  In 1891 Hardy defeated him by 12 votes and in 1893 he beat Hardy by double that.  He has been a Councillor for 13 years altogether.  When he arrived in 1847 he lived in a tent, there being then no houses except the big cottages fronting the Primitive Methodist Church.  Redruth was a patch of grass, but many dugouts were in the creek.  In 1857 there were 12,000 inhabitants in the town.  He carried the first load of stone for the Bible Christian Schoolroom and the Kooringa Bible Christian church.  He was on the committee that arranged with SAMA for the purchase of the Burra Oval.  He is of a generous nature and gives freely to those not as fortunate as himself.  During the Broken Hill strike he was a friend of the workers, collecting and subscribing large sums to relieve the strikers.
