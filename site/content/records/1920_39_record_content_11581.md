Burra Town Council

Council agrees to lop five trees at the oval for the Cricket Club and to allow a practice area behind the Bowling Club.

Boz Pearce and Guy Tiddy from the Aberdeen Tennis Club ask for a block near Mr Tiddy’s house for 2 or three tennis courts on a lease with right of renewal.  A lease was granted for 99 years at £1 p.a.
