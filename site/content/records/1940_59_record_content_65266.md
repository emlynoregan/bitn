The Burra Show on Saturday drew a record crowd.  The weather was perfect.  Gate takings were £206 and would have been more had passengers on the special railcar not escaped paying entrance fees.  The points at the siding could not be moved and the passengers alighted some distance from the entrance gate and entered through the fence.  Judges said the poultry and bird display was the finest outside the Royal Show.  Sideshows were numerous, although young children missed the merry-go-round.  Machinery, electrical goods and car exhibits were numerous and created much interest.  Local displays of this nature were outstanding, by H.J.B. Jennison, Davies Motor Co., Burra Motor Co., Fiebig’s Service Station, E.A. Stacey Ltd and Oates Ltd.

Entries overall were about the same as for 1953.

President Mr Warnes was disappointed with the sheep entries.

Flowers were outstanding and the display much improved.  ‘This reflects much credit on Mr R. Fuss who has put a lot of thought and work into this pavilion.’

The aggregate prize in that section went to Mrs H. Jennison.

The wool exhibit was much praised by the judge.  Reed Bros exhibited the best fleeces in the show.

Competition in sheep was not up to the average, but the quality had been maintained.

Needlework was of a high standard.
