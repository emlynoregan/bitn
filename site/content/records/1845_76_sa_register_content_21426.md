Bushfires have swept through many runs in the past week.

Severe damage is reported for Hummocks, Booyoolie, Anama, Bungaree, Bundaleer, Mannanarie, Tongula, Canowie and Booborowie Runs.

Duffield & Porter’s Springbank Run is destroyed.  All the paddocks on the Sod Hut side of the range are burnt.

Part of Gottlieb’s Wells and Munjibbie Runs were burnt on Wednesday and the Mannanarie fire spread through Tarcowie and part of Pekina.  Further north a fire broke out at Horrock’s Pass and a large part of Mr Angas’s station was burnt.  The only sheep losses mentioned so far are about 200 on Bundaleer.

Farmers have been spared except for six or seven near Sevenhills.
