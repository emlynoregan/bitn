The weather was vile with a strong hot northerly, but by noon fully 200 had turned up at the school.  W.A. Pitt MA Inspector came on the midday train.  Some came in costumes of the past.  Headmaster A.A. Nelson and C.P. Turner Chairman of the School Committee with present scholars greeted the arrivals.  A.D. McDonald MP opened the day.  the mayor of Burra and A.B. Riggs Chairman of the Burra School Committee also attended.  Mr McDonald declared the event open, commenting on the presence of former head teacher Tom Nevin.  The Mayor T.H. Woollacott was an old scholar.

Luncheon was served in the schoolroom on four long tables.  The room was nice and cool and beautifully decorated and there was a sumptuous knife and fork spread.  The speeches are reported at length.

Mr Brassey Woodgate proposed ‘Old Teachers’ as he represented one of the oldest Copperhouse families: the Dunnemans.  His mother was a Miss Dunneman and spent her early life there.  She is now almost 90 and living in Adelaide.  Mr Woodgate recalled his old master Mr Nevin and was pleased to see Mrs R. Fuss nee Ellen Saunders [sic: for Sanders] another old teacher.  He commented on the meagre salaries of past years.

Mr Nevin responded.  He had taken charge in 1887 at a time when he had lung trouble and the school was about the size of a 400 gallon tank with no decent light, no ventilation and the worst of sanitary arrangements.  He recalled Miss E. Saunders’ birth [1889] and never thought that before he left she would be assisting him as monitor.  He had married Miss Agnes Rabbich of Aberdeen while teaching in Copperhouse.  (She was also present.)

Mr Fuss [presumably Mr L.R. Fuss] gave the toast ‘Old Scholars’ and though not an old scholar himself Mr Nevin had been his first teacher at Burra Model School.  He said he knew many Aberdeen lads who went to Copperhouse School, taking the short cut across ‘Dicky’ Austin’s paddock and sometimes riding his calves and chasing emus – after some such escapades having to go the long way round.

T.H. Woollacott responded for the scholars.

He had first gone to school at one kept by Miss Nevin and Miss Rabbich in the old German Church, since demolished.  Later Mr Nevin was his schoolmaster.  In fact his own mother went to the school 70 years ago when there were 75-80 girls on the roll.  Other old scholars to speak were Cr Charlie Bevan and J.D. (Dunc.) Kelly.

Glen Finch then toasted ‘The School’ and Allan Lomman responded.

Luncheon took about three hours.

Mr Nevin was presented with a turned mulga tobacco bowl.  In the afternoon a program of sports was gone through and the results are printed.  There was also a pet show and in the evening a dance.  F. Spencer took group photos of all old scholars.  On Sunday Mr Nevin preached at the Copperhouse Service at 7 p.m. (shifted from 10 a.m. to enable more friends to be present).
