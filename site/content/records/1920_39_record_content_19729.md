Burra Coursing Club held a meet on 9, 10 & 11 June which was the most successful ever.  There were a large number of entries from around the state.  Much is due to the energy of the secretary and his assistant, Mr J. Carpenter & ‘Twist’ Ockenden and also to the President, George Clarke of the Kooringa Hotel.  The meeting was on the Gum Creek Estate of the Hon. W.G. Duncan and on Mr T. H. Bailey’s run.  Mr Tilbrook of Balaklava took the prize and Messrs Symonds & Lynch were runners-up.
