[Mr Warnes then goes on to defend his position on the Mt Bryan District Council and he also itemises how he has helped young men returning from the war to get established by selling them land at low cost.]

As for the Burra including the district in acknowledgements, he mentions the Ambulances, which, when handed over, were given the appearance of having all come from Burra, when the people of Burra gave one and two gentlemen gave one and the money was collected from the district.

He reads out a report of Peace Day at Leighton, from when the decision was made to have a separate Peace Day was made.  He still believes what he said then.

Mr Rigby then spoke in support of Mr Warnes.

He considered Mr Pearse had taken the opportunity to settle old scores.

He said, ‘long before I came here I had heard of Mr Warnes, and his character, and it is useless for me to try to extol him in your minds.  I appreciate much a liberal-minded man who tries to live up to the reputation of manhood and makes his word his bond, but I do not wish to enlarge upon that.’

He was opposed to giving any help to Burra until the Mt Bryan project was completed.

He agreed that centralisation was the curse of the times.

Mr Warnes ended by saying: ‘The first thing is that the Burra Record should give us a big donation, because the people will want hundreds of papers.’
