Noel G. Tiver will retire from Hallett DC on 30 June after 26 years on Council.  He began in 1927 as one of the three members for Anne Ward of the Booborowie DC.  After eight years this Council was disbanded and Ayers Ward went to the Burra Burra DC and Anne Ward to the Hallett DC.  Mr Tiver was initially defeated at the first election for Willalo Ward of the enlarged Council, but was elected in 1937 and has represented the Willalo Ward ever since.  He has also been Chairman of the Council and has missed only one meeting.  As a farewell he was presented with a travelling rug.  Mr Eric Ashby has been elected unopposed for Willalo Ward.
