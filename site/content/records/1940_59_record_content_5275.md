A.J. Franklin of ‘Flagstaff’ Burra North also writes in support of Rev. Gray and to attack Olive Bence’s letter, which ‘was a disgraceful attack on this gentleman; who is probably voicing the opinion of the other churches in the district with the exception perhaps of the Catholics.’

‘Why wasn’t this cricket match played on a Saturday afternoon? … No, these chaps would rather stick around the betting shops, hotels and billiard saloons, wasting time and money in foolish living; perhaps a few may have been working, what of it; others could have taken their places.’

Olive Bence ‘was noticeable by her absence from the Gas and Bomb lecture on March 5th, which should be attended by all right thinking citizens of this town;  but this should have been held on a Sunday and then Olive Bence would have been there.’

[The attack then becomes even more personal.  The writer goes on to recommend sections of the Bible for study and ends by commending Mr Gray for the God-fearing manner in which he attacked these people.]

‘And I hope he continues with his work and rid[s] the town for good of this evil.’
