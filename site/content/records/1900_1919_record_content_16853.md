Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co.  The best we can learn is that there is no fixed policy decision about the action when the water is pumped from the pool.  The pump is still idle.  Mr Pryor says shafts will be put down near the waterâ€™s edge and if ore is struck it will assist the directors in making a decision.  There is not enough cash to go on much longer.  The pumping house has been closed for three weeks.  Pumping, it was said, would begin last December, but only a little has been done.  We do not condemn the mine which we believe is one of the best, but the method in which it is being worked.
