Burra Football Club AGM

President G.M .Kellock reported on the year.  Junior Colts won the premiership without losing a game for the year.  Though less successful, the Senior Colts provided their supporters with good football.  ‘B’ Grade ended up with the wooden spoon.  The ‘A’ Grade team did better, winning through to the Preliminary Final and losing that by just a few points.  Kevin Lane is congratulated on his five years as senior coach, in which time the club has taken out two premierships and was twice runner-up.  He has asked to be relieved of this task for 1973 and as a consequence D. Kellock has been appointed.  Gate takings in 1972 were double those of 1971 and the increased admission from 40 to 50 cents only accounts for a small part of this.  Elected for 1973:

President	J. Secomb

Vice-Presidents	T. Lehmann & R. Nicholls

Secretary	A. Day

Treasurer	H. Heitbrink
