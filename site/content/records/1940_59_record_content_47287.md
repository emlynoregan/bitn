Burra Water Supply

Mr G.S. Hawker MP advises that as far as he can discover no effort was made to get River Murray water for Burra when a pipe was laid to get it to the Railway Station.  This pipe is too small to supply the town.  Analysis of the town water showed it to be nearly as bad as Peterborough’s and worse than Bordertown’s.   The Town Council is desirous of every effort being made to obtain River Murray water.
