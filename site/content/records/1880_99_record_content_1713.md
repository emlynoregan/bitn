Editorial on the Railway Tariff

A call is made for the rate for grain to be reduced by 1d per ton per mile.  This is essential if farmers are to move into areas further from ports.  Roads and railways are not constructed to make a profit, but to open up the land and to develop the country.  In SA the following lines make a profit. (% nett revenue to capital)

Adelaide-Semaphore	47.59%

Adelaide-Hallett & Morgan	4.13%

Hamley Bridge-Pt Wakefield

Wallaroo & Snowtown	0.40%

Pt Pirie-Jamestown	11.4%

All others make a loss (i.e. Kingston-Naracoorte, Mt Gambier-Rivoli Bay, Strathalbyn-Middleton, Goolwa & Victor Harbor, Pt Broughton-Barunga)
