Tennis Clubs

Separate meetings of the Aberdeen and Kooringa Tennis Clubs to discuss amalgamation have resulted in a recommendation to go ahead and a meeting is consequently scheduled for the Aberdeen Football Club Rooms at 8 p.m. tomorrow.  Last season Aberdeen had six teams: Two ‘A’, 3 ‘B’ and a Junior.  Kooringa had four teams: 1 ‘A’, 2 ‘B’ and a Junior.  Aberdeen has its own five courts, while Kooringa has been renting courts from the school.

It is thought the amalgamated club would be likely to ask Council permission for three more courts adjacent to their present courts at Burra North.
