Burra Corp. W. Woollacott waited on the Council to complain that his nomination to stand for Mayor had been returned to him opened. The mayor denied that it had ever been received.

W. Woollacott asked for a cheque for £50 in payment for the White Hart Ford footbridge. He was given £40 with the rest to follow when Cr. Sara returned.

Cr. Roberts said the springs in The Paddock were nearly choked and the dayman should attend to them considering the current water shortages.
