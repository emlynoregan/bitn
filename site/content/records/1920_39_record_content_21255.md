Burra Shell Depot

Year by year Burra is growing and so it is good to see the British Imperial Oil Co. acknowledge this by placing a depot in the town.  They purchased Butterwoth’s Mill as the site.  The mill was gutted and the two top floors removed and it was turned into a garage.  Tanks were installed and connected to the railway station by pipe.  There are two 8,000 gallon tanks.  There is a 600 gallon road tanker to distribute petrol to the district.  The depot was opened with a luncheon in the garage on 4 November.  The Mayor presided and welcomed the SA Manager, Mr Day.  Mr Tom Fuller was placed as manager.  Mr Crewes also spoke in welcoming the company.  Mr Day said something of the company’s history.
