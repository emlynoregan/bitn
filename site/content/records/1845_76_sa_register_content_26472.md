Local Government Meeting

A meeting of ratepayers was held at Orchard’s Hotel [Aberdeen Hotel] on the 26 July to consider the desirability of Aberdeen, Redruth and the suburban townships into a Municipal Corporation.  Captain Killicoat, Chairman of the Burra DC, presided.  He said that many thought the move highly desirable and saw a great need for a Town Council.  W.R. Ridgway spoke in support of the move; he considered the District Council affairs had been much muddled.  He thought the town badly under-represented in the DC.  Aberdeen-Redruth had grown of late and this was a trend likely to continue.  He moved that a Corporation should be made comprising Redruth, Aberdeen, New Aberdeen, Graham, Roachtown, Nelson, Hampton & Millerton.  Seconded by A. Bartholomæus.

O. Harvey moved that the time for a Corporation had not arrived.  Mr Ridgway had not done his calculations well.  There were too few houses to support a Council.  Harvey asserted that a 1/- rate would bring in only £150 and a 2/- one £300 and they could hardly manage with less than that.  He then went on to calculate that after necessary expenses they would only have £75 p.a. for roadwork.

W.R. Ridgway disputed both Harvey’s valuation and his list of necessary expenditures.

The chairman declared Harvey’s amendment carried by a majority of six.

Captain Killicoat defended the DC against Mr Ridgway’s remarks.  The latter had contended that the DC spent very little in Redruth Ward, but a large sum had been spent.  Roads had been made.  He would like to see Mr Ridgway do half as much for the same amount.  He had come to fill the chair, but had he known the sort of remarks Mr Ridgway had made were to be presented, he would not have attended.
