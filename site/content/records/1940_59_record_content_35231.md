Burra Town Council has some good grants for both town and district roads, but is having trouble finding the labour to spend the grants.  Recently a call for tenders to supply metal for local roads did not receive any response.  The Council eventually got 80 tons of metal from Adelaide.  The cost to raise the metal is about the same, but freight and shunting costs must be added, making it rather dear.
