SES volunteers played a major role in apprehending the escaped detainees last week and on Saturday rescued a dog that had fallen down a mine shaft at Mongolata.  [A comment by Helen Stockman in the ‘In Town & Out’ section of Issue 597, 16 April 2003, page 2 reveals that this was Graham Kellock’s sheep-dog ‘Nell’.]
