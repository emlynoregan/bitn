Burra Burra DC has received a small grant for preliminary work on realigning the Burra-Morgan Road near Diprose Creek.  The new section will begin just past the bridge near ‘Fords’, will delete the bridge over Diprose and re-enter the existing road halfway up ‘Breakneck’.  A further grant next year is expected to allow the work to be completed.
