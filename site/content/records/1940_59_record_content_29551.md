Adelaide Fire Station

Botanic Gardens

Art Gallery

Museum

Parliament House

Technical night classes in Woodwork and night and day classes in Dressmaking were instituted.

Intermediate Drawing was introduced and in 1947 Bookkeeping will be re-introduced, possibly as an alternative to Latin in First year.

Money is being spent improving Physical Education and Sports equipment and on the Library.

Regular inter-school sports matches have been played and the Annual Sports Day was held in August, in which the Senior Cups went to Mary Pearce and Rex Haese and the Junior Cups to Dawn Bernhardt and Francis Ford [Frances in the paper.]

BHS competed in the Mid North High schools Sports Meeting at Kapunda and although it was the smallest school in the competition it came second to Clare.

In 1947 this event will be hosted by Burra.

[The headmaster then went on to thank the School Council and the Parents & Friends’ Association.]

The loss by departure from the town of Dr Steele is greatly regretted.  He had been President of the High School Council for about 26 years.  It had been decided to name one of the two Houses at the School Steele House and the other Draysey House in honour of a previous Acting Headmaster who gave his life in WWII.

Also lost to the school community this year with regret were Mrs C. Pearce, for many years Treasurer of the Parents & Friends’ Association and Mr G.P. S. Harvey, who had been an active Council Member.

[A list of others who were thanked then followed.]

The Girls’ Choir then sang The Fleet’s in Port

The Acting Chairman of the School Council, Mr A.B. Riggs, then spoke – the first time Dr Steele had not performed that duty since the Council was formed.

[Mr Riggs speech is printed.  In his speech he said the Department had a block of land on which it had for many year intended to build a residence for the Headmaster and now after much lobbying by the Council the Department now said the house would be built within six months.  He indicated that the school bus service had increased the enrolment by about 20.

Intermediate Certificates gained at the 1945 exams were distributed:
