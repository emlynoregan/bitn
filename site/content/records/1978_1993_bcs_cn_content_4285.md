Burra & District Hospital Auxiliary had a busy year with a membership of 80.

Thanks to Mrs Scroop and her sewing committee and to Mrs Pearse and her jam-making ladies.  We now have a number of activities for our patients, including bingo, games and handicrafts.  The Apex Club planted trees for the group and the Lions Club erected a fence for a vegetable garden.
