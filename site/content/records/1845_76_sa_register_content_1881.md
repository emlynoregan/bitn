Court Case

Richard Harris Eade, alias Richard Eade was charged with fraudulently forging and altering money orders drawn by Tristram Bath on the Directors of the Princess Royal Mining Co. on 25 September.

There were four counts:

Forging an order on Mr Thomas Coombes for £6-11-8, with intend to defraud the Directors of the PRMC; the original order being for £0-11-8.

Uttering the said forged order.

Forging the said order with intent to defraud George Morphett, a Director of the PRMC.

Uttering the order with this intent.

Tristram Bath, Superintendent of the Princess Royal Mine, gave evidence of settling with Eade for 11/8 for sharpening tools and the order now read £6-11-8.  Eade was working at tut-work and was to have 1/8 per day in overtime for sharpening tools in the absence of the blacksmith.  On the same morning he had given him an order of £7-12-6 for the tut-work.

Thomas Coombes, a miner, who could neither read nor write, asked the prisoner to lend him some money to buy a horse and he gave him an order for £6-11-8.  Coombes gave the order to Mr Cousins in part payment for a horse costing £17.  Gave the prisoner an order for £6-17-2 and the prisoner paid the difference back.

John Cousins confirmed this.

Edward Wright, Secretary of the PRMC said he did not pay the order when it was presented on 1 October because it had been altered.  Mr Morphett was one of the directors at the time.

The jury found the accused guilty of forgery and of uttering.

The prisoner was then charged with forging and uttering another order on the same day, 16 September.  Originally issued for £5-4-4 to Zacharia Grey, it had been passed for £12-4-4.

The accused was again found guilty.

Two character witnesses were called: Thomas Coombes and John Cousins.

The prisoner had a wife and three children.

Sentencing was deferred.
