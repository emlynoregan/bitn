Burra Hospital Board.  The meeting on Thursday was principally concerned with the cost over-runs due to high commodity prices.  The Chief Secretary had advised that the hospital will have to become either a fully-funded Government Hospital, serving only those who could not pay or a subsidised hospital where it would be supported by a rate and subsidised 30/- for each Â£1 raised.  Mr Bice urged the latter.  Mr Winnall so moved and it was carried.  He also moved the Inspector General be asked to bring the district under the Rating Act.  Carried.  Honorary surgeons would be sought with the right of private practice in the hospital.  Matron (Sister Carter) tendered her resignation.
