BCS Principal’s Report 1998

The delay in the Telstra Tower has been frustrating.

It was unfortunate that BCS goats got into the neighbour’s property.

We have been forced to rationalise staff for 1999 by reducing the number of teachers by two.

We will be able to form only six classes at R-7 instead of seven – meaning larger class sizes.

We will also lose a secondary teacher, although no curriculum program will be lost.

External repainting has begun, which will see the dated ‘mission brown’ replaced by ‘Brunswick Green’.

The irrigation system is now working well.

Agricultural block has been set up for irrigation of the lucerne paddocks.

The cost of keeping up with new technology is a challenge for the budget.

A new computer network has been installed.

The trial of Mind Matters – aimed at reducing Australia’s unacceptable levels of youth suicide will continue in 1999.
