Christmas Eve in Burra was very busy, especially when shops reopened from 7-9 p.m.  Streets were gaily decorated with coloured lights and were crowded with cars.  Pavements and shops were thronged with people.  A large silver tree occupied the lawn in Market Square.  After the shops closed the combined Anglican and Methodist Choirs sang carols in Market Square.  Mayor E.T. Baulderstone and Cr E. Finch of the District Council and Rev. Lenthall for the Ministers’ Fraternal, delivered Christmas and New Year addresses.  The Rural Youth organised a dance afterwards in the Show Hall that netted £16-15-0.
