Burra Hospital

The group of concerned citizens who met with the Health Minister last week say they are dissatisfied with the response and are calling for a Parliamentary Enquiry.  The original decision to remove the approval for Dr Dharma Dissanayake to provide accident and emergency care services at Burra Hospital has been reviewed by the same members of the committee who made the decision, but it has been confirmed that the appeal has still not been heard, months after it was made.
