Georgia Hyde Secretary of the Burra Arts Council writes:

The old Post & Telegraph Office presently being used as the postmaster’s residence is soon to be sold by Australia Post.  At first glance this building may seem to be an ugly collection of additions and unsympathetic paintwork.  Beneath that there lies evidence of a once grand building with many a story to tell of the bustling days of Burra.  Although it is a heritage listed building the current and future owners have no obligation to restore it to its former glory.  We of the Burra Arts Council feel the building should be donated to the town for use as an Art Gallery and/or a Post & Telegraph Museum.  Restored, it would be a great asset to the town.  We have written to many organisations including J150, Heritage, National Trust and the SA Art Gallery, hoping to enlist support for getting Australia Post to donate the building in time for Burra’s 150th anniversary in 1995.  We hope the people and Council of Burra will support us too by writing letters to Australia Post and the above organisations to save the building for public use.

Helen Stockman, past Chairman of the 1st Parent Scout Group writes to say that the other night the 1st Burra Scout Group and its Parent Group were disbanded after a long period of activity in the town.  Although it is sad to see this, we can look back over the history of the group with pride.  Not many other towns in the Mid North can boast such a line-up of Queen’s Scouts and such fine people.  Many thanks to all who served the Scout Group over the years.

Notice.  A Public Meeting is called at 10 Morehead Street on Wednesday 9 June at 7.30 p.m. to discuss the future directions of the Burra District.
