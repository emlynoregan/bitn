‘We wish the Directors of the Burra Burra could see it right to offer such terms to persons settling on their property at Kooringa as might induce them to improve the appearance and condition of the township, as it presents a most abject and forbidding aspect to a stranger visiting it.  The town ought to be under municipal regulations, that the accumulation of rubbish in the various thoroughfares might be cleared away.  It is also desirable that the dilapidated buildings should be removed or renovated.’

23 April 1858, page 3

Henry Ayers Secretary of the SA Mining Association writes to the Editor in response to the suggestion that the Directors should induce residents to improve the appearance of Kooringa:

The leases are granted on generous terms for 21 years at the nominal rent of from £1 to £5 per half acre for town lands.  Persons applying for extensions to leases have always been liberally treated.  From time to time the Company has spent large sums of money on improving Kooringa, including cleaning the streets, but it can scarcely be expected that a company that laid out the township some 12 or 13 years ago, should be expected to continue to make bridges, repair streets, and act as scavenger.

‘It is time that the inhabitants made some effort to remedy what I most willingly admit to be a very serious evil.’

[The editor urges the residents to at once petition the Government for the extension of the Corporation Act to the town.]

Royal Mining Co. shareholders, living in Kooringa, went down to see the mine today and to look at the property they personally bought, adjacent to it.  They report great alterations at the Royal following the employment of a number of men by Mr Hare.  The lode has been exposed.  They have decided to ‘set’ their property.  They have consequently set men to work to costeen over their property, which they call by the native name of Pinyonga.  It is believed there are many offering to work at either property.
