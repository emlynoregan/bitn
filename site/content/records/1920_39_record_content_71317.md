Salvation Army.  Last Sunday Adj. Vonthetoff was farewelled and a social was given her on Monday.  She has resigned on her approaching marriage.  She will be succeeded by Captain Rust and Lieut. Carver.  Envoy Aberg and officers of the local corps have a scheme on hand to raise £100 to complete quarters for officers at the rear of the Barracks.  Headquarters would advance a further £100.  Throughout their existence in Burra the Army here has never owned a home and payment of rent has been a constant drain on resources.
