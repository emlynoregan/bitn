Characteristics of the paper in 1918.

Page 1

Large advertisements in the main and mostly of local origin.

Page 2

A mixture of different sized advertisements, but nearly all are local and particularly concerned with sales, local government and public announcements.  The amount of news fluctuates from none to almost half the page.

Page 3

News and a couple of larger advertisements.

Page 4

Some news in fluctuating amounts, but advertisements generally dominate, though some of them look very much like news items at first glance.

The paper in general gives a very good cover of district events throughout the year and in particular traces the lives and deaths of district servicemen and women.  Local patriotic efforts are covered in considerable detail.
