Redruth Court, Wednesday 29 March.  ‘A Very Amusing Case.’

W.H. Hardy charged W.J. Davey, proprietor of the Burra Record, with libel, damages being assessed at £19-19-0.  The case took 7½ hours and the plaintiff was severely cross examined for 4½ hours by Mr J.H. Symon QC whose summing up took 2 hours 10 minutes.  The rest of the time was taken by the evidence of W.T. Rabbich for the plaintiff and the summing up of Mr H.R. Hill.  In the end the case was declared a non suit without costs.

Business in the town was practically suspended and visitors came from far and near.

[The report runs for 6½ columns in this issue and at similar length in the next two.]

H.R. Hill appeared for the plaintiff and J.H. Symon QC for the defendant.

Mr Hill said his client had originally intended to sue on eight counts, but would now abandon Section F as it was really a private matter and he doubted if the words applied to him.

The charges related to material printed in the Burra Record and alleged that Davey published statements that:

Implied misconduct by Hardy as a Councillor.

Suggested Hardy had a want of qualifications and skill as a newspaper correspondent.

Suggested Hardy had qualities and conduct disparaging to him resulting in public hatred, ridicule and contempt.

The specific material was:

A)	Feb. 3 1892.  When reporting a vote of censure on Cr Hardy in the Council the writer suggests Hardy had tried to obstruct the business of the town and to annoy members of Council and implies Hardy was to blame for ‘things [that] have been so disgraceful of late’. 

B) July 13 1892.  [Hardy had suggested in writing for the Catholic paper that Mr Holder was writing the leading articles for the Record.]  Davey had written that Hardy had offered to do the job for 10/- per week, but ‘we had such contempt for him and all his effusions that we did not entertain his offer in any shape or form . . . Even at this absurd price we considered his service not worth the amount.’
