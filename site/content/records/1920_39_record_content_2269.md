Burra Show Society Meeting, Friday 15 October.

I.J. Warnes chaired a meeting to consider getting a showground of its own for the Society.

W.H. McWaters said he thought it was time the Society had a ground of its own.  At present they used the Sports Syndicate’s property.  He had no problem with the Syndicate, but asked where the Society would be in 20 years time.  It was like building a house on someone else’s property.  He moved that the Society procure a Showground of its own.

C. Fuss thought they had a fine ground owned by gentlemen who would safeguard the Society’s interests and give it every consideration.  They had made extensive improvements of no personal benefit and he felt it would be silly to throw their handsome generosity back in their teeth.  As it was incorporated there was no fear of them treating the Society badly and they could be relied upon for fair play.  (Applause and cries of hear, hear.)

M.A. Radford said the Syndicate had bought the ground for the betterment of society and for use as a sports ground and the public was indebted to them, but at present they [the Show Society] could be ordered off at five minute’s notice.  (Cries of No!) And could be told to shift as they had been this year.  They wanted a new ring and seating and a grandstand and a site nearer the town.  The present ring was not right and the grandstand too far off.

Mr Hawkes asked if the Syndicate had ever asked the Society to shift – Mr Warnes said – yes – the second ring had to be moved.
