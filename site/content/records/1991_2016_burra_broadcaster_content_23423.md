Burra Leisure Activity Group held a luncheon on 18 October.  Fifty-six people attended from Burra, Booborowie, Mt Bryan and Hallett.  The lunch was a ‘Celebrate Seniors’ event and began with a pet show followed by a display of 460 show entries including crafts, cooking, cut flowers, plants, jams, pickles and chutney.  There was also a wonderful display of teddy bears and dolls.  Diane Waters convened the three course meal and the day ended with a Devonshire afternoon tea.

Rachel Fry a student at Burra Community School has won a regional prize in the ABC Heywire Competition.  The competition required young people 16-22 to make a three-minute non-fiction radio story.  Rachel will now go to Canberra with 38 other regional winners to the Heywire Youth Issues Forum in February 2001.  [Photo]
