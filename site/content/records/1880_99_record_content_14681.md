Burra Waterworks.  The mains originally included in the plans have now been laid.  A temporary engine has been provided and the reservoir on the hill to hold 31,000 gallons has been excavated and is being walled in with concrete and as soon as it is ready the house services will be fixed and water is expected to be available in about one month.  It is hoped the issue of the meter rental will be resolved by then.
