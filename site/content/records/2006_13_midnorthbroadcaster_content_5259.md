Barry Eberhard’s clearing sale recently marked the end of an era as he sold his last property within the Burra area.  The family has owned property in the Burra area since Murray Eberhard (Barry’s father) bought over 4,000 acres of Mullaby in 1954.  Over the years Barry and his brother also acquired properties at World’s End – ‘Baldina Downs’.  Most of Mullaby was sold a couple of years ago to T. & R. Pastoral Co., leaving just 166 acres on Wandillah Road, which was home to Barry’s mother for many years.  Barry & Judy have retired to Burra, but their son Simon has a sheep and cattle property near Angaston.
