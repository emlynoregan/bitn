Burra Railway.

A Government party inspected the line on Thursday 23 June as far as it has been completed.  They travelled in one of the new bogie carriages hauled by one of the new small engines designed for the line.  [The official party is listed and included G.S. Kingston & Henry Ayers.]

The weather was very bad, especially for a party which had at regular intervals to get out and make inspections of the line.  It rained heavily all the way.  Inspections were made at all the stations along the route.  The train departed Adelaide at 9.30 a.m. and reached Smithfield at 10.10 a.m.

[The American bogie principle, seen on the new carriage, is then described; it being the newest such design seen in SA.  The bogie is well adapted to sharp curves, but this line did not test it out as the sharpest curve is 30 chains and most are between 40 and 60 chains.  Tarlee was reached at 12.30 p.m. and Riverton at 1.15 p.m.

The extension of the line begins at Forresters [Tarlee] and runs 46½ miles up the valley of the Gilbert to Burra.  It has been contracted to be built for £5,000 per mile.  The line runs about 70 miles from the Roseworthy Junction.  The first contract was let just over two years ago to Mr Haynes and ran almost seven miles or nearly to the Riverton Station.  The rest of the line has progressed so rapidly that three contracts have been in operation at the same time.  Some of the contracts have employed up to 250 men.  Mr Bloomfield gained the second contract for 14 miles.  He had previous experience on the Port Wakefield line.  This carried the line to Manoora.  Mr Walker carried on a further 14 miles to a point about a mile and a half beyond Farrell Flat.  Messrs Fry’s contract for 11 miles then almost reached to the Burra terminus.  The last half mile was let to Mr James Tiver, a local contractor when the final location for the Aberdeen Station had been decided.  There have been five contracts for the earthworks and as many for the station buildings.  The laying of the permanent way has been undertaken by Messrs  Bond & Morris.  Most of the building contracts have gone to Messrs Schroeder & Wishart, Sara & Sons and James Tiver.  The construction has been closely supervised and the relationships between contractors and engineers have been good.  The result has been some of the best work done in the colony and for costs as low as the execution has been creditable.  The gradients on the line are easy with the steepest 1 in 91.  Although the terrain is largely flat considerable expenditure has been needed on culverts and bridges.  The stations will be better than originally planned, but the improvements are in accommodation rather than external ornament.

From Tarlee to Riverton the land is generally flat and the steepest gradient only 1 in 100.  The Gilbert is crossed on a girder bridge of 60 ft span.  A similar bridge is needed about a mile beyond Riverton where the Gilbert is crossed again.  At 13½ miles a tributary requires another bridge of 45 ft span.  [Further culverts etc. are then described to Manoora.]

Between Manoora and Farrell’s Flat the line encounters the most challenging cuttings and embankments.  A double 30 ft span crosses the Wakefield.  Despite the more broken country the maximum gradient has been kept to 1 in 91, but there are more of such gradients in this section.  [Further details of culverts, cuttings and embankments are given.]

Including Tarlee eight stations have been erected on the line at an average interval of six miles.  Tarlee has a stationmaster’s house and shed accommodation.  Riverton will be the changing station, 31¾ miles from Roseworthy and 39 from Aberdeen.  It is furnished with two platforms and a proportionate length of shelter.  At Saddleworth a combination shed will serve both passengers and goods.  Manoora and Mintaro both get a house, though the latter scarcely deserves its name, being some 4 miles from the town.  Farrell’s Flat has a residence and extra length of shed.  Daviestown [Hanson] gets only a siding for now.  At Aberdeen, being the terminus, there will have to be more facilities.  Besides the ordinary accommodation for goods and passengers, there will have to be shelter for rolling stock, an engine shed, a turntable, and an extra length platform.  The latter will measure 300 ft and the goods shed will have a maximum length of 100 ft.  The contractors are presently vigorously prosecuting this work.

The permanent way has been laid with rails of 40 lb per yard.  The engineer would have preferred 60 lb rail, but it has been made uniform with the line to Roseworthy.  Effort has been made to ensure maximum solidity by using sleepers of picked gum from Glen Para, 9 ft x 9 inches and 4½ inches thick, spaced at 2 ft 4 inches and well packed on hard stone ballast.  [Further details are given.]
