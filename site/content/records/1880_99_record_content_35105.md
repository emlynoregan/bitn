Editorial on the Town Council.  The editor agrees with the decision to increase the Health Rate from 3d to 3½d and the Park Lands Rate from 2d to 3d.  The General rate remained at 1/-.  These changes are needed as there is now no Government subsidy.  This year there is also £200 in bonds to redeem.  He reiterates his view that the town was ‘got at’ by the Government with respects to the Waterworks.

About a year ago the Government controlled the Waterworks and were receiving from ratepayers about £900 p.a. and were so extravagant in their modus operandi that the Council thought it would be better for them to pay the Government interest on the cost of construction and work it themselves.  In this they were so successful when using the Government rates they were able to generate a surplus whereupon at the start of this year they decided to reduce the rate.  Up to the end of last year the rate was 12½% up to £40 (Minimum £10, up to which value all paid 25/- per annum.)  Over £40 to £100 was 5% and over £100 it was 2½%.  Cr Hardy introduced a scheme that all assessments other than vacant lands be rated at a minimum 10/- up to £10.  £10 to £40 be rated at 10% and over £40 be the same as last year.

When this was rejected as yielding too little income Cr Rabbich suggested that up to £10 be rated 7½%, £10 to £40 be at 12½% and over £40 be as before.
