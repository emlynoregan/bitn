New Councillor.  Contrary to the usual courtesy when all Councillors assemble for the swearing in of a new member of Council, on Tuesday night, 9 October, when W.H. Hardy was sworn only Cr Parks was present and a JP had to be hunted up.  The new Councillor received a cool reception at the Council meeting on 15 October.
