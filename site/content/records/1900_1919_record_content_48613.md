Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting, Burra Institute, Monday 27 November.

About 50 attended with Mr Winnall in the chair.

The Mayor’s report was read and adopted.

The Mayor said he had neglected to mention the removal of the railway fence and the straightening of the road near the Bon Accord Hotel.  He said he had done his best and thrown his weight behind the patriotic efforts.  The Council had worked as a happy family with some differences of opinion, but no bickering.  The town was badly lighted, but it could not be improved without raising the rate.  Dead Man’s Bridge was an eyesore and a danger and he would like to see the road straightened.

When the candidates were invited to speak J.E. Greenwood said nothing about policies.  J.E. Harris thought that decreasing the general rate and increasing the lighting rate might have advantages.  Dead Man’s Bridge needed something done and the Pig & Whistle crossing needed a bridge.

All Councillors and candidates favoured doing something at the Pig & Whistle.

There was also an idea of doing something at Gully’s Wharf, but the north end and south end Councillors had different views on that.  Cr McWaters would oppose any bridge there and Mr Greenwood agreed with him.

Mr J.E. Pearce expressed dissatisfaction with the amount of tar paving in the main street in Kooringa.

Cr Radford thought that North Ward deserved more than its four lamps – they contributed one third of the rates.

Things were admittedly limited at present, as carbide had doubled in price.

Soldiers’ Aid Society sent £20 last week to a large military hospital in England (with 1,600 beds) where many Australians were being treated.  The total fund was now £522-9-11.
