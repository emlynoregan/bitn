Annual St Joseph’s Bazaar in aid of the heavy church debt was held on Friday and Saturday under most favourable conditions.  Attendance was not high on the opening day, but raffles raised considerable money.  Saturday evening saw the best attendance.  Over £90 was raised at the bazaar and the concert and dance raised about £25.  The 8th report of the Rt Rev. James Maher of the Diocese of Pt Augusta said Kooringa was ‘one of our greatest burdens’ due to the small sprinkling of Catholics in the community.  Rev. J.P. Redden, till his illness, and then Rev. W. O’Dowling, did all they could to meet the year’s demands and raised £71-16-3 for the term.  The debt stands at £1,157-15-11.  The property as it now stands cost some time ago over £5,000.
