BCS.  Principal Rob Knight has resigned and will take a seven-year appointment as Principal of Clare H.S. in 2006.  Prior to his three years at BCS, he was Principal of East Murray Area School.  Next year Gus Wenzel will step up from Deputy Principal to Interim Principal and Sue Ryan & Roger Boehm will be Assistant Principals.  [These temporary arrangements were necessary because union rules prevented the Principal’s position being advertised over the school holidays.]

Alison Collins is Junior School Co-ordinator.

Terry Swan is Senior School Co-ordinator.

Peter Giles is Middle school Co-ordinator.

Burra Senior Citizens were presented with a KESAB award in recognition of their outstanding long-term contribution to Burra over 25 years.

Burra Leisure Activity Group had a mystery trip on Friday 2 December.  They ended up at the Royal Coach Motel in Adelaide for Christmas Dinner and an evening of entertainment from ‘The Three Tenors’.  Arrival back in Burra was at 2.45 a.m.

‘Lab Rats’ – the newly formed local band, will play their first gig at the Bon Accord Hotel this Saturday.  Founding member is Stephanie Crowley, an ex-Burra patriot.  [Others are not named.]
