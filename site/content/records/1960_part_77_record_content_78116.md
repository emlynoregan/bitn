BCS will launch the first Community School Week 15-19 March.  For that week the normal program will be suspended.  Special student courses related to the curriculum will be held from 9-11 a.m. and for the rest of the day mini-courses on a wide variety of subjects will be held for both students and adults.  Courses are free except for any materials used.  Courses are being supported by Sturt CAE and the Clare Further Education Centre as well as by the school staff and community volunteers.  For the students work experience has also been arranged.  Added to the student program are the Year 8 camp at Barmera and a Year 12 visit to Adelaide tertiary education centres and some Festival of Arts productions.  Unfortunately this week clashes with Field Day Week and in future this will be avoided.
