Foresters’ Demonstration, Boxing Day.

The weather was unfavourably hot with a searing north wind and clouds of dust, but this did not deter crowds of people from making their way to Princess Royal.  Two first-class tracks had been laid out for the footmen and the wheelmen.

The main footrace was the Burra Handicap over 130 yds, which was won by R.C. Lock.  (£12)

The main bicycle race was the Burra Handicap over 1 mile, which was won by S. Mutton.  (£10)

Other results are printed.

The entertainment at the Institute in the evening drew a good audience despite the heat.

Accidents: none very serious.

M. Ryan was run over by a cab in Market Square on Christmas Eve and is progressing favourably.

T. Parks jun. received a nasty cut to his head from a falling case at Bath & Pearce’s store where he works.

Mr O’Connor received a nasty kick from a horse he was watering at the Market Square trough on Christmas morning.

Mr Henderson was returning from the Foresters’ Picnic in a trap with two other gentlemen when the whole thing collapsed in Ayers St, throwing all of them out onto the road.  All were badly shaken and the trap smashed.

Fire.  On Christmas Day a fire broke out on Mr W. McBride’s paddock at Firewood Creek, two miles north of Burra.  It travelled the length of his paddocks and into grass country near the hills and ran towards Mt Bryan.  It was fought by many volunteers before being stopped at a road.  It is thought to have been started by the midday passenger train.

Rev. H.T. Burgess’s Christmas sermon is printed.
