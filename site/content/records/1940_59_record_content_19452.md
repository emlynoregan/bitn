The Mayor queried whether any boy or girl in the town was eligible to play on the courts.

Cr Harvey said that recently a basketball association was formed and competitive matches held on the school courts.  He was given to understand that competitive tennis would also be held.

Cr Kellaway was sympathetic, but wary of setting a precedent for other sports.  Also it did not embrace the Primary School.  Council should carry out repairs at cost price.

Cr Kellaway moved an amendment that the Courts be repaired at cost price.

The amendment was carried on the casting vote of the Mayor.
