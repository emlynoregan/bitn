The Fathers’ Assoc. & the Ladies Auxiliary require funds to carry on their work of supporting returned men.

Burra Rifle Club has fired the 4th stage of ‘The Gap’ Trophy.  A.G. Heinrich scored a possible over 700 yards, but the best handicap results were from G. Webster, J. Lloyd & I. Burdon.

Weather.  Rain fell to the east this week.  Falls were erratic and varied from 26 points at Sturt Vale through 65 at Old Koomooloo and 84 at Braeside to 130 at Poonunda.  Burra received 80 points, but Mt Bryan recorded only 21 and Booborowie a mere 6.

J. Lawrie writes about the ‘Death Trap Road’ south of Burra.  He considered the road quite safe if driven with the necessary care.  The editor however, said he believed the road could hardly be safe when new, old and middle-aged cars have tipped over on it, when under the control of good and bad drivers.
