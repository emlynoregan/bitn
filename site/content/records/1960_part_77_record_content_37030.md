Dedication of St John’s Lutheran Church, Burra.

Visitors from other mid-northern Lutheran Congregations combined with members of the Burra congregation, representatives of other denominations and other special guests for the dedication of St John’s Evangelical Lutheran Church at Burra North by Pastor G.O. Minge, President of the SA District of the Lutheran Church of Australia.  Incidentally, his first public sermon was preached on Christmas Day 1922 at Mt Bryan.  The church has seating for 80, or at a pinch 100, and about as many had to remain outside to hear the service over a loud speaker.  Participating in the service was Pastor Thiele of Saddleworth, a former pastor to the Burra congregation and Pastor Schmidt, the present pastor.  Mrs Zweck of Blyth played the organ and the small but effective Blyth Choir led the singing.  Pastor Thiele thanked the Anglicans for the use of their hall in recent years and Rev. Sibly of St Mary’s gave greetings from Anglican parishioners.  Monsignor Hughes spoke on behalf of the Roman Catholics and thanked the congregation for inviting him to be present.  Pastor Schmidt said members of the Burra congregation were overwhelmed by the attendance and that to date the undertaking was debt-free.  He thanked all helpers and donors very sincerely.  Afternoon tea was served in the RSL Hall.  The next service at St John’s will be on 19 November at 9 a.m.   [The photograph of the church before it was moved from Mansfield Park is reprinted.]
