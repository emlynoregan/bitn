Burra Town Council, 2 October

The Local Government Department considers the present signage about the detour due to bridge work as adequate.  The bridge would be repaired by the end of October and Redruth Bridge by Christmas.

The headmaster of the school Mr A.T. Tuck had been unable to identify any culprits for tree destruction, but had lectured all pupils on the problem.

Unpaid rates:	North Ward	£19-16-1

East Ward	£18-0-10

West Ward	£22-9-0

Cr Dow said the guns in Market Square required attention.  They needed concrete blocks under the wheels and a coat of paint and plates explaining where they were captured and by whom.

[This is puzzling and presumably an error, perhaps for ‘the guns from Market Square’: there is no mention of the guns having been returned to Market Square from Lewis Gardens.]
