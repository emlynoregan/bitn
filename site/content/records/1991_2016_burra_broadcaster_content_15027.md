Goyder Council

Decided to demolish the original toilet block at the Burra Town Hall, where the cutting in the hill on three sides of the hall will be battened, stabilised with bitumen and a safety fence installed along the new edge.  Earth Levels adjacent to the hall are to be excavated to below damp course level and a report on the roof iron made prior to obtaining a costing for any needed re-roofing.

[This work, other than the demolition of the toilets, would appear not to have been carried out despite this resolution.]

The final draft and comments on Market Square and Best Place Concept Plan and the Works Practices Policy are to be forwarded to the Works Committee prior to being presented to Council for adoption.

Council decided to allow the relocation to Burra Art Gallery of the Mayoral paintings and photographs depending on the Main Street Committee’s decision on Management of the Town Hall.

Burra Paint ʼn’ Panel owners A.D. & K.A. Eldredge have been granted permission to erect a paint spray booth, subject to conditions laid down by the Environmental Protection Authority.

SA Ambulance Centre has been given permission to extend the Burra Ambulance Centre.

Council deferred a decision on granting $10,000 to the Burra National Trust for Burra Promotions pending further information.
