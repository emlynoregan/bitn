Kooringa News, 4 July

We have been inundated with a great number of turnips from experimental planting that proved extremely successful.  They could possibly be exploited as stock feed.

Mr MacDermott, the new Stipendiary Magistrate, commenced duties last week.

The continuation of beautiful weather and the promising appearance of green vegetation on all sides has contributed to much better lambing success this year than in recent seasons.
