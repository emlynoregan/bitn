Burra Town Council

Cr Button was welcomed, replacing Cr Kuchenmeister who resigned recently.

Rubbish to be moved from Mrs Howell’s old home, as the mullock was encroaching on the footpath.

Various minor works were approved.

There was discussion on the recent accident to a child at ‘The Guns’. The overseer said that when placed there the guns had been secured with wire and an iron stay, but a mob had removed the restraint and apparently tried to overturn the gun.

The Government will not allow outside stock access to the sale at Booborowie Experimental Farm.  Lewis and Medlow will be approached about the sale of the Council’s horse.
