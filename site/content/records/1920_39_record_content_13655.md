Burra Town Council 5 July

R. Fuss wrote re the balcony of the Royal Exchange Hotel.  An electric pole needs shifting.  Owners and contractors are prepared to pay £4 of the £10 required and advise the Council to come to an agreement with the Electric Co.  Cr Kellaway feared the precedent.  Cr Riggs thought the balcony would beautify the town and so Council should comply.  Cr Hammond agreed.  Electric Co. to be approached.

E. Pearce & F. Treloar tender their resignations as auditors as the Council has refused to raise their fees.  Cr Kellaway moved acceptance.

Cr Riggs moved an amendment that the resignations not be accepted.

Cr Hammond moved an amendment that E. Pearce’s be accepted as his term ended in Nov., but that F. Treloar be advised of the provision of the Act.  [i.e. of a possible £25 forfeiture fee.]

Cr Woollacott moved that their fees be raised £6-6-0

Cr Hammond withdrew his amendment which had not been 2nd.

The Riggs amendment was then put and Riggs & Hammond were for, with Harris & Kellaway against.  Cr Woollacott refused to vote on the grounds he was for neither the amendment nor the motion.

The Mayor then threatened to fine him for refusing to vote.

The Town Clerk looked up the relevant by-law and found the fine was £5.

Cr Woollacott persisted & Cr Hammond pointed out that his solution was to vote against both the amendment and the motion and after some continuation of the impasse Cr Woollacott eventually did that.

The amendment was carried on the casting vote of the Mayor.

[Unless the Mayor had a deliberative as well as a casting vote this doesn’t seem to be necessary.]
