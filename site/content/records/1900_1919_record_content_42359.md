Bob Voumardt, well-known local drover has had a run of bad luck this year, losing dogs to the value of £70 to cars, poisoning and distemper.  On Saturday week last he lost most of his camp equipment when his tent blew onto the fire while he was out checking the sheep.  He narrowly saved the dray which was beginning to burn.  His loss here was c. £50.

Fire.  At the pictures on Saturday night at the Institute someone seems to have deliberately set fire to the scenery.  It was discovered before it did much damage, but it did cause people to leave the hall, fortunately without panic.
