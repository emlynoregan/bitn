Kooringa News, 16 April

Accident.  A 15-year-old son of Mr W.H. Broad of Sod Hut Ranges was walking with a mule team on the Adelaide Road near Mr Bock’s on 12 April.  He was climbing onto a wagon while the mules were stationary when they suddenly moved forward and he was thrown to the ground.  The wheels passed over his foot, ankle and part of his leg, completely crushing them and then passed over his wrist.  The victim was taken to Dr Mayne and Dr Dashwood and the leg was immediately amputated.  The arm has not yet been amputated.

Despite contrary reports many people have passed through en route to the Barrier Ranges.  Some say the diggings are actually at Cooper’s Creek.

The weather recently has produced warm genial showers.

Out of work miners are finding work on Government roads and the railway construction.  The lambing season is also creating jobs.

The proprietors have taken up a lease on the cobalt mine near Booborowie.
