W. Peel Nesbit MB, MRCPE, writes an article on The People’s Problem.  This was, he said, to obtain a Government which, in obedience to the sense of justice of the majority of mankind, provides for everyone within its jurisdiction as great a measure of liberty as possible: liberty in thought, in speech, in action.

[This is of interest since he was a regular contributor to the town’s life and its debates when the paper started in 1876.]
