Streetlights.  A group of boys made their own comment on the problems with street lamps when they knocked the bottom out of two gin bottles and put a candle in each.  One the stuck ‘up a tree’ at Henderson’s Corner and put the other in the lamp near the Institute.  They burned well until M-c Grosser made then take their lights down.

The new lights have clearly failed to meet requirements.  Acetylene lamps seem to be the only solution to the failure of the arc and ‘Best’ lamps, which were simply a waste of money.  Night after night they fail completely within an hour of being lit.
