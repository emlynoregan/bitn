Roaring 40s have recently announced debt problems and has never turned a profit.  This comes as no surprise to Inspiration Point Wind Farm Awareness spokesperson Ally Fricker, who says the wind farm developments in the Mid North have been poorly though through and researched.  [She outlines the groupâ€™s objections to wind farms, as previously noted.]
