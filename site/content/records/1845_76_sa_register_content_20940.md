Kooringa News, 24 July

A Chess Club has been formed here with about 16 members.  Mr Goodhart is the secretary.

Burra Grammar School has recommenced operations with vigour.  Mr Stanton has agreed to stay as head for six months.  There are more pupils now the school is self supporting than when it had guarantors.

Princess Royal Mine continues to offer promise and 25 men are at work.  Another discovery was made last Tuesday.  It is a great pity that capital cannot be found for the venture.
