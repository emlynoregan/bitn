Red Cross Children’s Gala, Fancy Dress Frolic and Dance

Burra’s three Red Cross units joined in this major patriotic effort on 30 October.  A baby competition was held in the weeks leading up to the event.  The day started with a Children’s Tea Party in the, opened by the Mayoress, Mrs T.H. Woollacott.  There were stalls around the hall and a buffet afternoon tea was served on one side.  The tea party for pre-school aged children was full of delectable fare and each child received a balloon.  A peanut hunt followed, with a prize for the person gathering the most nuts.

The Baby Competition raised £115-15-11:

Robert Lott	£36-18-5

Bruce Pontifex	£31-6-5

Timothy Draysey	£17-1-9

Warren Murdoch	£13-13-9

Patricia Bailey	£8-14-4

Robert Barrett	£8-1-3

The winner received a silver mug.  Each participant received a mug donated by Mrs John Tennant.

The Children’s Plain & Fancy Dress Frolic ran from 7 to 9 p.m.  [Prize winners are listed.]

Dancing got underway by about 9.30 p.m. with a good crowd in attendance.

Just before supper a large Union Jack presented by Mrs A. Tennant was auctioned on the Bugler system and then finally sold right out.  It bore the autographs of Lady Muriel Barclay-Harvey and Mr Edmonds of Adelaide Red Cross.  In all this raised £164-5-0, with the flag finally going to Mr Roy Wigley with a bid of £50.  Other competitions were also held.  The final total raised was just over £350.
