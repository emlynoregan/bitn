The Nepabunna Trip by Grade VI & VII children from Burra School began on 15 October.  Their accommodation was the shearers’ quarters at Angepena Station.  Two teachers went: Mr Allan & Mrs Carpenter and a group of parents: Mr I. Allen, Mr A. Nankivell, Mrs J. O’Connor and Mrs C. Taylor.

[The children then take up the story, which runs for 3⅓ columns.]

Monday: to Angepena Station, stopping at Melrose, Hawker and Parachilna.

Tuesday: visit to the Nepabunna Mission and the gorge and rock pool.

Wednesday: visit to Nepowie Springs and a camp concert in the shearing shed.

Thursday: to Nepabunna and played sports and in the afternoon to see the Malki cave paintings some 8 miles from Nepabunna, involving a two mile walk.  There was heavy rain and then a social at night.

Friday: return to Burra with stops at Copley, Parachilna, Hawker and Peterborough.
