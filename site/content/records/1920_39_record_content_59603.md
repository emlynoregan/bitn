Miss Truby King visited Burra on 31 December 1935.  She is the only daughter of Sir Truby King of New Zealand, the founder of the Plunket Mothercraft Centre and Baby Clinic.  When Miss King was in Adelaide on a visit, Matron Siegele contacted Mrs I.J. Warnes with the result that the CWA asked Miss King to visit Burra.  Burra is the first country branch of a Baby Health Clinic in SA to be fully equipped on the lines laid down by Sir Truby King.  The CWA was truly very gratified when Miss King accepted the invitation to visit on 31 December.  Miss King and accompanying visitors were entertained at lunch and then visited the Maternity Wing at the Burra Hospital.  Miss King was very pleased with all she saw.  Following afternoon tea Miss King gave an interesting résumé of her father’s life and work in New Zealand.
