The Mayor said he had no doubt the water had been deviated by the fencing of the Recreation Ground.  He thought a committee should be appointed to visit and deal.

Cr Sampson said a dozen committees had done so.

Cr O’Leary supported lowering the ford if it would serve.  If the offer of Messrs Lockyer & Lewis had been accepted they would have spent £90 instead of £23 going to lawyers.

Cr Sampson asked what was the object in lowering the ford?

The mayor: to allow water to escape so quickly no overflow would occur.  It could be done for £3.

Cr Sampson said: No - not for £10.

He then moved the matter be left with the Public Works Committee to deal with and that they interview Mr Lewis.

Cr O’Leary moved a lamp be placed at the most convenient spot near Henderson’s Bridge.  Carried.  [i.e. The Kingston St Bridge.]
