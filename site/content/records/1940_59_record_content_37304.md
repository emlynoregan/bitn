Air Force Association Ball was held on Friday evening at Burra Town Hall.  The hall decorations were outstanding.  A huge silver aeroplane, complete with navigation lights and a realistic pilot was suspended from the ceiling.  Flags, balloons and humorous cartoons reflecting RAAF life festooned the walls.  Darrel Field’s Band supplied the music.  [Details in ⅔ column.]
