Obituary.  Mary Williams was the fourth daughter of the late Charles and Elizabeth Evans of Riverton.  The family of five daughters was cared for by their kindly father after Mary’s mother died when she was nine.  Mary was educated at Tothill’s Creek, Tothill’s Belt and Riverton High School and then went to Adelaide Teachers’ College.  She was gifted at needlework.  She taught at small schools in the vicinity of Pinaroo, Frances, Hawker, Warooka and Kadina until her marriage in 1936 to Maurice Williams of Carrieton at St Agnes Church, Marrabel.  The couple lived at Baldina Downs and later in Burra.  There were three daughters and four sons, but only the eldest lived beyond very early infancy.  Mary was a relief teacher at Burra Primary School in the 1950s and assisted when health and family commitments allowed in Burra Rural Youth and at St Joseph’s Church and School.  Her husband died in 1866 and two of her sister, Essie Evans and Olive Hansbery, also predeceased her.  She became incapacitated in august 1974 and was cared for at Burra Hospital until her death on 31 May 1975.
