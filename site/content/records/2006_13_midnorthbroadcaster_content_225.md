An Intensive Week-long Farming Course ‘Grazing for Profit’ was held in Burra last week.  This was the third year such a course had been run by Resource Consigning Service and it was facilitated by Chris Scheid.  It was designed to cover all aspects of farming including: production management, regenerative land use practices and business designing to reduce costs.  There were about 20 delegates from across the state.  Burra delegate, Ben Tiver said it was well worth attending.
