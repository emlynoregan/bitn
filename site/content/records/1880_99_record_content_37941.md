The Great Strike has spread widely.  Men on strike are said now to number 6,000 in Sydney, 7,000 in Melbourne, >4,000 in Newcastle, 3,000 in Queensland, 2,000 in Adelaide, 5,000 in New Zealand and thousands more in Broken Hill, Tasmania and elsewhere.  The colliery strikes have been particularly disruptive.  Non-Union labour has been attacked as have the police.  Special constables are being called for.  The news from Broken Hill is that all mines are shut down and the smelting operations.  There are about 10,000 men employed on the Barrier.  [This was not a strike but a lockout by owners who resented financial aid to the strike from the miners.  See Jim Moss Sound of Trumpets, Wakefield Press, 1985 for a brief account of the effect of this strike in SA]
