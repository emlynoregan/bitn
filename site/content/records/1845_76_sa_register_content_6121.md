SA Elections: Mr Mildred at Burra

Mr Mildred the candidate for Stanley & Gawler entered the room at 5 p.m.

Dr Bull was voted into the chair and Mr Mildred spent some time describing his views on civil and religious liberty, education, no state aid to religion, the ballot, universal suffrage, triennial Parliaments, and state economy.

Mr Mortlock moved that Mr Henry Mildred was a fit and proper person to represent and that he be requested to become a candidate for the District of the Burra.’

Mr Taylor gave a rambling speech in seconding the motion.

Mr Mann spoke to comment on both the seconder and Mr Mildred.  He accused the seconder of inconsistency in supporting universal suffrage and then objecting to the names of 168 persons on the roll.  Mr Mildred, he said, had not referred to Mr Kingston’s position while outlining his own and that was because Mr Kingston’s liberal views had long been known.  Why was he now an eleventh hour candidate?  He had failed to explain this and that made him unsuited as a candidate.  One thing alone rendered Mr Kingston the better candidate; Mr Kingston was a large Burra proprietor and Director; Mr Mildred had no interest or knowledge of the Mine.  The prosperity of the people of Burra was synonymous with the success of the Burra Burra Mine.  Knowledge of the Mine was essential for their representative, etc, etc.

The Chairman interrupted to ask if it was his intention to propose an amendment.

Dr Bull eventually ruled Mr Mann was not in order.

Mr Pollock [sic: for Pollitt] the Anglican minister then asked some questions while Mr Mann retired to fetch Mr Kingston.

After an interval Mr Kingston appeared with Mr Mann, Captain Finniss and other friends.

Mr Kingston said his position was well known, but he would answer any questions.  He was surprised the Mr Mildred had allowed Kingston’s actions to have been misrepresented without attempting to contradict the statements that had been made.  The meeting then dissolved into uproar and squabbling for about half an hour.

Mr Mortlock then rose and asked Kingston as to his opinion on the right to discoverers of mineral wealth to a reward.

Kingston said he thought the present law unfair, but its remedy was a more difficult question.  If elected ‘he would use every effort to procure for the discoverers of our mineral treasures, and particularly for miners, his just reward.’

This was followed by loud and protracted cheering, in the midst of which Dr Bull vacated the chair in favour of Mr Mortlock.

Dr Bull then asked Kingston if he was a supporter ‘of that tyrannous and oppressive imposition called the Miners’ Relief Fund, which takes 6d per week away from that which the miner earns by the sweat of his brow, to pay an officer appointed by yourself, and which refuses him the right to have…’

Here the storm burst and little of what the speaker said could be heard.  He was heard to say that he had the names of 100 miners opposed to the fund.

He was called upon to name some and he named a miner recently dead.  ‘A living witness.’ Was called for as the tumult increased.

Dr Bull rushed to the top of the table and at the top of his voice said to Mr Kingston, ‘I say it is robbery; I say it is a swindle.’

Mr Kingston immediately retorted ‘You are a liar.’

This brought the meeting to an abrupt conclusion.  Mr Mortlock vacated the chair.  Dr Bull disappeared amidst the angry crowd and Mr Kingston retired with his friends, his supporters greeting him with hearty cheers.
