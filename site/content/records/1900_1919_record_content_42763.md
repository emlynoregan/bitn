Farewell to Our Boys.  The Institute was practically full on Saturday at 3 p.m. for a farewell to another batch of our volunteers.  E.W. Crewes presided.  Since the inception of the Burra Cheer-up Society no volunteer has left without a gathering to wish him well.  Rev. Bloyd spoke after Mr Crewes.  Mr Winnall then made an impressive speech and Lieut. McBride responded.  Lieut. Kidman, as a visitor, also spoke briefly.

[Strangely the volunteers are neither numbered nor named.]
