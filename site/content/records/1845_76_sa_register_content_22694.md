SA Mining Association.  We believe that at the coming meeting of the company the Directors will propose the opening of an office in London where information can be obtained and a register of shares kept, with provision being made for the transfer of shares and payment of dividends.  It will also be proposed that the declared value of the capital will be £61,000 divided into 12,320 shares of £5 each, five of which will be awarded to the holders of each of the existing 2,464 shares in exchange for and in lieu thereof.  By a new deed of settlement power will be reserved to increase the capital to £100,000by the issue of new shares.
