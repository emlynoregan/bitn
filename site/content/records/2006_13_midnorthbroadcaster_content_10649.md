BRTBA is facing a challenging year according to President Peter Edson.  The possibility of holding major events is well worth considering.  He said BRTBA’s most significant role was the management of the Burra Visitor Centre, which last year has 28,000 visitors through its doors and booked $260,000 worth of accommodation.  The BVC’s facilities are clearly quite inadequate compared with those in other centres. A challenge for this year is therefore the updating or relocation of the Visitor Centre. In the event that Phoenix Copper was granted exploration rights in the Mine area BRTBA would have to work closely with it to ensure the community and tourism benefited from the activity.  Road signage on roads leading to the town was another issue.  He reminded people that it was not necessary to own a business to become involved with BRTBA, anyone with ideas, visions and energy were most welcome to attend the AGM, scheduled for Tuesday 31 August.
