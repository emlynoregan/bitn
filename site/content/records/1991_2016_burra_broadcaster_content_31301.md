Goyder Safe Community.  An informal meeting of people interested in the health and safety of the community resulted in a unanimous ‘Yes’ to the establishment of a Goyder Safe Community Group.  An invitation is extended to community groups and individuals to come to the next meeting, which will be held in the Council meeting room at Burra 2 p.m. 30 July.  [Just over a column of detail is printed on the background and aims of Safe Communities.]
