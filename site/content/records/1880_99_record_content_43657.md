Burra United Friendly Societies’ Sports were held at the Recreation Ground on Boxing Day.  These were the second such and some good prize money was on offer.  The Sheffield Handicap over 135 yards offered prizes of £20, £6, £3, & £1, while the Sheffield Bicycle Handicap over one mile offered £7-7-0, £2-2-0, & £1-1-0.

A good track was prepared for the cyclists.

There was a large procession at 9 a.m. from the Institute with the Lodges being given a guard of honour by the mounted Infantry.

There were considerable complaints about the handicapping system.  The events that were handicapped locally were very satisfactory.

In the afternoon the crowd was estimated at 1,500.

The report covers about ⅔ column and results spread over 1¼ columns.

[Two events offer a bit of a puzzle.  What was involved in lemon cutting?  And what was cock in a box?  The prize for the latter was ¼ bag of flour and a cock with the runner-up getting 2 lb of tea.]

The Burra Brass Band supplied music through the day and a Grand Concert in the Institute in the evening rounded off the event.

Chairs and forms were placed in the aisles for this (which should not have been done).

Once again we must thank Mr J. Roach for bringing talent from Adelaide for the concert - several ladies and gentlemen at his own expense.
