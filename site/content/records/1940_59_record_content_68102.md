Burra Town Council, 16 May

Permission was granted to subdivided sections 23, 24 & pt 33.

The engineer, Mr Cockburn, inspected the two swing bridges.  He said the one opposite the town Hall was unsafe and should remain closed.  To replace it with a similar type would cost about Â£3,000.

The Burra North Bridge was not safe either, but could possibly be made safe by adding concrete piers and using strong railway irons.
