Capt. Mavis Riggs & FO Jack McWaters attended a Welcome Social.  PO Woodgate regretted not being able to be there due to his duties.  Capt. Riggs had served five years, first in the Middle East and then in the jungles of Northern Australia.  She had been one of the first to be farewelled in 1939.

FO McWaters had been an air-gunner in the RAAF in England fighting the Luftwaffe and had been on many bombing raids over enemy territory.  Speeches were made by the Mayor & A.L. Bence for the RSL.  The two guests responded.  Dancing continued till midnight.
