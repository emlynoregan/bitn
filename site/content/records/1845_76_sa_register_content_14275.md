Election Notices

G.S. Kingston inserts an advertisement accepting ‘numerously-signed and flattering requisitions’ that had asked him to come forward and stand for the House of Assembly at the forthcoming elections.

John Clark inserts an advertisement saying he will present himself for election to the House of Assembly ‘not so much to represent the Burra and Clare as to strike high for the political and social elevation of the working man’.
