Obituary & Inquest before J.D. Cave JP at the Commercial Hotel on the death of the child of Mrs McNeil.  [Donald Paul McNeill born 15 November 1873: died 14 September 1878.]
Mrs McNeil said the child, who was 5-6 years old, was standing on a sofa trying to reach something from a nearby cupboard when he fell across a piece of wood in the fireplace. She picked him up, held him and scolded him, then briefly left him, only to return and find him on his knees on the bed, stooped. She asked him where the pain was and he pointed to his chest. She could not see any bruise and he died within twenty minutes. 
Dr Nesbitt said there were no marks or bruises on the body, or other signs of violence. He was unable to give a cause of death — whether due to rupture of internal organs or to shock — probably the latter. A blow to the stomach can cause shock resulting in cessation of respiration. Verdict: accidental death.
