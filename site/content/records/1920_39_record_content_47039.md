Obituary.  Mary Woods died 30 July after a long illness.  She was a long time resident of Burra.  She leaves one daughter and two brothers, the Messrs Neidick.  Mr Paul Neidick was particularly attached to his sister and we extend sympathy to him.  [No trace in SA records of birth, marriage or death.  The surname is probably Neideck.]
