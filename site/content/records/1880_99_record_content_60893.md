Supreme Court Adelaide, 7 October.

George Parks was charge with forging and uttering a sick pay receipt in the name of J.H. Cockrum on 23 May 1896 for £2-16-0.  It was alleged he had appropriated the amount and then sought to make it up by deductions from the contributions of members.

J.H. Cockrum gave evidence that the signature was not his and he had not received any money.

The Treasurer, Hon. F.W. Holder & Rev. R.J. Daddow gave character references.

The defendant said he never signed a voucher for sick pay in his life.  He was ill at the time and his office was ransacked and things taken away he knew not of.

The jury found him not guilty.
