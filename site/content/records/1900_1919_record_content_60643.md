Burra Cheer-up Soc.

The Ladies’ band etc. met the train last Friday and welcomed Lieut. Bob Cock & Seaman ‘Wibby’ Vivian.  Lieut. Cock has been away almost five years.

On Saturday the Ladies’ band and a crowd gathered to meet five returning men, but were pleased when seven turned up: Tpr-Dvr A. Hopcraft, & Troopers W. Lines, C. Rabbich, S. Priess, C. Turner, A. Brandt & W. Brown.  (The last being the 5th Brown brother to return.)

On Monday evening the Ladies’ band and others greeted the return of: Tpr W.R. Edwards (of Copperhouse), & Ptes S. Jones, J. Highett & W. Hunt.  (The last named arrived, but silently vanished.)

‘Amicus’ writes calling for a calm and reverent approach to a war memorial as befits the subject.  The writer is not against halls, but feels that in addition some memorial devoted just to those who fell is also called for, one spot where each year we can place our wreaths and remember the sacrifice.

‘A Returned Soldier’ writes expressing disgust at Mr McLaren’s suggestion that a place to feast is a suitable memorial for the sacrifices made.  The remarks of ‘Esperanto’ he dismisses as an insult to a man’s intelligence and says most returned men support the Mayor’s idea of a monument in Market Square.

E.W. Crewes writes concerning the Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial.  He stresses that right from the start he had been supporting a memorial/statue to perpetuate and honour the memory of the fallen.  A letter asking the District Councils to appoint delegates for a meeting resulted in only the Burra and Booborowie delegates attending.  The Burra DC agreed to join in.  Booborowie has decided to erect a hall, but said we could expect some help from the people there.  Mt Bryan said they had also decided to erect a hall and so cannot join in.  I am given to understand that Hanson and Apoinga are prepared to do what they can to help.  I can hardly believe that any district would like to see a statue erected in Market Square and have the names of boys who fell belonging to that district omitted from the memorial.  The idea is to have a panel for each district.  I cannot conceive of a statue being erected unless it contained all the names.  A time has come for a start to be made and I appeal for donations and respectfully request the acknowledgement of the same in the Record.  Peace Day on or about 4 August will be a day for a special appeal for the memorial.

J. Allen writes explaining how he came to contact Mr Hall, thinking he had some standing in Peterborough football circles.

Burra Boy Scouts will not have a general meeting on Thursday, but patrol leaders and corporals will meet at the troop room to hang pictures etc.

[This appears to be the first published intimation that the use of the room as an Isolation Hospital is over.]

Burra Rifle Club.  For the first time in five years on Saturday there was a match with Leighton Rifle Club and Burra 727 defeated Leighton 719.
