Burra Rubbish Dump.  An anonymous invitation was extended to the Town Clerk and Councillors to attend a social gathering at the Council Dump.  The Council has long been aware of the untidiness of the dump, but it is due to ratepayers who insist on dropping their rubbish where they like, rather than in the designated place. The Council will cover the existing mess and appeals to people not to dump rubbish outside the official site.
