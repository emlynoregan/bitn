Mongolata Goldfield

There was a meeting on Friday at the Eastern Telephone Building to organise and take precautions against fire at the diggings.  It had been called by the Mt Bryan Firefighting Committee and the Chairman of the DC Mr I.J. Warnes.  It was decided to appoint local controllers and get a dozen beaters.  If a tank can be got Mr Barker said it could be left on his property.  Grass on the field was 18-24” high.  They discussed ploughing of firebreaks and burning breaks.  The DC will be requested to burn a break.  40-gallon tanks were considered big enough.  [These were intended to supply water for beaters.]  Ratepayers were requested to have four 4-gallon tins of water on hand in case of fire.  Tanks were recommended stationed at Morgan’s and Barker’s.
