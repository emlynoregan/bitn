Porter’s Lagoon Boat Club held its third annual meeting on Foundation Day 27 January.  Although the lake was fairly shallow it was a very successful meeting.  The improvements made were much appreciated and upwards of 1,000 people and 400 cars attended.  In addition to the athletic and aquatic events there were sideshows and the Point Pass Brass Band, but they did not play frequently enough with an hour or so between items.  Officials were: Patron, W.G. Hawke; President, H.C. Atkins; Vice-Presidents, E.B. I’Anson & W. Carter and Hon. Sec. & Treasurer, A.J. Smith.
