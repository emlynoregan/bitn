Dr Sangster Sen. had attended the child, but refused a death certificate, being unsure of the cause of death and also ‘in consequence of certain reports which I heard as to the care of the child’.  The post mortem showed the baby weighed 8¼ lb, had no signs of violence and an unusual absence of fatty tissue with pale muscles.  Believed the cause of death was marasmus accelerated by diarrhoea.  [i.e. wasting away due generally to malnutrition.]
