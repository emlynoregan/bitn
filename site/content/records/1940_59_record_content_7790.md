Letter.  Sgt J.H. Bagot writes to Mrs S. Hawker from the Western Desert.  Much of the letter deals with the climate, the landscape and an ideal beach, but he also describes air raids, saying that they have inflicted little real damage apart from some fragment wounds, due to the effectiveness of their Ack Ack.
