Burra Town Council.

Mr Pryor has taken over as lamplighter on the death of Mr Highett â€“ for the time being.

The Mayor said the lamps were very dirty and had not been cleaned properly and were being destroyed.  They are to be put in order.

[It appears from the discussion that lamps were not lighted on moonlight nights unless clouds made them necessary.]

Cr Radford moved that between September and March lamps not be lit for five nights before and three nights after a full moon.  Carried.  Cr McBride further moved they be lit at 9 p.m. to the end of March and then at 7.30 p.m.

Sympathy was extended to Mrs Highett.
