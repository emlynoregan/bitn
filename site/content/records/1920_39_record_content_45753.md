RSL Notes.  The Anzac Memorial Service on Sunday was one of the finest ever.  Burra Brass Band headed the parade.  The standard-bearer was Troop-leader Twist then Major R. Sexton and the President and Secretary followed by Mrs D. Keynes and the returned men.  Boy Scouts followed under L. Hann.  Rev. Hutchinson (late AIF) conducted the service aided by P.L. Rosman (C. of E.) and Capt. Faulds of the Salvation Army.  The Church Parade at Redruth Methodist Church was not so well attended by diggers, but the church was packed.
