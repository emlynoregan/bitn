Burra Swimming Pool

At the Town Council meeting of 8 February it was announced that the sum of £399-16-0 borrowed from the Savings Bank under Government Subsidy Scheme was in the bank.

The Mayor was surprised to see the papers had been signed in his absence from the last meeting.  They could not get started now and would have to pay six months interest.  The Council had mucked around for six or seven months.

Cr Worth resented the implication that the Councillors present had taken an unnecessary risk.  The proceedings were purely formal following a decision taken before Christmas.  A resolution had been passed that it would be proceeded with.  He had suggested at the time a delay until winter.  Either they had to start now or patch up the matter of the loan somehow.

The Mayor announced that the Council would go into committee and the door was shut, but no motion for this was moved.

His Worship resented the action of the Centenary Committee in granting the pool only £4.  Local Medical Officers intimated that under certain conditions the pool would not be healthy.

Cr Worth asked the Mayor his opinion about starting work.  He said he was not going to sacrifice his business to build a swimming pool and give up three months work for nothing.  All the Centenary Committee’s money – which he had worked so hard to raise – had gone somewhere else.

Cr worth said what Councillors wanted to know was that now the money was in their hands did His Worship want to go on with the pool or not, or should the Council rid itself of the loan and try to get it later?

The Mayor said he could not take on any more work at present.  He was beginning to feel the strain of Centenary Week and was sick up to the neck when he saw all the Centenary Committee money go elsewhere.  ‘He had been badly let down over it and had received insult after insult and misrepresentation.’

Cr Worth asked for particulars of this, but got no reply.

Cr Jennison was getting disgusted with the whole thing and sympathised with Cr Worth.

He and Councillor Dow had moved that the work be started as soon as the money was available and now the Mayor was not ready.  The longer it was put off the less chance there was of having it ready for next summer.  He asked if the Mayor thought it possible to get the baths built for £400 if tenders were called at once.

The Mayor said it was impossible to say.  Many bags of cement had been promised.

Cr Jennison was not in favour of giving up the money now they had it.  The Council could not go on indefinitely hanging the matter up.  Who is to say the Mayor was not going to have a big job next winter.  He moved that tenders be called as per plans and specifications, with Council to supply materials and tenders to be for labour only.

The Mayor said he had promised the loan of a cement mixer and brother’s tractor, but they might not be available when the work was in hand.

Cr Kellaway spoke in support of the motion.

The Mayor wished the project deferred.

Cr Jeffery was for delay, as he thought they could get some interest back by placing the money in the bank.

The Mayor said they had nothing to lose by delaying till mid-winter.

Cr Jeffery thought they did not have the solid backing of the people and moved an amendment that the money be invested till mid-winter.  This was not seconded.

The motion was put and carried.

[Cr Riggs had asked if a site had been chosen and was told one had been – but it is not mentioned where that was.]
