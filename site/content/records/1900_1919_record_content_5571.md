Theft.  Thomas Burns (5), Willie Henderson (6) and Norman Hammer (6) were found by M-C Grosser to have stolen two gold chains and a brooch from Mrs F. Careyâ€™s bedroom on Thursday.  On account of their ages she has declined to prosecute, but the boys say they fought over the spoils and in the scramble lost everything.  It is felt unlikely that they will repeat the offence, having been suitable frightened by M-C Grosser.
