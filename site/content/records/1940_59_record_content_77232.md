Burra Town Council

Burra & District Swimming Pool Committee asked the Council to make an application for a further subsidy of Â£1,500 for 1957-58 to enable completion of the swimming pool.  An application will be made.

Mr P.H .Quirke submitted a copy of a letter from the Minister of Works about the possible duplication of the Morgan-Whyalla pipeline.

A minute of appreciation was recorded for the work of the late A.A. Davey during his 67 years of association with the Burra Library and Town Hall.
