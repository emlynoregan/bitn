Annual Mayor’s Report for 1925

The roads and pathways are in very good order.

Expenditure was heavy, but good work has been done.

The assessment for 1925 was £16,630 and for 1926 is £16,954.  The value of new buildings is adding to the revenue each year.

Rates were reduced from 3/6 to 3/-. 

The small surplus at present will be used up in tarring the road between Kooringa and Aberdeen.

Parklands

Considerable improvements have been made with plantings of trees especially along the creek.  The children’s playground is well looked after and c. £25 was spent on the cycle track.

The Cemetery.

This is in good order.

The Fire Brigade

This has not been very busy.  The place is well kept and a siren has been installed this year.

Lighting

This is satisfactory and only finance prevents improvements.

Health

The town has been healthy without any form of epidemic, no doubt due to the cleanliness of the town.

Main Roads

The road from Kooringa to Aberdeen was badly in need of attention.  From the post office to St Just St (55½ chains) it was scarified and re-metalled.  No special grant was provided and the Council carried out the work for £647.  £246 was taken from the Government Grant and the rest from the general account.  This amount we hope to have refunded at a later date.  The Council now intends to tar-dress the whole length of the roadway.

‘Back to Burra’ was the most notable happening of the year.  It ran from 24-30 October.  Some hundreds of former residents paid visits and the town was beautifully decorated by day and night with welcome arches at the railway gate, the Institute and Lewis’s Bridge.  The week was filled with outings, concerts, dances, the show, sports and a ‘Back to School’ morning.  It was a great success and all who took part are to be congratulated.  The Burra Show was better than ever and the new grounds and appointments are a great asset.
