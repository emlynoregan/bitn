Editorial (again) on the need for a town water supply. The Govt. has indicated their adoption, subject to town consent of a plan to be met by a general rate. The Corporation favours one where only those using the water pay for it. Something is needed since in parts of the town water carts cannot nearly maintain the needed supply. The well expected to supply Kooringa has proved inadequate and more than probably the supply will have to come from the Bon Accord.
