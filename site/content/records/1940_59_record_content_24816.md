Obituary.  Mr R.D. (Dick) Pascoe has died after a long illness that confined him to his room and more recently to his bed.  In his younger days he was a keen rifle and gun shooter and even after retiring from active involvement, he took a keen interest in the sport and in the Burra Rifle Club.  He was also an enthusiast for coursing and was well involved when Burra ran coursing meetings.

[Richard Delbridge Pascoe, born 10 October 1866: died 14 January 1946.]
