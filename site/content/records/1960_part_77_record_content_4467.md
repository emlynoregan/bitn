Burra Small Bore Rifle Club

The Redbanks Show cleared £75 for the club.  The windy conditions raised so much dust, despite the application of hundreds of gallons of water that the go-kart demonstration had to be called off with only one kart making a few laps.  [The sports results are printed.]

On Tuesday’s shoot the best scorers over 75 yards were M. Thomas, J. Brown and R. Kellock.

On Sunday a team’s shoot at Morgan with Renmark, Riverton and Morgan was fired over 25, 50, 75 and 100 yards.  Aggregate results:		Morgan	2142

Riverton	2076

Burra 	2043

Renmark	1560
