SA Stockowners’ Association, Burra Branch

Retiring President E.L. McWaters.  After three dry years last year produced good rains for stock feed in the pastoral part of the district, but little water in the dams.  Getting suitable employees has become very difficult and it is very hard to pay them adequately.  Wool prices are very unsatisfactory and the situation with wheat (for those combining wheat and wool production) is also unsatisfactory.  I believe a nation-wide organisation is needed.  Elected: President, D.V .Lord; Vice-Presidents, F.H. Treweeke & R.R. Cooke; Joint Secretaries, A.L. Wright & R.L. Wuttke.
