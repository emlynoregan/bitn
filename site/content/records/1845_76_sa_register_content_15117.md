Kooringa News, 27 November

Rev. N. Bennett of Mintaro preached twice on Sunday in the Wesleyan Chapel on behalf of Wesleyan Foreign Missions.  A public meeting on Monday supported the same cause.

Rev. W. Davidson presented a lecture at the Institute yesterday evening on Hugh Miller, the Cromarty Mason.  It was announced that the Essay and Debating Society associated with the Institute would be inaugurated by Mr J. Burnell, who had undertaken to read an essay on Education.

Accident.  Mr H. Dawson, saddler, was riding a young horse up Commercial Street when it either shied or bucked, throwing the rider to the ground with some violence.  Mr Dawson was insensible for some time, but on his recovery it was found his injuries were not severe, though he was much shaken and is likely to feel the effects for some months.

During the week Mr G.E. Hamilton, Government Surveyor, with some assistants, has been surveying the line of main road through this township and Redruth.  I hope something will be done in the way of making as well as marking the road, lest our principal thoroughfare again present the same dismal spectacle next year as it hitherto has done as soon as the rains set in.

[Note that this survey resulted in the creation of the modern line of the main road to the northwest of Young Street; the road known as Watt Road.  The map below shows the original town survey and the new line of road shaded in.  It bears the note: â€˜Portions of the within Lots 36, 37, 59, 60, 61, 74, 75, 76, 90, 91, 116 & 117 have been taken for New Roads Vide confirmation of Road Order in Gazette of 28 August 1862.']

[Parts of lots 38, 39 & 40 were taken for road purposes later.]
