This year ten sat for Intermediate, two more sat for individual subjects to complete a certificate and two sat for Leaving.

Sport has seen considerable activity this year.  On 30 March we went to Clare for tennis and cricket.  The boys were easily defeated in cricket, but the girls suffered only a narrow loss in tennis.

On 13 April in the return matches the boys were again defeated, but the girls won the tennis 10 sets to 2.

This year a sports day for our own students was an innovation and was a great success.

Senior Boys’ Cup	Warren Mumme

Senior Girls’ Cup	Joy Bentley

Junior Boys’ Cup	Laurie Bevan

[There is no mention of a Junior Girls’ Cup]

In the Combined Mid-Northern High School Sports on 11 September at Clare, the shield went to Kapunda for their sixth successive win.

The Governor, Sir Winston Dugan, attended the Empire Day celebrations and presented the University Certificates [Intermediate and Leaving] to successful students and Minda Badges to those who had collected most for that institution.  The recently purchased House Shield was presented for the first time and the Jubilee Portrait of HM the King [George V] was unveiled.
