Burra Uniting Church held its annual Pancake Day last Tuesday.  Traditionally this activity on Shrove Tuesday used up the householdâ€™s fat, eggs and dairy produce before the start of lent and the time of abstinence associated with it.  Funds raised go towards helping families in need across Australia.
