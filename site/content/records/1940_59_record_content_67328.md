Burra Primary School Committee Annual Meeting

The Chairman, Mr M.G. Stockman, reported on a very successful year.  The energetic work of the Welfare Club greatly assisted.  The year saw the installation of the broadcast receiving set.  A sand pit was constructed and quite a lot of playground equipment was obtained.  The yard has been top dressed and partly bituminised.  A contract has been let for a new fence on the eastern side and we should soon see a new bike shed, luncheon room and cricket pitch.  Many young trees are thriving.  The Governor, Sir Robert George, visited during the year.
