Members of Burra RSL visited Berri over the weekend and spent an enjoyable time.  They travelled in Mr Red Lehmann’s bus, with some stragglers going later in the Secretary, John Dighton’s car.  On Saturday night they were entertained by Berri members with games and refreshments.  On Sunday morning they laid a wreath on the Berri Memorial and then visited the Berri packing sheds and then the Berri Distillery. On the way home they also visited the Barmera Garden of Memory.
