Obituary.  William Satchell died on 10 September [Burra, residence World’s End].  He was a well-known resident of the district who resided here all his life.  He was born 15 June 1861.  In his youth he was a shearer and sheared his first sheep at Ketchowla Station when he was aged 10.  He worked on many cattle and sheep stations and travelled extensively in the northern areas of SA.  He married and went to live with his wife at World’s End, where he remained until his death.  Mrs Satchell predeceased him some years ago.  He was able to build and repair most farm appurtenances.  With his sons he built the Satchell homestead at World’s End, which is unique in having no square corners and many labour saving devices and the roof was constructed to form a semi-circular shape.  He is survived by three sons and three daughters: Mrs B. Symons of Brady Creek, Mrs G. Symons of Robertstown, Mrs E. Spackman of Whyalla, Mr E. Satchell of Burra, Mr Len Satchell of Ardrossan and Mr Horace Satchell of Booborowie.  [William Edward Satchell: birth not found in SA records.]
