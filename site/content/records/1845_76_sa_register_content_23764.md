Editorial: Burra Mine

Comparatively few people realise that the SA Mining Association does not have it origin with the Burra Mine.  It was formed before that body of ore was discovered and its object was simply the general pursuit of mining in the colony.  It had a modest capital and several areas of supposedly promising land were being investigated when the discovery was made that led to such speculative excitement.  The first indications of copper in the neighbourhood were found by a shepherd employed by Mr F.H. Dutton, who in 1845 found some specimens on what was later the Princess Royal property.  Some months later a bullock driver named Thomas Pickett discovered ore near present day Burra.  He was in the employ of William Robinson, then of Gum Creek.  At the time the only way to secure the mine was a by the purchase of 20,000 acres of land as a special survey at the fixed price of £1 per acre.  One half the sum was understood to be forthcoming from a few gentlemen who acted together and who afterwards became the proprietors of the Princess Royal.  Raising the other half proved difficult.  Eventually with the aid of the SA Mining Association it was raised.  When the survey was drawn up it was resolved to divide it into two equal parts by lots; the two groups being called the ‘nobs’ and the ‘snobs’.  Fortune decided in favour of the latter, who selected the northern half.  The SA Mining Association was enlarged to include the new proprietors and the new blood set vigorously to work developing the new mine.  Early returns from surface workings exceeded their most sanguine expectations.  Shares rose enormously in price and their value was soon put beyond doubt by the payment of large dividends.

During the first half-year to 30 April 1846 2,959 tons of ore was raised at a cost of £5-7-7 per ton and sold for £12-1-1 per ton for a profit of £6-13-6 per ton or a total of £19,751-10-2, nearly twice the purchase price of £10,000.  In the next 12 months they made a profit of £62,034-13-0 and this dazzling state of success continued for several years.  The profits for the 12 months to March 1851 being over £115,000.  Then the Victorian gold-fields lured miners away.  The next six months’ profit was £50,000.  The six months to March 1852 yielded less than £37,000 and then the following 12 months less than £12,000.  After that things improved again.  The annual profit at each successive March being:

1854	£25,000	1855	£27,000	1856	£96,000

1857	£43,000	1858	£39,000	1859	£45,000

1860	£30,000	1861	£17,000	1862	£20,000

1863	£24,000	1864	£30,000

1864 was the last year of real prosperity.  The costs of raising ore and the price obtained for it were gradually approaching each other.  In the next six months the mine made a profit of £12,778, but then the following six months produced a loss of £634.  September 1865 saw a profit of £3,520, but this was swept away in the next three years with losses totalling £26,000.  It was by then costing £14-1-3 to £15-8-0 per ton to raise ore that sold for £11-4-4 to £13-5-0 per ton.

After 23 years of operation 220,173 tons of ore have been raised, averaging 22% equal to 49,310 tons of copper.  During the period copper averaged £92 per ton.  Allowing for freight and other losses the actual value to the company is probably about £4,000,000.
