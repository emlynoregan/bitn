Obituary.  Henry Collins of ‘Lucernedale’ Mt Bryan died on 18 October aged 97.  He was born in Devonshire, England and migrated with his parents when aged 7 on the Isabel Watson in 1839.  They spent several years in the south of the colony.  His first occupation was as a shepherd boy near Adelaide and later as a milk boy in the mid-north district.  The family then came to Burra where they resided in the dugouts in the Burra Creek.  He worked in the Burra Mine and when his father went to the Victorian goldfields he was the sole support for his mother.  He got together a bullock team and began carting goods to and from Port Adelaide.  By the time his father returned he had two bullock teams, though he was so small he needed a stool to yoke them.  [Note that by then he must have been over 20 years old.]  Henry then went with a party to the Victorian goldfields, but they were unsuccessful and he returned.  He then married Miss Jane Thomas, daughter of Mr Thomas of ‘Three Trees’.  He contracted to deliver iron stone from Iron Mine to the Burra Mines [presumably to the smelters] and he and his wife lived in a tent at Iron Mine.  With his savings from this he bought two 80-acre sections a mile from where Mt Bryan now is and a little over 70 years ago came to live at ‘Lucernedale’.  Parts of the original homestead survive.  He began with a pine and daub room and added another room when he brought his family there.  He contracted to move the surveyors engaged then in surveying work north of Mt Bryan.  He also had timber carting contracts for the Burra Mines and after that contracted for stone walls on Canowie Station for Dr Browne.  Sixty years ago he began farming.  Farmers were then using single furrow ploughs drawn by eight bullocks.  After eight years wheat prices were so low he turned to sheep and laid the foundations for his stud flock in 1884 by buying rams from John Lewis and Pewsey Vale Estate and age stud ewes from then well-known studs.  The first lucerne was grown on fertile Mt Bryan Flats 53 years ago – believed to be the first large scale attempt north of Adelaide.  He then bought land in the Mt Bryan East district and properties near his homestead.  He briefly held Waurkongaree, part of Chewing’s Estate, before selling it to Sir John Melrose.  One of his sons found a gold-bearing stone at Twigham, but they were unable to trace the reef.  It was not until recently that another attempt was made.  He then leased eastern country and concentrated on breeding sheep.  In 1913 he bought the ram Dandie Dinmont from John Collins & Sons of Collinsville who had got him from James Richmond of Haddin Rig.  His enthusiasm for breeding sheep persisted to the end.  He attended the recent Burra Show and gained several prizes.  He was a foundation member and trustee of the [Mt Bryan] Bible Christian Church built in 1871.  He was known for his hospitality.  Unusually for such an aged parent 12 of his children were at the graveside and the eldest son of Alfred (of Queensland) represented his father.  Of 16 children 13 survive.  Those present at the funeral were: John Collins (Collinsville), Dan Collins (Adelaide), Joseph Collins (Unley), Eddie Collins (Prospect), Maurice Collins (Glenunga), Arthur Collins (Jamestown), Horace Collins (Lucernedale), Mrs J. Rundle (Subiaco WA), Mrs N.W. Martin (Peterborough), Mrs G.J. Hanlin (Willalo), Miss Alice Collins (Lucernedale), Mrs T. Moore (Poochera) and many other relations.
