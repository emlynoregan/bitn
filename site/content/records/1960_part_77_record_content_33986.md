Fires

Three night fires have occurred in a fortnight in Burra.

On Saturday the brigade extinguished a blazing tree, which had been removed from Chapel Street some weeks earlier and dumped further along.

On Thursday night the old wood and iron toilet in the southeast corner of the Memorial Oval burnt down.

Yesterday morning the hedge at the home of Mr Bert Wardle in Mt Pleasant Road needed attention.

[‘Mrs Maggs’ column on page 7 adds that Mr & Mrs Wardle slept right through the excitement at their property.]

None of the fires caused any serious damage.
