Kooringa News, 17 October

The weather continues to be ideal.  Showers alternate with sunshine to promote the growth of pasture and crops.

Kooringa Wesleyan Chapel celebrated its Anniversary Services on Sunday when sermons were preached by Rev. T. Lloyd and Rev. W. Davidson.  Both Monday’s tea meeting and the following public meeting were numerously attended.  Mr MacDermott SM was one of the speakers and he said that he believed the chapel was in debt.  This did not greatly worry him when the debt was incurred by the necessity of enlarging their place of worship.  The debt was £1,000 and Rev. Whittaker appealed for funds to reduce that amount.  Mr Wilkinson reminded them that it was not so long ago that there were no such buildings as that in which they were assembled and the preachers proclaimed the gospel under stately gum trees.  The colony was very young, but there was not a country in the world possessing as many places of worship in proportion to the population; a point with which Rev. Davidson agreed.  He said chapels here were actually built in anticipation of congregations. Recently he had opened one at a place where there were only 60 inhabitants; and what was more, the chapel was not in debt.  He did not agree that the debt did not require attention.  The future generations would have quite enough of their own problems to contend with and he urged them to spare no time in removing the £1,000 debt.  Rev. T. Lloyd also spoke at considerable length on the debt; of how it had been incurred and their prospects of paying it.  He appealed for the assistance of the public in this matter.
