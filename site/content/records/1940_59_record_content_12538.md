A Dearlove Family Reunion was held at Ketchowla on Christmas Day.  Eleven members of the family of the late Mr & Mrs William Dearlove were at the homestead.  Mr Dearlove arrived in SA in February 1854 and went to Ketchowla in 1869 in the employ of the late F. Austin.  He later acquired the property.  The run is one of the oldest pastoral areas and has survived all the vagaries of the seasons.  Dearlove Bros. also own Loch Winnoch Station to the east and Messrs James & Archie Dearlove own Worumba Station near Hawker.  Those present: Mrs C. Davey (Terowie), Mrs Louisa Bayes (Netherby Estate, Mitcham), Miss H. Dearlove, S. Dearlove, David Dearlove (Ketchowla), James Dearlove (Worumba), Miss Elizabeth Dearlove, Arthur Dearlove (Ketchowla), Edith Mrs Roy Bayes (Pandappa), Harry Dearlove (Ketchowla) & Archie S. Dearlove (Ketchowla).

Mrs Davey is over 80 and the Youngest, Mr A.S. Dearlove, is 50.  Cpl Thomas Dearlove was killed in action in France in 1917.  Mr Dearlove Sen. was twice married and the first four above are of the first family.
