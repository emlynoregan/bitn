Inquest/Obituary.  An inquest was held at the Miners’ Arms on 28 July before Mr McDermott SM on the body of Hugh Parker.  Mr Hutson was elected foreman of the jury.

Hugh Parker:

Am father of the deceased boy and a shepherd on Robert Stevens run, Burra Creek.  Saw the boy alive on the morning of 25 July.  Came with him for two miles.  He was in good health.  There was a strong shower and we sat down.  When it was over he went away with his flock.  Did not see him alive again.  He was aged 14.  He was on level country with no trees for shelter.  The weather was very rough and it rained heavily from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.  The night was cloudy.  He usually came home about 6 or 7 o’clock, but was not coming home that night because he was going to Mr Steven’s to take another flock.  Deceased was wearing moleskin trousers, leggings and a kangaroo skin coat.  The leggings were found 100 yards from the body.  The body was about three quarters of a mile from where I left him.  There was no hut or house within three miles.

George Parker:

[Brother of the deceased.  Much of his evidence confirmed his father’s account.]

Discovered deceased lying on his back near two trees, not sufficient to provide shelter.  When found the weather was stormy and raining heavily.

Dr Peel: 
Examined the body.  There were no marks on the body except a simple bruise on the thigh, probably caused when he fell over.  There is nothing to account for the death except the inclemency of the weather.

That was also the conclusion of the jury.
