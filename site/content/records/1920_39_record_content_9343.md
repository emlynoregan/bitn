Mt Bryan Memorial Hall meeting 15 October.

This was called to discuss the Memorial Hall Fund.  I.J. Warnes took the chair.  He said the committee had met recently and found that having had several different secretaries and no proper audit there was discovered on checking that in place of a credit balance a clerical error had resulted in their discovery of a debt of c. £102.  The building had cost £1,317 on which there was a debt of c. £122 and there were outstanding promises (believed to be good) of £20.  Mr Beaglehole explained that the error had been the overlooking of an account.  Matters were left in the hands of the committee to organise ways of working off the debt.
