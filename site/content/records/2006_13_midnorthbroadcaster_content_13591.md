13591→Burra Swimming Pool’s scheduled opening on 3 December is threatened due to a lack of helpers according to Council CEO, John Brak.  The pool needs more supervisors and a canteen manager.  After advertising the Council received only one application for pool supervisor and none for canteen manager.  If there is no canteen manager to collect entrance fees the pool will not open.
