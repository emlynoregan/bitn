Inquest into the death of Abraham Goitt, an Assyrian, began on 28 Feb. and almost at once adjourned till the 5 March.  In 28 Feb. Dr Sangster said the deceased had been brought to the hospital on the 27 Feb. and died on the 28 Feb. apparently from concussion of the brain, which might have been caused by a fall from a train.  He was identified by a cousin, Carlile Goitt.  The deceased had a wife and several children in Damascus.

On the 5 March Charles Bathgate said the deceased was looking out of the window and lost his hat.  He then moved onto the carriage end-platform and when the witness followed shortly afterwards he was gone.  No one else was on the end-platform at the time.  The witness saw him along the track.  They were near Petersburg and the engine and brake-van were sent back and found the deceased.

The guard, William Henry Smith confirmed the above and said by the time he had got the attention of the driver they were in the Petersburg yard.

M-C Alfred Daniel Lambert gave corroborative evidence and the jury found that death was from accidentally falling from a train while it was in motion, causing concussion of the brain.
