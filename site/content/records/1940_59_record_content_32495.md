Burra Rifle Club, Saturday

P.W. Hogan scored 15 bullseyes straight.  In the first shoot of the double 500 yards he got a possible and in the second another 7 bulls straight and a final close inner.  This is one of the best results ever recorded on the range.  It is believed Des Pexton sometime before the war score a 104 of a possible 105 off the rifle and that way back Alf Bevan had a similar score.  The conditions of Saturdayâ€™s shoot were self-handicaps.  If a man gave himself too much handicap and with its aid got over the possible 80 points the amount over 80 was deducted from the possible.  Only A.G. Woodman got it just right and so won the day.  The best four (after handicaps) were A.G. Woodman, J.R. Field, R.C. Melrose & J.E. Harris.
