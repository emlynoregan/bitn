Cricket.  The great cricket match is over. ‘Our boys’ were defeated.  While it was being played we issued periodical extras, giving scores and particulars and judging from the rush for the ‘latest’ our efforts were appreciated.  The Englishmen made 499 in their 1st innings with Australia all out for 100 in a rain spoiled match.
