Bath & Pearce, which some time ago fell into the hands of James & Charles Pearce, has now been sold to Mr Siebery.  The Pearce Brothers leave Burra and will be missed.  Charles was a valued member of the Musical & Dramatic Club and James a clever painter and sketcher with his work widely published.
