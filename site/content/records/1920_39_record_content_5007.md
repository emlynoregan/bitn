Burra RSL AGM last Saturday.

Dr Steele was somewhat disappointed at the laxity of members in paying subscriptions and for billiards.  40% of the subscriptions and the billiards is the sole source of income.  The branch will be in deficit in a year or two if things do not improve.  The secretary has considerable work in obtaining tweeds etc. for which the branch gets no profit.  Running costs require subscriptions from 165 members and last year there were 193 (plus 30 unfinancial).  This year only 131 are financial and 98 unfinancial.

Trix Pearce is now solely in charge of the Furnishing Fund.

In the last year we have added Anzac Tweed, flannel singlets, drill (overall) working suits and men’s & women’s footwear to the Australian Tweed on offer.

The meeting endorsed the decision of the President to support only the names of men who embarked for overseas service to be put on the Honour Roll.

The annual dinner provided by the Soldiers’ Aid Society was held in Pearce’s Building.
