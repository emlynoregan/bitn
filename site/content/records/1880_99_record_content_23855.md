Burra Town Council.  There is not likely to be council elections this year as only one nomination has been received so far for each vacancy.  Unless things change at the last minute [and they didnâ€™t] the results will be:

Mayor	Frederick William Holder

West Ward	William Pearce Sen.

North Ward	Philip Landor Killicoat [replacing W.R. Ridgway]

East Ward	Alexander Harris
