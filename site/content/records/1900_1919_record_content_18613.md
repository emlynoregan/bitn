Obituary.  John Carey of Thames St died at the age of 87.  He was born at North Molton in Devon and came to Australia in 1853.  After working briefly in Adelaide he came to Burra, but then went on to Booborowie where he worked as a carpenter for about 20 years.  He then returned to Burra and started a chaff-cutting business.  Aged eventually caused him to stop work, but he was never laid up with a serious illness.  About three years ago he fractured his leg and although with care he recovered, he had since had to use a crutch and stick to get around.  He used to wear glasses, but late in life lost them and found he could read without.  He leaves a son Frederick with whom he had lived for the last 18 years and two daughters: Mrs A.G. Muller (Broken Hill) and Mrs R. Webber (Mt Bryan East).  There are 22 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.  Mr Careyâ€™s wife died about 20 years ago.

[John Carey born 10 Feb 1820 and died 27 November 1906 aged 86.  His wife died 20 March 1878 aged 51.]
