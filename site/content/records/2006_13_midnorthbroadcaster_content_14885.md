Regional Council of Goyder Mayor Peter Mattey has been found guilty of animal cruelty and will be sentenced in August.  He was charged with ill-treating a Hereford cow that had developed ‘cancer eye’.  RSPCA inspectors visited the Angaston property in 2010, saying the affected cow could be seen from 300 m.  If the charge carries a criminal conviction, Mr Mattey will have to step down from his Mayoral position and a new mayor elected for the Regional Council of Goyder.
