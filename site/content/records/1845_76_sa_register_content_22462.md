Kooringa News, 10 November

The Prince of Wales’ birthday on 9 November was honoured with races at Mt Bryan, about 12 miles from here.  From 9 a.m. till dusk the road between the two places was busy with horsemen and vehicles coming and going.  The scene at the ground was very lively and the races were well contested.  There was a trotting match between McDonald’s ‘Parr’ and Dawson’s ‘Maggie’, which was keenly followed as they were thought to be evenly matched, but ‘Parr’ broke so often that he had no chance.  After the races the principals adjourned for luncheon provided by Mr Dawson at the Mt Bryan Hotel.  [Results are printed.]

Shearing has almost finished and that is good for owners as grass seeds are getting troublesome.
