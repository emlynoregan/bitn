Swimming Club.  Last year at a meeting in the Burra Institute it was decided to form a swimming club, but little was done due to it being near the close of the season.  J. McLaren chaired the AGM last Friday night.  A discussion on the great lack of interest shown in the club saw the club lapse.

[It was last season rather than last year, as the meeting referred to took place on 18 February 1910.]
