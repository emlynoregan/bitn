Burra Burra Mine.  26th Annual Report.

Works designated by Mr Darlington for open cut working are nearly completed, so as to allow orey stuff to be at once removed.  In the last half-year 15,000 tons of stuff has been tipped and this would have been much more, but for an accident to Morphett’s pumping gear requiring a new plunger and drawing lift.  The Mining Association’s tenants continue to renew leases or to purchase their holdings.  Experiments have been made in London on processing the large deposits of orey sand that have accumulated in Burra Creek.  Machinery is being purchased to handle it.  Experiments have also been made on recovering copper from other waste as well by means of dilute sulphuric acid.  Conditions are currently favourable for the company and if the value of copper continues to improve the Directors have little doubt they can soon report satisfactory results.  The profit and loss account shows a nett balance of £17,905-16-5.  The total assets of SAMA are £79,534-7-6.  Cash available for future works exceeds £10,000.
