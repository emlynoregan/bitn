Estimated income and expenditure on operations to the end of 1885 (as far as can be determined)

Income					£460-11-0

Expenditure so far			£318-4-7

Expenditure estimated to 31 Dec.		£506-5-0

Estimated debit balance at 31 Dec.		£45-14-0

Many of these costs will not recur and the Railway Department has asked to be connected and we have agreed to sell them water at 2/- per 1,000 gallons.  The connection is made and the Department will avail itself of the arrangements this week, which will affect the projected Waterworks deficit favourably.
