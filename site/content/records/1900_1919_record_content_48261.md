The Black Springs Hall saga continues with a short letter from ‘Soldier’s Friend’ against the secretary’s stand and another very long letter from W. Howard Turner of Leighton, which is hardly surprising in view of the secretary’s last letter challenging Turner to join him at the front to establish the patriotic credentials of them both.  1¼ columns of print are expended in an effort to clarify the matter.
