Burra Town Council, Monday

There was difficulty in getting a quorum and the meeting lasted only 20 minutes.  We are told the shortest meeting on record was one under S.M. Lane as Mayor that lasted only 8 minutes on a night when there was a good concert in the hall.

Colin Heath of Elder, Smith & Co. has been transferred to Jamestown.  Mr McEwin from Strathalbyn will succeed Mr Heath.
