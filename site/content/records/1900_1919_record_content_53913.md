Kooringa Methodist Sunday School held its picnic at Sod Hut last Monday.  I.J. Warnes lent a motor lorry and trailers and with two hired lorries the group went to Sod Hut, lent by Mrs J.C. Sandland of ‘Koonawarra’.  Rain came towards the end, but town was reached before the travellers got very wet.

Recruiting.  An article of ⅔ column reveals that in seven days to 19 January SA got just 10 recruits from 24 country volunteers and 16 from 41 city volunteers.

Tpr W. Cock has reached WA.
