Smelting has been successfully carried out by Messrs Penny & Owen at their new works near Tothill’s Scrub.  Three bars of all but pure copper have been brought to Adelaide by Mr Penny.  They were produced in a four-hour process.  One was made from black Burra ore, of which the yield is only 18%.  The blue carbonate yields 30%, the red oxide 33% and the malachite 40% according to some recent assays by Messrs Penny & Owen.
