He was born at Saddleworth 69 years ago and his parents later moved to Hamley Bridge, where he joined the SAR Department and was an employee for 22 years, at Wallaroo and Adelaide.  He resigned from the Railways and took a business at Reynella for a short time.  In 1912 he purchased the property at Mt Bryan, where he lived until his death.  He took a keen interest in the Church and Sunday School, being the Superintendent of the Mt Bryan Methodist Sunday School for 26 years.  He was also a church steward and a member of the Rechabite Lodge for over 50 years.  He was a popular figure and active in local affairs, being auditor for the Mt Bryan District Council and Tennis Club and until recently for the Red Cross.  He leaves a widow, three daughters: Mrs F.G. Thomas of Mt Bryan; Mrs E.R. Sexton of Pt Broughton; Miss Joyce Jefferies and one son, Mr F.M. Jefferies of Mt Bryan.  There are ten grandchildren and three brothers.
