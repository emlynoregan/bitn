Wind Farm Approval Changes

Two local councils are concerned that Government changes to the process of approving wind farm developments will dramatically reduce the required level of public consultation.  The Regional Council of Goyder and the Northern Areas Council are urging residents to become informed about the changes and to take the opportunity to make comment.  Goyder CEO, John Brak, said he expected that Council would make a submission to the Department of Planning and Local Government on the matter.  The significance that the Council can place on visual appearance has been greatly reduced.  The changes move wind farms from category 3 developments to category 2.  This requires that only adjoining landowners need to be notified and only adjoining landowners may make written representations to Council.  The presiding member can decide whether to allow a person making a representation to speak in support before the Councilâ€™s Development Assessment Panel and neither the person making the representation nor any member of the public.  Previously any owner of land likely to be affected and any member of the public could make representations.  Anyone submitting a written representation had the right to be heard before the Development Assessment Panel and any person who made a representation had the right to appeal the decision.
