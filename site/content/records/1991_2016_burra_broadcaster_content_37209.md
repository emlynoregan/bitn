BCS has a French exchange student at present.  Nico Delasalle is staying with the Wilson family and loves sport.  Since being here he has tried his hand at Aussie Rules and water skiing.  [A note in the issue for 27 July says he came from Pau –towards the Spanish border – and loved snow skiing and mountaineering.]
