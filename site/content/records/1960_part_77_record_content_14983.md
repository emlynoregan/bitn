Gum Creek School has an enrolment of 37 and there are 4 new Grade I pupils.

[This seems odd in view of the advertisement: 86, 3, 22 Jan. 1963, page 6, but numbered 2

Department of Lands calls for offers for Pt Section 757 Hundred of Hanson: 1 acre: the old Gum Creek School property.  This is certainly the school site.]
