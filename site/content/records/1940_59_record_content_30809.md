Victoria Park.  At a public meeting on 24 March in the CWA Rooms a Victoria Park Improvement Committee was formed.  The meeting was convened by Colin Morrison.  He said the aim was to help, not antagonise the Council and to level and enlarge the oval.  The Mayor congratulated Mr Morrison on the move.  Mr Morrison said the oval was practically level from goal post to goal post and in order to level it from east to west he was sure the carriers would lend trucks to move the soil.  The advice from the SA Cricket Assoc. on laying a cricket pitch and grassing the oval indicated that planting by October would be ready by February.  Stan Woollacott said his measurements showed a fall of 14ft across the playing area.  Mr R.A. Bevan said there had been a plan to level it 15 years before, but Council had stopped it.  He was sure enthusiastic sportsmen would support the scheme.  He moved a committee of ten be formed and Council be given full particulars.  Carried.

Mr Jennison said Council was thinking of a War Memorial he suggested a new oval near the slagheap.

W. Carpenter said he supported Victoria Park as being near the school and the football club also favoured it.

Reg. Davey said when grass was planted there before, the school had watered it, but the hoses disappeared during the holidays.

Colin Morrison suggested the Drill Hall be acquired from the Commonwealth and turned into a dressing shed and the saddling paddock into a swimming pool.
