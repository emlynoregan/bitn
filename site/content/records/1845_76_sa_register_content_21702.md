Burra Burra Mine

Last Thursday all the bargains in the Creek were taken at the usual prices.  Several pitches were let in what is called the lobby or surface workings on the side of the hill.  Ore raised there in the last take is about 170 tons of 23%.  On the whole the Mine is looking more lively and the ‘floors’ on the side of the hill are looking promising.  Some think the Mine will show a profit for the last six months, after paying for sinking Graves’ Engine Shaft, driving crosscuts and executing other sundry works.

This would be better than last year’s report, which showed a £15,000 loss.

The talk is that given a railway line, Burra will again employ her thousand men and if scientifically worked will pay a dividend for generations.  The new engine shaft is now below the 40 fathoms level.  The total ore for the last take is estimated at 650 tons.
