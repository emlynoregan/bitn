A.B. Riggs writes as President of the Institute Committee thanking the Burra Burra DC for their donation of £50 and asking the paper to print a letter sent to the Town Council dated 12 June.

Dear Sirs,

At the June monthly meeting your letter re conference with the District Council and our respective committees was received and discussed.  As your promise re equal representation on the committee of management was contrary to the Institutes Act it was felt that no good could arise from the suggested conference.  If you should still be desirous of taking over the Institute property, as one of the Trustees (but nor by direction of the committee) I would point out that now the committee of management of the Institute id functioning, the legal point which foiled the previous attempt to transfer the property has been removed.  The way for further negotiations on the transfer is open.  The transfer could not legally go through without the signature of the Secretary of the Committee of Management and the recommendation of the Institutes Association.

As there is no agreement between the Institute Committee and the Burra Corporation re the Council chamber, something definite must be done in that matter forthwith, either in the way of a rate, or an increased rental for the Council Chamber, ‘as the Institute Committee cannot be expected to provide a civic home for civic functions, as in the past and under past conditions’.
