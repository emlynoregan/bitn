Accident.  On Saturday afternoon Mr Pickering, an insurance agent, was driving west on Kingston St and had crossed the bridge and was alongside Luke Day’s shop when a car was driven at speed around the Farmers’ Union corner onto his side of the road.  It slammed into his car doing £10 damage and extensive damage to the other vehicle as well.  Had the cars not collided it is likely the turning vehicle would have crashed into the shop inflicting damage and endangering life.  Speeding around this corner is all too frequent and unless something is done a fatal accident is inevitable.
