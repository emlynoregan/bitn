Goyder Council

Burra & Goyder Tourism Industry Development Board was authorised to undertake an assessment of future development of the Paxton Square cottages.

Expenditure in Paxton Square cottages will not commence until Council receives the report of the Tourism Board.

Council approved the re-allocation of $20,000 from Capital Expenditure from the Burra Town Hall ceiling repairs to Burra Town Hall roof repairs.

A request to contribute to Ghost Crime Tours was denied.
