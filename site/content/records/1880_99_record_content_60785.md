Redruth Court.

Packard v. Packard.  This case is reported at length and runs to c. 1½ columns.  It concerns the claim of the widow of the late D.S. Packard against her brother-in-law, Frederick Joseph Packard to recover damages, certain documents and other property.  The dispute arose because when his brother was in failing health F.J. Packard went into partnership with D.S. Packard and apparently, as the partnership continued to the death of D.S. Packard, F.J. had retained documents and furniture etc., which the widow claimed she had a right to.  The verdict was for the plaintiff in the sum of £95, made up of several parts.  The proceedings were stayed for 12 days to allow of appeal.
