Kooringa News, 31 July

Inquest/Obituary. An inquest was held at the Miners’ Arms on Monday 29 July into the death of a miner, John Mitchell.  He was reported to have fallen down in a fit while drinking in Mr Richards’ spirit cellar in Kooringa.  The examining doctor concluded death was due to apoplexy, but public opinion demanded an inquest.  Mr MacDermott presided with Mr John Roberts as foreman of the jury.

Richard Collins: saw deceased 3 to 4 p.m. at Killicoat’s Corner – he then seemed sober.

James Richards: saw deceased briefly in the cellar – deceased then went away, but returned in a few minutes, falling down the cellar steps.  Mr Richards and Thomas Killicoat were present and rendered assistance.  Deceased was able to rise, but not to speak.  When he failed to improve he was taken home in a cart.

Witness said he was not drunk and he did not see him have anything to drink in the cellar.

Dr W.H. Dashwood: was sent for at midnight on Saturday, but was not at home and did not see deceased until 5 a.m. Sunday.  He was then lying on his back unconscious.  He appeared to have had an apoplectic fit.  There were no bruises or signs of violence and he believed the fall to be a consequence of the fit.  Thought him a likely person to suffer apoplexy, having treated him frequently for headaches and bilious attacks.

The jury returned a verdict of ‘Died by the visitation of God.’
