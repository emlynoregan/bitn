The Races at Kimberly Station had to be cancelled due to the wet conditions, but two teenage girls ignored the advice and drove their Gemini sedan on roads unfit for a 4WD and were finally bogged 15 km east of Pine Valley Station.  They were found at 1.30 p.m. the following day.  40 Burra residents who had gone out earlier were stranded at Kimberly until road conditions improved.  Strangely, although the food delivery had been impeded by the road conditions, the alcohol supply seems to have made it through.
