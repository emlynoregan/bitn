Booborowie Pictures will cease from 6 November.  For the past three years they have been conducted by the Institute Committee, who have been selling and collecting tickets.  Fred Dinham, Brian Billing and Alan Dewhirst have been honorary operators.  In this time about Â£100 had been raised for the hall, but now lack of support and falling attendances have made it a losing proposition.
