P.A. Roach writes concerning the Burra Flour Mill.

My grandfather had a mill at Penwortham which burnt down and in the 1870s he erected a mill at Burra.  It was of stone and four storeys high.  In the 188os it was converted to a steel roller mill and a storey added to the building.  It was the second mill (after Gawler) in SA to be so modernised.  It could produce about 2,000 lb of flour per hour.  In the 1890s some of the machinery was taken by my father for use in another mill and the capacity fell to about 1,200 lb per hour.  In 1916, as I was travelling with a load of flour to the railway station it occurred to me that because of its location the mill wasn’t worth spending money on.  My father agreed and said if an opportunity presented itself I should get out of the business.  This occurred in 1918.  The firm that bought it told a relation of mine they expected to pay the cost in two years from profit.  They worked it for a short time and found it needed modernising and they spent some thousands doing so and I was told they ran it for a while, but for 20 years or so nothing has moved there at all.  I think they came to the same conclusion I did.  When first erected the fuel was wood and the cost of six-foot lengths was 5 or 6 shillings a ton and I can remember having to refuse to take it at 7 shillings a ton.  Working one shift we used 3 tons a day.  Later wood became prohibitive and we used chiefly coal.  Wage rises also hit a small mill like Burra harder than the larger ones.  Originally much of the wheat was grown east of Burra, but as this went out of cultivation it got harder to get farmers to drive their loads past the station where they could have it unloaded in the time it took to drive to the mill.  I don’t believe the Burra Mill could make much under the best management.  The local citizens should congratulate themselves that their offer to buy was not accepted.
