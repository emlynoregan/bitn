C.M. Lewis & Sons’ shop at Hallett closed on 31 July, ending a life which had begun in 1912, when Fred Lewis, the father of the last owner, Mr Alf Lewis, began the Lewis Bakery.  Mr Lewis Sen. was an Englishman who migrated from Malmsbury in Wiltshire in 1910 and after working in Farrell’s Flat, Broken Hill and elsewhere, arrived in Hallett in 1912.  After his marriage in 1913 he and his English wife spent the rest of their lives in the business.  At first the break etc. was sold from the bakehouse, but in the 1920s the old coaching stables, where the northern coaches changed horses in the early days, were demolished and the present substantial shop and attached house was constructed.  Lewis’s delivered bread to the four shops that were then in Mt Bryan and also two or three times a week to Petherton, Canowie, Willalo and North Booborowie.  In the 1920s there were several grocery stores in Hallett, including Harris’s General Store (later W. Phin’s and now part of the Hall’s family residence).  On the site of the present road-house was a saddler’s shop owned by Alex Davy of Terowie and the grocery shop of John Doyle.  Drew & Crewe’s were in the property now held by Seigert Bros.  Mrs McCrae kept a greengrocer’s shop and refreshment rooms on the property of Mr & Mrs Bill Reed.  There was a butcher shop owned by George Trussler, recently deceased, on the site of the present fire station.  South of the crossroads was Statton’s Blacksmith, Welding & Wheelwright’s business, employing seven men.  It closed in the late 1950s.  Near the railway station was another butcher’s owned by the Carpenter family, adjacent to the first Hallett Hotel, demolished in the early 1970s.  In the 1930s Depression Lewis’s delivered ration bread to the gold miners at Ulooloo.  After the death of Mr Fred Lewis his widow and sons Alf and Arthur took over.  As the Hallett township declined and it became increasingly difficult to get relief bakers, the family ceased baking in the mid 1960s and obtained its bread from Burra.  Alf continued to make pasties and cakes until ill health forced him to close his business.  In recent years he has been assisted by his sister Gladys Mrs Bob Slatter and his brother Arthur and his family.
