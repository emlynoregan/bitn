Pygmy Bluetongue Lizard Project

Nature Foundation SA purchased 85 hectares of native grassland on July this year to provide habitat for this endangered species – thought to be extinct as recently as 1992. The area comprised a section of the property known as ‘Wandillah’.  The new property will be known as ‘Teliqua’ from the generic name for the species: Teliqua adelaidensis.  An event this weekend will launch the new location and conservation and management arrangements.  Another ceremony will see the handing over of the title to a BushbankSA property Read Creek Hills (formerly known as Halleluja Hills) to the local conservation group, World’s End Conservation Pty Ltd.  This property is an outstanding remnant of native vegetation of the northern Mt Lofty Ranges landscape.
