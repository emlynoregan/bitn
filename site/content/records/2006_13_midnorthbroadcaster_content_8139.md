Burra Mine

The Burra Mine area has been officially short-listed for national and world heritage listing.  Federal Minister for the Environment, Heritage & the Arts, Peter Garrett, last week announced the Australian Cornish Mining Heritage Site (ACMHS), comprising the Burra & Moonta Mines State Heritage Areas, has been included in the 2009 Finalised Priority Assessment List.  State Environment and Conservation Minister, Jay Weatherill, welcomed the move.  The assessment follows an approach from proponents of the world heritage listing of the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape and the South Australian Heritage Council last October, who processed and prepared the nomination for the ACMHS.  The ACMHS contains two areas declared under the SA Heritage Legislation: the Moonta Mines State Heritage Area declared in 1984 and the Burra State Heritage Area declared in 1994.  Both sites have been managed as heritage places under state planning legislation and have active management regimes established by local branches of the National Trust and their local councils.  The ACMHS was formed by extensive 19th century and early 20th century mining operations and contains five distinctively Cornish engine houses, one of the largest concentrations anywhere outside Cornwall.  The site also features a number of other buildings, some in ruins and others intact.  The two adjacent towns contain further elements of Cornish settlement in house forms and institutions such as Methodist Churches and lodge buildings.  Their rich history already forms an important part of their tourism appeal.  National and International listing would add to that tourism potential.  The department for the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts will now prepare an assessment on the ACMHS for consideration by the Heritage Council.  It is expected to be completed by June 2011.
