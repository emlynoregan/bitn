Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial.  A general meeting on Thursday evening resolved that the inscription on the memorial be: ‘Our Glorious Dead.  The tribute of Burra and District to those brave sons who died for King and Country in the Great War, 1914-1918, expressing the people’s undying gratitude, admiration and respect.’

A general meeting to finalise arrangements will be held on Thursday night.  It was decided to invite Major General Antill and Brigadier General Leane to the ceremony.
