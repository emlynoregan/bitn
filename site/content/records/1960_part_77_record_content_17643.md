Burra & District Swimming Club.  The President’s Annual Report by E. Orchard reveals a very successful season for 1962-63.  Burra retained the Eric Tilbrook Shield.  The annual club carnival in February attracted record entries.  Vacation Swimming Classes were very popular.  With the need to install filtration plant fees were raised and takings for the year reached £485.  There is a credit balance of £500.  Arrangements for a £2,500 loan have been completed through the efforts of the Town Council and a pound for pound subsidy has been arranged with the SA Government Tourist Bureau.  Contractors should start work within two weeks and be finished by the start of the 1963-64 season.  During the year Secretary David Clarkson was transferred to Eudunda and was replaced by Mr Roger Jenkins.
