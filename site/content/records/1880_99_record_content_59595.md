A Ruse.  A tramp wrote a series of notices advising that a lecture on the coming elections would be given opposite the Burra Hotel the other night.  A number attended and did not notice anything sensational as had been announced in the notices, but did observe a vigorous collection being taken up.  The lecture was an immense success from an amusing point of view.
