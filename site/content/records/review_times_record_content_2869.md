Burra Community Library.  BCS Principal Mr Roger Henderson said that plans were well advanced for a new mezzanine floor in the Library to house the local history collection.  It will be an internal steel structure that will not damage the walls of the old school building.  It is expected to cost about $21,000.  Funding is still being sorted out.
