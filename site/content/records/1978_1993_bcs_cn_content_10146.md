Accident.  A rather enigmatic comment says that Nicholas Jones is recovering in Burra Hospital from a serious accident – elsewhere a Thank You note thanks Drs Oswald and Davies and Staff of the St John Ambulance and Burra Hospital ‘and those helpful bystanders at the school…for saving his life initially.’

[This suggests an accident at or near the school, but no further information is printed.]
