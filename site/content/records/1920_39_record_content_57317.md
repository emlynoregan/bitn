H.J. Turner writes concerning hawkers.

He considered those prominent businessmen who formed a deputation to Council protesting against hawkers were selfish.  Hawkers, he felt, had a right to earn a living by selling fish, fruit, or whatever.  The majority of the town’s businessmen also ‘hawk’ their goods by means of motor lorry to other districts where they compete with local stores.  He also disliked the way Mr Harris suggested hawkers were dishonest: ‘are all Burra businessmen strictly honest?’  He considered local businessmen could do more for local employment by employing horses using locally grown fodder and local drivers, rather than resorting to motor vehicles.  They could also pay local providers of produce a fairer price for commodities like eggs.
