The Broken Hill-Burra Barrow Push on the Australia Day long weekend in January 1986 will have a first prize of $10,000.  There are entries from all over Australia.  Likely local entries include the Brother Breathers, Super Mac, the Rat Racers from Booborowie and the Clare Crushers, but so far only the Burra Barrow Birds have formally entered.  Committee Secretary Chris Reed says he has been advised there will be a team from Kerrville, Texas (Burraâ€™s twin town).  If Mr Bob Hawke accepts the invitation to present the prizes he will be the first Prime Minister to visit the town since Billy Hughes in 1924*.  The Burra Breathers won the warm up Clare-Burra push on 13 October and are in good form as likely winners.  They covered the 44.7 km push in 1 hour 53 minutes at an average 23.74 k.p.h.  In the 1983 race the average was 20.03 k.p.h. and for the 1985 race was 21.92 k.p.h.  The Clare-Burra race had $900 worth of prizes.

[*This claim is incorrect.  W. Hughes visited twice as PM, on 28 August 1920 and 29 March 1922.  After that there was a visit by S.M. Bruce in March 1925 when he was PM and from J.B. Chifley when he was PM in 1946.]
