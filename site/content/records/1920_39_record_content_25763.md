Obituary.  Mr A.J. McBride has died in South Africa from influenza.  He, with his young daughter Miss Betty and a niece Miss Louisa Waldeck, left on a world tour at the start of December.  Rev. J.H. Nield was also with the party.  The party headed inland from Durban and influenza struck at Middelburg, Cape Colony, 150 miles north of Port Elizabeth.  At first no anxiety was felt, but quite suddenly pneumonia set in and Mr McBride died of heart failure.

Albert James McBride was the third son of R.J.M. McBride the noted pioneer pastoralist.  He played a considerable role in developing the dry areas for pastoralism.  He bought and redeveloped a number of the older properties, so increasing their carrying capacity by at least fivefold.  His early training began on ‘The Gums’ then owned by R.J.M. McBride.  After marrying he went to the city for a while, but soon returned and started again.  He bought Faraway Hill, then Teetulpa, Braemar and then in the north, Thurlga, Yardea, Wilgena, Wooltana and others.  Today A.J. & P.A. McBride control some 5,000 to 6,000 square miles of sheep country.  He was born in Kooringa and educated at Prince Alfred College.  He gained business experience working for Elder, Smith & Co.  For many years he resided in Burra and did a deal of public work.  For years he was a member of the Hospital Board and on the Town Council [December 1914-November 1919] and on many committees.  In the war years he was a generous donor to patriotic efforts.  He was a quiet benefactor to many more than was widely known.  He was a skilled horseman, both at riding and driving.  In later years he also kept race horses.  He was one of the first men in Burra to get a motor car.  He was as great a philanthropist as his father, though few of his generosities were made public.  Mrs McBride was a wonderful helper in all his pursuits.  Mrs McBride is the third daughter of the late Mr & Mrs Philip Lane.  The children are:

Mr Philip McBride of Glenunga

Mrs A. Waugh of Fullarton

Mrs W.H. Swift of Wooltana

Mrs E.C. Collins of Mt Bryan

Mrs C. Taylor of Wilgena

Mr Jim McBride of Wilgena

Miss Betty McBride of Fullarton

There are several grandchildren.

The party was hoping to catch the Ceremic at Cape Town yesterday to return to Australia.  The remains were to come home, but this proving impracticable they were interred at Middelburg Cape Colony.

[Born Albert James McBride 4 July 1868 at Burra Creek: died 4 February 1928 at Middelburg South Africa.]
