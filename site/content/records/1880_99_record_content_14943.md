Burra Flower Show, in the Institute on 29 October.

The show was probably a good success, but the prose takes a lot of wading through to establish that.  It seems the impression was somewhat marred by the defective arrangement of the blooms.

The financial results were c. £35-£36 which was down about £6 on the previous year.
