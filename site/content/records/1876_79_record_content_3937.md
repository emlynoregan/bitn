Burra Burra Mines. 33 annual report of SAMA.

The ore on hand at 28 Sep. was sold to the E & A Copper Co. at a slightly better price than expected. In November the sale of surplus stores, horses, carts, etc. realised satisfactory prices. With the permission of the shareholders some sales of property have occurred; some 900 acres at £5-9-2 per acre on average and the Karkulto sections were sold at £412 over the estimated value.

The water in the mine is now within 16'6" of Morphett's 20 fathom plat and all is secure.

Most of the Association's buildings in Kooringa are occupied.

For the six months to end Sep. about £6,000 was spent on new deep work. General costs amounted to £19,423-12-6 and the value of ore raised for the period was £9,734-8-6. The cost of shutting down the mine was £2,855-1&2. Rents for the year brought in £3,687-1-8.

There was at the end an overall credit balance of £11,780-18-11.

Sara & Dunstan have extended their premises by erecting a steam sawmill and installing a steam planing machine at a cost of £1, 000. The stack is 40' high. The saw bench of cast iron was manufactured by James Martin of Gawler and the 12 horsepower horizontal engine features an 8'9" flywheel. I much more detail is given]
