Band President Mr E.F. Marston stood in for the Mayor in welcoming the band.  His Worship, as the direct representative of HM King George V, whose death had caused such profound grief, was unable to take a prominent part in the proceedings.  Two minutes’ silence was observed in memory of the late king, followed by the National Anthem, to close the proceedings on a solemn note.  The band was then entertained at Mrs Rowe’s café and left on Monday to fulfil an engagement at Cadell.
