Burra Swimming Pool.  The Past & Present Footballers match on Saturday attracted a large crowd and the gate takings amounted to £66-17-8, while tea proceeds increased this to £97.  The Port Pirie Pipe Band was an added attraction.  In the morning the band marched from near Queen Street to the RSL Hall, where a demonstration of figure marching was given before they returned to Queen St.  At 1.30 p.m. they led a procession of cars to the oval.  At the match Present Players 10.17 defeated Past Players 5.0.  The band played at half time.  In the Footballers’ Sheffield Run at three quarter time, A. Tiver of Hallett dead heated with R. Bourman.

The donation list now stands at £457-3-9.

The Swimming Pool Committee has arranged for Burra to be visited by Professor Lorin Harris of the State University Utah USA.  He is visiting Australia as a Professor of Animal Husbandry to look at Australian practices.  He will be accompanied by Mr John Lee, Principal Research Officer SA Branch of CSIRO and Mr D. Dewey, also of the CSIRO.  Messrs Lee & Dewey were mainly responsible for research into sheep deficiencies in the South East and for the use of trace elements.  Lectures of interest to farmers and graziers will be arranged.
