Burra Show Society Special Meeting re The New Oval.

There was great contention on the aim of the syndicate that bought the land from the estate of the late Joe Ford.  But the meeting on Friday made it clear that they are not out to make money, but rather the town should be thankful for the provision of a fine sports and showground.  There was a large attendance at the meeting and there was an almost unanimous vote of Show Society subscribers favouring the proposal to move the show to the new oval.

Mr E. Bowman presided and Mr Thomas Sandland moved the proposal 2nd by Mr Winnall.

Mr Sandland said the trust intended to erect a grandstand to seat 300 and if necessary it could be extended.  A refreshment room would be included beneath it and a large shed for the display of produce.  The trust would grant the society free use of the ground for five years if the society agreed to move the sheep pens, cattle yards and a small shed, from Victoria Park to the new ground.  The cost was estimated at £27.  Mr Sandland said after five years the rent would be £3-3-0, the same as at present.  Subsequent improvements would be at the trust’s expense.  One problem would be collecting admission fees at a site presently unfenced, but Mr Sandland said it didn’t seem a major problem for the races.  Extensive tree planting was planned.  Mr Sandland said the grounds would be ready for the next show.

The trust includes Hon. John Lewis MLC, L.W. & A.G. Gebhardt, Thomas Sandland, James Gallagher & W.P. Barker.
