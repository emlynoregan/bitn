Editorial: Settling People on the Land.

There is a suggestion that the Government should buy Analby [sic] Estate of 65,000 acres to cut it up into 500 and 250 acre blocks.  It was offered to the Government for £2 an acre – what it cost 30 years ago without improvements.

[Presumably this is a reference to Anlaby – a portion of which was eventually bought for this purpose in 1905.  It began with a section 16 km NNE of Kapunda.]
