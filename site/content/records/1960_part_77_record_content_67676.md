Burra Burra DC will destroy weeds on properties from 31 August unless landowners/occupiers have done so.  Costs will be recovered.

The estate of the late J.R. Barker leaves the interest on $8,000 investment for the maintenance of Barker family graves and general maintenance of the Burra Cemetery.

The Education Department was granted the use of the swimming pool for learn to swim classes from 7-18 January next year.

A two-year plan was introduced to clean up the old ballast quarry area including the destruction of weeds and the planting of trees.

Council will place signs at the entrance to the town for tourist promotion.

Council will apply for subsidiary grants to maintain roads used by tourists, especially in the Mongolata and Burra Mine areas.

Bins will be placed in parking bays.

Burra Golf Club applies for permission to erect a new clubhouse.

The acting Town Clerk F.T. Acott reports c. $3,000 in outstanding rates.  Moves will be made to recover them.
