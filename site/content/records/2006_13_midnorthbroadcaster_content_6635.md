Copper Range Ltd.  This copper exploration company is currently exploring copper deposits near Burra.  It has moved its head office from Sydney to Adelaide because its focus of activity is in SA.  It is concentrating on targets in the Gawler Craton, with interest especially around Kapunda, Hawker and Peterborough.  While interest is mainly on copper-gold deposits, a recent high grade iron assay is also being investigated.   [Craton = a large stable block of the earthâ€™s crust.]
