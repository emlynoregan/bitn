Pearce’s Building.  John Pearce has a scheme for the building of up-to-date offices next to the Bank of Australasia which will supply a long-felt want.  Designed by Mr Tillett of Adelaide, it will comprise two storeys.  He has also erected an up-to-date workshop on the corner of Thames and Bridge streets.  This two storey building has a ground floor 66’ x 60’ x 10’ and a first floor landing 60’ x 63’ x 19’.  The front door opens into the shop and office with the timber room adjoining.  The workroom is upstairs and is excellently lit and ventilated with 6,000 ft of superficial flooring.
