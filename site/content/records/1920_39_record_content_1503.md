A Series of Disasters.  On Monday 31 May a fire at George Sampson’s dam-sinking camp at Mingary began with a spark from the stove and spread to the brush roofing of the sheds.  Within about 10 minutes the whole camp of five tents and cooking galley were consumed along with their contents including c. £60 worth of rations and personal belongings.  Losses are put at c. £150.  On Thursday evening Mr Sampson’s coat was stolen at an entertainment and on Friday some polony he had purchased gave him ptomaine poisoning and he had to return to Burra for medical advice.

[Worse was to come: see the paper of 14 July 1920.]
