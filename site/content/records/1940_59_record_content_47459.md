The Adelaide-Burra Cycle Race ended sensationally on Saturday when R. Whitehorn came from behind in the last fifty yards in a group of eight riders and won by a wheel.  A dance was held afterwards in the RSL Club Rooms.  R. Richards, who came second, received a cheque from the Mayor, W. Carpenter, as the first country rider to cross the line.
