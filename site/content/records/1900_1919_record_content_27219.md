[This clearly indicates that at some time after ‘The Emporium’ was passed in at auction in February R.D. Pascoe acquired it.  This is confirmed by a report on the same page that Drew & Crewes have taken over the shop of R.D. Pascoe and will make extensive and up-to-date alterations.  Presumably this was the shop on the eastern side of Drew Lane.]
