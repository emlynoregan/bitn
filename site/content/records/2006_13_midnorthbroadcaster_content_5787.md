Leo Robinson: An interesting life.

At 16 Leo moved from Adelaide to Lilydale Station near Broken Hill, but after two years with sheep decided he would like to try his hand at cattle.

In 1952 on a visit to Adelaide, he approached Sir Sidney Kidman’s office and was offered a job on Glengyle Station, north of Birdsville, to be part of a four man team driving 900 head of cattle from Durrie Station near Birdsville to Marree.  The team utilised 30-40 horses to ride and to carry supplies as packhorses.  The five week trip in November and December averaged about 10 miles [16 km] a day.  Each man had a bedroll and each undertook night shifts of 2½ to 3 hours watching the cattle to prevent them from straying.  Artesian water from bores was relied upon en route for all needs.  These bores were thirty miles [48 km] apart, meaning the cattle would go two days without water and making them hard to handle when they eventually smelt the next supply.  Firewood was very scarce and its lack gave the cook an excuse to feed them on salted meat and damper – yabbies from dams were an occasional treat.  Mulka Store halfway down the track was the only shop and it provided luxuries like tobacco and Kraft cheese.  From Marree the cattle were railed to Adelaide.  Leo undertook many trips down the Birdsville Track in the 1950s.  He also worked on stations when anything up to 30 men would be employed, where now the property is run by only two.  After his first trip Leo returned to Adelaide for Christmas and returned north by hitching a ride with legendary mailman Tom Kruse.  [2 photos.]
