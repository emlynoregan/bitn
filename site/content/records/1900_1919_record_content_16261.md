Editorial.  Hotel Permits

Following considerable discussion over the unreasonableness of the failure of the Mayor to allow extended trading hours for hotels over Christmas the editor prints the relevant section 61 of the Licensed Victualler’s Act No. 191 of 1880.  This says that any two JPs, living within 10 miles of a hotel, can give such a permit, except that if the hotel lies within a corporate town one of them must be the Mayor. [Or a Special Magistrate or a Commissioner, Superintendent or Inspector of Police – none of whom reside within 10 miles of Burra.]  The editor asks whether these criteria are fair.  Another issue turned out to be that of whether the Mayor was a JP by virtue of his office.  Section 62 makes it clear he was not, until properly sworn in.  As Mr Drew had not been sworn in, he could not have given consent in any case.
