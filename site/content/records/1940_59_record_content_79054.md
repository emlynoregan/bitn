Burra Racing Club Ltd.

The AGM was held in the Town Hall 19 September.  President Gerald Gask reported that despite a loss of £150 on the last October meeting they had made an overall profit of £474 for the year.  They were in the best financial position ever and the track and other assets were in first class order.  The club had a credit balance of £850.  The October meeting was held in very wet conditions and the track was extensively damaged.  Forty tons of earth was spread on the track to fill in hoof marks in winter and after rolling, it is in good condition.  The March meeting had to be transferred to Balaklava and resulted in a profit of £593.  Thirty-three of the horse stalls now have sleepers as flooring.  In the last ten years the biggest income has been from the Betting Control Board; rising from £259 in 1947 to £1,787 in 1957.  Gate receipts have been £5,130.  Membership has fallen in the period from £193 to £151 and gate takings have also declined.  A few weeks ago 800 ft of railings were replaced and about 80 posts.  (Thanks are extended to Rex, Jim and Tom Warnes for the posts.)  The new road through Tarlee should increase support from the south.  A drive will be made to increase membership.  As the Show Society made tables and trestles available without charge and the Corporation did not charge for the use of the Council Chamber, it was decided to donate £10-10-0* to the Burra Show Society and the Town Hall Improvement Fund.

[*Acknowledgements confirm that this meant £10-10-0 to each of these bodies.]
