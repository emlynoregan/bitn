Lt T.R. Kenyon of the Australian Instructional Corps has reached retiring age.  Though resident in Adelaide for some years, he is well known in Burra because from 1913 to August 1914 he was Staff Instructor to C Squadron 23rd Light Horse and lived in Kooringa.  On the outbreak of hostilities he enlisted for active service abroad with the 3rd Light Horse and those surviving members who served under him hold him in the highest esteem as an officer and a friend.

Lt T.R. Kenyon of the Australian Instructional Corps has been retired from the 14 September 1935, after 20years with the Imperial Army (14th King’s Hussars) and 22 years in the Australian Instructional Corps.  On his retirement he has been granted the honorary rank of Captain, antedated to 11 April 1917.

Captain Kenyon joined the 14th King’s Hussars in 1893 at Manchester, England, and in 1894 went with the Regiment to Ireland and was stationed at Limerick, Cahir and Fethard (in Co. Tipperary) and later at Newbridge and The Curragh.  In 1898 he attended a 12-month course at the Riding Establishment, Canterbury and was awarded a 1st Class Certificate as a Riding Instructor.  He was then employed as Instructor at the Riding School at Newbridge.

On the outbreak of the South African War Captain Kenyon left with the Regiment for that conflict in December 1899 and from Durban proceeded to the River Tugela and joined Lord Dundonald’s Cavalry Brigade operating around Colenso.  Under Sir Redvers Buller he took part in operations of the ‘Tugela Heights’ and saw action around Colenso, Acton Homes, Potgieter’s Drift and elsewhere.  He was also at the Relief of Ladysmith.  He next went with the Regiment to East London in Cape Colony and marched to Bloemfontein , joining General French’s cavalry.  He took part in actions around Ladybrand and Tabanchu and in the general advance on Kroonstad, Johannesburg and Pretoria and at the battle of Diamond Hill, Belfast, Middelburg and Barberton.

He then accompanied the Regiment to Western Transvaal and saw service around the Biggersberg Mountains, where on his own initiative, while in charge of a group of scouts, he took part in the defence of a large convoy, which had been heavily attacked 10 miles from Krugersdorf; for which he (then a Sgt) was mentioned in despatches.

He was involved in other actions at Standerton, Pert Retief and on the Swaziland Border and finally in Kitchener’s drives around Harrismith and Kroonstad, which ended the war.  He was awarded the King’s Medal with two clasps for his service during the 2½ years war.

After the war Captain Kenyon served with the Regiment at Aldershot and Shorncliffe.  He passed through a musketry course at the School of Musketry, Hythe, and a three months’ course of sword, sabre and foils.  He embarked with the Regiment for India on 6 September 1906 with the rank of Squadron Quartermaster Sergeant.  He served at Bangalore in the south and Mhow in Central India for a total of six years eight months, before being selected for service in the Australian Instructional Staff.  He arrived in Australia in May 1913 and was posted to C Squadron 23rd Light Horse and stationed at Burra.

When the Great War broke out he enlisted for active service on 19 August 1914 and embarked on HMA Troopship Pt Lincoln, arriving at Alexandria 9 December 1914.  He was encamped at Maadi and Heliopolis with the Regiment, forming part of the 1st Light Horse Brigade under General Chauvel until 8 May 1915.  On 9 May 1915 he sailed with the Regiment to Gallipoli, landing at Anzac Cove 11 May 1915.  He was then at Gallipoli until the evacuation and was promoted to 2nd Lieutenant 11 august 1915.  He proceeded to Heliopolis 20 December 1915 and next marched to Western Oasis for action against the Senusi, who had rebelled and were threatening Egypt.  On 18 May 1916 he proceeded with the Regiment across the Suez Canal at Kantara and took part in the Battle of Romani on 4 August 1916, where he was wounded, but remained on duty.  He later took part in the Battles of Magdhaba and Rafa and was promoted to Captain on 11 April 1917.  He took part in the battles around Gaza and was present at the capture of Beersheba and the advance to Jaffa from Jerusalem.  He took part in the capture of Jericho and the operations in the Jordan Valley, the mountains of Moab and around Amman.  He was mentioned in despatches and warded the Order of the Nile, the 1914 Star, British War Medal and Victory Medal.  On 1 May 1919 he was promoted to Temporary Major.

He has also been awarded the Long Service Medal and the Meritorious Service Medal.  He sailed with the Regiment from Kantara in June 1919 for Australia, as Ship’s Paymaster, disembarking at Newcastle and returned to Adelaide and Burra, being discharged 5 September 1919.  He resumed service with the Australian Instructional Corps, being stationed at Mt Barker until February 1921.  He later served with various bodies until retiring 14 September 1935 with the honorary rank of Captain.
