The Burra Cycling Classic was held on 2 august and attracted 33 of the stateâ€™s top riders, including Chris Turtur, brother of Olympic star, Mike Turtur.  The route took riders through Clare, Sevenhill, Watervale, Auburn, Saddleworth, Manoora and back to Burra.  It was the first time the race had started and finished at Burra.  This year the League of SA Wheelmen thought it would be a good idea to return to Burra and spend the night there.  The choice of a 150 km route was also in honour of Jubilee 150.  It was successful and the League now intends to return to Burra next year.  It was a valuable preparation for another major event of the cycling year; the Mt Gambier road race, which will be held next weekend.

The league represents the interests of professional cyclists around the state and is a member of the Union Cyclists International.  Handicap time winner of the race was Malcolm Clasohm of Whyalla in 4 hours 7 minutes 35 seconds and the outright winner was Simon Gabrynowicz in 4 hours 19 minutes.
