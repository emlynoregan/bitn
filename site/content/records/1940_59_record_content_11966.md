Fire broke out on Gum Creek Station last Friday.  The property is owned by Sir Walter Duncan and managed by Mr William J. Kevern.  It is alleged Mr Kevern was burning lucerne on 11 November, but that on 13 November the fire broke out, having been smouldering.  This time the neighbours, thinking it was a continuation of the controlled burn, did not immediately respond and so it got a good hold.  About 6-7 acres of oats and 5 acres of wheat along with 20 tons of pressed lucerne and 25 acres of feed were destroyed.
