Football

The four Mid North Clubs have received a letter from the Secretary of the North Eastern Football League Mr John Ward, inviting them to join the North Eastern League in 1976.  During 1975 the long established Mid North League was reduced to four active clubs when Auburn and Aberdeen withdrew.  The move to amalgamate the two leagues started some years ago.  The Secretary of the Mid North League will shortly advise member clubs to hold meetings so that a firm decision can be made by the end of October to enable adequate time for planning the 1976 season.
