Parklands

A £100 bond was redeemed.  Rates income was £118-4-1 plus £2-19-0 from the oval.

In the year 475 trees were planted: mainly as replacements.

Extensive replanting was done in No. 2 reserve Redruth at the private cost of Councillors, but this largely failed due to frost.

Petty vandalism against trees remains a problem.

The year ends in debit £100-1-5.

Burra Oval: trees are progressing.
