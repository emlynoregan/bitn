The Black Bridge in Kooringa is being re-decked and will probably be out of commission for two months.  The original wooden decking is suffering from dry rot after 55 years service and has become unsafe.  Reinforced concrete decking will replace it.  In the meantime traffic will have to go either via Aberdeen or the Pig & Whistle crossing.
