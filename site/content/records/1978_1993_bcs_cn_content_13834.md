BCS.  Roger Henderson became Principal at the start of 1982, having been Principal at Keller Road Primary.  He has met the challenges here with enthusiasm and success.  His wide experience in many facets of education has seen him sought after as a member of a number of Departmental Committees.  His empathy with and concern for children has been of prime importance.  His concern for all members of staff and others in the wider school community has been no less.  In all his endeavours he has been sustained and encouraged by his wife Margaret and the understanding of Lisa and Travis.  Margaret has been a stalwart member of a number of organisations in the town.  The family has contributed to their church and also to the Pony Club and Hockey Club among other areas of involvement.  Next year Roger will be Principal of Oakbank Area School.  We wish the family well as they prepare to leave.
