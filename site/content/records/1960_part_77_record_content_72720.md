Rx 207 hauled a special steam train to Burra on Saturday.  About 250 steam enthusiasts came for the journey.

Mr B. Gollin started a humble shop in Burra in 1850 and in 1974 Gollin Holdings Ltd is a business with an annual turnover exceeding $134 million.  The Advertiser of 8 December 1874 reported the death of Mr B. Gollin at an early hour on Monday.  [Bezaleel Gollin died 7 December 1874 Adelaide.]  He had been suffering from a complaint requiring great care for some time, but it had not prevented his continued business dealings.  On Sunday he felt unwell and about 11 a.m. he lay down.  When he was seized with great pain a doctor was sent for and he died at 2 a.m. on Monday morning.  He had been in business in a big way for many years in Burra and Adelaide.  He was a successful broker and played a prominent part in the affairs of the Synagogue.  He left a widow and a large family of sons and daughters.  The Australian International Trading Company that started in Adelaide 125 years ago has commissioned the author Osmar White to write its history.

Gollin Holdings traces its origins to the arrival of Bezaliel Gollin in Adelaide in 1848.  He is first recorded as a store owner in Burra in 1850 and when he died in 1874 was said to be a commercial broker in business in a large way.  His sons George and Walter expanded the operations and in partnership with two cousins had branches in NZ, Sydney and Melbourne by 1900.  They were largely involved in importing foodstuffs, textiles and raw materials and in a902 opened a London purchasing centre.  When George Gollin died in 1946 he bequeathed $20,000 to establish the George Gollin Professorship of Economics at Adelaide University.  The early days remain very sketchy and Mr White will visit Burra this week on Thursday.
