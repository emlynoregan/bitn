The Burrows family, old Burraites, visited the town last week.  They comprised the eldest son and three daughters of the late Mr & Mrs Jacob Burrows of the Burra Mine and later of Broken Hill.  Mr Jacob Jnr hails from Kinkabilla near Dalby in Queensland and the daughters were Mrs John Moore of Tranmere Adelaide, (nee Bessie, ‘Queenie’ Burrows); Mrs W.J. Wilson of St Peters (Clara Burrows) and Mrs J. Hodge of Broken Hill (nee Miss J. Burrows).  Master J. Wallach, Mrs Moore’s grandson, also accompanied them.  [Births & marriages registers appear to identify Jacob as being born in Burra in 1860 and ‘Bessie’ seems to have been born as Elizabeth Anne in 1862, but the other two women are not identified from that source where a plethora of Jacobs makes matters difficult.]
