Frank Treloar: Looking Back (Continued)

Mr Finke reported a rich find of copper ore.  Mr Bunce confided in Samuel Stocks Jnr of S. Stocks Jnr & Co. and they then laid the matter before Mr Stephens, Manager of the Bank of SA and Mr Giles, Manager of the SA Company to see if they could get the advantage of a special survey, which the Governor could grant.  A letter was sent to the Surveyor-General on 18 June 1845.  Giles and Stephens wanted to see the site.  Bunce despatched Finke to the spot and the party comprising Stephens, Giles, Johnson, Kingston & Dixon followed later.  On leaving Mr Dutton’s station Captain Bagot and Mr Dutton joined them.  They saw the site and returned to Adelaide, though Bagot & Dutton do not seem to have been so favourably impressed at the time.

A meeting of Stocks, Bunce, Giles, Smith, Paxton, Hallett, Finke and Kingston decided to send Finke for a further examination and on his return Bunce & Stocks again went to the site and on seeing the specimens they had, Captain Bagot & Dutton visited again and this time were convinced of the value.  Another party of Giles, Johnson, Morphett, Grainger, Penny and Anstey visited the discovery.  A person from the north showed Finke a new lode to the southwest of the first.  In all Finke could show several finds within a parallelogram that could be included in the 20,000 acre special survey.  On Giles’ return Mr Stephens expressed the need to secure the special survey urgently.  It was not possible to raise the money without the aid of the SA Company.  It was agreed that the SA Company should have £5,000 as their share.

The problem was to raise £20,000 for the special survey.  At the meeting of all interested parties Captain Allen and his party arrived late and by then there were differences of opinion on the method of working together.  Mr Grainger openly stated he would take no part unless there was an immediate division of the land and owing to that nothing was decided.  Two plans were however presented to obviate all problems: one by Mr Bartley the SA Company solicitor and one by Captain Bagot, and they adjourned.

At the adjourned meeting there were Messrs Giles, Bartley, Graham, Paxton, Penny, Johnson, Stocks & Bunce and Captains Allen & Bagot.  Mr Giles manager of SA Company proposed to take 10,000 acres, removing the difficulty of division with the SA Company getting one half and rest the other half.  He said he had made arrangements with Mr Stephens as to his £10,000 and those wishing to join must immediately lodge the amount for his share by cheque endorsed by Mr Stephens (of the Bank).  Mr Graham produced his cheque, but Captain Allen said the Company’s £10,000 would not be ready till the Dorset arrived from England and the others kept their cheque books in their pockets.  Mr Graham left his cheque, intending to secure his share in any event.

Everything was then considered in abeyance till the arrival of the Dorset.  Late next day however, Mr Graham received a message from Mr Giles and was told by him that two other parties had come forward with £5,000 each and unless Graham and the original proprietors could come up with £10,000 by 10 a.m. the next day (Thursday) he would claim the survey in conjunction with those parties. Though Mr Graham failed to do so, it seems Giles and the two new parties failed to come to a definite arrangement.  Bunce & Penny came forward with £1,000 each to Mr Giles.  Giles said he had to talk to the other parties and met them at the Bank of SA.

Captain Bagot on leaving the Bank met Bunce & Graham and said the original party had one chance: raise £10,000 by noon Saturday.  Bagot and his party would then retire and leave them and the SA Company with the survey.

By noon on Saturday they had raised £9,200.  Giles (Manager of the SA Company), Aston & Bagot proceeded to the Colonial Treasury and tendered two cheques for £10,000 each, but that of the SA Company was not endorsed by the bank and was therefore not held to be legal.  The original proprietors had by then raised the money and offered to merge with Aston & Bagot, but the latter felt they were still pledged to the SA Company and failed to respond.

At a meeting of the directors of SAMA on 19 August 1845 the directors were asked to try to merge with the men who held a moiety of the special survey.  After a meeting with these men the directors reported on 23 August that those men would join the Association on terms:

The proprietors of the Survey should be repaid the amount subscribed by them for the purchase of the survey, viz £8,500 in scrip certificates of the Association at par.

The additional capital of c. £2,000 should be raised by the proprietors of the survey and scrip holders of the Assoc. taking scrip at par in proportion to their respective interest.  Proportion of additional capital taken the proprietors is £1,605 and scrip-holders £120.  Cross subscribed capital would then be £12,320.
