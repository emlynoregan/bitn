Angorichina TB Soldiers’ Car

The utility car donated by the people of Burra and District was due to be handed over to the Tubercular Soldiers’ Association on Saturday 1 October at 4 p.m. in Market Square.  No one had allowed for the boggy nature of the roads and when no car arrived by 5 p.m. people went off home, leaving the Mayoress, Mrs Davey and Mr Frank Harris to greet the advance car with Misses Cleggett & Alexander at 6 p.m.  They said the utility car was still coming.  It arrived at 7 p.m. and it was decided to do the handover on the Institute steps after the pictures.  Mr Crewes explained the object of the meeting and the reasons for the delay and was glad that Burra and District was still prepared to do its bit for the soldiers.  Mrs Collins then asked Miss Cleggett to accept the car.

Dr Steele spoke as a civilian, a soldier and a doctor and Miss Cleggett responded especially thanking Mrs Davey and said the committee had decided to dedicate the car to the memory of the late Signaller W.J. Davey.  Mr E.J. Davey responded on behalf of Mrs W.J. Davey.
