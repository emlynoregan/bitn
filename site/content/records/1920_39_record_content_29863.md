Burra Town Council, 18 February

Mr Fairchild asked if the road going through his property could be closed.  Cr Morgan said that would cut off another ratepayer and moved that the request be not entertained.  Seconded.

The Mayor said there were two roads, one going through and he thought it might be entertained.  Motion carried.

A letter from the Institute Committee advised that the rent on the Council Chamber would rise to £36 p.a.  Cr Woollacott thought the rise unjustified as the room was so seldom used and moved that the Committee be asked to split the difference of £11.  Cr Pearce said he did not think the change excessive.  The Council used the room twice a month for meetings, but the Town Clerk used it three days a week.  Motion lost.

Cr Pearce then moved the terms be accepted.  Carried.

The deeds to the Aberdeen Croquet Club ground were received and the request that there be no Sunday use was granted.

With a tender from A. Nankivell for £100 for the bridge near W. Finch’s the Council decided to do the work itself.  The Overseer’s estimate was £64.

J.E. Pearce was given permission to change the front of E.J. Harris’s shop.

The cemetery well needs to be deepened a couple of feet.  Cr Morgan suggested it be done by ‘jumping’.  He moved that the well be ‘jumped’.  Carried.

[A jumper is a long iron chisel tipped with steel and used by masons or miners to drill holes in rock.]
