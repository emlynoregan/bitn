Goyder Council.  After three periods of public consultation, it has been decided to cut the number of Councillors from 13 to 7 after the next local government elections in 2006.  There were 29 elected members in 1997 and this was reduced to 13 after the first term of the amalgamated Council.  It was decided to keep the current ward structure with four wards.
