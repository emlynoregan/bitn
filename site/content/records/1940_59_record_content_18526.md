State Housing Scheme.  Members of the Housing Trust have visited Burra with details of the scheme.  The Mayor was not impressed with the information available.  He was told that the lowest rental would be 17/6 a week for four rooms and about Â£1 for five rooms.  The representatives visited some Burra housing and considered the homes a disgrace.  With a waiting list in Adelaide for about 10,000 houses, it was not clear how long before any proposed houses would be built in Burra.
