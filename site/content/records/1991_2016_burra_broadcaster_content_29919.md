Burra’s Christmas Pageant & Carols Night came together for one large Christmas celebration at Burra Oval on Sunday afternoon.  In 2002 Father Christmas arrived on a camel.  The pageant was led by the Burra Pony Club members on their horses, carrying a star, which the rest of the procession followed.  Three wise men came on quad bikes and there followed a van wrapped in red and gold, the nativity, a clown, senior citizens and then other floats and groups.  The pageant wound its way around the oval and to the Sports Complex.  It was hot and the air conditioning was appreciated.  The kids loved the sprinklers at one end of the oval.  The prizes for decorated cakes were announced:

2-6 years	Tom Wiech

7-10 years	Sara Spackman

11 years+	Katherine Rowe.

The cake auction raised $614 for the Burra Hospital.

The Christmas Bowl Appeal collected $212.

Carols by Candlelight followed.

The Burra Swimming Club supplied the food and Creeny’s Thai Foodland a number of other stalls were also available.

The Magic Cave was set up on the back of Peter Kelly’s truck and decorated by the Burra Kindergarten.
