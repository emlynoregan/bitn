Accident.  Dr Goode of Brighton was in Burra on Friday for the funeral of his late brother-in-law, John Drew.  His car was parked outside Mrs Drew’s residence and somehow got away.  Miss Fillmore thought it would crash into their home, but a gutter diverted it into Drew Lane, where it took a couple of sheets of iron off Fillmore’s side fence and continued on till it came within 20’ of Commercial St, coming to a stop against the wall of Sara & Co.’s premises.  Badly crushed mudguards were the only damage to the car.
