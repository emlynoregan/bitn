Burra Town Council, 21 May

The Civil Defence Department advised that all lighting restrictions had been lifted except in areas under military control.

Burra Football Club was granted use of Victoria Park for the season, but the Council refused to grade the oval.

W.J. Smith complained of wandering stock and the Council resolved to take action.

Burra RSL Wives’ Red Cross Branch held its AGM on 25 May, but due to poor publicity only nine members attended (there was a total of eighteen members).  The main effort in the past year had been the pie cart and the shop, until the pie cart was disposed of to Red Cross Headquarters in Adelaide to be used to greater advantage.   The total amount raised by the group in 11 months was £70-13-8.

Elected: President, Mrs Hawker; Vice-Presidents, Mrs R.L. Steele & Mrs Roy Lloyd; Treasurer, Mrs Coverdale.  No Secretary was elected at the meeting, but Mrs Steele agreed to act in that capacity temporarily.
