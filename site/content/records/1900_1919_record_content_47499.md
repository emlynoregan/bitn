Burra Town Council.

Senator Foster writes that he is still agitating for later closing time for the mail.

The Railway Dept. has agreed to supply, free of cost, the rubble needed to fill in the road near the station.

The Commissioner of Crown Lands reports that the bridge opposite the Institute has been completed.

Cr McWaters asked about the approaches and was told they were not in the contract and the Council would have to make them.

A. Sugars was granted permission to build in Kangaroo St.

Council voted to erect temporary approaches to the new suspension bridge.

Council informed Mr Winnall it was prepared to grant right of way along the creek to Hon. J. Lewis on the conditions agreed to two years ago for 1/- p.a.

Casual hands were granted a pay rise to 9/- per day as from 3 July.

Council is concerned that the railway quarry bridge is holding water back and causing silting up of the channel.  The bridge was too low and had been narrowed.

[Presumably this means that the width of the opening for the water had been narrowed.]

A conference on the matter was sought with the Railways Dept.
