Boy Scouts.  24 Scouts visited Adelaide for the Royal Visit.  The intended visit to the warships Renown and Australia on Sunday was abandoned due to the crowd at the Adelaide Station and time lost getting tickets.  The troop on Monday marched to Hindley Street where the Scouts appear to have formed lines of honour to welcome the Prince.  On Tuesday they assembled with about 2,300 other scouts at Jubilee Oval for the Princeâ€™s arrival there.  Many scouts managed to visit the Renown on Tuesday afternoon.
