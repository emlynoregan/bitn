The Anglican Choir Camp.  Over thirty young people aged 10-19 attended.  They explored the mine area, hiked to Hampton and presented Benjamin Britten’s Let’s Make an Opera at Redruth Camp Centre on Saturday night.  They contributed the music at St Mary’s on Sunday morning.  (ETSA’s maintenance blackout meant the organ had to be hand pumped till noon.)  James Thacker played the organ and Peter Waterman (16) played the postlude – the Toccata from the 5th Organ Symphony of Widor.  [Photo in the issue of 8 June.]
