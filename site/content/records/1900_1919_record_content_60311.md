Local Board of Health.

Mr Bartholomaeus asked for the letter from the Town Clerk requesting a portion of the hospital be used as an isolation block for influenza cases to be read.

The letter asked for terms and conditions and Cr McBride said it went beyond the terms of the authorising motion and wished to know why.

The Mayor considered the words of the motion ‘steps be taken’ gave sufficient latitude.

Cr Dane supported the Mayor.

The Burra Hospital Board has decided that it would be inadvisable to grant the request.

One case of influenza has been reported.

The Isolation Hospital is without patients, so the cook and orderly have been discharged, but the two nurses have been retained for two or three weeks.  The Matron & VAD are employed by the Central Board.  Matron and Nurse Pearce are currently nursing at private homes.  The place has been made quite comfortable.  The last patient was discharged 22 May.

Mr McBride moved that the Central Board be so advised and that only one case of influenza had since been reported.  Carried.

The Mayor said no arrangements had been made about rent.  Possibly the Scouts would take over the improvements.  Cr Sampson would accept a substitute in lieu of the iron.
