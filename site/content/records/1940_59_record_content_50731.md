Elder, Smith & Co. held an outstanding market on Friday.  It attracted the biggest crowd seen for many years. Buyers came from all over the state.  7,213 sheep were yarded and all were sold for the amazing average figure of £7-18-10 a head.  There were magnificent lines of woolly sheep, mostly wethers, and some excellent lines of shorn breeding ewes and young sheep.  The top price was £12-3-9 a head.
