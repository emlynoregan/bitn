Adelaide Wool Sales.  Hallett producers L.B. Rayner & Sons achieved the highest price in the district at the recent sales.

Accident.  At 8 p.m. Sunday 13 January a Mercedes Benz diesel sedan, driven by J.A. McGuire of Broken Hill, struck a culvert guide post, mounted an embankment and came to rest against a telephone post in the railway reserve near the commencement of the bitumen on the Mt Bryan Road near L.H. Thomas’s property.  The driver was treated for abrasions.

Accident.  On Saturday 12 January a Chevrolet sedan driven by F. Jenkins of Broken Hill got out of control on the Black Springs Road and crashed into a creek, apparently sliding on loose gravel.  The driver and his wife were treated for cuts, but three children were unhurt.

Myxomatosis failed in the Burra area, apparently due to the lack of mosquitoes here.

Kangaroos, emus & wild turkeys are common out east apparently having come from very dry conditions further north.

George Herbert, boot repairer, is giving up work after 68 years due to ill health.  He began working for Walker & Sons of Burra and stayed with them for 58 years.  Shortly before they closed he started up on his own and has conducted a business for ten years.  Mr Herbert took a keen interest in the town, particularly in its sporting activities and was a good rifle shot and later a keen member of the Burra Bowling Club.

Fire Breaks in the district are still most notable by their absence, despite the threat offered by high roadside vegetation.

Burra Hospital Overdraft Appeal has reached £601-11-6.
