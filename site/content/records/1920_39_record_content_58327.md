Burra Bowling & Croquet Club opened their 1935-36 season in a haze of red dust last Saturday.  The delayed championship presentation from last season was held and Mr George Terry received the trophy for Club Champion, with Mr H. Mumme being the runner-up.

Mr E.F. Marston as senior member rolled the first jack and Mr Weston put down the first bowl.

For the Croquet Club, Mrs Clem Pearce, as President, drove the first ball.
