Burra Town Council, last meeting of the old Council 23 May.

The Secretary of Burra Institute writes asking Council to consider the advisability of transferring the Institute property to the Council according to the Institutes Act of 1936.

Cr Lott moved the Council form a committee to go into it.

Cr Samuel believed the Institute had a big debt and the Council had a big enough debt of its own.

Cr Dow supported going into the matter.

Eventually another motion was passed asking the Institute Committee to meet the whole Council.

Licensed Victuallers Assoc. sent a letter concerning dinners prepared by licensees of hotels, but not partaken of by club members.  The information sought will be supplied.

Mr Schoenberg has resigned as Town Ranger.

Information concerning altering ward boundaries.  The Government could consent following a petition under the Councilâ€™s common seal representing a quarter of members of Council or a quarter of the ratepayers.

Council decided against holding an exhibition of paintings from the National Gallery of SA, following a visit by its director Mr Louis McCubbin on the grounds it would be disruptive of other use, would cost money to install wooden rails and would be of limited appeal.

The proprietress of the Commercial Hotel wanted to change the yard of the premises and extend the wall to the creek through the right of way.  Cr Robinson thought it would be an improvement and she intended to put a gate in the right of way.  But it was pointed out that the right of way was actually a road called Harry St/Rd, but perhaps it could be leased.  Mrs Lynch is to be informed and the matter discussed with her.
