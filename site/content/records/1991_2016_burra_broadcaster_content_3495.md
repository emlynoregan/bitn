J150 Update

Last week co-ordinator Leonie Fretwell and John Arthur took the Model T Ford Club on a tour of Burra in readiness for a day-long visit in 1995.

In other J150 news well-known poet Frank McMahon of Canberra and formerly of Burra will be organising a poetry workshop in Burra, probably in March or April 1995.

The Easter Fair was a huge success.

[All the events listed in the advertisement of 30 March are reported to have gone off very well.
