An anonymous Burra Member of the AIF writes from Bougainville as a member of the â€˜forgotten 3rd Division.  Basically the letter complains of the delay in returning them to Australia, blaming the government, assisted by the wharf labourers and coal miners who were causing additional delays above those imposed by shortages of transports.
