Editorial on the approaches to the main roads and the refusal of the Midland Road Board to pay their half of them. When the work was done it was on the assurance from the Board that they would pay half the cost and consequently a bill for between £40 &£50 was sent to them for payment. Their surveyor then declared that although well made, the approaches were not required and were made to private entrances. This was not the case. After their recent visit the Board has decided they will pay half the cost on five of the least costly approaches. The Council will receive a sum of £16 or £17 instead of the £48 claimed. The Board's argument is that their duty is to provide for through and not for local traffic. If this is the case (though it seems rather useless to provide main roads one cannot get on or off) then this should have been made clear when the promise was given. If conditions of numbers or types of approaches is to be imposed and was omitted from their reply then the Council should not have to suffer for their mistakes. Captain Killicoat chose not to try to influence the result in favour of his own locality - in marked contrast to members who argued for the footbridge at Allen's Creek.
