Donna Kelly & Rosemary Seaford have climbed Mt Bryan 60 times.  At the weekend they completed the 60th climb with Rosemary Opperman, who has scaled the peak four times.  They use the track as training for various treks completed over the years, including Mt Kilimanjaro last year.  In October the three ladies intend to go trekking in Nepal with three friends from Adelaide.  This will include a trek to the Gokyo Lakes region and Mount Everest Base Camp.
