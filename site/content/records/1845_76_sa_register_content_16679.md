Kooringa News, 24 June

Today is a red-letter day in Cousin John’s calendar and the holiday was announced with a salvo from logs of wood and hundredweights plugged with blasting powder.  In the evening juveniles lit numerous bonfires.  Though the smell is hardly that of roses, this does have a good sanitary effect of removing a large quantity of filth and rubbish.  Shops were closed.  This year the day included the celebrations opening our new bridge and line of new road, which is almost completed.  About 3 p.m. a procession was headed by Rounsevell’s mail omnibus drawn by five horses and containing the contractor, Mr Haines, and an extempore band of musicians.   Mr Dawson’s mail conveyance with four horses followed, loaded with various citizens and this was followed by several cartloads of people.  The procession started at Drew’s corner and proceeded to Aberdeen and Redruth and on returning came along the new road, crossed the bridge and proceeded to the Burra Hotel before wheeling around and returning to the bridge where it halted.  Mr S. Drew alighted and led his daughter Louisa aged about 8.  She smashed a bottle of wine over the bridge in the orthodox fashion and named the structure ‘The Kooringa Bridge’.  Mr Nicholls, superintendent of the works then declared the bridge and road open for traffic.  Cheers followed and young folk scrambled for coins thrown from the various vehicles.

This road and bridge are a considerable improvement for the town and any deficiencies are not the fault of the contractor, who has fulfilled faithfully every tittle of his agreement.
