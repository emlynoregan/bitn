Volume XV continued from its start on 7 December 1892 and ran for the whole of 1899.

The series began with Volume XV Number 348 on 4 January 1899.

and continued to

Volume XV Number 397 on 20 December 1899.

Numbering was reasonably coherent with only a few irregularities.

Numbers from 348 to 354 repeat a series used in 1896 and for this series the number in round brackets indicates the number of times it was used in Volume XV to the 20 December 1899 and the number in square brackets indicates the times used in an earlier sequence and the year in which this occurred.

348 (3) [2, 1896]

349 (1)

350 (8) [7, 1896]

351 (2) [1, 1896]

352 (3) [2, 1896]

353 (3) [2, 1896]

354 (5) [1, 1895]

The series then begins using numbers not previously used and runs fairly regularly from 355 to 397, although the following irregularities do occur:

355, 384 & 395 are used twice (the second use of 384 sits irregularly between 386 & 388)

356, 363, 376, 377, 378 & 387 are not used.

The jump from 375 to 379 occurred when the ‘6’ destined to make up 376 was placed upside-down to read 379.
