Letter.  Carolyn Wiseman of Ballarat also writes re the galahs – disgusted to see a petition in one of the service stations to get rid of them.  She is also critical of the lack if signage and, in her words, the ‘total lack of community services for the youth of Burra, leading to the vandalism that I even witnessed’.
