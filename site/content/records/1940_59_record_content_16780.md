Burra Town Council, 13 March

Cr Fisher drew attention to the fact that Council owned water meters were being damaged.

The Highways Department was rebuilding the bridge near the corner of Commercial & Kangaroo St.

Cr Bevan thought the Council should rebuild the old footbridge there.  The old footbridge would be much lower than the new bridge for traffic and a new bridge would overcome problems of water lying in pools at its entrance as it does now after rain.

Cr Carpenter was not in favour, as it would come out of West Ward funds.

It was pointed out that no special funds were set aside for any one particular ward.

It was resolved the matter be carried over to the next meeting and that the overseer get an estimate of the cost.

It was resolved there be a special meeting of Council to consider the Councilâ€™s purchase of the Institute.
