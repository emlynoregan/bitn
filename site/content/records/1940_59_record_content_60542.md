Burra Hospital and Pensioners. Subsidised hospitals must admit and treat indigent and destitute patients free of charge and it has often been wrongly assumed that this includes old age pensioners.  This is not so.  Recovery of charges from them is at the discretion of the Board and the sum involved can be recovered from the pensioner, their children, or their estate after death.  Other matters affecting hospital costs were discussed at the Annual Conference of SA Hospitals Assoc. on Wednesday last.
