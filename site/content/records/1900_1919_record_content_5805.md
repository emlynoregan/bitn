Burra Slag Extraction Co. decided, after reconsideration, to restart and to continue till the exhaustion of the wood already on the site, which should be 8 to 10 weeks.  Men thoroughly versed in the work were getting through 1,000 tons of slag a week, but before training only about half that.  The editor hopes the directors will again reconsider and continue to the end of the slagheap.
