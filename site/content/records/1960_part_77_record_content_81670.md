Characteristics of the paper in 1976

It was a rather disappointing paper for local coverage.  Some events that are foreshadowed are not reported when they occurred.  There are many general interest items, which, while relevant to local farming or grazing, were not local news.

The District Council reports are mostly useless and frequently indicate that a question was raised, but not what it was or what resulted.  An example would be:

‘Mines Royalty – Dept. of Mines re royalties Burra Mines.’

As in 1975 AGM material is printed, but there is no evidence that the paper itself was doing much in the way of collecting material.
