Soldiers’ Aid Society held its 11th Annual Meeting at the Methodist Memorial Hall Redruth.  Miss Bubb read the report.  Meetings were monthly and membership had dwindled, but the society sent away £15 for Christmas Cheer to sick and wounded soldiers.  Average attendance was 13.  Last year they had not been able in August to give the usual annual dinner to returned soldiers due to a shortage of helpers, which they deeply regretted.  The November Strawberry Fete to aid the Royal Institution for the Blind was a great success with a nett return of £101-3-1, bringing their total raised for this cause to £638-18-8.  This alone would make it a pity if the society disbanded.  Last May they moved from Jubilee Hall to the Redruth Memorial Hall.  In May they had an ‘old linen’ afternoon for the Hospital and in June an American Tea for the same.  The money in hand was £11-18-10.

Rev. Alvey praised the Society’s redirection of its work in recent years towards the blind and the hospital.  Miss Bubb asked to stand down as President but was unanimously elected President and Secretary.  Vice Presidents, Mesdames M.A. Radford, F.M. Pearce Sen. & C. Fuss.  Treasurer, Mrs F.T. Sara.
