Burra Red Cross & FFCF Unit 109 Shop opened on 24 December 1942.  Business was not as brisk as usual and takings were £6-12-0.  New Year’s Day trading was very quiet and the takings of £4 included a donation of 10/- from Mrs R.W. Bruce.

Christmas Eve in Burra saw very light steady rain.  Businesses were busy with country visitors.  Shops closed at 6 p.m. and there were no carol singers.

Christmas Day weather was perfect.  Only four days holiday was allowed, so many visited the city to see relatives, despite the absence of extra trains which made travel crowded.

On Monday 28 December we understand about 50 people were unable to get on the train for the city due to heavy northern traffic.

New Year.  No holiday was allowed for New Year’s Day – possibly for the first time in the town’s history.

Mt Bryan School held its Christmas party on 16 December.  Prizes were distributed.  This year only two sat for their Qualifying Certificate and both passed: Betty Edwards & Betty Clarke.

W.H. Sheppard writes for the Red Cross thanking all those who gave support in 1942.  Appeals were responded to very well and SA had the best per capita response of all the states.
