Edith R. Bubb writes expressing her astonishment at Cr Woollacott’s finding her letter insulting.  She can still find nothing insulting in it and has as much right to a view as the Councillor and hers was not meant as a slur on anyone.

‘I might ask Cr Woollacott why he did not volunteer for war service sixteen years ago and his reasons might not compare equally as reasonably as mine.’

‘It was not lack of courage or desire to assist in nursing the wounded that prevented my going to the front.’

I agree with Crs Kellaway & Morgan that ‘the guns should be there’.
