Inquest into the death of Richard Finch.  Held at the Bon Accord Hotel on Wednesday.

Ephraim George, driver of the train said as it approached the 2nd crossing from Burra he blew the whistle 600 yards before and nearer the crossing saw the man and spring cart and whistled again.  The man took no notice.  The vacuum brake was applied and the train stopped 40-50 yards after the crossing.

George Lewis, fireman, found the deceased on the frame of the engine; he was carried to the brake-van and returned to Burra.

Dr Brummitt attended at the Ladies’ Waiting Room at the station and saw that the injuries gave no hope of survival.  Deceased died about 5.45 p.m.

The fireman and guard confirmed the driver’s evidence.

Francis Harris was coming along the road from the Cross Roads Hotel.  Saw the train leave the station and the cart approach the line and heard the two whistles.  Was about 40 yards away at the time of the collision.  [Arrived at the scene] horse then nearly dead and cart smashed.  Saw deceased carried to the van and then drove into Burra and got the doctor.  Deceased drove steadily and made no attempt to stop.  The train was visible for 500-600 yards - indeed almost from the station.  Verdict was accidental death.
