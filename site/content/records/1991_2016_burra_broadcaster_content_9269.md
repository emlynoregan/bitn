Letter.  John G. Monfries responds in a long letter to Cr John Oates’ recent long letter.

Over the past months we have heard a lot said about the Council and their management of community assets.

Throughout the Council has not asked the broader community for its views – even if it has consulted specific special interest groups.

This is quite apparent after the public meeting in August at the Old Courthouse.

Its response was to call a meeting of people involved in the tourist industry.

They were hardly likely to be critical of a body spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on their industry.

It is this type of approach that has led to the label ‘arrogant’. 

[The writer goes on to condemn the lack of communication between the Council and the community and the lack of any time for questions from the community at Council meetings – or a forum of any sort for views to be expressed.  Costs for Council agendas are $6 and likewise for a copy of minutes.  He believes a Ratepayers’ Association is the only way for the community to be heard – all else having failed.]
