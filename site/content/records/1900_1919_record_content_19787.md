Notice.  Apology.  I, William Jenkin Davey, proprietor of the Burra Record, hereby apologise to James Sampson Pryor, manager of the Burra Mine, for having made and published the libellous statements which have from time to time during the years 1906-07 appeared in my paper reflecting on his honesty and reputation as a mine manager and taxing him with unwarrantable cruelty in thrashing a child of tender years and I further say that such statements were and are untrue in substance and in fact.

Dated April 29 1907.
