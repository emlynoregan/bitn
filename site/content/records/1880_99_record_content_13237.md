‘Mark’ writes that he is astonished to find that having spent some £800 the Council does not own the Recreation Ground - not having any definite understanding with SAMA.  The Football Club did not get exclusive use of the ground and felt that their situation was decidedly unsuitable with respects to needed improvements such as a pavilion etc.  As for charging for admission - in any such matches they would play on the old ground since the Recreation Ground might be withdrawn at any time if anything else was occurring on the same day.  The arrangement arrived at is very unsatisfactory.  Perhaps a public meeting on the use of the ground would help to sort matters out.
