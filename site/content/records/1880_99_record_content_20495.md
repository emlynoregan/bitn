Redruth Court, 2 December.

Police v. A. Schutz and Thomas Cosgrove for fighting in the street.

Stephen Hill, cab-driver, said on 26 November he was on the stand in Kooringa when a man named Tinker Bill told Schutz he wanted to go to Aberdeen in Schutz’s cab.  Schutz waited 5-10 minutes for the man who was just getting into the cab when Cosgrove, a drover, took him to another cab.  Schutz went and asked for his passenger or the fare.  Schutz told him to clear off and gave him a shove.  Schutz asked again and then Cosgrove struck him.  Both then went to Aberdeen in different cabs.

Charles Morgan, a painter of Redruth, was in Schutz’s cab. At Vivian’s Hotel (Opie’s) Cosgrove was waiting with his coat off and said he wanted a fight.  Schutz said he did not as he would lose his licence.  They moved out of Morgan’s sight and by the time he had got out of the cab Cosgrove was on the ground.

Edward Bourk, labourer, gave evidence substantially corroborating this.

Thomas Cosgrove’s evidence also confirmed much of it except for the engagement of Bill the Tinker.

The information against Schutz was then withdrawn and Cosgrove was fined 10/- + 20/- costs.
