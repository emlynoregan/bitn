The 4th Annual National Threatened Species Day saw a focus in SA on the Pygmy Bluetongue Lizard.  Once common through the northern Mt Lofty Ranges and into the Adelaide area, it had been thought extinct until rediscovered in 1992 after an absence of 30 years.  Searchers have now identified a number of sites and they are estimated now to number c. 5,500.  They are found only in temperate native grasslands of SA’s Mid North.  At a public meeting in Burra on 23 September speakers were Sylvia Clark, Project Officer and Dr Mark Hutchinson, Curator of Reptiles at the SA Museum.  They also spoke the following day at BCS.
