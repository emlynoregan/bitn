Burra Institute AGM 18 January.  An unusually large number of 23 were present.  The President F.T. Sara presided.  Last year’s dances held in aid of Institute Funds had cost money: £39 had been paid for music and the gross takings were £37.

The number of books in the library at 31 December 1927 was 6,672.

The juvenile section had been well maintained.

12 free scholarships were given to scholars at the public school.

Over the year the financial position improved by £95-7-11.  Funds held in banks 31 December 1827:

Savings Bank	£134-9-10

National Bank	£4-5-3

Interest and principal on the loan takes £120-0-6 yearly.

Choral and Orchestral Classes were in recess most of the year, but at the end of the year gave a very creditable concert.

In 1927 the beautiful Roll of Honour of Burra & District was placed in the public reading room.

A.J. McBride presented three very valuable paintings.

Elected were President, Guy Tiddy; Vice-President, Mr Bednall; Treasurer, Mr Bryant; Hon. Secretary, Mr E.J. Harris.

The old committee was re-elected.  Mr Alf Walker and Mr M. Collins refused nomination and both objected to the way people were elected to the committee ‘who had been about three days in the town’ or ‘who only arrived about a day before the meeting’.

The Mayor congratulated the committee on banning alcohol at Institute functions.
