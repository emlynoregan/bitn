Witness 10.  Mr Max Morton

Blacksmith

Betting shops were a menace to sports in the town.

He knew of teams which had to go away short because of betting and of one young man who refused to play football because he wanted to bet.

‘Two young Salvation Army lassies’ and the Church of England Minister were ready to offer evidence, but it was not accepted as it would have been merely repetitive.
