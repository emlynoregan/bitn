The Booborowie Pre-Opening Ball drew the largest crowd ever for a Booborowie Ball.  A telegram from Mr W. Benbow said pictures could begin on 27 April if that date suited the Committee.  Mrs Fred Catt, as representative of the previous Booborowie Ladies’ Club, declared the new stage and proscenium open for use.

‘The Booborowie Ladies’ Club was formed following WWII, during which time all funds went to the Comforts Fund.  Prior to the culmination of the Ladies’ Club, which resulted in the formation of the CWA, the club raised money for a specific purpose for the hall.’

[This sentence may require words such as ‘the outbreak of’ after the word ‘following’ unless it was some other organisation that raised the wartime funds and ‘culmination’ appears to mean the ‘winding-up’ of the club.  The origins of the club seem to lie in a volume not yet noted.]

Mrs Drew presented the green velvet curtains on behalf of the CWA, mentioning that they had cost £195.  When opened the curtains revealed the seven-piece Yacka Melodians Orchestra.
