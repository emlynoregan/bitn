At a recent Council meeting it was resolved to lop certain trees in the town.  The Council has been trying for some time to get the gum trees leading to Victoria Park lopped because they were becoming dangerous.  So far no one has been willing to take on the job.  The Council has now called tenders for lopping all gum trees from the intersection of Welsh Place and Paxton Terrace to and including Victoria Park.
