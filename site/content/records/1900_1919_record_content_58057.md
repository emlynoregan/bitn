Fires.  Just after the Broken Hill express on Monday morning fire broke out in Messrs Kellock Bros wheat crop one mile west of Kooringa and about 40 acres were burnt.  A smouldering stook seems to have started another fire that reached the paddock known as Dr Sangster’s [Princess Town] and raced from there towards Kooringa.  This time Messrs Rogers lost 70 tons of hay and the fire reached the quarry near the hospital.

On Saturday the afternoon train is thought to have started two fires at Mt Bryan and another small fire started at Koonoona from a petrol engine.

On Saturday at Leighton fire destroyed 60 acres of crop on Mr Keynes’s property.
