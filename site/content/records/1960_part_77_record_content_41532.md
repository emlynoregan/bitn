Accident.  The driver of a laden semi-trailer parked on the newly graded section of the caravan park last week.  The surface was soft and wet and the vehicle slid sideways, ending with the load resting against a tree and the front of the load wedged in a forked branch.  The District Council grader was needed to pull the vehicle away from the tree with cabled and then to tow the semi from the park.
