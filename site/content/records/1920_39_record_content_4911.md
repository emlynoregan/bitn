Burra Football Assoc. met at Burra Institute 27 July

The meeting was called to consider advice by phone from the Hallett club that they wished to withdraw from the Association.  After a little discussion with the Hallett delegate who said the resolution to withdraw had been passed because Hallett couldn’t get a team together, Mr Willshire moved acceptance of the withdrawal.  The question arose whether an umpire had been engaged for their next match.  Mr Willshire finally moved acceptance of their withdrawal on condition Hallett pay £1-1-0 if the umpire had been notified.  Carried.  The remaining clubs to be awarded 2 points if scheduled to play Hallett, just as they were for Mt Bryan.
