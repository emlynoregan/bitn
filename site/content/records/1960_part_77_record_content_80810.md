BCS.  Contracts have been let for the new school building.  Adelaide contractor L.A.L. Hellebaut has the contract for bricklaying – worth more than $190,000, with some 250,000 bricks to be laid.  The successful tenderer for structural steel for the site was Manuele Engineers Pty Ltd of Adelaide – worth $130,000. Local labour will be employed where possible.  Site preparations costing about $80,000 by the Burra Burra DC are under way.  The project is scheduled for completion for the start of the 1978 school year at a total cost of c. $3 million.

A voluntary Church Seminar Day will be held for Years 7-11 on 27 October.

Progress on the new building is said to be on schedule despite the wet weather.  The large secondary teaching complex is due for completion by 19 June 1977 when staff and students are due to transfer from the old building to the new areas so that work can then begin on transforming the interior of the old building.  The District Council is now working on levelling the area near Paxton Terrace so it can be seeded early next year to be ready for use as a playing area late in 1977.
