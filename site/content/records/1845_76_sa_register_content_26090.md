The Annual Kooringa Masonic Ball was held in Lamb’s Burra Hotel on Thursday.  Schrader’s Band provided good music and there were capital refreshments. The only drawback was the lack of attendance, particularly of ladies.  This was easily accounted for by the presence of measles in nearly every house in the neighbourhood.

The Wool Clip has almost been cleared.  More than two thirds has been forwarded, with over 10,000 bales sent from the Burra Station to Saturday last.  Fewer than 500 bales are left north of Gottlieb’s Wells.
