Obituary.  Mrs A.J. Heinrich (Maria Mathilda) died at her residence at Apoinga on 18 April.  She was born at Saddleworth, a daughter of Ernest Friedrich Wilhelm Heinrich & Henriette Christiana nee Gregurke.  She went with her parents to live at Hoyleton and later at Lindley where her father, brother and two sisters died in a short period.  She then went with her mother to Tanunda for a few years and later with her mother and sister to Freeling until she married Johannes Alwin Heinrich 14 September 1911 and came to live at Apoinga.  Her last sister died in 1913 and she took in her mother and nursed her till she died in 1918.  Mrs Heinrich had good health until a slight seizure about two years ago from which she recovered and only a week before her death she attended the silver wedding of Mr & Mrs B.E. Heinrich.  Last Saturday in the evening she had a stroke and died on Sunday at 9 a.m.  She is survived by her husband and son Reginald.  [Born Maria Mathilde Heinrich 21 November 1867 at Pine Creek and died 18 April Apoinga aged 75 which accords with the birth, but on marriage the age of 34 is given which suggests a birth in 1876 (or 1877).  Reginald is not traceable in SA Births.]
