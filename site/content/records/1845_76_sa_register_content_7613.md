Local Court, Kooringa, 26 November

Mr Milton sought to recover £10 for the loss of a bullock to which he laid claim, which had been taken away by Mr Stephens.  Milton said he had bought the bullock for £2-12-0 at Gawler River on 28 July.  On 20 October Stephens had taken it away from a boy who then had charge of it.  Judgement was for the defendant; their worships having determined that the bullock had been twice sold and the second sale was illegal.

Thompson & Kekwick sought £15 for goods sold and delivered to McCumber.  The case was not defended and judgement was given to for the plaintiff in the full amount.

Captain Richard Goldsworthy sough £15 for 10 head of cattle given into the care of Mr Neale to be grazed on his run.  He had several times sought their return and now three were missing.  Neale admitted receiving the cattle, but without responsibility.  Their Worships decided that as there was no agreement to the contrary, the defendant was responsible for the cattle and gave a verdict for the plaintiff for £10 and costs.
