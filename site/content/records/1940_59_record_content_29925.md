Burra RSL held its AGM on 18 January.  It was the first held in the new club rooms.  It was decided to reinstate the Anzac Sports and to hold them on 19 April.  The club will meet each Friday and hold a general meeting on 3rd Saturday each month.  The club will be open each night to 11 p.m.  The President M.T. Fuller read his report.

The last year has been very successful.  New club rooms were purchased and though not quite free of debt the amount owing is small.  The Salvation Army Band from Adelaide played for the Anzac March and service.  Rev. H. Hobbs delivered the address at the memorial and conducted the evening service in the Kooringa Methodist Church.  Over 60 men formed a guard of honour for Governor Sir Willoughby Norrie in May.

On Victory Day a parade was also held under the leadership of Mr L.H. Thomas, MC.  It was well attended and fallen comrades were remembered, with  a wreath placed on the memorial.

Remembrance Day saw a most impressive service.  Mr J.C. Goodridge supplied amplification and Mr Jennison had given a record of the National Anthem, the Last Post and Reveille.

Membership has reached record levels [though the number is not stated].

Several appeals for button days were held and an RSL Ladies Auxiliary has been formed.

Mr Jennison is the Rehabilitation Officer and Mr Keynes our Pensions Officer.  Both are doing grand jobs.

Two notable departures during the year were Messrs Stan Genders and Jack Harvey, both of them members of the committee.

Mr G.S. Hawker as Country Vice-President has been a wonderful help.

Other members who had done splendid work through the year include Messrs Bence and Coverdale as Secretary and Treasurer respectively and Mr Dobson, who has assisted the Secretary and is presently acting secretary.

Elected: President, E.C. Collins; Vice-Presidents, L.H. Thomas & B.A. Riggs; Secretary, M. Dobson; Treasurer, R.H. Campbell & Pensions Officer, D. Keynes.
