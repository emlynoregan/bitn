Willalo Automatic Exchange.  The new exchange has made every call to Hallett a trunk call, limited to 3 minutes and costing 5d.  The old service used the Hallett Exchange and thus calls to Hallett were local and not limited in time, for half the cost.  The two exchanges are only about seven or eight miles apart.  In the Metropolitan Area local calls from a public phone can reach 20 miles for 2d.
