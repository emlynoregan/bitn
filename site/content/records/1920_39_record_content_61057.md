A Cheer-Up Reunion was held at the Cheer-Up Hut in Adelaide on 23 April.  Many former workers and diggers attended.  Burra Hall was crammed.  Items were presented and there was community singing of the old war days’ songs.  Sir William Sowden, President of the Society, was in the chair.  Lady Sowden attended, as did the Governor and Lady Dugan and the Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress of Adelaide.  Unfortunately the organiser of the society, Mrs A. Seager, was absent as she is now a complete invalid.  But she listened in to the broadcast.  A good many of the Ladies’ Band were present: Mrs J. Heinrich (Ruby McNeil), Mrs P. Herbert (Gladys Lawn), Mrs L.R. Clarke (Amy Harris), Miss Hazel Pressick, Miss Pearl Pressick and Ethel James.  [57, 19, 12 May 1936, page 2 adds Miss Annie Pearce and Miss Myrtle Isaac to the list of Ladies’ Band members.]  Other Burraites present included Mesdames M. Pressick, G. Lawn, F. Symons, Miss Winnie Pressick, Miss Lily James and Miss Marjorie McLaren.  Supper took the form of bottles of soft drinks with straws and boxes of cakes, with cigarettes for the diggers.
