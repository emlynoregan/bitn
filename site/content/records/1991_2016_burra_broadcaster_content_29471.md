A Fire southeast of Booborowie on Sunday 17 November was tackled by seven CFS units and a host of farm vehicles.  The fire apparently started when a header hit a stone.  About 250 acres were burnt, destroying some $23,000 worth of barley and valuable sheep and cattle feed as well as several kilometres of fencing.  It was an unusual fire in that it extended along fingers of flame driven by whirlwinds in the area.
