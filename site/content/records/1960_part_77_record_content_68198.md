Leighton was chosen as the site for a TV commercial for Radio Rentals.

Ten and twenty foot high white polystyrene foam letters were laid out on a grass strip between areas of forest near Mr & Mrs Colin McDonald’s ‘Rock Hill’.  The letters read:

UP TO THREE YEARS SERVICE

AT NO EXTRA CHARGE	RADIO RENTALS	THE SPECIALISTS

Three aircraft were used and the advertisement features an old Tiger Moth, flown by Bob Burnett-Reid.
