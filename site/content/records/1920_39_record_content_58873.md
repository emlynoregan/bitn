Obituary.  Mr Harry Bentley died in Adelaide last week, suddenly after an illness of only ten days, from which a fatal outcome was not expected.  He was the third son of the late Mr & Mrs William Bentley, pioneer residents of Burra.  He was born at Redruth in 1875 and educated at Burra Model school.  He was then indentured to F.W. Holder (later Sir Frederick Holder) who owned the Burra Record office at the time.  When Mr Holder sold the business to Mr P. Murrie, Mr Bentley continued with him and later continued with Mr W.J. Davey.  He then went to Broken Hill where he formed the partnership of Martin & Bentley, printers.  He lived in Broken Hill for over 30 years and about five years ago moved to Adelaide where he worked for Messrs Harman & Jacka, printers.  About twelve months ago he began successfully to conduct a small business at Thebarton.  He leaves a wife and one daughter.  Mr James Bentley of Redruth is a brother and Misses Tot and Alison Bentley of Aberdeen are sisters.  [Henry Robert Bentley born 16 February 1875 Moonta: registered at death as Harold Robert Bentley 4 December 1935 Adelaide, residence Thebarton.]
