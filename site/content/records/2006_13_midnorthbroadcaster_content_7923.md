AGL’s Stage 3 Wind Farm at Hallett has been approved by the Regional Council of Goyder’s Development Assessment Panel despite strong community opposition.  Hallett 3 Wind Farm will comprise 38 turbines.  It will be the fourth AGL wind farm in the area after Hallett 1 at Brown Hill, Hallett 2 at Mt Bryan and the 63 turbines planned for Stage 4 at North Brown Hill.  There was a public meeting on the issue at Hallett Town Hall on Thursday and 71 written submissions were also received.  Of the submissions 23 were in favour and 45 against, with 3 being neutral.  The company QED was asked by Council to prepare an independent planning assessment.  It reported that while the development satisfied many planning provisions it did not warrant favourable consideration by the DAP because of significant visual impact.  Other negative impacts would be the lowering of property values, constantly flashing red lights at night and the construction of new overhead power lines.  Many also gave strong support to the concept.  Landowners involved, Tony & Kathi Sumner and David & Jo Gebhardt, were supporters of the development.  The final decision of the committee was made behind closed doors, a decision questioned by Mayor and Hallett Ward Councillor Peter Mattey, who also reminded the panel that its decision would have to be defended by sitting members of Council.
