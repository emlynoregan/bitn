Basketball Court.  A meeting at the Burra Town Hall on Thursday night considered floodlighting for the basketball court and the Memorial Oval.  It is believed the cost would be about £150-£200.  As most players were juniors it was thought it would be unfair to expect them to raise the funds and therefore the help of outside bodies and persons would be appreciated.  One generous sponsor has offered £150 on loan for 12 months, interest free to enable the work to be completed as soon as possible.   A committee has been established.
