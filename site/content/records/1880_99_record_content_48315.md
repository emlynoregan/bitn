W. Rodda:

I was in the paddock employed to skim the grass from around fences and was about 300 yards from the outbreak of the fire at about 2 p.m.  Believe the fire started when the feet of cattle trod on a match.  Tried to extinguish it and was helped by F. Carey & a boy also assisted.  Mrs Hunt came with some water.  60-80 acres of grass were lost.  Half an hour later a second fire sprung up behind Mr Sandland who was on a horse.  Matches were then found and I am of the opinion this fire started when Mr Sandland’s horse trod on a match.
