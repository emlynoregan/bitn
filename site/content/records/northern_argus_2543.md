Jennison’s will cease trading on 15 May due to us leasing our premises to Elders Pastoral.  Neil Webster & Andrew Nourse of our staff will commence trading on 18 May as Burra Auto Repairs, from our current repair building – entrance off Kangaroo Street.  They will operate an authorised Ford Parts, Service and Warranty outlet, acting as agents for Vanstone Ford of Clare.
