Burra Burra Show Inc. held its AGM 12 March.

A.B. Riggs and W.H. Lloyd were made life members at the General Committee meeting before the AGM.  President Rex C. Warnes reported that the 1956 show was held under ideal conditions on 13 October and a large crowd attended.  The Gala Night was also well patronised.  Mr H.J. Finnis, Director of the Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society, opened the show.

One of the outstanding features was the flower section, so ably convened by Mr R. Fuss and his helpers, and his influence was also seen in the Floral Art Section, where there were 172 entries.  Entries overall were down a little, but the quality was high.  Schools provided an excellent display in the Produce Pavilion.  Industrial Stands were more numerous than ever.  The pavilion for birds was extended on the western side and skylights installed to improve the display.  Mr H.L. Riggs altered the angle of the shelves in the wool display for better presentation and the produce pavilion floor was oiled to reduce dust.  Following the show Mr R. Fuss has given his time and labour to install louvre windows in each end of the Flower Pavilion to increase ventilation and lighting.

The financial position is sound, with an overdraft of Â£113 and expenditure on improvements and repairs far exceeded this.  There are 300 subscribers.

[The financial statement is printed.]

Elections: Patron, Mr John Parker; Vice-Presidents, C.F. Pearce & T.M. Warnes.

The next show will be held on 12 October 1957.

[There is no mention of the election of a President, but the headline on page 1 says Mr B.A. Riggs is the new President.]
