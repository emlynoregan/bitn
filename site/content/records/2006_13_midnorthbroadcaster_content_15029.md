Burra Cemetery.  The Committee [i.e. the CMC] has applied for permission to erect an interpretive structure and signage at the first Kooringa Cemetery.  Council approved the request to recognise people buried there from 1845 to 1850 subject to the CMC providing a copy of the final draft of the wording and layout for the approval of the Goyder Heritage Advisory Committee, prior to commencing construction.
