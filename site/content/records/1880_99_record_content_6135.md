Editorial on The Burra Corporation Loan Scheme.

Issuing bonds now seems possible at 5% with the last bond payable 15 years from issue - saving 2% on the present bank rate of 7%.  This will also avoid losing £600 of Government subsidy on this year’s rates.  The proposed expenditure is generally well received.  As for the £500 for the Recreation Ground, the Ornamental Grounds Bill will allow the Council to charge entrance fees on certain occasions and to charge the sporting associations and so a special rate is unlikely to be needed.
