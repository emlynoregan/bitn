A.A. Davey, Burra Institute Librarian writes:

Despite considerable discussion concerning the takeover of the Institute by the Town Council, after a yearâ€™s talking we as just where we were twelve months ago.  Evidently the best solution is, as happened two years ago, when the Council declared a special 1d rate for the Institute.  This would enable the Institute to carry on until after the war.  Delving further into the matter while the war demands all our attention seems inappropriate.  For the past twelve months essential business has been transacted by the four remaining Trustees and myself.

[Mr Davey then goes on at some length about the problem of memberships in arrears and the costs of maintaining the reading room.]
