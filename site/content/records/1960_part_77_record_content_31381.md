Spalding-Burra-Morgan Road

The Minister of Roads has advised that funding will be available to upgrade this road.

[The editor summarises the announcement by saying that over the next three years:

$60,000 will be available for use by BBDC

$100,000 is available for the Morgan end of the road and $40,000 for the Spalding end.]

[Check these figures; they donâ€™t seem to make much sense.]
