Chantelle Davies writes re the Regional Gathering hosted by Burra members of Sing Australia at the Burra Town Hall last Saturday:

More than 100 Sing Australia members from Peterborough, Port Pirie, Orroroo, Burra, Glenelg, Magill, Kadina and Jamestown attended.  It was a fun day of singing with Colin Slater, the national director of Sing Australia, conducting the songs.  Sing Australia is a network of more than 150 singing groups across Australia who sing for fun without any judgement made of oneâ€™s voice.  [Chantelle goes on with further details of the activities of the organisation.]
