Local Board of Health.

The Chairman reported his actions [as above] to a special meeting on Tuesday at midday and his actions were endorsed.  Nurse Langley was sent to Thamm’s to assist Mrs Thamm and the Thamm house is to be isolated.  There is only one room for 14 cases at the hospital and the Central Board was wired for advice.

The Local Board was disgusted with the reply from Adelaide, which came too late to stop the races and offered no practical advice.
