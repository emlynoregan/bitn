Visit of the Premier Hon. T. Playford

The Premier visited Burra last Friday.  He came as acting Minister of Education to open the recently renovated classrooms at Burra High School.  The rooms were festively decorated and featured lavish flower arrangements and almond and wattle blossom.

Mr Playford was accompanied by W.T. Martin Superintendent of Primary Education, M. A.F. Pearce Secretary to the Premier and A.D. McDonald MP.  They were greeted by Mr W. Richards Headmaster and Mr T.M. Rice Head Teacher of the Primary School.  Though the buildings impressed the visitors the need for improvements to the grounds was apparent.  The playgrounds have been rugged and rough for almost 70 years.  The opening took place in the new assembly room.

Dr Steele representing the High School Council presided.  His remarks were supported by S. Kellaway as Chairman of the Primary School Committee.  Mr Playford’s speech is reported.  He said the improvements had cost about £600.  Mr Martin also spoke and is reported.

Afternoon tea followed and then the visitors went to see the old mine and at 5.30 p.m. went to the RSL Rooms.

At 6.30 a banquet was given by the Mayor for the visitors and about 70 gentlemen attended at the Royal Exchange Hotel.  The toasts and speeches are reported (concluding on page 4.)

(In his speech Cr Jeffrey mentions that in this year the Burra Railway Station had received 11,000 bales of wool and 40,000 bags of wheat.
