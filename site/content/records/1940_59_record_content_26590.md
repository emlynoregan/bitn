Obituary.  The late Mrs Isabella Halls of Burra died last Tuesday [21 May] aged 84.  She was a resident of Burra for about 68 years and was well known for the help she gave to people in an unassuming and quiet manner.  She was born at Kapunda [Anlaby] 12 April 1861, a daughter of the late Mr & Mrs Samuel Nelson who came from the North of Ireland.  Mr Nelson came to act as head stockman for the late Mr Angas, who then owned Anlaby Run.  Her mother came from Co. Westmaid [i.e. West Meath] in Ireland.  Mrs Halls spent her early life at Anlaby, came to Burra about 68 years ago and married Mr T.P. Halls Sen., a well known cab-driver.  Her husband died many years ago and the business was carried on by her sons the late Mr Joe Halls and the late Mr Tommy Halls.  Two daughters survive; Mrs C.J. Pearce of Joslin and Mrs P.W. Lindsay of Croydon.  Mrs C. Davey of Orroroo is a sister.
