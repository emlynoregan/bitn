Kooringa News, 2 May

When Mr MacDermott opened the letters of nomination for election to the House of assembly the first was for J.B. Neales; nominated by John Rogers Warren and seconded by James Burnell.  The second was for the same gentleman and so was unnecessary, but in it he was nominated by Frederick Hannaford, seconded by George Duncan.  In the next letter J.W. Tyler was nominated by Captain Roach and seconded by Alfred Barker.  The last letter nominated S. Stocks, who was proposed by C.H. Webb and seconded by H. Gregg.  Mr Tyler has withdrawn and though his name will be on the ballot, the contest will be between Mr Neales and Mr Stocks.

The boy Morley, who I mentioned in my telegram, as having been shot, continues to progress favourably and it is hoped he will recover.  He has been in the habit of entering his neighbours’ houses and troubling them with his meddling and importunity.  Mrs Bryant, in order to get rid of him, took down a pistol, thinking it to be unloaded and threatened to shoot him.  Unfortunately her husband had loaded it without her knowledge and when it was fired a charge of No. 3 shot was lodged in the poor fellow’s face and hand.  Thirteen grains entered his face, one of which traversed the upper part of his eye socket and severed a branch of an artery in the corner of the eye.  This is the only one giving concern.  Mr Wilkinson is treating him and has hopes of his recovery.
