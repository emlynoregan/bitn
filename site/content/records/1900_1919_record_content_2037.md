Health.

This year there were a few cases of typhoid, but it soon departed.  The new Board of Health Regulations require the town to have a Public Slaughterhouse in which all meat sold in the town is slaughtered and inspected.  A public meeting was called to decide on sanctioning a loan to build a new slaughterhouse or whether the old one, known as O’Leary’s, should be secured.  The latter course was selected.  D. & J. O’Leary consented to surrender their lease and Council is now waiting on SAMA to grant a lease on the slaughterhouse for seven years with the right of renewal for a rental of £27.  The Council is anxious to have this completed.

The Slaughterhouse issue was the most troublesome for the year.  Twelve months ago he had thought the Waterworks a white elephant and that they should be handed over to the Government.  This year’s experience had proved them not to be in such a bad state.  The water supply was adequate, though he would not comment on the quality.  He was not now in favour of handing back the works.  Recently the Government had bought a great deal of water and the payment for this would cover nicely the cost of boiler repairs.

Mr C. Fuss moved the adoption of the report.  Carried.
