Kooringa News, 21 August

The Burke [and Wills] Relief Expedition, under the command of Mr J. McKinlay, arrived at Gum Creek Station yesterday and should have made Booborowie last night.  Due to arrangements being incomplete it remained at Gum Creek all night and the camels etc. started north this morning.  The camels were a great novelty and many went out to see them despite their being ten miles from this place.

This morning Mr Giles Jnr came in from Ketchowla to report the sudden death of a young man at that place.  A trooper has gone out to make enquiries and see whether an inquest is needed.

[James Hobcroft died 20 August 1861 at Cachowla [sic] aged 28.  The paper of 30 August reported that an inquest was deemed unnecessary.]

The German Lutheran Church here is now completed and will shortly be opened as a place of worship.
