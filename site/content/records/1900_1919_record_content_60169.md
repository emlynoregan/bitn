Soldiers & Sailors’ Fathers’ Assoc. held a social last Friday in the Institute.  A fair number attended.  The Cheer-up Ladies’ band played.  The organisation aims to keep the Government up to the mark in fulfilling all the promises made to the troops and they were fighting to see that victims of shell-shock were not relegated to lunatic asylums.
