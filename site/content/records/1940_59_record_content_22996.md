VP Day was celebrated in Hallett with a Thanksgiving Service at the Soldiers’ Monument and then a public gathering at the Hall, which was filled to capacity.  Rev. John Warren gave a splendid address.  The choir led the community in singing and there were also solo items.  On the second day a children’s sport meeting was held and a Victory Social and Dance followed in the evening.  A call was made for the names of service men and women who served in the present war, to be inscribed on the monument.  In the evening the Glee Club rendered items and Mrs Northmore presented another spectacular tableau.  The evening finished early and some residents continued their celebrations at the Mt Bryan Hall.  On Sunday 19 August Rev. Warren conducted a Thanksgiving Service at the Hallett Methodist Church.
