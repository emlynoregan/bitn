Blyth indicated by letter that it would not be a member of the association for 1966.

Farrell Flat & Aberdeen indicated an openness to consider amalgamation.

Robertstown included Julia and Point Pass.

There was a further suggestion that the following amalgamations be undertaken:

Aberdeen & Farrell Flat

Auburn & Sevenhill

Mintaro & Manoora

Riverton & Tarlee

And that Colts teams then match ‘B’ Grade teams.

A decision will be made at the AGM.
