Burra Motel Ltd reports that $15,000 more is needed for the project to begin.  Tenders ranged from $122,000 to $104,000.  Subscriptions will be sought for another week, after which, if sufficient funds are not available, directors will be forced to refund subscriptions.  An earlier canvass of the district suggested ample funds were available, but little of the promised money has been subscribed.
