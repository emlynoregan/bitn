Obituary.  Mrs Fred Eig died suddenly on Thursday afternoon.  She was conversing with friends in front of Messrs Walker and Sonsâ€™ drapery department when her daughter Mrs H. Seaford Sen. came along and joined the group.  Mrs Seaford asked if she felt all right and she replied that she was, but a minute later she fell forward.  Mrs G.B. Morgan (Sister Villis) was nearby and went to assist, as did Mr Walker.  Mrs Eig was carried into the shop and Dr Steven was sent for, but upon arrival he found she had died of heart failure.  The deceased had been a resident since 1920.  She was born in Castlereagh River NSW 8 January 1863 as the eldest daughter of Mr & Mrs David Harrison and married Mr Frederick Eig.  After his death she came to Burra as members of her family were living here or in SA.  Last week she received news that her youngest son Pte Stanley Eig was reported missing and believed to be a POW.  She had also received news that a grandson Pte Fred Eig, son of Mr & Mrs David Eig of Mile End, had been mentioned in despatches for conspicuous bravery.  She leaves a grown-up family of seven surviving children, four of them resident in SA: Mrs H. Seaford of Burra, Mr Dave C. Eig of Mile End, Mrs A. Goodridge of Booborowie and PTE Stan Eig POW, bot who prior to his enlistment was postmaster at Barmera Post Office.  There are twenty grandchildren and eight great grandchildren.  Mr Dave Eig saw service in the Great War and his two sons are in the AIF, as are three other grandsons of the late Mrs Eig.

[Born Emma Harrison 8 January 1863 Castlereagh River, NSW: died 14 May 1942, Burra.]
