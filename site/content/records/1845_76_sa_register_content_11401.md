Henry King, Robert Houghton, Alexander Mayne and William Dreyer were indicted for ravishing Ann Perry on 22 January at the Burra Survey.

Ann Perry aged about 19 said that on Friday 22 January Mayne asked her to go for a walk.  She went with him for about ten or twelve steps from the house in which a pound-keeper resides.  They sat down on the ground and he immediately began to treat her improperly.  Mayne then completed the offence for which he was being tried.  She tried to keep him off, but was not strong enough.  Mayne then ran away and the other prisoners were coming over the hill.  King came up to her and without speaking committed the same offence.  She could not prevent it, but cried out as loudly as she could.  Dreyer and Houghton and a man called Roe were about ten steps off.  The other prisoners then perpetrated the offence with which they were charged.  Roe came up and took hold of her, but she got away and saw a carriage going along the road.  She ran after it screeching and hastened to her home about half a mile distant.  She got home about 10 p.m.  Her bonnet and cape were torn and she got in the back way and lay down without speaking to her mother and sister.  She did not tell her mother until the following Monday and the next morning Dr Mayne examined her.

His Honour asked if there was medical evidence.  The Crown Prosecutor said there was, but if he was allowed to exercise his discretion he would withdraw the case, as he thought it useless to proceed with such evidence as the girl had given them.

Dr Mayne said he had examined the girl on 28 January and found her appearance like that of a married woman who had had children.  He found no evidence of violence and he felt confident she had not been a virgin six days previously.

His Honour asked if, after hearing the medical evidence, they could believe the prosecutrix.  They said they could not.

His Honour said they had taken a most reasonable view of the matter.

The prisoners were liberated.  The prosecutrix was not allowed her expenses.
