Farrell’s Flat Sports Committee sought the use of the grounds for a sports meeting.  A motion granting this for 25% of the profits was moved, but was lost.

The recent sports meeting showed a profit of £53-10-0 and refreshments etc. showed a profit of £22-9-0.  The club after all costs were in was in credit £50-3-10.

It was proposed to move the men’s dressing shed back from the water and add to it to make a boatshed for winter.  Mr Hawkes will obtain timber for a jetty.
