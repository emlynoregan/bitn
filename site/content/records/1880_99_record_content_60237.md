Obituary.  Henry Howard West died at Jamestown last Wednesday [1 July] at 3 p.m. aged 19.  He was the youngest son of Mr William west and the late Frances west, who died about three years ago.  He was born at the Burra Burra Mines on 4 July 1877 and educated at Burra.  He was a bright and intelligent youth of great promise.  He was appointed a junior clerk in the SAR about four years ago and sent to Jamestown.  He was taken ill on 21 June with a severe attack of typhoid fever from which he never recovered.  The funeral in Burra was largely attended.
