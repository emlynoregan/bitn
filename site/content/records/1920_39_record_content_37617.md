Visit of Premier Hill & Chief Secretary Whitford

They were accompanied by local members McHugh, Critchley & George.  Last Friday evening one of the largest political meetings for many years was held in the Institute.  The Mayor presided.

He welcomed the visitors and presented the Premier with a paper-weight in malachite and gold designed and made by F. Spencer of Kooringa.

Mr Hill said that unemployment was the greatest problem, along with necessitous farmers.  He hoped the future was looking a little better.  The price of wool had risen 25% and exports had exceeded imports.  Wheat remained very low – 1/3½ at the siding, which was the lowest on record.  There were 5,000 farmers who would be unable to plant a crop this year without help and that would be a calamity.  He outlined some of the Government’s financial problems and the need for retrenchments – for example in the railways.  The state debt was £57,000,000 and the average interest rate was 5½%.
