Editorial is enthusiastic over the Burra Slag Extraction Co.’s efforts, but condemns the inaction of SAMA.  The Slag Extraction Co. has been active now for some days on a trial basis and will shortly begin in earnest with three shifts working.  The editor commends the enterprise and courage shown by the Slag Extraction Co. and urges a similar show of activity in the mine and a push from the town towards that end.

‘If we were in another part of the world with such a favourable surrounding the mine would be worked, proved and developed to its utmost capacity and instead of our population continually decreasing there would be a striking difference.’

The Slag Extraction Co. has also purchased 500 tons of slag from the old Apoinga Works to be carted to Redruth for treatment.  This was so primitively treated that it should be even richer than the Redruth heap.  The cost of setting up is perhaps over £4,000, but the excellent price of copper now warrants action.
