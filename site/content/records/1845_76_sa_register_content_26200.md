Booborowie.  7 December.  A reply from the Government re the District Council question has been delayed on account of opposition to it.  The latest opponents being the travelling stock road movement.  Their opposition is puzzling because it is well known that there was no grass for them before the District Council movement began.  In the past the squatters ploughed, burnt and fed stock on the reserves, as they saw fir, to save their own grass from fires.  This year there is grass and there have been three or four fires on the reserves.  The worst began soon after the mail coach passed and burnt till 9 or 10 p.m.  Part of Booborowie Run grass was consumed.  The last on the 5th seemed to threaten the sheep station in gusty wind, but was extinguished by hail.  No inquests are held to determine causes.

No portion of the settled areas is as poorly served with mail services as here.  A daily post to Jamestown from Burra would greatly benefit Jamestown, Deep Creek and Belalie Plain.  In the meantime we must all pay a labourer three shillings per annum to fetch letters from Kooringa.

Fencing in the district is making matters worse for settlers as road are being closed.
