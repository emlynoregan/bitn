Burra School’s collection of bones, paper and cardboard has been successful for their Patriotic Fund.  The load of 5¾ tons sent in December included 33½ cwt of bones, over ¾ ton of cardboard and over 2 tons of paper.  They have made over 100 camouflage nets and paid £332-18-10 in War Savings, bringing the total owed to students to £1,135-18-10.  The value of waste products was £328 and money given directly to the SPF was £185.
