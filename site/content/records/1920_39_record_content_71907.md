Burra Town Council, 1 August

M.W. Bednall forwarded a tentative agreement between Institute Trustees and the Council.

The Town Clerk read estimates for income and expenditure which suggested a possible debit of £128 at the end of the current financial year.

This did not include the £400 possibly to be spent on a swimming pool, which showed on the loan account.

Various road matters and trees were dealt with.

There has been no reply yet from the Architect-in-Chief’s Dept. about the swimming pool plans.

A response will now be requested.
