C.A.S. Hawker added his congratulations and spoke of the district’s sacrifice in the Great War and of the depression and its impact on the district.

Councillor Atkins also spoke saying he was pleased to be present.  When the Council had been approached for the land six years before, he had not been in favour of the scheme, but had voted for them to have the ground.  He felt the change from a hall to an Institute was a wise move, as it would encourage education and reading.  Strong drink was ruining dancing at Farrell’s Flat, but he hoped that Hanson would have many happy functions in the new hall.

Mr Jennison spoke for the Burra RSL adding his congratulations.

Mr McDonald MP added his congratulations and hoped that those who came for pleasure would also read the honour roll and realise to some extent why the building was erected.

J.E. Hogan moved a vote of thanks to Hon. Duncan, seconded by Mr Pattullo.

Mr Jennison then unveiled the Roll of Honour and a minute’s silence was observed and the Last Post and Reveille were sounded by Mr Jennison and the National Anthem sung.

The Chairman said that they hadn’t quite completed the inside, but had to get the Hon. Duncan when he was available and for under £50 the committee could complete the work.

Afternoon tea followed.

A successful dance was held in the evening, which taxed the hall to its utmost seating and dancing capacity.  Takings were about £32.  Supper followed in the Council Chamber.
