The Old Swimming Pool Area

Burra Lions Club has presented the Burra Burra DC with a plan to redevelop this site as a picnic and barbecue area, with the work to be done in four stages.  Council has accepted the plan.

Plant a lawn in the pool area, remove the chain wire fence on Market Street and provide ramp access for wheelchairs and pushers.

Open landscaped picnic area on the old buildings site.

Landscape the area between the pool and the motel.

Remove the eastern perimeter fence and landscape down to the Burra Creek.
