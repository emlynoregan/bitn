J.C. Kirby, Hon. Sec. State Retail Liquor League writes a letter to the editor in favour of severely limiting the number of liquor outlets and using profits to compensate current licence holders who would be displaced.  There would be only ‘a reasonable number of good hotels’ (with a very strictly regulated quality of liquor.)
