Burra Burra Hospital Re-development

The Adelaide builder has been placed in liquidation and work has been stopped for a month.

D.T. Jacka & Co. Pty Ltd has been commissioned to complete the project using some sub-contractors and work is expected to be completed by the end of June.  Most of the major demolition and building work has been completed.  Finishing trades are now being employed to complete the project.
