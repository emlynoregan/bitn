Pioneer Coaches have withdrawn their service to Broken Hill via Burra, due to the bad road.  They will now travel via Clare, Jamestown, Yongala and Peterborough.  There are only twenty miles of gravel to Peterborough via that route.  The Burra route was recognised in 1938 as the direct Broken Hill route, but bituminising has been pushed aside ever since.  This detour means a significant loss to Burra traders.  Burra is not the only loser.  This bad road now encourages Broken Hill holiday makers to go to NSW or Victoria.
