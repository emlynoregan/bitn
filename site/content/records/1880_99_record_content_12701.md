Dr Cockburn:

He said he was not a partisan of any one cause and took a broad view of the general interest of the colony.  He was ardently pro-temperance.

On annexation he agreed that no other nation should be allowed to annex islands adjacent to our coasts and New Guinea should be annexed by Great Britain.  France should cease to send criminals to New Hebrides.

On Federation he thought it an assured thing in the long run and those for it should not hold back because the details were not perfect.  He hoped the recent proposal would be passed.

He favoured payment for MPs.

Taxation would have to be raised and he favoured the NZ scheme.
