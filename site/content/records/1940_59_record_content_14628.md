Booborowie Centenary 1843-1943.  [Continued from 63, 31 (2), 10 Aug. 1943, page 3.]

The purchase in 1864-67 seemed to set Booborowie apart as a sheep station permanently and much work went into station buildings, fencing, etc.

In 1875 a township was surveyed on Section 464 in the Hundred of Ayers and named.  A few allotments were sold and the township remained till 1911 when the remainder were sold to the late John Quinn Hogan of Leighton.  In 1875 a movement to survey a site for the town on Section 210 was made (near Ayers Forest Reserve), but for some reason this site was abandoned and in 1876 the present township was surveyed and proclaimed on 29 March 1877 and allotments were offered for sale in 1877.  The average price paid for allotments was c. Â£5-5-0.  No buildings were erected, so presumably speculation was the motive.  By then about 60,000 sheep were being shorn annually.  It appears the property was taken over by W.J. Browne as no mention is made of J.H. Browne in 1894 when W.J. Brown died.  The executors then disposed of the northern portion to Henry Dutton of Anlaby & George Melrose of Ulooloo and in 1897 the Dutton & Melrose section became known as North Booborowie.  In 1910 a portion of Booborowie Station was sold for closer settlement and in 1912 the remainder was also sold for closer settlement.  In 1910 North Booborowie was offered to the Government for closer settlement and the Government purchased the land and the property was subdivided.  Booborowie Station slipped into oblivion.  Steady progress followed with huge quantities of cereals produced and thousands of acres of prolific lucerne in production.

[Warning.  I would not take the above as fact without further checking.  W.J. Browne set out the town of Baldry on Section 454 (not 464) in 1875 and this became the site of the Booborowie Eating House and Booborowie DC Chamber.  It sounds very like the place mentioned above.]
