The Burra-Morgan Car Rally

Last weekend the centenary of the first Burra-Morgan car rally of 1906 was celebrated when more than 30 vehicles took part in the re-enactment.  Entrants registered by 3 p.m. on Saturday 30 September and then joined in a dinner that night at the Burra Hotel.  The cars were flagged off at 7.30 a.m. Sunday and reached Morgan by 11 a.m., where there was lunch, a paddle-wheeler and the 1956 flood exhibition at the museum to view before the return to Burra.
