Obituary.  Mr Benjamin Harris died at Subiaco Perth on 11 September aged 54.  He was the only surviving son of the late Mr & Mrs Ambrose Harris of Kooringa and was born here in 1874.  After leaving school he worked for his brother-in-law J.A. Watt who owned a drapery business on the spot where C. Parkâ€™s shop now stands.  He married Miss Harriett Cheynoweth of Kooringa and they later moved permanently to WA.  Mr & Mrs Harris visited Burra last year and soon after returning he contracted a cold which led to lung problems which ultimately killed him.  He leaves a widow, two married daughters and two sons, the elder of whom is married.  He leaves five sisters: Mesdames J.A. Watt, R.H. Steele (Toorak Gardens), Charles Parks (Kooringa) & J.E. Greenwood (Aldgate).
