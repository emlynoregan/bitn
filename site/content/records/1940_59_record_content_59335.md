Methodist Youth March

On Sunday 24 May about 60 young people marched from the Kooringa Church to the Burra Town Hall as part of Wesley Day Celebrations commemorating the conversion of John Wesley.  After reaching the Town Hall the Kindergarten Group returned to the Sunday School where a session was conducted by Mrs Baulderstone and Miss Joan Fairchild.  The others and adults had a service in the Town Hall conducted by Rev. C. Christopher with Pastor Ashdown leading the prayers.  Guest speaker for the afternoon was R.M. Le Maistre, head teacher at Eudunda High School.  The Brighton Babies Home was sent Â£3-15-5 from the offertory.
