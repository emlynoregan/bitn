Anzac Service.  The 22nd anniversary service for the Gallipoli landing was held on Sunday 2 May.  The local service was delayed as so many of the returned men went to Adelaide for the 25th April.  The returned men marched four abreast from the RSL rooms to the hospital and thence to the Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial led by the Waikerie Band who had come with J.H. Murison for the occasion.  This year there were no returned nurses with Mrs D. Keynes being absent in the city.  Members of the 9/23 Light Horse followed the diggers.  Rev. A. Dyer (Methodist) led the service while Rev. D.L. Redding (Anglican) gave the address and Capt. Williams of the Salvation Army assisted.
