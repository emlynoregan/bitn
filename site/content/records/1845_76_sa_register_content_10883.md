Main Lines of Road

The Surveyor-General Captain A.H. Freeling reports to parliament on SA’s main lines of road.

He lists 26 main roads extending for c. 668 miles.

At the close of 1856 about 118 miles of main road had been formed and metalled, leaving some 550 miles unmade.

Costs of metalling are c. £1,900 per mile.

[Given the huge cost of making the roads and then maintaining them at a cost of some £150 p.a. per mile, Captain Freeling sought to reduce expenditure by reducing the mileage of main roads.  He removed for the list all roads running parallel to railways and also those near the coast where coastal transport might suffice (as for instance south of Noarlunga because jetties had been erected along the coast).  He argued that the Adelaide-Gawler railway also allowed the Burra-Port Wakefield road to be removed from the list of main roads.  The construction of the railway to Kapunda, he thought should see the main road to Clare repositioned to run from Kapunda to Clare.  A whole lot of other argument follows on other main roads.  His new length of main roads is thus reduced to c. 470 miles, of which some 74 miles are made and metalled.]
