Mt Bryan School will hold its annual picnic on 25 March, when they will go to Fisherman’s Bay.

The Annual St Patrick’s Day Dance was successfully held in the Burra Town Hall on Friday last.

Robertstown DC is repairing its section of the Burra-Morgan Road.

The Lord Mayor’s NSW Floods Relief Fund has reached £86-2-6.

Mt Bryan School.  The school oval was opened recently by Mr A.L. Collins in the unavoidable absence of Mr Lew Gare.  The land had been donated by Mr Lew Gare and the cricket pitch and a cricket set was donated by Mr Collins.  Busy bees erected the gates, fencing and posts.  Mr W. Muller, the Head Teacher, thanked Mr Collins and Mr Gare for their generosity.  Mr Bryan and Booborowie Schools played a game of cricket in the afternoon.

Cricket.  At the weekend, at a cricket match being played at Mt Bryan, Peter Drew of Leighton was running late so he flew from Leighton and landed in the paddock adjoining the ground.

Booborowie 137 & 3 for 209 defeated Leighton 78.  [Scores p.3.]
