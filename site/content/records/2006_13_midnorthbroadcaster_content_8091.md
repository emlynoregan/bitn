Collinsville Stud has been named Elders Supreme Clip of the year Award Winner at a presentation ceremony in Burra.  The Elders Awards were established 19 years ago.  Elders portfolio wool manager, Craig Eckert, said the stateâ€™s wool producers have set an exceptional standard in the preparation of their wool clips over the years, with the Collinsville group continuing a strong tradition.  The Collinsville Station clip, JC in a triangle/ Collinsville, sold in M45A, was exceptionally well prepared and presented to the market place.  It was classed by Dee Irwin.  Collinsville general manager, Peter Whittlesea, said the award was a deserved honour for the people involved in the stud over the past five years.  To be classed number one out of 3,000 across the state was a bonus.  Several other local producers had been monthly clip of the sale winners, including J. & F. Sullivan & Co. from Greenfields Merino Stud, Hallett and P. & P. Verco from Quondong Station.  [Photo]
