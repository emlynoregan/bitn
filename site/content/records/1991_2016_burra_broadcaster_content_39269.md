Rural Clinical Education

A special community meeting on Monday evening explored the possibility of a new Flinders University Rural Clinical Education Centre for Burra.  The Parallel Rural Community Curriculum (PRCC) Program offers rural placement for third year medical students, immersing them in rural general practice and rural community life.  Students work closely with the local GPs, nursing staff and allied health professionals.  Working in smaller hospitals develops a greater sense of responsibility and generally gives students more time with patient follow-up and with visiting specialists and consultants.  The program also aims to get more Australian trained doctors into rural and regional areas.  [Photo.]
