David Maher, as artist in residence, has written ‘Designing the Future’ for Burra students to tour.  It has already had two very positive workshops at Booborowie and Mt Bryan Primary Schools and will appear at Hallett, Spalding and BCS.  [Details are given.]

In the play a half-human, half-robot creation rules the planet in the twenty-first century and her factories and pollution are causing acid rain that destroys anything exposed to it.
