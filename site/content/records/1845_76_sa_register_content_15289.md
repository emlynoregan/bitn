Kooringa News, 31 December 1861

Christmas brought perfect weather this year for family gatherings, musical parties, picnics or excursion trips.

On Wednesday nearly all places of worship had special services and on the next day the Primitive Methodist Sunday School held its anniversary.  In the afternoon the pupils and teachers walked in procession through the town before partaking of tea and cake in the chapel.  Parents and an immense number of visitors had tea after them before the public meeting.

On Thursday The Local Court sat for Full Jurisdiction at Redruth to hear several interesting cases that saw the court house unusually crowded.

Tobias Pierce was charged with threatening to stab Corporal Mallon while in performance of his duty.  The Corporal had been sent to remove Pierce after a disturbance at a house and he resisted the police and committed the offence for which he was sentenced to three months imprisonment in the Redruth Gaol.

In the case of those accused in connection with the nuisance at the recent tinkettling, both sides employed counsel, but the Bench failed to be impressed by the arguments for the defence and fined each offender Â£2 plus costs.
