Editorial on the New Education Act.  The Act now required children to attend school not less than 4 times a week if the school were open 6 times a week, or 6 times a week if it were open 8 times, or 8 times a week if it were open 10 times.  (Mornings and afternoons were considered ‘times of opening’.)  This applied only to the Electoral Districts of Adelaide, Pt Adelaide, Torrens and other Corporate Districts.  This latter provision included Burra.  Thee result was to increase compulsory attendance from 35 to 48 days each quarter.
