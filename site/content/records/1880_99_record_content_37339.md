J. Melville writes from Broken Hill complaining that he is well-known as a professor of horse taming and feels the recent reports that did not name the gentleman who stole Mr Halls’ horse etc. attack his reputation.

The editor gladly identifies the recent ‘Professor’ as using the name Carter while in the town.
