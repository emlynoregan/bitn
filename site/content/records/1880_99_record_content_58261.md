Burra Town Council, 1 October.

The Finance Committee is to devise a scale of charges for the use of the oval and shed.

St Mary’s Cricket Club will be allowed to keep equipment in the shed.

Expenses of the shed are to be shared with the Show Society.

Financial position of each Ward to be ascertained for next meeting.

There was a rather petulant exchange between Cr Hardy & Cr Sampson over the filling of some ruts.

The Mayor reported the completion of the assessment and the Town Clerk reported that it was done according to the agreement.

Cr Hardy moved the Council reassemble on 8 October to consider the assessment ‘when it would be most likely that other councillors would object to sanction the assessment at all’.

The Mayor asked if they were just to throw it away.

Cr Hardy ‘didn’t care whether it was thrown away or not’.
