Burra Burra Mines

Some men of experience thought that this mine would have a brilliant, but short career; others predicted that after seven years discoveries would have been made of yet richer and more durable sources of wealth.  This group seem to have been borne out by the recent announcement of the discovery of a magnificently large and rich lode of red oxide in new ground at a depth of only 12 fathoms.  When the most recent news was despatched the extent of the lode was still not known, but the impression was that a thousand men might profitably be employed, even without the resumption of mining at the lower levels, which has been suspended due to the rush of labour to the goldfields.
