The Mt Bryan Hotel is being improved with funds from the Historic Hotels Program.  Work includes painting, work on verandahs and provision of wheelchair access to toilets.

The hotel was built in 1856 and has been a key feature of the town for nearly 150 years.

[The present Mt Bryan Hotel was built in 1881 and granted a licence in 1882.  The earlier hotel was a short distance north on the highway.]
