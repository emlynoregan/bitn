Burra Town Council, 15 January

Water Supply Dept. presented a bill for £50 for the Children’s Playground.

The Mayor said it was accumulated back rates.  The water was now cut off.

[The sum was corrected in the next issue to £5.]

M.W. Bednall advised that the Committee of the Tennis Club had prohibited Sunday play and would deal with any infringement.  Council agreed to meet a deputation from Kooringa Tennis Club on 5 February concerning their purchase of the courts.

Council agreed to buy a new horse.

Cr Kellaway moved to rescind the motion banning parking in part of Market Square.  Passed.

Cr Dow then moved that vehicles over 13ft be banned from parking from the north end of Bruce’s to R.D. Pascoe’s.  Carried.

Last year’s assessment was adopted with the necessary changes.
