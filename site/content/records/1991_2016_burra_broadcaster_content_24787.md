The North-Eastern Combined Schools Sports Association will hold its last sports day at Booborowie Oval on 6 April.  The Association started holding sports days in 1936 and eleven schools have competed at some stage over the 65 years: Booborowie North, Booborowie South, Spalding, Willalo, St Joseph’s, Leighton, Hilltown, Washpool, Yakilo, Hallett & Mt Bryan.  Now only Mt Bryan and Booborowie remain and it has been decided to close down the NECSSA.
