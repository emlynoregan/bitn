The RSL Annual Dinner was held on 1 December and drew ten official guests and 94 members.  It was ten years to the day that the local sub-branch had acquired the premises and an immense amount of time had been put into improvements and redecorating.  After the speeches and toasts the evening was passed in reminiscences, billiards, table tennis and darts.
