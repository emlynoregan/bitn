Burra Mine.  Following an announcement that an English company is seeking permission from the Treasury to erect a Â£350,000 smelter 200 miles north of Alice Springs to treat copper ore, an endeavour will be made to interest the company in developing the untouched sulphide ores beneath the old Burra Mine.  Data has been airmailed to England with this object in view.
