Burra Celebrates VE Day

On Wednesday, the official VE Day the town was gay with bunting and shop windows were decorated with the flags of the allies.  Burra citizens gathered to give thanks for the cessation of hostilities in Europe.  The gathering was organised by the Burra Civic Authorities and the Burra Ministers’ Fraternal.  Rev. H. Hobbs read the lesson.  Rev. M.P. Cowle gave a splendid address, which is reported at length.

For the Civic Ceremony the Mayor, Dr Steele and Mr H.J. B. Jennison took up positions at the foot of the monument in Market Square.  G.H. Dollman led the public in the singing of The Song of Australia and There’ll Always be an England.

The Mayor delivered a speech paying tribute to Great Britain and her allies and to those who had joined the fight.  He also referred to the continuing struggle against Japan and the 25,000 Australian prisoners of war in Japanese hands.

Dr Steele considered the feelings of those in liberated Europe and he also reflected that ‘a powerful nation of savage brutal yellow skinned devils had to be completely subjugated and destroyed before peace truly came to Australia’.  He also made reference to the conference in San Francisco from which he hoped ‘would issue a spirit that would permeate all nations leading to the evolution of a world which would give peace and happiness, bring goodwill and abound in charity’.

Mr Jennison reflected on how long ago it seemed when he and others had stood at the Rotunda and pledged themselves to the service of their King and Country at the outbreak of war.  As well as reflecting on the jubilation felt in Europe, he too referred to the tremendous task facing them in the subjugation of Japan.
