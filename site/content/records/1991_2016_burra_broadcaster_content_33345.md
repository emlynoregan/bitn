Burra CFS & Burra SES will receive $500 each from a cheque for $2,574 presented to emergency services involved in the salvage operations when a B-double loaded with pineapples overturned near Burra on 31 January.  The cheque came from Robinvale Transport Group who owned the load.  Crews worked throughout the night retrieving and repacking the load so that only three palettes out of 46 were lost.
