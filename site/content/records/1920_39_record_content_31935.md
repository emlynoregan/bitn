Federal Election.  Mr Hawker addressed a meeting at Kooringa on Thursday last week supported by Hon. G.F. Jenkins, Commissioner of Crown Lands, and Mr P.A. McBride.  Hon. W.G. Duncan was also present and the Mayor A.B. Riggs introduced the speakers.

Mr McBride spoke to introduce the candidate and spoke of his family and his history in the Liberal Federation.

Mr Hawke rose to speak as a heavy shower rattled on the roof.  He thanked Mr McBride and Mr Jenkins for their support and went on to describe the precarious state of the primary industries and the need to free Australia from the ‘rotten Arbitration system’.  Last year little wheat was grown at a profit and this year most wool production will make a loss.  Arbitration must be scrapped.  Any Federal system would be bad.  He also spoke against the system of many different awards for workers employed in the same factory, but insisted his views were not an attack on the standard of living of workers.  He saw State based awards as less pernicious.  He could not under the present circumstances support either child endowment or national insurance, though he was not opposed in principal at the right time.  He spoke of SA’s disadvantaged position with respect to Federal grants.  He disagreed with the more extreme form of protection offered to industries like sugar, peanuts and bananas as supported by the Country Party.  He went on to accuse the Country Party of rejecting proposals to amalgamate the conservative interests in their fight against Labor and explained why as a result he was contesting a seat with Mr Collins.

Mr Jenkins then spoke in support of Mr Hawker.

A summary of the correspondence between the Liberal Federation and the Country Party over unity proposals in their opposition to Labor is then printed.
