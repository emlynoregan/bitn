Burra Athletic & Cycling Club.  The first road race in connection with this recently formed club created great interest on Saturday and a large crowd assembled in Market Square to see the riders sent on their way over the 5-mile course.  Riders went to Aberdeen then via Copperhouse Road to Dew’s Corner and back past the Hospital to end at the Billiard Saloon in Market Square.  Bob Morton was first, then Les Irlam, Cyril Baker & Jack Cockshell.  Cockshell was leading at Dew’s Corner when he unfortunately fell bringing down several riders and causing a deal of gravel rash.  The intended foot race at the football on 9 June will not take place due to lack of local runners.
