Yesterday Kooringa was graced with the appearance of Rounseville’s [sic: for Rounsevell’s] splendid turn-out of four greys in a handsome carriage.  In the carriage were seated Edward Stephens Esq., John Brown Esq. and some ladies, driven by Mr Rounseville.  People rushed to their doors to get a look at this gay equipage.

The reports of gold around about are numerous, but nothing has yet been confirmed that would induce a rush and the inhabitants are not disposed to believe all they hear.
