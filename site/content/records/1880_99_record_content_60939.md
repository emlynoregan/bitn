Editorial on the Burra Mounted Rifles.

After 4½ years of valuable service this corps has been forced to disband on account of compulsory and unnecessary measures introduced by the Government.  The vote against continuing was unanimous.  Previously each man had the chance of making from £4-£5 p.a., now, however hard they work and at however much inconvenience they can get only £3-10-0.  The company could boast 40 good and active men and at every inspection they were eulogised for their general appearance, drill, shooting etc.

To become a member it is necessary to keep a horse and with chaff at between £3 and £4 per ton the game is not worth the candle.  Even if most members are farmers they have to resort to the haystack on account of the bad season.  The amount received from the Government went in shoeing and in buying extra ammunition to become a first-class shot in order to get the £5.  The gradual economies introduced have been submitted to, but the most recent have proved too much.  The company was being compelled to have one lieutenant, one sergeant, a shoeing smith, one bugler and two corporals.  The city company can boast 251 men and 131 officers.  The proposal was to stick Lieutenant Field here with 25 or as many new members as could be induced to join.  He would have had to have travelled 200 miles p.a. to attend drills and would be fined for not doing so.  While this travelling has always been a requirement there were previously no fined for non-attendance.

‘The least the Government can do is to show their appreciation in another and better form to encourage our noble defenders to fight for their hearth and home.’
