Redruth Reformatory.  On Thursday there was another escape from the Reformatory.  Bertha Learmouth, Ruby Cotter & Dolly Mansel scaled the wall.  Each was cut by the glass on top of the wall and Learmouth severely sprained her ankle dropping to the ground.  The others sought solace at the Bon Accord Hotel where Cotter stayed the night, but Mansel was returned to the ‘school’ before midnight.
