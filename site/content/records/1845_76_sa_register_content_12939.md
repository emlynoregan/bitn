Education Board Report

A.H. Forder of Redruth wrote thanking the Board for an increased stipend.  In another letter he applied for a renewal of his teacher’s licence for the current year.  He says a new school is to be opened by Mr Motley.

A decrease in his own school was therefore expected, but he hoped to retain his pupils by a diligent attention to his duties and he did not think any great permanent injury would result.

Mr Arthur Motley wrote seeking a form to apply for a teacher’s licence for himself and his wife.  He intended to use the Primitive Methodist Chapel at Redruth and his application was incidental to Mr Forder’s probable resignation.  He was able to produce testimonials.  The Board did not think they could issue an additional licence for that locality at this time.
