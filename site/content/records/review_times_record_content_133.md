Burra show Society.  In his annual report President Ron Shipard said the main improvement this year had been the extension of the show ring.  He thanked the District Council and Roocke Bros. [sic: Roche Bros?] for their assistance.  The last show had been a great success, but a misunderstanding about admission prices had cost them about $400 on the day.
