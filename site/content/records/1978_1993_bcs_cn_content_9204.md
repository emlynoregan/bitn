Tennis.  Burra & District Tennis Finals.  [The exact meaning is not clear as to whether these are semi-finals, preliminary finals or grand finals; though the B Grade at least cannot have been grand finals.]

A Grade	Hallett 11 sets defeated Burra Blue 9 sets

B Grade	Spalding White 13 defeated Burra Gold 7

Burra Blue 11 sets v Hallett 6 sets when the match was abandoned due to rain.

‘Most of the matches were completed to the final stage and were abandoned due to weather.’

To be completed when convenient for players.
