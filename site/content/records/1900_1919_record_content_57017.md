Peace Overtures.  On Sunday evening news was received that Germany had offered to accept President Wilson’s peace terms.  Monday morning saw the town virtually enveloped in bunting.  A meeting in Market Square was decided on for 3 p.m.  The schoolchildren were marched under Messrs Hitchcox & Biddle.  The Ladies’ band & Men’s band combined forces and marched from the Cheer-up Room and played several selections.  Speeches were given by the Mayor, Rev. H.H. Hopton, Rev. A.J. Finch, Cr Radford & Mr Winnall.
