Kooringa Court

Pascual Benito, a muleteer in the services of the Patent Copper Co., was charged by William Edwards with assault.

Edwards was employed at the Smelting Words.  On 11 May he had wheeled a barrow-load of coal into the workshop and on the way out Benito had seized him by the throat and uttered something in Spanish and then picked up a sledge-hammer and held it in the defendant’s face.  Benito said that Edwards owed him £3 and not being able to demand it in English, took this method of making his demand clear.  Edwards denied having £3 of Benito’s.  Judgement was deferred.

William Gendall was charged with cutting and stabling Robert Wallis that (Saturday) morning.

Jane Wallis, wife of the complainant, said she and the wife of the prisoner had had some words, followed by some throwing of things at each other.  Her husband tried to part them and in doing so had struck the defendant’s wife on the knee.  Her husband and the prisoner had commenced quarrelling and challenged each other to a fight.  She could not say who started it.  Saw no knife in the prisoner’s hand, but saw it on the ground outside the door.  A man had picked it up and given it to her.  She closed it and put it in her pocket.  She identified the knife produced.  She did not know her husband had been stabbed until he asked a man to fetch a doctor.  He stripped himself and she saw blood run onto the floor.  The wound was a deep one.  She said both men were sober.  Dr T.H. Mayne said the wound on the thigh was a dangerous one.  It was a large incised would, about four inches long and one and a half inches deep.  Given its position, it could have been more dangerous.

Remanded for one week in the hope the prosecutor might by then be well enough to attend.
