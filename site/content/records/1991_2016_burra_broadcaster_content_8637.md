Mt Bryan Uniting Church

When it was decided to close the church, locals rallied and encouraged others to keep services in the town.  They asked the presbytery for support, which came in the form of a cluster of ministers who attended at various times.  Members have risen and fellowship has blossomed to a dozen or so attending regularly.  A service will be held this Sunday at 2 p.m., when a lay ministry team will be commissioned.
