Burra Christmas Fair drew a good crowd for the floats and displays that participated in the pageantry and colour.  At the start it appeared that more people would participate that would observe, but as the event started more observers appeared.  The Burra swimming Club provided a barbecue and further up the street hot cappuccinos and biscuits were available.  A giant jumping castle and other entertainments were provided for the tiny tots.  Matt Reilly did a great job as emcee.  The Burra Leisure Activity Group had the best float, The Wiech family had the best Christmas Light Display and Tom Wiech had the best decorated bike.
