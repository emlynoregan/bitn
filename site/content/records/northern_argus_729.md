Burra Burra DC, February meeting

Council approved in principle the formation of a Burra Heritage Advisory Committee.

The committee is envisaged as being made up of top class professionals as well as community and Council representatives and would, it is believed, become a valuable consultative body.

Its brief could include preparation of a long term management plan for Burra as well as comment and assistance on projects like the Market Square redevelopment.

John Barton, pharmacist at Burra and a Councillor, was naturalised at a ceremony at the Civic Centre on 10 February.  [Photo.]

The 24 Hour Swimming Marathon last weekend raised almost $4,000.  Keryl Maidment raised the most money with $201.

Tourist Officers from various regions met at Burra last Tuesday 11 February for the Inland Tourism Seminar.  Cr Des Woolley as Chairman of the Burra Tourist Association chaired the meeting, which was held to discuss their proposed Inland Australia Ring Route.  The ring is roughly Broken Hill to Peterborough to Burra, then Morgan, Renmark, Mildura, Wentworth and Broken Hill.  There are opportunities to strike out from places en route to the Flinders Ranges or the Clare Valley.  Burra Burra DC Chairman Mr James Hawker was the guest speaker, resplendent in his 1830s attire.

He said Burra’s chief tourist resources were its fine examples of mid Victorian buildings and its copper mining heritage.  He outlined the Council’s actions:

The purchase of a building for use as a tourist office

Appointment of a Tourist Officer

Purchase of other heritage items

Has sought publicity through supporting activities like the Barrow Push

Tourism meant employment.  In 1982 14,000 visited the Burra Tourist Office and in 1985 there were 30,000 visitors. Jenny O’Connor Burra’s Tourist Officer also addressed the meeting, during which she paid tribute to the work of historian Ian Auhl.
