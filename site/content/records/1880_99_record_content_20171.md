Burra Waterworks

These were initiated in the Mayoralty of Mr Lockyer and continued in that of Dr Brummitt and have caused great anxiety and dealings with the Hydraulic Engineer have been difficult.  He supplied few details and dismissed our queries.  We have protested against taking over the old works at the cost listed and hope the Commissioner of Public Works will eventually see the justice of our position.  It will probably take four months to get the extra land we seek at the shaft site.  The engine was in the colony several months before we were told and now red tape is delaying things.  Though costs have exceeded expectations, my faith in the scheme is not shaken.  Apart from the water supply with its incalculable benefits, I believe it will be a financial success.

[Figures are then printed outlining the costs.]

Total cost to date, £6,876-0-0

The engine shed and land will bring this to an estimated £7,376
