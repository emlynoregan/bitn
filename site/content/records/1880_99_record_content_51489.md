God Save the Queen

At the concert on Wednesday the last item by Mr Jude was the song Home Boys Home, after which he left the stage.  The audience waited and he returned and played an encore and after heavy applause left again and when the audience stayed the secretary then returned to say that after a very heavy season at the Adelaide Town Hall he could not be expected to continue all night.  The audience slowly left wondering why he had not played God Save the Queen.

Mr Jude, talented instrumentalist and composer paid a flying visit to Burra on Wednesday and played to a well-filled hall.  His much-appreciated performance is reviewed item by item.
