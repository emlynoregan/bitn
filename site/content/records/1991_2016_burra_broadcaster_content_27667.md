BBH Football Club.  The Mini Colts coach for 2002 is Greg Kellock.

The night trial game was a winner and 200 supporters turned out to watch.

BBH Netball Club has conferred life membership on Mich Phin.  She has been involved with the club for 17 years.  She started with church netball aged 8, joined Contax when 15 and played with them for 15 years, mostly in the A2 side, but in 1977 for A1 and was selected for the State U21 side.  She moved to Booborowie after marriage and has been heavily involved with netball there ever since, coaching and playing through the 1980s and 1990s and has also been involved with coaching and management.
