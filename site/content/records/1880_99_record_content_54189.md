Burra Town Council

On 20 June war was declared on the Waterworks Engineer and on Monday the attack was followed up.  The engineer however escaped after 3½ hours of talking.

Obituary.  Richard Andrews who died at his Ayers St residence on Wednesday, aged 49, arrived in Burra 20 years ago and worked in the mine for two or three years until it closed and then for the Burra Town Council.  He was a member of the Oddfellows Lodge and a large procession of its members marched to the cemetery.  The Mayor, all Councillors and Inspector Gray also attended.

St Mary’s.  The Anglican Bishop of Adelaide preached three excellent sermons to very large congregations last Sunday and at the 11 o’clock service confirmed 13 candidates.
