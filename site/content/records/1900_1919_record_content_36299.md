Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting, Burra Institute 21 November.

Attendance was the largest for years at about 300 compared with last year’s 6.

Mayor’s Report.

The season promises to be the best for some time and both farmers and pastoralists will have had a good year.  This prosperity augurs well for the town.  Since the last report we have lost Philip Lane, our first Mayor and we have named one of our garden plots Lane Garden as a fitting, though insufficient, recognition.

We were able to buy the Burra Creek south of the [Kingston St] Bridge and through the influence and good services of Hon. J. Lewis MLC about 35 acres north of it to the rear of the Mill, including the plantation, or Jubilee Avenue.

The visit of the American boys was a pleasant interlude from which an invalid chair was bought for the hospital and a donation sent to Minda Home.

Electric lighting has progressed as far as permission being given for its establishment and power to raise money for it.  The next step is the consent of the Commissioner of crown Lands, who has been applied to, but no reply has yet been received.  If the answer is yes, then I suggest we hasten slowly, drawing on the experience of others.

The ornamental gardens, at first scoffed at by some, have since met with universal approval.

The seaside trip for children was an unqualified success and though not actually a municipal matter, it was started by the Council.

The increased lighting of the school owes much to the School Board, whose members are mostly members of Council and the Council fought successfully to retain the stopping of the Broken Hill express at Burra.  The hospital is vested in the Council and a renovation is now in hand.

The general account is currently c. £47 in credit, though it will be in debit c. £20 by the year’s end.

The gong at the Bon Accord crossing has been established.

The Burra Coronation Band continues successfully.

Though details are not finalised, the Hon. J. Lewis MLC has bought Paxton Square and handed it over to Council as housing for the poor.  Letting etc. is to be controlled by the Mayor of the day, a nominee of Mr Lewis and the ministers of the town.  [Anglican, Methodist and Catholic.]  Income is to be used in renovation without profit.

Cr Lowe retires after many terms service with my thanks for his years of attention to North Ward interests.  [He served December 1907 to November 1913.]

The adoption of the report was moved by E. Crewes and 2nd Mr Fuss.
