Burra Town Council, 15 March.

Council decided it could not help in the Boy Scouts’ attempt to raise a £10,000 endowment fund.

A deputation waited on Council about the Soldiers’ Memorial.  They reported the decision of the General Committee and asked for a position in Market Square.  The centre of the base to be in a direct line from the southwest corner of Lord’s kerbstone in a direct line to the Record window and 48 feet northwest of  the rotunda fence.  They asked that 12’6” north of the northern line of the base and 6’ on the east and west sides be set aside for possible future beautification.  The memorial would be protected by four granite posts connected by chains and the King Edward Memorial [Rotunda] would not be affected.

The Mayor said Council would have to consider the matter carefully.

Council will inspect the site on Wednesday at 5 p.m.

Cr Radford moved that the fence between the Bowling Green and the Depot be protected from the horses.

Cr Broderick considered the Council needed a more efficient way of spreading tar.  Particulars of a proposed machine will be obtained.
