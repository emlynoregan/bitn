In Memoriam

OLD NELLY

Beneath the sod she lightly trod,

Obedient, slow or fast,

Relieved from care, my trusty mare

Old Nelly rests at last.

Ah, many’s the day, o’er hill and dale,

For twenty years and more,

She, true as steel, obeyed my will,

Without the whip or spur.

As old friends share their sympathy

We sympathetic grew,

Her glance would say “you’re kind to me

And I’ll be kind to you.”

Yet, as best of friends must part -

With regret I say farewell;

Her equal I shall ne’er again possess,

My old and faithful Nell.

W.F. COGLIN
