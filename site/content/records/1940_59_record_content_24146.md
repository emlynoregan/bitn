Weather.  The last week provided the whole gamut of weather types for Burra.

The week started with pleasant spring conditions, followed by heat and dust storms on Wednesday and then a cool change on Thursday.  Overnight more than a quarter inch of rain fell and Friday was very cold, with useful showers in the afternoon.  On Friday night rain set in steadily and continued for some eleven hours.  At about 6 a.m. large flakes of snow fell with the rain.  Snow continued to fall at intervals through Saturday morning, but rain meant it did not linger on the ground.  Heavier falls of snow have been reported from Hallett and Mt Bryan and the hills east of Belcunda carried a mantle of white.  It may be recalled that snow fell in this locality about three days before Christmas about nine years ago.
