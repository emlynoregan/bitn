The report said Mrs Gwenyth Mosey nee Gosling was a daughter of Mr Arthur Gosling, but she was a granddaughter.  Mr Arthur Gosling, who first worked for the previous owners from 1892, bought the business in 1907.  He also had stores at Pt Wakefield and Halbury.  His eldest son Percival Arthur Gosling took over the management from his father in 1910 and later purchased the business.  Arthur Edward Gosling moved to Adelaide.  Percival Arthur Gosling moved from Pt Wakefield at this time.  Mrs Gwen Mosey nee Gosling who cut the ribbon was born in the cottage in December 1911 as was a son Rex Percival in 1915 and the family lived in the cottage from 1910 to 1919, when Percival sold the business and moved to Waikerie to take up a fruit orchard.  Mrs Eileen Fleming nee Gosling and Mrs Gwenyth Mosey nee Gosling are the only surviving members of the family who resided in the cottage, their brother having died in 1991.
