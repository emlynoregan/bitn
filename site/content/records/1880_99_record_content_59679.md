Burra Races were held last Wednesday.  The course was in splendid condition.  The attendance was less than expected, but those who attended got a good day’s sport.  The Totalizator was very poorly patronised with only about £116 passing through it.  The Burra Band attended.  There were six races of which the main race was the Burra Handicap over 1½ miles.  It was won by H. Gillett’s Coorie.  First prize was £25 and 2nd was £5.
