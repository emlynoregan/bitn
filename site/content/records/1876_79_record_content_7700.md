Cricket. The first match in Burra for the season (if we may call it a match) was the farce of Burra v. Clare on Saturday. We were surprised a few weeks ago when Hallett beat them, but the Saturday game was an utter farce -`several even being run out by their captain*. Clare 108 defeated Burra 8 & 49.

*The scorecard shows one run-out in each innings.
