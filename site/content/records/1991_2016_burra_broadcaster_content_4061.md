Maureen Wright writes concerning the old red telephone box at Burra North.  Telecom says the maintenance of the box is the responsibility of the town.  They say it is the last working wooden telephone box.  Unfortunately it has suffered some vandalism and also has some wood rot.  I would like to hear from any community group or person willing to help either physically, verbally or financially.
