[Though not specified, it would seem from the above that the six missions were then: Gum Ck, Farrell’s Flat, Black Springs, Hallett, Mt Bryan and Booborowie, unless Mt Bryan East was a separate entity.]

In 1890, the last year that St Mary’s stood alone without mission churches, the income was put at £1,369 – more than for any other church in SA, partly because in that year the debt of £825 was abolished.  The Bishop’s Home Mission Society assisted the Hallett Mission by £4 in 1891 and now helps by £70.

At Mt Bryan, five years ago services were held in the Institute, even carrying the organ across the railway line for services.

The new church opens with a debt of £150, having spent £460 on building and furniture.  The Ven. Archdeacon Bussell officiated.  W.B. Page, organist of St Mary’s, played for the service of dedication.

The stone comes from the Burra quarries of Henry Thomas.  The nave is 30’ x 19’ and rises 25’6” to the ridge.  The chancel is in the form of an apse.

Donors of various furnishings are then listed.
