Mr & Mrs Ian Auhl write a letter to the editor re the comments of Mrs M. Wright on the Princess Royal garden party.

We were surprised to read that this occasion was ‘the first time a tour of a period building had been organised.’

‘We were also surprised, as no doubt Mrs A. Tennant of Princess Royal might have been, to read that “people did not realise the building was privately owned and therefore not open to the public.”’

For the record the Burra Branch of the National Trust organised three previous visits and inspections of Princess Royal.  Mr & Mrs Andrew Tennant were founders of the Burra Branch and the first visit took place at their invitation on Sunday 1 October 1967 in conjunction with the Adelaide and Waikerie Branches.

The second occurred on Sunday 11 May 1969, as part of a 3-day Seminar ‘The Historic Copper Towns of SA’, which was a joint effort of the Burra Branch of the National Trust and the Department of Adult Education of the University of Adelaide.

A third visit was on 19 April 1970, when the Burra Record of 21 April 1970 reported 1,000 visitors and $900 was raised for the Burra Branch.

‘Having played a large part, along with Mr Lewis Moore, Me Stanley J. Woollacott and Dr Derek Whitelock, in organising these visits, I feel justified in seeking space for the correction of the information given by Mrs Maureen Wright.’

‘Surely with the micro-film of the ‘Burra Record’ and the minutes of the Burra Branch at her disposal, Mrs Wright could have referred to these earlier visits to and inspections of Princess Royal, all by invitation of Mrs and (the late Mr Andrew Tennant.'
