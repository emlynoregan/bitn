Burra Town Council 14 March

The two South Ward councillors, Sampson and Lewis, continue to be at loggerheads over the allotment of £110 to the Kangaroo St Bridge.  Cr Dunstan gave notice that if they do not resolve the matter themselves he will move at the next meeting that the whole Council do so.

The Mayor reported on the Market Square well as above.  Also that the pipes recent inserted will be removed again and sold, leaving just 6” piping for the first 32’ after which the rock will be as secure as any piping.

Several poor people had their rates remitted.

Sir Henry Ayers asked that the gift of an allotment in the cemetery by SAMA to Mr Patterson [? Print unclear] might be recognised.  Agreed.
