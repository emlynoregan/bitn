Proposed Railway to the Murray.  A letter to the Editor from Charles Simeon Hare.

[This is a very long letter and goes into a lot of detail on routes, construction and working costs, the source and security for capital and the consequences of the development for the colony as a whole and for Adelaide and Port Adelaide in particular.]

The general direction of the line.  The most direct line would be through the Mt Lofty Ranges and thence to the thirty-nine sections.  The second best would be via Gawler, Light’s Pass, Truro to North West Bend.  The cost of the former option would be prohibitive due to the rugged country.  The second line would also involve constructing a line through a gorge.  The third and easiest/cheapest route would be to Gawler and thence via the Light Scrub to Nankervis’s public house and thence to Baldina, the Fingerpost to the Great Bend.  There are no great physical obstacles on this route.  The Burra Burra Mines could be reached via the east side of the ranges and the Mine traffic alone would justify the expenditure.  Thus the one line could embrace the Burra and the Murray traffic.

Cost.  The third option would be of 160 miles and should be at a cost of about £9,000 per mile or in all £1,215,000.  Use of Barlow’s rails could reduce this to £1,134,000.  [Hare goes on to consider the costs of rolling stock and suggests it should be made locally (except for the wheels).]

The Traffic.  The best enquiries I have made suggest an annual 100,000 tons of traffic lies north, beyond the Light.  The Burra Burra Mines and the Smelting Co. would supply much of this.  The Smelting Works alone have a traffic in copper ore and coal of 20,000 tons per annum.  There are at present 4,000 tons of coal at Port Wakefield awaiting cartage to Kooringa.  The present cost of coal delivered at Burra is £7 per ton and this prevents poor ores from being handled.  The mine and the Smelting Works would both undergo great development if the railway were built to the Murray.  The railway would pass through the great scrub, which would provide timber traffic; it is only 24 miles from the Burra and the wood could be carried there at 3d per ton per mile.  It could get to the furnaces for 9/- per ton.  At three tons of wood to make the equivalent of one ton of coal, it would cost £1-10-0 compared with the cost of coals, varying from £4 to £7 per ton.  Many poorer mines, like Karkulto could become viable if the railway were built.                          The other source of traffic of course the people at the diggings.  I am informed there are some 300,000 there.  I assume that 200,000 could be reached via this road, thence by water to Maiden’s Punt, and then by dray via Campaspie to Bendigo.

[He then goes into calculations to show that SA flour could be delivered to Bendigo at a delivery cost of £7-10-0 per ton.  This he calculates would price SA flour in Bendigo at £25 per ton, which could not be matched by other sources.  He goes on to calculate how much traffic this would be likely to generate.  He passes lightly over the other traffic on the line from a variety of sources along the way and concludes it is a great investment and in his view well worth the risk involved in the massive borrowings to finance it.]
