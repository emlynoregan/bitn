Burra Town Council, 17 May

Brigadier Martin replies that there are too few members of the regiment around Burra to make it a viable place to camp.

There was a debate about planting trees and why it hadn’t been done in North Ward in the holes in rock blasted for them.

Cr Jeffery said it was a matter for North Ward and Cr Jennison was absent.  Cr Dow said it was a Parklands matter.

It was decided to remove the trees on the school house corner.

The Mayor expressed disagreement with the work being done on the Mine Bridge, which increased the road’s height so it would be easy for a car to tip over the wall of the bridge.
