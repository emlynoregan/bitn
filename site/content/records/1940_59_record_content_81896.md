Burra Hospital

Thanks to Rural Youth for £20 for a ramp as an entrance to the eastern side of the Hospital.

A fence in the northeast corner of the hospital has been erected by Messrs W.H. Lloyd, T. Beckwith, C. Webster, W. Nankivell, C. Earle and F. Atkin.  [88, 27, 22 July 1958, page 1: delete the last two names in this list and substitute R. Earle and W. Lee.]  Cement posts and strainers were donated by G.H. Cockrum, T. Beckwith and Koonoona Proprietors.  A smaller one will later be extended past the Nurses’ Quarters.  Thanks are extended to all who helped.
