The Lane Inkstand

In 1882 the first Mayor of Burra was presented with a silver and gilt inkstand fashioned out of an emu egg with an Australian scene in silver and supported by a stand and silver figures.  It was the work of Wendt’s Jewellers of Adelaide.  On Friday Mr Max Lane, a great grandson of Burra’s first Mayor, Mr Philip Lane, presented the inkstand to the Burra Burra DC.  It is currently valued at $15,000.  The Chairman of the DC, Mr Graham Kellock, accepted the gift on behalf of the community.  [Photo]
