Obituary/Inquest.  A shepherd came in from Mr Vickery’s station on Friday and asked Mr Wilkinson, chemist, for some medicine for his wife.  Mr Wilkinson offered to go and see the wife, but the man said that was not necessary and Mr Wilkinson prescribed according to the symptoms.  When the man arrived home he found his wife was dead.  Mr MacDermott sat as coroner and Mr H. Corey was elected foreman of the jury.

John Paynter:

Was the husband of the deceased who had been ill for about ten years.  She had last seen a doctor when they were living at the Sturt.  About eight days ago she had complained of a very bad cold.  He had fetched some medicine and afterwards she had seemed better.  His duties took him away all day and when he returned yesterday his wife was much worse again.  She did not want the doctor, but in the evening he went in for some medicine and when he returned she was dead.  Deceased had complained of a pain in her side ever since one of her confinements in England, when the doctor had said the child had grown to her side.

Sarah Elizabeth Paynter:

The deceased was her mother and had complained of great pain and weakness in her back since Tuesday week.  She was taken worse last night and witness had gone to Vickery’s for medicine.  Deceased had gone into a cold sweat and was still.  She went to Vickery’s and Miss Vickery and Hallett’s servant returned with her.  She had been alone with her mother when she died.  [Other symptoms are given.]

Dr Mayne:

Had seen the body, but it was not easy to conclude the caused of death.  It was possible dysentery was the immediate cause.  He thought death was from natural causes and the jury found that deceased had died from visitation of God, from natural causes.

[Hannah Paynter died 26 April 1861 at Wildoto aged 34.]
