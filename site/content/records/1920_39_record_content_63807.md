Redruth Methodist Church Back-to-Burra

Memorial services were held last Sunday.  Mr J. Radford rang the bell from 10.45 to 11 a.m.  He used to be the bell-ringer for the Primitive Methodist Church 45 years earlier when they held their services in what is now Jubilee Hall.  Rev. A. Dyer conducted the service and Rev. Martin gave the sermon.  Rev. Martin, who lived in Burra many years ago, has had to give up active work because of his failing eyesight.  A Back-to-Sunday School was held in the afternoon.  M.J. Morton welcomed scholars and visitors.  Mrs James Walker, Mr W. Gerard & Mrs J.G. Sara recounted some of their experiences of past days.  Mr J.A. Reed unveiled a beautiful framed photograph of his father Mr James Reed, which will hang in the porch as a memorial to his great work.  We are largely indebted to Mr James Reed for our beautiful Sunday school building.

Rev. Dyer conducted the evening service at 6.45 p.m. and the preacher was Mr A. Gerard of Adelaide.
