Burra Institute Committee met on 9 Feb.

It resolved among other matters not to invite the press to attend meetings.

The lodges asked to be able to hold meetings in the Council Chamber as the Lodge Room lacked privacy: the back door allowing anyone to listen in and it was also very cold in winter, while in summer throwing open the windows again lost them privacy.  The alternative was to erect an anteroom at the back of the lodge room.  Mr J. Sampson introduced these arguments which were supported by Mr Jones (Rechabites) and Mr W.H. Linkson (Foresters).

T. Pearce then asked on behalf of the lodges that closet and urinal accommodation be provided for lodge use.

The President said a notice re this was lying on the table to be discussed this meeting and the other matters would be considered and replied to.

A committee was appointed to consider the best mode of improving sanitary arrangements at the Institute, comprising the President (T. Edwards), Mr Wilkinson and Drs Brummitt & Sangster.

The request of the lodges required further debate and was adjourned to the next meeting.
