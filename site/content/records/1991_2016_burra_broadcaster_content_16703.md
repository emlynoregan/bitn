Goyder Council

On Monday Hallett community members and a large contingent of Robertstown residents attended Council to ask that the decision to close Council offices at Hallett and Robertstown be rescinded.  They addressed the Council and presented a petition.  They argued a lack of consultation and the need to promote stronger links with the community.  It was said the Robertstown office needs to be retained, bearing in mind its service to elderly people, the library service in the building and the various uses made of the rear of the building, such as for meetings and art and craft displays.  More than 80% of the townâ€™s population signed the petition.

Peter Rankin, for Hallett, said the Hallett CMC refused to represent the community on the issue.  Hallett had lost the Council Works Depot and the district clerk had moved to Burra.  As a consequence the Post Office had lost its biggest customer and was of questionable viability.  Assessed values of houses in Hallett were now totally unrealistic, as services decline.

A move by Cr Mosey to revoke the motion that the offices be closed was ruled invalid, when CEO Steve Kerrigan pointed out it could not proceed before the next Council elections.  Cr Don Pfitzner then moved the original motion be deferred pending further discussions.

[The outcome of that motion is not reported.]
