The floodwaters on Thursday threatened the small footbridge in front of the Post Office, (comprising simply three boards without side rail) when it rose to within two inches of the boards and over them in places.  Some children diverted to the Burra Hotel crossing which also need attention.

While the creek was running strongly in the morning Howard West, son of William West Sen. amused himself by running back and forth over the footbridge opposite the Post Office until he became giddy and fell in.  His screams and those of his brother were attracted Mr Vardey, who plunged in fully clothed and caught the drowning boy with some difficulty.  He was taken to the home of John McLaren where he was bathed and comforted before going home in a trap sent for him.
