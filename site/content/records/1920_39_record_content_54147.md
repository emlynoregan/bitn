Herb Allen formerly of Aberdeen visited Burra in the holidays for the first time in c. 16 years.  As a lad he was employed by the Burra Record, but now works for United Paint Co. of Port Adelaide.  He has also written two plays and had one performed a dozen times by an amateur dramatic club and the other is in rehearsal.  [Presumably Herbert William Allen (1900-83) the son of William Allen & Sarah Rogers.]
