Rough Notes on a Journey Northwards

[The style is a very verbose one with much elaboration.]

The train to Gawler passed by the villages of Enfield, Gepps Cross, Dry Creek and Little Para, but leaves them a considerable distance off to the right.

At Gawler the town has recovered from the extension of the railway to Kapunda.  There are several large shops, inns and the ponderous steam flour mills of Messrs Duffield and Harrison.  There are also some half a dozen agricultural machinery makers.  The legal and medical professions are well represented, as are religious establishments and the Institute. There are two banks and a telegraph station.

From Gawler to Kapunda the railway traverses inferior agricultural land and the line itself is rough.  The Kapunda station is elegant and excellent.  Kapunda is an amalgamation of a group of towns; Kapunda, Victoria, Helston etc.  It is seen to advantage better by approaching it by road rather than from the railway station.

Beyond Kapunda much of the land is pastoral, though agriculture is growing.  The mine employs 300 men and 40 boys.  The population of the town is about 2,000.  The houses are built of a soft stone that hardens on exposure.  The ‘Sir John Franklin’ is a fine-looking hotel and the North Kapunda hardly less so.  Stores have increased since the arrival of the railway.  There is a National Bank and the professions are well represented.  The Telegraph Station and Post Office are together.  There are one or two agricultural implement makers.  The churches are well represented and the newspaper the Northern Star is published there.

Continuing north we came to the dingy-looking build we discovered to be Forresters’ some 10 miles on.  We stayed overnight before going on to Riverton.  We entered up an area of sheep runs with an extensive and productive agricultural area off to the left around Macaw Creek, Rhynie, Baker’s and Humphrey’s Springs.

Riverton is laid out to be an extensive place.  There are several stores, one of which includes the Post Office.  There is a Court House, a Bible Christian Chapel and a church on the hillside.  An excellent steam flour mill has been erected.  There is dome good farming country to Saddleworth where there is a dilapidated-looking inn, a small chapel and Messrs Kingsborough & Seikmann’s store and nothing else.  From there we headed to Auburn.
