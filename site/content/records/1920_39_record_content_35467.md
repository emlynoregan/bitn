Burra Town Council, 1 September

The Treasurer advises that unnaturalised foreigners must not be used on relief works.

Cr Woollacott said the Government had advised it would be reducing both the main roads grant and the subsidy and that only Councils already promised money would have a chance of getting any of the proposed loan.

The MPs are to be asked to clarify the town’s position.

Council considered whether to rewrite the assessment or to have a new one.

Cr Woollacott thought it would not be right to spend £30-£50 on a new one.

Cr Kellaway moved for a rewriting and then to adjust the rates downwards.

The Mayor thought a high assessment and a low rate was poor policy.

Cr Woollacott [in apparent contradiction of his earlier stance] said he believed in a correct assessment.  House values had dropped 40% and the assessment was 4 years old.

The Town Clerk said the assessment was on rental and not capital values.

Cr Woollacott then moved that the assessment be rewritten with a 20% all round drop.

The Mayor said that Corporations were not allowed to do that.

Cr Pearce moved that the matter be given some thought and a decision be postponed to the next meeting and that amendment was finally carried.
