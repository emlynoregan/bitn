Two Day Manhunt

Burra became the focus of a manhunt for refugees who had escaped from Woomera Detention Centre last week.  Local officer Ashleigh Hale noticed a vehicle fitting the description of one being sought at a Kingston Street address on Tuesday.  The station wagon left the address soon after 6 p.m. and was pursued at speed along the Morgan Road.  It was stopped at gunpoint, but the occupants fled on foot into a saltbush paddock east of the Robertstown turnoff.  The driver was arrested.  Three of the fugitives were captured on Tuesday night and two others at about 3.30 p.m. Wednesday and the last one later that night.  The graffito ‘Freedom for Refugees Now’ was painted across the Kingston Street-Welsh Place intersection and the word ‘Freedom’ was painted on the door of the former Salvation Army Citadel – presumably associated with the same series of events.
