Dr R.C. Heddle gave an enlightening talk on drugs at the Town Hall on Friday night.  Door takings were $114.  It was organised by the M & BHA.  Dr Heddle had been overseas to assess the situation, attending conferences in Holland and New Zealand.  The news seemed to indicate that Adelaide had perhaps four or five years to prepare to handle drug problems of the proportions experienced overseas.

[Dr Heddle’s address is reported at length in about 1⅔ columns.]
