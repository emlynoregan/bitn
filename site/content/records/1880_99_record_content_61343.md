The deceased had been found about 8’ from the bank of the Torrens east of the St Peter’s boatshed.  He was a male child aged 2-3, 26½ lb and 2’10” tall.

Eliza Anderson, Wife of John Anderson, gave evidence of having cared for the child for 7/- a week for the 1st 12 months and for 5/- a week after that.  On Thursday 13 October the accused said she was going to take the boy to Adelaide and ‘put him in the destitute’, but added that she had an alternative of giving him to a woman in North Adelaide to adopt.

Marcella Mann, wife of William Mann of Hallett and sister-in-law of the accused, corroborated the above concerning the plans of 13 October.

After further evidence the jury retired, but could not agree and were discharged.

A new trial was commenced on Monday and the same evidence was presented.

This time when the jury returned they said they had ‘determined to give the prisoner the benefit of the existing doubt, and find her not guilty’.
