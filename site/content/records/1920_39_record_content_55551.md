Mr Warnes said at that time the firm was employing 71 people, excluding the family, including Koomooloo and Booborowie – among them six women and seven cooks.  They had 32,000 sheep.

The blowfly doubled the work on the pastoral areas and was one of the reasons so many men were employed on the station.  They were greatly disadvantaged by railway freight charges and as a consequence had obtained trucks and were now taking their wool direct to Port Adelaide.  [He mentioned having previously taken the wool by road to the railway at Mt Mary.]  There was also a considerable amount of back loading for the trucks.  He estimated they saved £200 a year: sufficient to pay for a new lorry in five years.  The railways would need to offer considerably more in concessions before he would return to them.
