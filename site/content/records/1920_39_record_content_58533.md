A garden has been established in front of the entrance to the ground.  The block has been fenced and planted.  Thanks go to Mr R.J. Fairchild, who has planned and fenced the area and planted the garden.  The Burra Town Council provided the land, fencing materials and shrubs.  This is the club’s effort towards beautifying the town for the State’s Centenary.  Mrs A.B. Riggs hit off the first ball to open the new season on Wednesday 6 November.  The result of the match played was a draw with Aberdeen and Burra scoring 66 points each.
