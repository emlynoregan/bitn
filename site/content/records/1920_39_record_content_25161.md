YMCA Sports Carnival on 10 December was preceded by a procession of decorated cars.  The Peterborough Brass Band led the way from Market Square to Victoria Park.  HMAS Dreadnought came first representing the Kooringa Dreadnoughts – junior girls’ team.  Next came an English Cottage at Christmas, representing All Reds (Kooringa Senior Girls).  Then came a Japanese car for the Pals, an Aberdeen Girls Team.  The Kooringa All White Team of Senior Girls had a car representing ‘spring’.  Senior Kooringa Boys ‘The Rovers’ had a car representing the Burra Record.  Aberdeen Woodpeckers (little girls) appeared as the YMCA.  Aberdeen Sports (senior girls) had a car representing cricket, tennis, golf and bowls.  An undecorated 1828 Buick Sports Model followed and then the All Reds had another car representing Harvest Time.  This was followed by a Christmas Tree Party, an oil steamer and finally the Rainbow by the ‘Invincibles’ (Kooringa Junior Girls).  The sports results are printed.
