Mt Bryan.  A ⅔ column article on Mt Bryan mentions that place as then having:

A Tennis Club	A Football Team

A newly formed Rifle Club	A State School with 30-40 children

A Literary Society	An Agricultural Bureau with c. 30 members

W. Bell’s General Store	Several town allotments have been bought

Charley Casaretto’s Hotel	A Dramatic Club

And in addition a local hall is being proposed.

The Methodists ‘can boast of one of the nattiest little church[es] desired in any country town’

Buildings are also either rented or given free for the Church of England, Catholic and Lutheran services.

Mt Bryan has had an influx of new settlers and only one or two pioneer residents have survived to see it.  Fruit and flower gardens are holding their own and vegetable gardens are extensive.   On older properties the older inadequate houses have been replaced by nice dwellings, but most new settlers are making shift with primitive homesteads.  Today there are about 60 farms in the district.  They are practical farmers getting the most from their land.  Mt Bryan’s jollifications in clued ‘at homes’, surprise parties etc.  Tennis is much practised and football will become more prominent.  Several town allotments have been sold.  Closer settlement is just the thing for the Mt Bryan District.
