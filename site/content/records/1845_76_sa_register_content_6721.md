Captain Bath pf the Princess Royal Mine appeared to answer the summons of Thomas Rosewall for £7-19-6 being the balance of wages due in respect of ore raised and dressed February to May 1850.  The argument depended on a deal of technical mining practice and eventually the Bench ruled that the defendant would pay the plaintiff £5-17-0 and each party would pay its own expenses.  The company was given till next Monday to pay.
