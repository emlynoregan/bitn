Ratepayers’ Meeting, for South Ward at Mr Mathews’ Schoolroom, Wednesday.

There was a very small attendance.

Mr Coglin, having been asked to stand addressed the group.  South Ward had the problem of many creek crossings and a small income to cover the outlay.  The road to the cemetery was an urgent need.  He felt this should not be a South Ward responsibility alone.   He was in favour of increasing the size of South Ward to increase income.  Cr Ward, who is retiring was not present.

Cr Sampson said the South Ward had available in 1883 £198 and had spent £199-8-11 and it had, he believed, been judiciously spent west of the creek and it was now time for the east side to see some expenditure.  He favoured the formation of an East and West Ward to divide monies more equitably.  Next year the expected income would be £250 to £300.
