Football.  The dispute over clearances in the Yakilowie Association is further discussed at some length by Leo Gill, Honorary Secretary of South Booborowie FC and J.H. Madigan replies ‘in justice to North Booborowie’ which had withdrawn from the association when South Booborowie and South Spalding voted together to force North Booborowie to forfeit matches and also awarded themselves a match each.  The resulting Premiership match was played at Booborowie on 3 September when South Spalding 6.5 (41) defeated South Booborowie 4.10 (34).
