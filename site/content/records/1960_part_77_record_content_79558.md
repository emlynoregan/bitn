Lyle Quinn, Roche Bros’ manager, is leaving Burra.  He came to the town in 1970 when Roche Bros. won the contract for earth moving at the Burra Mine for Samin Ltd.  He has been involved in other jobs outside the Mine, including site preparation for the new Golf Club.  He was responsible for starting Roche Bros. Social Club, which bought the Oddfellows’ Hall for its use and was also involved in the annual Miners’ Cabaret.  Now after 24 years of earthmoving and 20 years with Roche Bros. he is leaving Burra and the company.  He will go to manage a caravan park at Rushworth in Victoria; his hometown.  He has worked on a huge range of job types in earthmoving in NSW, ACT, SA and Tasmania (including King Island).  Dave Ball will take over his position in Burra as temporary manager.  The social club will continue with David Thamm as the new President.
