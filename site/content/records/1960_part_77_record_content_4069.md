Burra Amateur Swimming Club

Burra can be proud of its swimming pool, officially opened last January; four years after a small band of enthusiasts were told it was impossible.  However, the apathy displayed towards the AGM called for last Thursday suggests it may not take the next step to form a swimming club to promote swimming and diving, conduct carnivals and assist with the running of the pool so that it does not become the liability the Mayor was so anxious to avoid on the night of the public meeting of 2 March 1956.  The public is urged to attend the meeting now called for Monday 31 October to form a Swimming Club in Burra.
