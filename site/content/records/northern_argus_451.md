Broken Hill-Burra Barrow Push 1986

Plans are well under way for the West End-Toyota Great Barrow Push from Broken Hill to Burra according to Secretary Chris Reed.  Teams will assemble at Broken Hill on 21 January.  Team nominations close on 2 December.  The recent Clare-Burra Barrow Push was a great success.  Prizes for the 1986 Push:

1st, $10,000

2nd $1,000

3rd $500

There will also be a series of $1,000 prizes for the 1st Sporting Team, the 1st team over 40, the 1st team under 17, the 1st all female team and the 1st service club team.

The Prime Minister has been asked to present the prizes and if he is able to accept he will be the first PM to visit Burra since Billy Hughes in 1924*.  Burra breathers won the Clare-Burra Push.

[*This claim is incorrect.  W. Hughes visited twice as PM, on 28 August 1920 and 29 March 1922.  After that there was a visit by S.M. Bruce in March 1925 when he was PM and from J.B. Chifley when he was PM in 1946.]

The Mid North Regional Tourist Association had a three-day visit to Burra last week.  Members of the Board had a dinner at the Old Jinker Restaurant.  While in Burra the Board stayed at Paxton Square Cottages and had a tour of the town.
