Obituary.  Richard Hill died at his Kooringa residence on 10 February aged 73.  He was the husband of Mary Hill.

The late Mr Richard Hill who died at his home in Quarry St on 10 February was born in Upper Thames St on 4 August 1855 and his son Horace lives in the same house that looks little different after 75 years.  He was the eldest son of the late Mr & Mrs Ben Hill and was born soon after they arrived from England.  He was educated at Mr Oakford’s School conducted in the building on Paxton Square nearest the Black Bridge, but went to work very young, first minding cows and then at the mine until it closed.  He was then a labourer until his retirement from failing health.  His hobby was poultry raising and he took many prizes at shows in Burra, Adelaide and elsewhere.  In 1881 he married Mary White, third daughter of the late Mr & Mrs John White, old retainers of Koonoona Station.  He is survived by his wife, one daughter and three sons: Mrs John Quinn of World’s End and Messrs Benjamin, Horace & Charles.  Three sons saw service in the Great War: Ben, Sam & George.  Sam died in France and George of Wounds in England.  [Corrected the following week to four who saw active service by the addition of Horace.]  Three brothers survive: Sam (Semaphore), Steve (Melbourne), Charles (Kilkenny).  Three sisters also survive: Mrs J. French (Yarcowie), Mrs F. Bertram & Mrs W. Plane (Broken Hill.
