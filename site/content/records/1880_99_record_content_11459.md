Burra Public School held a picnic last Friday as a reward for the studentsâ€™ creditable performance at the late examination.  Headed by the Burra Brass Band they marched through Kooringa, Aberdeen and Redruth to the Police Paddock.  The youngest went in a wagon lent by Catchlove & Co.  The sports and treat were thoroughly enjoyed.
