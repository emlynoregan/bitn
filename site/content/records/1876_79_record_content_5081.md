Editorial on Burra Cemetery. The need for more room grows urgent. There seems some difficulty in getting the title from SAMA. Also there is a need for a water supply at the cemetery. There is a spring in the hills just above the enclosure and it should be easy to bring down a stream of fresh water to the plants in the cemetery.
