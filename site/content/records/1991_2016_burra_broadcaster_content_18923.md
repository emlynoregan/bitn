Burra & Districts Tourism Association held its AGM.  Bob Howell was re-elected President for its second year of operation.  Ian Williamson of the Commercial Hotel is Secretary and Delia Kraft is Treasurer.  Their biggest project has been the staging of the Jailhouse Rock weekend.  It was judged that a small loss on the $8,000 turnover was a fairly good result for the eventâ€™s first year.  Other issues discussed in year one included a Merino Museum, road signage and a town brochure.  Guest speaker was Janette Cousins, manager of the Burra Visitor Centre.
