Armistice Day was observed on Saturday morning at the Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial and was attended by a number of returned men and one nurse (Mrs D. Keynes nee Sister Armstrong), also by the Town Council and the local VSD led by Mrs A. Tennant.

[The reporter regrets that while all the scores of pedestrians were still for the 2 minutes’ silence, two or three cars drove past without stoping, though clearly aware of the ceremony.]
