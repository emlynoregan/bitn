Goyder Council has been a partner in the Regional Youth Bus Project.  Elected members were given a tour of the bus on 19 May.  It is an initiative of Barossa Lower North Futures and incorporates a youth facility with a Facebook page directed at 12-24-year-olds.  The bus will deliver fun activities, education and increasing support services to the region.  It has been supported by the department for Education and Child Development ICAN Program and a substantial donation from Energy Australia.  The bus contains the latest technologies, including gaming, music and WIFI.  [Photo.]
