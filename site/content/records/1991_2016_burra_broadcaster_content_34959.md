Marj Edmonds, as ‘Cousin Marjorie’ performed her last duties in Malowen Lowarth Cottage in Paxton Square last Sunday 31 October.  Over the years her portrayal of a Cornish woman on the 1870s has earned much acclaim.  When the cottages were restored as part of the State’s J150 celebrations, one of them was given to the National Trust to be furnished c. 1870.  A group led by Colin Fidock did a great job at creating a cottage museum complete with dirt or red brick floors.  The cottage opened on 12 October 1985.  On 5 July 1987 Marj took over in her role as Cousin Marjorie and her performance often included cooking over the open fire in the kitchen.  The back garden was planted out as a c. 1870 cottage garden with herbs, flowers and vegetables, to make Malowen Lowarth (Cornish for Hollyhock Cottage) a unique tourist attraction.  Last week Marj gave her final appearance after 17 years.  Tressna Martin and Dilys Bull will now present the cottage to visitors.  Prior to taking over the cottage Marj looked after Redruth Gaol and the Courthouse in a 25 year period of service to the National Trust.  [Photo]
