Advt.  Mrs Taylor of Paxton Terrace, Burra says:

‘My son always praises Doan’s Ointment because it cured him of piles.  He suffered from itching and protruding piles . . . He used Doan’s Ointment and it gave him good relief . . . We got this ointment at Wilkinson’s Pharmacy.’

On 22 October 1907 Mrs Taylor says:

‘My son is still free of itching and protruding piles, and has been quite free of this complaint ever since Doan’s Ointment cured him, eight years ago.’
