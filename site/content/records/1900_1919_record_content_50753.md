Violet Day was held on 7 July and was very successful even if not as big an effort as last year.  Christmas cheer was again collected and sent off through the League of Loyal Women.  400 Christmas puddings were despatched and cigarettes for 400 men in the navy.  Well-packed Christmas boxes were sent to 50 nurses in Egypt.  Mr F. Harris got 250 Christmas boxes from the League of Loyal Women and these were speedily bought and packed by people.  Parcels were sent to two prisoners of war, but we donâ€™t know if they arrived.  In January we appealed for khaki handkerchiefs and 2,250 were handed in.
