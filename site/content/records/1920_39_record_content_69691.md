RSL held its AGM last Saturday in the club rooms.  President Stanley Hawker took the chair.  City guests were Mr C.A.S. Hawker MHR and Mr Hugh Whitford.  An appeal from the League Headquarters was made with respect to the Distressed Sailors & Soldiers’ Fund.  A subscription list will be opened.  It was resolved to seek a lease of the rooms in the Eastern Telephone Building.  Due to the long absence overseas of the President the annual report was given by the Vice-President D. Keynes.

The Anzac Sports were a great success, followed by a fine dinner and dance in the Aberdeen Lodge Hall.  The Anzac Service was well attended and Comrade Murison’s return for it was appreciated.  The collection went to the Cemetery Fund.  There was also a church parade for returned soldiers at Kooringa Methodist Church and a parade of returned soldiers for the Coronation Service at the Institute.  A fancy dress football match also went off well.  Armistice Day was duly observed.  Elected for 1938: President, S. Hawker; Vice-Presidents, D. Keynes & S.C. Genders.  Hon Secretary, H. Fuss & Treasurer, M.T. Fuller.
