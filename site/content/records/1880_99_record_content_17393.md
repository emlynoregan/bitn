Kooringa-Aberdeen Footway.  Council has accepted tenders in 12 chain sections for this very necessary work from Kooringa to the Mine Bridge.  The footway will be cut on the upper [west] side of the road and the material cut away placed on the lower [east] side to form a footway there too.  Council will try to get an extra 15 feet along the lower side to form an avenue which, when planted, would make a pleasant promenade in future.  The estimated cost of the work let is Â£150.
