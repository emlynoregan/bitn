‘The larrikins mustered well here on Monday night.  Mob rule was nearly in vogue here last week.  Five –pound notes flew about very freely on Monday night here.  Several of the Burra youths worked harder on Monday than for some time previously.’

Mr Symon, ‘What? Do you say that?  You have been mud slinging for the last eighteen months and you have the effrontery to come into court with a libel action.  (Cheers)’

Symon then raised an article in the Jamestown Review, ‘ABOUT New’s (?) PAPERS’.

[This article sarcastically refers to the way the leaders of newspapers (not the Record) are put together by a few lines of introduction followed by column inched of matter cut from Hansard etc. but it doesn’t matter the editor (not the Record) produces a two column article in ten minutes by such means ____ as long as they have a strong thumb that can stand the demand made by the scissors, ‘because nobody will read it anyhow’.  This article was printed shortly after Davey had taken over the Record from Murrie.]

Hardy denied that this was intended to ridicule Davey’s capacity for writing leaders.

‘No I didn’t know he wrote the leaders.’

Symons, ‘Did you do it for the purpose of making people laugh at the way the Record was got up?

Hardy, ‘I didn’t see anything to laugh at.’

Symons then raised an article in the Jamestown Review of 2 March 1892 which again raised Mr Shortridge’s comments on the Council election, at a presentation.

Mr Symon, ‘There is not much in anything you write except abuse, and yet you are the gentleman who wants damages for libel.  Did you call the paper a “cad of a newspaper”?’

Hardy, ‘Yes and I would do so again.’

Symon, ‘Did not Lake tell you he had to apologise to Davey for these attacks of yours?’

Hardy, ‘No.’

Symon, ‘You saw in the Record that they apologised?’

Hardy, ‘Yes’

The apologies from the owner of the Jamestown Review, G. Hingston Lake, and the editor, C.J. Reade, are then printed.
