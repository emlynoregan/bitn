A few weeks ago W. Davies of Burra noticed some remains of an unknown animal protruding from the bank of a deep creek, tributary to Baldina Creek on the Eastern Plains.  He returned a few days later with Messrs Nevin & [C.] Fuss.  They managed to retrieve only a few bones due to the unsafe nature of the bank.  Mr H.S. Rumball was in the town and he took the recovered bones to Mr Zeits at the Adelaide Museum.  He identified them as those of a diprotodon.  Mr Zeits and Mr Rumball arrived on 21 December and a party set of for the site of the discovery.  About 10 tons of earth had to be removed in order to extricate the remaining bones.  There comprised only the head of the animal, as the stream had washed away the rest of it.  Unfortunately in moving the head, it broke into four pieces, but none was lost.  The specimen is 2’10” long and two lower incisor teeth were 9” in length and those on the top were over 1’ long and curved over the lower ones like tusks.  In the evening a number of people viewed the specimen in Mr Fuss’s shop in Aberdeen before Mr Zeits took it to Adelaide for the Museum.
