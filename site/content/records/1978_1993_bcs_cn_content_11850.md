Burra Arts Council.

In October 1986 the Burra arts Council in conjunction with Flinders University and the Burra National Trust will present an event at Redruth Gaol.  Based on the gaol and reformatory periods, it will seek to enact and show aspects of the social life of Burra using lights, music and other effects.  The core performers will be Year 3 Drama Students from Flinders University.  Several students would like to meet Burra people who have stories about women of this period or later.  Another is interested in the role of the church in the reformatory and town.  Another is interested in folk music and song of the early days, while yet another has a focus on recreation, games and education of young people.  If you can help, please contact the Arts Council.  The students will be in Burra as follows:

December 2-6 – women in the reformatory period

January 6-10 & perhaps 17 – the role of the church

January 20-24 – music & folklore

Recreation, games and education is yet to be arranged.
