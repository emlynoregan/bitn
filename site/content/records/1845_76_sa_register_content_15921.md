The SA Mining Association: The Burra Burra Mines [Editorial]

The half-yearly meeting of the SA Mining Association took place in the offices of the company in Adelaide on Wednesday 15 October.  The Directors reported that the ore raised in the past half year was 4,429 tons with an estimated 22% copper content.  This had been taken from workings not below 55 fathoms; the workings having been limited to that depth for economic reasons.  From 30 September 1861 to 31 March 1862 ore raised was 4,959 tons at a cost of £48,637-3-6 or £9-16-2 per ton.  It realised £59,210-16-10 or £11-18-10 per ton, leaving a profit of £10,573-13-4 or £2-2-8.  This is 5/3 per ton more than was realised in the previous half year, despite a fall in the price of copper.  The total profit for the mine for the last half-year including rents and fees was £11,848-11-6.  The credit balance in the company’s profit and loss account to 31 March 1862 is £11,598-13-3.  To this may be added the estimated profit yet to be realised on ore raised in the past six months, which is £9,223-14-7, bringing the total balance of profit to £20,822-7-10 available for division among the shareholders.  Directors intend to pay a dividend of £5 per share on 18 October, which will be the 50th dividend.

The reasons for suspending work below 55 fathoms have been cited as the low price of copper and the shortage of labour due to competition.  This decision saved the cost of working one large pumping engine and of prosecuting much of the tutwork.  Ore on hand at the mine on 30 September was 3,217 tons and there were also between 5 and 6 tons of refined copper on hand.

The Karkulto Mine is still being worked by tributers and is almost paying expenses.

Mr Thomas Waterhouse, who has just returned to the colony, was appointed to the Board in place of Mr J.C. Boord, who had resigned preparatory to his departure for England.

At an extraordinary general meeting that followed the ordinary meeting the Directors were given permission to dispose of their mineral lands not presently in use.

We are sure that our readers will be gratified, with ourselves, at the continued prosperity of the Burra Burra Mines.
