Swimming Classes.  On Saturday morning the Burra Gymnasium Club added to their exercises a swimming class at the Mine Pool.  Mr A.J. McBride has given use of the pool and timber for rafts and dressing sheds to be erected there.  Mr Foote addressed the boys and sought assurance of parental consent before proceeding.  Messrs Adey, Jackson & Oborn would be the instructors.  A busy bee will be held next Saturday for the erection of diving boards.  The pool gives a swimming area 175yds x 50yds.  There is a raft on the water capable of carrying six persons.
