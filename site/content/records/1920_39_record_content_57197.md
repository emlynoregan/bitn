Burra Burra Show Inc.  With the Centenary of the state approaching together with the silver jubilee of his presidency, the president of the Society, Mr I.J. Warnes, some time ago offered to donate £250 if a matching sum were collected.  The greater part of that sum is in hand and Mr Warnes has forwarded his cheque for £250.  He suggested that a suitable centenary year project would be the building of a brick Centenary Hall on the showgrounds.  A meeting of the society on 27 July accepted his cheque and resolved to build a brick hall and convert one of the present iron buildings to a sheep shed.  A letter will be sent to Sir George Ritchie asking for his support.  Arrangements to proceed were made.
