Soldiers’ Aid Society, AGM in Jubilee Hall Redruth.  M.A. Radford presiding.

The small band of workers was determined to continue to support the many returned men lying maimed and injured in hospitals.  The President, Mrs E. Bertram, read the 5th Annual Report.  Attendance at meetings has averaged 20-25.  Three members died during the year: Mesdames Bentley, Bailey and Montgomery.  In September 1919 the society provided lunch at the Sheep Dog Trials and the £20 so raised went to the RSL and lunch at the 1919 Burra Show raised £120-4-10, which allowed the society to send £103-12-0 to the Red Cross Produce Dept., which kept that enterprise afloat when it was on the point of closure.  In April we decided to send £20 per month for five months to this cause.  In all over 15 months £203-12-0 has been sent.  Money has also been donated to Minda Home (£20), the Army Nurses Fund (£20) and to the Burra & District Soldiers’ Memorial Fund (£25).  On August 14 we provided the Annual Dinner to returned soldiers.  About 72 were present.

The Treasurer’s report is printed.
