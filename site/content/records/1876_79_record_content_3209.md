Water supply. Ed. Up to 5 Dec. there had been no government response. The matter was growing serious. Many residents have wells [which seems to contradict statements at the meeting] and except for stock purposes consumption would not warrant additional expense and therefore a trough in the reserve behind Preece's is all that is essential. £150 would solve all essential needs.

In Kooringa the creek supply is also dwindling, but water is more easily obtainable there from the spring near the wool washery. As this point is higher than Market Square no artificial means are needed to raise the water; just a main to a convenient public trough. Expenditure of perhaps £300, half from public subscription and the rest a government subsidy if the Corporation takes the matter up.
