Burra Yacht Club’s Fun Night on the banks of the creek in January grossed $480, of which $160 was paid out in prizes.  Over the past twelve months the Yacht Club has given $350 to the Lions Club to assist the Senior Citizens Bus Service.  There are plans to extend the creek playground and beautification scheme.  A further 100 Wheelbarrow Push T-shirts have been produced – 50 have been pre-ordered.
