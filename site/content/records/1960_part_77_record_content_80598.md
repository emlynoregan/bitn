The Burra Show [Incorrectly cited as the 99th.]

The day dawned frosty and remained fine, but became intensely cold as the day progressed.  A fair crowd attended.  The gate amounted to $615.  There were record entries for horse in action.  Michelle Burton was Miss Show Girl and A. Talent won the open shearing contest.  Show President Mr Ron Shipard welcomed guests and thanked exhibitors and all those who worked so hard to put the show on.

Mr Ray McCallum, President of the Northern Show Societies, from Orroroo opened the show.

Junior Miss Show Girl was Mary-Anne Shipard.

Sub-Junior Miss Show Girl was Carolyn Armstrong of Burra.

In the open shearing contest L. Hughes and A. Talent both scored 187 points and there was a shear-off to decide the winner, with Arthur Talent coming out on top.  The judges were Tony Ryan and Graham Heine.

Greg Germein won the Novice Section.

Art entries were of a very high standard.

Budgerigars were of a good standard with some excellent young birds.

Pigeons were a big improvement on last year’s display.

Poultry were well staged, but the number of shows held on the same day made it hard to get a large show of top birds.

Children’s pets were well displayed and covered a wide range from a goat to a white mouse.

Cattle had some good heifers, but generally carried less condition than in 1975.

Cooking was of a good standard with notably good cheesecake, boiled fruit cake and chocolate cake entries.

Junior entries were impressive.

Flowers were down a bit due to the season, but there was a fair display and some very good blooms.

Floral Art was good, with outstanding entries under ‘Á Song Title’.  The children’s section was a pleasure to judge.
