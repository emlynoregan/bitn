Notice.  [Rev.] Clem Christopher advises that some agents of the Seventh Day Adventists are selling a book in the town called Desire of the Ages.  They present a list of commendations, one of which is from Rev. C. Christopher.  He revokes that ‘commendation’ absolutely and advises all Methodists not to purchase the said book.
