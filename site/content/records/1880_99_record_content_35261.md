Fire at Mt Bryan.  The fire started on the property of William Cockrum, sheep farmer of Mt Bryan and it is generally supposed its origin was the midday passenger train from Adelaide.  The flames spread rapidly in grass and were soon out of control.  The grass at the start was very thick and fire soon engulfed the whole paddock.  It soon threatened Mr Cockrum’s house and consumed all about it such as a large haystack, a lot of machinery including horseworks for a chaffcutter, a small engine etc.  A small forest around the place burnt, but then the wind veered to the southwest and the flames ran away from the house which was saved.  It burnt another well-grassed paddock, despite the dozens of willing helpers.  It now entered Mr Griffith Harry’s property consuming two sections of grass and made for the big range of hills to the west, at the top of which it had a width of about two miles and was moving fast.  To the north it burnt a gap through Mr G. Hiles' paddocks, but his house escaped as the wind on that side of the range chopped and the flames spread on towards Booborowie, burning for miles unchecked.  Miraculously all the houses en route were saved.  It travelled some 8-9 miles on a two mile front.
