The Burra Waterworks lease expires at the end of the present year.  The Council currently pays about £403 p.a. being 5% on the capital cost of £8,072.  The Council decided to find out the Government’s terms for:

The purchase of the Waterworks by the Council, funded by a loan from the State Bank.

The arrangement of a new lease.

The throwing up of the Waterworks to the Government.

An early reply is requested so the Council can discuss the matter before laying it before ratepayers.

The request was laid before the Treasurer (F.W. Holder) with a view of considerable concessions being made.

The Treasurer said he and another member of the Federal Convention would visit the town and would address electors on the subject.
