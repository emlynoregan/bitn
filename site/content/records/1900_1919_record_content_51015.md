YMCA Army Dept.  Burra Branch was formed on 14 June at a meeting in the Council Chamber where Capt. Shoebridge explained the work of the Department and sought to stimulate interest in the formation of a local branch committee.  The YMCA provided secretaries and equipment on each troop ship and provided stationery etc. at the front and elsewhere.  They organised trips and entertainment at places en route like Colombo and sold items to the boys to add to their comfort, which had cut the cost to the men by 50%.  A committee was formed comprising: E.W. Crewes, P. Milner, G. Lawn, J. Drew, N.G. Burns, F. Harris, G. Horner, Rev. A.J. Finch, Mr James, G. Dane, H.H. Thomas and E.J. Harris.
