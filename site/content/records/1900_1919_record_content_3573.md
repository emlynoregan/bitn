‘Peace Day’.  Next Monday children from the various schools will gather at Market Square at 9 a.m. to form a procession to Victoria Park for refreshments and games with the costs to be borne by the ‘Peace Day’ funds since that idea has fallen through. [As had the Peace!’]  Mr Frank Harris will cater and he is busy preparing over 700 bags of lollies etc.
