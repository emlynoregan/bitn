Burra Golf Club has secured approval from Goyder Council for $170,000 towards greening its tees, fairways and greens and for associated course upgrades.  The sum is subject to a further grant of $150,000 being received for the club to enable the $320,000 project to go ahead.  The club has to provide guarantors for $100,000.  The Council will subsidise the loan to the tune of $10,000 p.a. for the first five years, after which the club becomes fully responsible for all repayments.  The club applied for a grant of $150,000 from the Department of Sports and recreation in February this year and the success of their application will be known at the end of this month.  The Councilâ€™s offer remains open for 12 months.
