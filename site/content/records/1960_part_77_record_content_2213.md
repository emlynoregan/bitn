Burra Town Council, 2 May

Tenders were received from E.J. Lehmann and Hirschausen Bros for the fortnightly collection of garbage.

Consideration was held over until figures are available for scavenging by Council employees.

The Health Officer reported on Paxton Square.  All but 3 or 4 homes were inspected.  All were structurally sound, but the single complaint was the lack of bathing or washing facilities.  Sanitary conditions were in accordance with the tenants themselves.

The owner of a cottage in Hill Street is to be served notice concerning white ant damage and leaking ceilings.

After efforts to recover same it was decided to write off Â£32-15-0 in outstanding cemetery fees.

Owners of the Burra Hotel were granted permission to remove trees in front of the building and to replant with candle pines.

The hire of the Town Hall was granted for badminton on Monday and Thursday nights.
