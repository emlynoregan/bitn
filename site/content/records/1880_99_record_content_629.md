Editorial on the Water Supply. [Runs into page 3.]

After discussions somewhat more than 12 months ago a water supply was arranged for teams at Aberdeen, and for those who required it - on the principle that the users would pay and the cost would not be met by a general rate.  In Kooringa a well has been begun in Market Square, which will provide a public trough, and a public pump.  The whole idea has been to avoid a general town water rate.  Some residents at Aberdeen and Redruth have applied for the scheme there to be extended.  The response of the Commissioner of Public Works has been a proposal for a general scheme for the whole town, which would be met by a general rate.  The cost of the whole is set down at c. £10,000.

If this is correct then with running costs of c. £250 p.a. plus 5% on the initial £10,000 outlay would mean that £750 p.a. would have to be raised by the rates.  If spread over the whole town this would equal the current general rate plus the health rate, i.e. 1/3 in the £.

If only those properties adjacent to the main were rated they would pay 3/6 in the £.  This would not suit either those with adequate well and/or tank supplies, or many businessmen in the town.  Residents of Kooringa will not tolerate this.  We support the extension asked for on the basis that users only pay.
