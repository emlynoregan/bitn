Burra Burra DC will support the School Council for the retention of a double transportable building after the new school is completed, as a home for the Youth Club.  A site at the Memorial Oval would be made available if the building could be retained.

Maintenance work will be done on the Town Hall and the front retaining wall.  Information will be sought from the Dean of the Adelaide University on what action could be taken to obtain a resident dentist for Burra.
