Burra Town Council, 2 September

Council held a mark of respect for the late E.W. Crewes and a letter of sympathy was sent to the family.

There was a prolonged debate about removal and/or the lopping of various trees in town streets.

The Aero Club wrote to say an air service is contemplated between Adelaide and Broken Hill and Burra was a likely landing place.

The Finance Committee recommends getting advice about the old ambulance and of its being turned into a runabout.
