The Phosphate Fields.  No work is currently going on.  F.A.S. Field has sent away a 5-ton sample that has assayed to 70%.  Work is halted pending a decision from BHP on erecting suitable processing machinery at Pt Pirie.  The cost of cartage to Adelaide is prohibitive.

The sample of rock sent away by E.N. Finch & Sons was satisfactory and they also hold an area of richer material.
