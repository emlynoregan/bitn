Court.

26 December.  Stanley Lines, aged 20 was sentenced to 1 month in Adelaide Gaol for stealing a pair of shoes valued at 6/11 from Philip Phyliss, the ‘boots’ at the Burra Hotel.

28 December.  Thomas Byrnes was charged with using indecent language in Market Square on Christmas Eve.  He failed to appear.  M-C Jemison said he was at Boolcoomatta Station and a warrant for his arrest would cost him his job to the disadvantage of his wife and family.  He asked for the case to be heard ex parte and the bench agreed.  The fine was £1-12-0 with court fees of 15/- and witness fee of 7/- for a total of £1-12-0.  [This doesn’t make sense so either the total was £2-14-0 or the original fine was 10/- and the total as stated.  A month was allowed to pay or 1 month in jail.]
