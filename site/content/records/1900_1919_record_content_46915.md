Isabella Halls:

Before 9 April had been allowed £2 per week, but he then told me the two boys could keep me.  Have been married 32 years.  On 18 April said he would ‘make an Alf. Lyons [sic] job of the whole lot of you’.  [This is a reference to Alfred Lines, who in June 1885 shot his wife and her lover before shooting himself.]  Have seen him in the company of the women above and heard him with others unknown.  Am afraid he might shoot me.  About five weeks ago saw his bankbook – he had about £700 in the bank.  The house I live in is my own.  Would accept 30/- a week.  Four children from the marriage are still alive: the youngest is 19.  Defendant lives in another house, but comes to mine for dinner and tea.  He had been in mental hospital for six months.
