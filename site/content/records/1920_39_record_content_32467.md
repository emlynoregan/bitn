Weather.  Rain set in on Saturday last and extended to the east.  Falls of over 2 inches were recoded though it was patchy and falls reported varied from 30 points to 267.  The watercourse that starts near Yunta came down through Sturt vale half a mile wide in places – the first time it has flowed since 1921.  Over 1 inch fell at World’s End.  Feed will come on well for many pastoralists and dams have filled.  Gardens will benefit and it is thought that wheat will not be damaged unless excessive heat follows.
