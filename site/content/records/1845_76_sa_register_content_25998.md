The Mt Bryan Road

A special meeting of the central Road Board was held on Tuesday to consider the steps needed to place the Mt Bryan Road in repair, following the recent deputation.  The Chairman pointed out that the Commissioner of Public Works was unable to act because the road was on the schedule of main roads with control vested in the Board.  The only funds readily available were £750 from the contingent fund.  The work was urgent with holes in the road large enough to take a dray in bodily.  The condition of the road was holding up the shipment of 12,000 bales of wool, many tons of which had been thrown off drays and exposed to the weather.  2,000 or 3,000 tons of merchandise were also delayed going north from Burra.  After discussion it was decided to spend the £750 in the contingent fund and to point out to the Government that they would then have no funds to cover any contingency that might arise.  Mr Bright, the Commissioner for Public Works thanked the Board for its prompt action and undertook to consider carefully any request for funds should a contingency arise, being sure they would not ask for such unless it was absolutely necessary.
