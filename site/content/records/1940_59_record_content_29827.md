Obituary.  Mrs Wilhelmina Matilda Klaffus died at Burra Hospital last Wednesday, 8 January, aged 100 years and 4½ months.  She was born at Hahndorf SA 27 August 1846 and was the daughter of a schoolteacher.  She married first the late Carl Frahm and the couple resided at Light’s Pass.  There were eight children of the marriage, one of whom survives in the person of Mr Oscar Frahm of Gilles Plains.  Mr Frahm died in November 1886 and in 1889 the deceased married Mr Charles Klaffus.  The couple moved to World’s End and farmed there for about five years.  In this time she helped her husband clear the land, cut wood and load wagons.  They were among the first settlers in the district.  There was one child of this marriage: Walter Klaffus who lives in Earlwood, NSW.  She came to live in Burra 52 years ago and over many years was employed in many families in town with regard to domestic duties.  She did not take an active interest in the social life of the town, but was a strong adherent of the Lutheran Church.  She could see and hear well until very recently.  Some years ago she was awarded the Brodie Chair for being the oldest living mother of a son who had served in the 1914-18 war (Walter Klaffus).  Her birthday as she neared the century was celebrated with due ceremony and her party last August for her 100th birthday was quite a big event.  The Mayor Mr H. Jennison and members of the Burra Ministers’ Fraternal attended.  Last year the PM visited her when he was in Burra and she insisted he sit in the Brodie Chair.  She did her own shopping till four years ago.  For 22 years she lived alone with Mrs E. Wohling coming in daily and attending to her meals.  She was well until 22 December when she fell over in her back yard and though she made light of it she went to hospital where she eventually died.

[Born Wilhelmina Mathilda Seelander 27 August 1846 at Hahndorf: died 7 January 1947 at Burra.]
