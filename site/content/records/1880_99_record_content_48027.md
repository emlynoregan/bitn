Burra High School speech day on Wednesday last was held in the Institute with a smaller attendance than the quality of the program deserved.  Students presented Mrs McLagan with a clock and Miss Sprod with a silver table napkin ring.  The list of prize-winners is printed.

[The surnames indicate students from the more affluent part of the community: McBride, Roach, Sangster, Packard, Brummitt, Watt, Lewis.  May Dawson was dux of the School.]
