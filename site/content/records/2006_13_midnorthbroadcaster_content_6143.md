Burra History Group

Meredith Satchell lived in Burra to the age of 13 and it was not until she returned to the town in 2001 that her obsession with the town’s history grew.  Her chance meeting with Eric Fuss resulted in endless hours of joint effort on town and family history.  Meredith started a small website, which soon attracted questions from people with family connections to Burra and the district.  One such enquiry came from Rosemary Ros, now living in North Carolina.  She wanted some information on the Pearce Family of Pearce’s Building in Commercial Street.  She was so grateful for the help received that she offered to set up a new website for The Burra History Group.  This now provides information on a broad range of topics and is an invaluable research tool, especially for those living interstate or overseas.  Eric Fuss has been summarising every copy of the Burra Record from 1876 to 1976 [actually 1977].  So far the years 1876-1956 have been noted [except for a few years for which the hard copy is missing] and the years 1876-1940 have been published on a CD – equivalent to some 5,000 A4 pages.  The Burra History Group appreciates any photo or document from the past so that it can be preserved digitally.  Meredith is currently collecting photographs on Burra’s servicemen and women.  Since 2005 the Burra History Group has maintained an extensive display of historical photographs in the refurbished Burra Town Hall and this is open free to the public.  In 2007 with a grant from the Goyder Council they purchased a computer to aid family history research and to store all relevant records/documents and photographs they could find.  The group strives to preserve Burra’s history for generations to come.  [Photos of Meredith.]
