‘D’ writes concerning the Burra Mine:

The proposed changes to the constitution of the SA Mining Association might seem to be of concern only to its shareholders, but the business of the company has spread itself all over the colony and has given colonists generally an interest in the proceedings of the company.  To speculate upon the consequences of transferring the property of the Burra Mine to an English company may seem premature, but there are dangers in such a proposal, which could affect all the copper mining companies in Australia.

In Britain there is a gigantic monopoly of the smelting trade and if they could gain control of this property, which has been one of the richest in the world, and then strike an arrangement with the principal proprietors of the Burra and Wallaroo Smelting Works it is doubtful if anything like a permanent development of its treasures would be attempted.  It would be worked or kept idle as best suited their interests and the loss of trade to the colony would be immense.

The suggestion which the report of the Directors makes to place the new scheme into the English Market and to have the company registered there is not calculated to limit these dangers as outlined.

The arrangement must give the Wallaroo mining and smelting company a monopoly of the Indian and Eastern markets to the practical exclusion of the smaller properties unless through them.  The erection of the large smelting works on Yorke’s Peninsula was intended as a protection against the smelting monopoly in England.

If the owners of these works can by amalgamating their interests with the English smelting monopoly and add to their large possession the Burra Mine, the Australian copper trade will be at their mercy.

‘Out of the enormous dividends the mine has returned, common prudence would have made a reserve fund sufficient to carry the concern over a loss such as the Directors show, even if it were repeated for a few years in succession.’
