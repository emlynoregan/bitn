Adelaide-Burra Road Race Classic

The cyclists are expected in Burra at about 3 p.m. after travelling via Gawler, Greenock, Kapunda and Black Springs on a course of about 90 miles.  Leading professionals have nominated for the event.

[Details in ⅔ column, but strangely the race gets no follow-up coverage after it happened – presuming it did happen!]
