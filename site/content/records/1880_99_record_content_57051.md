Cr Rabbich charged that Inspector J.R. Gray had ‘told a ratepayer that Cr Hardy and himself [Cr Rabbich] supported the acceptance of the lowest tender for carting gravel and he was surprised at the ratepayers supporting such men.’*

The accused said he was prepared to tell the truth at the proper time.

Town Council and the District Council will meet to inspect the disputed point about the fencing of the new stock road.

Launder & Co.’s tender of £9 per chain for building a wall against a footpath in East Ward was accepted. (D. Rogers had tendered £6.)

Launder & Co.’s tender of £2-5-0 per chain for kerbing was also accepted ahead of D. Roger’s of £1-19-0.

* This may seem to be an unexceptional comment, but probably the implication was that the North Ward Councillors were in favour of accepting a lower tender if it came from another Ward whereas North Ward ratepayers would expect the tender to go to a local man, even if it cost somewhat more.  There had been some debate over this in the past.
