The Salvation Army opened their new barracks in Burra yesterday.  The corps marched to the railway station to meet the first Adelaide train and Major Thurman, Staff-Captain Oldham, Staff-Captain Hendy, Lieutenant Ward, and others.  The whole then marched back to Kooringa, band playing and colours flying.  An open-air service followed at the pump and then tea in the new barracks.  The hall was crowded to capacity in the evening.  Staff-Captain Hendy opened the meeting.  The Wesleyans had given them the land and the cost from Messrs Sara and Dunstan had been £582-0-9 and the present debt was £437, but seats and other conveniences would increase that to £500.  The building in Kingston Street is large and substantial, if plain.  The room is 60’ x 45’ x 18’ high.  Acoustic properties seem good and ventilation is sufficient.  The doors need attention.  In the event of fire there are three doors and the hall could be emptied quickly, but they slide and in a panic with pressure against them they would be immovable.
