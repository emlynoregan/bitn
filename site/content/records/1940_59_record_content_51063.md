Badminton

RSL 11-192 defeated Kooringa Red 1-64

Burra North Blue 7-190 defeated Burra North Gold 5-156

The 5th Choral Society Concert at the Burra Town Hall on 29 June drew only a small attendance despite presenting a program of high standard and having some of Adelaideâ€™s best as visiting artists.  The program was well presented within the limitations imposed by numbers and the soloists were excellent.  The small attendance is discouraging and it would be a pity if lack of patronage limits such visits and occasions.
