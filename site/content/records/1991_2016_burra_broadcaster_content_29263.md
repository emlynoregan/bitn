Richard and Jan Riggs went out to Murkaby last Tuesday 22 October to draft sheep.  Richard said it was the worst day he had experienced with gale force winds all day until 3 p.m. when a change arrived.  He was at that time taking a flock of ewes back to the paddock and they were just five metres in front of him when they completely vanished in raised dust.  He waited in a gateway for the dust to subside a little.  Nearby there was a dam which he did not want them to go to, but where he expected to find them, but when conditions eased slightly they had not moved during the squall and were still five metres ahead of him.

Later in the afternoon he went to clean out a trough, but had to abandon the idea because of the quantity of dust and stones being hurled about in the wind.  The next day when he returned the trough was so full of dirt that the float was unable to drop down to admit the water. It made him recall the 1967 drought when he was lamb marking and could not seek Brian Woodman who was working on the other side of the fence from him.  There are also masses of emus out there, from Baldina to Murkaby.
