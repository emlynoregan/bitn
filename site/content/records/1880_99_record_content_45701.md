The small graziers’ interests, he thought, would not be served by the tax and they should unite with the general body of taxpayers.  2nd F. Carey.

J.M. McBride then challenged the previous speakers.  With the influx of stock from Queensland local graziers were lucky to sell any stock.  He then got stuck into the butchers who bought fat cattle at 5/- per cwt and 45 lb sheep at ½d per lb.  16 or 20 years ago the price of cattle was £15 per head and meat was the same price as now.

Mr Riggs then said that since Victoria had imposed a tax SA had to react and 3/- a sheep was a fair thing to protect small graziers and farmers.  He denied the earlier meeting had been timed to avoid the workingman being present. He was however prepared to wait for the resolution of the matter at the next election.

P.L. Killicoat said the other meeting was timed to allow country people a chance to return home in good time.

The motion was put and carried.

Cr Linkson moved that the outcome of the meeting be forwarded to the district MPs for presentation to Parliament.  2nd Cr Hardy and carried.
