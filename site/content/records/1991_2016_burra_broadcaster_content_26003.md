Redruth Camp Centre

Operations are currently being reviewed.  In 2000 the Centre, comprising the former Redruth Methodist Church and Sunday School and the former Courthouse Hotel, had some 2,300 bed nights occupied.  Operation of the Centre devolved from the synod to the local parish in 1995.  Manager Helen McColl has done a great job in that time.  Over the past few years it has needed injections of funds from the Op Shop.  A committee set up to examine operations has made the preliminary recommendation that it cease to operate at the end of 2001 and that the buildings then be sold.  A community meeting to consider this has been called for 24 September in the Burra Uniting Church Hall.  Among other considerations is the fact that there is a declining number of camps.  In the first half of 2001 the number of camps was down by seven and the long term trend is downwards.  The cause of such a decline is not clear, but factors could include:

The site is now split by a busier road.

The cost of bus transport to Burra has risen.

Fewer schools are holding camps due to increasing legal obligations and perhaps the ageing of the teaching force.

In any case the loss for 2000-01 is considerable.

Maintenance in recent years has been minimal and considerable costs need to be met there in the future.

The buildings are heritage items and so there are no simple solutions.

The decision will be made by the Church Council â€“ possibly in October.
