The Burra Mine Site Trail will be launched at the Friends of the Park Forum in October.  A full colour brochure has been created showing the extent of the grasslands in the Mid North.  The trail, which is virtually in the centre of the town of Burra, takes people through the grassland where native grasses and small bushes will be name plated.  The walk is at its best in late spring and early summer, when the plants are likely to be flowering.  More than 120 species of native plants, of which 37 are listed as rare or endangered species, are protected here.  The tour and launch will be held on 23 October.
