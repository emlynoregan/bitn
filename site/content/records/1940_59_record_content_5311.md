‘Veritas Odium Parit’ writes on the Sunday Observance controversy.

‘Let us clear our minds of Cant and face Truth.  The so-called desecration of Sunday is not due to the failing of any particular clergyman in any particular church, but is due, wholly to the fact that the vast majority of thinking men and women have no longer any belief in its sanctity.  To put it bluntly we have lost faith in the clergy.  They take our money and make us all sorts of promises, but they don’t deliver the goods.’

[The writes then at some length draws attention to the bloodbath of the war and asks on behalf of the thousands being killed: ‘Was their church-going any good to them?’  And so on.]

‘The theological notions handed out to us by so many of the clergy today are as contrary to reason and as devoid of truth as the mutterings of a numbo-jumbo [sic], prostrating himself before his painted idol in the depths of an African forest.’

The writer ends by asserting there is a conspiracy of silence on this loss of faith because the tradesmen won’t speak out for fear of losing trade and the professional men are equally fearful of being boycotted.  For this reason then he signs himself with the Latin proverb: ‘Truth begets hatred.’
