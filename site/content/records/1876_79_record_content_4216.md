Water Supply. A hydraulic engineer has visited us and levels have been taken and it is, we hear, the intention of the Govt. to bring a supply of good water to our doors. We hope soon to hear of a good practicable scheme being approved. Much of the water now being used in the Burra [note the editor’s use of the definite article here in contrast to the previous editor’s practice] is impure and that from wells is very hard. The majority of water in wells in town even where there is good drainage has organic impurities. In Burra no drainage system is known. Water in covered tanks is less contaminated, but foreign matter does still enter. A water supply will save much labour and remove the need for the excessive economy exercised with it now in many parts of the town. Hydrants may be connected for use in fire fighting. Persons don’t plant trees because they cannot afford to water them for the first year or two. Water for gardens cannot be spared. Sanitary authorities suggest it will lead to better health and lower mortality.
