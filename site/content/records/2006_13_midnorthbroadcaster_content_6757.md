Eudunda’s Goyder Sports & Community Centre

The Council voted last week to allow the $8.8 million centre to proceed to the next stage.  Funding would come from the sale of the current bowling club and community land, open space funding, AFL funding, loans, community fundraising and state and federal grants.  A federal grant of $2.5 million will be sought.

Mayor Mattey warned that a shortfall in funding could see Eudunda rates rise by up to 25%.  The progress of the project would now depend on the procuring of grants.  Cr Pfitzner said every sporting club supported the move.  Council has approved the erection of the project on Council owned land.  Council loans of up to $2.5 million are part of the project.  [Plans are printed.]

The Goyder Ratepayers’ Action Group is opposed – seeing a huge increase in the cost of servicing Council debts – Eudunda Ward alone could face $224,000 p.a.  The group wants a public meeting to consider the matter.
