Weather.  With 23.2 mm to 9 a.m. yesterday and 81.0 mm for the week, the January-May period becomes the wettest on record; 508.6 mm or 20.02 inches.  The previous highest was in 1889 with 13.41 inches.  The continuously flowing water courses and flooding have made access to many paddocks virtually impossible.  Many gutters have become creeks and shallow creeks have been deepened.

The Burra Creek yesterday was a rushing torrent of muddy water for the sixth time this year.  Mt Bryan was flooded again on Thursday; the earth is so saturated that it cannot absorb even a slight shower.

Further rain has fallen, with 94 points to 1.30 p.m.

Booborowie received 25 mm in ten minutes at lunch time.

Buildings have been flattened at Eudunda in a cyclonic storm [i.e. a tornado].
