An Anzac Service was held last Sunday near the monument to the fallen in Market Square.  There was a good attendance and an unusually large number of returned men.  Present were the Mayor, members of Council, Rev. S.J.W. Coles (Anglican), Rev. E. Lawson (Methodist) who took charge of the service, and Ensign Shinn (Salvation Army).  The offertory aided the AIF Cemetery Fund by Â£14-17-3.  J.H. Murison played The Last Post & Reveille.
