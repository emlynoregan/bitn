Samantha Snell is interviewed as Artist of the Month.  Sam studied design arts at Tea Tree Gully TAFE and then went on with six months of visual merchandising with Sony Music.  Her paintings feature bright colours and tend to be free flowing, vibrant, surprising, but can also be tranquil, minimalist and thought provoking.  [Photo.]
