Fire.  Old Caroona homestead was destroyed by fire on Sunday afternoon, 6 March.  Over $4,000 was done.  The cause is unknown, but may have been a kerosene refrigerator.  The fire was discovered by new employees who were due to occupy the premises, but not until the building was completely burnt out.  The manager Mr Ian McWaters was at his new homestead three miles away.
