Black Springs – Glendore News, 20 May

Rain has at last come to the relief of farmers and others.

Mr Newlyn, the licensed teacher gave a magic lantern exhibition to children and adults at the new public day school last Saturday.  The various phantasmagoria greatly pleased the children and juveniles for whom it was especially intended.
