Burra Rifle Club held its 37th AGM, which is reported at great length in some 3⅓ columns.

[Those present are listed.]

In the absence of the Captain, Mr J.A. Riggs presided.  He reported on the year’s activities.

Average attendance at the range was 15 and the membership was 45, which was an increase of 5 on 1934.  Two good riflemen had left the district in Stan Truscott (to Waikerie) and M-C G.E. Robinson (to Maitland.)  The Baldina Trophy (Handicap) had been won by K. Dawson from P.W. Hogan.

The closely fought Championship was won by P.W. Hogan and Edgar Pearce had won the Handicap Championship.

In teams shooting they had met Clare and Balaklava and been beaten by the latter at Balaklava, but had turned the tables at the return match.  They had also fired three matches with the Local Light Horse Troop and although victorious each time, the troopers had pressed them hard.

Treasurer Mr Edgar Pearce reported a credit balance of £44-17-6 at the start of the year with a membership of 25.  This year members totalled 28 [which seems strangely at odds with the report above] and after improvements had been made the balance now on hand was £41.

Mr H.J.B. Jennison then spoke and presented trophies.

[This speech and those in reply from trophy winners are all reported at length.]

Winners for group shooting were:

200, 500 & 600 yards	G. Herbert

300, 500 & 600 yards	A.B. Riggs

200, 300 & 700 yards	J.E. Pearce

500, 600 & 700 yards	G. Herbert

Double 800 yards		J.H. Schwier

Mr Jennison commended C.H. Dixon on his enthusiasm in riding a push bike from Farrell’s Flat to each fortnightly match.

Election:

Captain:	H.H. Byles

Vice-Captain	J.A. Riggs

Secretary	N. Villis

Treasurer & Armourer	J.E. Pearce
