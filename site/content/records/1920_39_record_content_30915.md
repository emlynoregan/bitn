Frank Treloar: Looking Back (Continued)

From 1850 wells were sunk along the Gulf Road and the road kept in repair and arrangements improved at the port.  Brick cottages were erected at the smelting area in anticipation of the arrival of skilled workers from England.  The mine was doing well at extracting ore.  Logs for underground timbering were in constant demand.  They wanted them 4’9” x 10” diameter.  Thousands were got at 14/9 per hundred.  Sawyers’ logs were also needed in great number.  Sawn hard wood was obtained from Penwortham, Watervale and Skilly which employed many pit sawyers.  Poles came from stringybark beyond Watervale and from White’s near Mt Remarkable.  Firewood was also needed in vast quantity.  Some 300 tons of hay a year was needed for over 70 horses and had to come from afar – Clare, Watervale and Auburn as well as Gawler.  It was all cut by scythes.  To keep up the supply of candles a chandler set up operations near the slaughterhouse below the cemetery.  SAMA supplied the tallow and wicks and the chandler made, strung and boxed the candles, delivering them to the mine for 1½d per pound.  Tallow was bought from any station around and from Vickery’s Boiling Down Works on property owned today by A.G. Gebhardt.  Some tallow came from Adelaide.  A half a ton of candles were needed weekly.  Once the mine came within three days of closure due to the shortage of candles and on another occasion it had to send spring carts out to meet the teams to get supplies.  In 1851 the first [Legislative] Council was sworn in and in 1852 came the discovery of gold in Victoria.  Virtually all the men left Burra.  Some went overland by bullock dray or on horseback or even walked.  Many took ship to Melbourne.  By mid-1852 work at Burra was virtually stopped.  The Smelting Works bought all the bullocks they could, knowing they would be needed once the rush was over.  Inspector Tolmer was appointed to head the gold escort bringing SA miners’ gold back to Adelaide.  Some men did well, some badly and some of the former wasted their gains.  After some time they began to return.  Many of the careful winners bought land and settled in the Clare-Auburn district.  Others returned to Burra.  In June 1852 Mr G.S. Walters of the Copper Co. returned to England and with him went G.K. Horn to buy mules at Valparaiso, which they had decided to use in their work.  As a result of the excitement it took a while to settle down, but eventually it did so with wages higher, more money in circulation, building blocks more commonly applied for and miners’ cottages sprang up in all directions.
