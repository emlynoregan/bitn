Burra Improvements

A large number of improvements have recently been made at Aberdeen:

A new hotel close to the railway has just been completed and licensed. [Bon Accord Hotel.]

The roof is being put on Mr Roach’s flour mill.

Butterworth’s mill is going ahead fast and the boiler has arrived.

The National Bank has opened a branch and Mr Ridgway is building a new office for it.  [This is the corner portion of the Royal Exchange Hotel in 2012.]

The Bank of Australasia has purchased land and is erecting a branch.

It is rumoured that Mr W.H. Williams will erect a brewery on the corner opposite Mr Tiver’s premises.  [This did not eventuate.]

Changes to the North and North-East

Several loads of wool have arrived at Kooringa from Mt Gipps, Panramatty, Paratoo, etc.  Carriers complain of the shortage of feed and the dryness of the season in the Northeast, but near Burra the season is good and the bad roads are the only drawback.  But a damp season and bad roads is preferable to a dry season and good roads.  A few years ago it was very difficult to get the wool clip to Port Adelaide in anything like proper time.  Now with the railway reaching Burra and with a steam dumping press at the Redruth Station, the whole clip, even from the Barrier Ranges is got down in time to ship for the February sales in London.
