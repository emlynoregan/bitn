David Rogers of Hampton writes concerning Council tenders.  Tenders were called for a dry stone wall in Bridge St and 4½ chains of kerbing in the same street.  I tendered according to specifications for £6.  The other tender was for £7-16-0 or with lime and sand for £9.  This last was accepted.

My tender for kerbing was for £1-19-0 per chain and the other was £2-5-0 per chain, which was also accepted.  The difference on these two small jobs was £4-7-0.  This is very unfair between Council and the ratepayers.  I have tendered for work with the Burra Corporation for years and always received fair play until lately and the books will show I have given every satisfaction.  I would ask Councillors to act fair and then no one would complain.
