Burra Swimming Pool

The list of donations stands at Â£387-2-9, but this is less that half the amount needed, so please send your donations as soon as possible.

The Minister of the Army, through the Hon. Sir Philip McBride, has advised that the Drill Hall site would not be made available.

Proceedings can now get under way at the playground site and representations have been made to the Town Council for permission to remove certain trees etc.
