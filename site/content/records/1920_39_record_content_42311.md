Leighton Golf Club.  The links at Leighton were officially opened last Saturday by Mrs I.J. Warnes.  [Mr Warnes was in Sydney on business.]  Mrs Warnes explained she had had only one lesson in golf and that about 20 years ago.  She declared the links open and hit the first ball so far it took three men and two boys some time to find it.  Several Burra players attended.  Afternoon tea was provided and a dance in the hall, but only a relatively few could attend due to the state of the roads following all the rain.  Mr Murray the secretary has been transferred to another school and so Mr C. McDonald was elected to replace him.
