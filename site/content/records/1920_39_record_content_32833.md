The General Aid Society resolved last week to send £25 to the Royal Institution for the Blind and that £25 be divided between Myrtle Bank, Bedford Park and Keswick Hospitals and Angorichina Hostel and the Brandt Fund.  £5 would also go to Burra Benevolent Society for the old and needy and £5 to Rev. Lawson’s appeal for a destitute case in Kooringa.  £3 would go for trays for use in Burra Hospital Wards.
