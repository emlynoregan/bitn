Golf.  After being defunct for three years the move to re-form the Burra Golf Club got under way on Monday.  Mr Marston, the retiring President was in the chair.  There was Â£2 in the bank.  Dr Steele was elected President with Messrs Marston and Wilkinson as Vice-Presidents.  Mr Chambers is Hon. Sec. and Mr Neagle the Assistant Secretary.  The President expressed himself in favour of establishing links on the racecourse and was sure it could be done without interfering with the football ground.  The old links were in excellent condition.  It was decided to stick to the old course for this year.
