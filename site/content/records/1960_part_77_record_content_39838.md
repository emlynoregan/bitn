Theft.  Mr Norman of Hillcrest was a visitor at Burra Caravan Park last Wednesday and Thursday and had $140 worth of belongings stolen while visiting the Mine area.

Burra Police Court, last Wednesday.  Colin James Kavanagh was committed on a charge of attempted murder.

Burra Library has been struggling for some time to make ends meet and to add new material for readers.  On Friday a trading table will be held to raise funds and its success or otherwise will decide the library’s immediate future.

Weather.  Rain in the last week gave a total of 56 points in Burra.  The district falls in the agricultural area were from 50-60 points.
