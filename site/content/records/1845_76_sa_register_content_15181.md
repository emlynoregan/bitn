Rough Notes on a Journey Northwards

Auburn has a pretty location where two branches of the road from Adelaide meet; one via Baker’s Springs and the other via Riverton.  It is small, but rising with a new Bible Christian Chapel and a Church under construction.  There is a school and a Post Office in Mr Bleechmore’s store, but a new Post Office and Telegraph Stations are soon to be erected.  George Field has a steam flour mill.  The Rising Sun Inn is the best of country inns.

Then we continued to Leasingham, Watervale and Penwortham where there is Messrs Metcalf & Roach’s steam flour mill, a few houses, the Derby Arms, a Wesleyan Chapel and a Church.

Clare had four places of worship; Wesleyan, Church of England, Scotch and Roman Catholic.  Clare does extensive business at the heart of an agricultural area with considerable dairy produce too.  It has Mr Hannaford’s steam flour mill.

Pastoralism becomes prominent north of Clare and towards Burra – Hill River, Bungaree and Gum Creek Stations and a whole string of others towards the north.  Unfortunately, as a community Clare is divided into two factions who are automatically at odds with each other over every issue.

Clare to Burra was a journey through exclusively sheep country.  Mr Fisher’s Hill River Station is bare and barren of timber and given the amount of traffic between Clare and Burra, it was surprising that there was no public house for more than twenty miles until the Cross Roads Inn.

[The writer then has a long digression on the desirable attributes of country inns.]

At Burra the first house is the Burra Hotel, which has extensive accommodation.  There are only another two public houses [in Kooringa] and they have comparatively limited resources.

There are numerous stores, offices and shops, ‘none of them, however, either for style or elegance, justify eulogy’. 

The National Bank now in course of erection will be a neat building and the Institute and the Telegraph Office are decent structure, but their location towards the mine means they do not contribute to the appearance of the town.  The only handsome building in the town is the new Bible Christian Chapel.  The other places of worship; the Wesleyan and Primitive Methodist Chapels, the Church of England and the Welsh Church are ‘in notorious disproportion to their own relative importance denominationally, and to that of the place’. 

As to the nature of the town itself:

‘…no neat fenced gardens or cultivated enclosures of any kind; the streets and roads (if such you may term them, for they have never cost anything to make or maintain) a vast crying nuisance from the filthy accumulations they contain; the Burra Creek itself, which at the bottom of the town runs through it about east and west, overcharged with ore shines from the mine dressing floors; the whole place nearly shut in by the adjacent hills from all prospect, and those hills themselves divest of tree, or plant, or trace of cultivation, or anything to relieve the dreary spectacle – picture to yourself, if you can, a locality embracing the foregoing characteristics, nothing overdrawn, and you have Kooringa, a scene of the wildest and most cheerless desolation in our experience.’

There is a population of some 4,500 souls and ‘there ought to be a flourishing and handsome town’. 

But it seems it is the result of the owners refusing to alienate the land except on short term leases of 21 years.  The Bible Christian Chapel is the exception, having obtained a 99-year lease.  The town has no Council machinery of any sort and hence its squalor.  Adjacent are Redruth (with the Court House and Gaol), Aberdeen and Copperhouse and these, while a slight improvement, ‘partake more or less of the withering aspect of their original’.  The reducing population due to the migration to Wallaroo has the storekeepers in violent competition for business.  [Continued 23 December.]
