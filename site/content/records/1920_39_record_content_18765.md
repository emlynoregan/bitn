E.W. Crewes writes re the removing of the guns.

He says that Maurice Collins said he reflected on the loyalty of the Council and insulted the whole community.  Mr Crewes’ remarks referred only to members of the Council who voted to remove the guns.  He then turns to the questions Mr Collins posed concerning why he did not complete the enclosing of the monument while he was in office.  He says that Mr Collins must know that he had a very strenuous time and that his health gave way, forcing him to relinquish the position as Mayor and take a trip to recuperate.  After 12 months a large deputation waited on him urging him to take office for another term and complete the Monument, which they said required another £1,500 and after consideration he had agreed.  During this time money was collected and a start made on the Monument.  He was then requested to continue and remained in office and saw the Monument completed and unveiled.  Crewes then says he thought it was only proper at that point to allow someone else to take over and complete the work.  I leave it to others to judge how things have been carried on since then.  Nothing has been done regarding the Roll of Honour.  When he retired he says he naturally gave up Chairmanship of all committees: The Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial Committee included.  As Mayor Mr Collins became Chairman of all Committees and should have gone on with the work.  This the Committee expected or they would have dealt with the money in hand.  He now expects the Committee to work with him.

Mr Collins asks who is to blame.  There is only one answer: ‘Thou art the man.’

When Mr Crewes applied to Mr Hughes for another gun he says the PM asked why he wanted another.  He was then shown the plan and told that the second one was needed to carry out the idea.

Mr Crewes then says that he hopes the Mayor and Councillors will see their way clear to carry out the original scheme and if placing the guns inside the fence opposite the Institute is not placing them in the creek, he would like to know where the creek is.

‘Returned Soldier’ also writes on the question of the guns.  He says that Mr Collins accuses him of attacking from behind a smoke screen.  He considers this reply ‘very much in the way of a gas attack’.  By becoming Mayor over three years ago Mr Collins automatically became Chairman of the Memorial Committee.  He asks whether it is not true that a prominent citizen of Burra had asked Mr Collins on several occasions to call a meeting of the Committee and it had not been done.  If it is not Mr Collins’ burden he would like to know whose it is.  He congratulates Collins for urging Dr Steele to call a meeting of the RSA, the result of which was as the writer predicted.  He says Collins ridiculed him for saying the guns would be out of sight in the new position, but he maintains that not 5% of visitors would see them in that position.  He regards the latter part of Mr Collins’ letter as too ridiculous to comment upon.

A. Coverdale writes to say that though opposed to the removal of the guns, he considers the ill feeling being generated is unnecessary and he does not believe the Councillors guilty of disloyalty or of any intention of depreciating the work done by the soldiers in the war.
