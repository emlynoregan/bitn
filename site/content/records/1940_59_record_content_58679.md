Burra Amateur Dramatic Society presented See How They Run at Burra Town Hall on Thursday and Friday last week.  The show ran very smoothly and reflected much credit on producer Trevor Jenkinson.  The hall was practically full on both nights.  The principal roles were taken by Muriel Bence, Dawn Klinberg, Bruce Nelson, Charlotte Carmody and Trevor Jenkinson, supported ably by Eric McKenna, Dick Barratt, Robert Campbell and Alec Best.
