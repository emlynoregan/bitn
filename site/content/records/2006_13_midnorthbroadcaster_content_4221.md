Barbara Wallis & Burra’s Ghosts

Ms Wallis believes at least 30% of Burra’s houses are haunted.  She cites:

A wailing ghost at the Bon Accord Cottage.

Noises and dodgy electrical circuits in the room above the Kooringa Hotel Bar.

The ghost of a nun in the Kooringa Hotel, ‘who was possibly here when the hotel was a boys’ school’.*

Visitors report ghostly encounters in Paxton Square Cottages.

A little girl died in a well c. 1850 and still spends time on the bike track.

Ms Wallis conducts historical tours of the Burra Cemetery – but not ghost tours.

[*The nun’s ghost would be somewhat unexpected here, since the former Grammar School on the site was not a Catholic institution and was conducted in a building that was demolished before the hotel was built.]
