West Burra Copper Mining Co.  First Half-Yearly Meeting

The shaft is down to 95’ of the contracted 100’.  Little ore is showing and the lode is 4’ wide.  When the shaft is at 100’ we will stop sinking and drive at the 50’ level to the centre of the lode.  It is believed that at 50’ level the drive will well pay for itself.  After testing the drive, the inspector of mines recommends continuing the shaft.  There is c. £900 in credit at present.  The flotation raised £1,200.  Expenditure so far has been £343.  [Details of which are given.]  With completion of the shaft we expect the balance in hand to be £809-1-9.  G. Lord was in the chair in the absence of the chairman.  Last Saturday ore was struck at the 95’ level 6-9” wide and it appears to be widening.
