Characteristics of the 1887 Paper.

Page 1

As usual there were large advertisements mixed with some smaller ones.  Some were local and others not.

Page 2.

Small advertisements, especially of stock sales and auctions, with public notices and market reports.

Editorials of considerable scope are regular features.

Short local news items follow with a column headed ‘Items’ which carried very brief reports which were sometimes quite cryptic, though less so to the locals of the day, of course.

There were also regional reports and sports results.

Page 3.

Small advertisements.  The news here was usually general and not local and was mixed with non-fiction articles of general interest.

Page 4.

The literary page, which was mostly a serial, but sometimes, had a short story, poem etc.  There were also patent medicine advertisements and a very large self-advertisement for the paper and printery.

In general a reasonable cover of local news, but not more than a weekly paper used to supply.
