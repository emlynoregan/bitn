An architect has been commissioned to draw up plans and specifications for the new centre, so that Council can then call tenders.  The Burra RSL Building would be transferred to Council at no cost to Council and this, it is anticipated, would represent a large cost saving to ratepayers over any alternative new facility in a less favourable location.
