Burra Golf Club – Course Greening

Kym Traegar, superintendent of the Berri Golf Club, is assisting as a consultant.  Preliminary design work has been completed and costings established.  Council will loan $175,000 to the club, to be repaid over ten years and will grant $50,000 at $10,000 per year for five years.  Private guarantors will be sought for the amount of $100,000.  Final plans and a report will now be drawn up.
