The Soldiers’ Aid Society wound up the year on 11 January.  Miss E. Bubb reported on the year’s work at Jubilee Hall.  Next year they hope to meet in the new Redruth Sunday-school.  £85 was sent to the Royal Institution for the Blind, £15 went to Red Cross to purchase delicacies for sick soldiers for Christmas and an annual dinner to local returned servicemen was given on the Saturday of the football finals.
