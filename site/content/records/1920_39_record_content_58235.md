Mongolata

Rev. Donald Redding made a special appeal at Wednesday evening’s service for a donation in lieu of the Strawberry Fete.  Since he and his party have been coming out to the goldfield for about twelve months without taking up any offertories, this would show a little appreciation of their efforts.  Mr Dollman led the community singing afterwards.

The week produced 105 points of rain.

Weather.  Rain on Friday was steady and in Burra totalled 94 points.  To the east rain was general, but tailed of the further to the east one went.  Mongolata had 70 points, Woolgangi 22 and Koomooloo 14.

Heavy rain followed on Sunday and the creek past the Burra Hospital flooded for the first time in eight years.  Kooringa registered 129 points (73 of them in one hour.)

Similar falls were common in the agricultural areas, but were more variable further east.  Mallett reported 135 points in less than an hour and there was flooding from Ulooloo Creek.  Koomooloo registered 86 points, Quondong 100, Canegrass 125, Pine Valley 49, Mongolata 39 and World’s End 74.
