Kooringa News

Last Thursday, the Queen’s Birthday, all businesses in Kooringa were closed and everyone seemed to be out of town.  In the evening there was a grand fireworks display in Market Square.  The principal pieces were really good, but owing to the boisterous weather they were not seen to best advantage.  After the fireworks there was a dinner at the Miners’ Arms attended by nearly all the storekeepers and other gentlemen.  After the removal of the cloth Mr Chapman took the chair for the toasts and musical items, ending with the National Anthem.
