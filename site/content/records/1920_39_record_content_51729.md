Weather.  Glorious rain fell last Tuesday and was accompanied by half an hour of hail, which blocked gutters and caused problems.  Street gutters and drains were also blocked threatening flooding at Bence’s and for the shops from Frank Harris’s to Drew & Crewes’, but the danger was averted.  Hail in spoutings did result in minor water damage to some buildings.  At Leighton hail the size of marbles was reported.  Burra received 66 points and 1 inch fell at Leighton, but the fall was confined to a belt extending to Baldina and World’s End.  Springbank got only 5 points.

Another 66 points fell in Burra on Sunday and this fall was more general in the agricultural areas with many reports between 40 & 80 points.  World’s End got 75 and Robertstown 114, but it did not extend further east, where only very low falls are reported.  There was a good flow down Burra Creek.
