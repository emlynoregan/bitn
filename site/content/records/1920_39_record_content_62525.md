The Tractor Demonstration at Glen Finch’s last Tuesday drew a good crowd.  [Detail in ¼ column.]

Miss Molly Walker was presented with a handsome silver salver by the CWA Younger Set as a farewell gift in recognition of services rendered.

Mr H.A. Banks is the newly arrived manager for Drew & Crewes Ltd.  He took up his duties on Monday.  He comes from Paskeville, where he has disposed of his business to Mr S.M .Lane, late of Kooringa.  Mr Banks is a returned man and will be an acquisition to the ranks of the local RSL.
