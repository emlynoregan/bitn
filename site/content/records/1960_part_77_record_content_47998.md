Burra Mine

A meeting at Burra Town Hall on Friday was arranged by the Burra Burra DC to consider the implications of the re-opening of the mine and the impact on historical buildings there.  The Directors of the new company were anxious to give information to the district as soon as possible.

Mr Claude Allen said that on 10 January 1966 the then Minister of Mines Mr S.C. Bevan accepted a proposal from Mines Exploration Ltd to commence test drilling. The present Minister gave them till 16 September 1969 to decide on continuing.  They declined and SAMIN will commence preliminary operations shortly.  With respect to Mr Ian Auhlâ€™s concerns expressed in the Advertiser about the protection of historic buildings he said several years would pass before decisions had to be made, but every care would be taken to preserve whatever was possible.  It is the opinion of those concerned that tourism and mining operations can work together.

It is anticipated the company is likely to pay about $50,000 per annum to the Council in royalties.  Mr E.T. Baulderstone asked about what would happen to waste water.

Mr Lewis said it would be recirculated or run into the creek as pure soft water. With 70-80,000 gallons used each day, the creek could be dammed to hold water six to ten feet deep and it could also be used to beautify the banks with lawns and shrubs etc.  Jobs would be offered to locals, but outsiders could be brought in if needed.  It was thought only two or three female workers would be required.  (Probably in laboratory work.)

It was likely the mine would hasten a decision on building a new High School.
