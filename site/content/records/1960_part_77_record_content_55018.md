Burra Burra Branch of the National Trust: Annual Report.

An important event was the open day at Princess Royal thanks to Mr & Mrs Andrew Tennant.  It is much as it was when built in 1864 and approximately 800 people visited it.  Mr Downer operated a five-in-hand drag to take passengers to and from Burra and for short rides around the grounds.  It was decided to use the money raised on the dugouts project.  A contract has been lent to Mr Jacka to do the restoration work and planting of native trees and shrubs has begun.

On 29 August the Australian Railway Historical Society ran a special train to Burra for the centenary of the line and we were fortunate to have a display of Maurice Perryâ€™s pencil sketches from the Burra Sketchbook in the RSL Hall along with items by the Art Group.  Tours of the town were arranged with Trust members as guides.

Mr Auhl also conducted a Living History School for Mid North Adult Education with an address and tour.  Approximately 50 attended.

We regret to record the death of J.R. Barker and in accordance with his wishes the Misses Brown have offered the branch several horse drawn vehicles, which are presently housed in the Bon Accord Buildings.  When these buildings become available it is hoped to form another museum there for agricultural implements and the stud Merino industry.  Mr Edwards Group (from SA Museum) has agreed to erect an Aboriginal artefact display in another room.  Considerable work is needed on the buildings before this can be done.

Of major concern now is the preservation of old mine buildings with Samin Ltd now at work on the site.

The Museum in Market Square has had about 2,500 paying visitors this year.
