St Mary’s had two interesting visitors on Sunday.

Miss Julia Szuster played the organ in the absence of the regular organist Mrs John Gordon.  She is the musical advisor to the Primary Section of the Education Department and a member of the Corinthian Singers.

Brother Geoffrey Calf of the Society of the Sacred Mission assisted the Rector Father John Stephenson.  He had been secretary to Fr Nicholas Allenby when the latter was elected Bishop of Kuching and more recently has been in Adelaide University studying Chinese History and language.
