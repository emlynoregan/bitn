The Record.  Last week there were three distinct editions of the paper covering extra copies of 2,500 above the ordinary issue.  The usual issue was printed on white, the second on green and the third on red paper.  These were to ventilate the different opinions of the parties concerned in the political and local option campaigns.  There was tremendous demand for the paper.  The innovation was a unique one.
