Obituary.  Mr Matthew Henry Furniss, who died at Walkerville Rd in the city on 19 June, was an early resident of Burra.  He was born at Leeds in Yorkshire and educated at Durham College.  He migrated to SA when 26 in 1851 on the John Oldham with his first wife, a sister to Mr W. West of Burra.  He came immediately to Burra and was employed by SAMA as an accountant for 21 years before being promoted to mining manager.  He left their service in 1874 and then worked for the National Bank in Adelaide until retiring 10 years ago.  When he left Burra in 1874 he was presented with a magnificent illuminated address.  He is survived by a widow, a son and a daughter.  He was a brother to Mr C. Furniss, manager of the National Bank, Kooringa.  He was highly respected for his integrity and general demeanour.  He was a keen observer of life and had a great sense of humour.  A few years ago some very humorous articles appeared in the Wallaroo Times.  One was The Cornish Sermon and another The Passon’s visit to the miner’s cottage.  He did not enter into public life, but frequently supplied columns to the daily and provincial press on items of current interest.

[Registered as Mathew Henry Furniss, died 19 June aged 70.]
