Burra Institute held its AGM on Monday last week.

The institute had spent £1 over its income in the year and was financially sound.  Library subscribers fell slightly due to population.  The size of the collection has grown.  The committee continues to foster use by children and has continued to offer free membership to certain students at Burra Primary School, Burra High School, St Joseph’s School and the schools at Mt Bryan, Hanson, Farrell’s Flat & Emu Downs, as well as a low 1/- per quarter for other juvenile members.  The juvenile section has over 800 titles.  Rates are 4/- a quarter for 2 books and 1 magazine or 5/- a quarter for 4 books and 2 magazines.  There are 107 subscribers with double membership and 70 with single, with 50 juvenile members, 29 scholarships and 1 life member.  On 1 January 1948 there were 6,054 books and 221 new books were added and after withdrawals there are now 6,149 books.

The balance in the bank on 1 January 1948 was £33-4-2 and on   31 December 1948 was £32-3-11.

H.J.B. Jennison was elected President for 1949.
