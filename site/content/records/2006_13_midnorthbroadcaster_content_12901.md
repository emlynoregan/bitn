Burra Community School’s End of Year Formal will not be held this year.  Instead there will be an evening dinner.  Principal Tony Maio said the school had opted for a more intimate send-off for the graduating students.  He said the students had committed to the dinner and were organising it.  Parents and teachers would probably be included.  The SRC is investigating and alternative event to provide the rest of the school with an end of year function.
