Fire.  On Sunday Burra was enveloped in dense smoke at about 6 p.m., but it soon cleared with a wind shift.  It came from a fire which started in Spring Gully at 3 p.m. and swept to Auburn, then with a wind change travelled back through Sevenhills to Clare.  The fire was still smouldering on Monday, having done tremendous damage.
