Weather.  The rainfall do far this year is 587 points above the whole annual average at 2,351 points.  It is the highest rainfall since 1916.

The heavy rains in October have made it impossible for prospective buyers to inspect ‘Canopus Station’ and as a result its auction has been postponed to the New Year.
