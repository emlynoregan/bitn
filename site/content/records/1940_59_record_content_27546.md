Burra Rifle Club

A report says Cabinet has approved the resumption of .303 rifle club activity from 1 July.  There will be some delay however, before rifles and ammunition can be distributed.  Clubs should elect officers.  No money is to be spent on target pits until they are approved by the Inspector of Rifle Ranges.  Once the clubs are reconstituted the Government will return to them funds held in trust.
