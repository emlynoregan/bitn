Burra Racing Club held its AGM 28 August.  President Gerald Gask reported a successful year with one meeting at Burra and the other at Balaklava, when the Burra track had not recovered from a bad day in 1956.  Efforts were made to repair the track in 1957, but eventually it had to be ploughed and cultivated and when it is ready grass will be sown.  It is expected to be ready for a meeting at Burra in March 1959.  Thirty-three horse stalls have been floored with sleepers and the rest will be done this year.  The meeting for 15 October will be at Balaklava.

[The explanation for this is a little hard to follow, but it seems that the eight clubs in the Northern Racing Clubs Association agreed that each would give up one home race in the next eight years and instead hold it at Balaklava, where a good return could be expected.  The profits from that meeting would be split with 80% going to the Association and 20% to the club concerned.  The Association share would go into a fund to provide improved amenities for country racing.  Burraâ€™s surrendered meeting was to be the 15 October 1958 event.]
