District Ranger Ian Falkenberg successfully returned a wedge tailed eagle to the wild near Mt Bryan last week.  It had been found near Hallett suffering from minor wing damage, perhaps from hitting a fence or power lines while hunting in March.  The same bird was found in August last year in a poor condition in a paddock near Burra, unable to fly.  This is not uncommon for young eagles who fail to make the grade and find it hard to find food in cold winters.  After a brief stay in captivity at the Monarto Zoo facility it was released in October last year.  Wedge tail eagles rarely get a second chance and over 60% of young eagles die in their first year.
