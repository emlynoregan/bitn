Hortense Icecold & Darby Munroe (Mr & Mrs Harold Kowald)

They were presented to Lord and Lady Ugh of Uggville (Mr & Mrs Mal. Kellock), who were preceded by two ‘dainty’ flower girls:

Jacqueline Sawcut & Rhonda Candle (John Carpenter & Ron Wickes).

As a result the Burra Primary School Welfare Club netted over £94.
