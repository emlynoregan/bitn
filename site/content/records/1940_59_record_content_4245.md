Local Board of Health.

Council has inspected drains along the creek.  They were filthy and the properties concerned should have sealed pits built.  The area was alive with mosquitoes.  Cr Lott offered used oil to control the mosquitoes.  Offer accepted.  The question of sealed pits is to lie on the table.
