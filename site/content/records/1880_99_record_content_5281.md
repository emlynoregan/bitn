Mr M. Rayner was then recommended for the position in North Ward.

He accepted the nomination and said he supported tree planting and opposed any local impost on stock sales that would hamper them, but thought that Â¼d a head for sheep, with a discount for large numbers, 3d a head for cattle and 6d a head for horses, would not be a burden.  Funds should be spent where most needed even irrespective of ward boundaries.

Mr Rayner then took the chair and J.D. Cave moved thanks to Mr Lane as retiring Mayor.
