Advertisement.  W.W.G. Nicholls of the ‘Friend of the Million,’ ‘Temperance Hotel,’ Hindley Street announces his intention of rebuilding the same on a commodious scale.

[He continues at length on his ambitions to unite the working classes into a force for their own advancement in a self-supporting and loving brotherhood.  He urges new-comers to be careful of their cash, not to rent land or gamble away their reserves, but to buy land directly on offer at the Government Land Office at £1 per acre.  He also criticises those who exploit new arrivals by overcharging for the fare from the port to the city.  These points are developed at length!

He adds that at the Temperance Hotel discussions of the Science of Society are held in the coffee room and that all men, who wish to be free, should support the Register and the Observer, the only poor man’s newspapers in the colony.]
