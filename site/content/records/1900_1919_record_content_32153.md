Utica Copper Mine.  Mr Jones, the Inspector of Mines, with Mr W. Allen, the promoter of the syndicate, visited Burra on Monday & Tuesday and inspected the mine, which is in section 3 Hundred of Kooringa, between Mr Heinrich’s and Princess Royal.  He says it has the best surface show he has seen in the state.  He also inspected the Ballast Quarry and had a casual look over the old Burra Mine.

Copper has reached almost £80 a ton.
