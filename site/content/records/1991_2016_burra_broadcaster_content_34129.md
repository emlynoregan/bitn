Letter.  Tony Thorogood writes saying he has received much support since his last letter.  A few years ago there was a proposal to design an industrial precinct on the old Copper House Road [presumably he means Copperhouse St] and this site would have the advantage of access to piped gas.  A Councillor has said though, it would be too costly to get three phase power, water and telephone to the site.
