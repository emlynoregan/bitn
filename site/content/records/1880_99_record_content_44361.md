Cricket.  The third ‘test’ match between Quarrymen and Gentlemen was abandoned by the Gentlemen picking up their stumps and clearing at 6 p.m. instead of completing the game which would have taken but a few minutes more.  The earlier games went one to each side.

Scores:	Gentlemen	49 & 63	(112)

Quarrymen	41 & 2 for 53	(94)

[Which probably explains the Gentlemen’s decision to leave hurriedly at 6 p.m.]

[Personal interest: for the Quarrymen C. Fuss scored 0 and A. Fuss 8 in the 1st innings and in the Gentlemen’s 2nd innings an unspecified Fuss took two catches.]
