Dr Steele writes that when Mr Davey was approached by members of the house-committee it was as a member of the Board and they wished to handle the matter quietly and tactfully, rather than have him act in his strictly official capacity.

Dr Steele reiterates his view that the condition was the result of an accident.  The rooms had been recently cleaned and indeed one was faultless.  No beds were made up and none was fouled by a cat â€“ though clearly one had been slept on by a cat with muddy paws.  Clothes on the verandah had been cleaned and spread there to dry when the rain started.  Precincts were untidy, but not insanitary.
