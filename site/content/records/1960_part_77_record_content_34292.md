Weather.  Seasonal conditions.

April was mild to cool with scattered light showers.  Feed remains adequate, but a shortage is approaching as ‘green pick’ dries off.  Supplementary feeding is increasing.  Sheep are generally in good condition.  Market prices remain firm.  Autumn lambing rates appear to be good on preliminary figures.
