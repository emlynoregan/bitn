Kooringa News, 4 December

On 4 December a poor widow who makes a living by affording food and shelter to wandering bushmen was charged with keeping a disorderly house.  It seems that one night two or three men returned to her house ‘the worse for beer’ and sang a song or two.  Mr MacDermott considered the charge proved and fined her 10/- or a week in gaol.  A Samaritan kindly paid the fine for her to spare her imprisonment.

The exodus from Burra has resumed, with Messrs Larwood, Francis & Co. using their respective teams to take families to Wallaroo.

The Central Road Board has not kept the promise it made to complete the road and make a bridge near the Mine Store.  Work stopped abruptly and was left in a very dangerous condition.

There was another fire towards Booborowie on Friday 29 November.
