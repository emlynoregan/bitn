Burra Town Council, 4 October

The Local government Dept reports that the Inspector has examined certain bridges in Burra and necessary repairs will be made as soon as possible.

The Fire Brigade wrote asking Council to have sleeping quarters at the local fire station kalsomined and the crack in the room repaired.

Council noted that it only rented the building and will enquire who is responsible for repairs.

Â£1-1-0 was donated to Minda Home.
