Christopher Tennant Fisher, retired farmer, who had been living with the deceased for about 15 years:

Evidence was largely as has previously been reported.  He added that if after firing the shot the person had returned to rob Harold’s room he would have run into Fisher.  When Harold came home I said ‘Have you heard the news, your father is shot.’  Did not tell him he was dead and Harold did not go to see.
