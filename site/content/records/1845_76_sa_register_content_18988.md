Kooringa News, 28 September

Bad news continues to come from the north about the state of the country there.  The destruction of flocks has been so great that at least one owner is not employing shearers, but is doing it all himself with the aid of his brother.

I recently went across the Baldina Plain as far as King’s Well and on the plain there is as much grass as on the streets of Adelaide.

Wool drays are beginning to come through Kooringa; those from Ketchowla being the first.

The weather has been very squally of late.  Yesterday there was a hurricane of wind and dust and this morning brought a light shower.

Messrs Stobie & Morrison were fined for trespassing on Gum Creek Run with their sheep longer than allowed by the Act for travelling.

The same firm has been busy removing and selling the stock of W.H. Stanbury, of which they were the successful tenderers.
