Inquest/Obituary.

J.D. Cave JP held an inquest on 5 August into the sudden death that morning of Robert Dell at the Aberdeen Hotel.  He had arrived at the hotel on Monday night about 12 o’clock by coach from Pt Augusta and complained of having caught a violent cold through sleeping in a damp hut.  On Tuesday he was still complaining and spitting blood, but was not supposed to be seriously ill.  At 6 o’clock Wednesday morning he said he felt very bad and took some brandy and water, but could not eat.  At 7 a.m. Dr Dashwood was sent for, but was not at home and at 8 o’clock deceased was found sitting on the sofa, dead.  Dr Dashwood said he had known the man as a patient for about nine years and last saw him 18 months ago.  He suffered from dropsy arising from a heart affection.  He concluded that death was due to heart disease accelerated by congestion of the lungs and that was the verdict of the jury.

[In view of the above the death registration would seem to be in error: Robert Mark Dell died 5 August 1874 aged 63 at Caltowie, residence Caltowie.]
