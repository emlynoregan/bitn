Edith M. Carpenter, President of the Burra Branch of the Arts Council of SA reports on the past year.

The Arts Access Scheme now allows branch committees to arrange their own shows to augment the program provided by the central Committee.

In July we organised our first Arts Access presentation – singer Lorna Orr and pianists Cathy Steer and Jack Coombs.  Arts Access also allowed for Graham McCarthy to attend the AGM.  Central Services provided Sleuth in March and the ‘Mucky Duck’ Band in September.

School programs for the year were:

Peasants All

Mucky Duck Bush Band

Brenda Wooton & Pipi Storm for ‘Come Out Week’

Pipi Storm also presented ‘Kids Kabaret’ in the evening.

We have worked with Burra Burra DC to assess improvements at Burra Town Hall.  As part of International Year for the Disabled we facilitated films for the Senior Citizens of Burra.
