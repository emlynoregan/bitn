Burra Corp. The lawyer W.H. Bundey, acting as an arbitrator in the matter of the rate assessment, gave the following opinion:

The problem stems from Part XIII, clause 151, of the Municipal Corporation Act, 1861. This says that a declaration of rents profits and receipts estimated for the year and of the proposed outlay and expenditure for the same shall be published in the Govt. Gazette on or before 1 Sept. each year. Clause 152 says that in order to raise the funds above the council may order assessments etc. to be made. Clause 164 allows the declaration of a rate, but not one over 1/without the ratepayers' consent.

The publication of these estimates can only be for the ratepayers' information as the council itself doesn't need the publication. The word `shall' in clause 151 means that publication is essential for the validity of the assessments and rates to be imposed. Other corporations have also failed to do so at some time (Adelaide, Kensington & Norwood, Gawler, Glenelg, Port Adelaide, and Brighton.)  They have had to resort to getting a validating clause from parliament.

Because the year referred to in the relevant clauses is a calendar year, it must run from 1 Jan. to 31 Dec. The Corporation may be in error in making the rate retrospective in part, but that is a moot point.

On balance the dissenters, upon payment of the 1/- in the Â£ should be free of any other payment until the year 1878 and while they could take the matter further they would seem to suffer no disadvantage if they were to accept that the payment runs to 31 Dec. 1877 and if the Corporation does so too, as the parties agreed at the start of this arbitration.
