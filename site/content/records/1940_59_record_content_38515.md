Snow.  For the second time in eight days Burra has had a fall of snow.  There was a fall this morning at about 9 a.m.  Rain washed it away as soon as it fell in the town, but some of the surrounding hills were lightly covered.

Mt Bryan East had the heaviest fall of snow for some years on the afternoon of Sunday 22 August. The hills in the western half of the district were covered and a patch of snow could still be seen near the summit of Mt Bryan on Thursday.  Rainfall across the district ranged from 125 to 230 points.
