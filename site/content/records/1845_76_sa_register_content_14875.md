Obituary/Inquest.  J.B. Anderson JP conducted an inquest on Thursday into the death of William Peters who committed suicide the previous evening.

Susan Peters; wife of the deceased:

He committed suicide at about 5 p.m.  He had been in a very low sate after going unsuccessfully to seek work at Black Point about five weeks ago.  He had never threatened or attempted suicide before.  He had been looking for the lost child.  When he came home I asked about the child and he said he was all right.  They had got him out of a well and he had seen him carried home.  He went into the bedroom and soon afterwards my little girl said there was something wrong with him.  I called out to him and then went in and found him on the floor, bleeding.  She had not quarrelled with her husband and he was not addicted to drinking.  He had been acting strangely since his return from Black Point and she had thought it prudent to conceal his razor and such things, though she did not think he would cut his throat.
