The Loving Shepherd window commemorates Alfred & Priscilla Barker and their grandchildren Priscilla Maude Maclean [d. 1867], Ella McLean [d. 1871] & Hector William Barker [d. 1887].  [The maker is not known.]

Three memorial windows were added on Sunday:

The St George window in the transept which reads: ‘AMDS and in loving memory of Morton Reginald Sandland, born at Koonoona Station and killed in action at Beersheba, on October 31 1917 aged 27 years.  Duty nobly done.’  [The maker’s name is not known.]

The great western window of over 150 square feet which is dedicated: ‘To the greater glory of God and in proud memory of Waldemar Robert Hawkes, and those brave and gallant heroes from this parish who gave their lives in the great war 1914-1919’

[This window has four main lights featuring St Edmund, St Alban, St Mark, St Andrew, St Michael, St George, St Faith and St Agnes.  There are also three smaller superior lights showing Samuel, David and a heavenly orchestra.  It was made by Jones & Willis of London in 1921.]

The St Peter window in the nave commemorates John Bailey who died 3 October 1913 and his wife Elizabeth Dinah Bailey who died 17 April 1920.  [Made by Jones & Willis of London in 1921.  John Bailey was a farmer at Gum Creek.]

The three windows are said to have cost together c. £1,300.
