For some years the station has been too small to adequately house the MFS facility and the move will allow for a larger and more modern fire engine.

The Burra National Trust owns the original Model T fire truck [Photo].  It was purchased from an Eyre Peninsula farmer and restored.  The Trust also owns two other Burra fire engines – the 1936 Diamond T and the 1948 Dennis, which have done the Bay to Birdwood Run for a number of years.

[1 The first station foreman was H.R. Bosisto, who was appointed early in 1922.  He was in charge at least till late 1923.  Ilene Campbell’s Father was W.J. Lee, who was certainly one of the firemen, but further research would be needed to see if/when he took over the role of foreman.

2 The idea that the MFS operated outside the Town Council Area, at least until the amalgamation of the Town and District Councils, needs research.  The idea that the Town Council would happily fund activities in the District Council area seems unlikely.

3 Butterworth’s Mill operated only between 1874 and 1892.

4 The site for the Fire Station was not approved until early 1922.  The building was completed in August 1922, the same week that the Model T Ford fire engine arrived on Thursday 17 August.

5 The fire bell was originally located at the Kooringa Police Station, where it had been for many years.  The Town Council passed a resolution to relocate it to the Fire Station in November 1923, though they had only a little earlier considered such a public position was too tempting for misuse.

A siren was installed in 1925.]
