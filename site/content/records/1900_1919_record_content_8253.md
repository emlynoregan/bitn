A Juvenile Bazaar last year, organised by eight girls raised £6 for the Hospital funds.  They were Nellie and Rita Vivian, Dorothy and Renie Crewes, Nellie and Nita Pearce, Millie Pascoe and Ivy Ward.  They decided to buy a ‘Spinal Carriage’ for the Hospital which cost £8-14-0.  On 25 July they, together with Eileen Johnson and Nellie Moody, had a second bazaar which this time raised £16-7-6.  The money for the carriage left £14-3-6 to go towards the fund for lighting the Hospital with acetylene.
