Obituary.  John Vivian died on 11 April 1889.

[Though a long time before, this is the correct date: the article is a reprint from the Bible Christian Magazine.]

He was the son of Sampson & Jane Vivian and was born at St Austell, Cornwall in 1809.  His father was killed in a mining accident when he was very young.  John went to work rather than stay at school. At 21 he married Miss Williams.  Leaving Cornwall, he went to Tavistock in Devon and met Mr John Torr where they both worked in a mine.  Both were trained in religious principles.  He later moved to Ashburton and then Liskeard and he was active in church and Sunday school work and was a circuit steward.  In 1885 [sic] he came to SA and Burra, becoming an early member of the Bible Christian Church there.  He continued to serve God for over 30 years.

[This last sentence suggests he arrived in Australia not in 1885, but perhaps in 1855, or if the numbers were inverted, in 1858, in any case 1885 is surely wrong.]
