Council Amalgamation.  The editor commented that Hallett and Terowie meetings showed that whatever the outcome, there will be a large group of dissatisfied ratepayers.  Terowie residents who look to Peterborough for shopping have already had the door slammed in their face and Hallettâ€™s western residents will likely miss out on increasing their ties with Jamestown.  Intransigence however, could be counterproductive if it prolongs argument to the point where it is too late to enter into a new area on your own terms.
