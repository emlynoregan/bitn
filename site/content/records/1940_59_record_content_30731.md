G.H. Dow was tendered a farewell at the Burra Town Hall on Tuesday afternoon 18 March.  He was visiting the town for a few days before leaving for Melbourne.  The gathering was small due to short notice and the afternoon time.  Speakers were the Mayor Mr Jennison, S. Kellaway, Mr Bence and Mr R.C. Lott.  Mr G.E. Dane sent a letter as he was ill in Burra Hospital.  [This was corrected in the paper of 8 April to say that although ill he was not in hospital.]  The Mayor referred to Mr Dow’s 17 years as secretary of the Burra Sub-Branch of the RSL.  [This figure would bear checking I suspect.]  He was also secretary of the Burra Hospital, Burra Racing Club and District Clerk for the Apoinga Dc and later the Robertstown DC.  In the Town Council he had been Councillor for West Ward [December 1932 to October 1938] and he had acted as auditor for many societies including the Burra Burra Show Society.  He had been organist at St Mary’s.
