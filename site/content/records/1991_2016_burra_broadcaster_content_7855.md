Adelaide Male Voice Choir entertained an enthusiastic audience at Burra Town Hall on Saturday night.  The 56 strong choir toured the UK last year.  They also led the singing at the ecumenical service at St Mary’s on Sunday afternoon and some 25 who remained for Sunday evening, gathered at the Kookaburra woolshed for a relaxing evening and celebration of Les & Grace’s 40th wedding anniversary.
