W.H. Rosman was farewelled at the Institute on Tuesday when 40-50 gentlemen assembled to present him with an address.  He has been a resident for nearly 22 years and is moving to Adelaide.  Mr Lane was in the chair for Mr Holder whose Parliamentary duties had taken him to Adelaide.  Mr Rosman was thanked for his efforts almost 18 years earlier to get the railway extended to Burra and also for his services as manager of the local branch of the Bank of Australasia for 13 years.  He was also prominent as treasurer and secretary of the Burra Mechanics and Miners Institute and had been a churchwarden and sat on various church committees over the years as well as playing a major role in the construction of the new St Maryâ€™s church.  He had been a strong promoter of the Burra Hospital.  Many people spoke in warm support of his actions.
