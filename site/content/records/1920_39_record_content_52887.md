Edgar Schutz of Kooringa brought into the office examples of tobacco light, dark and medium and several varieties of cigars made and grown on the plantation of his Brother Herbert Schutz of Gisborne New Zealand.  We must say the product was good and superior to the Australian article.  Mr Herb Schutz is well remembered in Burra.
