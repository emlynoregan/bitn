Matt Reilly took a trio of old identities on a round trip through the eastern country that they were associated with when young.  They were:

Ron Dewhirst (88), who had an accounting business in Booborowie until Trevor Willis took over some ten years ago.  Ron recalled being a driller for I.J. Warnes in the 1920s and of riding his bike in from Koomooloo to play football in Burra.

Bob Radfordâ€™s family started at Glenora in 1892 and at Canegrass in 1903.

John McBride, also in his 80s started at 16 on a station out of Mannahill and spent nine years there, until war broke out.  He was then stationed at Parafield and Mallala as a flying instructor, before being sent with 24th Squadron south of Darwin, from where sorties were run to Bali.  After the war he went to Kia Ora, which he managed for forty years.

The group went out to Old Koomooloo, where Eddie Keogh and his team were shearing.  They had lunch at Canegrass, where Bob Radford reminisced about how they bought sheep at Wilcannia and walked them down to Canegrass.  They then passed Pine Valley, Sturt Vale and saw the abandoned homestead at Braeside before going on to Murkaby as they came home.
