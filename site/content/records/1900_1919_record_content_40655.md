Burra Racing Club.  The annual race meeting had made a loss of £125.  I.J. Warnes presided and was surprised and disappointed at the absence of the President, Mr A.G. Gebhardt, at this time of crisis.  Thomas McWaters wondered who owned the improvements: if it was the sporting syndicate they could guarantee the overdraft.  G. Lord said £300 of improvements had been erected.  The club had failed to go through with getting a lease and therefore had no claim on the improvements.  Mr Truscott said the difficulty is entirely our own fault.  A lease had been offered at £10 p.a. for 20 years and the Racing Club had failed to follow through.  It was decided to try and get sheep men to give donations to write off the debt; in the meantime the committee would guarantee the debt.
