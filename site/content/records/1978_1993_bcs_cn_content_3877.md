Burra National Trust will meet next on 7 April at 8 p.m. in the old Council Meeting Room at the Burra Town Hall (on the right hand side of the foyer).  The idea is to look at the room with the aim of setting it up so that visually it appears as the original Council Meeting Room of Burra.

[Actually this was not really the idea.  Given that the impressive council furniture dates only from 1936 and replaced furnishings that were described as a disgrace, it seems hardly likely that a period any earlier than 1936 would have been the aim.]
