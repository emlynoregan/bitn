Burra’s Heifer Triplets, announced born on 12 May to a black Jersey-Friesian cross cow owned by R. Garrard of Burra, are believed to be the first identical triplet heifers in Australia.  Only four other sets are known in the world: one in Sweden and three in Minnesota, USA.  At the end of April a set of identical triplet bull calves were born in NSW to an Illawarra Shorthorn cow.
