Burra Horse Riding Club has its last outing for 1943.  18 riders went over Brewery Hill and along the Morgan Road to Mr Harry Mannâ€™s residence and then on towards the Baldina Road, stopping for a while at ruins of an old residence where there is still a fine fruit garden.  A program for 1944 will be drawn up after a break for harvest with the next outing planned for 15 January.  The riders returned on a back road and across open country.
