Sir Hubert Wilkins is perhaps one of the most underrated Australian adventurers of the twentieth century, but functions at Hallett and Mt Bryan East over the weekend could begin to redress that.  Modern day adventurer and entrepreneur Dick Smith flew in to open the restored Wilkins’ Family homestead at Mt Bryan East on Sunday afternoon.  The replica Southern Cross plane made a trip from Parafield over the area.  Sir Hubert sold the original ‘Southern Cross’ to Charles Kingsford Smith, who then fitted it out for the historic crossing of the Pacific Ocean.  Hubert Wilkins, or George as he was known locally, was a key figure in exploration of the Arctic and also made several trips to Antarctica.  He was later based in New York, but always considered himself an Australian.  The Chairman of the Sir Hubert Wilkins Memorial Committee praised the builder of the restored homestead, Neil Schiller of Burra for his workmanship and also mentioned the long list of people who had been associated with the Twilight Jazz Affairs for the past four years.  The Wilkins homestead has changed hands many times since the Wilkins with their 13 children lived there in the late nineteenth century.  Goyder Council bought the land from Brian Guthrie, who had bought it from Robin Jones.

On Saturday night more than 300 people filled Hallett Hall to see the film documentary Ice Maverick – still a few months from completion.  During his lifetime Sir Hubert received widespread acknowledgement and awards from the most important geographical and scientific societies for his work in the fields of geography, climatology and meteorology.  When 17 he taught himself the use of a movie camera and projector.  In 1910, at 22, he learnt to fly a plane and filmed across enemy lines in the Balkan conflict in 1913, after which he was awarded the Military Cross.

[While strictly true, this statement is misleading.  He was awarded a Military Cross, but this was in World War I after the Battle of Hamel in June/July 1918.  He was also awarded a bar to the Military Cross in September 1918.]

He spent three years in the Arctic and joined the Shackleton expedition [to Antarctica] in 1921.  In 1923 he led an expedition in tropical Australia and in 1928 made the first successful flight across the Arctic, covering 3,500 km from Alaska to Spitsbergen.  The American newspaper giant Randolph Hearst was his major backer.  He then [1929] took a round the world flight in the airship Graf Zeppelin and married [Australian singer and actress Suzanne Bennett].  He also bought a decommissioned US submarine for $1 and attempted [in 1931] to take it under the ice to the North Pole.  After his death in 1958 aged 70 his ashes were scattered at the North Pole [1959] by an American submarine crew.  [Photos: 1 on page 1, 6 on page 4 and 2 on page 5.]
