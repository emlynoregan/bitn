Children’s Sports were organised at the playground on Saturday 2 January and over 300 children with their parents attended.  This was mainly possible due to the generosity of George Gallagher.  At 4.30 p.m. every child up to 14 was given a bag of sweets, peanuts, bun etc. (200 in all).  Mr Gallagher was assisted by Messrs S. Jones, B. Opperman, T. Carpenter & J. Carpenter.  Results are printed.
