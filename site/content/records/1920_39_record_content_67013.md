Parking Experiment in Market Square

Many farmers have been complaining of the parking ban between Drew & Crews & Wilkinson’s Pharmacy.  Businessmen are also opposed.

Cr Dow considers it the most dangerous corner in town and that the silent cop near the Commercial Bank is misplaced making it more dangerous.

Cr Kellaway thought that as far as Spencer’s would be far enough to ban parking.

Cr Jeffery thought the move too drastic.  The area in front of Miss Warner’s shop was the most dangerous.

‘A Disgusted Motorist’ writes that the town will lose shoppers to Clare if the parking ban remains.  (Especially Farrell’s Flat folk.)  There has been no real problem in the 60 odd years that the town was incorporated.
