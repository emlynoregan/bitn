Burra Show – advance publicity.

President Ian Slade says this year there would be more community displays – BCS, the Church of England Sunday School, the Obedience Dog Club and many more.  As well as the exhibitors’ sections there will be the yard dogs, Burra Shearing Competition, the Kangaroo Street Road Show to entertain the small folk and the choosing of the Rural Ambassador, sheep counting, industrial sites and, of course, side shows.

The Burra Show Society has submitted a request for a grant under the Community Heritage Scheme to restore and preserve old photographs that illustrate the long history of the Show Society.  This has been christened ‘Project 2000’.  The Society hopes to display some of its old trophies on show day.

Denis Keller, Chairman of the Regional Council of Goyder will officially open the show.
