Burra Show Society

I.J. Warnes, who has been away from the district, wanted to catch up with preparations.  The Governor has sent a letter hoping he can be present and arrangements were then made accordingly.  As it was probably his last year as President Mr Warnes wanted to entertain all at the official lunch at his own expense.  He was clearly opposed to the moving of the ring and of the date, both of which had been done in his absence.

Mr Bartholomaeus thought the President’s remarks were unfair and Mt Radford said the Polo Club would use the ground frequently necessitating the move agreed to.

Mr Warnes was annoyed with the Sporting Syndicate, which he saw as interfering with the improvements the Show Society had made and as for the Polo Club he had little faith in it – Burra was noted for starting things and never finishing them.  The President thought without a 99-year lease it was not worth making improvements.
