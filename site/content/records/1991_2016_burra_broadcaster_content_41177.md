Wheetelande White Suffolk Stud

A recent sale of a ram at the Adelaide Royal Elite Sale went for $22,000 and a second realised $11,000.  A supreme all breeds ewe sold for a breed record of $4,750.  They won Supreme White Suffolk Exhibit.  Bob & Idrienne Neill have decided to disperse the stud to allow for retirement.  The breeding ewes will be offered on 11 January 2016 and the 2015 drop lambs will be sold at their annual and last October sale in 2016.  This yearâ€™s 14th Annual On-Property Sale will offer 100 rams on Tuesday 6 October.
