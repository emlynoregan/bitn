Burra Amateur Swimming Club.  At a meeting on last Friday it was decided to extend the ‘Learn to Swim Campaign’ for another week to conclude on Saturday 12 March. Instruction will be given from 10 a.m. to noon and from 2.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.  People using the pool will be asked to pay a small membership fee of 2/- adult and 6d children to defray the expenses the club has incurred.  Chief Instructor Norman Thomas of Adelaide was thanked for his work.  He returned to the city on Saturday.  R.J. Burt will fill the role for the last week.  Of the pupils about 60 were taught to swim and others are approaching that stage.
