Mongolata Goldfield

For Bylesâ€™ Mongolata rails have been taken out to make a direct line to the battery which it is hoped will be erected soon.

W. Pexton & Sons and The Golden Harp both report good finds.

Experts on the field are very hopeful of the alluvial workings.

The domestic water tank has been completed and the recent rains should have put significant water in it.
