Rev. F.H. Durnford has been appointed Chaplain with Australian troops and received only 24 hours notice to join them.  A farewell social was hastily arranged in St Mary’s Schoolroom on Wednesday evening last.  Rev. Bloyd and Mr Winnall spoke and so did Mr Treloar, Mr Page and Mr Crewes.  Mr Durnford made a suitable response.  He left on Thursday morning’s train.
