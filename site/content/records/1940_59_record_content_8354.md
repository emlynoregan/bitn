Home Guard Notes.  On Sunday 14 December the Home Guard held a field-craft exercise.  At 10.15 a.m. the Home Guard received news that a party of saboteurs had arrived in Burra North and gone to ground.  All did not go well.  While several saboteurs were taken prisoner, the saboteurs also took prisoners, including the OC and Sergeant of the Home Guard.  The Home Guard Headquarters were totally destroyed, the powerhouse was wrecked and the water tank blown up.  Burra was therefore in a complete blackout with no water supply and essential services generally wrecked.  The Home Guard were completely demoralised.  The honours for the day went unfortunately to the saboteurs and in fact one of their number got through to the school, which was designated an ammunition dump.
