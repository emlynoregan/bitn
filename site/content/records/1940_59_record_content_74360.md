Football

Burra won the Premiership for the first time in eighteen years when it defeated Hallett by three points.

Burra 16.6 defeated Hallett 12.15.

The last Burra team to win a premiership was when it played in the Burra Football association in 1938.  It too was against Hallett, but was then played at Booborowie rather than at Terowie as this year.  In the last few minutes [in 1938] Joff Hill slammed the final goal to take the premiership by three points.   [See 59, 38, 20 Sep. 1938, page 1: In the Grand Final at Booborowie last Saturday:

Kooringa 14.10 (94) defeated Hallett 12.19 (91).]

Before the start of the ‘A’ Grade Grand Final, after the Ashmore Shield had been presented to the Burra Colts Captain, Mr J. Jenner President of the Association presented the Mail Medal to Keith Warrior.  This was his fourth Mail Medal, having won three while playing in the Yorke Valley Association for the Point Pearce team.

[Page 6 adds that Burra Colts 11.12 defeated Hallett Colts 7.7 to win the Ashrose Shield.]
