Burra Institute AGM.

The annual report for the year ending 31 December 1932 showed the library held 7,399 volumes.  The loss of the Government subsidy of £150 has made life difficult.

Free tickets have again been awarded the most eligible scholars at Burra Public Schools and Copperhouse School.  Membership has fallen:

31 December 1931	Double	69

Single	176

244

31 December 1932	Double	67

Single	160

227

The Chess Club went into recess at the end of winter.

Credit at the National Bank 	31 December 1931	£41-2-6

31 December 1932	£47-14-6

Dances in conjunction with the Burra Brass Band were a social and financial success.

Choral & Orchestral Classes were continued and contributed to the success of the Christmas Festival at Burra Hospital.

Elected were President, Frank T. Sara; Vice-President, C.D. Wilkinson; Treasurer, M.W. Bednall & Secretary, L.S. Penrose.
