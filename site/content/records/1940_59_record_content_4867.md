Burra Town Council, 3 February

News was received that a Government representative was to come to Burra to inspect the Ballast Quarry following the Council’s representations.  Because a large amount of ballast would be required following the recent floods, the mayor believed there was a chance that the quarry would be re-opened.

The Mayor reported that three or four small footbridges had been washed away in the recent floods and the swing bridge at Gully’s Wharf had been partly swept away.  Portions have since been recovered by the overseer.  Some of the Redruth footbridges should be replaced at a higher level.

There was a lot of debris under the big bridge at Redruth.  The St Just Street Ford had been badly damaged, but had been repaired.  The Pig & Whistle Ford also needed attention.  The crossing between the Bon Accord Hotel and the Drew & Crewes old stores had a lot of silt deposited on it.  Trees planted in that area by Messrs R. McWaters and R. Fairchild had been buried in silt.  Mr McWaters had cleared the deposits from many and so saved them, but the Mayor recommended that a man be put on to save the rest.  Silt in some places was three feet deep.

Council agreed to spend up to £4 removing silt.

Flooded areas will be inspected by Council on 10 February.  Council has already removed several loads of silt from main streets.  It was resolved that fire hydrants be used to wash Burra North main streets free of silt.

The Government will be asked for a special grant of £150 towards repairing flood damage.
