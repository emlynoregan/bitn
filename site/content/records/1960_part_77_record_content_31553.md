The three courts were top dressed.  A cyclone fence was erected and the toilets were painted and the new toilets have been paid off.  Lloyd Turner and his family were farewelled in late July, having been stalwart supporters.  The Easter Tournament was the highlight of the year and saw record entries and excellent weather.  Thanks are extended to I. Hirschausen and to BHS for the use of their courts.
