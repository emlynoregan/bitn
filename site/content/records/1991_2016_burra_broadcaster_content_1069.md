Floods.  Torrential rain last weekend saw the Burra Creek break its banks in the worst flood in living memory.  Roads were cut and the town isolated.  Burra North was worst hit.  Several homes were threatened by floodwaters.  Sandbagging was needed at the Royal Exchange Hotel, Sara’s and the Aberdeen Roadhouse.  The tributary that crosses Commercial Street broke its banks about noon and the recreation area along Burra Creek all but disappeared under water.  A number of visitors were stranded in the town overnight.  The waters had gone down by the following morning.

[Three very poor photos are printed: one of the St Just Street Ford, one of waters around Drew & Crewes’ bulk store at Burra North and the third is too poor to identify.]
