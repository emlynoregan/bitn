Captain Roach.

There is a 1¼-column article on the late Captain H. Roach by a Melbourne correspondent.  He was born in Cornwall, but spent time in America and British Columbia before coming to Burra in 1847 or 1848.  He was a widower without family and was the personification of kindness and good humour.  [Several anecdotes are included which are repeated in Ian Auhl’s Burra Reminiscences.  They include the story of the sins that lurked in the mine pool after baptisms, the tale of the miner who took time off for a tea meeting, but ate more value than he donated, and the miner who thought the highfaluting word soirée had something to do with sore eye.]

Though not a teetotaller he believed firmly in moderation.  He was a Primitive Methodist seat-holder, but not an extreme member.

The writer refers to Mr Philip Santo, who used to conduct services in a small brick chapel a few yards below the Primitive Methodist Chapel.  [Was this the Baptist Chapel?]  And to the Rev. Mr Davidson, a Presbyterian, who conducted services in a building in or near Paxton Square.  [On the site of the Kooringa Hotel.]  And that the Catholics had a place of worship in Commercial St, but he believed no resident clergyman.  He also thought the Germans held regular services somewhere in Redruth and that the Welsh took charge of Mr Santo’s chapel when he left Burra and when he was last in Burra the unused building was still called the Welsh Chapel.  [But he gives no time for that.]
