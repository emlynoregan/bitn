Kooringa News, 27 October

Miners are still leaving for Moonta and Wallaroo.

Messrs Tiver & Cole are getting on with the ford at Redruth, but progress is delayed by difficulty in getting timber for the piles.

The Total Abstinence Society had a meeting on Friday.

The waxworks exhibition opened last night in Stanburyâ€™s new store.
