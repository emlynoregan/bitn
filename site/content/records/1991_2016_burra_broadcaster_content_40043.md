The Burra Revegetation Group has been asked if they would be interested in setting up a Community Nursery in Burra.  Rob Perry of the Burra CMC said they had a great need for seedlings over the next few years, for the creek revegetation project, so the idea had merit.  A meeting to discuss possibilities will be held at a Volunteers Picnic at Pickett Reserve Sunday 30 November from noon to 2 p.m.
