Mr Warnes called on the meeting to think carefully – they couldn’t go to Burra without giving and if they tied themselves hard and fast to Mt Bryan they would be solely on their own.

The motion was then altered to put Mt Bryan first and then if they liked the Burra scheme, they would help them afterwards.

The motion was carried 9 to 1.  [This figure seems surprisingly low, given that the report also says about 50 people attended, but subsequent proceedings suggest that some 40 abstentions might have occurred.  The proceedings are not very clear, as the next paragraph says the motion was then withdrawn to enable a new one to be put.]

Mr Beaglehole then moved that Mt Bryan supported a local scheme and this time there were 30 for, 1 against and 21 abstentions.

Mr A. Pledge moved the memorial take the form of two rooms on the front of the hall.  2nd Mr Beaglehole.

Mr Warnes assured them the DC would not object if they could raise the money.  Carried.

A committee was appointed and the building is to be called the Mt Bryan Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial
