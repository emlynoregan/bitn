Clare Local Court, 16 April

Billy and Jemmy, two Aboriginal men were charged with the wilful murder of Robert Richardson, shepherd at Younguna on 14 March 1852.   Johnson Frederick Hayward gave evidence of seeing the body of the deceased who had spear wounds in the spine and loins and whose head was knocked to pieces.  Two bloodied waddies were found nearby.  Sergeant-Major William Ross gave evidence of tracking and capturing the prisoners.  Billy had a very peculiar foot, which was readily identified as being at the scene of the crime.

The prisoners were remanded for eight days to be brought up at Kooringa for re-examination.
