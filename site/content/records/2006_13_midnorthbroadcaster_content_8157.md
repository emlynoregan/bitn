Accident.  The driver of an early model Commodore was lucky to escape serious injury when his car collided head on with a 4WD early last Thursday morning on a straight stretch of road near Leighton.  It is thought the Commodore exited a driveway into the path of the 4WD.  The driver of the 4WD was uninjured.  [Photo.]
