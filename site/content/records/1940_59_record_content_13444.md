Tom Canny writes to take issue with the editor over the latter’s stand on the once-a-month market question.  Canny takes up a whole range of matters in which he asserts the present Government has done good things for the primary producer.  He says a more economical use of vehicles will be achieved, 2,000 sheep can be handled by the same number of men as 1,000.

The editor dismisses Mr Canny’s remarks as irrelevant to the topic and says Canny accuses him of making miss-statements, but doesn’t say what they were.  He then goes on to attack some of the steps the Government had taken while agreeing that the Wheat Bounty was a benefit even if it was largely negated by increased wage costs.
