Burra Classic Cycle Race

The end of the race was marred by a serious accident.  A Hyundai Getz was turning across Commercial St in front of the Commercial Hotel when 15-year-old cyclist Shaun Boyle crossed the finish line at high speed and crashed into the passenger door of the turning vehicle.  The injured rider was taken to Clare Hospital.  [3 photos]
