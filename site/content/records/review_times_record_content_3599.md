BCS students released about 200 helium-filled balloons with messages of peace on them as part of their Armistice Day peace assembly.  Principal Mr R. Henderson said this was the culmination of peace studies throughout the school for the International Year of Peace.  The balloons were paid for by selling peace badges and having a uniform free day.
