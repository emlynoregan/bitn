Burra Town Council, 7 October

The Council contribution to the Burra Hospital for the current year is to be £170.

Mr P.E. Opperman requested £3 p.a. for looking after the garden in St Dye Street.  Refused.

Following a request from the Burra Cricket Association Council agreed to repair the cricket pitches at Victoria Park, but not at the Racecourse Oval, because that was not Council property.

The Aberdeen Tennis Club requested that Council provide eight drums of Colas at cost to renovate the club’s fourth court.  The Mayor pointed out that the land was vested in the Council and the club last year spent £70 on renovations.  Request granted.
