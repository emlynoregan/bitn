AGL Power Development manager, Tim Knill spoke at a recent meeting of the Ladies Club of Booborowie.  He gave an update of AGLâ€™s progress in the mid north and specifically answered questions on possible effects on TV reception, aviation lighting, ecology issues and visual amenity.  Analogue TV reception is more apt to be affected than digital and satellite feeds are unaffected.  AGL had undertaken to overcome any problems for TV reception.
