Burra Town Council, 7 June

The Department of Lands advises concerning a road originally in the estate of the late Thomas William Powell once of Kooringa that access must be preserved and therefore a portion of the road must be kept open.

The solicitor of the Municipal Association advises that the Council representative on the Hospital Board must be elected by the Council and not by the Local Board of Health.

The Mayor said he was pleased that this point had been settled.  For 15 years the representative had been elected by the Local Board of Health.  In his opinion his ruling in the first place had been a correct one.

Cr Button was also glad to have the matter resolved.  He had never been actuated by any animosity, but only doing what he conceived to be his duty.

The secretary of the Hospital advised that members elected to the Board were Messrs [Herbert] Morgan, [Stanley] Kellaway & T.H. Woollacott.

Burra School was given permission to plant trees in the creek on Arbor Day to replace those destroyed by fire.

It was resolved to extend an invitation to the Premier to visit Mongolata on 16 June and to ask him to address a public meeting.

There was a long discussion about recommendations from the Public Works Committee about work and a move to stand down employees if the weather did not permit outside work.  The matter was referred to the Finance Committee for a report.

Graham H. Dow has been appointed Acting-Clerk of the Robertstown DC for a period of six months.
