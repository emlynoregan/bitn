Burra High School

When asked by Mr Allen whether she would consider a new school for Burra in the light of the expected boost to the town from the re-opening of the Mine, the Minister the Hon. Joyce Steele said yes.  The High School shares the old building with the Primary School, plus a number of temporary classrooms.

Mr W.A. White, President of the SA Institute of Teachers, spoke in the Burra High School Hall on 30 September on the crisis in SA education under the heading Deficiencies in Education.  Mr N. Brand, Senior Master at the High School, also spoke on the local problems with make-shift specialist rooms, lack of science facilities, overcrowding in temporary buildings, lack of planning in the yard and poor physical education facilities.  Mr Wood, Head Teacher at Booborowie, also spoke, saying he thought Primary Schools were the ‘Cinderella’ of the Education Department and small schools fared worse than larger ones.  Other problems were the stresses of multi-grade classes, the need to be teacher-drivers and accommodation difficulties.

Russell McDonald writes from NSW in appreciation of receiving the Record while serving in the Army.  He was at Burra for schooling and his parents now live at Redcliffe Station.

Burra Burra DC has appointed a Health & Building Inspector to report on all premises and where necessary to require repairs and renovations.  Many old houses and other buildings are cracked and have damp walls and lack proper bathrooms and toilets.  It is important for tourism that eyesores are eliminated.  These also lower the value of adjoining properties.
