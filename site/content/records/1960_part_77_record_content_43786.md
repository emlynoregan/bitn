Weather.  A line of thunderstorms on Thursday dumped heavy falls across the district.  A half mile wide strip of North Booborowie was flooded when 2 inches fell in half an hour.  Terowie reported another deluge.  Leighton also received heavy rain.  At Hanson and Farrell Flat falls varied from 60-70 points.  Erratic falls are reported from the east; Old Koomooloo 15 points, Koomooloo 2 points at the homestead, but over 200 on the western end of the property.  Woolgangi received 40 points.  The Booborowie deluge included hail, some of which was the size of pigeonsâ€™ eggs and creeks ran eight feet deep.  Fencing was swept away.  Damage to fallow was extensive, but areas of flooded lucerne will benefit.  The trench for the gas pipeline became a flowing stream and quite a deal of clean-up is needed.  Booborowie post office officially registered 120 points.
