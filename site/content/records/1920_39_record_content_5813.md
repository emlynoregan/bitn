Burra Show, at Aberdeen Wednesday 26 October.

The weather was good and the ground was in excellent condition.  The gate was Â£106, though it was widely asserted that many more evaded paying.  The President entertained the Committee and other guests at luncheon.  The good season produced a much improved agricultural produce display.  Dairy produce was down due mainly to the absence of the Finch family due to a recent bereavement, but poultry was much improved.  Horse numbers were up and the quality of entries was good.  Ring events were rated the best ever.  Cattle exhibits were unusually large in number and the dog section was also good.  There were no agricultural implements on display, but vehicles were present and Drew & Crewes conducted a trial of the Titan tractor and ploughs on an adjacent ground.  Vegetables, fruit, flowers and cookery were all of a high standard this year and the arts and industries and the school class entries were also good.  The evening concert was first class.
