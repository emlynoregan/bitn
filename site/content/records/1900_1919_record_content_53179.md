Booborowie School.  The Hon. L. O’Loughlin & Mr W. Miller, accompanied by Mr P. Goodridge of Booborowie waited on the Minister of Education, Hon. A.W. Styles, on Wednesday and urged the use of the block originally chosen for the Booborowie School and that the erection of the school proceed at once, as the only available accommodation was the Methodist Church, which was too small for the number of children ready to go to school.
