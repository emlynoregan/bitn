Burra Boy Scouts left on 27 September to attend the 3rd annual rally in Adelaide.  32 scouts attended and were billeted with city scouts.  Various visits were arranged on Tuesday.  They went to the Register building to see the printing of a newspaper and to the Post Office tower for a view of the city and were shown over Charles Moore’s.  [Department store in Victoria Square, now a court building.]  On Wednesday the scouts generally went to Brighton, but Burra scouts had an invitation to the Missions to Seamen at Pt Adelaide where they inspected the docks and the SAFU wool stores and saw the dumping and pressing of wool.  After a sumptuous lunch at the Mission they crossed the river by ferry to the Naval Station and then went by train to Outer harbour where they inspected two of the large vessels moored there: the Fredrickshrue & Ulysses.

On Thursday there was a trip on the tug Conqueror and on Friday a trip to Belair.  On Saturday there was the march through the city followed by the inspection by the Governor at Adelaide Oval and a church parade on Sunday at St Peter’s Cathedral ended the program.  The boys returned to Burra on Monday.
