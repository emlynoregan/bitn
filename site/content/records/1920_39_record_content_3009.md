The Holidays.

The days leading up to Christmas were very hot.  Record business was done by cool drink businesses and Christmas trade generally was very good.  A thunderstorm with heavy showers broke on Christmas Eve, but it soon passed and was followed by a cool change.

Heavy rain fell on the 26th when about 1.5” was recorded.

Burra Sporting & Athletics Club meeting on New Year’s Day on the Aberdeen Oval was the only sporting activity for the holidays. Rain set in again on 1 January and by 9 a.m. on 3 January a further 1.5” was registered.

The rainfall for 1920 was 23.31”.
