Mr & Mrs W.G. Hawkes Public Farewell

A large gathering at the Institute on Friday evening showed the esteem in which Mr & Mrs Hawkes are held.  The Mayor A.B. Riggs presided.

The Mayor said though not Burra born Mr Hawkes was one of the oldest sheep breeders in the district.  As a citizen he (Mr Riggs) had worked on many committees with Mr Hawkes and well knew the value of the latter’s help in advancing the district.  His eloquence in patriotic causes in the Great War was of immense value.  The Burra Hospital had particularly benefited by his efforts.

Cr T.H. Woollacott spoke on behalf of the Hospital Board.  Mr Hawkes had been a member for some 20 years and chairman for 8 or 9.  The Hospital, after some years of trouble was now so well run people came from as far away as Pt Augusta.

H.G. Oates spoke on behalf of the RSL acknowledging Mr Hawkes’ contribution to the war effort and to the League and its members.

Cr K.C. Sandland spoke for Apoinga DC.  It was Mr Hawkes who had pushed for closer settlement and prevailed on Koonoona Proprietors to cut up the land, despite which Koonoona had almost as many sheep as before that.  The existence of Black Springs was due to him and the Anglican Church and the public hall were due to his energy and generosity.  He had been a great stud breeder without treading on others’ toes and had been Chairman of the Apoinga DC for 30 years.

Rev. J.S.W. Coles spoke for the Anglican Church, for St Mary’s and the District.  Mr Hawkes had taken a great interest in the Black Springs mission and in the church at Booborowie (St Edmund’s).  The Hawkes’ window in St Mary’s was equal to any in the state with but one or two exceptions.  Mr Hawkes’ charity had extended the inscription on the window to encompass all those lads who had sacrificed their lives as well as his own son.

Mr M.A. Radford spoke for the pastoralists and said what a role model Mr Hawkes was for young men starting out at the bottom rung of the ladder.

Mr F. Treloar spoke for the residents of Burra.

The Mayor then presented a beautifully illustrated address drawn up by Mr George Hann.

Mr Hawkes’ Response

He was humbled by the honours showered upon him.  He was both proud and humbled.  Proud to have been able to live among people of good purpose and great loyalty to the Empire and humbled by the awareness of so much undone that should or could have been done.  He was happy to accept the beautiful address.

He had come to Koonoona first in February 1880 and had stayed about 2½ years before going to the River Darling.  He returned to Burra in 1889, though he had remained in touch.  He referred to his marriage in 1887 as repairing some defect in his life.  Looking back over fifty years he referred to two outstanding doctors, Sangster & Brummitt, preceded he believed by Drs Cave, Nesbitt and Dashwood.  To Dr Brummitt the town owed much of its foliage.  The legal profession was represented by the upright and just Daniel Packard and the Beau Brummell of the town Mr Akhurst who later went to Mt Gambier.  He thought that then Mr Hall managed the Bank of Australasia and Mr Rosman the National Bank, though Mr Hall was a bit hazy.  The two stock firms were then Liston, Shakes & Co. and Goodchild & Duff.  Although the Hon. John Lewis was the power behind Liston, Shakes & Co. his name did not then appear.  Mr Duff, the resident representative of his firm was of military appearance like a Colonel of the Lancers.  He recalled a match for £50 between Duff & Lewis for a drive to Kapunda – he believed it took c. 4 hours.1  The Corporation officers were Mr Bartholomaeus as Town Clerk followed by Mr Davey, father of the present Clerk – both thorough and exact.  J.R. Gray was the Inspector – he would ‘meet one in the street, touch his hat, ask after your health, hand you a summons for some stray horse or cow and leave you with the benediction – ‘God Bless You.’  Mr Coglin was the outside Ranger, a good Irishman of sporting instincts and brother to the legislator Patrick Boyce Coglin.

In Aberdeen the businessman were Messrs Ridgway, Tiver & Roach – all British to the core.

Bath & Pearce in Kooringa occupied the premises where Mr Allen now lives.  Mr Lipsett had a progressive drapery.  He was very tall and wore a tall hat making him even taller and was spotlessly attired.  Mr Wilkinson was where the shop still stands.  He was a good botanist who co-operated with Dr Brummitt.  Philip Lane, saddler and ironmonger nearby was of punctilious courtesy and affability.  Drew & Co. founded the present business of Drew & Crewes.  Its members were John, Charles and Thomas Drew.  Pearces there were in legion.  Also Thomas Parks and C.L. Williams who was, I think, in partnership with Mr Builder.  Jimmy Doe the hairdresser, Mr Walker the Bootmaker across the street where tailoring is now carried on.  Mr Walker did well under great physical disability.  The two leading hotels were run by brothers Richardson and E.C. Lockyer the brewer was a courtly gentleman with a white waistcoat and a heavy gold chain.  Messrs Rosewall, Pat Lalley, Bill Rodda, the Fitzgeralds and the Tobins were less prominent, but equally honourable.  Mr Wilson the hospital porter was a veteran soldier.2  The farmers of the district were represented by the good names of Flower, Humphrys, Escott, Dew, Bailey, Field, Finch, McWaters, Duldig, William Heinrich, Gillett, Collins, Fairchild, Oates, Peak, etc.  Pastoralists of note included Alexander McCulloch of Princess Royal and wider interests.  Mr Thomas Warnes who lived near him had eastern interests as well.  The Austins held Ketchowla, managed and subsequently owned by W. Dearlove.  Henry Dawson, retired saddler, owned Caroona, Joseph Ford had Sturt Vale and Henry Scott owned Quondong and later Braefoot.  There were Thomas, John & William Cockrum of great courage and integrity, the Killicoats – Captain & his sons Philip and William.  William Barker had Baldina and J.M. McBride owned The Gums and Pine Valley.  The Riggs held Mullaby and Murkaby while there was also John Bagg and Richard Berryman of Springbank, Mr Gebhardt of Mackerode and Markaranka on the Murray.  The Bowmans owned Wandillah and acquired Mt Bryan Station about that time from Mr Gilbert.  John Dow managed Gum creek for the Duncans and John Armstrong managed Booborowie for the Brownes.  John Sandland managed Koonoona for Mr Duffield and Mr Richard Reed.

It was not a surprise that the sons of such men responded so robustly to the call of Empire in 1914.

He was glad to be leaving the Burra Hospital with a splendid Board of Management.  He was optimistic that they would get through the present hard times.  He thanked them all for their wonderful farewell.

Musical items were interspersed throughout the evening.

[1 V. 260 (2). 31 August 1883, Page 2

J.F. Duff & J. Lewis arranged a trotting match in the past week.  Mr Duff conceded an eight-mile start to Mr Lewis’s pair and a handicap of 3cwt in the trap.  Mr Lewis accomplished his distance, Sod Hut to Kapunda, in 3 hrs 45 mins, starting at 6.00 a.m.

Mr Duff’s pair refused to trot till Marrabel and so he was completely out of contention and he reached Kapunda at 11.15 a.m., having made a 15 minute stop at Waterloo and another at Marrabel, as well as 30 minutes at Hamilton.  He covered the 48 miles in 4 hrs, not including stops.

2 William Reed Wilson born 10 May 1831 St Albans England: died 19 July 1919

Entered 49th Foot Regiment 1 Nov 1848 and served for 6 years 83 days.   He saw service at Alma Sebastopol and Inkerman in the Crimean War.  Wounded the day before charge of Light Brigade and later discharged as a result.  Arrived in Australia in 1864 in the "Duchess of Northumberland”.]
