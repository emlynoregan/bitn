Kooringa News, 21 March

On Friday evening Messrs Cole, Lennon and Dale met the electors for the last time before the election.  They were most flatteringly received.

J.W. Macdonald SM, the Returning Officer for the District of Burra and Clare, attended the Burra Hotel on 19 March and opened the letters containing nominations of the various candidates: Messrs Kingston, Cullen, Browne, Dale, Lennon and Cole.

St Maryâ€™s Sunday School held its annual tea-feast, at which some 70-80 children assembled for tea and cake.  Rev. Ibbetson distributed suitable prizes in the evening.  He put a great decrease in the number of scholars down to the lack of teachers.
