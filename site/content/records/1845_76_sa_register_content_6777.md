18 June

James Middleton was charged with letting his pigs run at large in the streets of Redruth.  He said he owned no pigs.  PC Rogers said he had seen the pigs at large and watched them enter Mr Middleton’s sty in Aberdeen.  Mr Middleton’s servant girl had said they belonged to Mr Middleton.  Mr Middleton said he kept no servant girl.  The case was dismissed and a fresh summons was issued in the name of Mr Middleton’s son, who lived at Aberdeen with his father.

William Hawkins appeared to answer the summons of Turton Diprose for an injury caused by his ferocious dog.  It was settled out of court.

Mr Madden appeared in answer to a summons by Mr Bruce [sic: perhaps M.J.H. Bruse?], cabinetmaker, who was demanding the price of a coffin ordered by the defendant for a poor women who died in Kooringa some time since.

Mr Madden had already lost £6 on this sad case because the husband of the deceased had absconded soon after his wife’s death.  Mr Bruce now wanted £4 for the coffin.

His Worship, who had previously suggested that a subscription should be got up to cover the funeral expenses, said it was hard that Mr Madden should now be charged with an additional cost.  He undertook to bring the case before the Government and would try to get some assistance in the matter.  He also suggested they approach Mr Kingston.  He had no doubt, that properly handled, such an approach would meet with a favourable reception.  Mr Kingston had already earned praise for his charitable assistance to the widow of a man lately killed at the mine.  He had sent her a cheque for £5 and he was creditably informed the same gentleman had sent a cheque for £10 to the benefit of the three orphan children of William Box, who had died in the recent flood.  Sergeant-Major McCulloch confirmed that this was so; Captain Roach had come to him before handing over the cheque to confirm the story that the police were holding £400 of Box’s money.  This statement and that saying that Box had owned cottages in the town had appeared in the Register, but were incorrect.

[See the Register of 23 December 1850, page 3 where the death of Bridget Patterson on 17 December 1850 is reported.]

Alexander Middleton was charged with keeping four pigs at large in Redruth.  Middleton said he owned no pigs and Martha Buchanan, who had previously identified Mr Middleton as the owner, now said she was mistaken in that.  There being no other evidence, the charge was dismissed.
