The Burra Flimsies

[Thomas Anslow of Kooringa writes to defend the tradesmen of the town against the suggestion that they may be issuing notes that will not be honoured. And is especially offended that it was suggested that some would set out to victimise the people of Kooringa.  Anslow can show receipts for £140 on account of the wooden store that stands near Buzz’s place.  Would someone have done this and now be erecting an expensive stone store if they had intended to victimize the citizens of Kooringa?

At the same time he does admit that the present system uses a currency that is ‘flimsy’ and seems ready to endorse the suggestion that the SA Mining Association should issue small notes; which he thinks the superintendents would happily do if instructed by the directors.]

[Thomas Pickett]
