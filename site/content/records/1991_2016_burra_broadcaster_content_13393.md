Council Voting.  Councils that chose postal voting achieved much higher participation rates than those who relied on polling booths.  43 of 54 councils chose postal voting and they averaged a 39.6% turn-out.  11 of the 54 chose polling booths and they averaged 15% turn-out.  Last election Burra Burra DC achieved a 47% poll and the turn-out this time for Goyder was 63.8%.
