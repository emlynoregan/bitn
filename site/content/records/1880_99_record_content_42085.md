Burra Town Council, 17 August.

The Mayor reports that the Waterworks boiler has been repaired and is back in place and pumping has been resumed.  He recommends that prior to the current lease’s expiry at the end of the year it is advisable for there to be an additional boiler and working gear for the engine so as to prevent inconvenience in case of breakdown or accident.

Tree planting has been energetically pursued.

The Government has decided to accede to the request to build a bridge at the Bon Accord ford.  A letter was read from the Commissioner of Crown Lands that the Treasurer had agreed to grant £1,500 for the erection of an iron bridge at the Bon Accord crossing without taking any of the Main Road Grant.

May Bros. & Co. report that the boiler of the Waterworks has been repaired and is in a fair condition.  The defect is discussed and they recommend a second boiler as a standby.
