In future there would be no call on guarantors, only a charge on water.

Kapunda did not pay working expenses.

Port Pirie and Port Augusta paid 1% interest.

Hawker paid no interest.

If the Government shifted the pump to their well a person would have to be appointed to read meters and keep accounts and the Railway Department would probably not allow anyone to pump their water.

T.W. Rabbich felt if they gave the works to the Government or if the works were amalgamated then the Government would lay down mains and levy a water rate to the detriment of those not needing water and to the poor.

The Mayor said in Mount Gambier, where the mains were laid, there was a rate on vacant land.  The Town Clerk thought it unlikely the Government would add more mains.
