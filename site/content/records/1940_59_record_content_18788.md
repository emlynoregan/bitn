H.H. Brown Distress Appeal Meeting

A meeting in Burra Council Chambers on 7 September discussed ways to assist the family which lost everything in a recent fire.  It was well attended and many returned soldiers were among those at the meeting chaired by the Mayor.  A committee was appointed to oversee the appeal.  Committees already established will co-operate with this committee.  [There was a Leighton & Gum Creek Committee.]  Subscriptions will be acknowledged in The Record.
