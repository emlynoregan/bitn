Burra & District Motor Ambulance.

A public meeting was held Tuesday last week to formulate a scheme to raise money for a Military Motor Ambulance.  The Mayor opened the meeting, saying his appeal in the paper had elicited no response.  He understood the ambulance would cost c. £550.

Cr Lane moved that a movement be inaugurated.  Carried.

Mr Lane was elected Secretary.  A committee was established.

A meeting was called for 8 March and all local patriotic societies are asked to send a representative and also the Friendly Societies.  Mr Horner suggested a time limit to hurry things up.

Subscriptions to date: £19-14-5.
