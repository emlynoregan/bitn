Ten O’clock Closing of Hotels was introduced on 28 September, bringing to an end the 6 p.m. closing introduced in 1916.  The change was greeted quietly at Burra where hotel proprietors report only a slight increase in sales in the few days since the change.  Normal day trade seems not to have been affected.  On Thursday night the drinking population appeared to go from one hotel to another and a few curious non-drinkers looked in for the occasion.  Friday and Saturday nights are expected to be the busiest when things settle down.
