Jeffrey Pearce said that6-7 tons of hay had been burnt.  It was not insured.  He had met Constable Williams at the scene about 2.30 p.m.  Had seen the O’Connor children there.  Had no idea of the cause and was on good terms with the O’Connors.

The jury found that the fire was accidentally caused by William O’Connor whilst trying to light his pipe behind the haystack unknown to his sister.
