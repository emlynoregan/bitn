Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co. has decided to sink a shaft near St Mary’s Church as high-grade ore was found when the foundations were being dug some years ago.  Thomas Rosewall and W. Harris are engaged in the work which has got to 11’.  After a few feet they will begin a drive eastwards towards the church.
