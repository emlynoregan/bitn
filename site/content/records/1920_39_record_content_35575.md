Mt Tiddy was given a farewell on Monday morning at Mr Frank Harris’s restaurant in Kooringa by residents and businessmen.  The Mayor Mr A.B. Riggs presided.  He said Mr Tiddy had been a familiar businessman among them for 42 years and was a well-known figure on his bicycle and at tennis and bowls despite his 70-odd years.  Mr Dane referred to Mr Tiddy’s conversion from tennis to bowls at 72 and spoke of his constant attendance at choir practice, singing with a fine tenor voice.

P.L. Rosman spoke for the Bowling Club.  Edgar Pearce spoke for the Kooringa Methodist Choir where he had been greatly appreciated ‘and but for his accident some three years ago he would have still been in his old place at Kooringa.’

[He was struck by a car driven by R. Fuss while riding his bicycle in Market Square.]

W.J.C. Ewins had worked with Mr Tiddy 42 years earlier at Bath & Pearce’s.  A.L. Walker also supported the above sentiments.  The Mayor handed over a wallet of notes from the town and also one from Kooringa Methodism.  Mr Tiddy responded.

[R. Fuss was among a long list of people apologising for their absence.]
