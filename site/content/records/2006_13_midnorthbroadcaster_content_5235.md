Burra National Trust

Following the recent meeting members of the committee resigned en masse.  A meeting was held last week at the old Court House and a new committee was elected.  The new Chairman is Paul Marsdon [sic: for Marsson], the Vice-Chairman is Meredith Satchell, with Secretary, Jill Wilson and Treasurer, Barry Wright.

Paul Marsdon said: ‘this new committee will be open to new ideas and will ensure all members are kept informed by way of updated newsletters and on occasions open meetings for Trust members.’

Richard Hayman (16) son of Lynn Hayman nee Moreland, formerly of Burra, is one of five students taking part in the Premier’s ANZAC 90th Anniversary Tour, which left Adelaide on 14 April and returns on 28 April, visiting London, Paris and the Western Front.  Richard presented a power point presentation to the Premier’s office, which included research on a fallen soldier, Alfred Hurtle Leighton, who was a direct relative.  After a follow-up interview he was selected to go on the trip.  Hurtle Leighton was born in Burra and grew up on a farm at Booborowie.  He joined the 43rd Battalion and served for 718 days before being killed in the 3rd Battle of Ypres in October 1917 aged 23.
