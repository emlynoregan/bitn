Court.

William Edgar Jordan was fined 2/6 + fees to total £1-11-6 for a stray red cow in Market Square.

John D. Rowett of Marrabel incurred fines and costs of £8-2-0 for breaches of the Stock Diseases Act by travelling through Hundred of King without giving due notice.

James Loudan, popular manager of Booborowie Estate, is seriously ill.

William Pearce, former blacksmith and wheelwright of Commercial St, is visiting Burra after four year’s absence.  He is in business for himself as a wheelwright in Kalgoorlie WA, but on returning to WA he may take up land, as the WA Government is offering incentives for people to do so.

Mr Mark Linkson was farewelled at Court Unity on Friday.  He intends to move to Broken Hill.
