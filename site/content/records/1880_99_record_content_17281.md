Cr West moved that a footway be constructed on the west side of the main road to Aberdeen.  It was dangerous at night and would not be a very costly work.

Cr West said SAMA might give 10-15â€™ on the east side for a footway, which might be planted.  Motion carried.

Cr Coglin asked whether there was any promise from SAMA to fix guttering.

Cr West then became very disturbed and offended as a representative of SAMA and thought SAMA had been singled out.  Eventually notice was given of the matter.
