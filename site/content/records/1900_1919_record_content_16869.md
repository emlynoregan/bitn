Accident.  Last Saturday Harry Baynes was cycling in from Mongolata.  He met Mr Isaac Villis near the Baldina Creek and soon after travelling at 20 m.p.h. his machine completely collapsed and he was thrown along the ground for 10-15 yards.  He suffered severe bruising and abrasions and was rendered unconscious.  Mr Villis assisted his recovery and Baynes then insisted he was alright to walk into Burra.  He did so, pushing the bike by its back wheel (all that was salvageable) and arrived exhausted.
