Incendiarism.  Last Friday at c. 10.30 a box of shavings was set alight and drawn up against the back door of F. Harrisâ€™s shop.  The flames got a good hold on the door and shed and in a few minutes more would have been hard to quell, but they were fortunately quickly extinguished.  An inquest will be held today.
