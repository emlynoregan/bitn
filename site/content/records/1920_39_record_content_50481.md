The only private battery in operation is at New Deloraine Mine and was responsible for 10.2%.

Baldina-Mongolata GM Syndicate recently realised nearly 400oz from 41 tons and after paying battery charges was credited with Â£8-5-6 per oz.  Tailings from the above went nearly 10dwt per ton for the last 25 tons.

Recent rains did considerable damage.

Fred Lewis had several tons of ore washed away.

Wildildie Mine had an anvil, bellows etc washed away.

Several mines had several feet of water in drives.

The battery is busy.
