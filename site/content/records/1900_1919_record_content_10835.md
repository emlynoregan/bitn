The old Bible Christian Church, after many years of good service the church in East St [sic], has been sold to a local buyer; it is said for the purpose of use as a skating rink.  Vast repairs to the windows, doors and the building itself would be needed before this could happen.

[The church was not in East St, but was on the corner of Bridge Terrace and Bridge St East.]
