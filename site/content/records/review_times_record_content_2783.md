Burra’s Festival of Carols drew about 200 at the Civic Centre last Sunday.  The weather had proved too cold and wet for the event to be held at the Burra Hospital grounds.  Mrs Annie Rees played the piano.  Clarinet solos were played by BCS students Kerry Green and Joanne Baulderstone and a flute duet by Alicia Fidock and Pacquita Kuiessner [sic: for Quiessner].  Jack Kleinig was MC, Bible reading was given by Mrs Jan Letcher and Fr Eugene Kenny of St Joseph’s delivered the benediction.  About $174 was collected for the Christmas Bowl Appeal.
