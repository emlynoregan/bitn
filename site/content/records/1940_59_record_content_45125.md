Burra Races were held on Wednesday last and all receipts increased, except possibly those from the totalizator.  The gate takings were up £36 to over £200.  Bookmakers turned over £23,242.  The Totalizator receipts were £359 and the CWA luncheon raised £95.  The autumn meeting is secondary to the spring meeting, making this a very good result.  Much of the success was due to the work of President Len Boothby, Secretary R.A. Bevan and Treasurer E.R. Davey.   Andrew Tennant is the Patron.  The course was in very good order, though the weather was a little wet, mostly misty rain with one short, heavy shower.  Stanley Hawker MP presented the trophies.  The main race was the Squatters’ Handicap of £85 with a £55 trophy.  It was won by S.R. Pretty’s Robertsman ridden by P. Kelly.  [The other results are printed.]
