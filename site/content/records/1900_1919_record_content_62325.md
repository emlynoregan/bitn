Accidents.

Charles Preiss crushed his leg between his wagon and the railing of Diprose’s Bridge on Friday, breaking his leg and fearfully lacerating the limb.

Frank Pizzo, aged 18 and employed on Koo-owie, was kicked in the head by a horse at Robertstown on Sunday night.  Dr Ashton operated to remove a splinter of bone from his brain.  His condition remains unconscious and serious.
