At Redruth Court on Thursday [10 December] before Messrs M.A. Radford and E.F. Marston JPs Thomas William Sedgeman; aged 13, and Hurtle C. Allen, [a few days short of 12] were charged by M-C Johns with lighting a fire for purpose of smoking out rabbits without clearing a width of seven feet around the site of the fire.  Both children pleaded guilty.

M-C Johns stated that the boys had explained to him that they went to the engine house a little distant from Morphett’s Shaft to smoke out rabbits.  They gathered some manure and lighted it away from the ground floor, covering the fire with bags to make the smoke go under the floor.  No rabbits came out and they went away.  At the mine pool they looked back and saw the fire spreading, and noticing a resident they ran away.  This was about 11.30 a.m. on Saturday.  Some of the residents saw the fire but none thought it advisable to advise the Police or Fire Brigade.  If active steps had been taken the property would have been saved.  When one of the poppet heads was alight at the bottom a man threw three buckets of water on it, but as it did not go out, did not trouble any further.

After consideration the Bench convicted the boys, they come up for sentence when called upon.
