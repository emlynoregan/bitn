Kooringa News, 12 June

When Messrs W. Everard MP & Mr H. Bright MP as members of the Central Road Board arrived in Burra as part of a tour of inspection, a few leading inhabitants decided to wait on them.  [A list is printed.]

Captain Killicoat introduced the deputation and said they were far from satisfied with the state of the main lines of road near Burra.  Firstly in the Sod Hut Ranges money had been appropriated to make the road in 1865, but nothing had been done.  He did not blame the Board, but their surveyor Mr Macaulay.  Also the road between Burra and Sod Hut was disgracefully formed.  Instead of a crown in the centre of the road there was a hollow.  Spoon drains had been made instead of culverts – equally expensive, but not nearly so effectual.  The road, though newly laid, was almost as bad as before it was metalled – a fact he attributed to a poor foundation.

Mr Dawson corroborated Captain Killicoat’s statements and also referred to the dangerous crossing known as Thomas’s Gap about two miles north of Kooringa, which would be totally impassable in winter.

Mr John Roberts, Mr William Pearce and Mr O. Harvey spoke at some length in support.  Mr Bright said in reply that he felt Mr Macaulay had not been fairly treated and was not so much to blame as had been stated.

The road through the Sod Hut Ranges would have been completed, but for the absurd amount of compensation demanded by Mr Broad, through whose property it would pass.  He wanted £5 per acre instead of the £3 offered and also £150 for the removal of a sheep yard and brush fencing.  The road would be gazetted in about a week and work begun immediately.  With reference to the piece of road near the Mine Store, they had instructed the Surveyor to commence a bridge across the mine watercourse there at once, which would be on the same level as the road recently made.  [The Mine Bridge.]  They had ordered a watertable be made on the western side of Commercial Street.  Work on the Thomas’s Gap would be done as soon as possible.  When about fifty unemployed men waited upon the Commissioners, seeking work, they were told twenty could start work raising and breaking metal on Monday morning.

Sunday was Whit Sunday and the Bible Christian Sunday-school Anniversary was held.  Rev. W. Allen, the local minister, preached morning and evening and in the afternoon Rev. Jarrett, the Primitive Methodist Minister gave the address.  On Monday the children had tea and cakes and an adult tea meeting followed.  The collections raised £32.

At the Sunday afternoon service an unfortunate accident occurred to a temporary gallery erected for the children’s accommodation at the end of the chapel.  During a hymn one of the boards broke and the boys and a teacher on it fell to the ground.  The girls heard a crash and cries of alarm and they in turn screamed and surged forward down the tiers to the bottom, endangering limbs in the panic.  The panic spread to the congregation, some of whom rushed outside.  Fortunately the office bearers managed to calm things down and were able to assure everyone that there had been no serious injuries and after much trouble the service was resumed from the point of interruption.

A new cobalt mine has been opened lately and a company formed in Burra with £1,000 capital – half a crown paid up.  With this the Directors will raise five tons of ore and send it to England to decide on the venture’s viability.

The Princess Royal Mine continues to look well with 14 men working 7 pitches.  One pair calculated they earned £50 for nine days’ work.

Mr Dutton MP and Mr Tomkinson visited the adjoining Dutton’s Square Mile last week to inspect a continuation of the lodes and it is possible these too could be developed.

The proposed railway remains a prime topic of discussion and the farmers continue to lament the closure of the mine.  Nearly 200 are employed in the creek dressing low grade ore, but the labour market is still very full, with many idle.
