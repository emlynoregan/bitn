Burra Town Council, 4 February

T. Halls & Alex Bevan asked for a continuation in the reduction of licence fees as in recent years.  Granted.

W. Marshall, through his solicitors, sought the support of the Council in his efforts to get the Aberdeen Ballast Quarry re-opened.

The Mayor said he understood the Railway Commissioner had said it was cheaper to get metal at Yatala and that metal from Sleep’s Hill was being used as far north as Hallett if not Terowie.   This was a shame with such excellent ballast at hand from Aberdeen Quarry.  If it were used the quarry would employ a number of men.  Mr Marshall the lessee had received no orders from the Government.

Cr Kellaway said he knew what had been done at the quarry in the past.  Unfortunately owing to local jealousy and petty quibbling (he was not here referring to Mr Marshall) the Government had found the easiest way out was to close their dealings with the quarry.  The Council by backing this appeal would be doing a good thing and the SAR should be asked to procure at least a portion of their ballast from the Aberdeen Quarry.

Cr Sampson supported this, as did Crs Jennison & Jeffery.  The latter was inclined to think someone was benefiting [improperly] from the arrangements in place especially when Mr Marshall had told the railways he could supply the metal at the same price as Sleep’s Hill.  When SAR said it was a nuisance to have to shunt to the quarry Mr Marshall had offered to put it on trucks at the station, but that too was turned down.  With Cr Riggs support as well, the motion was carried unanimously.

Cr Jeffery said every time the Burra Band played at Aberdeen it took about three hours before the concert to fix the necessary lights.  Council could assist by installing a plug.  It was resolved that North Ward Councillors interview Bandmaster Murison to see what was required and report back at the next meeting.
