Burra FFCF held its first AGM last Tuesday.  Mrs A. Tennant reported for the year.

The unit began at a Red Cross meeting and the Red Cross has kindly allowed the use of the room in conjunction with them.  The RSL is sponsoring the FFCF.

Burra North has also formed a circle registered with us and they have a membership of 110.

The RSL Wives Group was originally formed up with us, but has since registered separately.

At the Anzac Sports in conjunction with the two other FFCF circles and the RSL we raised £494.

We have also raised £104-13-5 with the help of Burra Burra Show War Committee, CWA, Bence’s Ltd, the Burra Racing Club, the Buffalo lodge & other donors.

With Burra North we have sent 25 Xmas parcels to men overseas.

Mrs Ganley reported they had made up and forwarded 227 pairs of socks, 101 pairs of mittens, 75 mufflers, 34 pullovers, 98 handkerchiefs and 42 dilly bags.

Mrs Les Pascoe reported for the Burra North Circle.

The Pet Show resulted in £51-18-11 being sent to Headquarters.  Dances in the Lodge Hall have added to the Diggers’ Cupboard Fund.  Miss Clarice Reed reported sending off 294 pairs of socks, 49 mufflers, 13 helmet scarves, 44 pullovers, 18 pairs of mittens, 48 handkerchiefs and 2 caps.
