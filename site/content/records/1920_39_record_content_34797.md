RSL farewelled W.G. Hawkes at the club rooms on Saturday 28 June.

President H.G. Oates gave a speech in appreciation of Mr Hawkes and especially of his work for the community and his generosity financially in many projects.  Dr Steele supported the chairman’s remarks.  Other speakers were: L.M. Gordon, G.H. Dow, J. Thomas, W.D. Thompson & J.E. Hogan.

The president presented Mr Hawkes with a pipe.

Mr Hawkes responded with a notably patriotic speech in support of the stand taken in the war, the British Empire and British culture.  He related stories of the patriotic appeals in Burra during the war and of the work of E.W. Crewes.  He was asked for some words of advice.  He urged industry and thrift, but thrift was not meanness.  ‘The meanest person was he or she who dissipated all they earned.  They could never help others, and finally had to receive help.’
