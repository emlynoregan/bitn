Burra National Trust will host visitors from the Adelaide Branch at the weekend.  The visitors will tour Burra’s historic places and be entertained at a buffet tea on Saturday evening (courtesy of the CWA).  Work has started on repairs to the back rooms of the Museum and it is hoped these will be ready and in use before the visitors arrive.  From February to mid-May 400 persons signed the visitors’ book and besides these there are many who did not sign.  Mr Bayfield of Spalding has completed repairs to the pack saddles and the camel saddle given to the Branch.
