The Season.  The 2006-07 harvest was meagre.  In many districts of SA it was worse than in 1982.  Around Burra it was a disaster â€“ perhaps 20-30% of normal and around Jamestown perhaps 40%.  Shortage of feed means more time, energy and money to support livestock too.  Summer weeds had also been a problem, with caltrop and potato weed prevalent in the Booborowie area.
