Redruth Court.

James McDonald of the Kooringa Hotel was charged with supplying a lad under the age of 16, named Callahan, with 2 bottles of beer.  There was evidence however, that although the lad had drunk some of the beer and actually carried it, the beer had been bought by Mr Luke Halls.  McDonald was given the benefit of the doubt and a further similar charge involving Stanley Warner was withdrawn.

Luke Halls was then charged with sending a boy under 16 to get beer and was fined Â£5 plus costs.
