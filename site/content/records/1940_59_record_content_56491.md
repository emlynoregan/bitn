Burra Races.  The charity meeting to aid the Burra Hospital Building Fund was held last Wednesday in bad weather with high winds and rain.  Unfortunately the rain did not meet the requirements to collect insurance payouts.  Acceptances were also poor and in the Hospital Handicap with stake money of Â£100 there were only four entrants.  The CWA ladies provided a splendid luncheon.  The track was in good order and the whole event was well organised, but it seems unlikely that the Hospital will benefit to any great extend, if at all.  [Results are printed on page 8.]
