Burra Hospital

Mrs Lesley Phillips has been appointed acting CEO with help from Clare Hospital on an ‘as needed’ basis, for an interim period of six months.

Mrs Cathy McPherson will take over as Director of Nursing.  In the longer term consideration is being given to combining both roles with a consultant CEO from Clare Hospital as support.

The AGM on 30 August was well attended.

Mr John Brak, Mrs Judy Kellock and Mr Ron Thamm were elected as community consumer members.  Mr Gordon Wooton was thanked for his five years of valued service to the board.  Mr Brak was re-elected Chairman, with Mrs Colleen Woodgate as Vice-Chair.
