Burra Branch of the National Trust held its AGM last Friday.  Special guests were the new Director of the Trust, Reiner Jozeps; and from Central Deborah Bendigo the President/Director, Dennis O’Hoy and the General Manager, James Thompson.

Mr Jozeps said there were 50 National Trust branches in the state and 280 sites in Australia, of which 148 were in SA.

Dennis O’Hoy, who is descended from a Chinese family that came to Bendigo in the gold rush days, gave a talk on the work of the Central Deborah and illustrated it with slides.

James Thompson gave a talk on the business side of the Central Deborah operations in Bendigo.

President of the Burra Branch, Maureen Wright, gave her annual report.  It is now two years since the branch decided to become more involved in tourism in Burra by leasing the remaining Burra Passport sites from the (then) District Council and taking over the management of Morphett’s Engine House and the Burra Visitor Centre.  Since then volunteers have put in a wonderful effort as site managers and on the executive.  Some members have taken on paid jobs, giving more time than they are paid for.

1997/98 was a financial burden for the branch, but one for which it had planned.  The last year has seen a turn-around in finances with all sites making a special effort to curb expenditure and with the Visitor Centre performing well.  Thanks go to Manager Janelle Cousins.  The trust has developed a good working relationship with the Goyder Council    and other community bodies.  The membership list of about 70 is an indication of our support.

In the future the branch and town will become involved with Flinders University through the school of Archaeology and Cultural Tourism and a professional diving school will be using the Mine Pool for training.  There will also be Trust involvement in celebrations for the Centenary of Federation and d the Festival of Arts Regional Events program.
