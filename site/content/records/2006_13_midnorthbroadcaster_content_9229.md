Weather.  The heavy rain across the region over the weekend has been a disaster for many farming areas.  It will cost the state millions in lost production.  The monthâ€™s average rainfall fell in three days.  The rain will also see the growth of pest weeds.  Up to this rain the year had been looking pretty good.
