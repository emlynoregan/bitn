Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co.  There are many rumours circulating.  It is said:

Directors have decided to pump the water from the open cut.

A decision has been made to erect machinery to treat the ore.

That men will be put on to ascertain the quantity of ore in sight.

The pumping it is said will be done by a man who guarantees to drain the mine in less than six weeks with machinery left there for continuous use.  An old miner tells us that when the mine closed hundreds of tons of blue carbonates were in the site and could be found again if the water were lowered.  Even recent tributers have found good ore below water level, but have had to abandon further work due to the inrush of water.  On Saturday the directors intend to visit the mine to inspect shafts etc. before deciding on the best steps to take.
