I expect there was great excitement in Burra when news of the capturing of the Emden arrived â€“ there was here.

On the Sydney three men were killed and three wounded we were told.

There will be no leave in Colombo when we arrive.

There is not enough room on board for much exercise.

The weather turns meals bad and there is little to eat at times, but then in this weather no one wants much.
