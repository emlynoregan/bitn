The Red Cross and FFCF Shop will close at the end of October.  It opened on 24 April 1942 and has since raised nearly £1,000, all of which has been devoted to patriotic purposes.

The 5 & 12 October will be the last days on which it will be staffed by members of the Burra Red Cross and FFCF.  The CWA will staff the shop on 19 October and the Soldiers’ Welfare Group on 26 October.  The total sum raised to date is £995-5-6 and so it should be easy to reach the £1,000 mark next Friday.  Many thanks are due to Mrs J. Kellock, who has been in charge almost from the start.  Now the war is ended there is not the need for so much fund-raising and members have decided to close the shop and make way for private enterprise.

[The shop operated from the premises of C.L. Phillips in Commercial Street and its provision of competition to other businesses, without of course their overheads, did not pass without controversy: see Vol. 63, 14 (2), 10 November 1942, page 4.]
