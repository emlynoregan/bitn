Maureen & Barry Wright have just returned from taking part in the ‘Source to the Sea’ Federation trip along the Murray.  They were combining this with work to update their book ‘River Murray Charts’ and this meant they had to move on ahead of the main flotilla.  They will have to return to negotiate the section around Mildura where the water was too low to negotiate.
