The meeting had to decide which recommendations for the celebration of the Centenary of federation would go forward to SA State Planning for funding.  It has been recommended to the Goyder Planning Group that the celebration be a themed weekend in October or November 2001.  It will include a history performance by the Burra Community School, a Walk of Fame in either the Market Square or Town Hall footpaths, a maypole recreation of the 1901 celebrations, the re-launching of the Burra Town Hall, a youth art prize with joint funding from businesses and a the grant, the unveiling of the to-be conserved portrait of Sir F.W. Holder, the opening of the Senior Citizens Centenary of federation Emblem Garden in Burra creek reserve and a community picnic.
