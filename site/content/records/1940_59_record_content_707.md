Burra Town Council, 19 February.

Cricket Club given permission to play at Victoria Park on Sundays as long as they finish by 5.30 p.m.

Burra Progress Assoc. enquired if the Council was attending to cleaning up the streets and the cemetery.

[As usual the council took umbrage at someone suggesting that they were not on top of everything.]

The overseer reported that the cemetery had been cleaned up in the last week and little remained to be done.

Town Civil Defence Committee advised of its membership and said the resignation of G. Powell left a vacancy, which Council could fill, giving them 4 members of the 9.

The mayor said he knew little of their activities and never received an invitation to attend, though the list supplied gave him as a member.  Also E.J. Davey was not on it as a Council representative and Mr Bednall was not a Councillor, so he did not know where they got their idea of 4 Council representatives.

Cr Robinson moved the Committee be invited to meet with Council.  Carried.

J.E. Pearce was given permission to build a house on the site of F. Pledgeâ€™s blacksmith shop.

The Town Clerk said a letter from the Swimming Pool Committee agreeing to hand over their funds would arrive by the next meeting.
