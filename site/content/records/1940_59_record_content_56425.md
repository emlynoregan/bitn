On the subject of a Christmas carnival the Buffalo Lodge indicated it could run a Christmas Tree.  It was suggested 6.30-8.30 p.m. on Saturday 20 December, followed by the Carnival.  This was accepted.  It was suggested pictures be shown on Friday 19 December so as not to clash with the Carnival, to their mutual advantage.
