Editorial on Christmas.  There are some passing references to the political and social troubles – mainly in other states – plus the usual platitudes.

The Leighton Christmas Tree will be given on Christmas Night in the new hall to the pupils of Leighton School by Mr & Mrs I.J. Warnes.

Kooringa Methodist Church’s annual hospital service last Sunday raised £4-10-0 for the hospital.

Mt Bryan Hall will be opened by H.S. Stephen, Chairman of the Mt Bryan DC, on 23 February next.

Christmas Charity.  Drew & Crewes have received £3-3-0 from Mr Dearlove of Ketchowla and a similar amount from J.M. McBride of Kooringa, to buy Christmas cheer for the poor.

St Joseph’s.  Bishop Norton of Port Augusta visited Burra on Sunday and conducted Mass at St Joseph’s and also at Mt Bryan.  A strong committee has been formed to reduce the local church debt.
