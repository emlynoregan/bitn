Burra Visitor Numbers are up compared with the previous three years.

In January to March 3,838 went through the Visitor Centre compared with 3,100 in 2001, 3,090 in 2000 and 2,824 in 1999.  Word of mouth is reported to be the most common way they found out about Burra.  While many find the Heritage Trail the highlight, others are attracted to the Cemetery Tour, Artists and Antiques Trail, Ryan’s Deer Farm, the Cider cellars and Burra Trail Rides.  The surrounding attractions of Burra Creek Gorge, Mongolata Gold Mines and Redbanks Conservation Park are also proving popular.
