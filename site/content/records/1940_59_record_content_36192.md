Mid North Local Government Association held its half-yearly meeting at Tanunda on 22 March.

Guest speakers Mr S.E. Huddlestone (Development Engineer) and F.W. Tideman of ETSA spoke on the present electrical system and the impact of constructing a power station at Pt Augusta to use Leigh Creek Coal.  Plans have been made, but construction will wait on the availability of manpower and materials.

Among many topics of interest to ratepayers were:

The need for more petrol for country people.

The urgency of making all dairy herds supplying milk for human consumption free of tuberculosis.

One aspect of that drive was the need for more veterinary graduates.

There were also complaints about the increasing cost of the Commonwealth Public Service and the proposed increase in the number of members of the Federal Parliament, along with a more generous superannuation scheme for retired members.
