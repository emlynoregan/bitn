Lieut. L.H. Thomas has been awarded the Military Cross.  Before the war he was a popular local singer, grazier and leader of the Redruth Methodist Church Choir.  He won quick promotion and gained his commission on the battlefield.  He saw service in the Mediterranean area where he was wounded in the arm.  He rejoined his unit for the attack on El Alamein where he won the MC.  There he made night patrols into no-manâ€™s-land and in the attack that followed was seriously wounded in the legs.  He has since been recovering and we hear is showing considerable improvement.
