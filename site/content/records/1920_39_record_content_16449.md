Obituary.  James H. Gallagher died at Aberdeen 14 July.  He was born at Kooringa 19 August 1861, the eldest son of the late Mr & Mrs Edward Gallagher.  He began as a dam sinker and about 30 years [ago?] bought Pualco Station about 80 miles east.  He survived drought etc. successfully and in 1903 bought Quondong and later Drayton Stations.  He was a keen supporter of all sports.  For many years he was President of the Burra Racing Club and the Burra Sporting & Athletic Club.  He was on the Burra Show Committee.  He was very generous in patriotic efforts during the war and saw that the Burra Sporting & athletic Club gave Â£5 to each returning soldier of the district.  He made the first moves towards establishing the Eastern Telephone System, though drought intervened and it was I.J. Warnes that carried the scheme through.  His determination was behind the Burra Electric Supply Co.  In 1887 he married Miss C. Terry, daughter of W. Terry of Copperhouse who survives with four sons: James (Adelaide), George (Pualco), Leonard & William (Quondong & Drayton).  There are 7 grandchildren.  One son, Bert, was killed in the Great War and his only daughter Hilda Gallagher died in 1915.
