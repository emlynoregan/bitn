Ian Auhl was born in Burra in 1914 and developed an abiding interest in the preservation of the architectural heritage of this historic mining town when he returned to Burra as Principal of Burra Primary School.  He became deeply involved in moves to acquire and preserve the town’s historic buildings and has researched, written and lectured extensively on the history of the area.  He is an Associate of the University of Adelaide and has been a member of the Council of the National Trust of SA.  Mr Auhl now lives in Modbury and since his retirement has written a history of the District of Tea Tree Gully, commissioned by the Corporation of the City of Tea Tree Gully.  In 1975 Ian Auhl and Denis Marfleet produced a widely acclaimed book Australia’s Earliest Mining Era, South Australia 1841-51, which incorporated the paintings of S.T. Gill.  He is married with two children and five grandchildren.
