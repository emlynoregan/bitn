The State Finances.  There is a long article reporting Sir David Gordonâ€™s address in the Legislative Council.  Despite rising revenue during a three year run of good seasons and expanding industrial development the rate of increase in expenditure had been much greater leaving a heavy deficit for the Government.  The Government had planned to pay off this debt over 52 years.  They now planned to effect economies and curtail non-paying services.  In the railways freight charges and fares would rise.  Water costs would have to rise.  In the last seven years loans have risen 70% and population by 18 %.  The interest bill had doubled as had state taxation.  Other states will soon confront similar conditions.
