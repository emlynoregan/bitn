Goyder Council has called a public meeting on 6 July in the Burra sports Complex to discuss the communityâ€™s attitude towards reported anti-social behaviour in Burra at night and to consider what options might be available to improve the situation.  At the June Council meeting Councillors met with Senior Sergeant Gerry Nicholson from Pt Pirie and Senior Constable Andrew dredge of Burra and heard from Mr Don Schultz, Manager of the Burra Caravan Park, since much of the problem behaviour has been in the area of the Caravan Park and Thomas Pickett Reserve.
