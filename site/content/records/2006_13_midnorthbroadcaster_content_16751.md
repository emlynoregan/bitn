In 2003 a barbecue area was added and opened on the 80th anniversary of the hall.

Stage lighting has been added and the supper room acoustics improved in 2010.

The hall is now owned by the Regional Council of Goyder. And the exterior was repainted in 2012.

An annual strawberry fete in November raised money for maintenance.
