Fire.  A very destructive fire this morning completely destroyed the store room and shop of W.H. Stanbury.  It was discovered at about 4 a.m. and by 5 a.m. all was gone.  The adjourning surgery of Dr Maurau, a wooden building, was also consumed.  Dr Maurau’s house was saved with difficulty – wet blankets being laid on the roof and along with other efforts the struggle was successful.

The National Bank was in grave danger; the windows next to the store were completely burnt, their glass melting and running like water.  Mr Wilkinson the manager and Mr McKeevor the police-trooper strove to prevent the fire entering the bank and though they were successful, the stairs etc. were so hot that they could not be touched.

The dead wall between the shop and Mr Stanbury’s house saved it, though the doors were burnt.  Everything was taken out of the house as a precaution.

Last week’s fire did not have an inquest as there was no loss, but here the loss cannot be less than £6,000 to £7,000 – part of which we believe to be insured.

The buildings belong to D. Bayre of Adelaide and no doubt they were insured.

Further damage was saved by the wind being from the southwest.
