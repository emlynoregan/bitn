Burra School

The drinking water in the school tanks is polluted by dead rats and pigeon manure.  Much of this comes from problems with broken ventilators on the roof and the type of guttering, which provides excellent breeding ground for rats and pigeons.  Recently it is said, when the tanks were emptied, six rats were removed and sixty-one buckets of pigeon manure were taken from one section of guttering.  Why does this continue when it would not take a great deal to put these things in order?  It is said that children were asked to go into the tanks in shorts and sand-shoes to clean them out.  Should this be so?  It w as raised at a Local Board of Health meeting recently.

The school yard is considered unsafe as a playing are and Councillors raised this continually with the Education Department.  The Department said a contract to do the work was let, but that was some considerable time ago.  Mt Bryan and Farrell Flat have bitumen paved playing areas.  Why not Burra?  The Council will again write to the Department.
