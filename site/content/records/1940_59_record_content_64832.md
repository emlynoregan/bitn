Ex-Servicemen’s Avenue on the eastern approach to Burra has 37 more trees planted by a working bee of the RSL, Demobilised Soldiers, air Force Assoc. and Fathers’ Assoc.  There are now 70 trees, all donated by Ron Murray.  A further 100 are planned. E.L. McWaters has given a strip of land in the rifle range 400 yards x 12 ft for a row of pines.  The other side will comprise a small plantation, beginning with five rows of trees and narrowing to three rows at the top of the hill.  Vern Riggs is in charge of the operations.  [A list of donors is printed.]
