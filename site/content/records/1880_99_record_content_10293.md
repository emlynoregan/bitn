The Education Question, part 3, by R.W.M.

R.W.M. wants an education limited for each grade and condition of society - ‘not necessarily for the perpetuation of class distinction’

The State, he says, cannot provide free education for all levels of society.  Those exercising rights and privileges attached to wealth and social position need a superior education the State can’t provide.  R.W.M. then goes on to consider the ‘evil effects of an indiscriminate bestowal of the suffrage.’  Education requires a very strong moral base, thus the State should ensure that the time between 13 and 21 is spent in learning some useful occupation.
