Editorial on the proposed Bon Accord Bridge.

2nd Leader querying why the Council called tenders for road metal and then awarded the contracts to those tendering at 2/3 per yard rather than those tendering at 2/1 per yard.

3rd Leader on the coming Legislative Council elections.

Elder, Smith & Co. will offer 25,370 sheep next Friday.

Shearing.  Pastoralists and shearers seem to have come to a satisfactory arrangement for the coming season.

Elder, Smith & Co. have let the tender for timber work at their new saleyards to T.R. Stubbins and the gates etc. to F.K. Sorrell and the cartage and construction has gone to C. McKennion.

Railway Refreshment!  We have sometimes heard a great deal said against the Government allowing sale of ale and porter at railway station refreshment rooms.  We think it would be a deal better than the dangerous ‘much’ [sic] now sold there under the name of wine.

Mr Snell has produced some wonderful peaches and his garden in Kooringa is producing great produce and the garden would have been an even greater area had SAMA not demanded an exorbitant rent.
