Burra Race Meeting

Last Wednesday’s race meeting was the most successful since the early 1920s.  At last the weather was favourable and the fields were good.  The track was fast.  The new President of the Club, Mr L. Boothby wore a very contented smile and all went smoothly.  To cap the enthusiasm the local owner, Mr Jim Reilly saw his horse ‘Penburst’ win the Handicap with a starting price of 33/1.  [Other results are reported.]
