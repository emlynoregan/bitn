Ernest W. Crewes JP.  A sketch of his life.

He is the managing director of Drew & Crewes Prop. Ltd. And has made his mark in Burra by being foreseeing and active.  The old firm has recently evolved into a Limited Co. with remarkable promise.  Mr Crewes has achieved this with Mr John Drew.  He is a native of Truro, Cornwall and arrived here in December 1878.  He became first a farm labourer at Mt Bryan before working for Messrs H. Gartrell & Co., storekeepers of Aberdeen, for 12 months.  He then became a deliveryman for S. Drew & Co.  Soon he was in charge of grocery and hardware.  When tin was discovered in the Barrier District of NSW he was sent to open a branch store at Eurowie.  He returned to Burra after three years and entered into partnership with John Drew jnr.  Drew & Crewes was inaugurated in 1889.  Recently branches have been opened in Mt Bryan and Hallett to go with the old stores in Kooringa and Aberdeen.  The firmâ€™s operations extend far into NSW and Queensland and throughout the north of SA.  Mr Crewes has been Mayor of Burra and a Town Councillor and for a time member of the Institute Committee.  He is a JP for SA & NSW and a member of the Masonic Lodge.  He married in 1882 and has two sons and five daughters.
