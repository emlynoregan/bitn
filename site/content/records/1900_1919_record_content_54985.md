Burra Town Council, Monday.

Christie & Gardner advise that an auxiliary electric plant would cost £131 p.a.

A battery would cost (assuming a life of six years) £400 p.a. including interest and depreciation.

Henry Roach & Sons said they couldn’t say if they would use electricity until they knew its cost.

Drew & Crewes would use electric light.

The mayor said they had not yet sufficient information to lay before ratepayers to justify calling a meeting about electric light.

Cr Radford thought that the cost would be 30% more than in normal times and therefore it would be silly to call a meeting.

The Mayor wondered if people were prepared to wait seven years or so until things got back to normal – even if the war ended tomorrow it would take years to return to normal.  He favoured going to the ratepayers.

Plans and specifications would cost £150 and before spending that it was necessary to know that ratepayers would not turn it down.  One problem about the scheme’s viability was the number of private plants that would be installed if delay went on.

Cr Dane moved that the Town Clerk write to Christie & Gardner saying that if they were prepared to run the scheme at their own risk for two years as stated by Mr Christie whilst in Burra, the Burra Council would do its best to carry out the scheme.

Carried with Cr Killicoat opposed.  He favoured getting other opinions.  He believed the proposed scheme was unreasonable.  He thought the costings for labour were absurd.

B. Bourman has been appointed lamplighter.

L.H. Foote writes re open gates at ‘The Gums’.  He asserts that the only gates left open were gates found open.  He gave the names of the alleged road hogs as L.H. Foote, H. Austin & B. Burgess and claims the reward offered for supplying the names.
