Burra Primary School held its visiting day on Friday 11 December.  Over 80 parents inspected the decorated rooms and the work on display.  After recess students sang, played musical games and performed folk dances.  Head Teacher, Mr Pattrick, addressed the parents.  It is reported that the ‘condemned cell’ at the school (condemned by the Local Board of Health) is nearly fir for human habitation again.  The school expects this year to raise about £40 from the sale of produce from the school garden.
