Redruth Court

Sam Roy Morphett was fined £1 per head, reduced to 5/- each + costs to a total of £2-4-0 for branding four cattle in the wrong position.

Daniel Horan was fined £2 or 7 days in jail for being unlawfully on the premises of the Burra Hotel on Christmas Day.

George Lord of the Burra Hotel was charged with allowing Horan on the premises during the time the sale of liquor is prohibited.  Horan’s evidence that he was refused a drink resulted in the charge being dismissed.

A charge against Henry Nourse for stealing hay from a paddock of Albert Thomas Fairchild near Booborowie was eventually dismissed.

A Bolt.  Ada McDonald, daughter of Charles McDonald, had a lucky escape from injury when the horse she was driving to meet the train at Hallett bolted and capsized the vehicle.  She escaped with a shaking.
