The Gold Fields News, per the Daphne

The gold escort to Melbourne from Mount Alexander on 27 February brought 21,000 ounces of gold.

Mr Tolmer (SA Police Commissioner) has arrived to announce a regular escort has commenced between Adelaide and the diggings.  He announced on behalf of the Government in Adelaide a price of £3-11-0 per ounce.

Although water was becoming ever scarcer the output of gold is likely to remain high, there being at least 25,000 diggers at the field.

The escort from Ballarat, arriving at Melbourne on 25 February, started with only 131 oz 8 dwt of which it left 101 oz at Geelong.

The gold price in Melbourne has been £3-1-6 to £3-2-0 per ounce.
