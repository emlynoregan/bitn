The Chief Secretary wrote warning against the Board paying unnecessary interest [on an overdraft] because the Government sent a cheque every month to meet liabilities.

Bur Mr Harcus said it often came up to 10 days after the end of the month and it would not be fair to keep staff waiting for wages.  Mr Warnes moved that accounts other than staff wages be held until the Government remittance arrived.
