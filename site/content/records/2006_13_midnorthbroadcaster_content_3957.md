Casey Cooper & Melissa Miller returned earlier this month from 12 months in Canada.  The pair worked on a small cattle ranch.  They spent the first two months working at a gas plant in Edson before moving to Calgary, Alberta, where they lived in a log cabin on a ranch and used horses to round up cows.  They had to deal with pulling calves and bedding expectant cows in a barn while the outside temperature was -45Â°.  They managed to combine their work with visits to the Rockies and other parts of British Columbia.  They have returned expecting a baby and Casey has started work again at Clare Crane Hire.
