Burra Show Soc.  AGM

The appreciation of the Society for the work of the late H.H. Thomas was recorded.

This year a major expense was the new chicken coops.  Another was the increase in prize money of £40.  On the whole the President thought they were in a sound position, though they had not made any progress financially.  He felt the town was not supporting the Society and had been quite absent from the dog trials.  The bad weather had cost c. £20 at the gate and not enough had been paid for the publican’s booth, which was worth at least £20.  Elected were

Patron	Hon. J. Lewis

President	I.J. Warnes

Needed improvements included lavatories.

Mr Warnes then donated £100 to offset the cost of the fowl coops.  He thought that a minimum price of £25 should be put on the publican’s booth.  (He said £70-£80 was paid at Jamestown.)
