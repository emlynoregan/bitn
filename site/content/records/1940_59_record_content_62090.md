E.L. McWaters purchased the 42-acre Rifle Range property for Â£25 per acre.  He said the Rifle Club would be able to carry on using the area.  The club hopes to be able to arrange a lease, which has not previously been possible.  A lease under appropriate conditions would result in Government funds being available for maintenance.
