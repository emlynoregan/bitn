Election Meeting at the Institute on 12 April with the Mayor in the chair.

Dr Cockburn had called the meeting, which about 160 people attended.

Dr Cockburn:

He repeated some of his earlier views on annexation, federation, payment of MPs, immigration, customs, duties and education.  He said he favoured perpetual leases for pastoralists.  Mineral development should be encouraged.  Local Government should be more complete with the powers now held by road boards, liquor boards and over education and irrigation for instance.  He was for the Transcontinental Railway [To Darwin].  He would abolish appeals to the Privy Council.

Mr Ridgway:

He contradicted some rumours circulating.  He was not intending to withdraw.  He had been well supported three years ago.  He was not a nominee of Mr Rounsevell and that gentleman was not paying his election expenses.  He had been called a loafer, but had earned his own living since the age of 10.  He did not desire to overthrow the Education Act, but to draw in children from out of the gutter.  He was not too old.  Some said he was not religious: he said he lay down every night at peace with God and man.  He had long favoured perpetual leases and in townships the blocks too should be open for selection and not allowed to be held by speculators for profit.

Dr Stephens:

He began by disassociating himself from the rumours about Mr Ridgway.  He went on to support federation, water conservation, amendments to the Real Property Act and an end to legal tyranny in court and the tyranny of money over the poor.  He was against the Exhibition.

Mr Rounsevell:

He spoke mainly on taxation reform.  The proposed property tax was unfair and by no means as simple or equitable as the proposers pretended.
