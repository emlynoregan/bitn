Burra Hospital Board

At the last meeting it was decided the Hospital should sponsor a community nursing service in Burra.  A sister from the Hospital Staff will be released part-time to visit people in their homes and could carry out such services as injections and changing dressings.  This would allow people to stay at home rather than staying in or visiting the hospital.
