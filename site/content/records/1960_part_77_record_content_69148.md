St Edmund’s Church of England at Booborowie celebrates its golden jubilee on 9 December.  The Bishop of Willochra Rt Rev. S.B. Rosier will preside at Holy Communion and will preach.  The celebrant will be the Rector of Burra Parish, Rev. J.H. Stephenson.  The foundation stone was laid on 5 December 1923 by Mrs A. Affolter, who with a band of helpers provided a large part of the funds needed for the building.  The nave was dedicated on 20 July 1924.  It cost $2,680 and the chancel was added at a cost of $540 in 1928.  The building was consecrated on 8 November 1929.  Before this Anglicans met in Beavan’s homestead at Booborowie for 16 years and from 1921-24 worshiped in the Memorial Hall.  Structural repairs to two places in the nave were made some years ago and a thorough external repainting is now being done.  A large attendance is expected and a basket luncheon will follow the service.  The congregation is now small due to removal after removal of Anglican families from Booborowie.
