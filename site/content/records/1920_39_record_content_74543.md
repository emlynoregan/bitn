Annual Trip to Sturt Vale Shearing, 3 April

12 cars conveyed 56 district residents to I.J. Warnes & Sons’ Sturt Vale Station on 3 April.  Recent rain made the track less dusty than usual.  The visitors were greeted by Mr Warnes and his three sons.  Before lunch the visitors took a trip to North Koomooloo to inspect the lucerne growing in the watercourse.  Some 2,000 acres are now under lucerne from 18” to 30” high and some 9,000 bales have been cut and stacked by the watercourse.  Water was flowing in the main channel.  Billy Carpenter, in charge of the food for the shearers, provided a sumptuous dinner for the visitors.  Mr Codrington, Wool Instructor for the School of Mines, gave a 20-minute talk on wool, marketing and grading.  Mr Stan Kellaway paid tribute to the work of Messrs Warnes and Sons and Mr Warnes and his son Rex responded.  The shearing shed was then visited and many questions asked of the wool-classers.  Afternoon tea followed and then a return to Burra, which was reached about 6.45 p.m.
