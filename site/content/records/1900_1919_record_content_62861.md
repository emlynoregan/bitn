Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting (Continued from last issue.)

Cr McBride said he had not had an entirely pleasant time.  He considered a new and higher assessment was needed, but had been overruled and much of the increase of £500 seems to have been on his properties:

Pearce’s Store rose from £46 to £56

Hunt’s rose from £26 to £30

Broderick’s rose from £30 to £35,

While R.D. Pascoe with about the same frontage was unchanged.

Drew & Crewes, despite improvements, only rose from £195 to £200, while Elder’s and Ewins were unaltered.  Mr Winnall’s garage rose from £25 to £35.  His outside blocks went from £10 to £20 and the slaughterhouse property from £17 to £25.

The mayor elect and Councillors then occupied the platform.

Mr Lane regretted the lack of interest in the Council elections.  At 11 a.m. on nomination day there had been no candidates for West Ward.  He would do all he could to help the town as Mayor.

Cr Radford thanked the ratepayers for his re-election.
