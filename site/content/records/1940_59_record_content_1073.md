Obituary.  Samuel Craig died 21 March at Stirling West.  He was a former resident of Hallett & District and of Kooringa.  He was born at Booborowie on 12 May 1866, the son of the late Mr & Mrs James Craig of Booborowie.  As a young man he went farming at Peak Vale, but in the severe drought of 1896 he sold out and went to Broken Hill, where he lived till 1908.  He then returned to Hallett and in 1911 took up land adjoining his fatherâ€™s, when Booborowie Station was cut up.  He came to Burra to live in 1938 due to ill health.  He was a staunch member of the Methodist Church and a strong Rechabite.  He married Miss Annie Wilmshurst of Wirrabara in 1893, who survives with one daughter and two sons: Ivy, Mrs A.G. Williamson of Birkenhead, Lance Craig of Fort Garrison, Keswick and Roy Craig of Aldgate.  His sister, Miss Janet Craig of Kooringa is 83.
