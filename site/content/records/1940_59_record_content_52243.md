The Burra Show, 13 October

The show was probably the best ever held in Burra.  The grounds had been re-organised and there was a new sheep pavilion.  The arena has been partially moved to improve the jumps and the cattle pens shifted to the southwest.  All this makes better use of the flatter portion of the grounds.  The good season also helped exhibitors.  Entries were a record 2,569.  Up 800 on last year.  Sideshows were numerous and well patronised.  Never before were there three merry-go-rounds.  Only the timing of the Spalding Rodeo on the same day detracted from attendance.  The gate takings were up £20.  The weather looked threatening at dawn, but turned out to be good.  Cattle numbers were up and of good quality.  Ring event entries were more numerous and more varied, with good competition.  Both pavilions contained splendid displays.  That of the Agricultural Department was particularly effective.  Art entries were down in quantity, but not in quality.  Cut flowers were very good, as were the Dairy Produce and Cookery sections and the Cookery was keenly contested.  Grain and Fodder displays were impressive, while Needlework and Birds were better than ever.

[The next issue of the paper added complimentary remarks about School Exhibits from Burra Primary, Burra High and Booborowie Schools.]

Mr W.H. Lloyd, as President, welcomed visitors and outlined the improvements made.  He thanked the Showmen’s Guild for the fine collection of sideshows.  He introduced the District MHR, Mr A.R. Downer, who opened the Show.  Mr Rex Warnes was then introduced and asked to declare the new Sheep Pavilion open.  He was a member of the Council of the Royal Show and a son of the past President of the Burra Society, Mr I.J. Warnes.  Mr Warnes congratulated the Show on £850 well spent and believed it would house some of the best sheep in the world.  Mr G.S. Stanley MP moved a vote of thanks to the speakers.
