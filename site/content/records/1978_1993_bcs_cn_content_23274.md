BBH Netball

Report of President Jenny Hirschausen.

The 1991 season was successful with the problem of an oversupply of players.  We fielded teams from A1 to J3.  A1, A2, B1 & C1 teams reached the finals and A2 played well in the final, but lost to Blyth by 2 goals.  At the AGM on 24 September office bearers elected were: Patroness, Di Day; President, Jenny Hirschausen; Vice-President, Patrice McInnes; Secretary, Elly Nicholls and Treasurer, Jan Benton.
