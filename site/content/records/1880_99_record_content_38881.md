Report adopted.

Cr W. Hardy thought the financial position was satisfactory.  He regretted being saddled with the Waterworks, but they had to make the best of it.

Cr Rabbich agreed about the finances.  Two years ago things were not so good with a debt of £250 and £300 [due] in bonds, but with economy and receiving licence fees they had managed well – greatly assisted by the Town Clerk.  In 1888 the Waterworks was handed over to the Government – a move he had opposed, as he believed that the Council could always work them more efficiently than the Government.  This had been proved when they returned to Council control.  The planting of No. 2 Reserve was good work he had initiated.

(Cr Sampson: You promised to see it paid for and have not done it.)

Cr Watt felt the Mayor’s report covered the story and he would simply say he had done his best for the town.

Cr O’Leary said West Ward compared favourably with the others and he did not think, as some had said, that the Waterworks were a white elephant.  He thought tree planting should be restrained for a while until the Parklands liability was reduced.
