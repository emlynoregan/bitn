Burra Town Council, 26 November

The Town Clerk reported that since the decision to borrow £400 for the swimming pool under the Government Subsidy Scheme, he had been in touch with the local MP Mr McDonald who thought the terms so good that the Council should borrow more and the application for £500 had been approved.  The Savings Bank had offered a loan of £400 at 4½% over ten years.  State and Federal Governments would be responsible for two thirds of the repayments and Council for the remaining third.  The first year’s repayment would be £29-15-2.  The decision to increase the loan to £500 was carried.

A request to top dress the Kooringa Tennis Club courts with bitumen was received.  It was resolved to give them a quote for the work.

An estimate of £20 was given to the Burra Hospital Board for resurfacing their tennis courts – the Board to prepare the courts.

It was resolved to buy Ron Nickel’s horse for £10 plus £1 for the harness.

[The existing horse was old and unable to carry out the required work alone.]
