Burra Cheer-up Soc.

Last Friday the Ladies’ band went to Adelaide to take part in the Red Cross Appeal.  On arrival they went to Flinders St where the procession was to begin.  It being Show Week the crowds were huge.  The procession began at 11a.m.  Mounted Police led the Crusaders and Returned Soldiers carrying Red Cross Banners, then Lady Galway, the Red Cross Committee and The Ladies’ band.  They were followed by about 3,000 women in white dresses and then the Red Cross Trollies.  The Governor took the salute from a platform at the Town Hall.  The Mitcham Band was opposite to play a march for the procession.  The Ladies’ band played several selections in the afternoon.

On Saturday afternoon the Mitcham Band and the Ladies’ band provided music at the War Tank Demonstration at Unley Oval.  A large crowd had come to see the tank from the French battlefields.  Lady Galway christened it by the name of ‘Grit’ it with a bottle of champagne.  A silk Union Jack was then auctioned and the Burra Cheer-up Society bought it with a £60 bid.  Mr Crewes was presented with the flag by Lady Galway and he had a ride in the tank, which went over trenches and obstacles in a demonstration.  It finally demolished a stone building labelled ‘German Headquarters’.  The Band returned on a special train at 7 p.m.

On Saturday evening Pte Wesley Nankivell returned to Burra unannounced and so missed a welcome at the station, but he was on hand on Friday morning at the Adelaide Station to welcome the Band!
