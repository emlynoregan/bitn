Pt Pirie Correspondent, 3 October

A young man from Burra was married on Thursday at Pt Pirie and being afraid of the amount of rice to be thrown at them the couple drove down the line to catch the train at the other station.

[John Drew (24), son of Thomas Drew, married Catherine Elizabeth Goode (22), daughter of Benjamin Powell Goode at the home of the bride’s father on 29 September 1892.]
