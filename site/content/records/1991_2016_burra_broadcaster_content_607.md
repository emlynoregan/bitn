The Burra Burra DC has established a Youth Advisory Committee, which was given a brief to investigate, recommend and implement actions to satisfy the needs of youth within the Council area.  A Youth Needs Survey has been designed and it will be distributed with the next issue of this paper.  All youth are encouraged to complete the survey and return it to the locations required.

Chris Kelly, Chairperson, Burra & Districts Your Advisory Committee.
