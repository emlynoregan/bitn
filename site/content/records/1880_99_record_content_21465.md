Salvation Army.  A letter to the editor claims that W.H. Hardy’s condemnation of the police inaction is unwarranted as in Clare, where the Salvationists were similarly attacked, there were four plain-clothes police who were unable to call a halt to the trouble.  What could one man do confronted by a crowd of 100 or more?
