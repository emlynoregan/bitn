Burra Antique Fair weekend was a success.  The 20th annual fair drew large crowds to the Burra Town Hall and the Burra School gym where the stalls were set out.  Many also visited Best Place where there was a fruit and vegetable market.  Town shops were well patronised and the Clare Concert Band played in Market Square.  The fair was opened by Peter Cherry of Small & Whitfield Auction Rooms, Adelaide.  Author of Women of Gold, Kevin Kakoschke, signed copies of the book about women of the northern goldfields like Teetulpa, Olary and Waukaringa.  All the sites have already been re-booked for next year.
