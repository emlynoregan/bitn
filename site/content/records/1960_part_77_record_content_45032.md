Accident.  On Thursday afternoon a semi-trailer loaded with 117 bales of wool tipped over at Hanson, blocking half the road, which was busy with Easter traffic.  It was owned by Hi-Speed Transport of Broken Hill who sent two more vehicles and a forklift to reload the wool.  These arrived about 9 p.m.  Complications arose in trying to unload the forklift when the truck got bogged across the railway line when an attempt was made to unload the forklift onto the platform.  That delayed the northbound passenger train for 70 or 80 minutes.  Eventually the forklift had to be unloaded at the Burra Council Depot and driven to Hanson.

Another accident was luckily averted when a connecting bolt on a towbar broke and sent a caravan careering across the road at the scene above.  Fortunately no damage was done and repairs could be effected to allow it to continue.  Police eventually were able to leave the scene after 14 hours at Hanson.
