Golden Wedding of Mr & Mrs D. Radford of Redruth was celebrated on 20 August.  Mr Radford came to SA with his father in 1838 in the Pestonjee Bomajee with Governor Gawler.  He farmed near Angaston and went prospecting in the NT in the early days.  Later he took up land near Kanyaka not far from Quorn for 14 years.  In 1891 he came to Glenora, east of Burra.  He has been twice married.  The surviving children are Messrs S.O. (South Africa), D.H. (Canegrass), M.A. (Redruth), F.W. (Glenora), G. (Sydney), and Mrs John Bowman (Leighton).  There are 12 grandchildren, of whom Mr V. Nicholls is in camp.
