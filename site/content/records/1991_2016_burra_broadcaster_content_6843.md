The Copper Trek to Kadina left on Tuesday last week.  Virtually all the schools along the way are using the trek as a learning tool.  On Tuesday younger classes from Burra & Mt Bryan completed a 5 km or 10 km section, starting from the school oval.  Many locals joined in with horses, buggies and coaches.  The final stage reaches Kadina on Saturday 13 May at the Kernewek Lowender Festival.  [Photo and other photos page 10.]
