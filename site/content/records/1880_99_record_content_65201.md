Mr Jenkins wanted to know if the Council intended to spend £150 on a cycle track in Victoria Park.

Cr West favoured a subsidy.  Cr Pederson would not so spend ratepayers’ money.

Cr Fuss was in favour of making a track in co-operation with the various clubs in the town.

Dr Sangster wanted more scavenging in the main street as there was undesirable rubbish between the P.O. and the hospital.

Then the attention turned to the Waterworks.

Cr Winnall moved there be a poll of the water ratepayers for 1 December 1898 to decide whether the Waterworks should revert to the Government or if the Council should continue to run them.  He condemned the action of the Government.  He was clearly annoyed by their clause about late payment as well as their refusal to yield on capital cost.  A 1% drop in interest would save about £87 per year.  It was impossible to continue with over £300 a year in interest plus expenses due to breakages, repairs etc.  At one time the Government took water from them and this had helped, but lately they had not taken any due to construction of dams etc. along the line.  In future they could not count on the Government taking any of the water.  Without this they could not have kept up the payments.  He thought the mains would last a good while yet, but service pipes would require attention in the near future.  Why, he asked, was Burra charged 5% when similar works were charged only 2½%?  Some wanted the Council to go on with the works, but he was in favour of handing them back to the Government in the expectation that after a few years they would be glad to hand them over at a reduced rate.  He felt we were making up for losses on the Beetaloo Works.  The tank on the hill was not enough neither was the reservoir.  [Wasn’t the tank on the hill the reservoir?]  A reservoir of only 31,000 gallons was ridiculous for a town of Burra’s size.  All Councillors except the Mayor were in favour of handing the Works to the Government.

Cr McLaren thought Burra people were not pushy enough – other towns get help for frivolous things while Burra is snubbed and refused help.  He felt a decisive vote on 1 December would have the Government backing down.

Mr Jenkins said no one had shown yet that any serious expenditure would be incurred if the Council continued the Waterworks.  He said rumour had it that pipes were rotten and the boiler would burst and the works generally were in a bad state, but none of this opinion was supported by any evidence.  He clearly felt that there was a huge cost borne by ratepayers in watering the town’s trees. If the Government took over he expected that those now paying 15/- would pay 25/-.

Mr Snell said half the residents did not pay water rates.  There will certainly need to be a new reservoir and a new pumping plant and whoever runs it the burden will fall on the ratepayers.  He was sure the Council could work it much cheaper than the Government.  He thought the mains should be extended to bring in greater revenue.

Mr Davis said about 50,000 gallons were used daily and the Council was paid for about a quarter of it.

The Mayor disputed that figure.

Cr West said the Commissioner had admitted the Works could not be of the same value now as they were when they were built 14 years ago.

Cr Pederson supported the motion for a poll and believed much water went unpaid for.

The Mayor opposed the motion, believing the Council should carry on as being much the more efficient at running the scheme.  No disastrous events were likely in the near future and not more than 10,000 to 15,000 gallons were used [daily].

Mr Davis said he didn’t like to be called a liar – or as good as – and if the 30,000 gallon tank was full at night and empty in the morning it had to go somewhere and there was all the day pumping too!

Motion carried.
