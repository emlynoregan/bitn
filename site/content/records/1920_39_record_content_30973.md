Frank Treloar: Looking Back (Continued)

The Victorian gold rush placed a great deal more money in circulation in SA.  Early in 1852 the men left and it was well into 1853 before enough returned to restart the mine.  In the meantime further cottages had been built in Paxton Square to house miners brought out from England.  They were solidly built and many years later when SAMA was selling their properties the late John Lewis purchased the square of 33 cottages and at his death they were left in trust to house the poor and needy of Burra.  To start the mine the horses were brought back from Clare where they were being cared for by Mr E.B. Gleeson.  Development work at the Smelting Works was resumed.  Horse feed was dear and remained so – even in 1855 up to £20 a ton was paid for it.

The first mules for the Smelting Co. arrived in July 1853, but only 70 of 180 purchased survived the voyage.  Firewood rose from 7/- to 12/6 a ton and other timber was also dearer.  Captain Roach told the directors that a pump was needed at the mine and that when operating the water could be made to drive much of the machinery.  Carting of ore to Pt Wakefield gradually fell off as the Smelting Works overcame problems and by 1854 they could handle all the ore delivered.  The arrangements with the Smelting Co. changed and they now delivered the assayer value of ore in ingots or tile of pure copper to the Mining Co. which disposed of it as it saw fit.

The Patent Copper Co. (Smelts) now became a large buyer of firewood and also of feed for horses.  They established a farm at Mintaro to grow hay because it was thought then it would not grow near Burra.  This Patent Copper Co. Farm is now known as Kadlunga, home of Mr & Mrs Alick Melrose.  Mr & Mrs Sam Baker of Redruth are a link with this time.  Mrs Baker came with her parents when her father was engaged to work in the smelters in 1848 when she was 3 years old.  They moved into Sunday Row after a makeshift home at first.  She remembers the Smelts under the management of Mr Williams.  Mr Baker was born in Adelaide close to [Holy] Trinity Church in 1840 and came to Burra in 1852.  He has worked in both the Mine and the Smelts and carted on the roads too.  He went to the Snowy River diggings in 1859, but was not fortunate.
