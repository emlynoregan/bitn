Kooringa News, 25 June

Accident at the Burra Mine.  A lad named Kean fell down a shaft 120 ft deep on Saturday.  When carried from the scene he was found to have a compound fracture of the leg, a fracture of one arm, dangerous concussion and extensive bruising.  He has been in a critical condition for two days and the doctor had but faint hopes of his recovery.  Today he is reported a little better.  It is surprising that there are not more accidents at the Mine and I suppose there are few mines with comparable numbers of men and boys working that escape with such a comparatively small number of casualties.  [SA Deaths CD does not record a corresponding death.]

Readers may wonder at my comparatively cool reaction to the news from the Bon Accord Mine compared with the ‘marvellous discoveries’ reported by your contemporary.  I would be happy to report better things, but upon enquiry have heard nothing that would justify reporting anything very encouraging.

Last week a woman residing at the smelting works tried to commit suicide by means of laudanum, but she was frustrated and has since recovered.

Sheep farmers on the North Eastern Plains are complaining of want of rain and some stations report they are destroying large numbers of lambs in anticipation of the want of feed in the coming summer.
