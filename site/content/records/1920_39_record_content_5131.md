Burra Football Association.  The arbitrator, Mr Winnall, was called on to decide whether Cossey had been playing without obtaining a proper permit â€“ i.e. had no valid clearance from his previous association.  The result of finding the allegation proved would be to automatically cause Kooringa to forfeit games played since they played Cossey.  The arbitrator said he had a valid permit, but no clearance, but it seemed very late to be bringing the matter up and he refused to make a ruling that would strip Kooringa of its wins for the year.  In a fairly technical decision Mr Winnall ruled that Cossey could continue to play.
