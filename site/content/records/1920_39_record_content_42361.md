The seasons being good the first draft of cattle to be sent to market was despatched in 1881.  They walked to Farina, then by rail to Terowie and then walked to Adelaide.  They averaged £8-2-6 a head.  Seasons remained good till 1889, but prices of cattle fell and there was little profit.  Mr Treloar visited the station again in 1881. In 1886 Arthur married and took his wife north to the station.  After some two years they decided to move south.  Mrs Arthur and girlie were taken to Farina and Arthur returned to join Walter on the station, now in drought.

They searched for water to the west and southwest and eventually found some on Coongara Creek at Allemmba Waterhole.  On the way back Arthur fell very ill and only slowly recovered.

The drought almost immediately broke.  Arthur wanted to move south, but the owners said if he did they wanted to sell out.  In the end Duncan & Treloar sold out to Arthur & Walter Treloar on terms favourable to each.  James Cowan bought Crown Point Station on the Finke River and was negotiating to buy Treloar’s Station when he was killed in a railway accident at Dry Creek.  They then sold to Melbourne people who made such a mess of it (or their manager did) that the Treloars had to resume the station because payments misfired.  Walter took over in a severe drought.  The cattle died and then the horses, and though the rains came the Treloar’s were ruined.  The Government gave no encouragement and they had to abandon the lease.  Two years later it was let, so Frank Treloar believes, for 42 years at 1/- per mile, though previously it had cost 2/6 a mile.
