‘Traveller’ writes 24 October:

Drivers of light vehicles on roads near Adelaide are continually in danger from those in charge of horse and bullock teams.  The drivers are often asleep in their drays or walking leisurely along a considerable distance behind them.

Editor: Why do you not lay an information with the police?
