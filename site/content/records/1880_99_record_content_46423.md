2nd Leader on the Broken Hill Mines

Tomorrow an attempt will be made to restart the mines, but directors will not honour the 1890 agreement.  New regulations, which directors hope will be accepted by the men, have been rejected by labour leaders.  The dispute has been going on for about six weeks.

The writer took the view that the directors were mainly to blame and it was their intransigence and determination to break the power of unions that was at the heart of the matter.
