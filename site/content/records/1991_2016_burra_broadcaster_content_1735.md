Andrew Butler of the Burra Tourist Association led a six hour tour of the near rural area to the east to show to people the tourist potential with the possible spin-off that visitors would spend an extra night in the town.  Merino breeding is the chief industry of the area and Andrew pointed out that in 1934 sheep sales in Burra were recorded with numbers of up to 44,000 in a single sale and a figure of 34,000 was recorded not so long ago.

What makes Mt Bryan sheep so great?  The altitude, or the copper, or a mixture of environments in a small area?  There was a shearing display at Don Griffen’s, the area’s most recently registered sheep stud.  A special feature of the property is the air conditioned dust-free rooms used for artificial insemination and embryo transfer.  The AI capability is 150 sheep a day.  There was also a customized horn trimming race.  The drop-off in rainfall as you crossed the range was explained and the area’s history was highlighted with reference to Goyder and old silver mines and there were some great views.  Newikie Gorge was well suited for a barbecue lunch and there were many birds to be seen; apparently some 150 species inhabit the area.  The tour went on to Panunda [Poonunda?] and Mongolata and called in on Robert Heading at Wildildie for a cuppa.  There is potential to develop a tour along this sort of route.
