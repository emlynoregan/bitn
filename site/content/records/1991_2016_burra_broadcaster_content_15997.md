The Sporting Car Clubâ€™s Burra to Morgan Run at the weekend was a great success.  Fourteen veteran cars and motor cycles participated.  Deputy Chairman of Goyder Council, Cr Graham Kellock, flagged off the vehicles from Market Square.  There was morning tea 18 km out and lunch at the Burra Creek, where the Girl Guides Support Group cooked a chop picnic for them.  There was a barbecue tea at Morgan and a return run to Burra or Adelaide on Sunday.
