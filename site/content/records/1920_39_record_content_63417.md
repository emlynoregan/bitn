Illuminations and Decorations

No expense was spared to see both ends of the town decorated with lavish displays of bunting, fluttering pennants and lines of tiny coloured electric bulbs.  As well as masses of such lights, the Memorial in Market Square was floodlit and so was St Joseph’s with its wonderful cross.  The decorations extended from the Hospital to the Bon Accord Hotel.  Market Square and the Rotunda were a brilliant focal point and arches greeted visitors arriving from all directions.  Business places, however mundane, were converted to places of beauty and everyone seems to have responded with decorations.  Most businesses also took the opportunity to paint and varnish their premises.  Prizes were offered for the best decorated shops in two categories.  Other places were not deterred by the lack of a possible prize and the four banks joined in.  Rock gardens and window boxes appeared along with masses of flowers, ivy and streamers.  Elder, Smith & Co.’s office was very striking with its pillars of ivy, lovely hanging baskets and window boxes.  All the hotels made a big effort, but the palm must go to the Royal Exchange.  The upper and lower storeys were uniformly festooned with hanging plants and floral baskets.  The awards were restricted to shops, although other premises were given honourable mentions.  Visitors were called upon to act as judges: Miss Rattenburt from England, Will. J. Edwards from Broken Hill and P. Milner of Adelaide.  In the large shop category Bence’s Ltd were first with Miss Decima Warner’s sweets shop second.  Both the small shop prizes went to Aberdeen.  First was Mr Milton Tiddy and second was Miss Bentley’s shop.
