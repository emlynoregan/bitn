Kooringa News, 12 December

Inquest/Obituary.  August Fischer, a miner of intemperate habits met a friend named Killick outside the Miners’ Arms on Saturday evening 8 December.  Killick asked him if he would have a nobbler.  Deceased said no, he would have a bottle.  Killick refused, but said he would give him half a pint if he drank it at one draught – if not the deceased was to pay half.  The half pint was drawn and the deceased drank it at two draughts.  Asked if he would have another, he said yes.  This he drank and then fell down.  It was assumed by all that he was intoxicated.  At closing time (11 p.m.) he was laid on the floor of a bedroom with a pillow under his head.  In the morning he was found there quite dead with his face embedded in the pillow.  Dr Dashwood attended.  An inquest was held before W.H. Challoner.  The conclusion was that he died of apoplexy accelerated by drinking a pint of brandy.  The jury censured the barman William Fowler and James Killick for administering the drink knowing at the time the deceased was under the influence of liquor.

[August Fischer died 9 December 1866, Kooringa aged 52.]
