There was also a farewell for Mr Bentley at the Burra Council Chamber on Thursday evening, when the town’s businessmen met.  Speakers included Mr A.B. Riggs, Mr H. N. Potter (of Drew & Crewes), Cr Jennison, Mr F. Sara, Mr Max Pearce (Elder, Smith’s – as a Member of the Institute Committee), Cr Kellaway, Cr R. Jeffery, Mr E.J. Davey and the Mayor Mr T.H. Woollacott.

The Mayor said James Bentley’s 43 years in service with Drew & Crewes had only been exceeded by Mr G. Herbert’s 53 with Messrs Walker & Sons.  He recalled Mr Bentley’s role as conductor of the Burra Ladies’ Band [during WWI] and as a member of the Choral Society.

A presentation was made of a travelling rug, a Tower chrome teapot and a cut glass cream bowl and jug.  Mr Bentley replied with feeling of the wrench of leaving after virtually a lifetime in the town.  Of the Ladies’ Band he recalled:

‘At the first practice night they had kicked up a terrible row and for several nights after that in the Cheer-up Room.  One day the manager of the Bank of Australasia had come to him and said, referring to the band, “Look here Bentley, are you going to shift that Band or am I going to shift the Bank.”

He had told Mr Harcus that he’d better shift the Bank, because the band was going on.  The girls knew a lot about music and soon learned to blow the instruments.’
