Burra Regional Art Gallery

The exhibition ‘20 20 Vision’ is part of the SALA Festival and displays works of local and regional artists and some from further afield, to mark the gallery’s 20th anniversary.   The four S.T. Gill paintings have received attention of Artlab with assistance from Goyder Council and an upstairs room is being prepared to show a unique Barbara Hanrahan collection donated by Barry and Maureen Wright, containing original works, letters, scrapbooks and memorabilia from the life of this important author and artist with links to Burra.  A new board was elected on 17 August.
