Mr Shipard’s advice was to subdivide the area adjacent to the derelict tennis courts into six new housing blocks for sale to the public.  This would provide housing in Burra where there is a genuine shortage as well as generating employment.  The completed development should then be named the Scroop Estate.

In the light of a response in issue of 8 August this needs more detail
