Obituary.  George Edward Swann died at Redruth 28 July.  He was born at Petoni Beach New Zealand 29 November 1840 and came to Adelaide with his parents as a lad, settling at Walkerville.  He entered business as a young man at Angaston.  At 18 he was a successful candidate for the Wesleyan ministry and attended Prince Alfred’s College and was later stationed at Pt Lincoln and Gumeracha.  He then went to Victoria and served at Yackandandah and Heathcote, after which he left the ministry to return to business for a number of years.  He later returned to the ministry and was stationed at Kingston, Pt Lincoln and Murray Bridge and was for two years pastor at the Minlaton Baptist Church.  Lately he has lived in retirement at Angaston and Semaphore and came to Burra a year ago, where he has worked devotedly in the Redruth Church.  He married Myra Kealley of Angaston nearly 50 years ago. She survives with one son and one daughter: Mr L.K. Swann of WA and Mrs E.W. Dunhill of Redruth.
