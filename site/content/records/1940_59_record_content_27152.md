He saw no objection to councillors carrying their own nomination forms.

Mr S. Sykes

He regretted Mr Bevan’s absence.  Although Mr Bevan had done a lot of work for the town East Ward ratepayers might want a change because Mr Bevan was not a ratepayer in East Ward.  Ratepayers should not treat the Council Election as a joke.  They should elect a person with time to carry out his duties – as was his own case.  With respect to a swimming pool, his experience from elsewhere suggested enthusiasm would soon fade and in a year or two it would be mainly used by visitors.
