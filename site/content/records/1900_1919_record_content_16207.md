The crowd in the streets on Christmas Eve was smaller than in previous years, reflecting the smaller population.  Juveniles made plenty of noise with trumpets etc.  The old habit of decorating shop fronts with green boughs has almost died out and only two or three places continued it this year.  Hotels did a good business, but patrons were well behaved and the police had practically nothing to do.
