Burra RSL

An appeal to fund new RSL Clubrooms was launched in September 1945 and in a few weeks £2,580-6-0 was donated.  The RSL secured an option on the SAFU shop premises with all fixtures and fittings for £2,150.  Before the war the premises had cost £6,000 to £7,000 to build.  On 20 November the RSL authorised its solicitor Mr F.L. Worth to exercise the option.  The transfer proceedings were protracted and have only recently been completed.  An architect had meanwhile been secured to draw up plans to convert the premises to clubrooms – they were to include a dance and concert hall with a concert platform, cloakrooms etc. as well as a billiard room, supper room, lounge and refreshment servery.  A commodious kitchen was to be attached to the rear and the frontage rebuilt.  The architect submitted a price of over £1,000 for these changes, which was beyond the RSL’s financial resources.  Two returned men, Mr Carl Pearce and Mr Morrie Woollacott, then put their heads together and maximised the re-use of existing timber and fittings and were given the work for about £700.
