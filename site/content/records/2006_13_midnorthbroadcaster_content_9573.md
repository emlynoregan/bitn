The Anglican Church of St Edmund at Booborowie was officially closed with a special service on 7 February.  Rev. Michael Hillier of Burra delivered the closure document to the final congregation.  Rt Rev. Garry Weatherill, Bishop of Willochra, presided at the service.  Mary Shattock, who had been the organist for many years, presided at the organ for the last time.  The foundation stone of the church was laid by Mrs A. Affolter in 1923 and the church, built to seat 80, was dedicated 20 July 1924.  Before that services had been held in private homes and Booborowie Hall.  Additions to the chancel and vestry were dedicated in 1928 and the church was finally consecrated on 8 November 1929.  [See Burra Record of 27 November 1929.]  The church has not been used for a number of years, but it was thought appropriate that there be a final service of Evensong.  After that a short ceremony of secularisation concluded with the Bishop extinguishing the altar candles and carrying the altar cross from the building.  The furnishings have been removed and the building has been sold, to become a home.  On 6 February 1960 George and Anne Williams of Booborowie were married there and so celebrated their golden wedding the day before the final service.  They spent the last few weeks preparing the building for the service.  After the service the congregation adjourned to the Booborowie Hall Supper Room for a shared tea.
