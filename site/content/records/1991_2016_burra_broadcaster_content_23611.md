Rod Peppiatt’s talk at the centenary of the Masonic Lodge’s premises is continued.

[The talk continues with an outline of where the Methodist chapels were in Burra.]

The Wesleyans had a chapel in Chapel St on the site of the present Uniting Church.  And another in Redruth behind the present Lutheran Church.  [This is incorrect: that chapel belonged to the Primitive Methodists.]  There was another Wesleyan Chapel on Ludgvan Street.

The Bible Christians had a chapel in Paxton Square, but it quickly became too small and they built another in Bridge Street East.  They also had one in Hampton.

The Primitive Methodists had a chapel at the Thames Street site in 1849, which was reopened and enlarged in the 1850s and then restored or rebuilt in 1879.

There were also Methodist chapels at Copperhouse, Iron Mine, World’s End, Hanson, and Baldina and into the surrounding countryside.

In addition Burra had buildings erected by the Anglicans, Roman Catholics, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Salvation Army, Baptists and independent churches.  The activity was frenzied in the very early days and restarted with vigour when the men returned from the Victorian goldfields in the mid 1850s.

The Primitive Methodists seem to have been led by lay people until the appointment of William Whitfield in 1851.  Unfortunately most of his congregation soon went to the Victorian goldfields.  Rev. John Gibbon Wright arrived in 1856 to reopen the derelict chapel.  He is recognised as one of the ‘characters’ of Burra’s early days.  His booming voice is said to have been audible nearly half a mile away when the church windows were open.  He managed to reopen the building on 24 August 1856 at a cost of £502, with a debt of £139.  Funds were raised at tea meetings and several were held in that year.  By 1860 he had moved on, but returned for a gathering in 1861 when 3,000 gathered in an open-air service.

When Methodist union occurred in 1900 several Methodist churches became surplus to the needs of the new church.  Negotiations with Kooringa Lodge No. 6 commenced and the outcome was the sale of the building to them for about £350.  The lodge held its first meeting in the building on 16 October 1900.
