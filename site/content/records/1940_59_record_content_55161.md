Burra Pre-School Kindergarten.  The Supervisor, E.M. Richardson, writes concerning the precarious state of the operation.  After 4½ months the numbers are much too low to continue.  There are 20 enrolled, but the peak attendance is only 14.  The Kindergarten is held in St Mary’s Parish Hall each morning and appeals for equipment have been well responded to.  It is well equipped and L. Fiebig’s taxi service transports the children to and from the hall.  Every call for equipment and aid has met a ready response and finance is not lacking.  Everything is in place except for the number of children to make it viable.  This is a surprise to the writer as experience of similar schools in other country towns has seen enrolments of 30 with a long waiting list.
