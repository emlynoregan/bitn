Burra Racing Club

After negotiations with Mr L.H. Thomas, the club has acquired a piece of land to enable the running track to be lengthened and so eliminate the steep grade that horses had to negotiate on the northern end of the track.  Fencing of the new track is in progress.  Arrangements are well in hand for the winter meeting, to be conducted at the Balaklava Racecourse 31 March 1954.
