Burra Burra Hospital held its AGM in Burra Council Chamber 26 August.

E.L. McWaters, as Chairman, presided.

Throughout the year getting trained staff has been a major problem.  Only one trained person was available until recently when three double certificated Sisters joined the staff. Thanks go to G.S. Hawker who obtained the services of Sister E.J. Collins following the resignation of Sister Young and to Dr & Mrs Pitcher who obtained staff members Sister Krushell, Guymer, Wilkins and Smith.

Mesdames Collins and Gebhardt also assisted in this regard and also Sister Tucker’s call depot.  Others who assisted in staff shortages were Mesdames Odgers, Lynch, O’Sullivan, Young, Jeffery, Edwards and Cox.  Thanks also to members of Women’s organisations for assistance with cooking and the care of linen.

At present the hospital has three double certificated Sisters, five Probationers and eight domestics including the porter.  During the year the Nurses Home was completed and declared open by Mr G.S. Hawker.  The building cost £26,600, including furnishings and was financed by a Building Fund Committee and Government Subsidy.

A bathroom in the Maternity Wing was converted to a shower alcove and the other bathroom altered at a cost of £371 (also subsidised by the Government).  A woodshed was erected and the old bathrooms that served the women’s ward became a more centrally located store room.  No. 5 private room was converted to a duty room for staff.  The isolation block has been redecorated and will become No. 2 Nurses’ Quarters.  The roof of the general portion was painted.  When further interior painting has been carried out major maintenance items will have been taken care of.

The fete this year raised £675-2-0, which went towards the £828 needed for painting the roof, redecorating No. 2 Nurses Quarters and the dining room and to new floor coverings for the same.

During the year 366 patients were admitted and the average occupancy was 11.16 beds at an average cost of £3-10-7 per bed [per day].  [A breakdown of costs is included.]

The overdraft remains very high at £3,568 on 30 June.  Some progress has been made and the working account shows a credit for the year of £841.  The hospital has been greatly helped by having the supervision of administration done by the Town Clerk, Mr E.R. Davey.  Unfortunately he has indicated that this will not be possible in the coming year and this will have to be addressed.

[A statement of revenue and expenditure is printed.]
