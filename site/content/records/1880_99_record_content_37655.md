Redruth Court.

Young sued Henderson for £2-12-6 for a quarter’s instruction + £2-10-0 in lieu of a quarter’s notice to withdraw the child from the school.  There was no evidence presented re the contract entered into, or even an advertisement of the school to assist.  The court ordered a payment of 18/6 for one month’s tuition and the cost of some books.
