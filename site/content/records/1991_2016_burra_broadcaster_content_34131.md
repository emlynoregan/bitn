Letter.  Patricia Dale of Georgetown writes wondering why the area from the Morgan Road –Young St intersection to the Burra Golf Club could not be zones for industry, as it already seems to have that characteristic – or alternatively along the bypass.  Either of these areas is away from aged care homes, the hospital or private housing and there is better road access.
