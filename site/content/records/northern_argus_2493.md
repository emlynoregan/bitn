Burra Burra DC: Meet the Candidates

Chris Reed is married with two children and involved in the family farming business.  The reed family has been in Burra for five generations.  He has been much involved in community activities, having been Chairman of the Coppertown Festival, and secretary of the Burra-Broken Hill Barrow Push.  With the downturn in the rural economy the town has to develop tourism to maintain services and employment.  Rationalisation of Council plant and staff and services has been the right step.  The Council needs to be efficient if it is to keep its identity in the face of threatened Council amalgamations.

Gary Donaldson is a professional wood-turner and has lived in Burra for two years as co-proprietor of the award-winning Cousin Jack’s.  He was formerly a supervisor trainer with the E & WS Department and has extensive experience in management, customer contact and presentation techniques training.  He advocates open government and is a strong supporter of Burra’s destiny as a quality tourism product.

Barry Wright has been a Burra North resident for four years.  He and his wife own a wool and skin business and have renovated the old Sara’s Store, which now operates as Sara’s Secondhand Goods and Clothes.  Before coming to Burra they successfully published and distributed a set of navigation charts of the River Murray upstream of Renmark.  Barry is an active member of the Burra National Trust and has been involved in community projects like the Copper Festival.  He sees his role in Council as promoting better communication with the public and more business enterprise in the district.

Stephen Downs-Woolley is 32 and has lived in the town for seven years.  He is a former police officer and sees the town’s future as a major tourist business centre.  He is a past President of Apex and has served on the Kindergarten and other committees, including the Barrow Push, Jubilee 150, Trade Train and Copper Festival.

Derek Rayfield is the son of a London cabbie and was in the RAF and private business before migrating in 1969 and becoming a member of the RAAF.  He is married with three children and three grandchildren.  He has lived in Burra since 1978.  He has been involved with Senior Citizens and the National Trust and id the Secretary of the Caring and Sharing Group and of the Burra Preservation Organisation.  He is also an active member of the elderly visitation program.  He would, in Council, seek to prevent financial negligence, encourage community involvement in major decisions and seek to maintain roads, footpaths and erect toilets in Burra North.

Robyn Page comes originally from Parramatta in NSW and came to SA with her family in 1969.  She gained her B Ed and with her husband came to Burra in 1981.  They have one son.  She has since been involved in many community activities.  She is particularly keen to see the community involved in decision making and seeks a balance between development of tourism and heritage aspects of Burra.

Jenny O’Connor is 46 and a mother of five.  She is Burra’s Tourist Officer and is descended from a family with Burra connections over 6 generations.  She has had a ten year connection with Burra Scouting and five years as leader of the Cubs.  She has an interest in improving facilities for the young of the district.  She also has a long connection with Senior Citizens (Her mother Mrs Ryan was President of the Pensioners’ Group for 17 years before the Senior Citizens was established).  She has been a member of the National Trust for 18 years and a school bus driver for 13.  She is committed to the town’s heritage and sees tourism as Burra’s industry of the future.  She believes in open communication.
