The Goodwood Citadel Brass Band & Glee Party visited last weekend.  They arrived at 7.30 p.m. and after a hurried hot tea played a few numbers in Market Square before a concert in the Barracks.  Captain Thompson welcomed Bandmaster Hoskins and his men.  On Sunday at 9 a.m. they played several selections at Aberdeen and visited the ill Mr James Thomas at his home.  They assisted at all services at the Barracks and gave a concert in the Rotunda in the afternoon and another in Burra Town Hall after the evening service.  On Monday they played selections at the home of Mr J.R. Barker en route to Mongolata for a concert and also paid a visit to the Byles’ Mongolata Mine.
