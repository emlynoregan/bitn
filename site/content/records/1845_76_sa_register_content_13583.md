Kooringa News, 18 July

Last week a committee of the Broughton River Mining Company visited the mine.  They reported very favourably on its prospects and on the recently discovered lode.  Shareholders are encouraged and several experienced miners have urged the full development of its resources.  The lode has widened to 12 or 15 ft and experienced men say that with sufficient capital the enterprise would be well rewarded.

The discovery of the new mine on Yorke’s Peninsula has caused no little sensation here and I have heard of several parties who contemplate travelling there.

Rev. Ibbetson of St Mary’s has preached two sermons in aid of the cemetery funds here.  Other ministers are likely to emulate him.  It is time some such effort was made, as the walls surrounding the burial ground are yet to be paid for and efforts to interest the public have so far failed.

The weather has continued fine with only a little rain and some frosty mornings.  The sunshiny days have seen the continued growth of pasture.
