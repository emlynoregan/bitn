Burra Burra DC & Advisory Council held a meeting and it was decided an approach should be made to the State Unemployment Relief Scheme (SURS) for assistance in the renovation of the Burra Town Hall stage area and dressing rooms.

A sub-committee has drawn up detailed plans for the redevelopment of part of the Burra Creek Reserve and a grant to enable this will be sought as soon as possible.
