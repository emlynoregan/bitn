Jubilee Hall: Memorial Stone Laying, 7 May.

The children collected £10-0-3 towards the target.

It was a bleak afternoon for the ceremony which was conducted by Rev. W.F. James.  When Methodist Union was decided upon some seven years ago, it was also decided that the Primitive Methodist Church should become the Sunday school for the Redruth Methodists.  Six months notice has been given to vacate the German Church in which the Methodist [Wesleyan] Sunday School has operated for about 20 years.  It had been decided to take down the west wall and extend the building by ten feet and to lay six memorial stones.  The mallet employed had been used to lay the foundation stone of the Church of England Hall and the Kooringa Bible Christian Manse.  Stones were laid by:

For Redruth Church by Mr W.A. Rabbich

For Redruth Sunday School by Mr B. Preece

For Other churches in the Circuit by Mr J. Flower

For Kooringa Methodist Church by Mr J. Lane acting for Mr J.M. McBride

For the Salvation Army by Mr F. Harris

For the Town and District by the Mayor, Mr E.W. Crewes

Half the provisions for the tea were donated by W.R. Ridgway and the rest by subscription.

The proceedings throughout the afternoon and evening were affected by the wet weather, but still in all £50-13-3 was raised.  A further £80 is needed as the trustees are determined not to increase the £200 debt on the building.
