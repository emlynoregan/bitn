Bob Heath

Aged 46 and married to Marg with a combined family of five children.  We are committed Burra residents with pride in our town and lifestyle.  I am a self employed commission agent with an office in Commercial Street and conducting a real estate and insurance business.  I have lived in Burra for four years and have supported junior sports, school and church.  I was born into a farming family at Wudinna and spent most of my working life in the rural agency field in the Lower North and Eyre Peninsula and have a deep appreciation of the needs of rural SA from farmers to housekeepers and small shopkeepers.  As a Councillor I would listen to all electors and work for their interests.  The development of industry is paramount in my view also.
