Editorial.  The German Colonist.

This was a very sensible and calming column urging understanding for Australians of German origin and/or German descent, now that war had broken out.

‘Let us . . . treat our German fellow citizens with chivalrous consideration.  Let us not by taunt, word or insinuation wound susceptibilities which at this time are very sensitive.  We shall then deepen and enrich their devotion to our country, and our kindly feeling will react upon our own national character as well.’

The Hon. J. Cook PC, Prime Minister of Australia, was unable to come to Burra on Tuesday evening as planned.  The Hon. D.J. Gordon and Mr B. Benny gave addresses in his place.  [A Federal election was scheduled for 5 September.]
