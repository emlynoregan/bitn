Burra Town Council.

A shed for the water cart is to be erected alongside the old Baptist Church and tools etc. are to be moved to the building.

[Apparently permission to use the building had been obtained.]

Goats straying within the town are to be destroyed.

Graves 2433 to 2540 are to be set aside for pauper funerals and are to be dug 10â€™ deep for three burials.
