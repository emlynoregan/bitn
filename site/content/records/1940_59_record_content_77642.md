Inter-High School Sports were held at Burra recently.  A crowd of about 1,000 attended.  Competing schools were: Burra, Balaklava, Riverton, Kapunda and Clare.  For Burra, Betty Launer was outstanding in winning the open 100 yards and open 75 yards.  Marie Eberhard won the Intermediate 100 yards and 75 yards.  [Other Burra results are printed.]

Clare won the major shield and Balaklava the junior shield.  [Burra was apparently placed last.]
