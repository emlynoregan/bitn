Editorial by Terry Wilson on the Burra Show.

While commending the show, Terry suggests it may need to change as years go by to avoid dwindling crowds and perhaps some inventive minds are needed.  He throws in a few thoughts:

Would a different time of year be better?  For example could it be linked to the Merino Field Days and if so could it use the Field Days marquees at the oval, rather than the existing showgrounds?

Could a Saturday night headline entertainer be a boost?  Wirrulla did it with Kasey Chambers.  Perhaps with a ute muster beforehand.

Is it necessary to change the word ‘show’ and would ‘fair’, ‘field day’ or ‘expo’ have more appeal?

Could the focus be better fixed on livestock and mixed farming?
