Burra Cheer-up Soc. last Wednesday 10 March welcomed home Pte Will Henderson who enlisted in January 1915.  The Ladies Band played Home Sweet Home and the welcoming speech was delivered by J. Drew standing in for E.W. Crewes who was too ill to attend.  He was presented with a gold medal and was then driven home in James Reed’s motor.  On Monday 15 March they assembled again to welcome home Sgt Walter R. Lee and Mrs Lee.   He was one of the first twenty-three to enlist from Burra.  We believe that Sgt Lee is the last Burra Boy to return to Australia, though Cpl Arthur Winders (MM with bars) is in Bedford Park Military Hospital and we hope one day to welcome him to Burra.  He has been back for some time.

[He had been back in Australia since April 1919 and he did return on 27 August, but only to die on 1 September 1920.  See the papers for 1 September and 8 September.]

Sgt Lee enlisted 21 August 1914 and was attached to the 3rd Light Horse.  He was invalided to England in 1916 and has since been attached to the Motor Transport Coy.  He was accompanied by his English wife and child.  (‘Bobbie’)
