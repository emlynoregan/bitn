The weather has been extraordinarily hot.  Thursday was hot, but Friday and Saturday reached 110Â°F in the shade and it continued hot on Sunday.  Sparrows fell dead from the trees and fowls, geese and turkeys also died.  On Sunday evening there was a thunderstorm with a few drops of rain.  Churches had been practically deserted.  Monday brought a delightfully cool day with 57 points of rain in the evening.
