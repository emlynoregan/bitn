Editorial on The Burra Town Council nearing the end of its year.

The Mayor’s job this year has been difficult due to the state of the Council’s finances.  Before being elected Mayor he favoured a new assessment for the town, believing that many Burra properties were undervalued or had not been assessed at all and rates collected would be insufficient to meet commitments.  This was not done and now valuers’ fees have risen considerably.

The impression had been gained that the Mayor would start with a nice credit balance*, but in fact there was a debit of £348-16-10 at the start of the financial year.  The cost of wages and materials were rising.  He advised the Council to increase the rates.  They did so, but only for the Town Hall account and only a trifle.  As a consequence the debt has grown.  This has resulted from:

Seasonal conditions creating more growth that had to be controlled.

Two wage increases through the Industrial Court.

Higher contributions from the Council for the Fire Brigades Board and Government Grant Account.

As a result rates will have to rise.  Also the Council truck needs replacing and other machinery is needed.

During the year the Town Hall mortgage was transferred from the State Bank to the Bank of Australasia, which entitled the Council to draw up to £3,300 as an overdraft and the Town Hall account is now offset by any credit balance in any of the current accounts, which is often the case.  The Mayor and Mayoress have also had a heavy round of social activities associated with the office and relating to the welfare of the town and district.  We hope he will consent to nominate for the role again.

[*The supposed credit may have been a reference to the £400 loan for the swimming pool, but this cannot be accessed by the Council for other purposes.]
