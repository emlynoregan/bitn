Burra’s Annual Rock ’n’ Roll Weekend has been scrapped for 2009 because of poor ticket sales.  Traditionally it has been held in February, but this year was moved to August due to several larger events being scheduled.  The change of dates and probably the economic circumstances seem to have combined to make the event uneconomic.  The Burra Hotel will still put on its popular Friday night rock ’n’ roll dance, featuring Paul O’Bryan’s Band.
