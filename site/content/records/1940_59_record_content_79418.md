Burra Bowling Club.  The new season was opened by Dr D.M .Steele and the new room by the Mayor Mr E.T. Baulderstone.  The beautification program for the greens was only half finished and most of that was on the ladiesâ€™ portion, but the rest should be completed by next season.  The new sunshades donated by the Associates added to the setting.  Dr Steele in opening the season recalled delightful memories of his 34 years spent in the town.
