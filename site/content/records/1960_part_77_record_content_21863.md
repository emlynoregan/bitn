Burra Catholic Ball.  Although this was an enjoyable function, the response was rather disappointing and door takings amounted to only £45.  Mayor E.T. Baulderstone opened the Ball.  During the evening the Sportsman of the Year was announced by Mr Norman H. Tosh JP.  The three contenders were Kevin Lane of Aberdeen Football Club, Heather Angel of Burra Basketball Club and Barry Taylor of Burra footballers Cricket Club.  The award went to Heather Angel.  Profit for the evening should be £40-£50.
