Koonoona.  On Friday Mr & Mrs W.G. Hawkes entertained tenants and employees and their families and c. 70 assembled at the homestead to enjoy tennis on the court below the terraced lawn, races for the children, a treacle bun contest, putting the eye in the pig, the distribution of gifts and a bountiful afternoon tea.  There is a description of the homestead area with its mass of briar roses which border the creek for some distance almost to Springbank Estate, making the air redolent with perfume.
