Election Meeting at the Institute on Tuesday drew an unusually large number of ladies to hear from the candidates for the two House of Assembly seats for the district.

Healy (Labor):

Was told he had a poor chance in such an agricultural area but he had been brought up on a farm and had followed agricultural pursuits for some years.  He wanted to see the State Bank become a bank of deposit and issue.  He favoured household suffrage.  The present upper house was a menace to progressive legislation, declining last session to pass eight important measures.  He favoured compulsory land purchase for closer settlement.  He opposed further alienation of Crown Lands.  He was for the railway to Queensland, an Outer Harbour and White Australia.  He also favoured mineral exploration and development and a free breakfast table.  He wanted an adjustment to Police Superannuation, old age pensions, early closing and the abolition of plural voting in municipal elections.
