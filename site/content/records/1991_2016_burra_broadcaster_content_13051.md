Council voted to allow the sign 6 votes to 2.

Mr Kazimour then writes at length on the negative decision of the Development Assessment Commission and the biased way it rushed into its decision, railing against the role of the Heritage Adviser and the consequent negative impact on the town’s economic progress as the result of such heritage nonsense that is supported by ‘Douglas Alexander and his Heritage Stooges’.
