The Mayor thought the system worked well.

Cr Woollacott seconded the motion and thought the consequence of the present system was that Councillors not on the Public Works Committee lost all interest and came to Council practically only to pass accounts.

Cr Morgan seemed happy with the present system.

Cr Pearce had received no complaints from ratepayers.

Cr Lee thought it better to make no change at present, though he thought probably matters should be raised at Council and referred to the Committee rather than the other way around.  The motion failed.
