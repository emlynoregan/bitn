Burglaries.  In the early hours of Tuesday morning burglars broke into the Bon Accord Hotel and removed the safe bodily.  They also entered Drew & Crewes’ Bulk Store and stole three tins of petrol.  The safe held about £40 in silver and copper and a 10/- note.  Also taken were a box of cigarettes, a box of cigars, a flask of whisky and a bottle of whisky.  Two petrol tins were recovered from the Mt Bryan Road by Mr Bishop.  The safe has been found near Kapunda.  Oddly enough last Sunday at church Mr Crewes’ and Mr John Drew’s hats were stolen from the vestibule.
