Anzac Commemoration Service.  There was a procession from RSL rooms with the Burra Brass Band in the lead.  It marched first to the Burra hospital and thence to Market Square.  The returned men were led by Major R.C. Sexton and were followed by members of the 23rd Barossa Light Horse, Scouts and Wolf Cubs.  Rev. G.C. Hutchinson took the service aided by Capt. Faulds of the Salvation Army and P.L. Rosman representing the Anglican Church.  Last Post & Reveille were sounded by 8 bugles from the band.  In the evening there was a service at Redruth Methodist Church again conducted by Rev. Hutchinson.
