The Royal Blind Concert Party gave a performance at the Institute on 16 March, but drew only a small audience.  About £7 was taken at the door and as adults paid 2/- and there were some children present the number was small.  Total proceeds including a chair competition at both Aberdeen and Kooringa were £10-1-0.  Phil Killicoat won at Kooringa and Mr Robert Fuss at Aberdeen.
