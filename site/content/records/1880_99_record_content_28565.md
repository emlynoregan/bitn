Burra Mine.  On 4 May the Advertiser reported talk of the Burra Mine being reopened by an English company and how the locals were looking forward to it.  There is the prospect that deep sinking will reveal a gigantic lode.  Burra people have interested themselves in several silver mines in the district: the one at Black Hills being the best known.  It has not been successful yet and the geologists report was not favourable.  To the north the Razorback and Mt Bryan Station are being searched.  Two other syndicates are interested in an area near the junction of the Mt Bryan Ranges and the Ulooloo Hills and a little to the north are good indications of copper.  At Ulooloo scores of reef claims are pegged, but no one as yet has developed any properly.
