Burra Swimming Pool Committee.  After the last football match and paying expenses and sharing the gate with the football club the committee will benefit by about £57.

And what a realistic mock fight that was between Keith Treleaven and Ivan Hirschausen.  Most spectators thought they were ‘dinkum’ and even the police left their cars to intervene.

‘Be honest, what did you think?’
