Burra Mine - Samin Ltd now has the four sections of the new roaster in position, though further equipment is yet to be mounted.  There are twelve square holes running vertically up the tower, which are entries to each of the roaster hearths.  The hearths will be constructed in special refractory bricks and castable materials and work on this began yesterday.  It is expected to take about three months.  On the top there will be a safety stack and four ‘cyclones’.  The latter will separate grit from the exhaust gases.  These will then pass through a large filter to remove any remaining dust, which will then be recycled into the furnace.

[Photographs of the operation are included.]
