Solomon Williams.  Reminiscences of Burra in the 1850s & Early 1860s (Concluded)

At the start of these reminiscences I asked where the Post Office & Court were in the 1850s.  No one seems to know so I will now reveal the answer.  There was, and perhaps still is, a small footbridge across the creek in Queen Street not far from Commercial St.  About 60 yards south of this was Bruce’s [Bruse’s] carpenter’s shop and between there and the bridge were two small attached cottages.  These were used as the Court House and Post Office and seemed quite unsuitable to house such institutions.

The vehicle that brought the mail was a large spring cart drawn by three horses, one in the shafts and two in the lead.  It was timed to arrive at about 7 p.m., but sometimes due to bad roads and adverse weather it was an hour or two late.  On such occasions the waiting boys had a good time at games etc. and I have often been among them.  The veteran driver was Fred Gurney who lived near Commercial St where the creek crosses it.  When driving past his home he would call out ‘Mail O, Mail O, Mail O and the boys said this was to warn Mrs Gurney to get his supper ready.

I was once a witness at the court.  When I was about eight I was one day sitting astride the top rail of a cow yard when a woman with a cut and bruised face came from a nearby house to the Clerk of the Court to lay an information against her husband for assault.  A few days later a policeman came and took me to the court to give evidence of what I had seen.  Mr T.W. Powell was the Clerk of the Court and the postmaster.

I was interested as a boy to see them build the stone arched bridge across Commercial Street.  This was the first time I had seen arch-building and upon its completion it was duly christened and declared open for traffic.  A small daughter of Mr Samuel Drew had been selected to perform the ceremony.  Preparation was made by fixing a post to the stone side of the bridge from which was suspended a bottle of wine.  There were a number of people present when Mr Drew instructed the little girl what to say and then the bottle was shattered against the bridge.  There were no speeches, but a few cheers and some coppers were scattered by Mr George Bennett to be scrambled for by the boys.  Bennett was the ginger beer brewer whose place was next to the Miners’ Arms Hotel.  All the water used for brewing ale by the Burra Brewery came from the well at the back of Bennett’s ginger beer works.  The brewery was situated just past the Burra Hotel now the Hospital.  A water cart drawn by a white horse called ‘Colonel’ was constantly plying between the well and the brewery for years.  I think the water supply for Kooringa was quite inadequate because the rainfall was not generous and one seldom saw a corrugated iron tank, though they were being made in the 1860s.  [Tanks were uncommon before iron replaced shingles for roofing in the 1870s & later.]  Water was stored in zinc lined packing cases procured from the drapers.  These were unreliable as they had a habit of springing a leak just when most wanted.  In summer when rains came to fill them up the extra pressure burst the thin and rotten zinc.  There were a few wells from which water could be carried with two buckets and a hoop.  Water carts also operated, but there is a great difference between now and then in water supply.  The scarcity of water was felt severely in case of accidental fire.  One outbreak I witnessed showed how helpless people were.  A stone and weatherboard house near the Wesleyan Schoolroom opposite Mr Geake’s shop in Queen St was owned by a German family named Langenbergen.  Nothing could be done till the fire engine came down from the Mine and even then it was not very effective because it had to depend on three water carts bringing water from Sampson’s Well across the bridge near the Bible Christian Church.  Despite many helpers the house burnt down before they could properly get going.

In the late 1850s there were four principal butchers in Kooringa: Messrs Watts, Uhlmann, Edwards & Gebhardt.  They were all decent and honourable men, but there was a feeling in the town that the price of meat was too high and an agitation among the miners resulted in the formation of ‘The Anti-Butchers Association’.  The premises secured were situated in Queen St on the corner opposite Mr J. Winnall’s residence (later McBride’s).  This house was transformed into a butcher’s shop.  The miners held working bees to erect yards for sheep, pigs, hay and slaughtering facilities, stables, cart sheds etc.  The first manager was Mr Eddy and the secretary Mr Furness, a brother of Mr Furness the accountant at the Mine.  [Furniss]  A good start was made in supplying cheaper meat, but this did not last for long and I believe the credit system wrecked the enterprise.  The manager could not easily deny credit to shareholders for fear of their returning to the other butchers and so many bad debts resulted; besides we know that a company is not usually managed as economically as a private business.  After a few years the company had to go into liquidation and many lost money over the project.
