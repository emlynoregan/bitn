Burra Town Council, 6 August

The Cricket Club asked to be allowed to level the oval with a buckscraper.  Granted.

Requests to lop trees and have a practice net area at the rear of the bowling green were held over for inspection.

Council resolved to pay the balance of the cost of a 52/- marble cross towards which 35/- had been donated and which the Rev. Hewitson had erected on the grave of the immigrant lad Albert Conquest.  A photo will be sent to the family in England.
