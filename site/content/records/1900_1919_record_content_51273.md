Burra & District Poultry & Kennel Club.

The local Show Soc. did not do much to encourage locals.  Outsiders generally took most of their prizes and the formation of a local club was indicated.  Elected: President, Clem Sampson; Vice-President, C. Fuss; & Secretary, John Allen.  Some changes to the prize list at the Burra show will be sought.
