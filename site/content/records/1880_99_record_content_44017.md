'Resident' writes a letter headed 'BLOWHARD(Y)ISM'

Which makes it clear it was Cr Hardy that tried to get Mr Littlejohn out of the position of Waterworks’ Engineer and now the town has to pay for the blunder.  'This is a start that many expected, and anticipations have been more than realized.'

W.H. Hardy also writes re the Littlejohn episode 'to draw attention to the true state of events'.  The new Council at their first meeting decided to call tenders for an engineer, which resolution was carried unanimously, after each Councillor, as well as the Mayor, had expressed themselves dissatisfied with the engineer. [Littlejohn]

Tenders were invited and 14 were received.

Then 'no less than three councillors voted to reappoint the old man [Littlejohn] and the Mayor gave his casting vote in favour, saying, "oh, let us give him another trial"'.

'I gave my vote against Littlejohn on account of the express dissatisfaction at him by the previous Council bourne [sic] out by the Conservator of Water’s complaints as to the state of the works, when he paid a visit some time since, and on account of general neglect and what I feel it my duty to state as his unfitness for the office.'

The editor comments 'We are aware that it is a serious question and our correspondent has found it out now it is too late.  The £31-4-0 must be paid all the same.
