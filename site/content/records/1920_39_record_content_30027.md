Burra Burra Show Inc.  AGM 1 March

The overall profit for the year was £124 despite losses on the Dog Trials and the special train for the show.

Mr Riggs said the balance sheet made no allowance for depreciation of property.

The President’s report noted the death of Boz Pearce, one of the auditors, during the year and sympathy was extended to the family.

The committee was re-elected unopposed.

The Sheep Dog Trials on 20 & 21 April at the racecourse sustained a loss of £26 which was about average for some years.  The horse races had not helped this loss.

The Northern Country Show Assoc. now had Clare as a member and works well to unify rules etc. and to arrange dates.

The annual show on 5 & 6 October was held in good weather and entries were good all round except for cattle.  Sheep and wool in particular were good and benefited from the decision to classify by district.  The sheep-shed question was deferred till better times.

The caretaker is doing a good job.

In the last year improvements cost £44-14-9.

The train from Adelaide was a rail-car and this cut the loss from £57 last year to £17 this year.

The show made a profit of £151-16-7 and the Dog Trials a loss of £26-17-3.

Elected were Patron, Charles Bartholomaeus; President, I.J. Warnes; Vice-Presidents, M.A. Radford & S.H. Robinson.  The auditors are A.B. Riggs and W.J. C. Ewins (replacing Boz Pearce).
