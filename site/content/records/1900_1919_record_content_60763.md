Adelaide Criminal Sittings

Annie Jordan was charged with the murder of an infant child at Kooringa on 9 April.  She pleaded not guilty.  The Crown Prosecutor presented no evidence beyond what depositions were taken at the inquest.

The Judge then said he did not believe there to be a prima facie case because:

There was no evidence as to how the deceased got into the pit.

There was no proof that the death was not from natural causes.

The Crown Prosecutor said he was prepared to enter a nolle prosequi.

When Mr Shierlaw proceeded to deal with one aspect of the evidence His Honour ordered the instant release of the prisoner.

He said he hoped the legislature would at once take steps to prevent capital charges against unfortunate girls in the position of the accused.
