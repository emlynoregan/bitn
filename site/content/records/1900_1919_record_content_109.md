Boer War.  E.W. Crewes presided at a meeting at the Burra Institute on 22 December whose object was to raise funds for sufferers in the South African War.  No subscription lists are printed yet, but money is already coming in freely.  Rev. W.G. Clarke spoke feelingly.  The greatest sufferers would be those left behind and deprived of their breadwinners.  Rev. Murphy seconded the motion recognising the bravery of the soldiers and calling for all efforts to augment the fund.  Mr Winnall moved for the formation of a shilling fund in Burra.  2nd Mr Cox.  Drs Sangster & Brummitt also spoke and T. O’Byrnes.  The meeting ended with the singing of God Save the Queen & Rule Britannia.
