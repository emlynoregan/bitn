Death of Racing Mare.  A mare worth £200 was shot in the vicinity of the Duffer Dam some 30 miles east of Burra last week.  To destroy traces of the shot the head was then badly mutilated.  The horse was owned by A.J. McBride.  This was probably a ‘sporting’ pot shot like the destruction of insulators on the telephone line not long ago, which cut communications with Burra from several stations.
