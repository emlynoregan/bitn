Obituary.  John C. Sandland died early on Sunday morning last at Koonawarra three miles north of the Burra railway station.  He had been feeling unwell from time to time lately, but did not think it serious.  Just after recent shearing at Koonawarra he went to Nackara to supervise it there, but felt so ill he had to return to Burra sooner than intended.  He thought he had a severe cold, but it grew worse and medical aid was sought.  The doctor ordered complete rest and he had an internal complaint occasioning excruciating pain.  The local doctors concluded that an operation was required, but doubted his strength to cope.  Dr Poulton of Adelaide was summoned and an operation was performed which revealed there was no hope of recovery.

He was the son of the late John Sandland of Woodlands Lyndoch and was born in Shropshire England in 1845, arriving in SA with his parents when only 2.  He always led a life of uprightness and straighforwardness.  He was connected with the Burra District Council for over 25 years and for 15 was Chairman, doing all he could to promote the interests of the district.  He was a pillar of St Maryâ€™s Church where he had filled almost every office.  He had the oversight of the building of the new rectory at Redruth and was on the building committee of the church when it was built.  For several years he was in charge of Koonoona Station and later took up the property where he died.  He became acquainted with the most prominent sheep owners in SA and as a judge of Merino sheep scarcely had a rival.  [John Chesters Sandland, born Loppington Hall, Shropshire England 1845: died 12 December 1909 near Burra.]
