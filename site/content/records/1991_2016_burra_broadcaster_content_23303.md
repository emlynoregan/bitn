SA Merino Ram Sales suggest a shift back to sheep by producers who had scaled down operations in the past decade.  Demand for quality replacement sired lifted considerably.  Buyers are targeting rams of lower microns and paying more attention to wool test figures, suggesting a primary interest in wool production.  Prices for Merino ewes also rose, being $10 to $15 above last year for young ewes.  Ram prices have been $100 to $200 up on average.  Last week’s annual ram sale at East Bungaree saw a total clearance of 95 rams.  At Collinsville’s successful ram sale prices were also up with a top price of $7,500.
