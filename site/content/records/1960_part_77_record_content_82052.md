Continuing members: Mrs O. Holmes, Mrs J. Tiver, Mr D. Nettleton, Mr G. Searle.

Mr D. Lloyd represents the District Council and Mr R. Mason is the Parliamentary representative.

For the Parents & Friends’ Association elected were: President, Mrs C. Stockman; Vice-President, Mrs M. Lloyd; Secretary, Mrs H. Reed and Treasurer, Mrs G. O’Connor.

The Parents & Friends’ Assoc. in 1976 had nine meetings with an average attendance of 48.  Mr R. Thamm reported that the Centenary Booklet is in the hands of Mr I. Auhl and is progressing well.  The application for a dental clinic was refused as there are insufficient students for a full-time clinic, but discussion with Mr Don Dunstan indicated the possibility of a mobile clinic.  Mr I. Allen has resigned as Chairman of the Primary School Council, a member of the Community School Council and as Chairman of the Community School Management Committee after years of dedicated work.  A minute of appreciation was recorded.

A Council Levy of $500 per family, which in comparison to many schools was very modest, was added to the booklist this year.  It will be used for administration costs, insurance fees, maintenance of Council property and for school amenities.  [This must surely be a misprint?]

Mrs E. Carpenter, Community School Co-ordinator reported on programs and services offered.

In 1975 there were four DFE Classes and in 1976 there were 9.  There were 7 voluntary classes in three centres; Burra, Hallett and Booborowie and 4 voluntary evening classes.

In October Community School Week saw 292 adult enrolments.

There was a Vacation Recreation Centre run each holiday.

Youth Club attendance varied from 40 to 80.

The Burra Community Entertainment Group put on Salad Days.

Support was given to Arts Council Productions and to the Art Gallery Travelling Exhibition.

A Junior National Trust Branch had been established.

Horse riding was organised in vacations.

A Dog Obedience Club was run.

There were ballet classes and a DFE class in Leather Embossing.

A Toy Library had been set up.

The Management Committee has taken on the establishment of the Community School Library as a major operation and has instituted a comprehensive list of all organisations and clubs within the district.

Burra Traders’ Association has decided to be more active in trying to bring trade back to Burra.

E.C. Allen MP, Member for Frome writes:

When Mr Jennison greeted the Premier recently he suggested that the Burra District had little or nothing to show by way of benefits from many years of Liberal Party Government.  I cannot speak for the period of the Playford era, but this assertion is not true for the time of the Hall LCL Government 1968-70.  The efforts of the Minister of Mines Hon. R.C. De Garis MLC in that Government had much to do with the re-opening of the Burra Mine by Samin Ltd.  A program of sealing portions of main roads each year was commenced and the sealing of the Hanson-Clare Road was commenced – it has still not been completed after seven years of a Labor Government.  The Hall Government also investigated a site for a new Burra High School and had plans drawn up.  There was then a desire to move to another site and the Hall Government was defeated at that point, but it had much to do with the progress towards a new school for Burra.  Construction work which was begun on the Morgan-Spalding Road by the Hall Government has been discontinued under Labor.

[Check to see if the ‘he’ in the first sentence applies to Jennison or Dunstan.]
