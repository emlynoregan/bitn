Letter.  Bob Skinner writes to say that if 13 people and 6 Councillors attended a public meeting the Council is justified in presuming there is little public interest in the business to be discussed.  Mr Halls’ quotation ‘No way are we going to run back to the public for direction on every matter of policy’ was taken completely out of context.

Nevertheless, Burra has more interests in common with the growing economic centre of Clare and further investigation of the Clare amalgamation prospects should be pursued.
