Letter from ‘Industry’ objecting to the 8-hour day or any other attempt to control wages.

Letter from James Cullen in response to Thomas Watkins, to debunk the latter’s attempt to put himself in a good light over assaulting Cullen’s child.  He says that as the character of Watkins is well known in Burra, Cullen really finds no need to contradict him, but as people beyond Burra might read the paper and so be led to believe Watkins he feels the need to reply.  Watkins suggests that the Cullens have previously annoyed him, a thing Cullen denies and challenges Watkins to find witnesses to the same.

Watkins actually admits the assault in his own letter - in denying he took stones out of the boy’s hands and then saying he knocked the stones from his hands and pushed him backwards.  Had he lived thirty years where he is without a blemish on his character as he [Watkins] asserts, there would be none of this.  ‘I will leave that to all who know him.’
