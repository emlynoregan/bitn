The Hopkins Fund has reached £167 and the meeting about its management decided to pay the widow 10/- a week while it lasts.  [Which for that sum would be c. 6½ years.]  Mr L. Day will supply £20 worth of groceries.  Money is still being collected and if sufficient is raised a cottage will be purchased.  Yet planned is a Muff football game on 30 June and a Burra Musical & Dramatic Club Concert.
