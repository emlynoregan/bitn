Police Court, Kooringa, 19 July

J.S. Barnett alleged that J.R. Mortlock, landlord of the Burra Burra Hotel, had illegally detained four money order totalling 30/-.  Barnett had sent the orders to the hotel to be cashed, but Mortlock had used part of the sum to pay an outstanding bill of Barnett’s at the hotel and returned only the difference.  His worship recommended the orders be returned as the defendant had no right to pay himself, but could recover the account through the court if it was not paid.

Tristram Bath, superintendent of the Princess Royal Mines alleged that William Barrett had illegally removed wood from the company’s land.  Barrett did not appear and a warrant was issued for his apprehension.

Robert Nettle said he had seen the accused load at least half a load on the company’s land on 8 July.  The load was brought into Burra.  The defendant, having nothing to say in his defence was ordered to pay 10/-, being the value of the wood and also fined 20/- with 27/- costs.
