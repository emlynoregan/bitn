Redruth Court, 20 November.

‘Ellen Saunders poundkeeper, Copperhouse, before being sworn promptly asked who was going to pay the expenses for the day.

Mr Winnall: Oh that will be alright, I will see to that.

Witness: Well, that is alright; I can’t come here for nothing.’

[Ellen Sanders: my great-grandmother.]
