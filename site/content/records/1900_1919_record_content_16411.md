Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co.  Promises that a pumping plant would be erected are now two months old and nothing has happened.  The property is being held on sufferance.  A few tons of ore are expected to be despatched to Wallaroo for treatment soon - the second such in twelve months - to help the expense in getting it.

Nothing more has been done at Bunts’s Shaft.
