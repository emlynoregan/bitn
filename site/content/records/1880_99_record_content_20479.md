Bible Christian Manse.  The new Bible Christian manse was opened on Monday last.  It is on high ground not far from the Church and built in a villa style by Messrs Launder, Pearce & co.  A stable has been built and the land enclosed and will be a comfortable home for ministers for many years to come.  The total cost is £700.  It was opened by the Mayor, Mr John Dunstan jun. and the Mayor-elect, Mr D.S. Packard, added some comments.  A tea in the schoolroom followed and an entertainment in the Institute in the evening.  So far £407 towards the cost has been promised and of that £386 actually received.
