Burra Hospital.  The Premier, Hon. T. Playford, visited Burra on Friday 2 October to lay the foundation stone of the new Nurses’ Home.  F.T. Marston, as Chairman of the Board, welcomed the visitors.  He said the Gebhardt bequest had started the process with c. £5,000 and the government had agreed to provide funds on a £ for £ basis.  A public appeal followed.  The proposal was seen as the first stage in a rebuilding process, but was being done in such a way that it could stand alone as a complete unit, so that it would not be wasted in any event.  He also referred to the new bathrooms and other renovations, which owed much to the Red Cross and Air Force Association.

The Premier in his response said the grant to the Burra Hospital had been raised this year from £3,250 to £3,750.  He then laid the stone.  John Gebhardt, as chairman of the Appeals Committee, called for money to be laid on the stone and Mr & Mrs Andrew Tennant started the list with a donation of £200.  Others then brought the total to £432.  [A list of donors is printed.]

Hon. M. O’Halloran, Leader of the Opposition, congratulated Burra on the fine forward move this building represented.

Weather.  The fine rains at the start of last week have assured many eastern properties of water supplies for the coming year.  Falls ranged from 30 to 100 points, but most were in the 50-100 point range.

The War Graves Appeal stands at £61-10-3.

Guy Fawkes Night.  Preparations are in hand for the annual bonfire in aid of the school, organised by R.C. Lott.

John Arthur Woods (25) was arrested near Mt Bryan and charged with the illegal use of a Ford Prefect sedan and a number of driving offences.  He had taken the car from Angus McLean Ltd of Adelaide and had been using it for about six weeks, during which time he had travelled about 10,000 miles.  He and his wife and four young children had been living in the vehicle for about a month in the outback parts of the state.

The Governor, Sir Robert George, will open the new RSL rooms at Hallett on 23 October.

An influenza epidemic is sweeping through the district and seems to have affected Booborowie especially, with over 100 cases in that area.  Fortunately it is not a particularly dangerous strain.
