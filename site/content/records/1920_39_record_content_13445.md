She was born at Stokes, Somerset shire, England on 13 March 1836 and came to Australia in April 1955 [sic] [presume 1855?].  On her marriage to Thomas Chant they lived in Salisbury and then Auburn, before moving to Redruth.  A member of Redruth Methodist Church for 63 years and one of the first Sunday-school teachers, she attended the recent stone laying for the new Sunday-school.  She has of late lived with Mrs S.J. Tralaggan and was ill only a few days.
