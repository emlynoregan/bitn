Kooringa townspeople are agitating for freehold title to property in the township.  A letter signed by leading townspeople has been sent to the Directors, making a series of points.

The Mine had completely stopped work.

Trade had therefore slumped.

The likely siting of the railway terminus would preclude Kooringa from any resulting benefit.

Many of the company’s leases in the town had expired or were on the verge of expiring.

Most of the shops and houses were now or soon would be the property of the company.

The representatives of firms who signed wished to know under these circumstances if the Directors would sell freehold to them and if so at what price.  The result of letting land on 21-year leases with a host of stringent clauses, including one that no public house could be opened without the Directors’ consent, was to create a town that is a laughing stock to strangers.  No one will spend more on buildings than is absolutely necessary.  Residents will not form a District Council or a Corporation, which would repair roads etc. because they will not tax themselves to increase the value of the company’s property, in which they have but a temporary interest.  It is hoped the Directors will agree to sell freeholds at a reasonable price to those who have been at the expense of erecting buildings upon them.
