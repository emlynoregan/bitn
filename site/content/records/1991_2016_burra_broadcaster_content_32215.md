Premier Mike Rann visited Burra en route to Adelaide from Pt Pirie last Wednesday.  He undertook to get a resolution to the Burra Swimming Pool impasse.  It appears that defining the boundary of the land to transfer to Council had been one sticking point, but when this had been agreed as the land within the pool’s perimeter fence, the Department’s manager then could not accept the terms of use agreed to by the school and council in 1997.  [Details are printed.]

Mr Rann also had a look at the Burra Hospital.  The Government recently announced an extra $20 million over the next four years for country hospitals.

He then visited the Smelts Road facility occupied by SES & MFS and stopped also at the closed Burra Railway Station with Heritage Officer Douglas Alexander and Brenton Greenslade, Vice President of BRTBA.
