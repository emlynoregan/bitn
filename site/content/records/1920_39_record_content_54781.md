Early in 1931 Henry A. Byles (who had been overseer for I.J. Warnes) began to drive a tunnel into the hill and won 12 tons on ore yielding 73oz at the Peterborough Battery.  W.J. Richards interested Mr A.A. Thornton in the work and on 9 July 1931 they formed the Mongolata GM Syndicate with a capital of £500 in 50 shares of £5 each.  Thornton became chairman and Messrs Reid & Goodes were co-directors.  With 8 men the syndicate continued the tunnels and also began sinking.  76 tons yielded 467oz of gold to May 1932.  In March 1932 it was decided to extend operations and form a company.  On 19 April 1932 the first meeting was held and a company was formed with a nominal capital of £100,000 in £1 shares.  38,000 have been issued fully paid and 13,000 paid to 10/-.  The late Mr George Milne was elected chairman and the other directors were: A.A. Thornton, D. Reid, H.A. Goodes & I.J. Warnes.  Mr Thornton is now the chairman and other directors are Messrs Reid, Warnes, Daly & W. McEwen.

Following a visit by Sir Herbert Gepp the Commonwealth provided a battery.

The company continued the tunnel to 609ft and a shaft has been cut to 200ft with an underlay shaft a further 220ft where water has been struck.  A lode discovered at water level has not yet been worked.  On the advice of a geologist from England the company is now driving the tunnel a further 671ft to pick up several lodes at a depth of 389ft.  This is expected to be completed in two months.  They originally pegged 17 acres and now hold 180 acres of goldmining leases.

The company is also working at the opposite end to the Byles’ lease on the Golden Harp leases where there are two shafts and two tunnels.  The company has an air compressor and employs 24 men.

All other work on the field is by small syndicates and individual miners using pick and shovel.

Mongolata Goldfield

Byles’ Co. has just put through the battery 130 tons for 103oz with tailings to come (c. £1,000 worth).

It is said that almost 2,000oz have been produced since the report printed in last week’s Record which was up to 30 June 1934.
