Protector of Aborigines’ Report

[There is a lengthy report by M. Moorhouse, the Protector of Aborigines and a letter from E.B. Scott, Protector of Aborigines to the Colonial Secretary.  Perhaps the most interesting comment with reference to the Burra District in its broadest sense is:

‘The squatters on the Murray can also bear witness to the great and important service the natives have rendered them during the late scarcity of labour; and on several occasions, natives have been left sole charge of the squatters’ property; and it is gratifying to state, that in no instance has the confidence placed in them been taken advantage of.’]
