Burra Town Council, 15 June

The Controller of Lights has advised that black-out regulations have temporarily been waived and 100 watt streetlights could be used if effectively screened from being observed by aeroplanes.

Burra Institute letter advised that the Council’s suggestion re taking over the Institute was contrary to the Institutes Act and it could do nothing more in the matter.

Cr Marston pointed out this letter was the result of a misunderstanding.  He moved the Clerk write a letter pointing out the Council had no intention of contravening the Act and at the same time asking the Committee to receive two members of the Council who would explain the scheme.

The ARP Committee desired financial assistance in making alterations to the Air Observers’ Post.  This post would be located at the rear of Matthews Emporium.  All work would be done by volunteers.  Council voted to allow the Committee any sum to a maximum of £7-10-0.
