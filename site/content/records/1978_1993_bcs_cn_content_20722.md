BCS.  Staff Profile: Sarah Rainbow

Began teaching at BCS in Term 2 on contract to teach Maths and Science at secondary level.  My husband and I moved to SA from Victoria where we were both employed in the Victorian Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs.  My husband is working at Clare in the SA Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs as a research agronomist and we are living in Clare.  After completing my secondary education in Adelaide I did a Bachelor of Applied Science at Roseworthy and a Graduate Diploma in Secondary Education in Adelaide.  My interests include swimming, tennis and walking.  Both Rohan and I are loving living in the Clare Valley and I am sure my time in Burra will be rewarding and enjoyable.
