Obituary and Inquest on the body of Doris May Saxon, aged c. 14 weeks.

The inquest was conducted at the Royal Exchange Hotel, Aberdeen, on Saturday.  P.L. Killicoat was coroner and W. Neville was foreman of the jury.

Dr Sangster Sen. had attended the child, but refused a death certificate, being unsure of the cause of death and also ‘in consequence of certain reports which I heard as to the care of the child’.  The post mortem showed the baby weighed 8¼ lb, had no signs of violence and an unusual absence of fatty tissue with pale muscles.  Believed the cause of death was marasmus accelerated by diarrhoea.  [i.e. wasting away due generally to malnutrition.]

Mary Lepley, wife of J. Lepley of Redruth had fostered the child from Mrs Graves of Adelaide and was paid £18 for keeping it forever.  She had the child 13 weeks.  The child started to fail two weeks ago.  Mary Lepley had got the child to clear herself of debts and had done so before - three weeks before Christmas - but had passed that child on to a better home.  On that occasion she had got £15.  The earlier child had been registered as Louisa Lepley.  Mary Sleeman gave evidence that the child had been well cared for.  The verdict agreed with Dr Sangster’s conclusions.

[Doris Mary Saxon born 20 January 1906 to Myra Saxon at East Adelaide: died 4 May 1906 at Redruth.]
