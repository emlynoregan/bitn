Vandalism.  Irresponsible vandals are shooting at and breaking insulators of the Eastern Telephone Syndicate.  This action is not only inconveniencing business, but has the potential to cause death in cases of accident and illness.  The Government line to ‘The Gums’ has been similarly affected.  Penalties are severe and the Syndicate will prosecute where possible.
