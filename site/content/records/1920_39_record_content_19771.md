Burra Town Council

The MPs for the District advised that the Government had no control over the use of the Ballast Quarry and the Council would have to deal with the owner Mr E. Ford.

The Local Government Department would assist with advice about a stone-crushing plant.

The Railways department would allow the use of the plant at the quarry for a small consideration.

Mr Ford is willing to allow the Council use of the quarry for a royalty of 6d per yard.

Moving the Guns, 8 June

The Mayor read the letter from the RSL.  He said it gave no enlightenment.  He denied that the original request for something in writing had been informal.  It was made during the conference; not after.  He thought Mr Hammond’s comments that the Council had not given the matter another thought was beneath contempt.

Cr Woollacott moved the original idea be carried out.

Cr Kellaway thought they needed a cost estimate first.

Cr Kellock was sick of it and just wanted it settled – they should have just got on with the work.  The guns were clearly Council property and the cost of fixing them should come from the Council, not the RSL.

Cr Harris said three schemes had been put to them:

Put the guns in the Avenue opposite the Institute.

Place them in the rotunda on concrete pedestals.  [In the Rotunda area perhaps?]

The RSL’s suggestion.  [Roughly the original plan.]

His motion to place them in front of the Institute had had the support of four Councillors.  These had now ‘turned turtle’. 

The Mayor said when Cr Harris broached his scheme the matter had not been fully thought out.

Cr Woollacott was offended by the ‘turned turtle’ comment – he had changed as a result of the RSL conference.

Cr Kellaway had also changed and now supported Cr Woollacott’s motion and added that its advantage was that it cut off the dangerous road between the Memorial and the Rotunda.

Cr Riggs was opposed as ‘it did not behove the Council to pick up and carry on a scheme another committee had dropped’. 

He moved the memorial only be fenced 25ft x 15ft with posts and chains (with gaps for pedestrian access).  The guns to be mounted on cement blocks on the south side of the Memorial within the fence and until the area was ready the guns to be placed opposite the Institute.

[The original idea fenced the Rotunda & Memorial and envisaged gardens and lawn within the fence; though later the RSL suggested shrubs and gravel as a cost saving change.]

He suggested a gala day to raise the necessary funds which he estimated at about £50.  This would close the road between the Memorial and the Rotunda.

The Mayor agreed about not picking up someone else’s scheme and supported Cr Riggs and Cr Allen seconded Cr Riggs amendment, because it was cheaper that Cr Woollacott’s proposal.

Cr Woollacott thought comments about picking up other’s schemes were absurd.

Cr Riggs’ amendment was carried on the casting vote of the Mayor.

Harris, Riggs & Allen voting for and Kellock, Kellaway & Woollacott against.

The Local Government Department Inspector is to be asked to investigate the crusher.

Messrs R. McWaters & W.J. Thomas Jnr wrote to the Council asking Council to plant a row of 30 stone pine trees either side of the road that reached a dead end between their properties at Aberdeen and if it did so they would look after them.

Cr Riggs moved that it be done if it cost not more than £1.

R. Fuss was granted permission to build a verandah on the Bon Accord Hotel and a letter was sent to him pointing out that the application should have been sent in earlier.
