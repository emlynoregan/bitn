Obituary.  Suicide in Ayers St.  On Friday morning a man was found hanged from a tree in Mr Pearce’s yard next to M. Hoare’s.  He was Mr Patrick Hoare, recently employed by Mr Turner of Iron mine.  He came to the Burra Show and got tipsy, but not ‘beyond his own control’.  He was a cousin of Michael Moore and lodged with him during his stay.  On Thursday he went to Hoare’s and spent the evening.  As it was his intention to resume work on Thursday [sic: error for Friday.] he got up at 4 a.m. to saddle his horse, shouted goodbye Auntie and goodbye Mick, but instead of riding off he hanged himself.  He was well known in Kapunda as a jockey.  [Died 23 September 1898 aged 42]

Inquest on the death of Patrick Hoare, at Kooringa Hotel with P. Lane JP as coroner and T.T. Shortridge as foreman of the Jury.

Rosina Hoare confirmed the events described above and said she believed he was a single man aged c. 44.

He left a note on the kitchen table on a 10 of hearts card ‘S23. goodbye Auntie, Mick; Pat.  See horse home.’

Michael Hoare, a blacksmith with W. Henderson’s, gave evidence which added little to the above.

Patrick Walsh’s evidence as barman of the Kooringa Hotel added little beyond confirming the deceased’s drinking on Wednesday evening.

Walter Pearce of Ayers St reported seeing the deceased hanging from the tree about 3 feet off the ground and thought he must have jumped from the fence.  When he arrived others were already there and had sent for the police.

M-C Richard Joseph Jemison gave evidence corroborating the position of the body and told of marks on the tree and fence and estimated the body had been dead about four hours.

The jury decided that ‘Patrick Hoare committed suicide by hanging himself to a tree on the morning of September 23 during a fir of temporary insanity caused by the effects of drink’.
