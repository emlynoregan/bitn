Salvation Army, 8 November.  There has been more trouble in Clare with an attempt on Monday to burn down the barracks.  Floors and doors were soaked in kerosene and were set alight.  It was extinguished before much damage was done.  On Wednesday (Guy Fawx night) [sic] the Clare Skeleton Army turned out to oppose the Salvation Army, which did not march for fear of starting a riot.  Captain Carr was paraded through town in effigy astride a beer cask and later burnt. At the barracks fireworks were let off among the Salvationists and eggs were thrown by both sides.  Captain Carr left on Friday for Moonta and two buxom ‘lassies’ have taken his place.
