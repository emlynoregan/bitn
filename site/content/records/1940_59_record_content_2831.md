Town and District Councils will be asked to co-operate in compiling a list of all those who have enlisted to ensure an easy compilation of a Roll of Honour at the conclusion of the war.

The detailed reply from the Director of Mines is printed in c. 1½ columns:

The proposal suggests it is undesirable to have prospecting operations from Graves’ Shaft and a single pump was apparently contemplated by the proposers, because the Director’s reply says he is not confident that either of these steps is wise.

Driving from Morphett’s Shaft will only find payable ore if such ore exists and there is no definite proof that such is the case.

Allowance needs to be made for 3,000’ or more of cross-cutting, requiring at least £18,000.

The Director says further plant is needed above that suggested and the proposed scheme would need a second pump and second equipped shaft.  Capital of £100,000 would be needed.

The sum of £84,000 cited for main items of expenditure does not cover finding a new water supply for Kooringa.  [Presumably really for Burra.]

The cost for pumping and chlorination plant	£3,500

Annual running cost		£1,774

If Filtration is also needed		£17,450
