The most important question at the last general election was how to break up large estates, as they will hinder the due development of the colony.  Their owners could compensate the colony by making a larger contribution to the state, or sell off their estates so that a settled population could more fully use them.  Many railways inside Goyder’s Line pass through sheep walks that generate little traffic in either goods or passengers.  Though pledged to act Parliament has done nothing and in fact has permitted new estates to be built up.  Recent reports show that Land Boards allotting over 1,000 acres to one person in one or more blocks.
