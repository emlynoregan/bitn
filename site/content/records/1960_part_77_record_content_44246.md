Bob Crewes (K.R. Crewes) welcomed retired French Colonel Andre Gaugier to SA as reported in yesterday’s Advertiser.  Bob was a lieutenant in D Coy 27th Battalion AIF in WWI and was one of seven officers billeted in the French village of Le Grand Fayt late in the war.  Their billet was a partly wrecked factory and also living there were Madame Gauguir [sic] and her children Andre (11) and Paul (7) – a refugee family.  The officers became good friends with the Gauguiers [sic] sharing rations and playing games.  Andre and three of the officers met on Sunday at Outer Harbour when the Colonel disembarked from the liner Galileo for a few hours.
