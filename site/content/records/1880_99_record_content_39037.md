West: partly bearded, ordinary stature, signs of military training.  A love of being listened to rather than listening - a result of long school teaching?  A representative of glory departed.  Said to have been an able, firm and kind teacher with judgement.  Would occupy the chair with dignity, ability and commonsense.  Ruling with a rod of copper.  A [Free]mason and an Oddfellow of high degree.  Spent his youth in London.
