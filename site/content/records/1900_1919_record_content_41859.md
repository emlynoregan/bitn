Burra Cheer-up Society

John Pearce has granted the use of his building free of charge.  He also intends to provide acetylene gas as soon as possible.

Lieut. A.H. Baynes, son of Mrs Ivey of Kooringa, has been wounded in the Dardanelles.

Belgian Relief Fund now stands at £738-8-7, but Flag Day income is incomplete and the committee is aiming for £1,000.

Letter from E.M. Harcus of the Bank of Australasia affirming the loyalty of Mrs Stasinowsky in the face of some wrong reports.  Her name is of Polish origin.

Letter in support of E.J. Harris’s idea of an illustrated war souvenir book.

Burra Rifle Club AGM last Thursday.  Captain Lord in the chair.

There has been some slight increase in membership, but more are needed considering the desirability of being an experienced shot in time of war.  Captain Lord is disappointed they have only one active member from the north end of town.  Trophy winners for the last year:

Club’s Trophy (£2-2-0)	R.D. Pascoe

300 yds Trophy		E.A. Riggs

500 yds Trophy		G. Herbert
