Obituary.  Mrs E.A. Dear, mother of Mrs Fuller Sen. of Aberdeen, died on 3 October aged 87, her birthday being last Sunday 1 October.  [Probably born Emily Ann Hatchard c. 1852 and married Joseph Dear 14 April 1870 at Melrose Courthouse, but traces in Births, Marriages & Deaths CDs are confusing and the link with Mrs Fuller cannot be proved.  Mrs Fullerâ€™s maiden name sometimes appears as Dare & sometimes as Dear, but her marriage has not been found to make the link.]
