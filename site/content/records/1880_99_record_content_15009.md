His remarks have provoked much dissension and a soldier writer says the Adelaide Rifles [i.e. the paid military force of the day] should be included in the strictures.  He says the officers are ignorant and can’t maintain discipline, and the whole force is little better than ‘an armed and well dressed mob’.  

Furthermore Downes’s anticipated retirement in June next ‘will not evoke a very violent outburst of grief’.
