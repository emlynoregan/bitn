Temperance Carnival.  Last Thursday (Accession Day) was a public holiday and the IO Rechabites held a festival to promote temperance.  Miss Jessie A. Ackermann from America gave addresses.  There was a procession of about 150 members led by Wheatley’s Brass Band.  A ‘Monster Temperance Meeting’ in the Institute followed a late ‘luncheon’ at 4 p.m.  With the speaker on the platform were Revs H.P. Burgess (Wesleyan), S. Gray (Primitive Methodist), J.H. Ashton (Bible Christian), T.M. Rowe (Wesleyan), Mr F.W. Holder MP Mayor, T. Kitchen (Secretary of the Lily of the Valley Tent IOR), C.J. Pearce (Secretary of the Rose of Sharon Tent IOR), Mr J.
