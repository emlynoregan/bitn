Approval has been given for the Royal exchange Hotel to use the footpath adjacent to the premises on the north side for outdoor meals.  The liquor licence for the area applies only to people having meals.

An application by T. & D. Bull of Hanson was approved last year for a change of land use from residential to residential/business (retail antique shop) after a representation had been received from N. & T. Builder of Hanson.  Council’s decision was appealed and on 19 December the Commissioner upheld the Council’s decision if a further four conditions were added and on 12 January the matter was settled with eight conditions in all.  The total costs to Council to defend its decision amounted to just over $11,000.
