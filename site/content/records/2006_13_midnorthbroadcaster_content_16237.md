Australia Day celebrations in Burra had a cool start.  About 150 people turned out for breakfast and the Australia Day Award presentations.  Emcee Jenny Turner welcomed everyone and Rev. Michael Hillier gave a short address.  John Fuss led his [Sing Australia] Choir in patriotically themed verses throughout the event.

Mrs Joyce Lloyd accepted her certificate as Burra Citizen of the year and in accepting spoke of some of her involvements over the years with a variety of community endeavours.  She particularly mentioned working with budding young golfers.  [Photo.]

Members of the Farrell Flat Centenary Committee accepted their certificate for Event of the Year.  [Photo.]

Garry Fieldhouse spoke for the group.  [Other photos are included of people at Pickett Reserve.]
