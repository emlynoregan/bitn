Burra Copper Festival Committee

At a post mortem meeting it was decided that the next festival would be held on the October long weekend in 1988.  The financial success of the past two festivals has established a sizeable financial base.  The cost of staging this year’s event was well in excess of $10,000.  From all reports both local and elsewhere the 1986 festival was a resounding success.

[C.M. Reed as Co-ordinator went on to thank in particular:

The SES for lighting the Creek

Apex & Lions

David Kellock’s group

Burra Burra DC

Police

St John’s

Gary Tapscott & Andrew Butler on the microphones

Ross Drew & Steve Woolley for organising the 80+ float procession

The She’ll be Riot cast, technicians etc.

Peter Hall & Jim Quinn as Burra representatives on the Gulf Road Committee

And the efforts of Elly Nicholls, David Helmers, Celine Stockman and David Thamm.
