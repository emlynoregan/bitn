Obituary.  Mrs Annie Howell died on 18 November aged 85.  She was born in North Wales on 8 June 1840, the daughter of John Lewis a one-time famous temperance orator.  She came to Australia as a young girl with Lady Bathurst and made a second trip some time later when she decided to stay with a Dr & Mrs Wheeler.  She later went to America to marry a cousin to whom she was engaged, but she changed her mind and returned to SA and married John Howell, of one of Adelaide’s best known families.  They spent some years travelling, making some seven or eight trips to England.  They finally settled in Adelaide at ‘The Acacias’ later owned by Sir E.T. Smith.  On the death of his father Mr Howell had to leave and took land at Pt Lincoln and later in the north.  A series of failures ensued and after a spell in Adelaide they settled at Thistlebeds where they lived till 1896.  They then went briefly to Hamley Bridge before taking up land at Mt Bryan and then Mongolata.  Mr Howell died in 1907 and with failing health Mrs Howell came to Kooringa in 1912.  She leaves four daughters and one son: Mrs R. Lethbridge (Jamestown), Mrs J. Rowe (Aberdeen), Mrs J. Robino (Pt Augusta), Mrs T. O’Connell (Aberdeen) & Mr Harold Howell (Pt Augusta).  There are 20 grandchildren and several great-grandchildren.   ‘Joskin’ Howell the well-known jockey who died some years ago was another son.
