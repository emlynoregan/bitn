Burra Show was held last Saturday in perfect weather when a new record in overall entries was created.  It was opened by the Hon. C.R. Kelly MHR.  [His speech is printed.]  Attendance was average and the gate was down at $384 compared with $545 in 1966.  Horses in Action entries came from Broken Hill, Adelaide and beyond.  Sideshows were fewer than in the past and there was no small merry-go-round for the tiny tots.
