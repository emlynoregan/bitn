Mt Bryan East Annual Christmas Tree was held on 14 December.

After the entertainment section the headmaster, Mr Lavery said the average attendance was better this year.  In the Hallett District School Sports Class B the school came second to Hundred of Whyte School and so lost the shield they had held for so many years.  The students had been keen collectors of bottles, non-ferrous metals, paper, bones, old tyres and batteries.  22 War Savings Certificates were held to the value of Â£17-12-0 and 42/- in War Savings Stamps.

Father Christmas then came and ice cream and parlour games filled the time before supper.
