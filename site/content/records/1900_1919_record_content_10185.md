Sometime ago valuable discoveries of rock phosphate were made at the east of Burra, some 17 miles away.  Work was carried on vigorously at great expense and the area was explored to reveal a deposit that can now be traced for five miles.  The rock averages 50-60%.  The claim is known as ‘Field’s’ after F.A.S. Field, one of the promoters.  Many other claims have now been taken up in the area between 15 & 17 miles from Burra.  The problem is the cartage costs.  These are 8/- to 9/- for the road haulage and then 9/- per ton for the rail.  This leaves only about 9/- to pay for wages etc.  The erection of machinery on site has not yet been deemed economical.  We believe that if the rail cost could be halved thousands of tons could be economically moved.  It is out of reason for the railways to charge 9/- per ton from Burra to Adelaide when they charge 11/- from places double the distance.
