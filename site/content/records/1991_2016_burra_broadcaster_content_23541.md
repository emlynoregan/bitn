Gluepot

Birds Australia has entered into SAâ€™s largest Heritage Agreement covering 51,186 ha and offering protection to endangered species of native vegetation and fauna on the former Gluepot Station north of Waikerie.  The area had long been a pastoral lease, but stocking rates were generally low and the vegetation was left in good condition.
