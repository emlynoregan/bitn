A Bolt.  Two horses attached to a buggy bolted from Hon. J. Lewisâ€™s on Tuesday, going down Commercial St to the Burra Hotel and when almost there they turned, pulled away a tree guard and rushed between the hotel and a verandah post.  It was torn away and a bridle post demolished.  The pole and swing bar then broke.  One horse was caught, but the other went on.  Just then the mail-cart horse bolted, but it was slow as the wheel was chained.
