Letter

In your last issue I see that one of the parties has answered and the other partly answered my questions about the sanitary conditions of Kooringa and of Paxton Square in particular.  While the medical gentleman answers some, he evades others on the plea that those answers are included in the former.  In a strict sens perhaps this is so, but I think courtesy would have indicated to him the propriety of first calling attention of the SA Mining Assoc. manager to the condition of their property, before taking the step of complaining to the Board of Health, thereby bringing the company into public contempt in a matter of which they were quite ignorant.

Why should a complaint be made against Paxton Square when there are other places in a worse state?  The public think he should have pointed out the worst places first.  His actions must have been due to either want of judgement, lack of courtesy, or a desire to take the ‘rise’ out of the company.

The Medical Officers between them are well able to answer for themselves, but it seems strange that, while accusing Dr Cave of being reckless with logic, he himself is so unlogical [sic] as to attempt to show by figures that Paxton Square has had more than its fair share of scarlatina and typhoid, when it is a well known fact that cases of fever frequently occur in outside and isolated localities where the sanitary condition is good and from the burlesque of an inspection that has been made, this may be the case in Paxton Square, for anything the public may know to the contrary.  Before the public can come to any fair conclusion we must have a thorough inspection at which the Corporation and all interested parties should be present to see there is such a thing as a hotbed of disease in our midst.
