The opportunity to choose from four candidates is rarely offered.  I would if re-elected do my best to serve the interests of the people of Burra.  As a Councillor I have been its representative on the Tourist Committee and as Chairperson have seen it go ahead in such a way that we can be proud and have one of the most successful tourist offices in SA.  With the help of volunteers it is self supporting and costs the ratepayer nothing.  The town and district has an outstanding history and we should do all in our power to take advantage of this as it could well be the answer to the survival of the commercial core of the town.  I feel that there is an ongoing job to be done and if re-elected would certainly try to do it.  I hope I have always been ready to see beyond the town to the needs of the district as a whole.

Des. Woolley

Time limitations set by my employer prevented me from taking the step of seeking election some years ago.  I have always had an interest in Council matters and taken a strong line on local affairs.  I became interested and active in local affairs via the District Advisory Panel and Tourist Office Committee.  I hope to justify my existence on Council as there are several areas within the control of Council that, to me, are unapproachable except from within the Council.  Some principal concerns are:

Escalating rates

Revenue wasted on short term patch-up repairs

Increased staffing, machinery and costs that need to be matched by increased output and expertise.

A great deal has been achieved by the previous Council; I look forward to being part of the new Council.
