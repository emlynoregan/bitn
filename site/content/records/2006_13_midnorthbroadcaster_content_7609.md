Peter Brodie of Burra also writes on the above issue.  He considers that the upgraded Clare sports complex and a plan to upgrade the complex in the Barossa Valley this year would both have an impact on the viability of the Eudunda complex.  He is also concerned that the sale of assets like the Burra Swimming Pool, the Caravan Park and Paxton Square Cottages still seems to be on the agenda of some in Council, when he had thought these proposals had been put to bed.
