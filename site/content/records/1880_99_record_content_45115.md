Picnic.  On Thursday before Easter the private schools in the north end of town had a united picnic. A conveyance was waiting at Mrs McLaganâ€™s to take them to Mt Bryan where eatables and various sports and games were indulged in.  The Misses Rabbich provided a treat for their scholars in the schoolroom in the afternoon in the form of a tea with fruit and sweets.  Games were played and the Maypole dance performed.
