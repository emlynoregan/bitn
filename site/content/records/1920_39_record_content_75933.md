Burra Swimming Pool

There has been a suggestion to build the pool in Market Square.  At first thought it seems ridiculous, but is it?  No dressing sheds, as people could change at home â€“ a modern chain-wire fence to keep out those who did not want to pay.  It would certainly attract people to the centre of town.  In Germany the idea of a swimming pool in the centre of town is nothing new.  It would certainly generate some publicity for the town.  A well of unlimited water is on the spot and so is electric light.  The committee asks for support for the Fancy Dress Football Match next Saturday and on 9 September for a dance at Copperhouse School, with many other functions to follow.
