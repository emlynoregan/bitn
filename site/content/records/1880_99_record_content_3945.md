SAMA 36th Annual Report.  J. Beck in the chair.

For the six months ending 31 March the expenses were £470-5-0 and the income from rents and interest was £1,110-16-2, giving a profit of £640-11-2 which raised the credit balance to £25,061-6-11.

The Association has entered into negotiations for the sale of the property in England and an exchange of telegrams resulted in its sale for £100,000, of which £60,000 was payable within six months and £40,000 within two years at an interest rate of 5% p.a.  The directors are in daily expectation of the contract being executed.  Easter holidays are believed to have delayed the signing of the contract.

Messrs J. Beck, F. Rymill & S. Tomkinson were elected directors to fill vacancies on the board.
