High School Headmaster’s Report (9th and final report)

The headmaster thanked parents for their co-operation and the staff for their conscientiousness and loyalty.  He thought the children the friendliest and happiest he had encountered.

Enrolment at the start of the year was 70, but 8 left during the year.  He felt the number completing their Intermediate was lower than it should be and those going on to Leaving were only a handful.  Of a class of 36 in 1st year about 40% reach Intermediate and 10% do Leaving.  Parents would be well advised to let their children stay at school longer, for the child’s good.

The school bus proved a problem this year and at the start it did not come some days because the contractor wanted more money.  At the end of term 1 we got a Departmental bus driven by Mr Malcolm Pettet, but he could do only one term and we had trouble getting a new driver, but finally managed to get Mr A.G. Brandon, who proved very satisfactory.

Last years results were very pleasing.

Malcolm Goodridge in particular gained 9 subjects with 4 credits and had he not been a month overage would most certainly have got an exhibition.

Donald Lloyd, with 8 subjects and 1 credit, gained a Continuation Scholarship, though he did not take it up.

For the second year in succession a boy in the school, Keith Cockrum, gained top position in the state for woodwork, winning a prize from the Timber Merchants’ Assoc. – greatly helped by the excellent coaching of Mr R. Walker.  Last year seven students gained their Intermediate Certificates and two their Leaving Certificates.

In the Mid-North High School Sports Burra managed only fourth place, though Trevor Franklin and Robyn Tattersall both broke records in the hurdles.

The local sports day was held at the Racecourse in April and it was very successful, but it is likely the event will revert to Victoria Park in 1954.

At the start of the year the school won the Savings Bank Award for Thrift and £30 for library books.

The school joined in the Coronation celebrations.

A large number of trees were planted in a grove below the school and the approach to the school through the Avenue of Memory has been improved.

In March there was an excursion to Adelaide to a woollen factory and through the Adelaide Hills.

A new School Council has settled in to help the school.  Thank are particularly due to A.B. Riggs who had been a member of the High School Council for 24 years and President for the last 8.  Mr H. J.B. Jennison succeeds him.  The Secretary, Mr J. Fisher, also deserves many thanks.

The ladies of the Parents & Friends’ Assoc. under Mrs Ellis as President and Mrs Deere as Secretary are also to be thanked for their help in improving many amenities.

The High school Ball was a great success and netted over £89.

[Many other people are thanked.]

Thanks are extended to Mr Burdon & Mr Deer on the teaching staff and to Miss Hallewell.  Mr Walker, who has given excellent service as Woodwork teacher and Miss Inglis in Home Science and Needlework are both moving on.
