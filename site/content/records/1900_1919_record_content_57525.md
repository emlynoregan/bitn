Mt Bryan.  Thursday was a school holiday.  The children were given lunch in the Hall.  Then there was a procession around the town and a joyous meeting in the Hall.  Chair was I.J. Warnes, Chairman of the DC.  Mr Warnes gave a speech hoping that ‘The Great War would be the last war’ and urging all to continue to support the fighting men when they returned.  He also praised the patriotism of the area that had subscribed £21,800 to the 7th War Loan when the target had been £5,000.  He expressed concern though about returned men without experience being put on the land; many would not be in good health.  He feared many would not succeed.  He called for understanding and support for those who would return with poor health and in many cases with shattered nerves.

Mr Crewes spoke after Mr Warnes, seeing God’s hand in the victory.

Mr Warnes said he felt a statue of some sort with the names of those who had gone should be erected in Mt Bryan and he would subscribe 25 guineas towards it.
