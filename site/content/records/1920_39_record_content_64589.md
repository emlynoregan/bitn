St Mary’s Church

The annual Church and Sunday school picnic was held at Gum Creek on Saturday 7 November by kind permission of the Hon. Walter Duncan.  The weather was perfect and a large race program was held.

[Results are not printed.]

The Day of Prayer and Direct Giving, in lieu of a fete, raised £131.

The New Altar

A new altar was dedicated by the Rector on 15 November. It was designed, made and donated by Mr H.E. Fuss in memory of his late wife.  It is built in blackwood and is a handsome acquisition to the church furniture.

The Bishop of Adelaide Dr H.N. Thomas will visit Burra next weekend.  While here he will dedicate an Oak Bishop’s Chair in memory of the late Mrs Bright.
