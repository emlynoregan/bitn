John D. Cave writes to clarify his view of the new assessment.  He goes into complicated detail, but at least is clear when he says the 1884 assessment was £15,944-2-0 and for 1885 is £15,907-4-0 after appeals were heard.

Cave says the papers left by Mr Jones showed an error of £100 in adding up and sundry other smaller errors.

He says that Cave’s assessment for 1884 of £15,944-2-0 compares with Jones’s of 1883 of £14,450-3-3 which was an increase of £1494 and resulted in an increased income, based on a 1/- in the £ rate, as follows:

Increase due to increased assessment	£74-14- 0

Plus the Government Subsidy	40- 0- 0

Plus the health rate @ 3d in £	18-13- 6

Total		133- 7- 6

Less*		35- 0- 0

Leaving the town to the good	£98- 7- 6

Cave then goes on in a similar complicated process to illustrate that the loss of income by using the new assessment will be £39-5-0.

[* This £35 was not explained until the next paper when a correction made it clear that it was Cave’s fee for writing up the assessment.]
