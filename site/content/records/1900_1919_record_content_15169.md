M-C Grosser was given a farewell social on Friday night by members of the Masonic Lodge in a large room adjoining the hall and there was a large attendance despite the rough weather with both wind and rain from 7 p.m.  Mrs Grosser was presented with a handsome silver sugar basin, afternoon spoons and tongs and a set of carvers and cutlery in a case.  Vocal and other items by ladies and gentlemen were followed by refreshments.  With his departure for Angaston the town loses a courteous and capable officer, who has done some very clever work in the 3 years 8 months he has been here.
