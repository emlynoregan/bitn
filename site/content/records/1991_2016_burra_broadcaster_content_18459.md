Burra Show Society AGM was held on 23 February and had only a small attendance.  It was consequently impossible to fill all positions required.  Patron is Ron Shipard, with Peter Stockman as Senior Vice-President.  Len Newcombe continues as Secretary-Treasurer.  The positions of President and Junior Vice-President remain to be filled along with Industrial Sites convenor and a number of steward positions.
