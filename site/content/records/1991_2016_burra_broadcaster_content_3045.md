Accident.  [A note in the paper of 2 February 1994 on page 7 had reported that someone had fallen through a roof into a cellar and had to be rescued by SES and ambulance officers.  This cryptic comment is clarified in this paper.]  Bob Skinner is recovering from the injuries sustained when he recently fell into a cellar.
