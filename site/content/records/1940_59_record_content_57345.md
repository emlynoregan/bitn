Sir Philip A. McBride

Senator P.A. McBride received a knighthood in the New Year Honours List.  He is a Kt Commander of St Michael & St George.  He was born in Burra and joins other local knights such as Sir Frederick Holder, Sir Hubert Wilkins and Mr Essington Lewis. [Sic!]  He is the son of Mr & Mrs A.J. McBride, pioneer pastoralist.  The family still owns the properties Braemar & Faraway Hill in the district.  Sir Philip entered politics at a relatively young age as LCL Member for Grey in the House of Representatives and soon rose to Cabinet rank.  He lost his seat in a landslide to Labor, but at the following election was elected a Senator on the District of Wakefield and has since continued to play a big part in state and national affairs.  [Details of his political life are disputed by Noel Tiver, 81, 2, 20 Jan. 1953, page 7.]
