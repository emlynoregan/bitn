Court, 11 May.

On 3/5 at Millerton Mrs Caroline Jones ‘distributed an unlimited amount of billingsgate’ on Mrs Wahlert’s daughter.  A little later she appeared and ‘essayed the task of telling the latter [Mrs Wahlert] the pedigree of Hetty Wahlert’ and she then told Mrs Gentle ‘something she did not know before, and couldn’t understand when she was told’.  Evidence was taken from Amelia Walker and Mrs Lepley.  Mrs Jones then gave evidence that it was all lies and actually Henrietta Wahlert had ‘sulphured the surrounding atmosphere’, but her version lost some credibility when Hetty Wahlert interjected: ‘You’re a liar Mrs Jones.’

‘Yes I am, just like you!’ said Mrs Jones.

David Rees Jones said he had heard the quarrel, but there ‘was nothing out of the way mentioned’.

Mrs Jones was fined £1-17-0.
