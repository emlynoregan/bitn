Obituary.  Miss B.V. (Ciss) Dempsey died at Clare Hospital on 16 July.  She was aged 44 and was the youngest daughter of the late Mr & Mrs Thomas Dempsey of Mintaro and late of Gum Creek.  She has lived at Gum Creek since her parents moved there when she was young.  A severe bout of pneumonia some three years ago left her with heart trouble.  Three brothers and four sisters survive: John (Clare), Thomas (Hanson), James C. (Gum Creek), Mrs T.J. Horgan (Glenelg), Mrs T.J. McInerny (St Peters), Mrs Martin Hogan (Leighton & Miss Ann Dempsey (Gum Creek).

Page 3 says she was Bridget Veronica and the daughter of the late Thomas & Mary Dempsey.

[Births & Deaths registrations for this family are too complex to be readily unravelled.  The Mrs Martin Hogan connection suggests the Bridget born to Thomas & Mary nee Erwin born 15 July 1889 at Upper Wakefield, making her age 48.  The births of Mesdames Horgan & McInerney cannot readily be traced to help in confirmation, nor can those of the brothers, though a John and the Miss Ann would fit with the 1889 suggestion.]
