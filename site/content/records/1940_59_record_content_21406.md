Burra Town Council, 23 April

The Minister of Education advised he had consented to the sale of the Institute to the Council.

It was resolved to instruct the solicitor to draw up a Memorandum of Transfer.

Cr Bevan asked if the library was to have three rooms in the building, free of rent.

Cr Kellaway said the Council would take over all the building and provide room for the library.  The Mayor said the Solicitor had advised that the Council had to find room for the library.  Cr Bevan said Council would have to watch the agreement.  He did not think the Library Committee was entitled to free rent of rooms.

The Mayor said three rooms seemed a lot when the Council had only one.

It was resolved to write to the Education Department asking if it was agreeable to subsidising a Swimming Pool for the children on a £ for £ basis.
