The Wheat Traffic.  The editor writes citing the facts of the apparent blockage on the Northern Line.  Three weeks earlier the railways advised that they could arrange to move 9,000 tons per week.  The statistics are:

Week ending 18 January	6197 tons

25 January	6787

1 February	6068

8 February	6907

And these figures are for total traffic; not just wheat.

We are fortunate that we have not experienced the all too common thunderstorms for this time of year, or much wheat lying around waiting to be moved, would have been damaged.
