Burra Town Hall Pictures Opened

The biggest community project ever was opened by the Mayor, Mr W. Carpenter, on Saturday, when he declared open the Burra Town Hall Pictures.  There were representatives from the Film Distribution Houses and the engineering firm, which had installed the plant and guests from other communities.  Burra now has one of the best projection plants outside of the metropolitan area.  It was built by the Radio Corporation of America.  It is capable of handling the new development in 3-dimensional effects.  The sound equipment is almost perfect.  All moving parts are glass covered and each machine’s arc light has a separate transformer, doing away with the motor generator plant.  Arcs for the carbons are automatically fed by small electric motors.  Operators can view the position of carbons by remote vision controls.  Projectionist Nankivell says comparing the new with the old projectors is like comparing driving a Model T Ford with the latest motor cars.  The Mayor said that in this Jubilee Year of the Corporation, this was an important venture for the Council.  The previous operators had been showing pictures in Burra for 30 years.  They finished a show on Saturday night and had the Bio Box clear on the following Monday, for the installation of the new plant.  Other Councils with similar schemes had been very helpful – Pt Elliott in particular.  About £3,100 was borrowed in 1920 to complete the building of the Dress Circle and to alter the supper room and changing rooms.  Over 30 years this principal and interest had grown to something like £7,000 and the debt remained at about £3,100.  Cr Jennison supported the Mayor’s remarks.  Mr Blood, of Paramount Pictures, pointed out that the profit would go to pay off the Town Hall debt and then go to other town amenities.  He felt that Mr Jennison and Mr Davies had chosen well in selecting the program for the coming twelve months.  After the show the Mayor and Committee entertained about 60 guests to supper in the CWA Room.  Supper arrangements were by Mr P.W. Carpenter.  Guests included representatives of film distribution firms and Mr Minear of RCA, who installed the plant.  Cr Baulderstone said this was the biggest community effort he had seen in twenty years’ residence in the town.  Mr W. Nankivell said that not once in the previous thirty years had they had a serious breakdown and he hoped the new machinery would do as well.  He would certainly do his best for it.
