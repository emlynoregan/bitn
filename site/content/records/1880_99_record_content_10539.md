Editorial on the waterworks.

An effort to get sufficient guarantees to take the water has now resulted in the total reaching about £320.  SAMA has not yet replied and one or two others and it is probable the target will be reached.  As more people come in the price, now set at 6/- per 1,000 gallons, can be reduced.
