Burra Town Council, 16 May

There were various problems with trimming and removing trees.  The Telephone Dept sought compensation for the cutting of 30 wires when a tree limb fell during removal.  This will be contested.

E.J. Harris was granted permission to remove a nearly dead tree from in front of his shop.

T.H. Woollacott was given permission to make alterations to a house in Bridge terrace and to build an Isolation Ward for the Hospital.

Timber from tree removal is to be taken to the Council Depot.  [Its fate after that is unclear.]

Trees are to be ordered on the Inspectorâ€™s suggestion.

Various road and path matters were approved.
