Ballast Quarry.  The SAR are to construct a siding from the main line at a point north of the large cutting in J. Ford’s (Quarry) paddock to run along the existing reef of stone for a further quantity of ballast.  We hope it will be in action soon for the sake of the many locally unemployed.

[The previous issue had said that the Government had a three year lease on the quarry from Mr Ford.]
