BCS.  A first draft farm plan for Brewery Hill has been prepared.

The intention is to divide the land into three paddocks according to soil type and topography.

Water supply around the land will be improved.

The Agricultural Committee has proposed three livestock enterprises for the block:

A self-replacing Merino flock of c. 50 ewes.

A flock of first cross ewes of c. 50 that can produce prime lambs.

A flock of meat goats of c. 50 does to produce prime kid.  (The goats to be trained to an electric fence.)
