Inspector Gray brought a strange case in attempting to get a conviction against H.J. Gurr, a marine store dealer, for not having his name on his dray.  The dray was hired from Penn & Co. of Adelaide, which Gurr had stated.  Since there was no case to answer J.P. Snow SM took a dim view and awarded 6/- costs for the dayâ€™s wages lost.
