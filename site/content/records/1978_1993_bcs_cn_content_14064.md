Burra Kindergarten.  Session time changes.  The Kindergarten is considering changing the Friday morning session to Tuesday afternoon.  This would mean sessions on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday mornings and Tuesday afternoons.  This would enable out-of-town children to attend two sessions on a Tuesday.  Feedback from stakeholders is sought.
