Burra Institute held its AGM on Tuesday.  Retiring President, Max Pearce, took the chair.

The President reported a year with a markedly better income than in 1934, but also with higher expenditure due to much needed renovations both inside and outside.

The secretary reported that in the Institute Library on 	31 December 1934 there were 7564 books

and on 	31 December 1935 there were 7564 books

There was a slight decrease in membership due to removals.

31 December 1934	Double Memberships	53	31 December 1935	Double Memberships	59

Single Memberships	153		Single Memberships	122

Total	206		Total	181

During the year a contract was made with Theatregraph Pictures for exclusive rights to show pictures at the Institute for five years, at quite a satisfactory rate for the committee.

A ball was held in May in honour of the visit of the Governor and Lady Dugan and this netted £33-16-8.

A poorly patronised concert organised by the committee netted £8-2-6.

The Institute classes under conductor G.E. Dane assisted in a very successful Christmas Concert at the Burra Hospital.  A mannequin parade in conjunction with Messrs Bence Ltd netted £7-3-0 for the Institute.

In the year the Committee purchased a fine new piano for £100, less £20 allowed for the old one.  The whole of the front of the building has been renovated.  The interior of the Council Chamber has been redecorated and with the new furniture organised by the Mayor, there is now a Council Chamber to be proud of.  Elected were: President, A.B. Riggs; Vice-President, E.F. Marsden; Treasurer, M. Pearce and Secretary, M. Bednall.
