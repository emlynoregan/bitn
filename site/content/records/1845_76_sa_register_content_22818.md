Fencing Sheep Runs.  A letter from ‘Bucolicus’ printed in the Sydney Mail recently is reprinted.

[The writer approves of fencing cattle runs because cattle are apt to work their way back to where they were bred and this is prevented.  They also quieten down and fatten better.  He does not think the same can be said of sheep runs, based on his experience and reports from the Riverina.  The squatters expect that with fencing they will save the shepherds’ wages and keep, while the increase in sheep numbers due to lambing and the income from meat and wool will remain as before.  They fail to add in the cost of removing dogs.  Then there is the capital cost of the fencing and the ongoing cost of servicing a loan.  Water supplies may also have to be provided in the paddock.  The writer alleges that lambing rates are lower and the wool of inferior quality.  They will also find it necessary to employ more men at mustering times for cutting, weaning and shearing.  Such men will not be readily available.  Towns also tend to dwindle as the population in the area declines.  Sheep in paddocks are timid and raced off when disturbed, thus fattening less well.]
