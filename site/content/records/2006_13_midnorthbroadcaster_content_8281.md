Ernie Dingo, one of Australia’s most popular television personalities and his family have signed up for this year’s AGL Bush to Burra Cattle Drive.  This starts at Gum Creek on 1 October and ends at Canowie on 5 October.  Ernie showed interest while visiting Clare in June for the Clare Valley Regional Tourism Awards.  The drive will raise money for a variety of health services in the Mid North.  Last year the event raised $21,000 and an estimated $25,000 went back to community groups who catered for the event in various ways.  Participants pay $250 a day if they supply their own horse or a horse can be provided for a further $150 a day.  [Photo of Ernie Dingo.]
