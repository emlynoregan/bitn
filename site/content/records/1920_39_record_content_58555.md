Obituary.  Henry Walker died at his Kingston Street home on 4 November after a brief illness aged 85.  The cause of death was pneumonia.  He was born at Ayr in Scotland on 10 November 1850, the youngest son of Mr & Mrs James Walker.  His parents decided to migrate to Australia in 1876 and their family decided to accompany them.  Mr Harry Walker had married Miss Grace Hope of Dumfrieshire Scotland in 1870 and they migrated with their small daughters Margaret and Agnes.  They came in the Bencleugh.  On arrival they came almost straight to Burra and have lived in Kooringa ever since.  Mr Walker was first employed by Messrs Sara & Dunstan of Aberdeen.  Leaving them, he worked for the Unicorn Brewing Co. until it disbanded about 1903.  Later their large buildings were demolished and four dwelling houses have been erected there on the old brewery property.  When the brewery was working scores of mothers used to make their own bread and we believe that the bakers also in the town procured the yeast necessary for bread and cakes, from the brewery.  Many folk today, then scholars at the Burra School, can recall running the flight of steps to the cool cellar and leaving the yeast can with Mr Walker, who was in charge, and collecting it again after school.  Mr Walker’s quiet, kindly, but firm manner with his little customers has never been forgotten, no one ever feared him.  That characteristic was uppermost in his dealings with his fellows; consequently he was highly respected by everyone.  When the brewery closed down Mr Walker became a member of the house staff of the Burra Burra Hospital, a position he held for about 18 years, when he decided to retire.  He took a keen interest in town matters and was at one time a member of the Town Council.  Until the last twelve months his health was good.  His last illness was of only a few days’ duration. His wife predeceased him in 1924.  He leaves three daughters: Mrs Josiah Rosewall of Kooringa, Mrs Joe Geach of Boulder WA and Mrs Jean Geach of Alberton.  There are 12 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.
