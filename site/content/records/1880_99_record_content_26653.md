Ratepayers’ Meeting.  A meeting of North Ward ratepayers was convened by Cr Tiver in response to a requisition.  It met at the German Chapel last Saturday and c.16 attended.  A. Bartholomæus took the chair.

Mr Rayner proposed Mr W.T. Rabbich to replace Cr Killicoat who is to contest the Mayoralty.  Cr Tiver 2nd.  Carried.

Cr Tiver proposed Mr T. Davis as W.T. Rabbich’s colleague.  Mr Rabbich 2nd.  Carried.

Mr Rabbich will stand, but Mr Davis is considering the matter.

Cr Sampson was present, though not a ratepayer of the ward.  He said he had always been opposed to the Waterworks and said Mr Brown and Mr Rayner had been instrumental in getting them.

‘Mr Rayner had been almost individually responsible for them and a greater wrong was never perpetrated in the town of Burra that those waterworks’.

Mr Rayner asked the chairman to make a note of those words.  The chairman:

‘No I will take no note of anything.’

Cr Sampson was sure he would be elected Mayor and The Avenue, waterworks and tree watering would be dealt with at a general meeting of ratepayers.
