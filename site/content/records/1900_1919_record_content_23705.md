Obituary.  James Tiver died at Aberdeen on Friday, aged 80.  He arrived in SA in April 1855 from Bristol in the David Malcolm and came to Burra as contractor to the Smelting Works.  He erected the first buildings in the town of any note as well as bridges and the making of roads.  He constructed the black bridge over the creek in Aberdeen.*  He took over the Aberdeen Railway Stores and ran them for over 40 years.  He also bought land between Hallett and Yarcowie and secured Tiverton and Banbury.  He was an earnest Christian who occupied many of the offices of the Redruth Methodist Church and was for over 50 years the Superintendent of the Sunday school, relinquishing it two years ago.  He represented the Redruth Circuit at Conferences.  He was also a JP, a Member of Loyal Aberdeen Lodge of Oddfellows.  A cortege of 70-80 vehicles followed the coffin to the cemetery in one of the longest funeral seen in Burra for some time.

He reached Burra in a bullock dray and once went to Wallaroo to erect a mine building when water cost £1 for 33 gallons.  Mrs Tiver was an invaluable helpmate.  Once on going to join her husband at Wallaroo they had to erect a cottage for her and the children in one day.  He leaves five daughters: Mrs Gray (Glenelg), Mrs E.F. Opie & Mrs A. Sara (Broken Hill), Mrs J.G. Sara (Aberdeen Railway Stores) & Mrs Stock (Campbelltown) and 43 grandchildren & 8 great-grandchildren.

Kooringa News, 26 June

Monday was a public holiday as mid-summer’s day (or rather mid-winter’s day).  There was a dinner commemorating the anniversary of the Miners & Tradesmen’s Club.  The Masonic Lodge also held a dinner and the following day saw the opening of the new Redruth Bridge.  The work for this was commenced on 25 January and work proceeded steadily except on one occasion when workmen had to wait for the delivery of material.  It is constructed on the laminated arch principle and has a span of 68 ft 6 inches, being built askew so that the span on the square is 60 ft.  The abutments and wing walls are of coarse hammer-dressed rubble masonry.  From these spring four laminated arches or ribs, bearing a framed wooden superstructure, surmounted by the roadway, which is formed of two transverse thicknesses of three-inch gum planking laid diagonally.  The side rails are of white painted deal.  The whole reflects great credit on the builders; Messrs Burgoyne & Baker for the carpentry and Messrs Tiver and Cole for the masonry.

For the Redruth Bridge standing in 1909 the contract went to Duncan Grant and he is mentioned in the paper throughout the construction of the bridge in 1879 and at its opening.  See Burra Record  II. 77. 19 December 1879, page 2.  This bridge survived into the 21st century, though only as a footbridge after the Morgan Road by-pass was constructed in the 1980s.]
