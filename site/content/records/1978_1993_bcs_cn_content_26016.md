Burra High School.  The reunion of WWII students was a great success.  It attracted nearly 150 old scholars and their partners to the Sports Complex last Saturday.  It included a visit to the much changed school building.  Three former staff members also attended: Reuben Goldsworthy, Bethel Smith and Alan Hickinbotham.
