The SA Stud Merion Expo attracted one of the largest crowds since the inception of centralising the field days on the Burra Oval.  Visitors came from across Australia.  35 studs participated.

Elders Ram of the Year went to East Bungaree.

Elders Pair of the Year went to Greenfields.

The pair of ram lambs, objective measurement class was won by Roemakhita for the second year in succession.

Australian Year of the Farmer Roadshow was at the Elders SA Stud Merino Expo last Tuesday.  It featured an interactive display, childrenâ€™s painting area and merchandise stands.  It aimed to provide locals with information on the importance of agricultural industries and also to promote careers in the sector.  Over the next 12 months, nine exhibition vehicles will travel 56,000 km and attend more than 300 events across the nation.

Founder of the Australian Year of the Farmer, Philip Bruem, said it was a great way to gain recognition for the Australian Farmer and to promote the importance of the sector, showcasing farmers as world leaders in their own right.
