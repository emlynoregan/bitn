Mongolata Sports were held on 11 October and were largely attended by people from Burra, World’s End, Robertstown and various stations.  Events were run for all: tiny tots, boys, girls, ladies, men and old buffers and the Burra Brass Band enlivened the day.  Results are printed.

All the kiddies got a bag containing cake, a saveloy & roll and an orange.
