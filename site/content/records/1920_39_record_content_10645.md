Burra Show Society.  Annual Report

During the year the society lost a great supporter with the death of J.Q. Hogan.

The season was good both for farmers and pastoralists.  Prices for sheep and lambs were good.  Wool prices are high and demand is good.  Cattle are not an important product in the district and cattle prices are very low.

The Dog Trials were a great success.  Other sports on the last day helped to draw people and the trials are now paying their way.

The Annual Show on 25 October was a great success with record entries in most classes.  Exhibits were better displayed.  Finances are sound.  The year began £30 in credit and ends about £13 in credit with some £20 spent on improvements, but nothing was paid off debentures or interest.  Wages of £40 is an excessive amount caused by the amount of material that has to be shifted each show.  We need more money to improve the show.  The Salvation Army took charge of luncheon.
