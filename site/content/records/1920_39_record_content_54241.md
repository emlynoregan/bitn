Burra Seaside Trip Committee held a public meeting on Monday evening where Alwin Pearce Secretary & Treasurer said the credit balance was slightly over £200.  It was decided to have a trip this year to Semaphore.  The committee received advice from SAR that they could provide a special train at last year’s rates on 16 February and this offer has been accepted.
