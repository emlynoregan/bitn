Obituary.  A.J. (Jack) Berryman died at his Leighton home on 27 May aged 75.  He was born at Yongala in 1880 and spent his childhood there.  About 1905 he was married at Jamestown and came to this district to take up farming at Braefoot.  There were seven children: Colin (Gawler), William (Adelaide), Phyllis Mrs Irvine (Adelaide), Francis (deceased), Donald (Melbourne), Elizabeth Mrs Leibie (Ardrossan) and Ross (Leighton).  Mr Berryman’s only hobby and main interest was horse racing, at which he had considerable success.  He won the first steeplechase held at Clare and another horse won nine out of ten handicaps entered there.  ‘Chesteress’ owned by him, but raced by his brother F.M. Berryman, started three times in one day at a Burra meeting in about 1909, coming second in the hurdles, second in the ‘flying’ and won the ‘welter’.  In 1912 he and his family moved to Hill River where he took up land.  His wife died in 1941 and after 32 years there he then moved to live within a mile of his old home at Braefoot.  He enjoyed good health till a fall from a horse about seven years ago, but he remained working on his farm till a few months prior to his death.

[John Wesley Berryman born 21 April 1880 Yongala.]
