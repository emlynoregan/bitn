Anzac Day in Burra was celebrated with a Memorial & Intercession Service on Sunday.  Before the service there was a parade comprising the cadets under Lieut. E.M. Cox, Boy Scouts under Scoutmaster J.

Finch, Mr Winfield (Salvation Army), Mr Buxton (new member for the district), the St Mary’s Choir, the two Methodist Choirs and some returned soldiers.
