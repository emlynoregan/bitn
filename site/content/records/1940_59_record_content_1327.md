As a result of the efforts of the RSL & FFCF nearly £500 was taken.  Much was due to the efforts of the RSL Hon. Sec. Mr H.E. Fuss and his assistant Mr C.V. Preiss and also to those of Mr & Mrs Stanley Hawker.  The success of the fete owed much to the work of Mrs Hawker and Mrs Andrew Tennant of the FFCF and the RSL Wives Group.  The local CWA entertained Sir Hubert & Lady Hudd at luncheon. (He had been invited to open the day’s activities.)  A list of responsible workers and of results is published.  The fete is described in considerable detail as well.
