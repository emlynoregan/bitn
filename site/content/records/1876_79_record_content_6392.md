Letter to Editor from Edward Lipsett re the Burra Corporation and the Mayor. He wrote to say he believed that at the municipal elections last December he felt he was not served by ratepayers with fairness. Subsequent actions of Council had confirmed this.

When he left the chair the Corporation was in a healthy state with no debt and incoming rates free to do the work needed. He had used his casting vote when assuming office to see Mr Holder elected as Town Clerk. This action, he said, gave serious offence in some quarters and in no small degree tended to lessen the number of votes polled in his favour. Mr Holder's subsequent actions confirmed his trust in his appointment.

The actions of the present Mayor have resulted in the very serious circumstances which have befallen the Council and are the result of the Mayor's inexperience in business. He has failed to supervise the Clerk - the idea of allowing the Town Clerk to keep the sum of £49 in his cash box.  In Lipsett's term of office the Clerk banked everything over £10. The Mayor's incompetence was shown right at the start when he gave a casting vote in favour of an amendment that nullified his first vote. Through his neglect the Council has lost between £300 and £400 of Govt. subsidy. Look at the bridge opening. Lipsett says that he and the first Mayor [P. Lane] `worked hard to get that splendid structure, and it stands today a great memorial to our labours.'
