Obituary.  Mr George Lawn died in Adelaide on 7 September was a former well-known Burra resident.  He was born at Robertstown in 1875, the third and youngest son of the late Mr & Mrs Henry Lawn of Baldina.  He was educated at Burra Public school and Baldina School and then helped his father on the farm.  In 1897 he married Miss Jean Lihou, eldest daughter of the late Mr & Mrs Henry Lihou of Burra.  They lived at Broken Hill for some years before returning to Burra, where Mr Lawn was employed by Messrs Drew & Crewes Ltd and later set up a butchering business on his own account.  This he sold after some years and worked for Mr Andrew Tennant.  He was keenly interested in sports and active in many aspects of town life.  He retired to Prospect ten years ago, where he enjoyed good health until the brief illness leading to his death.  He is survived by a widow, a son-in-law and one grandson.  His only child, Gladys, Mrs Perce Herbert, died in November 1937.  He was buried at the North Road Cemetery. [Nailsworth.]
