Booborowie.  The Christmas tree of 19 December is reported and also the New Year’s Ball where the MC was Frank Hogan.  Many farmers have sown Japanese millet again after the depredations of the grasshoppers.  [Details occupy ½ column.  This delayed report was rewritten after the original was lost in the fire.]
