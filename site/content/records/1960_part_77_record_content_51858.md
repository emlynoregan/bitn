Bowls.  Burra members are discussing the possibility of a new clubhouse.  Two proposals to either demolish and rebuild or to extend the present building were considered at a recent committee meeting.

At the AGM last Tuesday elected were: Patron, Dudley Jacka; President, Edgar Pietsch; Vice-Presidents, Darrell Field & Brian Riggs; Secretary, Wally Scott and Treasurer, Barry Biggs.

The plans of clubhouse changes presented by Dudley Jacka for consideration are available for inspection at the clubhouse and constructive criticism is being sought.
