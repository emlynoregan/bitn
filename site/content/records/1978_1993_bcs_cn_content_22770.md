The Burra Show Society will soon circulate a questionnaire about the showâ€™s future.  While horses in action, sheep, wool, birds etc. are well supported, the pavilion sections have been declining.  Competitive displays there are becoming difficult to mount.  Is the show to be viable into the future?
