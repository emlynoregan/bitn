This was convened to consider Cr West’s proposal for a loan of £500.  He said he hoped he would have support since every £ of the general rate used to reduce outstanding debts was the loss of another pound which could have attracted subsidy.  The proposal is very simple.  The probable curtailment or abolition of the Government Grant-in-Aid is Government policy and we would be foolish to lose any portion of it while it remains available.

Cr Ridgway pointed out that the borrowing of £500 secured by the Parklands rates would enable the paying off of the debt in about seven instead of nine years, due to the reduced rate of interest and would allow the Council to spend about £500 more this year than would otherwise be possible and so if Cr West would accept a loan against the Parklands rates he would have Ridgway’s support - but not if it were against the general rate.

Cr West readily agreed and so did the Mayor.

[There then follows a printed report on the Recreation Ground Account, which demonstrates how the application of the Parklands rate to reducing the debt would see it vanish in seven years. Note though this assumes that all the said rates go to reduce debt and the Parklands rate must have been levied because there were Parkland expenses!]

The loan would not increase indebtedness, but would enable them to get money at lower interest.

Cr Coglin had been convinced by the argument and so was Cr Symons.  Carried unanimously.

Ratepayers’ approval is to be sought at a meeting on 31 March.

Ordinary meeting 21 March.

Tobacco trees in the cemetery are to be destroyed.

The mayor reported that an old shaft had made an appearance near the pumping station.  The works Committee will investigate and act on this and another nearby shaft also complained of.

The Hydraulic Engineer sent a tracing showing the water mains, stopcocks and fireplugs in the town.

The Hydraulic Engineer wrote to say no changes could be made in the engine as it had already left England and to say the hydrant had been sent.

The Mayor said the understanding was that the engine referred to was to be disposed of and a new and larger one substituted.

Local Board of Health

Mr Forder would take all the night soil and prepare trenches and pay 2/6 a load.  The nightmen were allowed the 2/6 to compensate for having to take it the extra distance from Kooringa.

Letter from J. Cooksley, writing again on UK Government policy.

Letter from W.R. Ridgway who writes at length. [c. ¾ column] He takes issue with ‘Bourgeois’, or at least he would except that he ‘failed to understand the strange tirade’

[Although Ridgway takes an inordinate number of words to say so, I agree with him that ‘Bourgeois’ (or Boar-jaw, as Ridgway calls him) is rather obscure.  Most of Ridgway’s letter is however, a lot of words about very little.]
