Centenary of Ironmine Methodist Church

About 400 people attended the celebrations last Sunday.  Rev. C.L.H. Pitman a former minister in the Redruth Circuit preached the occasional address to a congregation which packed the church and overflowed into a covered area of shade outside.  The Burra Circuit Choir sang the anthem and Mrs Mavis Satchell sang a solo.  Luncheon was provided by the Ironmine Ladies.  In the afternoon people with a past association with the church were given the opportunity to speak and Mrs G. Murray and Mr N. Baynes were the first to contribute.  Afternoon tea followed.  The Trust Steward made a statement welcoming those who had returned for the occasion.

[Check who it says this was because in 93, 12, 30 Mar. 1971 a correction is made to say it was Ray Lloyd.]

The Lloyd family have been connected with the Ironmine Church for many years, my father holding the position of Trust Secretary for 25 years and I have held it since 1948.  Today not many families are left in the immediate locality who take an active interest in the church.  The congregation, small as it is, has looked forward to the centenary, the celebration of which is an ambitious undertaking. A letter received this week from retired Congregational Minister Rev. W.R. Trestrail says it was his grandfather, the late Philip Oates, who gave the land on which the church was built and that it was his late mother, Elizabeth Mary Oates, who played the organ when the church was opened.  It seems the Oates family featured well in the earliest days of this churchâ€™s life.  It is known that the father of Mr Percy Oates of Burra, the late John G. Oates, carted the first load of stone to the site.
