C.P. Mountford, the noted anthropologist, was born in Hallett and educated there until the age of 11.  Mr Mountford passed through Burra on Friday on his way to inspect some cave paintings in a remote part of Wilpena Pound.  As a colleague of Mr Pollnitz he was present also at the opening of the caravan park.  He describes himself as an amateur anthropologist, but has spent forty years in study and practical research.  One of his best-known books is entitled Brown Men and Red Sand.
