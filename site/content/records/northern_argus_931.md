We are now in a position to contribute $40,000 towards the third stage with a cost of $120,000.

The Council has arranged for a loan of $80,000 for the balance, which will be repaid from our profits and will cost the ratepayers nothing, while making the property more valuable.

A complete financial statement is rendered at each monthly meeting of the board and a copy is forwarded to Council.

A yearly statement is presented at the annual public meeting attended by very few ratepayers.

‘Stop grumbling and uttering false statements among the people of our community.  I am available at most times to answer queries in a sensible manner.’
