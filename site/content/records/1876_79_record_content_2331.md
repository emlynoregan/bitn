Speaking at the Redruth Wesleyan anniversary Dr. Brummitt, a newcomer from England, pointed out that anniversaries in UK were once a year, but in SA some congregations managed to have them up to four times a year and this one fell 2 years 8 months after foundation! He was concerned about the lack of young men in the church compared with the situation in UK.
