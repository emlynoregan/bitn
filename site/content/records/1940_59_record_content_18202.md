Burra Red Cross held its AGM 11 July.

The main activity for the year was support for the Red Cross & FFCF Shop 109.  This provided afternoon tea on Friday’s despite rationing and permit difficulties.  Red Cross half-share amounted to £174-8-2 for the 12 months.  On the 3rd Friday in the month CWA members run the shop and on the 4th Friday Soldiers’ Wives Group.

£125 was donated to the Red Cross Annual Appeal.  A Christmas Gift & Clothing Shop raised £16-15-6.

Mrs R.H. Smith consented to act as Treasurer when Mrs C. Butler had to leave.
