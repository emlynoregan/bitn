Letter from John Worrall of Eudunda re two recent letters from Mr J. Shipard.

On 1 August he says Mr Shipard’s Letter fails to tell the whole story –

City folk get more services, better footpaths, cheaper transport, shopping centres, more banks, more doctors, BUT ALSO more pollution, more crime, more drugs, more road congestion and more stress and fear.

Why did Mr Shipard move to Burra from the city?  City Councils have ten times the ratepayers and one fiftieth of the land area to serve – they should be able to do more.

Mr Shipard’s second letter was more positive and if his facts are correct, he presents a valid alternative.  Mr Worrall challenges him to research the Council’s income and expenditure in detail and present us with informed proposals to get more services and pay lower rates.
