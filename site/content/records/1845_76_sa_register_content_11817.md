Kooringa News, 4 August

On Tuesday 30 July Mr Townsend of the firm of Wicksteed, Bitting, Townsend & Co. conducted an auction of land for Mr Nelson.  The Township of Nelson was offered.  After spirited bidding all but five allotments were sold and we hear that the proprietor has since had offers for those that are higher than on the day.

At 5 p.m. the same day allotments in the Town of Yarwood, some three miles south of Kooringa on the Adelaide Road, were offered and a great number of allotments were purchased.  Altogether it has been the most successful land sale held at Burra and has astonished the local tradesmen, who have been complaining of the dullness of trade.

A new footbridge has been erected in Chapel Street, chiefly owing to the exertions of Mr William Vercoe, who gathered subscriptions for it.  It is well built and a credit to its builder, Mr John Stevens.  It will be of great service to those attending either church or chapel as well as to school children.

The Redruth and County of Burra Building Society held its AGM at Redruth on Wednesday evening 3 August.  The accounts showed a credit balance of £159.  Three shares were sold.  The first two brought £14 and the third £12-15-0.
