H.C. Hodby, Secretary of the Burra Local Centre of the University of Adelaide, is calling a meeting of parents on 9 November to arrange supervision of the public exams.  Mr C.R. Hodge, Registrar of the University, said recently on a visit that the local centre at Burra would have to close unless more interest in University matters was shown.  This would mean students travelling to Riverton or Adelaide to sit for exams.
