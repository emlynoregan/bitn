ETSA Power

ETSA has advised the Town Council that due to delay caused by the Burra Electric Power Co. Ltd in deciding in the transfer, it will be at least two years before the Trust takes over.  While the Burra Electric Supply has done a splendid job in maintaining a continuous supply, people have all dreamed of expanding their use of electric appliances, whether in the home, workshop or in industry and now it looks as if they will have to continue dreaming for at least two years.  What makes it harder is that other and smaller towns in the near area are being supplied with ‘Trust’ electricity and have been for some time.  Their residents are enjoying added electrical conveniences.  The Trust now says that owing to financial constraints it will not be able to undertake the necessary extension of the distribution system for at least two years.  The Trust will be asked to assist in maintaining electricity supply during that period.
