Cr Watt asked if a telegram in the Advertiser about the railway premises [at Burra] being abominable had been authorised by Council to be sent.

The Mayor replied it was not the wish of Council to report as appeared in the telegram as it was not a true report.

The editor found the latter statement strange as the premises had been in such a state that they warranted a special meeting of the Board [of Health] when a notice was authorised to be served by the Inspector of Nuisances, and at last Mondayâ€™s meeting of the Board it was reported that a notice had been served as the drain was very offensive.

The letter from the Burra Institute Committee refusing to install a urinal and closet for public use in the absence of any legal requirement will be referred to the Central Board of Health.
