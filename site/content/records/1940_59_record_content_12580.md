Burra Town Council, 11 January

The corner of Kangaroo & Commercial St is to be inspected with a view to having a tree in Lane Garden removed to ease the turn for vehicles.

The Municipal Association advises that they believe the attempt of the Institute Committee to raise the rent on the Council Chamber comes under Clause 15 of the Fair Rents Act.

The matter will be discussed after the Annual Meeting of Subscribers to the Institute.
