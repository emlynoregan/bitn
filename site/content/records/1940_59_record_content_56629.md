Mid-North Annual Methodist Synod was held at Kooringa 28 & 29 October.

Pastor H. Hobbs of Kooringa will retire next April and the circuit has asked for a married probationary minister or a married home missioner.  Appreciation was expressed for Rev. Hobbs’ generosity in coming out of retirement to take the position.

On Tuesday night Rev. I. Wardle gave an address on Church work among migrants.  The synod endorsed the retention of 6 o’clock closing for hotels and was opposed to lotteries in SA.

CWA attended to the avenue of trees running west from the Hospital on Wednesday.  They are growing well.
