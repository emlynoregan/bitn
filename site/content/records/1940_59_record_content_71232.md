G. Stanley Hawker MP was able to intercede with the SAR to get much needed corn sacks to Burra to prevent a delay of one week in harvesting.  On 22 December SAR said they could only load for Burra on Monday and Wednesday and as Monday 2 January was a holiday they could not load until Wednesday 4 January to reach Burra on 5 January, creating a weekâ€™s delay.  After contacting the Secretary of the Railways, Mr Hawker was able to get the bags on the cabbage train on Friday 23 December.  [This only makes sense if you realise that the other public holidays in the intervening week would have been Monday 26 December and Wednesday 28 December.]
