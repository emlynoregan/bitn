Inquest into the death of Dugald McNiel [sic] was held at the Court House last Tuesday by W.R. Ridgway JP with M. Rayner as foreman of the jury.

Johnson Carpenter, farmer of Baldina told how he found the body on Monday with the team some 30-40 yards from it.  He said he believed the wheels had passed over the body and saw no other marks of a struggle etc.

P-C Williams said the body was face down some 19’ inside the gate from Mongolata.  The deceased appears to have fallen under the front wheels about 12’ from the gate and been dragged along the ground about 7’ with the left side of the face downwards.  From the markings etc. he believed the deceased came into contact with the gatepost.

D.J. McNeil, [sic] son of the deceased, was working on Booborowie Station and identified the clothes, but could not identify the body due to decomposition.

Verdict was accidental death caused by a wagon loaded with wood passing over the body.
