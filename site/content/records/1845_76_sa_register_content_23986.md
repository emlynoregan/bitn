Wheat Yields 1870-71 Season

The Burra [County] has nearly doubled its wheat area since the harvest of 1869-70 and reports for its 6,345 acres an average yield of 17 bushels 10 lb per acre.  Thousands of acres have yet to be planted in this county, but they are rapidly passing into the hands of farmers.

[60 lb of wheat in 1 bushel.]
