A-Company Cadets (Burra & Terowie) had a field day at Burra on Saturday.  A presentation was made by the Mayor, Dr J.I. Sangster Jnr to Lieutenant A.W. Lott because A-Company came second in the Commonwealth Rifle Match.  He said he hoped Burra would soon have a corps of B.P. Scouts, who were creating such a stir in the world.

He also presented a gold medal to R.H. Tuck of Terowie and a silver one to E. Rule of Burra.

In a rifle match between Burra & Terowie, Burra 429 defeated Terowie 394.
