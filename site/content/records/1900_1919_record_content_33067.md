Sister Mosey.  On Wednesday a crowd gathered at the Hospital to farewell Sister Mosey, who has resigned as Matron of the hospital to further her career in Sydney.  F. Treloar (Secretary of the Hospital Board) was in the chair.  Sister Mosey had been at the hospital in various capacities for 14 years and had been Sister-in-charge for the last 7.  She had come as a patient and stayed on as a probationer, charge nurse and matron.  She was presented with a travelling bag, nurseâ€™s Bible and a gold watch.  [Details occupy c. 1 column.]
