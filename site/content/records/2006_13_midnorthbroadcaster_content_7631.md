N. Manos of Bower writes about the Eudunda Sports Complex, expressing disquiet at the proposal that Eudunda Ward should carry all the liability for costs when the ECBaT appears not to have an independent accountant’s assessment of the figures.  He was also surprised that it was ECBat’s own recommendation that the liability be Eudunda Ward’s alone: so it is not possible to blame either the Council or other wards for that.
