Burra Kindergarten requires $1,700 annually.  The Kindergarten Union receives an annual SA Government grant which is used to maintain the Kindergarten Training College and subsidise salaries at branch kindergartens.  Local kindergartens must fund and maintain buildings and pay the balance of salaries.  Burra Kindergarten receives $850 in voluntary contributions, which almost covers salary costs.  A further $600 is needed to cover running and maintenance costs and $200 is needed to repay the building load.
