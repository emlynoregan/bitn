Redruth Court, 3 October

Clement Arnold Humphrys was charged with ill-treating a slut by inserting a wire in the labia [to prevent the slut from getting pregnant].  Eventually the case was dismissed because the information was laid too late.

C.A. Humphrys was charged with working a mare with sore shoulders.  Fined 10/- + £3-3-0 costs.

James Brereton sued C. Humphrys for trespass of sheep, claiming £20.  Humphrys had a counter-claim of £10 for trespass of horses.  There followed considerable argument about the state of fences etc and finally the plaintiff was awarded £10 and the counterclaimant £5.
