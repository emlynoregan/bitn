Marriage.  At world’s End on Wednesday Annie Pryor, daughter of W.H. Pryor of World’s End, married Cuthbert James, son of N. James of Baldina.  Over 300 sat down to the wedding breakfast at the residence of the bride’s father.  It was also the 55th anniversary of W.H. Pryor’s marriage.  Mr & Mrs Pryor are both a fit 76 years old and both stayed up celebrating till 4 a.m.

[Mr C. Fuss responded to the health of the bride and groom proposed by Rev. S. Kessell.]

The evening passed with songs, music and numerous games, followed (surely unusually for a wedding) by addresses on The Sheep and Farming Industry by Messrs Quinn, Pryor, James and Irlam, before dancing – some of the sets being very well gone through.  [There is a tinkettling performance mentioned, but the sequence of events as reported is not very clear.]
