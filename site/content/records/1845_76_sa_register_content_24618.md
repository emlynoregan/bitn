The Draeger Family gave a concert at Banks’s new assembly room on 19 & 20 June.  Due to poor publicity the audiences were small, but the quality of the singing and instrumental performances should ensure capacity audiences if the family returns with proper notice.

Burra District Council.  Moves to get this body established seem to have died again.  This is a pity as local government would greatly improve the town.  Goats and pigs roam at ease in the streets to the annoyance of those who have formed gardens and the roads are miserable.

The Christies gave a performance on Friday night in the Assembly Room in aid of the Institute.  It passed off well.
