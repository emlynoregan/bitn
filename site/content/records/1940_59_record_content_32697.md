War Memorial Committee Starts Work

Working bees are held on Saturday s and on 2 August all the oval fence posts, seats and goal posts were removed and stored.  There has been a suggestion for tennis courts on the vacant block opposite, which the committee would happily adopt if finance is available.  A plan is being drawn up by Mr F.A. Gunthorpe for the remodelling of Victoria Park.  The SA Treasurer has approved the transfer of the £400 held by the Town Council and the application now awaits the Federal Treasurer’s approval.  The committee appeals for a generous response to their appeal for funds for this War Memorial Project.  A.B. Riggs has given £20 outright and W. Carpenter has raised £40 from Football afternoon teas.  T.H. Villis has donated 100 yards of stone from the old mines for a retaining wall.
