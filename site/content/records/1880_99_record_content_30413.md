North Ward Ratepayers’ Meeting.

This was due for 15 November at the German Chapel in Redruth, but the Mayor forgot to book the room.  The ratepayers who had assembled adjourned to the Court House Hotel where Cr Harris was voted into the chair.

Crs Pinch and Davis [sic, should be Davies] spoke on the past year and generally regretted that so much money had been spent and the debt had to be carried over.  They wished it was otherwise and they had voted against all extravagance.

[The 1½ column report contains little that is new.]

W.T. Rabbich spoke as a candidate for 1889.
