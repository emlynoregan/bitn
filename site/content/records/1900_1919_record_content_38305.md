Accident.  Mr C. Lord had a narrow escape from death on Friday.  He was driving a horse attached to a light trolly in Morehead St when a pair of horses which had bolted from the saleyards collided with the trolly.  Mr Lord was thrown onto the horse he was driving, but slipped as it panicked and, becoming entangled in the reins, he was dragged some distance.  The wheel ran over Mr Lordâ€™s foot and he was badly bruised.
