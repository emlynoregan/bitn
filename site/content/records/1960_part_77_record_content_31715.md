The Burra Methodist Circuit held a local church conference last Sunday at Kooringa Church.  Those attending have declared it a decided success.  The possibility of merging the two Sunday schools from next February was discussed.  Changes to the form of evening service were considered and so was the purchase of a bus to transport adherents and students to the Sunday school.
