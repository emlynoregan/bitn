Burra Town Council, 8 June

Burra electric Supply Co. advises the cost of installing a light at the corner of St Just St would be £12-10-0 and not £22-2-0 as previously advised.  Resolved to go ahead at the revised price.

A meeting has been arranged between Council and the Burra electric Supply Co. for 18 June to discuss the future electricity supply.

R.H. Campbell wrote to say he would be unable to honour his nomination for North Ward Councillor, as he had been transferred to Adelaide.  His resignation was accepted without penalty.

The CWA has donated £5 for the purchase of crockery for the Town Hall.

Council agreed to sponsor a boy in the Advertiser Youth Travel Contingent as previously noted.

The Town Clerk announced the election of W.A. Nankivell as Councillor for North Ward, unopposed.
