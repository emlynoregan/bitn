Sister Mosey was captured in the fall of Hong Kong.  Mrs Sophie Chamberlain of Coomulong, her sister, has now been informed of her fate by Lady Blackburn the wife of a diplomat exchanged for Japanese diplomats.  At first Sister Mosey was left in charge of an emergency hospital for wounded soldiers, but when this was taken over by the Japanese she was imprisoned in reasonably comfortable conditions.
