Weather.  In the past week very hot weather led up to Saturday when at 9 p.m. a very severe thunderstorm struck with severe hail which covered the ground 2”-3” thick.  Vegetation was stripped of leaves and flowers were destroyed.  Grapes were reduced to pulp.  Spoutings were blocked and water overflowed into ceilings.  Scores of sparrows were killed.  Two horses attached to vehicles carrying children bolted, but they ran into each other after 100 yards and so a more serious result was averted.
