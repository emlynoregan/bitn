The Kingston St Bridge is also causing concern.  Cyclists approaching its eastern end from the school are not easily seen by motorists travelling east.  The school’s co-operation will be sought and Cr Baulderstone moved that ‘School’ signs be placed at the approach near the RSL corner to slow traffic to 15 m.p.h. over the bridge.
