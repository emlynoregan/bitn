[He condemns the personal attacks of some previous writers, but spends most of the letter discussing which day of the week is the Sabbath and concludes that Olive Bence can watch sport on Sunday, the first day of the week, without in any way breaking any of God’s commandments.    He also says he does not go to church, but for different reasons from Olive; his reason can be found in Matthew 15-3 and Mark 7-6 to 8: i.e. ‘But he answered and said unto them,  Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?’

‘He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.

Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.

For laying aside the commandments of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.’]
