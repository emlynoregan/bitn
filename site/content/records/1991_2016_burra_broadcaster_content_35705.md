Burra History

[Reprint of an article by Brad Crouch in the Sunday Mail.  It outlines the origins and importance of the town in the nineteenth century and mentions some of the sites of interest to the modern tourist.  The editor adds that we have seen Burra chosen as the site for the filming of Breaker Morant and as the backdrop for [the New Zealand TV show] Miss Popularity 2005 and as the location for the latest Qantas advertisement.

BUT note that Brad Crouch says:

‘The English, Scottish, Welsh, Cornish and Irish miners were not keen to integrate and instead set up separate enclaves, which today make up the town.’

There is no historical basis for this assertion.  Birth and deaths records for the relevant mining period, giving place of births and deaths do not show any such tendency for segregation.  Any tendency to aggregation along lines of origin in different parts of the UK or elsewhere is weak and explicable for other reasons, such as place of employment.  This myth is perpetuated without basis and probably grew from the street and place names rather than from any real evidence.]
