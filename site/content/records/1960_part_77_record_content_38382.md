Mrs Lorna Norris nee Bowen sent in a photo yesterday of the business premises of A.J. Hunt, saddler, now K.J. Murphy’s and before this the shop was owned by Mr Nicholls, the jeweller.  Three men in the photo were the owner, Alfred Hunt, his son Reuben and nephew William Hunt.  William Hunt said it was taken 56 years ago when he was 17 and had completed almost five years of his apprenticeship.  At 73 he still wears a white apron and works with leather.  The shops on either side of Hunt’s then were both owned by C.C. Williams, ironmonger.  (Now the Record office and J. Hill’s.)
