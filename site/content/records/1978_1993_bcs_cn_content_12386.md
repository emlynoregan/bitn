Anonymous writes: Point of View

In calling on the Council to hold a poll or survey of residents on the Market Square question the writer makes the following points:

Dismay at the splitting of the town into factions

Dismay at the attitudes shown at the National Trust meeting of 20 March by various new members

It is time to stop saying ‘I am right’ on an emotional level and to start asking what is best for the town on a logical basis

Council needs to admit it made a grave error of judgement in not recognising fully the heritage value of the square

Concessions made since have only been made under extreme pressure

The National Trust was slow to recognise the threat to the square

The Burra Preservation Committee supposedly has a large following, but is not recognised by Council, perhaps because of its inconsistencies and emotional approach

Council needs to acknowledge it is elected to govern on behalf of the people; not to rule over them

All deserve a say, but should be willing then to abide by the majority decision.
