Burra Town Council.

Letter from the Bishop of Petersburg re a slip of land 66’ by 385’ adjacent to the Kooringa Cemetery.  It belonged to the Roman Catholic Church.  The writer suggested it be properly fenced and then used for Catholic burials under the control of the Council.

The Mayor had pointed out to the Bishop that it would involve a heavy expense.  An estimate of cost to shift the wall is to be obtained.

Letter from Gerald B. Lincoln & J. Kenneth McDougal, consulting electrical engineers of Melbourne, offering to give detailed costs re electric lighting for a fee of 30 guineas — half refundable if the scheme went ahead.

Turner Robertson & Co. were paid £10 for preparing an electric light scheme.  [There was no commitment to them beyond their use as consulting engineers.]

The Commissioner of Crown Lands has postponed gazetting the original lighting scheme at Council request.  The mayor thought that it was time for a decision on it.

Cr Wicklein said the scheme at Jamestown had failed due to an insufficiently powerful engine.

The Mayor didn’t know if that was Turner & Robertson’s fault or not, but only a portion of the town was being lighted.  Kadina had similar problems.

Cr Radford thought the proposal for Burra was inadequate and moved it be rejected.  Cr Walker 2nd.

Cr Lane moved deferral for six months and Cr Parks 2nd.  Amendment carried with Radford and Walker opposed.

5 chains of road from St Joseph’s to the National Bank to be tar-paved as an experiment.

Crs Walker & Radford then wanted 2 chains to be done from Sara & Co.’s towards Tiddy’s.  [Since they thought 5 chains too much for a trial this might seem illogical, but then clearly the north end of town deserved a trial as well!  The result of this motion is not reported.]
