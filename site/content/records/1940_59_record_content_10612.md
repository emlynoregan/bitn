Obituary.  Mr William Terry died on Wednesday last after an illness of some weeks.  He was born at Bimbowrie Station on 15 November 1877 and was the fourth son of the late William and Mary Terry.  The family later lived at Copperhouse where Mr Terry was educated.  After school he worked for the late Mr John Nickles, Mr Tom Rogers and Mr Jim Thomas.  He then went to NSW and worked on Sturt Meadows and Langawirra Stations, after which he worked at the Broken Hill Mines until returning to Burra in 1910.  He was then engaged by Mr I.J. Warnes as overseer at Sturt Vale Station, a position he held for about ten years.  Then for about five years he was employed by Messrs Gallagher Bros. at Quondong.  Soon after Mongolata Mines opened up he worked on the gold mines until his health forced him to give up hard manual work.  Five years ago he became the licensee of the Burra Billiard Saloon, which he held until his death.  He had a quiet unassuming manner.  He married Miss Edith Rose Primer at Broken Hill on 24 April 1899, who survives with three sons: W. George Terry and Mr Jack Terry of Burra and Mr Tom Terry of Whyalla.  There are three grandchildren.

[Born 15 November 1877 Bimborie Station [Bimbowrie?]: died 17 June 1942 Burra.]
