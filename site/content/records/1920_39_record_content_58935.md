Obituary.  Sarah Rose Parks died at her home in Kooringa on 12 December aged 67.  she was the wife of Charles Parks and mother of Harry & Fred (Deceased), Joe of Kooringa and Tom of Semaphore.  [Born Sarah Rose Harris 9 May 1868 Kooringa.]

Mrs Parks died after a long and trying illness.  Her death came as a surprise to many who were unaware of the serious nature of her illness.  She was born in 1868 at Rose Cottage, Kooringa, the third daughter of the late Mr & Mrs Ambrose Harris, pioneer residents of Burra and District.  Prior to her marriage she was a valued member of the Kooringa Methodist Church Choir and with her three sisters, assisted in all musical matters in the town.  Throughout her married life she maintained her music and always derived much pleasure from playing the organ.  When her family grew up Mrs Parks assisted her husband in the business and was highly esteemed by customers for her kindly, bright manner and benevolent spirit.  When his health forced Mr Parks to retire they lived quietly at Darton Cottage.  Her health has been causing Mr Parks grave anxiety for some months.  Mrs Parks had been a member of the Rechabite Lodge for fifty years.  As well as her husband she is survived by two sons: Joseph Parks of Kooringa and Tom Parks of Semaphore.  Her eldest son, Harry, died in September last and her youngest, Fred, just over two years ago.  Three sisters survive: Mrs J.A. Watt of Payneham, Mrs R.H. Steele of Glenelg and Mrs J.E. Greenwood of Adelaide.

There are several grandchildren and one great-grandson.
