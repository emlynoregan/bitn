Fatal Accident at Booborowie.  Miss Eileen Flynn, a visitor to the district, went riding on Saturday 17 December and was thrown from her horse.  She was found on the road by Gerald Andrew Wade.  Evidence at the inquest was that the horse was regarded as perfectly safe and had been in the family for about 17 years.  Dr Steele said death was due to a fracture at the base of the skull.  There were signs the horse had put its foot in a hole.  The verdict was of accidental death.
