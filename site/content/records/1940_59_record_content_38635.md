Burra Town Council, 6 September

The Town Clerk reported that shortage of materials made it impossible to get quotes for the making of bicycle racks.

It was resolved to get local prices for racks, with the Council supplying second-hand piping.

There were complaints that library users had difficulty entering the Town Hall on picture nights owing to picture patrons blocking the entrance.  The picture proprietor is to be asked to see that both doors are open.

Cricket clubs were granted permission to practise on Victoria Park for the season.

Council will co-operate with the District Council in setting up a committee to consider organising a suitable landing area for aircraft in distress.  Mr L. Thomas had a paddock, which he would probably lend for the purpose and a few people with cars needed to be organised to floodlight the ground in an emergency.

Burra Cold Stores were given permission to remove old smokehouses and replace them with a storeroom.

Main Road grant for 1948-49 is to be £300 with Council’s contribution set at £100.

The Railways Commissioner will be asked to rectify the problem caused by trains stopping for up to three quarters of an hour across the Bon Accord crossing.
