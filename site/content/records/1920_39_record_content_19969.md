Burra Town Council, 21 June

The Fire Brigades Board returned £1-10-0 overpayment for last year’s expenses.

Arrangements have been made with Mr Ford to use his quarry whenever necessary.  [Aberdeen Ballast Quarry.]

The Bon Accord Bridge needs attention.

The deputation to the Minister of Local Government for a Special Main Roads grant was favourably received and they are hopeful of a favourable response.

The effigy of the miner (Johnnie Green) has vanished.  Cr Riggs said he had asked Fred Pascoe where it was and told him that Mr McBride had given it to the Council, but Mr Pascoe seemed unwilling to give information.  Mr Pascoe is to be written to.

Cr Riggs’ proposal for the guns is to be submitted to the RSA.

Cr Kellaway said that safety suggested the fence run to a ‘bull-nose’ rather than be a rectangle.
