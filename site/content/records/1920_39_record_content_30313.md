N. Hiles Pearse replies to his critics in a long letter extending for over 1½ columns.

In response to ‘Citizen’ & ‘A Methodist’ he defines a wowser in several ways – basically as a hypocrite: ‘A man who, though as full of original sin as his neighbour yet affects to despise that neighbour whilst descending to the same transgressions by stealth.’

He does not think wowsers are confined to Methodism, but are ‘self-sufficient’.

Perhaps with his tongue a little in his cheek he writes: ‘I have always found Methodists a quiet unassuming crowd, clannish perhaps, and lacking that modicum of dare-devil element necessary for the accomplishment of doughty deeds of dareing do [sic] (referring not to their war records, but to civil life) doing quite a lot of good according to their lights and rather circumscribed outlook.’

He says he has helped the Catholic sports in Morgan for years, but the first he knew of the picnic races was in Mr Canny’s letter to the editor.  He has been a judge at meetings at Robertstown, Manoora and Eudunda as well as at Burra and of motor cycle events locally too.  He has also contributed to dog trials, shows, racing clubs, tennis, football and cricket clubs as well as the Salvation Army and all church fetes.

Rev. Harris’s letter he regarded as fair and measured, though a suggestion that it is perhaps unbecoming to patronise races at the present time might reflect disloyalty on H.M. the King.

He goes on to compare money raising for local causes in the poor and small centre of Morgan with Burra – to Burra’s considerable disadvantage.  He accuses Burra of lacking unity and co-operation and of being afflicted by cliques.  All he was asking for was some co-operation.

Mr Sara he berates for clerical errors, want of style and inaccuracies.  He says to Mr Sara: ‘we must not always think in terms of money; that is too sordid’.

He admits he may not attend all the small events, but he does give financial support and after all he has a 60 mile journey each time he attends.

[His letter is a fine example of a good humoured response written in good, easily read plain English.]
