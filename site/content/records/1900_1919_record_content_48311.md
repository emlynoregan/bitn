Rev. W.F. James has published a book on the history of the Bible Christian Church in Australia and the world.  It includes a history of the Bible Christian Church in Burra and illustrations of the original Bible Christian Church and manse and also the newer one now in ruins as well as pictures of a number of the ministers well known here, like Rev. James Way and Rev. Joseph Hancock.  There is reference too to the great revival when 400 attended weeknight services and 390 converts, including 70 juveniles, were made.  Sunday school under Thomas Richard contained over 500 scholars.  The church cost £2,217 and seated 600.  Proceeds of the sales will aid Adelaide Central Mission and Dr Torr’s Training Home at Brighton.
