Mid-North Agricultural Bureau Conference

Mr Oram, Member of the Advisory Board, gave the address.  In England importers used to mix Australian wheat with other wheat to improve its milling quality.  At times now the reverse is done.

Dr Callaghan said:

1865-90 SA grew half the wheat grown in Australia and now this has fallen to 16%.

1930-31 4.5 million acres were planted and last season 1.5 million acres were sown to wheat.

1860-90 the yield was 10 b per acre

1890-1900 the yield was 5 b per acre

1900-40 the yield was 10 b per acre with superphosphate

1940-50 the yield was 21 b per acre

1953 the yield was 22 b per acre

SA needs 8 million bushels for its home consumption.  The SA Government would like to see 2.25 million acres of wheat, 900,000 acres of barley and 550,000 acres of oats sown in SA annually.  They hope to achieve this by 1957-58.  Barley is in demand for Japan, where it is used as an alternative to rice.

Dennis Muirhead gave advice on feeding sheep.

Lambing ewes should be hand fed in the lean months March to May.  Drought stricken sheep do better on one good feed a week rather than a little daily.  There was discussion on sheep dipping before mating and after shearing.

Mr Herriot spoke on soil conservation.
