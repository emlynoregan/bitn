Barry & Jill Read have established their land on the southeast side of Burra as a conservation sanctuary.  It is also protected as Department of Environment & Heritage by an agreement prohibiting the grazing of cattle and sheep in perpetuity.  Their study of the property has revealed 56 indigenous species of flora and fauna.
