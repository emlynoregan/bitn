H.J. Button responds to ‘Ajax’ on Council Assessments, but it adds little to the debate besides pointing out that a number of Ajax’s points are merely assertions and the Advertiser has run a campaign recently to show how land and securities had decreased in value in contrast to Ajax’s view that ‘Therefore the move to lower assessments that were never too high is a mild form of panic which is not justified.’
