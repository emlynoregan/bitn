Last week Jack Pederson (7’1” on a penny farthing bike) rode in a private trial race against Nigel Thorpe (the 3ft nothing bank boy on a boy’s bike) last week.  Jack drove Shorty into the bank on the turn where he lost all interest in the proceedings and Jack won by a long neck.  After the race Nigel claimed Jack was tacking too much and had the hide to claim a win over a (glace) kid.
