Burra Copper Festival.  The committee met on 23 October to discuss the next Festival.  The weekend was a great success and proceeds will total $2,500.  This will be placed in the hands of the Burra District Tourist Promotion Committee, which no doubt will seek subsidies to supplement the usefulness of the money.
