The Civic Reception for the Governor is reported in just over 1 column.

The Laying of the Soldiers’ Memorial Foundation Stone is reported in 2 columns.

Returned soldiers formed a guard of honour.  Susie Hill presented a bouquet to Lady Weigall.  Miss Dorothy Brown presented a bouquet to Miss Priscilla Weigall.  The Mayor welcomed the party and presented the Governor with a silver trowel mounted in gold and made in Burra by Mr F. Spencer, himself a returned soldier.  He also made the malachite brooch presented to Lady Weigall.

The Governor then laid the stone and buried an earthenware jar containing a copy of the daily papers and the Burra Record for the day and also one of the Records that contained a list of names of Burra volunteers, the current coins of the realm up to a florin and a document about the war effort in the district.  His Excellency then spoke followed by a few words from Lady Weigall, W.G. Hawkes and Dr Steele.

The Mayor read apologies for absence of Major General Antill, Brigadier General Leane, Hon. J. Lewis and Messrs I.J. Warnes, Thomas Drew and T.H. Pearse.  One of the guns promised for the memorial had, he said, been shipped from Melbourne.

The Mayor then reviewed the wonderful days of the war effort in Burra and called for donations that were required for both the memorial and the roll of honour.  Donations of £878-1-9 were acknowledged.
