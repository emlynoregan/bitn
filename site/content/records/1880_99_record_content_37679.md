The Grand Entertainment for the VF and the Burra Literary Society was well-arranged and nicely carried out last Friday evening.  There was a large audience and they did well considering the inconvenience of having to provide their own furniture: ‘the provisions made . . . in hall accommodation are disgraceful’. 

The first half was a series of music and songs.  The second part concluded with the screamingly funny ‘Should this meet the Heye’.  [Or as the Record says the ‘screeming comedy’.]  In which the parts were taken by:

Lambkin (An Oil Merchant)	J.A. Watt

Lionel Long (Maud’s Affianced)	W.H. Morton

Septimus Skinflint (Maud’s Guardian)	C. Fuss

Teddy O’Flannigan (Waiter)	N. Opie

Nabbem Grabbem (Bailiff)	?

Maud (Heroine)	Miss Drake

Polly (Chamber Maid)	Miss Bruce
