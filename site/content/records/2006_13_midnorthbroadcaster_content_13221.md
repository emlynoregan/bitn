William Plain writes re the storage shed on Mt Pleasant.  He outlines the tourism facts that Burra receives about 50,000 tourists a year and many are attracted by authentic heritage.  The visitors spend about $7 million annually.  Many businesses and activities benefit from the tourist dollar.  Tourism keeps the town alive.  A large industrial shed looking down over the main street is definitely not heritage.  Degradation of the townâ€™s authentic heritage will ultimately affect your back pocket.  Burra is attempting to establish an Industrial Zone and the shed would be ideally suited to such a zone.

The Chemmart 2012Calender School Art Project has been judged and Alice Tiver (5) is one of the winners.  Alice received a certificate and a $1,000 cheque for her school.
