Postal Deliveries in Burra will be made easier by the allocation of street numbering, which will also benefit visitors to the town.  East and West Wards have been completed and North Ward will follow soon.

Numbering began from the creek for streets running east-west.  Other streets are numbered from the Main Street, Commercial Street and Kingston Street.  Corner blocks were allocated the number of the main street.  Where there are houses on only one side (as in Bridge Terrace) numbers are consecutive.

Page 4 carries the addresses for each person in East and West Wards.
