Leighton Hall was reopened on 29 September.  On the platform were the President I.J. Warnes, Secretary A.T. McWaters & Messrs McDonald & S. Pearce.

The changes include the subdivision of the supper-room into a ladies’ and gents’ cloak room and a committee or smoke room.  The platform was improved and the hall repainted and lined with a large louvre roof overall.  Mrs Warnes had presented curtains costing some £25 and Mr Warnes had given the sum of £250 towards the renovations.  Mr Warnes was given a key to perform the re-opening.  He said that 15 or 16 years ago the hall had been built at a cost of £250, but was then only ⅔ the size.  The contractors had been (for the renovations) Pearce and Woollacott.  Mr Murison’s Jazz Band then provided music for a dance followed by supper.
