Ladies Political Social.  Burra Institute 26 November.

W.G. Hawkes presided and the speakers were Mr Hawker, Hon. T. Pascoe and Miss Farr.

[They were a conservative group who spoke in favour of the current role of the Legislative Council and against any reform of it, or its abolition, which was Labor Party policy.  Apparently it was organised by the National Defence League.]

We understand that as a result of the meeting a large number of ladies as well as gentlemen joined the league.
