Election Speeches at Burra

Monday Night: Mr Stanley Hawker LCL

Primary products provide 69% of SA’s exports and the other chief export is the concentrate from Broken Hill, exported through Port Pirie.  SA primary production had greatly increased with improved pasture and higher yielding cereals and improved land fertility.  For Burra a sealed road from Adelaide was in sight and ETSA power was coming.  Details of the duplication of the Morgan-Whyalla pipeline were now being worked out and included a branch line to Burra.  Burra School had been improved and a new Nurses’ Quarters at the Burra Hospital had been subsidised.  Burra was an important centre with a good rail service and an excellent climate.

Hon. Sir Lyell McEwin said the Playford Government had carried out practical decentralisation and the Northern Areas were benefiting from the Morgan-Whyalla pipeline and Leigh Creek coal developments.  Mineral resources were being developed, such as uranium, pyrites and barytes.

Mr P.H. Quirke, Independent, will speak tonight and will mention his disappointment that sixteen seats in the House of Assembly are not being contested and there is only one contest in the Legislative Council.  That 165,000 electors on 3 March will not have a vote is a fantastic wrong and it owes its origin to the electoral system.  Only Independents can cause a vote to be taken in the circumstances.  The vote is the first loss under totalitarian rule.  A powerful opposition is vital for Parliament and its power is best used to improve legislation through criticism and not just to oppose because a proposal comes from the other side – something both parties are guilty of.  The presence of Independents in the SA Parliament has been important in championing the rights of electors.  Having represented Clare, Saddleworth, Riverton and Hamley Bridge areas for fifteen years, he felt that the Burra, Jamestown and Spalding areas had no markedly different needs.  He promised in return for their votes to give close attention to matters affecting individual electors and to give care and attention to his Parliamentary duties.
