Article on Mulesing Sheep

Mulesing is the removal of strips of wrinkly wool-bearing skin from around the backside (breech) and tail of sheep.  It has been a common practice as a way to reduce the incidence of fly-strike on Merino sheep.

A US-based animal rights organisation, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has campaigned against it as cruel and inhumane.

The campaign threatened the livelihood of wool producers and the entire wool industry in Australia.

The Australian Wool & Sheep Industry Task Force has decided to phase out the practice by 2010.

Information sessions in the area have been well attended.

One alternative being used is fly-strike chips.  These are attached to the skin normally removed by mulesing and restrict the blood flow.  This causes the skin to wither.  It and the biodegradable chips then fall off in a couple of weeks.

[The process is named after J.H.W. Mules an Australian farmer who died in 1946.  A report in the Burra Record on its performance in 1943 at Mt Bryan rather suggests it was relatively new at that time.  Another in 1970 suggests its popularity grew rapidly in the late 1960s.]
