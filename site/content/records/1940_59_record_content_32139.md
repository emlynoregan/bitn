Burra Community Sports Centre

The idea of a Community Sports Centre at the racecourse is growing in popularity.  It will be discussed at a ratepayers’ meeting on 14 July.  A.B. Riggs has offered £20 if nine others will match it and if the Town Council become trustees of the land.  He calls for more action and less talk.  If a club or other body is not owner of the land they will not be able to obtain a bank overdraft on it.  This may seem to be a disadvantage for the organisation, but on the whole is probably good for the club, too many of which get into trouble handling debts.

Burra has over £1,000 in public funds which could, with some effort, be freed for this project.  Probably a full-time curator would be needed.  A line of almond trees right along the road would provide a source of income as well as being beautiful when in blossom.  Membership fees of say £1-1-0, similar to Adelaide Cricket Club would be another source of income.

There will be an opportunity on 14 July to thrash this matter out and to get things going.

First Trustees of the Burra Sports Association – William Pitt Barker, James Henry Gallagher, Ludwig Wilhelm Gebhardt, John Tennant, John Lewis and Thomas Sandland.

The object of the Sports Syndicate was to provide the people of the town and district with the opportunity and means of physical recreation, outdoor sports, including racing, amusement and entertainment, educational and other exhibitions and gatherings of public meetings for general welfare and to promote and encourage all such ends and purposes and for such other purposes as the Trustees may deem advisiable.
