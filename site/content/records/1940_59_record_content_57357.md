Burra War Memorial Park.  A few years ago a Burra War Memorial Committee was formed to transform Victoria Park.  Working bees were held, some money collected and some ratepayers’ funds were added.  Despite rather half-hearted support from the public, the oval was graded and enlarged.  Other improvements were made and the oval was planted with grass.  The big blow has been the discovery that the water pressure available is insufficient to work the sprinklers and the Water Supply Department, apparently seeing little likelihood of revenue, refused to go about increasing the pressure to any extent.  As a result the ground remained idle for a year or two, waiting for rain to make the grass grow.    The grass did grow and for last winter it looked good, but with summer no couch came on to maintain the ‘green sward’ through summer and large bare patches have emerged.  Cricketers are complaining and footballers wondering what will be done, but how many of those who get enjoyment from the oval appear on working bees?  It would be possible to turn the water on, but the problem is getting someone to move the sprinklers during the day and until that problem is solved the Burra War Memorial Oval is not going to flourish and the War Memorial Project will fail.
