Iron Mine & Leighton Athletic Club held a sports meeting at Mr Holmes’s ground near Iron Mine Primitive Methodist Chapel on Wednesday.  At least 300 attended.  Apart from the usual foot and bicycle events there was a series of races for children from the age of 5.  The day proved quite profitable.  Results of the adult races are printed.
