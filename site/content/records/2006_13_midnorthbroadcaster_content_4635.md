Paxton Square

The committee considering the square’s future is making slow progress following the public meeting in November, which attracted much interest.  The plans for the future of the cottages have been evoked by the expiration of the Heritage Facility Agreement held by Maswood Pty Ltd, which occurs on 31 August 2008.  Council says the income raised is continually in deficit of the costs of desperately needed renovations and upkeep.  The Mayor says occupancy rates are sliding and revenues are not increasing.  The committee reports that it needs access to current accurate information on operating costs, but privacy of the business dealing of the current managers’ operations makes this impossible.

The Council rent is minimal, but would require around 10% minimal occupancy.

Several possibilities are being considered, including a long term lease.

The committee has raised several concerns regarding the need for accurate information, especially the need to gain access to actual operating costs of maintaining the cottages.  But the manager of properties and facilities Mike Fretwell suggested an educated guess would have to suffice as access to all costs were part of the private business dealings of the current manager’s operations.

Another option was to let four or five of the cottages on a permanent basis to the Burra based diving school as regular accommodation for their students.  Occupancy of the cottages has been minimal even in months deemed popular by tourists.

The committee has been granted an extension of time to the end of April to make its recommendations.  The delay has been due to the need to examine the primarily confidential Heritage Facility Agreement.  This was undertaken last Thursday.  They will next meet on 19 February and may then need to meet fortnightly to meet the deadline.
