C. & T. Tiver has a lucky escape at the Bon Accord crossing.  They were in a spring cart with two little boys and were just crossing the line when several trucks were sent down the track to the ballast quarry.  The trucks struck and smashed the cart and threw the occupants out.  The horse leapt clear and no one was injured.  The crossing remains unprotected.
