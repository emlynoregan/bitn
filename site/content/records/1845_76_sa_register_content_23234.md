Booborowie Mine.  Captain Collins has passed through Burra en route to re-open the Booborowie Mine.  The proprietors are fortunate in obtaining their claim, as the North Burra Co. made a mistake as to their boundary and has sunk several shafts and raised some good ore on the Booborowie section under the impression it belonged to them.
