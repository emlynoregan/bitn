Letter.  Garry Edwards writes, annoyed that Channel 10, which promised to be operating through Southern Cross 10 Pt Pirie, has continually thought up excuses as to why that channel is not operating.  Some residents subscribe to Austar or to the Imparja satellite system, but neither is really satisfactory if you want live sports coverage.
