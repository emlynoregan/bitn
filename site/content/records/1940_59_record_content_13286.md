Burra Town Council & the Institute Committee have finally reached agreement on Council’s lease of the Council Chamber.  Council has been paying £36 for a number of years and the committee thought this too low and asked for £65 for sole use with Council to clean.  The Council has now agreed to pay the £65, but the committee will supply the cleaner, fuel and light and three nights’ use of the hall free of charge.  The Council will also be represented on the Institute Committee.
