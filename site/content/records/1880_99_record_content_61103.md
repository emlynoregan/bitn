Burra Town Council.

North Ward ratepayers petitioned to be allowed to run cattle on Corporation roads except the main street.  It was resolved not to prosecute for this except for the main roads and Young St.

It will also be allowed in East and West Wards except in East Ward for main roads and Thames St to Stock St and in West Ward for Chapel St to Bath St and Kangaroo St to Queen St.

[This last exception doesn’t make sense, as the two named streets do not intersect.  What might have been intended was Kangaroo & Queen Streets to Bath St.  Though it does not say so, this relaxation of the by-law was probably a temporary concession to the bad season.]

Council leased Best Place Reserve to W.G. Neville for 30/- p.a. to be used for horses only.

Other routine business was dealt with.
