Gary Disher, eldest son of Rob & Lettie Disher of Booborowie had his first book launched on 13 August at a history conference at Monash University in Melbourne.  Commissioned by Oxford University Press, it is Wretches and Rebels; a social history of Australian bushranging.  His second book, a collection of short stories, will be published later this year.

Gary attended Burra High School, matriculated from Adelaide Boys’ High School and then gained a BA from the University of Adelaide and an MA in Australian History from Monash.  In 1982 he will be writing a novel aided by a grant from the Literature Board.
