Burra Town Council

The tender of C.A. Lott to re-roof the depot for Â£29-17-6 was accepted.

E.J. Davey is to be paid 30/- for the time he acted as Town Clerk.

[It is not clear how this fits with the earlier statement that A. Bartholomaeus would be acting Town Clerk.]

The Mayor was asked to interview the postmaster, Mr Rundle about a telephone link to Adelaide.
