Accident.  Mr & Mrs Bruce were driving home to World’s End on Friday night with their young grandson when their horse took fright when a bolt fell out of the shaft onto its heels.  The boy escaped over the back, but Mr & Mrs Bruce were thrown out and badly bruised.  Mr Bruce needed stitches to a scalp wound.  As he is over 70 he is recovering in hospital.  Pte Albert Bruce’s departure for the front was delayed by the accident.
