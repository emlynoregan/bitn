Burra Swimming Pool

The Town Council is concerned that several items connected with the filtration plant have not been completed.  The filtration plant began operation on 22 December 1963, but negotiations with the contractor continued to May 1964 with no result.  Then the Council still did not know why the whole thing had not been finalised.  The Club advised the Council that it owed the contractor £496 or 10% of the initial cost.  This meant the Club could not claim £900 of subsidy from the Tourist Bureau because things were not up to scratch and the E & WS would not give a certificate of satisfaction.  Despite repeated visits and specific requests nothing was done and at the December Council meeting it was decided to give until 21 January to have work commenced.  On 18 January a Council meeting resolved to tell the contractor that if work was not completed within 14 days they would have the job completed and debit the cost to him.  This follows legal advice through the Municipal Association.  It should be noted that the problem is not with the actual filtration process, which is quite normal, but refers to ancillary work like cement work, pipe diameter etc.
