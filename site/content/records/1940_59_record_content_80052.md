Burra Town Council – Town Hall

Fred M. Pearce & Sons tender of £825 for painting the Town Hall was accepted and work will begin soon, to be ready for the opening of the Cinemascope Pictures on Saturday 22 February.  The new seating for the dress-circle will also be installed for this occasion.  Exterior work is due to be done by 18 March.  The painting tender includes the exterior of the Town Clerk’s residence.  The Hall ceiling is to be sapphire blue and dove grey.  Doors will be dove grey and the balcony ceiling will be white.  The proscenium will be samba blue and dove grey with white woodwork.  The Foyer colours will be canyon rose, dove grey and regal blue.  The colours in the Council Chamber will be lavender mist, dove grey and Camden green.

Work on the new supper room and kitchen began yesterday.
