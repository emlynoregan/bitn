SA Premier Visits Burra

In a whirlwind two day visit to the Mid North last week, Premier Jay Weatherill visited Burra and spent time with members of local government, business owners and residents.  He had an informal dinner with community members at the Burra Pizzeria, La Pecora Nera.  On his way back from Peterborough on Thursday, he dropped in at the Burra Railway Station.  In 2009 Mr Weatherill as Environment & Conservation Minister announced the setting aside of $200,000 to kick-start the station restoration project.  Almost five years on, the project has seen the station transformed, with most of the credit going to volunteer Roy Taplin, assisted by local tradesmen.  Roy has been at work each day from 7.30 a.m. to 11 a.m.  The Premier has been following the progress and last year paid a visit to the station, following his nomination of Roy in the Premier’s Heritage Heroes 2015 Award.  He said Roy’s effort had effected an amazing transformation, which was a wonderful credit to Roy and also to all those involved in the restoration.  [3 photos.]
