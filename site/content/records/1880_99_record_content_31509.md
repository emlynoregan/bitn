He accuses Holder of saying:

National debts are honourable

So long as we can pay the interest and the assets cover the liabilities let posterity take care of itself

If we are as well off as other nations with great prestige be content

The brilliance of English intellect could not lead you astray so follow her

Let the tax-paying fools grin and bear it

Holder replies that all he was seeking to do was to show among other things the excellence of the security we offer.

W.T. Rabbich writs at length [⅔ column] taking issue with Dungey’s assertions that men’s industrial efforts have been universally restricted.  He considers that all things considered the colony is in a flourishing state and has achieved great things.  He argues the common sense of borrowing leading to development of a stronger economy.
