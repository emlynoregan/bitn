Burra Hospital Board

The hospital roof is to be painted in the near future.

Lack of trained staff and of girl trainees continues to be a problem.

A public meeting is called for Wednesday to present proposals for improvements to the present buildings and the provision of adequate Nurses’ Quarters.

Burra Pre-School Kindergarten will open on 12 February, not 15 February as previously stated.

Sufficient equipment has been bought to commence.  Subscription list stands at £25-8-0.
