Burra Town Council, 7 June

An enlarged photograph of the Mayor was accepted.

Fire Brigade Board sent a refund of £10-16-4 for 1926.

Permission was granted to an application to remove trees from in front of their businesses from the following (at their own expense): Pederson & Son, E.J. Harris, W.H. Spier, G.C. Kuchenmeister and Walker & Son.

A silent cop is to be placed at the corner of Bence’s Cash and Carry.

[This seems to suggest Bence’s were at this time in the former SA Farmer’s Union building.  According to an advertisement on 6 April Bence’s had bought all SAFU’s stock of drapery and hardware.]

Board of Health

O.G. Walker’s tender for the old lavatories [near the Fire Station] was accepted.

Price of £43-10-0 each was accepted for three new lavatories from N. Woollacott & F.M. Pearce.

Booborowie Bachelors’ Dance was held on 9 June at the Memorial Institute and is reported in 1½ columns.

Burra Coursing Club had its annual meet last week for prize money amounting to £222.  This was the best open coursing stake in SA for many years.  It was run on Hon. Walter Duncan’s Gum Creek Estate.  The report of the meet and the subsequent banquet at the Burra Hotel runs for over 3 columns.  The winner was Just Bell of Mr T. Scovell of Saddleworth.
