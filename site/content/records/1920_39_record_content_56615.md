Mongolata North Area.  [Maps from the Department of Mines show that claims farther north than those mentioned here as the extreme north end, were worked in previous years.]

Reynolds and two men are extending a tunnel close to Terry’s boundary.  Results so far are disappointing.

Mr Feltus, at the extreme northern end of the field, has exposed a ferruginous quartz formation about 14 inches wide, by open cut.  A parcel from this is at the Battery for treatment.

Mr Fayre has abandoned his most northerly working and made an open cut on a small vein adjoining Mr Feltus on the north side of the hill.

Rosewall’s Show, nearby, has a small vein that has been followed into the hill about 40 ft in low values.

Evans & Shipway are working two parallel quartz formations by drive and open cut and have been said to obtain values in panning.
