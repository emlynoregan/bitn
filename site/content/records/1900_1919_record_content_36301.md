Mayor’s Report.

The season promises to be the best for some time and both farmers and pastoralists will have had a good year.  This prosperity augurs well for the town.  Since the last report we have lost Philip Lane, our first Mayor and we have named one of our garden plots Lane Garden as a fitting, though insufficient, recognition.

We were able to buy the Burra Creek south of the [Kingston St] Bridge and through the influence and good services of Hon. J. Lewis MLC about 35 acres north of it to the rear of the Mill, including the plantation, or Jubilee Avenue.

The visit of the American boys was a pleasant interlude from which an invalid chair was bought for the hospital and a donation sent to Minda Home.

Electric lighting has progressed as far as permission being given for its establishment and power to raise money for it.  The next step is the consent of the Commissioner of crown Lands, who has been applied to, but no reply has yet been received.  If the answer is yes, then I suggest we hasten slowly, drawing on the experience of others.

The ornamental gardens, at first scoffed at by some, have since met with universal approval.

The seaside trip for children was an unqualified success and though not actually a municipal matter, it was started by the Council.

The increased lighting of the school owes much to the School Board, whose members are mostly members of Council and the Council fought successfully to retain the stopping of the Broken Hill express at Burra.  The hospital is vested in the Council and a renovation is now in hand.

The general account is currently c. £47 in credit, though it will be in debit c. £20 by the year’s end.

The gong at the Bon Accord crossing has been established.

The Burra Coronation Band continues successfully.

Though details are not finalised, the Hon. J. Lewis MLC has bought Paxton Square and handed it over to Council as housing for the poor.  Letting etc. is to be controlled by the Mayor of the day, a nominee of Mr Lewis and the ministers of the town.  [Anglican, Methodist and Catholic.]  Income is to be used in renovation without profit.

Cr Lowe retires after many terms service with my thanks for his years of attention to North Ward interests.  [He served December 1907 to November 1913.]

The adoption of the report was moved by E. Crewes and 2nd Mr Fuss.

The candidates for office then took the platform.

Mr McLaren thought he had covered most of the issues in his report.  The problem of Burra was that it was spread over 3,000 acres or 5 square miles and fell into two distinct parts, which made some think there was antagonism between the two parts.  Indications that the central authorities wanted to take over main roads would be unfortunate, as the Council got more value for money.  Cars were becoming a problem and their licence fees did not come to Council.  If the electric light were a success he would see it extended to North Ward.  As soon as possible he would like to see it extended as far as Fuss’s shop and Jubilee Hall, after which further extension would have to be guaranteed.  But before establishing it at all more information was needed.  He doubted the usefulness of a Municipal Court.

Mr Crewes said he had not intended to stand for Mayor a week ago, but had been approached by several influential men to do so and had consented.  His previous service had been in the strenuous times of Federation and the Boer War.  The big question now was the electric light.  He had doubts about the so-called expert advice they had received.  Imagine placing the running of the machinery in the hands of an apprentice at £72 p.a.!  At Kadina the engineer got £275 p.a.  This alone made him question the expert’s figures.  The size of the plant was also questionable.  Kadina was already seeking one three times the size of the one it had.  If it could not extend to three wards it should be turned down altogether.  He rather favoured a Municipal Court.

Cr Wicklein liked the garden plots and thought the Council had done good work in 1913 and was glad they had got the Bon Accord gong.  He was for tar paving now that they had 50 barrels of tar.  He favoured a new post office at Aberdeen.

Cr Lane had little to say except that he would do his best.

Mr E.J. Moore is not reported as having done more than announce his candidacy.

Jacob Richards was against lighting only part of the town and would not support the present proposal.  A better one was needed.

Mr Radford said little, but agreed they needed more information before going on with an electricity scheme.

Mr W.H. Hardy thought administrative expenses were too high.  More money needed to be spent in the back streets.  An alteration was needed on the plate of the rotunda to give credit where credit was due.  He favoured fencing the Avenue and a new rubbish depot was needed.

Leighton Strawberry Fete is reported in ¾ column.  Nett proceeds will be c. £60.  Much of the interest was in the failure of Robertson’s lorry on the way home to Burra, which stranded about 50 and resulted in a variety of ways of getting home.
