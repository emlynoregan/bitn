The mayor said there was nothing before the chair.

Cr Button said he took it that the Chief Secretary’s letter denied him a seat on the Hospital Board and he moved the Clerk write for confirmation of the letter.

The Mayor said it was a pure technicality and there was nothing in it.

Cr Button said it all started when the Mayor began splitting straws by refusing to allow discussion of grass burning in the creek at a Board of Health meeting:  ‘I have simply followed your example.’
