The Second Heat Wave for the year has played havoc with stock, poultry and fruit gardens.  Figs, plums and other stone fruit have been scorched and fallen.  Many birds have died.  In town the temperature ranged from 98°f to 112°F and for three days averaged 102°F.  Thunderstorms and a very little rain on Saturday afternoon brought some relief.
