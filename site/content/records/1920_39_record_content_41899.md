Obituary.  Thomas Sandland died in Perth 10 May.  He was the third son of John Chesters Sandland of Lyndoch SA who arrived from Shropshire England in 1847.  He was born at Rowland’s Flat and afterwards lived at Lyndoch.  He was educated at St Peter’s College and then took up farming with his parents.  After some years he went to the Darling River employed by Barritt Wreford and became overseer at Caspa Cora Back Station for four years.  After leaving Moorara he joined his brother J.C. Sandland & Hamilton & Wilcox in Koonamore Station as manager for some years until he married, when he took up property at Mannanarie for about four years.  He then worked for Bennett & Fisher for some years.  The partnership with his brother John & Hamilton & Wilcox was dissolved and he bought the ‘Mule Camp’ property later called Koo-owie from Duffield & Makin with his brother.  When he took over from his brother he renamed it Koo-owie.  At the same time he conducted the auctioneering business of Dempsey, Wilkinson & Sandland at Burra & Jamestown.  His sheep stud at Koo-owie was successful for many years.  In 1902 he took up the Balah lease and in 1908 added the Burra-bidgy Estate at Moora WA stocking it with sheep from Koo-owie and Balah.  He divided his properties among his sons in 1919 retaining half the WA property now known as Wandena where he remained until his death.  In 1924 he visited England and his parents’ home Loppington Hall at Wen in Shropshire where he found a Thomas Sandland in the parish church register in 1602.  In Burra he was a member of the Hospital Board for 21 years and chairman of it as well.  He was a trustee of St Mary’s, a member of the Apoinga Council, President of the Burra Show Society and a Vice-President of the Adelaide Show.  He was a prime mover in starting with six others the Burra Sports Syndicate grounds.  In 1881 he married Ellen Mary Barritt third daughter of Joseph Barritt of Lyndoch.  Five children survive: P.T. Sandland of Moora WA, W.H. Sandland of Kooringa, K.C. Sandland of Kooringa, Mrs T.B. Ashton of Kingswood & Miss E. Sandland of Melbourne.  He was buried in Kooringa Cemetery yesterday.
