Mongolata Gold Field

Byles’ Mongolata GM closed on Friday when all hands were paid off.  This is believed to be a temporary measure, pending alterations to working conditions following the alleged theft of gold from the strong room.

Byles’ Mongolata GM for the fortnight to 28 June

50 ft level: the stope 12 ft below this has holed through to winze and worked out with values 12 dwt per ton.  The drive south showing only traces has been suspended.

90 ft level: the drive south has been extended 36 ft to 448 ft with no values.  The drive off the western tunnel has been extended to 113 ft.

Golden Harp: the winze west of the old workings has been sunk to 14 ft underlie with a small seam, values about 4 dwt.

A crushing of about 200 tons began on 24 June.  On 28 June all work was suspended and all men paid off.  It is hoped to re-open 8 July.

Curlew Syndicate has received a cheque for £816 from the Melbourne Mint for gold smelted at Mongolata.
