Chris McCabe, the first BCS Principal, writes to say that he remembers reading that ‘a town without a newspaper is a town without a soul’.  Ian Auhl said much the same thing in 1976 just before the Burra Record ceased publication in the following year.  He says that the fact that the newsletter survived until December 1993 showed it served a need.  He writes of fond memories of the volunteers and was pleased once to have been a member of their team.  He wishes the Burra Broadcaster a long and successful future.
