Mr Charles J. Pearce will be 70 on 2 March.  He was born at Springbank where his father Mr William Pearce (tailor) then had a farm.  The family soon moved to Kooringa and after he left school Mr Pearce served an apprenticeship with Mr W.L.H. Bruse as a cabinetmaker.  After a few years he set up business for himself.  He has been a prominent Rechabite for 55 years and Secretary of the Rose of Sharon and Hope of Kooringa Lodges for 50 years.  In 1883 he married Miss Agnes Thomas, daughter of Mr Andrew Thomas and there are three surviving sons and four daughters.  Ptes Andrew & Courtney Pearce saw active service and the latter died in 1924 as a result of gassing and wounds.  A daughter, Leah, died over three years ago and another son, Colin, in 1906.
