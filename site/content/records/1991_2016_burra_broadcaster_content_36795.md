BCS.  Tony Ryan addressed an assembly on Friday 10 June.  He thanked the students, Roger Boehm and other members of the community who had participated in the creation of the sculpture, which went to Hay for his induction into the Shearer’s Hall of Fame.  He gave an excellent address, in which he said:

He was born in Burra in 1923.

He was educated at St Joseph’s School.

Was first a rouseabout with his brothers before becoming a shearer.

Later was a shearing contractor.

Joined the Australian Wool Board in 1964, developing shearer training.

Represented Australia demonstrating the Tally-Hi method of shearing in places like Central America, New Zealand and beyond.

Was nominated for the Shearers’ Hall of Fame by a lad he taught shearing 38 years ago.

Would be celebrating 59 years of marriage this year.

Was happy his eldest sister, Mary (90) could be present and also his brother, Tom.
