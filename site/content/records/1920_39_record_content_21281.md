Mrs Warnes thought the major towns like Burra should form an Association and after 12 months meet in Adelaide to decide where the big centre should be.  She said the main object was to have a rest or club room where a mother coming into town would have a rest room and somewhere to leave her little ones while she did her shopping and then later when established they could look at seaside camps, emergency help etc.

A motion was carried to form a District Service Association.

Mrs Warnes was unanimously elected the President.

Mrs Maurice Collins was elected Secretary and Mrs P.J. Pickering was chosen as Treasurer.

Mr Charles Wilkinson has offered a rent-free room at the rear of the stationery shop and Mrs Wilkinson has furnished it.
