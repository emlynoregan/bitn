Redruth Magistrate’s Court

J. McMasters, a shepherd, was charged with having on 10 June brought into the colony from NSW a flock of 9,000 sheep without a permit.  He was fined the minimum of £50 plus costs.

A man called Nourse was called on to show cause why he should not contribute to the support of two grandchildren whose father had deserted them.  No order was made, as the old man was barely able to support his own family.

W. Peel Nesbitt, Government Medical Officer, writes in reply to ‘A Lover of Fair Play.’

It is the duty of the Government Medical Officer to report to the central Board of Health, there being no Local Board of Health in the district.

It was not my duty to apply to anyone else in the first place for several reasons:

An Inspector was required to examine the place reported.

He and not I complained of the accommodation and ventilation.  I am the Government Medical Officer, not the District Council Medical Officer.  The District Council has no jurisdiction in such matters and does not know about typhoid fever.

The Government Medical Officer is ex officio a Medical Officer of Health.

I have held the appointment since November.

‘Considering the circumstances under which Dr Dashwood ceased to hold the appointment, I am surprised that he should have alluded to it.’

To Dr Cave’s letter I would reply:

I have never said the first case of typhoid occurred in Paxton Square, but

There were 9 cases there to my knowledge.  Dr Cave mentions one more (Morris) and I have seen one since, making a total of 11.

The fact that there are other places as bad or worse does not make Paxton Square good.

& 5.  Dr Cave says there was only one case of scarlatina in Paxton Square.  How does he know how many I saw?  And how many had no medical attendance at all?  I saw three cases there.  He says that the place is not a hotbed of disease and I said that unless his opinions had undergone a marvellous change he would bear me out.  ‘I can only regret they should have thus changed.’

To show I was not making a statement without foundation, I will quote a few figures.  The population of Burra at the last census was over 3,300.  The population of Paxton Square according to Captain Sanders is 161.  Dr Cave says there were 20 cases of scarlatina in the district and taking Dr Cave’s estimation of the number of cases (1) Paxton Square had more than its share, but including the cases I know of (4), it had more than three times its share.

Yet Dr Cave says there is less sickness there than in any other parts of the district.  Also Mr Daniel’s and Dr Cave’s own houses, though not actually, are, for all sanitary purposes, virtually in Paxton Square and in both fatal cases occurred.  By Dr Cave’s statement if Paxton Square had less sickness that any other part of the district there should have been over 100 cases of typhoid in the district and by my figure of 11 cases, the district should have had more than 220.

Captain Sanders accuses me of ‘interfering’ and is then surprised that I resent it.

‘Let Dr Cave write on this subject to Board of Health in Adelaide and see if those gentlemen do not place as much reliance on his statements as they did on those of Captain Sanders and Dr Dashwood.
