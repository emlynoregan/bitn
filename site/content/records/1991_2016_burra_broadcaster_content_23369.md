Burra District Swimming Club will begin the new season on 4 December.  The club is interested in promoting competitive swimming, but also in coaching people of all ages and abilities in the main swimming strokes and in the promotion of swimming for its health and fitness benefits.  The club is presently seeking a design for a logo to enable club members to stand out in a crowd and have an emblem to wear with pride.  A prize will be awarded for the best design.
