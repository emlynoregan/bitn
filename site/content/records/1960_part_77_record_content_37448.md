Rosemary Reed, who will be married early in the New Year, was given a farewell at the conclusion of the Advent Carol Service at St Mary’s on Sunday night.  It was noted that this probably meant the end of the Burra Anglican Quartet, whose members were Rosemary Reed, Jan Cockington, Alan Edwards and Geoffrey Sibly: the last being the founder.  It had been intended to farewell Mrs Mavis Kelly prior to her departure, but this had not been possible.  A presentation was made to Rosemary of a nest of tables.  [Details in c. 1 column.]
