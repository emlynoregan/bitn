Redruth Methodist Ladies’ Guild celebrated its 50th Anniversary last Thursday.  Mrs Reta Jennison has been the secretary for those 50 years and Mrs A.B. Riggs and Miss C.A. Reed were two of eight foundation members present.  Luncheon was held in the Redruth Memorial Hall where beautiful flower arrangements were done by Mrs Les White.  Olive Oates and Jan Cockington played light music.  Several former ministers attended with representatives from the town’s other guilds and the Catholic Women’s League.  Miss Clarice Reed gave the gold-iced birthday cake.  Mrs A.B. Riggs, who was the first treasurer, came from Adelaide with her daughter Lois and cut the cake.  Mrs Venning, formerly Mrs Dyer, the wife of the late Rev. Dyer, came to Burra in 1937 and she lit the candles.  After lunch there was time for reminiscences and performances from many with long associations with the church at Burra North.

Lindsay Thomas sang I shall not pass this way again and Lucky ‘ole Sun accompanied by his wife Joyce at the piano, who also played two pieces by Greig.
