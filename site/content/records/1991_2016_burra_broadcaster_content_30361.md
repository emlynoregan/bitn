Letter from Councillor Adrian Gill

Dear Sir,

I, along with all other councillors received a ‘notice of intention to commence legal proceedings’ from Douglas Wiltshire, which has not been acted on even though three months have passed.

I intend to stand at the next election and I challenge Mr Wiltshire and others, to also stand and let the electors decide who they want on Council.

This is the letter that the author has since circulated:

Notice of Intention to Commence Legal Proceedings

Notice is hereby given of intention to commence legal proceedings by way of a class action by a number of ratepayers within the regional [sic] Council of Goyder.

The Statement of Claim to be drawn will allege, but will not be restricted to the following claims: - Purported sale of O’Connor’s Shed and purchase of land from A & K McBride. Private Contracting, Office Renovations, Purchase of Equipment, Level of Rates within Burra Township, Funding to National Trust, Various Works Projects, Tendering Procedure and other matters unspecified at this time. The claim will allege:

1. That as a member of Council you have: 1.1 Breached you [sic] fiduciary duties to ratepayers. 1.2 Conspired to misrepresent, mislead or deceive ratepayers. 1.3 Acted in a negligent manner to the detriment of ratepayers. 1.4 Failed to act honestly in the discharge of your duties and responsibilities.

2. That as a member of Council and as alleged above, you have caused unspecified financial loss to the ratepayers and the community.
