Obituary.  Benjamin H. Beaven of Booborowie died in Burra Hospital 31 July.  He was born in Calne in Wiltshire and came to Australia in the Darra in 1875.  He immediately went t W.L. Marchantâ€™s Edeowie Station, north of Pt Augusta.  After three years he went to Strathalbyn for W.L. Marchant.  He later went to Booborowie Run in charge of rabbit destruction.  After about two years he was made manager of Wallellberdina Station, north of Pt Augusta and later became its owner.  After some years he sold it and came to Booborowie Station as manager for A.S. Browne (some 18 years ago).  When the station was divided for closer settlement he bought the homestead and considerable acreage around it, but in recent years he sold all but 70 acres and the homestead.  This last holding was sold to Mr I.J. Warnes only a few weeks ago.

He married Miss Laura Wigley, daughter of the late James Francis Wigley, who survives her husband with two sons: C. Beaven (Mannanarie) & Noel Beaven (WA).  Chris Beaven of Walkerville is a brother and the Bishop of Mashonaland in South Africa is another.

[Benjamin Henry Beavan aged 67.]
