Fire.  A Fierce Fire is Raging ‘Out East’

On Saturday the District Clerk, Mr F.N. Fabian, was alerted by Morgan Police that a bushfire near Morgan could extend and at 7 p.m. Morgan called for help.  By 8.30 seventy men with equipment had assembled and set off for Balah Station.  This is about 52 miles from Burra and owned by Messrs H.V. Lord & Sons and managed by Mr Donaldson.

From midnight further men and equipment were despatched.  The CWA under Mrs R. Ashton organised food and refreshment and Clare CWA assisted.

The fire was burning through scrub and grass country without fire breaks or roads.  Grass was tall, dry and luxuriant.  In places it ripped through tree tops without burning at ground level.  By Monday it was contained, but not out and it is still being watched carefully.  At one time it was burning on a 30-mile front and 120 square miles has been consumed.  Damage to stock is slight, but some fencing has gone.  Notable efforts were put in by Mr & Mrs Escott of Morgan, Stan Irlam, Rex, Jim and Tom Warnes of Koomooloo, Braeside and Old Koomooloo, by Andrew Tennant and the Radford Bros.

On Sunday evening the fire was visible from the top of Breakneck, some 50 miles away.  With the lush growth out east at present an unchecked fire could burn for hundreds of miles.
