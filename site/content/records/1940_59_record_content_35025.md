Obituary.  Mr Sydney Dayn [sic] Davis, a well-known north east identity died at Terowie Hospital on 13 January after a short illness.  He had been born at Mintaro 59 years ago and was a son of the late Sydney Dayn Davis, formerly of Mintaro and later of Wadnaminga Gold Fields and of Mannahill.  He was educated at Lefevre School, after which he went into business with his father at Mannahill.  In 1937 he acquired the licence of the Imperial Hotel in Terowie, where he remained for six and a half years.  Owing to ill health, he returned to Mannahill, where he ran a general store and was the postmaster until the time of his death.  He was a member of the Masonic Lodge at Terowie and Jamestown and a member of Manchester Unity.  He took a keen interest in social activities.  He is survived by a widow and four children: Mona, Mrs R. Stegall of Terowie; Clare, Mrs H.W. Macdonald of D’Lorah Downs Station; Gordon of Mannahill and Kathleen, Mrs L. Bailey of Whydown Station, Yunta.  [Born Sydney Daye Davis 18 April 1888 at Mintaro.  Death registration says Sydney Daryl Davis, but that could be a transcription error.]
