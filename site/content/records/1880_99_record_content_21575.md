Working Men’s Blocks.  A letter to the Editor from G.W. Cotton.  The Act empowers the Government to grant blocks of not more than 20 acres.  A clause requires residence on the land, but this is fulfilled if the wife and family are living there.  Under a similar Act in Victoria of 1865 over 17,000 blocks have been taken up in less than 5 years.  People can become self-supporting.
