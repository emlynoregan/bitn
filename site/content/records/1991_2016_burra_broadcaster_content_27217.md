Australian Greenhouse Office SunRace is an eight day gruelling trip from Adelaide to Sydney.  The solar powered cars will pass through Burra next Saturday, probably about noon, en route to their first overnight stop at Peterborough.  [The cited time of Adelaide to Peterborough in 2001 was 2 hours 41 minutes.  It would seem impossible for these vehicle to maintain an average of 90 km per hour for that distance over that route!]
