Burra Town Council, 4 June

Education Department advised that the Government was not at present prepared to subsidise swimming pools.

Sgt Davey thanked the Council for his appointment as Town Clerk and advised that he would obtain his release from military duties as soon as possible.

Mr McGubbin of the Sa Art Gallery advised that the painting of Dr Brummitt was in a hopeless condition and virtually nothing could be done to prevent it flaking; the problem lay in the priming.  A copy would cost a deal of money.

It was resolved to contact Mrs Forsythe (Dr Brummitt’s daughter) to see if she was prepared to do anything in the matter.

Letter.  ‘Burra North Ratepayer’ noticed that a certain person had been asked by Council to do up the fence.  Councillors should look around in a few more places.

Sgt & Mrs Stevenson are the guests of Mrs Stevenson’s parents, Mr & Mrs G. H. Dollman.

Mr M. Hegarty has returned to Burra after being on the Postal Department relieving staff at Jamestown.

Mr Jack Heron of the Burra Post Office, has been appointed Postmaster at Carrington.

LAC Dudley Field was on leave in Burra, and left on Wednesday with his sister ‘Midge’ for Mildura, where they will be the guests of their brother LAC Eric Field and his wife.
