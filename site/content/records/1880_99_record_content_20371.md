Letter from W.H.H. [Hardy] to say that after the fire at J.T. Walkers he had written that a fire hose etc. ought to be left at the police stations at either end of the town - now Mr Harveyâ€™s shop has been destroyed and all that was available were buckets.  The Council ought to see to it even at the cost of 1d on the rates.
