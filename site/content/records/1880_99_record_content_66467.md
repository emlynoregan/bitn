Salvation Army.  The annual social of the Salvation Army was held on 20 June.  Though hard work went into making it a success financially and otherwise, it was from a financial point of view, ‘a dismal failure’.  [The report is not clearly written, but it would seem likely that the failure refers more to the SA effort as a whole because in Burra they raised £20 which was up £7 on 1898 and £5 over their target.]
