Copper Deposits Near Burra

Recent acromagnetic surveys flown over SA have paid particular attention to the ‘Monster Mine’ site to record characteristics of the remaining ore deep within the ground and unusual geophysical features were sought in the surrounding area.  Sites were found several kilometres to the north that were worth following up.  Kimberlite deposits at Terowie were mapped.  The Department of Mines hopes the Challenger prospect, a new gold mine near Tarcoola, will be developed by 2000.
