Burra Mine.  Members of the Burra Apex Club have discovered the old miners’ entrance to Morphett’s Shaft.  The tunnel, which is about 18 metres from the shaft caved in during the 1920s and was also back filled.  The Department of Mines will fund its retimbering so that underground tours can be conducted.  A member of the club said it had taken about three weeks to find the entrance.
