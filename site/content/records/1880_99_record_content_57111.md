Burra Town Council.

The Mayor reported a memorial signed by 216 ratepayers protesting against the new by-law and asking Council to reconsider.  It was addressed to him and he did not bring it to Council because there were words in it that might be criticised.  He thought it should have some consideration.

[No doubt the words he was referring to were: ‘to express our unqualified disapproval and entire dissatisfaction at the conduct of certain councillors in advocating the addition of a new by-law’.]

Cr Hardy asked if the book containing the names of the streets, which was sent to Adelaide some time ago had been returned.

The Town Clerk said it had not been sent.

Cr Rabbich made a personal explanation of the charge he had laid against Inspector J.R. Gray.  He said that after the last Council meeting Gray had told a ratepayer that ‘Crs Rabbich and Hardy tried all they knew to accept the lowest tender for the carting of road metal, and he was surprised that working men in particular could support men like then’.

The Inspector asked if Cr Rabbich had heard him say anything about him.

Cr Rabbich refused to say.

Cr Sampson said Mr Gray should not be called on to make a statement without a definite charge being lodged in writing with the Clerk.

Cr Rabbich then wrote out the charge.
