C.C. Heinrich, licensee, gave evidence that Knevitt knew he was barred from the hotel on that day (a Sunday), but entered the back way about 10 a.m.  He left when told to but returned later at 9 p.m. the same day.  He refused to leave and argued with Heinrich who picked up a length of hose.  Heinrich prepared to fight him and Hall & Bewley tried to make him desist.  Heinrich said he only pretended to have a revolver in his back pocket.  When he sent for the police Knevitt left.  He denied hitting the defendant or using profane language.
