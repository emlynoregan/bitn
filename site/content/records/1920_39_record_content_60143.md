Burra Mine

[An article from the Adelaide Advertiser 19 February in the ‘Out Among the People’ section by ‘Vox’.]

People may say now ‘Oh for another Burra!’  We feel a time will come when there will be a cry of ‘Oh for another Mongolata!’  Mongolata is where the richest gold minted in the Commonwealth of Australia is found.  It is hard to believe that only one hill in the district has such mineral wealth and indeed geologists consider the surrounding hills are mineral bearing.  ‘Vox’ reports seeing a letter written by Mr John Brown dated 10 August 1847 to a Mr J.S. Williams in Brighton, England.  It concerns the phenomenal wealth produced at the Burra Mine.

‘We have paid two dividends of 50% each, which returns all the original capital and next week we pay the third dividend which will be 100% - all these since the middle of June.’  4,500 tons are at sea and 3,500 tons raised at the mine.  The quality is improving and our processes of washing and dressing are also improving.  I have lately visited the mine as a director and it has never looked better.  Prospects are unlimited.

I showed the letter to Mr Howard Lloyd, whose office was the headquarters of the old SA Mining Assoc. and he has many interesting records there.  In 19½ years it yielded £4,750,000 worth of copper ore and paid nearly half of that in wages.  Shareholders received £800,000 in dividends, or a return of £315 for every £5 share.  The invested capital was £12,320 only and no call was ever made.

In 1914 Mr Lloyd was appointed liquidator of the SA Mining Assoc.  On the walls of his office are interesting sketches of the mine in 1847 by S.T. Gill.  Perhaps more interesting is a long panoramic sketch of the mine painted by a stable boy who obviously made his green pigment out of copper ore.  Also on the mantelpiece are two fine geological specimens.

Gold.  In 1935, in response to rising prices, the SA production of gold went up.  25.6% came from privately operated batteries and 43.4% from Government batteries and cyanide works.  The remainder came from prospecting and mining across SA.  Of the Government batteries 19.2% came from Mt Torrens, 5.2% from Peterborough, 37.3% from Mongolata, 32.2% from Tarcoola and 6.1% from Glenloth, which only began operations in October 1935.  The peak year for gold in SA was 1904 – mainly due to the discovery of gold at Tarcoola in 1900.  (From the Advertiser 19 February.)
