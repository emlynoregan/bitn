Burra Institute.  There have been no pictures for three weeks due to the changes being made [for talkies] and knowing the Institute needs funds the Burra Brass Band held dances on these nights.  On 13 May for £13, on 20 May for £16 and on 27 May for £17.  A fourth dance has been requested for next Saturday.
