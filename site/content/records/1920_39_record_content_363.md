Polo Club.  Half a dozen responded to the call to re-form the club: Messrs G.G. Hawkes, The Murray Brothers, A. Tennant, S. Bright & M.A. Radford.  This being insufficient, re-establishment will be delayed while others are recruited, but some practice matches will be held (on the Show Grounds) in the hope of being ready for next season.  (The first one on 14 February.)
