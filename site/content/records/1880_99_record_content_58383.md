Burra Town Council, 15 October.

Various minor works were dealt with.

Ward finance figures were produced.

North Ward is £18-3-11 overdrawn.

East Ward is £5-19-1 overdrawn.

West Ward is £9-12-0 overdrawn.

The finance committee recommended a charge of £2 for the use of the oval and £2 for the shed.

Cr Sampson thought that £4-4-0 for the use of the oval and shed was exorbitant.

[This suggests that the recommendation was in guineas rather than pounds.]

He moved that the charge for the oval and shed be £3 per day where gate money is taken and £2 for the shed alone.  Sunday schools to have use of the oval for free and of the shed for 10/-.  Carried.
