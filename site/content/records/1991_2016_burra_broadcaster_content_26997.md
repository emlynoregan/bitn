Stillborn Babies Memorial

A group of people have been working quietly for some time to erect a memorial as a remembering place for people whose children were stillborn.  Many such babies were buried in unmarked graves at the Burra Cemetery.  The group has consulted with the Cemetery Committee and community members and has gained quotes for possible designs.  The memorial will be placed in the cemetery rotunda.  [The Mortuary Chapel.]  It will feature a bronze plaque mounted on a granite column with a heading: ‘A Place to Remember’.

The committee would be glad to receive any donations towards the project.  The cost is estimated to be c. $1,200.  The group hopes to place the memorial by the end of February.
