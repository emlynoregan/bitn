Burra Cycling Race

Held every year since 1907 except for gaps during WWI, WWII and the early 1950s.  The first race from Burra to Adelaide of 110 miles ended at the City Baths (Adelaide Festival Theatre site).  In the early years Burra to Adelaide races alternated with Adelaide to Burra races.  With the advent of traffic lights in the city the race could no longer terminate there and other courses were devised, finishing at Uley Road, Elizabeth, but again traffic conditions forced further change and since 1985 loops starting and finishing in Burra have been devised.  The 100 km 2008 Megafert Burra Classic was won by Reuben Menaud-Young.

[This article is a mixture of incorrect and misleading statements.  I have not done the research needed for a definitive description of the history of the event, but a few points from reports in the Burra Record will indicate some of the problems in accepting the above.

1.  In 1947 the Burra Mayor is reported as saying that he hoped that some day the race would be run from Adelaide to Burra – perhaps in the following year.  He would hardly be saying that if the race had been alternating its direction from ‘the early years’.  There was a period from 1948 when a roughly alternating pattern emerged.

2.  There were gaps during WWI & WWI – though not for all of the war years.

3.  There was a significant gap between 1925 and 1933 when the race was replaced by routes that did not include Burra, as listed (with winners) below:

1925	C. Hutton	(96 miles: Kapunda-Auburn-Tarlee-Adelaide)

1926	H. Opperman	(96 miles: Kapunda-Auburn-Tarlee-Adelaide)

1927	F. Arthur	(108 miles: Kapunda-Waterloo-Auburn-Tarlee-Adelaide)

1928	A. Smith	(130 miles: Adelaide-Mt Pleasant-Kapunda-Tarlee-Adelaide)

1929	H. Opperman	(130 miles: Adelaide-Mt Pleasant-Kapunda-Tarlee-Adelaide)

1930	F. Kennewell	(130 miles: Adelaide-Mt Pleasant-Kapunda-Tarlee-Adelaide)

1931	A. James

1932	K. Synnett	(155 miles: Adelaide-Kadina-Pt Pirie)

1933	J. Ryan		(60 miles: Adelaide-Templers-Adelaide)

4.  In the 1950s the picture is more complex.  The race was held 1950-52 and in 1953 the Burra-Adelaide race was stage three of the three-day ‘Advertiser Tour’.  In 1954 & 1955 The ‘Advertiser Tour’ passed through Burra, but the local paper’s report suggests it was not a Burra-Adelaide race.  The Adelaide-Burra event was revived in 1956 by the Goodwood Cycling Club.  The Norwood Club’s involvement came rather later.

5.  The finishing point in or near Adelaide did not just move to Elizabeth when traffic lights appeared in the city centre.  Work is needed on this, but it had a number of finishing points – one Burra Record report has an end point at the Windmill Hotel at Enfield and another ended at Modbury.

6.  A bit of research could probably establish the routes and winners and very likely the times and distances too, but until this is done we will just have to beware of accepting unchecked reports.]
