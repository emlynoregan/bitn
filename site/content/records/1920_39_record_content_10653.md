The Annual Show on 25 October was a great success with record entries in most classes.  Exhibits were better displayed.  Finances are sound.  The year began £30 in credit and ends about £13 in credit with some £20 spent on improvements, but nothing was paid off debentures or interest.  Wages of £40 is an excessive amount caused by the amount of material that has to be shifted each show.  We need more money to improve the show.  The Salvation Army took charge of luncheon.
