RSL AGM 20 February at the club rooms in Kooringa.  The annual report showed a successful year despite the depression and the committee was to be congratulated on holding two successful balls that benefited the club’s finances considerably.  Many members attended the unveiling of the State War Memorial on Anzac Day 1931 and attendance at the local Anzac Day service on Sunday 26 April was large.  A collection of nearly £12 benefited the AIF Cemetery Fund.  Armistice Day was observed and Poppy Day raised £4-5-0.  An appeal for wheat for Angorichina Hostel raised 30 bags.  The Brandt fund has paid £116-12-2 to the widow and there is a balance of £46-18-11.
