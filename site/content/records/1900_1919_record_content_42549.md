Patriotic Meeting at Farrell’s Flat

A meeting at Farrell’s Flat on Saturday night to consider celebrating Australia Day was addressed by E.W. Crewes and Mr Winnall.

Mr Crewes gave a stirring patriotic speech and was proud to come from Burra where, with only 1,750 people they had raised over £1,500 and sent 128 men to the front.  On Violet Day they had raised £414.  Gawler had managed £45 and Adelaide £750.

Mr Winnall followed.

[The patriotic enthusiasm and the claiming of the moral high ground for Burra backfired on this occasion however, and Mr Bartlett, no doubt expressing views shared by others, took offence at the implication that Farrell’s Flat had not done its bit and also at the fact that Burra’s catchment area for donations extended to within two miles of Farrell’s Flat, where a man giving £20 to the Burra Fund would have had more credit if he had donated it locally.]

Mr Winnall apologised if he had trodden heavily on somebody’s corns.  He had no thought of belittling the town.

But this did not quite quell the situation.

Mr Denton moved a vote of thanks to the speakers and said while Mr Bartlett had taken what was said in the wrong way, the Mayor must have known that a portion of Violet Day money had come from the Hanson District and it would hurt people’s feelings to have it all claimed for Burra.

Mr Crewes then said he was sorry he came and took Mr Denton’s remarks as an insult.  Some of his friends lived in Farrell’s Flat and he would not travel there to insult them.  If he had said anything to hurt their feelings he apologised.

A committee was then formed to organise Australia Day at Farrell’s Flat, but by that time anything said was interpreted as an insult by one side or the other and the meeting was adjourned.

One result of the above meeting was that Mr Ley, as Chairman of the District Council, who had invited the Mayor and Mr Winnall, grew so disgusted by the attitudes of the ratepayers as expressed at the meeting that he resigned as Chairman of the District Council and has since refused to change his mind.
