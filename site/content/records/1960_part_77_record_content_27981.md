Obituary.  Mr Willie (Bill) Voumard died on Thursday night aged 90.  [There was also a death notice on page 2.]

He was born in Berne, Switzerland, 19 October 1875 and came to Australia aged 6.*  The family came to live at Copperhouse and moved into Burra when he was aged 9.  He died in the house that had been his home for 81 years.  In early life he worked on a number of eastern pastoral properties.  He was an enthusiastic cyclist and on many occasions would ride 50 or 60 miles from his place of employment to a sports meeting and then compete in events.  He won a number of medals and trophies and on one such occasion won a 50 mile race in a little over two hours.  He continued to ride his bike in Burra up to the time of his death.  In 1906 he married Florence Minetta Brandt and they had eight children before she died in 1924.  He then left the ‘Eastern’ Country and came to work in Burra for the Burra Town Council until retiring some years ago.  In 1927 he married Clara Ellen McLennan who died in 1957.  He is survived by Fred, Ruby (Mrs Jack Rowe), Jack, Lance, Jean (Mrs Murray Opperman), May (Mrs Joff Parkes), Ida (Mrs Norman Hyde) and Edna (Mrs Jack O’Keefe).

[William Voumard died 10 February 1966, Burra.]
