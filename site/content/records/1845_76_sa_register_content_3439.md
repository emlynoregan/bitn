The Burra Burra Mine Strike is over.  Those men who could afford to hold out and who were proscribed by the Directors, having withdrawn their opposition.  A considerable number of pitches were let last week at the Captain’s prices.  The number of applicants was large.  About 300 are presently employed, with more to come.

There is about 2,000 tons of ore at grass and the Directors, who with the Secretary, returned to Adelaide on Saturday, had decided on a temporary suspension of cartage to the port.  The want of this employment will have less impact because the Patent Copper Co. has advertised for workers at their Kooringa copper works.  There are said to be many applicants for land near the route between Burra Burra and Adelaide.

Governor’s Visit to Burra Burra.  While visiting Burra Burra His Excellency donned underground clothes and was shown around the diggings.  [Sir Henry E.F. Young.]  The Governor expressed much astonishment and gratification at what he saw.
