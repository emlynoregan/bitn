Burra Conservation Study

Recommendations for the Kooringa Precinct.

As an historic, commercial and residential centre modern buildings should be ‘in sympathy’. 

The quality of its stone structures should be maintained and enhanced.

The ‘gateways’ to Burra precinct should be enhanced, but left uncluttered.

All remaining slate and bluestone kerbing and flagging in the precinct should be retained and a policy of reflagging of kerbing and of footpaths in the main Commercial Centre should be considered.

Unsympathetic buildings, structures and hoardings should be discouraged.

Maintain, enhance and restore historic structures or relics which constitute Burra’s historic heritage e.g. shingle the iron roofing of the jinker shed.

Is the cement edging around the Rotunda in keeping?
