Burra Burra DC had invited the Engineer of the Highways and Local Government Department to inspect and advise on local roads.  He did so on 17 April with respect to Burra-Booborowie, Gum Creek, Farrell Flat-main road, the new Hanson-Black Springs road, the new Hanson-Burra road, the bridge at the bottom of ‘Breakneck’ and the bituminising of Booborowie main street.

Burra Burra Show Inc.  The appeal for funds to cover the Flower Pavilion improvements has stalled at £21-15-0.  A further £75 is needed.

Willalo School.  Work has started on building the new school next to the Memorial Hall. It is thought it will be completed quickly.

The Swing Bridge opposite the Town Hall will be replaced.  AMRCO Aust. Pty Ltd has quoted for two-ten plate multi-plate arches each 5 ft wide with a span of 25 ft, giving a rise of 12 ft 9 inches at a cost of £428-5-0 less 7% F.O.R. Sydney.  It was decided to order the spans, which will be the basis for a solid construction bridge to be erected a little north of the old bridge, to serve as a crossing for the school and the swimming pool.  The old bridge will later be removed.
