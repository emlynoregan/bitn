Burra Swimming Pool Committee AGM 21 March

Elected: President, H.J. Topsfield; Treasurer, B.E. Gryst & Secretary, R.G. Jeffery.  On advice from Mr P. H. Quirke it was decided to approach the Government for a further subsidy.

President’s Report

On 2 March 1956 a public meeting voted almost unanimously to carry out the construction of a pool.  A committee was elected comprising H.J. Topsfield as President and Chairman; R.G. Jeffery as Secretary and B.E. Gryst as Treasurer.  Funds collected by various means now stand at c. £1,000, which was the goal aimed at by the end of 1956.  Although not quite enough to complete the project, the committee felt it was enough to allow a start.  Trees were removed from the site.  The Burra Burra DC began scooping out the hole, but were interrupted by the Murray Flood Appeal and it was then decided that the project could not be completed by the end of 1956.  Necessary ground work has continued.  An architect has prepared plans and materials have been ordered and the cement should come any time now.  Mr Milton Mitchell was hired to level the floor of the pool and a working bee in the next fortnight should get this to the stage that concrete can be put down.
