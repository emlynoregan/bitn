Burra Citizens’ Militia Force

E.W. Crewes addressed the meeting last Wednesday night with patriotic fervour.

Cr Lane moved a company be formed and G. Lawn 2nd.  Lieut. Copley moved the name be the Burra Citizens’ Militia Force.  A.D. McLaren 2nd.

Lieut. Copley said that as matters proceeded it would be necessary to approach the State Commandant for various things e.g. the Drill Hall, which was nearing completion.  This would be very useful for night parades and lectures.

Captain Lord asked if members of the Rifle Club would be able to join – they already being a body of reserves.  Lieut. Copley thought both they and members of the Light Horse could do so.

Lieut. Killicoat said there were very few of the Light Horse left in Burra now, but those had decided to help this movement in any way they could.

The committee would need to clarify the company’s status.

SM Morell said instructors would be a major problem.

A committee was elected and names taken.
