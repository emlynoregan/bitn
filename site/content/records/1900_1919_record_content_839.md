Methodist Union.  A special meeting was held on Wednesday, chaired by the Premier Mr F.W. Holder, who said he had spent 17 happy years in the town and regretted the severance that would come with the approaching federal election.  He also regretted the loss of Dr Brummitt, both for the church and the town.  An illuminated address was presented to Dr Brummitt who made an appropriate response.  A purse of sovereigns was given to John Pearce who was for 30 years organist of the Wesleyan Church and a clock to H. Pearce, who is moving to Adelaide.
