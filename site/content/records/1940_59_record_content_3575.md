Mr A. Davey completed 50 years as librarian at the Institute on 14 October.  His father, Mr William Davey had been librarian for 22½ years when he called Arthur away from school to assist.  Mr William Davey resigned 37 years ago and Mr A.A. Davey took over.  In the early days the library was situated in a partitioned off part of the main hall. The library was first catalogued in the latter end of Mr William Davey’s time.  In the old days the library was open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. except Sundays, Christmas Day and Good Friday.  Mr Arthur Davey has had virtually no holidays and his longest break has been just recently when he was in hospital for a fortnight.
