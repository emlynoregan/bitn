Charles William Preiss was fined 10/- for being drunk in charge of a vehicle.  He left Kooringa for Baldina, but being ‘kinder queer’ fell into a sound sleep and the horses went off along the wrong road.  At the Mine Bridge they turned left and finally pulled up at Mr West’s residence.  The police were notified and Mr Preiss spent the night in a cell.  He was also fined 5/- + costs for driving without a light.
