Obituary.  George Pryde died on 18 May at his residence near Booborowie.  He was born at Gum Ck nearly 62 years ago and resided there before his marriage in 1900 to Caroline Trevilyan, daughter of the late George and Mary Trevilyan of Copperhouse.  They lived briefly at Broken Hill, but soon returned to SA and finally purchased a lucerne block on the Booborowie Flats and for the last 28 years carried on dairying and pig-raising.  He took a keen interest in all public affairs.  He was a foundation member of the Booborowie District Soldiers’ Memorial Institute, a member of the hall committee and a trustee.  He was for a period Chairman of the Agricultural Bureau and a Councillor for the Booborowie DC.  A widow and a family of one son and two daughters survives: Mrs E.J. Affolter (Booborowie), Mrs A.J. Cousins (Iron Knob) & Mr Hector Pryde (Spalding) [Corrected on 4 June to Bull’s Creek.]  There are two sisters: Mrs R. Nourse of Pt Pirie and Mrs J. Doyle of Mt Bryan East.
