Burra Rifle Club.  The general meeting on Saturday at the RSL Rooms saw members decide unanimously to drill with the RSL on Sunday morning as a result of the Defence Dept. permitting members to train as VSDs.  A motion was passed calling for ammunition to be provided on the basis of average attendance and not on the number of so-called efficient members.  Many clubs have many members, but low attendance.  20 members attended the drill on Sunday, despite the short notice.
