£5 was donated to the Red Shield Appeal.

RSL writes asking for a returned man to be appointed Town Clerk when the job comes up, with a temporary position to be created if a returned man was not then available.

The Mayor was in favour, as long as he was a front line soldier and qualified for the job.

Cr Kellaway said he hoped the sponsors of the letter ‘would follow the example re the employment of returned soldiers which would be set by this Council’.

‘His Worship – Yes and not employ “dagos”.’

Cr Lee was surprised at some returned men from the last war employing prisoners of war.
