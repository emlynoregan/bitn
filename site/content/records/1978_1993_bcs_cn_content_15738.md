Burra & District Lions Club has provided a Community Bus Service for many years now on Thursday mornings – operated by O’Connor’s Bus Service.  Those using it provide a nominal charge to keep the cost to Lions down.  Patronage has been pleasing, but there are vacant seats and anyone in the community is welcome to use the service.
