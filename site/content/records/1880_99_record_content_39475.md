Christmas in Burra

Christmas Eve was fine and pleasant, shops were well decked out and windows handsomely decorated, business places were festooned with gum, pine and pepper with bannerettes, monograms and mottoes.  A large number of Chinese lanterns were ready for evening.  After tea large crowds, young and old, male and female, thronged the footpaths which couldn’t cope with them all.  About 7.30 p.m. the Burra Band directed by Mr Davey drew immense crowds of listeners.  The night was moonlight and with many Chinese lanterns was well illuminated and everyone was cheerful.  Shops did better trade than last year, many doing a ‘roaring trade’.  Early in the evening one or two fights broke out among the ‘amateur pugs’, but by midnight with stores closed the carol singers came out and the band got down to the serious job of seasonal music to usher in Christmas Day.  Harmonious music continued until day began to break and quietness finally descended.

The main event of Christmas morning was the Christmas & Hospital Service at the Wesleyan Church, attended by the Town Council, Friendly Societies, Volunteer Forces and the Hospital Board.  The Burra Band led the procession from the Institute.  The collection raised £7-£8 for the Hospital.  The Anglican and catholic Churches also had their usual Christmas services which were fairly well attended.  In early afternoon large numbers were lounging about the streets while hotels were fairly patronised.  Picnic parties went to Princess Royal and other parties went shooting.  Some went to tea at the Primitive Methodist Church anniversary function.  After tea the usual games filled the time till the public meeting at 7.30 p.m.  Proceeds for the day were good.
