The Burra Ministers’ Fraternal at their last meeting passed the following two resolutions:

‘That this Fraternal stands solidly behind the Mayor, (Mr H.J.B. Jennison) on his stand against organised Sunday Sport.’

‘That this Fraternal deplores any attempts to use Good Friday as a common holiday especially for such functions as Easter Tournaments.  We declare to our people that our churches are solidly against this practice.’
