Burra & District War Memorial Project

A meeting of ratepayers in Burra Town Hall on Monday 14 July resolved that the War Memorial Project be a first class sports centre at Victoria Park.

The meeting was not particularly well attended, but the discussion was thorough.

The Mayor, Mr H.J.B. Jennison presided.  The town could only afford one effort and four had been suggested:

A swimming pool for which about £1,000 could be made immediately available.

The levelling and beautifying of Victoria Park.

Development of a Community Sports Centre at the Racecourse with the co=operation of the Sports Syndicate.

Liquidate the debt on the Town Hall.

Mr A.B. Riggs moved that the town have a Memorial.  Carried.

Mr T.H. Woollacott moved that the Town Hall debt be liquidated and the Town Hall be the memorial scheme.  The debt was something over £3,000 and he could not recall when anything had last been paid off the capital.  The State Bank valued it at £10,000 and once paid for it would be an asset against which an overdraft could be raised at any time.  Last year it lost £68 and with the days of Red Cross dances etc. gone this would only increase in the future.  Cr Marston said the recent rough statement of income and expenditure showed a profit of £68: not a loss.  Further the Council was not charging itself rent on the Town Hall, which would cost them £65, so in reality the building last year made a profit of £133.

Mr R.C. Lott moved as an amendment that the creek be dammed.  Cr S.J. Woollacott seconded.

He estimated the cost at £2,000.  There was no intention to make the whole creek a swimming pool, but a small portion could be given a cement floor.  Mr Morrison said there was no current to keep the creek from being stagnant.  Cr Woollacott detailed a method of keeping it clean by the force of erosion, but after further debate the amendment was lost.

Mr L. Hawk/Hawke [depending on where you look] moved an amendment that Victoria Park be the Memorial.  The Victoria Park Committee had not intended the work there to be the Memorial, but had sought to have the £400 from the swimming pool fund freed for the oval improvements.  The site was hardly large enough for all the town’s sporting facilities, but would be used mainly for football and cricket.  They envisaged:

Grading and levelling the oval.

Installing a turf wicket.

Installing a saucer track for cycling.

Removing dead and useless trees and the erection of a grandstand in the northwest corner.

The existing shed would be removed and the iron used in the new grandstand roof.  The committee believed that if the £400 were used to liquidate the Town Hall debt it would not attract the two-thirds rebate which was only available if the money were spent on capital works.  The racecourse option was not sufficiently central to the town and was a very windy site.  It was also doubtful if the £400 could be spent there, as it was not public property.  The cost was estimated at £650.  Seconded by Mr C. Radford and carried.
