‘Heathmont’, previously the home of Mrs Sandland, is expected to be opened as a registered Private Hospital for the aged at about Christmas time, by Sister S.L. Barnes.  She is a former Royal Adelaide hospital trainee with 20 years’ experience and several certificates gained overseas.  At present she is at a similar institution ‘Preston’ Private Hospital at Semaphore.  It will be all electric.  A large American TV set has been purchased.  TV was installed at the ‘Preston’ Hospital in March*.  Burra Burra Dc had a population of 1,428 in 1954 of whom 263 were over 60 and 196 were 65 or over.  [This is interesting as TV did not start in Adelaide until 1959 – and when did it reach Burra?]
