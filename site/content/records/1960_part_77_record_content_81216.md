Burra CWA has guests from nearly 30 branches for its 50th birthday celebrations on Friday at a special luncheon at the Burra Town Hall.  The guests included the State President, Mrs Cooper; Group President, Mrs Lambert and Divisional President, Mrs Klem.  Burra Branch President Mrs David Baker was a gracious hostess and a small brochure summarising the history of the branch was compiled by Mrs Baker.  International Day was also celebrated and this year the study was Kenya.  Floral decorations were by Mrs Les White and Miss Gwen Humphrys.  The only foundation member able to attend was 93-year-old Mrs Marks.  After a short business meeting Mrs Cooper gave an address.  [This is reported at some length.]

Mrs Baulderstone made the birthday cake, which was iced and decorated by Mrs Merv. Cox.
