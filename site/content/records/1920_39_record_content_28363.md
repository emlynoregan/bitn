Obituary.  The late Thomas Parks was born at Hindmarsh in 6 Sept 1849 and was brought to Burra when only a few months old by his parents Mr & Mrs Thomas Parks Sen. who founded the bakery business now carried on by his only surviving son Mr Charles Parks.  On leaving school Thomas Parks was employed at Bath and Pearce and on their retirement he continued with Pearce Bros.  He spent over 40 years with the former and another 5 with the Pearce Bros. till they ceased business.  He then transferred to Drew & Crewes until ill health forced his retirement.  He suffered from rheumatism for many years, but regularly attended the Methodist Church until unable to walk the distance.  He was for 56 years a member of the Rechabite Lodge.  He married Hannah Martha Newman on 25 December 1872.  He is survived by a widow and one son, William Francis Parks of Kooringa and four daughters: Mesdames Alice J. Seymour (Pt Pirie), Florence M.
