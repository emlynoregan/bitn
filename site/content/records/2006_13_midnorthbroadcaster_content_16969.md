World War I Soldiers Project

With the centenary of the outbreak of World War I approaching in 2014 and the centenary of the landing at Gallipoli in the following year, The Burra History Group is preparing a descriptive list of the servicemen and servicewomen who appear on the large roll of Honour in the Burra RSL Room/Council Chamber.

The intention is to provide family researchers and other interested parties with a brief summary of family details so that the bare surname and initials on the roll can be properly identified.  To do this we have tried to find the full name, date and place of birth and the name of the parents, for each person on the Honour Roll.  We have then outlined the bare details of their war service and, where possible this has been supplemented with a photograph.

A significant number of the servicemen wrote letters home that were published in the Burra Record.  We aim to include these because they bring to life the personalities of these young men from a century ago.  The first groups of young volunteers from Burra went to Egypt and from there to the appalling conditions of Gallipoli.  Many were then transferred to France and endured the unimaginable horrors of the Western Front in France and Belgium.  Some became prisoners of war.  Others remained in the Middle East and saw action in Palestine as the allied forces fought their way north to Syria.  A few served in the Royal Australian Navy and one or two transferred to the Australian Flying Corps in the later stages of the conflict.  Another small group joined up in England and served with the British Army.  A small number of nurses saw service in the UK, France, the Middle East, India, and on hospital ships.

The letters reveal fascinating details of their experiences, some of which are remarkably frank about the conditions, considering that they passed through censorship.  There are accounts of experiences at the front, but even more about personal thoughts and experiences on leave.  Some soldiers in England managed to see quite a lot of the tourist sites and those struggling up though Palestine recount how the Bible was coming to life before their eyes, as they visited Bethlehem, Jerusalem or Jericho.

Since there are 490 names on the Honour Roll, gathering this information has been a large task spread over several years.  In the end it is intended to make the results available in digital format and we are investigating ways of making the material accessible at a couple of sites in the town and on a CD.  At this stage we have completed the collection of the basic material for most of those on the roll, but we need some help to complete the undertaking.
