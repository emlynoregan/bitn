At the funeral on Friday bearers were members of the Oddfellows Lodge of which Mr Grow was a very old member.  They were: S. Kellaway Sen. Lance Tiver, W.H. March, A. Lomman, Robert Fuss & Alwin T. Pearce.  [Marriage records suggest three marriages.  He first married Martha Keam or Kearn in 1866; who died in 1885.  Then he seems to have married Mary Jane Tilling in 1886, and although there is no registration of her death in SA, he married Rose Margaret Sanders or Saunders in 1890.  She survived, dying in 1939.  The children came from the first and third of these marriages.]
