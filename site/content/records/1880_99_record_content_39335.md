W.T Rabbich writes in reply to D.J. O’Leary.  He is rather waffly, but makes the point that it is a bit much to expect him to water 426 trees at an average distance of 250’ from a stand pipe.  He contends again (as originally) that sufficient pipe arrived to be installed before the pumping stopped for repairs.

Who is responsible if not Cr O’Leary?  Fancy trying to shield behind grasshoppers!
