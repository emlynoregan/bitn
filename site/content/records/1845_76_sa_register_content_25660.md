Hallett.  14 May.  A meeting has been held at Broad’s Hotel to discuss the desirability of petitioning for a District Council for the Hundred [of Hallett], instead of being annexed to the Hundred of Kingston [in the DC of Mt Bryan].  A memorial will be forwarded to the authorities, the local member will be asked for support and a committee has been formed to carry out these moves.
