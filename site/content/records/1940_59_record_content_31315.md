Copperhouse.  Century-old house to be sold.

When the home of the late John Nickles is offered by auction by Elder, Smith & Co. on 14 May it will sever the last link of the family with the district.  The house has been owned by the Nickles family for nearly 100 years and at the death of its first owner, Mr John Nickles, passed to his children and then to his grandchildren, all of whom were born and educated at Copperhouse.  The last of the family to live there were Mr & Mrs J.S. Nickles and when Mr Nickles died Mrs Nickles went to live in the city.
