Annual Seaside Trip.  This took place in cool conditions on Saturday 16 February and conditions were ideal for swimming and picnicking.  The train left Hallett at 5.09 and departed Burra 5.50 a.m.  Others joined at stations to Manoora.  Breakfast was taken at Riverton and the engine was changed at Dry Creek for the ‘back country’ run to Semaphore.  Numbers this year were down to just over 700.  The mayor and Town Clerk of Pt Adelaide greeted the visitors.  About a third immediately went to the city for shopping or the Interstate Cricket match etc.  Others enjoyed the sea at semaphore and picnicked.  The return train left at 8.10 p.m. and arrived at Burra at 12.20 a.m.
