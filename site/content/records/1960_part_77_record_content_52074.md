Burra Burra DC made a presentation at their annual meeting yesterday to Mr E.T. Baulderstone who had served as a Councillor and Mayor for 24 years.  Chairman Mr R. Jeffery spoke of the service of Mr & Mrs Baulderstone to the Town and District.  He was supported by Cr B.A. Riggs, Cr C.L .Phillips, Cr G.R. Finch & Cr R.B. Jennison.  Mr Baulderstone replied on behalf of his wife and also acknowledged the wonderful support she had given him throughout the period of his service.  He hoped the Mine might last the 15 years anticipated, but if it should not go longer, then he was sure tourism would play a big part in the future of Burra.  He hoped the mining operation would not destroy too many relics of the old Mine.
