The loss for 1945-46 was £376-11-9 and for 1946-47 was £242-3-10 for a total loss over the whole period of £618-15-7. He said the rates should be increased by 6d and even then great care would need to be exercised to make ends meet.

He was glad that the CWA ladies were interested in taking over the Lodge Room as a CWA Rest Room.  He was sure they would then do all they could to liquidate the Town Hall debt.

During the year the Council had done as much as it could to attend to all town roads and water tables.  In future he would like to see the Cemetery Road (Ayers Street) bituminised right through.

He thanked the District Council for its co-operation.  Parklands and tennis courts had been attended to so that there were now good courts at Burra and Burra North. Victoria Park had been graded and certain other parks named after prominent people in the town.  The cemetery had been cleaned up and was in reasonably good order.  They had a lot of trouble with noxious weeds and they were seeking Government assistance in eradicating them.

When the Housing Trust had visited Burra, Mr Pritchard had offered them the land at the south end of Victoria Park for a mere song.  Therefore it was possible that new houses might be erected there in the near future.  The town had more street lights and some had been made stronger.  More were needed in back streets.

The Council had suggested a Town War Memorial Scheme and that matter would be discussed at another ratepayers’ meeting on 14 July.  He paid tribute to the Victory Committee, of which Mr T.H. Woollacott was the Chairman.  Plaques would soon be placed on the memorial in remembrance of those who had sacrificed their lives in the war.  Trees that had been removed had been replaced by others.  He had been informed that a new residence for the Headmaster of the High School would be erected in the next few months.

There was little unemployment or distress in the town. Burra had responded well to worthy appeals throughout the year.

His Worship thanked all Councillors and especially those retiring, Crs Carpenter, Kellaway and Reed.  He congratulated the new Councillor for North Ward, T.H. Woollacott MBE.

The retiring Councillors responded.

Cr Kellaway did not regret the time spent on a series of committees, as all had contributed to the town’s progress.  Some said Burra was stagnant, but good bitumen roads now extended through much of it.  The only way to speed up progress was to get industry into the town.  He cited Shearers at Mannum as an example of how an industry boosted the amount of money in circulation in a town.
