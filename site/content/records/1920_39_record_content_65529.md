Aberdeen Croquet Club.  At Aberdeen on 14 January: Aberdeen defeated Hallett 3 games to 1.

Burra Racing Club met on Wednesday when it was decided to form it into a Private Ltd Co. The club was reformed in 1936 after a grant of about £150 from the Betting Control Board.  Prize money at the last meeting was £200 – rather ambitious as the club’s meeting was only one day after the Balaklava meeting.  A satisfactory day’s sport resulted and all prize money had been paid and there was at present a credit balance of £178.  The course fixtures were in good order and the next meeting was scheduled for 14 April.  Prize money will be about the same.  The main race will offer £10 less, but with the addition of a trophy from Mr Michael Gebhardt.  Mr Bednall explained that the reason for suggesting a limited company was that some years ago the old club got into financial trouble and the guarantors had to dig deep into their own pockets, which had killed off racing in Burra for some years.  If it were made into a private company the club’s funds would be responsible for any deficit.  The present club should agree to hand over all assets and liabilities to the new company, which would then issue shares.  Nominal capital would be £500 in 1,000 shares of 10/- each.  The company would not pay dividends.  [Other details are listed.]  The change was moved by A.L. Bence, seconded by Con. Samuel and carried.
