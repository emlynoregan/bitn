Sir Hubert Wilkins visited the district last Tuesday and Wednesday.  He was born at Mt Bryan East.  He refused a civic reception.  He camped the night at the old homestead, now roofless, at Mt Bryan East and visited in the morning his childhood haunts of yabby holes etc.  He recalls when about 4 years old getting up and starting in for the Burra sales at 3.30 a.m.  His father would stop at the Bon Accord for a glass of beer ‘to warm one up’ after the cold drive in and would give the 4-year-old one too.  Sir Hubert stopped in at the Bon Accord on this visit for a glass of beer too.  He visited Mt Bryan East School, but declined an invitation to Mongolata and had not the time for a Burra sheep sale either.  On Wednesday morning he visited Burra landmarks and shops and met a number of townspeople.
