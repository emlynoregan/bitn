Victory Day

A committee is preparing for the celebrations to take place on Victory Day, 10 June.  Burra Races would be held that weekend and a football match played in the afternoon.

Mr Jennison suggested a big parade of all patriotic organisations commencing at 10.30 a.m. to follow the normal Anzac March route and then a short service at the Memorial, followed by an adjournment to Victoria Park for a picnic lunch and then childrenâ€™s sports preceding the football match.  Business places are to display bunting and illuminations at night.  The Mayor will try to arrange some sort of fireworks for the night and Mr R.C. Lott agreed to build a large bonfire on the school hill.  Victory medals will be presented to school children on the Monday afternoon.

A combined Thanksgiving Service in the Town Hall on Sunday night is also a possibility.

It has been suggested that any funds raised go towards the purchase of plaques to be added to the monument in Market Square, bearing the names of those who have sacrificed their lives.
