After questioning Mr Radford ‘remembered’ (eventually) having written the letter from the Polo Club that caused this.

Mr Treloar said:

In 1908 the present grounds came onto the market.  Mr Thomas Sandland thought of buying it for sports use.  After it was bought it was necessary to make an exchange with Mr Austin and later to acquire more land for racing.  Mr A.G. Gebhardt gave a piece of land and the other members of the Burra Sports Trust gave an equivalent in money to enable improvements.  The seven gentlemen of the Trust had bought the land and also made two subsequent calls of £15 and £37.  As soon as it was formed the Trust offered the Show Society the use of the grounds for five years free of charge and agreed to erect a grandstand for the first show there in 1909 and in fact this extended to eight years, after which they were given a 21-year right to hold the show at £3-3-0 p.a.  He strongly opposed the motion.

J.R. Field agreed and Mr Radford’s remark that it was too far away was bunkum.  He was sure any difficulties over the jumps being moved could be sorted out and an agreement reached securing the Society’s position.

W.G. Hawkes was in the dark about why they needed to move – he thought it suicidal to leave such a beautiful ground – close to the railway station and convenient in every way.  The move would be a terrible mistake.

Mr Warnes then sought to explain the matter before them.

The present ground was one of the best in SA, but it was embodied in a sports syndicate.  In England and all other states Show Societies had their own grounds.  He would like to see this society have its own ground.  They would never get on until they had their own ground.  The syndicate was of respected and trusted men, but they had been asked to shift and one never knew what would follow next.  Moving the jumps was not insignificant.  It used to cost £40 p.a., though members now helped financially so the cost to the society was £20-£25.  This sum over a few years amounted to a considerable amount which could be put to better use.  At present they did not know who was boss, there was no privacy, no keys were kept on the place.  They used to have four jumps, now there were three – where was the other – used to light someone’s fire he supposed.  When the present syndicate men passed on who was to know what security there would be.  He hoped that whatever decision was made would not impair previous good feeling.  He would be out of office next year, but would be just as interested in the society.  All he wanted was a prosperous society.

Mr McWater’s motion was then put and lost by a big majority amidst applause.

Mr Warnes then asked for any suggestions for improving the society.

A.B. Riggs wanted dead wood removed from committees.
