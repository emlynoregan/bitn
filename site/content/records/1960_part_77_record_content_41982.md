Burra Mine

The Mine area was visited yesterday by the Minister of Mines the Hon. R.C. De Garis, the Director of Mines Mr Barnes, the Local MP Mr E.C. Allen and a representative of Mines Exploration Ltd Mr Roberts.  It is part of a familiarisation study by Mr De Garis of areas of the state with mineral resources.  Mr De Garis said studies had shown the presence in Burra of sufficient copper ore (something like 1Â½%).  There remains the problem of gaining the ore on a commercial basis.  Tests continue, but how long it will take to get a breakthrough is unknown.
