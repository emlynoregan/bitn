Burra CWA celebrated its 60th birthday recently.

Prior to a pooled luncheon, visitors were given a trip around Burra, visiting Malowen Lowarth and the restored Paxton Cottages.  In the afternoon they were entertained with items by Mavis Thomas and Marie Abbott.  Mallala branch members performed a very funny skit ‘The Waitress’ and the two Woolley girls sang.
