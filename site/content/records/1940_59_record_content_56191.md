Burra Progress Association and the Caravan Park Project

Mr W. Carpenter reported an anonymous donation of £25 and that the ‘Ten Meanest People’ had raised £26.  [Though 80, 41, 14 Oct. 1952, page 1 says £31.]  A dance is to be held tonight in the RSL Hall and a competition guessing the weight of a sheep will be run at the show.  It is anticipated that the needed £100 will be raised.  The Mayor said there was c. £45 in hand and if the £100 comes in and the government subsidy is approved, then the £290 total should allow a fairly up-to-date park with the necessary conveniences.  A suggestion of school boys’ cycle races is being considered.
