Mid North Passenger Transport Service currently has two complimentary [sic] services available to the Burra Community.  [Given that there is a charge for either of these services, perhaps ‘complementary’ was intended.]

The Medical Service leaves either Clare or Burra Mondays to Friday, excluding Thursdays, and costs $20 return.  The Shoppers Shuttle runs each Thursday morning from home to Market Square, with first pick-ups at 9 a.m. and with the return from Market Square departing at about 11 a.m.  The charge is $3 return for concession holders and $6 for non-concession.  Bookings are necessary.
