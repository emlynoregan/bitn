St Mary’s Kooringa.  On Saturday the Sunday school scholars had their half-yearly tea.  A band led the children as they marched to a large booth erected on the Company’s Paddock.  At about 4 p.m. the Lord Bishop accompanied by Rev. Reid arrived from Gum Creek.  After about 100 children had taken their refreshments some 200 adults enjoyed an excellent tea.  The Bishop distributed prizes.  While the actual number of pupils, at around 140, is not increasing, the Bishop was glad to note that attendance had been rising.  The day raised £24-2-6.
