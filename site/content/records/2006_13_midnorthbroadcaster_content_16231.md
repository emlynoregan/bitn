Pickett’s grave is rather speculative.  He died in November 1851 when the new cemetery might have been used.  There is a tradition that he is buried in the old cemetery, but no conclusive evidence.

The identification of grave sites at the old cemetery requires more work and it is only to be hoped that those enhanced in the recent work have been correctly identified and delineated. ]
