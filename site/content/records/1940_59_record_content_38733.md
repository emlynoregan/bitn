Burra Bowling Club has at last acquired a power roller.  After searching in vain for such for some time, Guy Dollman undertook to make one, but no angle iron was procurable.  Eventually an old windmill stand was procured along with motor cycle chains for the drive.  An Adelaide firm cut the required gears.  The new machine travels at walking pace and can travel backwards and forwards to produce well rolled greens for the coming season.
