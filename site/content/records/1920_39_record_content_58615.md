B. Howard Clark writes about the Travellers’ Aid Society, saying it was not founded by Miss C.E. Dixon alone, but by a group of women of whom she was one.  She has been secretary from the start and has borne the brunt of the work.  Through her discoveries of the ‘White Slave’ traffic in Adelaide and her representations on it, the women police force came into being.
