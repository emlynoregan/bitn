Booborowie Institute.  Final plans submitted by Mr E.J. Affolter for a kitchen etc. have now been accepted.  Plans for sanitary conveniences have been deferred.  The institute is now connected to ETSA power.  An offer of a billiard table from Mt Bryan Institute was declined for lack of players, space and finance.  Mrs Basil Billing has accepted the position as librarian.  The farm land was ready for seeding; a further harrowing not being deemed essential.  More stones have surfaced and another gang of stone-pickers was arranged.
