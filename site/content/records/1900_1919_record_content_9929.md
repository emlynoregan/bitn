The Fate of the Smith Children

As a footnote to the episode concerning Emmie Smith which resulted in W.J. Davey being sued for libel: only a couple of months later Mr Smith went to Snowtown to work leaving the girls behind.  Jane (18) was in charge of Emmie (15), Sarah (10), Ruby (7) and Violet (4), but she was unable to adequately fulfil her duties and the State Children’s Department intervened with the result that those under 18 were sent to the Industrial School, Edwardstown, until they reached that age.  The attitude of the paper is clear from the closing comment in the report: ‘they will be better off under the care of proper guardians than under the care of any almond-eyed individual’.
