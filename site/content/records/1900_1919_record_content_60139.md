Burra Hospital Board, meeting on Tuesday.

Dr Steele advised he would resume practice on 1 June.

The Board agreed to pay Matron £23-18-6, which had not been paid during her illness.

The Chief Secretary asked for suggestions to fill the five vacancies caused by resignations.

Mr Crewes said he had been given to understand a member of the Board had been going around trying to persuade people to allow themselves to be nominated, which was improper until the Board received the letter.

Mr Winnall took offence ‘if it refers to me’.

After a little fencing Mr Crewes said it was Mr Winnall.

The latter said it was common practice to sound out potential members and he had done so before the letter from the Chief Secretary had been written and had not tried to persuade anyone.

Mr Crewes then withdrew his remark in connection with the letter, since Mr Winnall assured the meeting he did not know about it, but not his remarks about interviewing residents.

Sister Carter, late of Wallaroo Hospital was appointed Matron and Miss Cain of Adelaide was appointed Charge-Nurse.
