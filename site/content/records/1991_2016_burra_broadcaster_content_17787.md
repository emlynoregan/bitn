Max Heinicke from the Riverland has been on the road with his camels, a dog and some chooks for almost a year, but now is heading back to his home between Swan Reach and Mannum for Christmas.  He has spent a few days with his camels and a canvas-covered wagon parked by the saleyards behind the Bon Accord Hotel.  Thym Bitter tried his hand at camel riding while they were there.  [Photo.]
