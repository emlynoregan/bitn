The Mayor said the matter had been dealt with at their last meeting and notices had been served.  To ensure a sound basis in case law another order had been prepared by the Central board of Health to be passed by this meeting.  This was then done.

Cr Rabbich then called attention to the press reports as mentioned in the third leader.  The Mayor in reply cited Mr Rabbichâ€™s statements, which deflated the Councillor.
