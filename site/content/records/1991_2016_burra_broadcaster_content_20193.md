David Messenger, who suffers from kidney failure, regularly uses a dialysis machine in his home in Essex Street.  He uses dialysis for three evenings a week for four hours at a time and this enables him to work and live a relatively normal life.  The house has had to be adapted and a special chair purchased.  Burra Medical Centre has volunteered to collect and receipt any donations people would care to make to assist in this cost.
