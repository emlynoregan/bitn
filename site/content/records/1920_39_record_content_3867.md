Visit of the SA Governor

Wednesday

The town was gaily decorated with bunting and flags.  People turned out in large numbers to greet the vice-regal visitors.  Mr Crewes (Mayor) met the official party at the station after which there was a civic reception at the Institute.  The entrance to the building was flanked by a guard of honour under Lieut. K.R. Crewes.  The Governor talked with the bandsmen and Pte Ralph Thomas on leaving the hall.  The Governor’s party had lunch in the vice-regal carriage at the station.  A public luncheon was provided in market square and the Burra Brass Band provided music.

The Governor laid the foundation stone at 3 p.m. after which the official party mingled with the crowd.  They then took afternoon tea in the marquee.  They then viewed the display of dahlias in the Record office windows and in R.D. Pascoe’s shop.  His Excellency then visited Mr R.D. Pascoe’s collection of stud sheep photographs.  In the evening a first class cinema program was screened.

Thursday

After staying overnight in the carriage at the station the Governor’s party visited Leighton, Booborowie and the country towards Mt Bryan.  His Excellency rode on horseback attended by Captain Boswell.  The others motored.  They paused at the Leighton School and having granted a half holiday proceeded to Melvin Collins’s Lamara Estate at Booborowie before returning to Burra for lunch.  At 2.30 they left to visit Mackerode where they had afternoon tea.
