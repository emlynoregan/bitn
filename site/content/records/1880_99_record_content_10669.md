Obituary & Inquest.  William Collins died on 15 September, at Wandillah.

An inquest was held.

Agnes Collins: - Everything was normal till 3 a.m. on Tuesday when she noticed the deceased was breathing heavily and when she lifted his head, he said, ‘What?’ and died within ten minutes.  She cannot explain the sudden death.

William Irwin saw the deceased at 8.30 p.m. and he then seemed quite well.  Heard Mrs Collins speak about 2 a.m. and afterwards she called out ‘Bill is dying.’  Tried unsuccessfully to wake him: he was drawing breath once a minute or so.  I went to get two mates, but he was dead on my return.

Dr Sangster performed a post mortem and found a greatly enlarged heart indicating a disease of long standing.  Verdict was death by disease of the heart.  [Death registered as 18 September, aged 30.]
