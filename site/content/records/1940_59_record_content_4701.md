The Drought Breaks

The past year has been exceptionally dry and in the pastoral country most of the properties received only three inches or less for 1940.  On Thursday 23 January there was a very lively thunderstorm, which brought the long desired rain.  In Burra 73 points fell in 35 minutes and by 9 a.m. Thursday morning the total had reached 120 points.

On Thursday afternoon another spectacular electrical display heralded a fall of 83 points in 35 minutes.  Drew’s Lane turned into a creek.  All the creeks from the surrounding hills ran abundantly, but the main creek carried it away without major flooding.

On Friday the rain set in solidly and in the town business was suspended as everyone stood around on verandahs to gaze and talk.  This time the water could not get away quickly enough and the creek near Dr Steven’s home overflowed, sending a great torrent down Commercial Street.  Market Square became a lake and the water spread along the side streets, only to meet the overflow from the same creek coming back to meet it.  Water tore through Lane Garden and almost entered the back of C.J. Pearce’s and Lee’s Motors.  The Queen Street Bridge was submerged, but survived.  The footbridge at the rear of the Commercial Hotel was swept away and Holder Garden was swamped.

In Market Square the water covered the footpath at Elder, Smith & Co.  Water entered Pearce’s Building, R.D. Pascoe’s and the Record Office, but in each case the damage was negligible.  The main creek was a magnificent sight, carrying a great deal of debris and we are told a few fowls met their Waterloo as the shed they were roosting on encountered the big bridge in Redruth.

Burra’s total rainfall was 318 points.

Burra North fared worse than Kooringa.

The area from the Bon Accord Hotel to the Racecourse became a lake and water entered a number of homes in the area.  At T. Villis’s the surrounding water was three feet deep, but only a little entered the house.  Sheds, however, were damaged, some poultry were washed away and we believe a cow was drowned.  The Vacuum Oil premises were invaded, but the stream just failed to reach the Bon Accord Hotel.  Luckily there was no sale at the stockyards where only the tops of the posts were visible.  The swing bridge at Gully’s Wharf was smashed by the force of the water and the Aberdeen Croquet green and gardens were completely submerged.  Mrs Moxham’s house on the bend was surrounded by water, which rose to the window ledges. Homes just above the Methodist Church at the foot of one of the steep hills were flooded.  A great view of the flood was possible from the hill at the rear of the Redruth Methodist Church.
