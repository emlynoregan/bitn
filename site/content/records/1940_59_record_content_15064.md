Booborowie Centenary.  [Continued from 63, 38, 21 Sep. 1943, page 3.]

Cr Fairchild was a foundation member of Council and gave sterling service.

By 1909 the rate had gradually risen from 6d in the £ to 8d.

Part of Canowie Estate was then subdivided and in 1910 the rate rose to 10d and the Clerk’s salary to £110 p.a.

I. June 1912 George Earle and J.W. Smart were elected for Anne Ward and H.A. Mayfield & D.E. Williams for Ayers.  W.S. Murray was elected Chairman.

There was agitation for a railway from Farrell’s Flat to Willalo Corner, but it was unsuccessful.

A petition on 7 June 1913 asked for the fencing of part of the north parklands for use as a recreation reserve.

Mr M.L. Fennessy was elected Councillor 4 July 1914 and in August a petition asked for a telephone line to be erected to Booborowie.

Cr Browne died in 1915 and was replaced by Cr R.E. Browne, his son.  A.D. MacDonald became Chairman on 2 July 1915.
