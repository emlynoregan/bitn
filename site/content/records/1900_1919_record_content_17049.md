Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co.  Water is flowing down the Burra Creek in a gentle stream from the mine pump.  The stream is small, but the pools are filled and footbridges (such as they are) are now used.  The flow extends to Princess Royal where it meets natural springs.  Children are having a great time paddling.
