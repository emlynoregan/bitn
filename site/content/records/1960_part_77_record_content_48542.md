Art Exhibition in RSL Hall

On Friday 5 & Saturday 6 December the group of artists who recently spent a week at Burra will display their works in the RSL Hall.  About 40 of their Burra paintings have been framed.  Some are members of the Citizens Art Group and others belong to the Royal SA Society of Arts.  Some works are oils and others are water colours.  Most are priced between $20 and $40.  20% of the profits will go to the Burra National Trust.
