Burra Town Council, 18 February.

Dr Sangster has refused in writing to act as Health Officer under the Local Board of Health.

The well at the cemetery has reached 34’ with hardly any water.

John Dunstan Jun. asked for a road to be opened on the east side of the creek for Redruth children to get to school.

[In 1928 there are references to Creek St, which seems otherwise unknown.  Could this be its origin?  The 1928 references would seem to indicate the site of the 2004 cycle and footpath.]

Cr Sampson gave fresh notice of his motion to change Ward boundaries.

The footway in Market Square is to be flagged where it has not been, opposite Messrs Lane’s and Geake’s.

Alfred Schutz granted a [cab] driver’s licence.
