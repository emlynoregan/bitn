The Inaugural Burra Biathlon was run in perfect weather, but with a disappointing turn-out.  Some 35 competitors cane from across the state.  Over 50% were from outside the district.  Narelle Schrader won the junior female short course.  Locals who did well: Adam Nicholls won the junior male short course and Bradley Wall won the mini short course.  [Other results for locals are printed, with three photos.]
