‘G’ writes re the Burra Waterworks, calling on the Council to urge the Government to commence work speedily because:

There are many men unemployed at present.

Money will be lost from the town by delay because when farming operations absorb local surplus labour soon outsiders will have to be brought in the do the work.

There will be no summer water supply unless work starts soon.

(The editor explains that the Council has been pressing the matter, but apparently it all awaits the engineer’s completion of the work he is currently doing at Mt Gambier.)
