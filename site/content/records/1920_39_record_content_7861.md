Burra Rifle Club.  15th consecutive AGM on 2 June 1922 was well attended.

The last year has not been particularly active.  An inability to buy rifles and new barrels was partly to blame.  Some members visited Clare, and Eudunda visited us and were defeated by a narrow 3 points.  The telephone between the butts and the hut is to be put in order.  Mr Maurice Collins has offered half the cost of jarrah posts needed and J.E. Pearce and Jack Kellock offered the rest.  A.B. Riggs donated the wire and insulators.  Targets and pits are in good working order.  Elected:

Captain		A.B. Riggs

Secretary	J.E. Pearce

Treasurer	W.R. Lee

At the match on Saturday best results were by V.A. Riggs, J. Kellock & H.L. Riggs.
