The Gaslight Restaurant

Bob and Jan Wright from Alice Springs were forced to extend their stay in Burra last January due to heavy rains in Central Australia.  As a result they saw the potential for the Market Square Café to be developed into a restaurant.  Since buying the place Bob has researched the building’s history.  He found that the building began its career in 1858 as the Gaslight Café and since then has experienced a chequered career with many changes of ownership.  To coincide with the opening of the rotunda in 1910 its name was changed to the Market Square Café.  In 1922 the Prime Minister Billy Hughes dined at the café before officially opening the Soldiers’ Memorial in Market Square.  Today under the name of ‘The Gaslight Restaurant’ it continues its century and a quarter career in the food retailing industry.  Today the atmosphere of the past is created by the use of the Victorian era furnishings and background music from a beautiful nickelodeon.  Meals are typical of the turn of the century.

[Mr Wright may have researched the café’s history, but we have been unable to find any corroborating references for the use of the name ‘Gaslight’.

The rotunda was opened in 1911.

If The Prime Minister dined there in 1922 there is no mention of it in newspaper reports of the time – or at least a Trove search failed to discover one.

In January 1923 Mr A.L. Bence had bought the store from Miss Snell and it became then a draper’s shop.

It certainly did not have a century and a quarter career in food retailing.

Miss Snell’s father had owned the building for many years.  He had a business there as a jeweller, later ran a Temperance Hotel in the building and later still operated a labour exchange from it and was described early in the 1900s as a stationer.

It would be nice to confirm the Gaslight story, even if the building’s continuity as a café is clearly an exaggeration.]
