Inquest on Redruth Post Office Fire.  Mr MacDermott SM conducted the inquest at the Redruth Court House on 2 March with Mr A. Stewart as foreman of the jury.  Mrs Davey, wife of Mr Martin Davey said she discovered the fire on Sunday 27 February at about 4 a.m.  In the house at the time these were beside the witness a servant girl Ellen Cushion, a young girl named Mary Jane Foy and a young boy named Samuel Cask.  The two girls and Mrs Davey slept in a bedroom next to the shop and the boy in a sitting room at the back of the store.  Martin Davey was very ill at Wallaroo; too ill to be informed of the disaster.  They had all gone to bed shortly before midnight.  They went to bed by candlelight, having placed the store lamps on the sitting room table and put them out.  No one in the house smoked.  The alarm was raised by Mary Foy who was disturbed by a sound she thought was thunder.  Ellen Cushion said no, it was fire.  The fire was then burning the door between the shop and the bedroom and the hangings of the bed were soon alight.  Very rapidly the fire spread to the deal ceiling aided by a strong east wind.  Ellen Cushion dragged Mrs Davey’s box out of the room as the witness ran to awaken the boy.  She then tried to save a harmonium but had to abandon it when it got stuck in matting in the doorway.  All the letters in the post office were lost, but a few unclaimed ones were saved from the back of the building.  Mr T.F. Scott managed to save then, the day book and ledger.

[Mrs Davey then gave evidence about the insurance cover and the stock that had been lost.]

Ellen Cushion gave corroborative evidence.  She had seen no one about outside when she had run out.  Other witnesses were examined at great length, but nothing further was elicited.  The stock had been insured for £500 and the building for £300.  The verdict was ‘That there is no evidence to show how the fire occurred.’  They added a rider ‘That the building where the Post-Office was kept was not suitable for the purpose on account of its inflammable nature.’
