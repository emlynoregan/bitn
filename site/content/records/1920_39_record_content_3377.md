Burra Town Council

W. Pearce has offered Council a good piece of malachite.

Cr Kellaway reported on tar-dressing as done at Peterborough.

Crs Treloar & Kellaway have inspected the Pig & Whistle crossing.  They suggest two rows of 2½ ft concrete piping be placed in the ford bed and that the floor then be raised to cover the pipes at an estimated cost of £55.

The garage for the ambulance is finished.
