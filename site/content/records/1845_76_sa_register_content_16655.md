Mintaro News, 8 June

The recent rains have enables most of the land around her to be placed under crop.  The road to Burra is next to impassable and to add to frustration, if farmers have to camp overnight due to the state of the road they are quite likely to find that any straying working cattle are impounded and they face a fine.  A meeting to address these grievances was held last Tuesday evening at the Devonshire Hotel.  A resolution was passed asking our members to get the impounding clauses of the Waste Lands Act repealed.  About 150 attended.

Sinclair the Wizard and Mr Johnson the violinist performed here last Wednesday evening.

A man named Jones, who has travelled these roads for the last twelve years, reports that he was robbed by a man near the Cross Roads Inn and a purse containing £4 was taken from him.  The victim’s hand was cut and other violence inflicted.
