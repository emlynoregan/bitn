A Primitive Methodist Chapel has been opened near the source of the Dirty Light, about nine miles south of Black Springs.  Services have been held near here for about two years in a cottage.  An acre of land was given by Mr Joseph Kinsey of Salisbury and building commenced.  On Sunday 1 August the building was opened with three services by Rev. H.B. Thomas in the morning and afternoon and Rev. J.G. Wright in the evening.  A tea meeting was held on Monday and the opening services brought in Â£77-1-0.  The stone building is in the Gothic style.  It is planned to start a day school as soon as a teacher can be found, as there is no school within six miles.
