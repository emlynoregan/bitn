Burra Cheer-up Society.

A social for two of our boys was attempted for Monday, but one had already been arranged for them at Aberdeen â€“ Ptes H. Fuss & C. Tiver.  [Presumably H. Fuss is Hasle Fuss.]

We have received a photo of Pte Harrop [Harrap].  On Friday we entertained some boys on leave at Violet Day tea in the tent. [Including Ptes S. Cordon & Dowd.]
