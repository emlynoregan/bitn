Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting, Monday with Mr Dane presiding.  Attendance was 20-30.

The Mayor, Mr Lane, commented on the difficulty last year in getting Councillors for East & West Wards.  He regretted the death in the year of the highly esteemed Cr Sampson.  Cr Lawn had taken over, but his business prevented him from seeking re-election.  The Mayor said the financial position was good despite rising costs.

Cr Radford said that cars were causing the road to the station to deteriorate and a special road for cars was needed, perhaps of concrete.

Cr Kellaway regretted the little work done in East Ward, but this was due to the legacy of the Cemetery Rd Bridge.  The money had, however, been well spent.

Councillors commented briefly on their wards – mainly re the need for money for roads.

Mr Foote thought North Ward would appreciate another lamp or two.

The Mayor elect, Mr Crewes, thought the town’s bridges needed paint and he hoped Burra would soon have a comprehensive corporation scheme for electric lights.

The Cemetery Rd Bridge had cost £390.
