Obituary.  Mr Richard D. Pascoe died on Saturday 12 January.

He was born in Burra 10 December seventy-nine years ago as the son of the late Mr & Mrs Joseph W. Pascoe.  He was educated at Burra School and then apprenticed as a barber to Mr Jimmy Doe* who is living in Adelaide.  At the age of 21 he opened his own business in the premises now occupied by Mr George Herbert.  He later occupied part of Messrs drew & Crewes’ premises.  In 1910 he purchased the premises now known as R.D. Pascoe & Sons.  He took a keen interest in the Burra Rifle and Coursing Clubs and also played cricket.  Outside Burra he was best known for his famous collection of stud sheep [photographs] bred in the district.  The walls of his shop are literally covered with a wonderful collection of these famous sheep [photographs] embracing all types from 1910 to now.  His collection of mineral specimens was also of interest.  In 1887 he married Miss Ellen Parks of Burra who died in 1910.  He is survived by two sons Messrs J.T. Pascoe (Burra) and Frank Pascoe (Adelaide) and two daughters Milly, Mrs Plane (Norwood) and Vera, Mrs Ockenden (Burra).  Miss ‘Sis’ Parks has lived with the family for very many years.

[Richard Delbridge Pascoe, born 10 October 1866 at Kooringa: died 12 January 1946 at Burra.

*James Edward Doe died 9 April 1948 aged 97.]
