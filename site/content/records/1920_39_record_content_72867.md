Burra Show was held last Saturday.  Attendance was high and quite as good as in 1937.

Sideshows did good business.

School entries were somewhat lower.

Art & photography were up.

Cooking entries were good and flowers were very pleasing.

There were only two entries in fresh fruit and none for dried.

Needlework was admirable.

Vegetables were affected by the long dry spell.

The lateness of the show reduced potential sheep numbers due to having to keep the sheep in wool so late.  [But actual numbers of entries were up as explained in the paper of 8 November page 1.]
