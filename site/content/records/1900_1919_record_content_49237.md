Leighton Public School Prize Day is reported from 21 December.  The head teacher, Mr H.O.J. Robinson, parents & friends assembled on 23 August to see the unveiling of three portraits and two flags. (HM the King, HM the Queen & Lord Kitchener and the Union Flag and the Australian Flag.)  They had been presented by I.J. Warnes.  At present there were 36 on the roll with an average attendance for 1916 of 27, which is good considering that 70% of the children travel over three miles.  The measles epidemic spoiled attendance figures for December with half the enrolment was away.  The prizes and awards are then listed.   Mrs Warnes presented the prizes for each grade.  Other prizes were presented by Mrs Wigley and the teacher.
