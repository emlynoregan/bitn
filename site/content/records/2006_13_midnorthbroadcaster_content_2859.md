Letter.  Martin Soltysiak of Peterborough writes protesting against the Peterborough DC’s plan to sell off the town’s railway assets and end the possibility of the wonderful heritage railway to Eurelia ever running again.  It is a huge blow to tourism and the region’s towns, when it could be developed rather than be lost.
