Saddleworth News, 26 October

Obituary/Inquest.  An inquest was held by Dr Ward JP on the body of John Clark last night.  Yesterday Clark, in the company of his friend and, I believe, partner, was engaged in cutting timber for the Burra Mine.  His wife was also present.  They were cutting a live tree from which some time ago a branch had fallen.  This branch was still attached to the tree, with the other end embedded in the ground and offering some support to the tree.  The tree fell as intended, but in doing so the dead branch turned around with great force and jammed Clark against the stump, killing him instantly, thrusting his head and chest against the stump.  He died instantly and his body presented a frightful appearance.  The skull was entirely laid open, the whole brain knocked out, an ear cut off and teeth knocked out.  The chest was also crushed and the body bruised all over.  The jury returned a verdict of accidental death.  The deceased leaves a wife and three children.

[John Clark died 26 October 1860 near Saddleworth aged 32.]
