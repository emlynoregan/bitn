Christmas Benevolence at Kooringa

Mr A. McCulloch of Princess Royal is in the habit of supplying those in want in the neighbourhood with the necessary rations for a Christmas feast.  This year the rations so distributed consisted of: a quarter of a sheep, 4 lb of bread, 12 lb of flour, 8 lb potatoes, 4 lb sugar, ½ lb tea, 2 lb currants, 1 lb raisins, ¼ lb lemon peel and 1 oz spice.  This was for a small family, with the quantities doubled for a large family.  The supplies were nicely parcelled and delivered before 7 o’clock on 24th December.  The persons and quantities were left to the discretion of several persons appointed by Mr McCulloch.  50 families benefited and 3,120 lbs of provisions were distributed.
