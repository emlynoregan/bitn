The New Church - St Mary's.

For some time it has been contemplated to supersede the old church which is falling into decay. The site was obtained in a commanding position between Kooringa and Aberdeen. Plans were prepared by Mr McLagan who has just carried out the Bank of Australasia. The contract was let to Sara & Dunstan for the sum of £2,800. The total cost with excavation etc. is estimated at £3,000. Over 300 people assembled on 3 July to see the laying of the memorial stone despite the poor state of the streets due to recent rain. At about 3.30 p.m. the Bishop and clergy headed by Mr Boult and three choristers came to the platform and Bishop Augustus Short, 1st  Bishop of the Diocese of SA, laid the stone in the 32nd year of his episcopate. The offering laid on the stone was £37-0-8. Rev. Henry Howitt spoke of the need for a new church, given the poor state of the old building. Tea followed and in the evening a concert which saw the hall uncomfortably crowded.
