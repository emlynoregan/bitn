Presentations were made last Monday evening at Miss Decima Warner’s Café to soldiers home on leave:

Cpl Stan Timms Jnr

Pte Jack Robins

Pte Hartley Aberg

Mayor T.H. Woollacott presided.  He commented that all were married men and commended each for joining up.  Pte Robins had shown he could take a reverse when last Saturday’s wind had taken the roof off his home at Burra North.  Pte Aberg had joined in February and left a wife and three children.  Cpl Timms had long experience with the Light Horse, the Militia and now the AIF.

A.B. Riggs said he knew Pte Robins well – especially when he took a job at Sara & Co. after leaving school.  Each man was presented with a wrist watch to be obtained from Wendt’s and to have it inscribed.  The committee had been unable to get them sent up in time for the social.
