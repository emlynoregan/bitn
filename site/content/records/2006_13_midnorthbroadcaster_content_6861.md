Burra Mine

Geoscientists from the Department of Primary Industries and Resources have revealed that the ancient volcano responsible for the Burra Mine copper mineralisation was active 797 million years ago.  This new data is part of a project funded by the State Governmentâ€™s Plan for Accelerating Exploration (PACE).  Mining company Phoenix, which is currently exploring in the area, is encouraged by the data.  They are currently evaluating data from a tenement recently acquired just south of the Burra Monster Mine.  [Aerial photo of the Monster Mine.]
