King Edward Fair was held at Burra Institute Friday & Saturday last.  Proceeds go to liquidate the debt on St Joseph’s.  Much of the success was due to Father O’Dowling who has taken charge since Father Reddan went away on account of ill health.  He has worked tirelessly despite travelling great distances to conduct services.  Proceeds £60.
