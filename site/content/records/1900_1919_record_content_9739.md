Redruth Court, 1 March.

Mary Ann Carpenter proceeded against her husband for assault at the Salvation Army Barracks on 21 February.  He had not knocked her down, but her ‘head was sore for several days’.  The court considered the case proved, but dismissed it as too trifling a character.  (J. Sampson & J. Winnall were the JPs.)
