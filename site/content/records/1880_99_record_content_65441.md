Numbering of issues in 1898.

Volume XV continued from its start on 7 December 1892 and ran for the whole of 1898.

The series began with Volume XV Number 299 on 5 January 1898.

and continued to

Volume XV Number 347 on 28 December 1898.

Numbering was reasonably coherent with only a few irregularities.  Since this series of numbers repeats from 1894, 1895 & 1896 in this sequence the number in round brackets indicates the number of times it was used in Volume XV to the 29 December 1897 and the number in square brackets indicates the times used in an earlier sequence and the year in which this occurred.

299 (2) [1, 1894]

300 (2) [1, 1894]

301 (2) [1, 1894]

302 (2) [1, 1894]

303 (2) [1, 1894]
