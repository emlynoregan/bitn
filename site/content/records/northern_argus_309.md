Burra Show.  After early drizzle the sun shone brightly for Burra’s 108th Show.

[This was not the 108th Burra Show.  The correct figure cannot be obtained by subtracting 1877 from the present year.  The first Show was held in 1877, but there were no shows from 1886 to 1893, apparently due to apathy, which provoked considerable comment in the local paper at the time.  The 1897 Show was cancelled due to the appallingly bad season and the 1914 Show was cancelled due to the combined effects of the outbreak of World War I and a devastating drought.  (The event returned in 1915.)  Twenty-five years of Shows from 1915-39 ended in 1940 when the Show was cancelled due to World War II.  The Show remained suspended until 1946, since when it has been an annual event.]

The Society’s President Jock Duncan was well pleased with the attendance.  John Olsen Leader of the Opposition officially opened the show.  This year some asphalt around the pavilions improved the area for visitors.  Cheree Deverson was Miss Mini Show Girl.  Sonya Fuller was winner in the Sub-Junior Section with Alison Reed in the Junior Section and Vanessa Pearce taking the Miss Show Girl title.  [Photo.]

Brophy’s Boxing Troupe was popular.

Jim Robinson won the shearing competition.

Phil Venning gave two blade shearing demonstrations.

The new inventions section was won by Melvyn Pearce with a sheep feeder.

[Results of various sections are then printed in c. 1¾ columns.]

The Burra Rural Youth disco in the Town Hall in the evening was successful.
