Kooringa News, 9 January

On Monday evening an entertainment was given at the Burra Hotel.  Proceedings began with a presentation of the burlesque Bombasto Furioso.  Afterwards there was a ball at which music was supplied by part of the Brunswick Band from Adelaide.

Some patriotic gentlemen in the district are attempting to establish a rifle corps here.

During the week the various denominations here have held daily and nightly prayer meetings in accordance with the suggestion of the Evangelical Alliance.  They have been pretty well attended.
