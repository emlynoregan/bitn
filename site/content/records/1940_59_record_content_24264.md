Weather.  More heavy rain fell in the agricultural areas in the 48 hours preceding 9 a.m. Monday.  Farmers were not keen to see this because of possible crop damage, but most seem to have come through OK.  Little fell to the East.  Burra 121 points, Booborowie 140, Hanson 162, The Gums 22, Koomooloo 25 and Old Koomooloo 3.

Burra has received 321 points for the month and the November record is 380 in 1905.  With ten days left in the month, the record could be broken.
