The Post Office. Postal services are not good enough. There is one delivery a day in Kooringa, but none in Redruth. The mail cart goes to the railway four times a day, but only takes mail to Redruth twice. Redruth should get mail to and fro whenever the mail cart goes to the station. Redruth and Aberdeen should have a delivery every afternoon and Kooringa a second delivery at c.9.00 a.m.
