Fire.  Messrs L.B. Rayner & Son of ‘The Bluff’ Hallett suffered a loss of c. $40,000 when 18 prize rams were destroyed by fire while en route to the Perth Show.  The rams were to be sent by rail from Port Pirie, but the truck caught fire between Gladstone and Crystal Brook at c. 11 a.m. yesterday.  The driver Mr Rob Burgess suffered shock and burns to his hands when he tried to save the rams.  Unfortunately those not killed in the fire had subsequently to be destroyed.  Damage to the truck was severe.
