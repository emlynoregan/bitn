Sheep Dog Trials were held 12 & 13 April and good entries were received with the local class being the neglected one.

The Governor had attended the show held on 4 & 5 October.  We wondered how the bad season would affect the show.  Day one was a good day, but on day two there was a dust storm most of the day and this had resulted in a loss on the show of £22-7-1, but we did pay out more in prizes that ever.  Patronage was good and all classes of entry except cattle were good.  In the year £68 was spent on improvements.  With the grounds now in order the committee do not consider a caretaker necessary.

Finance this year is not as satisfactory.  Last year a profit of £151 compared with a loss this year of £22.  This year the pictures showed a loss and the previously profitable Terowie train also made a loss.  The Adelaide train about broke even.  The General Committee has recommended for 1930 a one-day show at the later date of 22 October.  The catering by Mrs Rowe gave satisfaction to all.  All things considered: the depression, the drought and the bad weather on the show day, they had done well.

Mr Radford said he thought the loss on the dog trials of £20-14-3 did not take into account the number of members who joined only because of them.  He also thought it time depreciation on assets was taken into the accounts.  Some subscriptions and advertisements totalling c. £100 had not been paid for and when they came in the financial position would be better.

Mr Warnes said the balance sheet was to 31 December 1929 and a good deal of money had come in since and it was possible there would be no loss.  They would have to consider the cost of the Terowie train which had been affected by the growing use of motor cars and the cost of the band.

Elected: Patron, C. Bartholomaeus; President, I.J. Warnes; Vice-Presidents, M.A. Radford & S.H. Robinson.
