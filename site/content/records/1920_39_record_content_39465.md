‘Federation’ writes supporting ‘BOOB’ and urging farmers to unite.  He complains that letters from farmers to the Adelaide daily papers get so cut and mangled that the argument is unrecognisable – unless you are Messrs Alford, Cadd, Langsford and others whom he feels are not real farmers.

Unless the correspondent attacks the Government, abolition of tariffs, reduction in wages etc. his letter gets scant regard.  Better still panic the banks, Latham & Lyons & the Citizens League and his praises will be sung and his own troubles deleted.  It is said that not ⅛ of the wheat sacks required have been ordered, hence the reaction of the wheat buyers and commercial interests.  A year ago wheat farmers agitated for 3/- a bushel and looked like getting it when the ‘Freedom Association’ gave the Senate orders to throw out the proposal.  Everyone supplying farmers prices their product at cost of production plus profit etc. yet if a farmer wants the same hands go up in horror.  The present wheat crop in SA is worth £5,000,000 and yet after it is sold every farmer will be worse off than before.  Land values need to come down to the present productive value of wheat and wool.  Unfortunately the Advertiser is right in asserting that farmers will never unite sufficiently to prevent sufficient wheat coming forward to satisfy the state’s needs.
