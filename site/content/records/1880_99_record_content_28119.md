Advt.  Prospectus for the Burra Burra Manganese and Silver Mining Syndicate.

Capital of £3,400 on 340 shares of £10 each.  Situated 6 miles from Burra railway station.  [At Iron Mine]

The mine has already provided 10,000 tons of rich manganese ore used as a flux in the Burra Smelting Works.  [The hope of the syndicate was that the manganese was a cap to a silver deposit.]
