Burra Hospital.  Local residents continue to express concern over the provision of emergency services at the hospital despite assurances from Country Health SA that normal services are available, staffed by a General Practitioner from Clare.  Country health SA refuses to make any comment on the appeal by the local doctor against the decision barring her from attending emergencies at the Burra Hospital.
