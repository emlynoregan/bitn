Page 3.

Three or so large local advertisements.  Both here and on other pages the ‘news’ is mixed with other articles that are often war related.  They include actual stories from the war and propaganda against the Germans, Italians or Japanese, but also articles on war production, weapons, equipment and advice on what to do for greater car efficiency, use of gas producers, and on matters like air raid precautions and blackout requirements etc.
