Burra United Friendly Societies Annual Sports were held at Victoria Park on Boxing Day.  It was hot and muggy.  The procession did not occur due to the absence of society members.  The attendance was poor, but competition began at 11 a.m.  The pedestrian events went off well.  The bicycle track was in a bad state however, riders had to abandon the track in places and there were no less than eleven falls in the bicycle races: some of them serious.  The bicycle events are reported in some detail.

After the walking race Francis Joraslafsky, aged 3 got the idea of doing the same thing and took to the track.  The spectators were so amused they started throwing pennies at him which he readily responded to by collecting them.  He went once around the track in good heel and toe style.

The gate takings were only £27-4-9, compared with £43-7-6 in 1902.

The Burra Band attended and rendered selections of music.

In the evening the Gawler Dramatic Club produced Forgery at the Institute, to a good house.
