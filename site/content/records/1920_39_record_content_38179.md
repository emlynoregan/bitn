Mongolata Goldfield

Is the field going to be a big find or not?

If it were in WA there would be a rush, but perhaps it is just as well not to have a dud rush which would hurt many.  Still, surely some development of the finds already made is justified.  Present methods promise little but a living for a few hard toilers, but a start on modern lines might see Mongolata humming with activity.  Eventually that will happen if the gold is there, so why not now?  A battery could be picked up for a few hundred pounds and all the stone thoroughly tested.  Some ore found on Byles’ Claim last Saturday created excitement.  The latest find was by Messrs Ford Bros who are working with the Byles’ Syndicate.  The Byles’ Claim is rich in ore, but the lead is too narrow and the site of the main lode is unknown.  4 tons 15cwt from the narrow seam returned 32oz or almost 7oz to the ton; worth with the bonus £154.

Terry’s Claim produced 5oz 3dwt from two tons.

Messrs Hogan & Salter have made some good finds, but the ground is very hard and the reef c. 2ft wide and the gold-bearing stuff 18” wide.  Indications are good.
