Co-operative Bulk Handling Ltd says the Burra silo is at present empty and ready for the new seasonâ€™s intake.  It should be able to take all quota wheat.  Barley will be received on a through-put basis or at any time in bags.  The company seems likely to be able to take over quota wheat this season, BUT

Only when space is available in silos.

No farmer is to deliver more over quota wheat than 100% of the actual quota.

Total SA receivals of over-quota wheat do not exceed 50% of the state base quota.

These arrangements are not to be taken as a precedent for the 1971-72 season.
