Burra Town Council, 6 May

The Betting Control Board advised it would hold a public enquiry on the subject of providing betting facilities in Burra, at the Courthouse on 29 May.

Cr Jennison moved that Council state it was not favourably disposed to a betting shop being established in Burra.

The motion lapsed for want of a seconder.

Council will advise the Betting Control Board that it had received their letter.

Cr Jennison felt that the Council was shelving its responsibilities by not taking a prominent part in the matter.  The lack of a seconder suggested the Council was in favour of a betting shop, while he knew the majority of the people in the town were against it.

Cr Carpenter said he would be opposed provided illegal betting could be eliminated.

Cr Harvey said Cr Jennison has said that the people of Burra had placed them in the Council – but they had not – it was time the people of Burra took a more active interest in the affairs of the town.  The Betting Control Board had prevented a local poll to decide the matter so the BCB could stand on its own hind legs and he would have nothing to do with their enquiry.

Cr Harvey moved that the Corporation be not represented as a body at the enquiry.  Carried.

A Ratepayers’ Meeting of the Burra Town Council is called for 24 June to receive the Mayor’s Report and allow the four candidates for East Ward to air their views.
