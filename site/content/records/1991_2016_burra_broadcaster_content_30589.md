The Invasion of Iraq

Letter from Felicity Martin of Hallett attacking a speech by Hon. Alexander Downer of 17 February.  She points out the inconsistencies in his argument and highlights approximately 170 UN resolutions vetoed by the US, which would have ameliorated the tensions in the Middle East and internationally since 1972.

Editorial from Terry Wilson in which he considers it may have been better to opt for peace and worry more about situations closer to home.  New Zealand’s approach could teach us something.
