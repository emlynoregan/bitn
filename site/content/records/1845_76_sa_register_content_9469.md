Obituary/Inquest

An inquest was held before J.W. Macdonald Esq. on 22 October at the Burra Burra Hotel on the body of James White.

Isaac Holder: I saw deceased at 5.30 a.m. Saturday.  Have known him for about four years.  We shook hand and he asked for his ‘morning.’  I at first refused, but later gave him 6d.  He appeared sober and in good health.  He was sober when I saw him at 4 p.m.  He said he had been in a row.

Charles Laper, maker of lemonade and soda water for Mr Barker.  Deceased was well on the first night here, but a little tipsy on Saturday.  He was wrestling and dancing on Saturday night.  I recollect he had a quarrel with R. Roscrow, both being tipsy.  Heard him swearing.  A Spaniard went to him and shook him.  He then became quiet and went to sleep again.  The Spaniard called me in the morning and White was then dead.

[There was some evidence then of a fight on Friday night.]

William Brown said White was drunk when he came and appeared to have been so for some time.  After the first night he only had what he could beg from others.
