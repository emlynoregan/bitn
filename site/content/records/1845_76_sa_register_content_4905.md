Local Court, Kooringa, 13 August.

Owen Donahoo [sic] charged Jeremiah Hurley with assault.  Donahoo said that on Sunday evening the defendant and his wife brought a bottle of grog to his hut and when he refused to drink with them Hurley began beating him and threatened to stick a knife in him.  He had to send for the police because Hurley had taken over the hut.

Hurley said he had purchased the hut from the complainant for £4-10-0.

Alexander Daly gave evidence that he had seen Hurley pay £4-10-0 to Donahoo for the hut.  They had all been drinking together and Daley had seen no row.

Donahoo said loudly that Daly was perjuring himself and Donahoo had no money for food and could not have bought the hut.  The Donahoos had been living at the complainant’s expense.

Case adjourned for some better evidence to be collected.

14 August

John Grennin charged Benjamin Spargo with shooting a dog.  Grennin said the act was pure mischief and he valued the dog at £4.  Spargo said the dog, with others, had been chasing his cows.  His Worship said Grennin should have summoned the owner of the dog, but had no right to shoot it.  Spargo offered to pay £1 compensation for the dog and Grennin accepted the offer.  Spargo to pay costs of 16/-.

Adjourned case of Donahoo v. Hurley

Mary Locke gave evidence showing that the Hurleys had no money.

Edward Fitzgerald had heard Daly talking to Donahoo after the previous hearing.  He heard Daly say to Donahoo that the evidence he gave was not correct and that he knew nothing of the matter.

His Worship ruled that the case was evidently an attempt to do the complainant out of his hut.  Hurley was fined 5/- with costs of £1-12-0.

Alexander Daly pleaded guilty to assaulting Donahoo and was fined 5/- with 19/- costs.
