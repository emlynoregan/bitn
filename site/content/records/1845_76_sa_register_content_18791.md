Kooringa News, 20 July

There has been some good rain since my last letter and it reached as far north as Chewing’s.

Graziers complain that ewes and lambs are dying from the cold.

A meeting was held at the Burra Hotel last night to form a company to work the claim of W. Martin & J. Putt, taken out on Mr McCulloch’s Run about 75 miles from here.  The samples looked splendid.  A second meeting tonight will try to settle the matter.
