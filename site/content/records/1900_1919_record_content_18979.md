‘Working Man’ writes saying visitors to Burra have expressed amazement at stores keeping open till nearly midnight on Christmas Eve and others doing business on Christmas Day.  The excuse that it was to save the spoilage of fruit would be more believable if only that were being sold.  All stores should close at 9 p.m. or the Early Closing Act should be invoked.
