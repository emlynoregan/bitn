Characteristics of the 1884 paper.

The paper was published twice a week and included features that had previously been in the literary supplement.  Local news was probably as well covered as when there was a weekly publication, but was spread somewhat unevenly between the two issues for the week.  Some items seemed to be very brief this year: sometimes to the point of lacking clarity.  The absence of F.W. Holder due to his attendance at the Wesleyan General Australasian Conference in New Zealand led to the appointment of a temporary editor.  This person is not named, but evidence from the style and the public notice inserted on the departure from the town of Benjamin Franklin Langford suggests that he was the culprit.  His writings were prolix to the point of confusion and his purple prose on the issue of Chinese and coloured labour and/or immigration involves some amazing hyperbole in which his prejudice reaches hysterical heights.
