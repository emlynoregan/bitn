Editorial on the farcical Town Council meeting of 4 September which dragged on for an hour, apparently without transacting any business.  The Councillors squabbled about going into committee behind closed doors, but eventually the meeting was adjourned sine die.

The editor apologises for the report of the Council, but the readers deserve to know what happened.  At the previous meeting Cr Hardy moved the room be cleared.  This time Cr Parks moved the motion to reject ‘that awful recorder’. 

‘Councillor Parks had the audacity to say that the editor and three Councillors were working in conjunction with each other.  This remark is false and utterly without foundation.’

He stated ‘that the Council ought to adjourn and then broke off abruptly by saying, ‘but it is not safe to say to [sic] much.’

We regret that the Mayor does not try to work with all the Councillors.  At one stage the Mayor promised he would have to go to the extreme if Mr Davey [the editor] would not clear, but the extreme measures were not resorted to and after an hour’s talk the meeting was adjourned sine die.
