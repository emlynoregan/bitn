Adelaide to Darwin in 1924

Photographs of Essington Lewis on a journey to Darwin by car in 1924 have emerged recently from the Booborowie rubbish dump.  The photos and some other documents were handed to Meredith Satchell of the Burra History Group.  Meredith then set about finding out what she could of the journey.  Essington Lewis had two directors of BHP as companions; Harold Darling and Walter Duncan and a friend Robert Meares, who was later a director.  Even though the journey had been done before, it was still rare to see cars in Central Australia and supplies of petrol had to be sent on ahead.  For the journey two six cylinder Dort cars were prepared and modified to cope with rough roads and sandy patches.  The Burra History Group has organised a display in the Burra Town Hall of the photographs of the cars along with pictures of some of the homesteads on the route and of the terrain.
