Burra Waterworks Meeting, 29 November.

The Mayor, J. Sampson jun., presided at a meeting of ratepayers called to discuss the Waterworks.  About twenty were present at the start, but others drifted in later.

Cr Fuss said the Council had tried to get concessions from the government with respect to both the capital account and the interest rate, but with little success.  There was now only 5’ of water in the well and it was falling daily.  The plant required replacing, meters were required and would mean considerable outlay.  If the Government took over we would get a good supply of water and as for the fear it would be at a higher price he didn’t think so – we were already paying as high a rate as any district in SA.  He moved ‘That it is the opinion of this meeting that the waterworks be handed back to the Government’.  Cr Winnall 2nd.  He supported the above and said that the Council was a fluctuating body, lacking consistency in skills and ideas, and it also lacked capital.  He also complained about the Government’s attitude to the capital cost which was now as high as it had been 14 years ago.  Interest was higher than for any other SA town.

Mr J. Jenkins opposed the motion, moving as an amendment ‘That this meeting be adjourned to a day to be named by the new Mayor for further consideration of the matter.’

The chairman said he did not intend to put the motion so no amendment was necessary.

Cr Hardy spoke in support of returning the waterworks to the Government.
