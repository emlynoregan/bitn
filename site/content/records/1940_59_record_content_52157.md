Back to School at Burra drew about 150 visitors, mostly old scholars, to the school last Tuesday.  They were welcomed by Mr A.G. Heinrich, President of the Primary School Committee and Mr A.B. Riggs, President of the High School Council and they were addressed by the Mayor, Mr W. Carpenter.  Four of those present had been there at the opening of the school 74 years earlier: Mr & Mrs J.G. Sara, Mrs A. Carpenter and Mr W. Bland.

The celebrations were deemed a great success.
