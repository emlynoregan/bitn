Fire.  Following a burning off operation by the railway ganger that got out of control on 10 January a meeting was held by landowners at Hallett.  The meeting requested that all landowners be notified of burning off operations, that burning off be commenced as early is the season as possible and that farmers be allowed to plough breaks on railway land to add to their protection.  The Railway Commissioner Mr Fitch replied that landowners had been notified in writing of the intent to burn off.  Burning was done as soon as possible, but the ganger had a large area to cover and burning off could not be done when fewer than four men were present.  In the Burra District the burning is done as a joint operation and the railways would be happy to extend such co-operation to the Hallett area.
