Fires.  On Friday a fire burnt 50 acres of stubble on the property of Mr Ken Phillips of World’s End.  A number of sheep in the paddock were moved to safety.  In the clam conditions it is thought to have been slowly burning for about two hours before being noticed as about 3 a.m.

On Saturday it was discovered that a fire on the property of P.J. Thomas east of World’s End had burnt itself out in clam conditions.  Quite a lot of fencing was destroyed before the fire halted at a well-used track.  There is evidence that a person or persons were in the vicinity at the time.
