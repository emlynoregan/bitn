Red Cross Annual Report.

Mrs Harcus resigns as Honorary Secretary on account of her leaving the district.  There has been a great amount of sewing done to send away a large case of clothing each month.  Also they provided luncheon and afternoon tea on Australia Day and served over 1,000 people.  Cases of goods were sent to the League of Loyal Women and to nurses at the front.  A concert organised by Miss Kathleen Sandland raised £51 in September.  A Christmas tree was organised in December and raised £82.  Red Cross joined in Repatriation Day supplying luncheon and afternoon tea in Market Square.

The fete in June raised £215.  [Further detail fills c. 1½ columns.]
