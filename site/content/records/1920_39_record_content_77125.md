Weather.  Electrical storms prevailed since the last paper.  A particularly severe one was experienced on Wednesday last.  A thunder clap about 2 p.m. caused telephone bells to ring and put wireless sets out of action, particularly in Thames St.  Several residents reported seeing a huge fire ball.  Burra got 30 points by Thursday morning and to the east falls varied from 2 to 85 points, since when more storms have caused erratic falls over the whole area.
