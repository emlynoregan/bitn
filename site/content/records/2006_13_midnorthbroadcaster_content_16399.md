A Public Meeting was held at Burra Town Hall last Wednesday to discuss rates and representation.  Only a small number of ratepayers attended.  It was organised by the Ratepayers Action Group and chaired by the Member for Stuart Mr Dan van Holst Pellekaan.  RAG spokesperson Helen Szuty said although it was disappointing to see such a small turnout, it was more disappointing to see no Council members present.  Elected member, city of Burnside 2003-10, Jim Jacobsen was guest speaker and gave a clear overview of Councilâ€™s Rating Review Report.  Mr Jacobsen said there were clear communication issues between the Council and ratepayers.
