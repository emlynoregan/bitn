Burra Burra DC, 5 July

Rates were left unchanged from 1970-71.

Mr Roy Jeffery was elected Chairman for the ensuing year.

Burra Primary School Grade VI students visited the meeting.

Since 1965 plans have been drawn up and altered for a common effluent scheme, but so far no action has followed.  Now a new scheme of limited extent to be achieved at a reasonable cost has been designed to serve the most difficult areas and it is hoped this will receive ratepayer support.  Council also discussed vandalism at Redruth Gaol, noisy patrons at the Burra Pictures, pedestrians and school children not using the pedestrian crossing at the Town Hall and control of horehound in Burra.
