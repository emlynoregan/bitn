Editorial on Christmas

The pastoral and agricultural sectors are prosperous, but the town has no industry to fall back on and hopes of seeing the old mine re-started have entirely vanished.  The town has wealth it cannot touch due to the ‘conditions not at all complimentary to those responsible for the state of affairs’.  Yet we hope too for commercial prosperity.

There are also the usual Christmas greetings.
