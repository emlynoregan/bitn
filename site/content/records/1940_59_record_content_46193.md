A Ratepayers’ Meeting was held in the Burra Council Chamber on Wednesday.  Mr W. Nankivell, one of the candidates for Councillor, apologised for his absence.  He is in hospital.

The Mayor’s Report for 1949-50.

The Mayor announced that the Council had managed to balance its budget despite rising costs of materials and wages.  In 1947 there had been an overdraft of £621 and that had now been liquidated.    The Mayor reported a good year with no divisive arguments and open discussions on all topics.  The £621 overdraft had been reduced to £468 in 1948 and by June 1949 to £63.  In July last year the Council budgeted for rising costs of materials and wages, but then costs of both rose more rapidly than allowed for and produced an overdraft of £340-8-5, against which a conservative estimate of liquid assets was £160, giving a debtor balance this year of £18-8-5 [sic] or £97 more than last year, or £97 more than last year, which is not too bad.  [The £18-8-5 figure should read £180-8-5.]

But with £184 of outstanding rates to be collected, the debt is practically nil.

Council has found it more economical to buy crushed metal from the Ballast Quarry than to raise it and spread it itself.  With current costs the latter would work out at c. 30/- per yard compared with 11/1 per yard spread.  £150 worth of gravel is in storage.

Council has purchased the old Mine skimp dump with sole right of access, on a pay-as-you-go plan.  Council assisted with the erection of two new tennis courts at Burra North.  Last year’s plan of planting trees, selected by ratepayers, in the streets adjacent to their houses, provided the ratepayers agreed to look after them, has worked well and is being continued this year.  The Market Square garden is flourishing.  There was no convenient public phone booth in Burra and at the Council’s request a multi-coin machine was installed in Market Square last year and three letter boxes were also installed.

A Civic Reception was extended to Sir Charles McCann, the SA Agent-General in London, and to Dr Hargadene (Dr of Veterinary Science from Holland.)  A Civic Farewell was given for T.H. Woollacott and a suitable presentation was made in recognition of his long term as Mayor.  The Mayoress attended numerous functions in the district and opened many of them.

Health

After years of complaint, the sewage problems behind the Burra Hotel should be solved with plans now in hand by the owners.  Both public conveniences have been repaired.  New conveniences are under construction at the school after pressure was brought to bear on the authorities.  The cemetery is in reasonable condition.

The Mayor extended thanks to his wife, the CWA (for help in Town Hall matters,) to the Town Clerk and to the Overseer and other Council workers.

Candidates for 1950-51.

R.C. Lott (East Ward Extraordinary Vacancy) said he had served on Council before and would work for the best interests of his ward and for the town in general.

M.F. Pritchard (East Ward Extraordinary Vacancy) made similar expressions of intent and said he realised that rising costs would require close attention to details.

H.C. Davies (West Ward) said he had no previous experience in Council, but was sure the town would go forward.  ‘Thought the Town Hall debt should be reduced and everything done to improve the hospital.’

H.M. Scott (West Ward) thought a Progress Assoc. should be formed, where matters could be thrashed out and concrete proposals put to Council.

R.G. Bernhardt (Extraordinary Vacancy West Ward) said this was his first attempt to be elected and he would do his best for his ward and the town.

Mr Carpenter, the incoming Mayor, agreed with the usefulness of a Progress Assoc. or a Ratepayers’ Assoc.  He was proud to be the Mayor as a native born Burra boy.  The Town Hall needed attention and he would support efforts to reduce its debt.
