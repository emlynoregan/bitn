John Tennant of Princess Royal complains that the road into Burra past Mr William Finch’s and the cemetery is absolutely dangerous.  The problem is that although he pays the District Council about £100 in rates, he is almost the only user of this section of road within the Town Council area and he pays that Council about 9/- p.a.  The town Council has spent much already on a culvert.

[The paper considers the DC should offer to pay for repairs as the fairest thing to both the town and Mr Tennant.]
