Burra Cemetery.  The ‘Chinese’ and the ‘Murder’ headstones have been repaired.  The Chinese headstone was in small pieces and had to be assembled like a jigsaw puzzle and the Murder headstone needed some lettering re-chipped.  Pearse Monumental Masons of Clare did the work.  Some headstones have been replaced [from those along the wall] and where positions were not known (because some records have been lost) they have been placed in the area cleared in the 1960s.

Kooringa Masonic Lodge has assisted in repositioning a stone which had been erected by them in 1878.  Headstones in the cemetery testify to the many different countries from which early resident came.
