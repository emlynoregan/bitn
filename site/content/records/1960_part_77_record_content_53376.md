Burra Mine.

Blasting operations will commence in the next fortnight.  It is vital that no one except authorised persons enter the quarry through any other entrance than Linkson Street.  The area is being fully fenced.  No one is admitted to the site without a pass from the office of O’Connor & Son in Linkson Street.

The Bon Accord pipeline, a six inch main from the old mine shaft to the Processing Plant is three quarters completed.  All sewerage services for the administration and plant area have been laid.  Storm water service for the area is nearing completion.  Work has started of the primary crusher footings and the leach tank footings.  The 1.5 million gallon reclaim dam has been started.  It will reclaim all used water on the site for re-use.  The ‘Fines’ dam of 110,000 cubic yards has been completed.  The fines will be processed later in stage 2 of the project.  ETSA supply to the site should be completed by the end of this week.  Fencing is ahead of schedule and should allow tourist facilities to be provided near the E & WS water tank for the show weekend.  At present about 80 men are employed and this should rise to about 250 by mid-November.
