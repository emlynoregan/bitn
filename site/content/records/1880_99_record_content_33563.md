Editorial on The Town Assessment.

It has been decided to revise the assessment rather than make a new one and the writer agrees with this as a new one may be necessitated when the new Municipal Corporations Act, now before Parliament, is passed allowing for rates to be based on unimproved land values - a system which the writer saw as much fairer.  They have also decided to add to tax paying properties those of the private residences of Government employees - a move endorsed by the writer.
