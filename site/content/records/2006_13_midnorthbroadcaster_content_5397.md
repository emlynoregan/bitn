Burra Hospital

Shadow Minister for Health, Vicki Chapman, says she has been informed that the Rann Labor Government wants to close 25 country hospitals following the abolition of Country Hospital Boards, effective 10 April 2008.  The plan would convert the closed hospitals to aged care facilities and see the development of four regional hospitals at Mt Gambier, Berri, Whyalla and Pt Lincoln.  Local residents are concerned at this threatened loss.  So far no one from the Government has responded to enquiries from the Mid North Broadcaster on this situation.  Health care in the country is already a concern with many obstetrician services closed and any plans to close acute and emergency care services must be made public said Ms Chapman.
