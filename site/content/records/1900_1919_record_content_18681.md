James Tiver was presented with a framed address in recognition of past services at Redruth Methodist Sunday School last Sunday afternoon.  Age has caused him to retire as superintendent, a position he has filled from time to time over the last 40 years.  [He was 77.]  H. Preece takes over that role.
