Ratepayers’ Meeting, 21 November at the Institute with M.A. Radford in the chair.

Cr Collins was in Adelaide and apologised.  Cr Harris was unwell.

The Chair congratulated the Mayor on winning the seat at the Federal election – though as a representative of the Liberal Federation he had tried to defeat Mr Collins.

The Mayor read his report and congratulated the Fire Brigade at their recent successful effort at the fire at Mr Lewis’s shop.

He refuted allegations in a letter sent to the Fire Brigade Board that they were not doing their job.  In his six years as Mayor the most significant events had been:

The opening of the new Showgrounds.

The Back to Burra Festival.

Visits of the Governor-General & Lady Stonehaven and of the State Governors Sir Tom & Lady Bridges and Sir Henry & Lady Weigall.

The visits of the Prime Minister Rt Hon. S.M. Bruce, the Federal Treasurer Dr Earle Page,  the Bishop of Adelaide, the Premier of SA Hon. L. Hill & the Bishop of Pt Augusta.

The erection of some £50,000 worth of new housing.

The opening of Children’s Playgrounds at Aberdeen & Kooringa.

The great increase of tarred road from a quarter of a mile to several miles.

Mr Treloar seconded the adoption of the report and especially thanked Mrs Collins for her work over the years.

Election speeches of candidates followed.

Cr Riggs outlined his experience as a Councillor for six years.  He thought asphalt and spremax were likely to prove superior to tar and thought a crusher for metal would be needed and would save money in upkeep sufficient to pay for the £45-£300 outlay.  Bridges he felt should come from general funds and not ward funds.  The Council presently had three horses (two past their prime).  He felt the rate would have to stay at 2/6. He favoured each ward getting £300 as this year rather than the 75% of rates collected in it.  As Mayor he would have the whole town’s interests at heart.

Mr Kellaway said he had been a Councillor for eight years and had experience as chair of all committees.  He felt many old trees should be replanted with ornamental ones.  He favoured the use of spremax on roads, but gravel for footpaths.

Mr Morton favoured solid work on roads that would last, but he is not reported on other matters of policy.

Mr Morgan thought too much was spent on roads and side streets needed attention.

Mr Wicklein asked about tarring Market Square.  Mr Kellaway was for it and Mr Morgan would wait to see the finances.  Cr Woollacott said it had been delayed by the monument scheme which was still undecided.  Crs Pearce and Riggs felt that finances were against it.

On the question of unclaimed allotments the Mayor said the cost of getting title was more than the value of the land.

There was a question about a water cart for Fridays especially, but the consensus was against it.
