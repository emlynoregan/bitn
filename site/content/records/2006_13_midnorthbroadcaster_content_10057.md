Lisa Smedley also writes to express her outrage at the decision on the Burra Hospital emergency service.  Clare doctors are already fully extended coping with local demand there.  It can take days to get to see a doctor in Clare.  There is also a domino effect.  What doctor would want to practice in Burra without hospital privileges?  How long will the town have a pharmacist if there is no local doctor and hospital?  This decision could have a huge effect throughout the town and community, with the loss of many associated jobs and knock-on effects socially and economically.  People have been comfortable moving to the town because it had a doctor, hospital and pharmacy.  An extra half an hour in an emergency before you get a medical decision from someone could mean your life.
