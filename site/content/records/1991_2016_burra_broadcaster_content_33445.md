Burra North Railway Bridge.  Transport SA has applied to the State Development Assessment Commission to demolish the railway bridge over the highway at Burra North along with part of the embankment.  Goyder Council supports the removal.  Numerous accidents have been recorded there over the years.  The railway line has not been used since 1991.  The last passenger train was a special Bluebird railcar used for a school trip from Hallett and Mt Bryan to a function in Burra.  [Photo]
