Burra State School speech Day and Prize Distribution was held on Thursday 17 December at the Institute.  Mr Johnson, head teacher, reported there were 119 boys and 126 girls on the roll.  Only 4 got through the examination to enter High School, though he had expected about 20 to do so.

The Institute was awarding 12 annual memberships to students.

Mrs Crewes was ill and unable to present the prizes.  In awarding the Mayor’s medal for dux they had considered three candidates.  Dorothy Pederson and Mary West each secured 85 points, but had been two years in the school.  Fred Scholz had gained 83% in one year and contended with travelling about 10 miles to school, so the medal went to him.

Rev. Durnford’s prize for the best essay on Burra and District attracted 26 competitors and seven were tied for 1st place: Jean Litchfield, Josephine West, Vernon Fuss, Dorothy Bartholomæus and Hedley Pearce.

The prizes were distributed by Mrs J. McLaren.

The prize list is printed and extends to page 3.
