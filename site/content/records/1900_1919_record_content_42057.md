Sergeant Wheatley writes from Mena, Egypt, dated 8 Feb. 1915.  They expected to be involved in the fighting along the Suez Canal, but so far had not moved.  At Sunday church parade Wheatley conducted the massed bands.  Afterwards he and several other sergeants dined with a local sheik (Head of a Village).  They rode donkeys to a house about 2 miles away.  They dined in a large room with a long table and were waited on by servants in long brightly coloured silk robes.  They were served a dish of quail, then turkey, rice rolled in lettuce leaves, then skinless sausages.  They were then almost full, having had whisky and cigarettes between dishes.  The meal ended with stewed fruits and nuts and a big dish of something with nuts floating in it.  The host did not eat with them, but afterwards.
