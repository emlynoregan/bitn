Obituary.  Leonard Melrose Schmidt, second son of Hedwig Wilhelmina Schmidt (nee Bruhn) and her late husband Johannes F.C. Schmidt, was born at Robertstown 10 October 1942.  He lived in the Emu Downs district all his life and followed farming pursuits.  He was a constant member of the Emu Downs Lutheran Church, which he served as a lay reader for 18 years.  In November 1950 he married Elizabeth Joyce Werner.  The deceased enjoyed average good health and his death was unexpected.  On Saturday 12 March he was standing on the local tennis court, apparently enjoying good health and in good spirits, when he suffered a coronary occlusion, collapsed and died in a moment aged 37 years and 5 months.  He leaves his wife Betty and three young children: Christine, Jeffery and Wayne.  He is also survived by his mother, one brother and three sisters and their families.
