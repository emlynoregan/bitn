Dalgety’s Wool Muster

Speakers painted a picture of hard work ahead for the wool industry, but saw new markets and possibilities in the future.  It was expected that [live sheep exports] to Saudi Arabia could rise to 500,000 p.a. and prices of young sheep could rise by up to $5 per head.  Indonesia could perhaps take 30,000 in the next year.  Rex Glennon said it was important buyers not find ‘extras’ in bales of wool purchased: we cannot afford to fill our bales with twine, dirt, seeds and bottles.  China and the CIS will be major marketing areas for the next few years.  Western Europe remains the largest customer – though often wool gets there via an in-between country.
