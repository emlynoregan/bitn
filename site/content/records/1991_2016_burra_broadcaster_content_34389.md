Letter.  Reece & Pat Van Gasteren write dismissing the exaggerated fears and complaints of Des. Woolley with respect to the threat to the Ayers St culvert and road posed by the Princess Royal traffic.  As for the trucks themselves:

‘We observed the live-stock trucks of Ayers St and Quarry St last week.  They were driven slowly, giving care and respect to the town.  Thank you to the drivers.’

They suggest that anyone who does not like industry in the town should consult a real estate agent.
