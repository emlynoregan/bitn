Editorial on ‘The Copper Market’

Despite news in the last two mails of a slight depression in the copper price there can be little reason to fear a serious decline in the value of the metal.  Authorities consider a rise likely.  The demand is rising and stocks are falling and so is production.  Copper is now widely employed for many new manufacturing purposes and also more extensively in some older branches of industry.  The introduction of the breech-loading gun has seen its use rise dramatically.  In Europe alone 15,000 to 20,000 tons annually is used in making cartridges.  Railways are large users and the extension of submarine telegraph communication has increased demand.  Production in England has fallen from 24,257 tons in 1856 to 6,500 tons in 1871.  Production in Chile fell from 54,867 tons in 1869 to about 41,000 in 1871.  Copper stocks have as a result fallen.  Demand is increasing in India.  [The article gives data of stocks held in various places and at various times.]

It is therefore more than probable that the maximum price has yet to be reached, despite the present small fall.

[The writer than considers past movements in copper prices before summing up on a positive, if cautious note suggesting at least the maintenance of present prices and perhaps an increase.]
