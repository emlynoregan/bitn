Kooringa News, 12 September

On Sunday a smart thunderstorm dropped a heavy fall of rain on Kooringa and hail of quite large size on the Mt Bryan Hills.

Rev. W. Taylor preached three sermons on Sunday at the Kooringa Wesleyan Chapel.

On Friday a number of shareholders returned from a visit to the Nackara Mine, bringing samples and glowing reports.  The men have sunk the shaft to 35 feet and the lode at that depth is 2 feet wide.  Samples from it have been variously assayed at 52½%, 33% and 12% copper.  The price of the shares has risen and now cannot be readily had for less than £60.

Other mines in the area are pushing ahead too.  Hallett’s Hill added four more miners this week and there are rumours of other discoveries.

There is still no sign of money being spent on the road through the Sod Hut Ranges, which remains in an awful state.
