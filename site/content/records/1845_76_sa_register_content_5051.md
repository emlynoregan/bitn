Operations at Burra Burra began on 29 September 1845 with a paid up capital of £12,320 and although £10,257-6-2 was expended in purchasing the inestimable territory known as the Burra Burra, the mining operations were so successful that it has not been necessary to make any subsequent call.  The distance of the European markets has proved to be no financial hindrance where products were so rich and remunerative.

The prospects encouraged the Directors to make a liberal and unsparing expenditure: nevertheless the returns were ample and on 24 June 1847 they were able to pay a dividend of 50% for the one and three-quarter years since first breaking ground.  Since then they have paid dividends amounting to £221,760 without any visible impoverishment of their resources.  On the contrary, their productive capabilities are richer than ever and there seems to be no fear of any discontinuance of their quarterly dividend of 200%.

In the five years to 30 September last they have raised more than 56,428 tons, of which 18,692 were raised in the last twelve months.  On the 30 September last there were employed:
