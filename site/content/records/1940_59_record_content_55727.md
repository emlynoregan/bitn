Road to re-open.  The Highways & Local Government Department has decided to connect rhe new Main Road 46 with Burra by re-opening the road between sections 2264 and 2263, which was closed 8 April 1880.  The Town Council will have to purchase a portion of Mr Lommanâ€™s land and fence the new road.  It is thought this move is in preparation for the bitumen road some day.
