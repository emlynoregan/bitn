Burra Creek Update

The Council has been trimming and tidying under established trees, revealing some pleasant views â€“ notably the western bank north of the motel and the area immediately north of the Pig and Whistle Ford.

Discussions concerning a Community Nursery are ongoing.

The Cox Mower that the Council bought for our use has been very useful, though some areas are too rough for its use.

Seedlings have been planted in Mitchell Flat and Taylor Street areas.  Some areas of Convolvulus infestation are a problem and in the Taylor Street area, silver leaf nightshade is a pest weed.
