The Burra Pre-Kindergarten School [Sic in the headline: instead of Pre-School Kindergarten.]

An enthusiastic meeting held on 5 March decided on this project, but it has now lapsed.  At a meeting called in the Council Chambers on 26 August only one person in addition to the committee attended.  The choice was either to re-organise the committee or wind up the project.  Rev. M.P. Cowle, as Chairman of the Committee, said there was too little public support and he favoured discarding the whole idea.  Hon. Secretary C.J. Fuller said £20-17-6 had been collected and yearly expenses would be about £200 plus the purchase of equipment and this lack of support and non-attendance at the meeting indicated people were not interested.  His view was echoed by Rev. A.S. Barrett and Mesdames Woodards and A.B. Riggs.  The project was then wound up.
