The Police Community Consultative Committee [PCCC]

Chief Inspector Jim Langmead discussed the possibility of a PCCC with a group at Burra Activities Centre on 29 June.  It would be the first such committee in SA.  It had been thought that the first committee would be at Pt Pirie, but the troubles experienced in Burra had prompted it as a better choice.  The complaints from the original public meeting had been followed up and resolved in an informal manner.  A community survey is planned and Burra will provide a benchmark with 1,200 being included in the survey.

Some disquiet was expressed because the group elected at the public meeting had never issued a final report and some of them had not been informed that the group was being disbanded and a PCCC possibly formed.  Inspector Langmead has agreed to set a date for the final meeting of that group, probably in late August, and then to write an open letter to the media.  He also confirmed that Burra is officially still a three person station, though it only had two officers at present.  Staffing is being reviewed across the state.  He thought it was now time to close the issue and move on and the PCCC was a way to do that.
