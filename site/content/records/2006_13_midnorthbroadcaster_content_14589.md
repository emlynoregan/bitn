Eichler family Reunion.  Descendants of Carl Eichler recently gathered at the Burra Cemetery for the dedication of a memorial stone where he was buried on 14 April 1889.  Pastor Graham Simmonds conducted the service.  The family then visited a number of sites in the town associated with their ancestors and then met at the Burra Hotel for dinner, which was also attended by members of the Burra History Group.  On Sunday there were visits to other sites of Burra’s heritage and a service at St John’s Lutheran Church.  Carl Eichler and his wife Henriette with six children arrived in Burra in 1851 from Clausthal in Germany.  Carl had been a miner all his life and the couple were both aged 40 when they migrated.  Their eldest child, August, turned 15 soon after they arrived.  Carl soon joined the gold rush to Victoria, but after three years returned to Burra to be employed at the Mine as a timberman.  He stayed until the Mine closed in 1877.  They owned properties in Illogan Street, and in Millerton.  All the children survived to adulthood and their descendants are now scattered across Australia and New Zealand.  Carl died 12 April 1889 aged 78 and Henriette on the same day 11 years later in 1900 aged 88.
