title: E. White writes a fascinating if bizarre letter to account for depressions
  and their associated rain that can be drought breaking.  He invokes the production
  of ammonia from decaying animal carcases which being light creates a low pressure
  and drags in the monsoons from the northwest.  When the air contains gas the heat
  intensifies and maintains the thunderstorms till the ground is saturated.  Wheat
  farmers who sell the wheat and burn the stubble deprive the soil of nutrients and
  the air of ammonia from decomposition.
