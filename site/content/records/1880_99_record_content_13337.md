Editorial on the new Parliamentary Session and the need to act on the land question and on taxation policy.  The liquor laws also need reform.

2nd Leader on the present condition of the labour market.  The writer is against the cessation of public works.  The cost of administration has been rising and the amount for works has been falling.  Road Boards have been starved of funds.  He is for immigration, which he believes stimulates demand.

Unemployed men are being sent to the drainage works in the South-East and others to water conservation works at Ardrossan.  We hope work will soon start on the Burra Waterworks.
