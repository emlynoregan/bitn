Anthony Thorogood has just returned after six weeks in England, Spain, France, Germany and the USA, sampling their ciders and researching their various cider-making techniques.  He also visited cider festivals.  He was funded by a Churchill Fellowship.  He found ciders quite different in each country.  German cider was sour, French very Sweet, American hugely alcoholic and the best outside of Burra was in Somerset.  He said unlike wine, it was best tasted in quantity with food.  Mr Thorogood has produced a book on cider traditions, for which he is currently seeking a publisher.  [Photo.]
