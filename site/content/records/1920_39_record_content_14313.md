Burra Show was held on 22 October.  It was the first show on the new grounds and was a resounding success.  Mr Winnall and Mr C. Bartholomæus, though now living in Adelaide, were back to take an active part.  The Bishop of Adelaide was a guest of the committee.  At least 500 sat in comfort around the ring.  It cost Mr A. J. McBride £350-£400 to prepare the ring.  President I. J. Warnes and Mr Bartholomæus gave the land, valued at £600.  John Melrose gave over £200 to see the buildings shifted.  The fence syndicate put up about £450 for the fence.  The society has an overdraft of about £400 due to the improvements.  (The floor in the luncheon pavilion cost about £100.)  One problem was pilfering of the exhibits which will need attention.  Henry Collins, aged 91, had sheep in this show and in the first show.  Mr Samuel Baker of Redruth, aged 85, was also active in promoting the first show and Mr A. Lott also recalled his entry in the first show.  A film and dance was held in the evening.

[This was advertised as the Jubilee Show, but why seems unclear.  ‘Jubilee’ usually implies the fiftieth anniversary – though other periods are possible.  The first show was in 1877 and there was a hiatus of 8 years from 1886-93.  Perhaps the alternative meaning of a season of great rejoicing covers this event.]
