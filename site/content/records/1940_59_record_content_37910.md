A New Town Assessment will be made following the Council’s acceptance of the Town Clerk’s price for the undertaking.  In 1900 the assessment was £8,512 and in 1924 it was £16,000.  It peaked at £17,000 in 1930, but in 1932 was reduced to £14,524 and has not been raised since.  It is presently £14,078.  A new assessment will be fairer for all.  At Present people who purchased places recently have their properties assessed in full and pay a high rate.  Those who bought in the past at a low figure are paying high rates, but on a low assessment.  The Clerk expects it to take four or five months to do the job.
