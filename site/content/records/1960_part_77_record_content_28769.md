Burra 100 Years Ago.  (Continued from last week.)

Redruth or Aberdeen is a small mining township in the Hundred of Kooringa.  It adjoins the Burra Mine on the eastern side of Burra Creek.  On the western side is a small township called Aberdeen.

[This messy description is in the original.]

The two are united by an excellent stone bridge with one arch and a span of 60 feet.

[This is incorrect: while there were probably stone abutments, the bridge was of timber and by 1879 the decay of the wood caused its replacement with a steel structure.]

The towns are supplies with water from wells about 30 feet deep on the surrounding hills.  Redruth is chiefly occupied by miners from the Burra Mine and smelters from the Kooringa Smelting Works.  There is a mine, the Bon Accord, not now working, adjoining the Burra Mine, and although large sums have been spent no copper has been found over the Burra Burra Mine boundary, though within a few yards of that boundary some of the richest ore raised ahs been discovered.

Communication with Hampton (½ mile), Kooringa (1 mile) and Copperhouse (1½ miles) in by rough bush roads and with Adelaide by four-wheeled coach via Kapunda and thence by rail.  There is one hospital for miners’ use only, supported by the mine.

Hotels are in Redruth, the Bushman’s Home and the Court House and in Aberdeen, the Smelters’ Home and the White Hart, recently transferred from Copperhouse.

[This ‘transfer’ has no support elsewhere.  The archaeological survey when the Ludgvan Street deviation was put in during the late 1980s reported the following points about the White Hart:

Allotments 147 & 148 of Aberdeen were sold September 1849 from Morehead & Young to William Spargo for £20.

Spargo erected a dwelling house and brewery.

13 March 1851 Spargo sold the site to John Magor for £200.  The conveyance is dated 16 July 1852.  The issue of a liquor license [in 1852] suggests the White Hart was constructed by then.

The report then traces the ownership of the property and of the licence to its demise as a hotel.  Mrs Mary Mowatt was the last licensee.

She surrendered the licence in 1892, but apparently left in 1888 to run the Old Lion in North Adelaide.

The owner in 1888 was Mrs Mary Ann Reed who died in 1889 and the property then vested in her son Richard Reed.

An advertisement in the ‘Burra Record’ 18 November 1887 says it is being conducted as a Temperance Hotel, suggesting that Mrs Mowatt had left by then and the hotel licence was no longer active.

References to its operation as a temperance hotel continue through to at least 1894.

The same paper records the destruction of the building by fire 14 March 1916, when it is said to be owned by James Reed and to have then been used as the home of Mrs A. Sara and also in part to have housed the Boy Scouts.  James Reed was a son of Richard Reed.

Mrs A. Sara (1859-1931) was the widow of George Sara (1839-1903) and a sister to James Reed.]

There are more hotels in these towns than in Kooringa because there the land is on leasehold from the mining company and the landlord will not allow more than three hotels.  In Redruth and Aberdeen they are built on freehold land.

The surrounding country is undulating and hilly.  All timber within 20 miles has been cut and used on the mine.  Not a tree can be seen within five miles and beyond that only on long purchased property.

Redruth contains a commodious court house, a well-built gaol (the furthest north) capable of accommodating 30 prisoners, and a police station.  It also contains a Wesleyan, a German Lutheran and a Primitive Methodist Chapel.  There is a private licensed school of nearly 100 scholars.
