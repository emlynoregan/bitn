Burra Hospital Board meeting of 24 August

The move of Mr I.J. Warnes to cut the Board from 12 to 7 members had to be deferred for consideration, as it would cut out those directly elected by the public.

The competition of private providers in the town meant that the maternity wing had so far had only two births.  Part of the problem was its cost which was for the ward 7/- a day prior to birth and £3-5-0 a week after.  Private rooms were 10/- a day and £4-4-0 a week after birth.  The wing needed to become established and Mr M. Collins suggested that for 12 months fees should be 15/- a week for the ward and £1 a week for the private rooms.  Mr Warnes seconded this.

Mr Davey said he did not believe it would ever pay its way.

Mr Riggs felt it was not the fees that were keeping people away.

Mr Melrose thought the waiting fees a little high, but that on the whole the rates were fair.  He was not surprised at the lack of patients as arrangements were made well in advance of need.

When put the motion was lost.

Mr Warnes said he would pay the extra cost for a needed hot water point in Nesbit Ward.

A new septic tank has been installed.
