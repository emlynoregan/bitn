Burra Picnic Races were held on 22 October and drew a crowd of c. 1,200.  The racing was enjoyed by all and the novelty events like the sack races, the wheelbarrow race, the hogget race and the sleepy lizard derby, all provided great fun.  The day ended with a party with music from the local band ‘Ramshackles’ from 6 to 9 p.m., followed by the other band, ‘Mamboobies’ to continue the dancing.  Money from the event will aid RFDS and other community groups.  Local clubs and charities with stall did well on the day.
