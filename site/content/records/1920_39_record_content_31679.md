Obituary.  Mr Ernest William Crewes died on Sunday 25 August at the Burra Hospital [aged 70].  He had been admitted on Friday suffering from influenza and complications on Saturday caused the family to be sent for and he died Sunday evening.  His family except for his youngest daughter in NSW were all present.  He was born at Bridgwater, Somersetshire and lived in London till aged 9 when his father died and he went to Cornwall.  When aged c. 19 he sailed for Australia with his mother and only sister (Mrs Hetty Richards) in the Heperus.  He came to Burra and stayed for the rest of his life except for three years at Eurowie near Broken Hill.  He worked first in Aberdeen for H. Gartrell & Co. (in premises now those of Mr Tiddy) for a few months before joining Samuel Drew & Co.  After a few years he took charge of a store they had started at Eurowie and while there was made a JP, often having to marry or bury people.  He returned to Burra and Messrs Charles, John and Thomas Drew retired and in April 1889 he joined John Drew Jnr as a partner in the firm of Drew & Crewes.  This became later a limited company and in 1912 Drew & Crewes Pty Ltd with Mr Crewes as managing director.  He interested himself in many aspects of the town and district life.  He was Mayor for 10 years.  Firstly 1901-02, secondly 1914-19 and thirdly 1921-22; holding office through the Boer War and the Great War.  In both struggles Burra was at the forefront of the patriotic effort and especially in the Great War Mr Crewes was indefatigable and much of the town’s effort was due to his enthusiasm.   His renown as a speaker and an appealer for funds went far and wide and he travelled to many places and even to other states.  He was a member of virtually every society or committee that worked for the welfare of the town or district.  He was greatly respected as a JP and as a local Methodist preacher.  He had virtually retired from public life after the war, but was prevailed upon to return to complete the erection of the Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial.
