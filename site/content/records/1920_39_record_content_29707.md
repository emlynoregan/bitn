Mr & Mrs Maurice Collins’s Farewell at Burra Institute 30 January.

Mayor A.B. Riggs presided and on the platform were the Councillors (T.H. Woollacott, F. Harris, J. Allen, J.E. Pearce & F.H. Collins), W.G. Hawkes (for the Hospital Board), E.F. Marston (President of the Bowling Club), C.W. Pearce (Captain of the Rifle Club) and F. Treloar representing the citizens of Burra.  His political life will compel Mr Collins to live in the city and he has given up his pastoral interests at least for the time being.  He leaves after nine years in Burra, for six of which he was the Mayor.  Speeches are reported from the Mayor, W.G. Hawkes, T.H. Woollacott, Frank Treloar, C.W. Pearce and E.F. Marston.

The Mayor then presented Mr Collins with a paper-weight of malachite and wood from the old mine and a malachite brooch for Mrs Collins, a silver mounted black oak tray and two silver vases for the Misses Jean & Pat Collins.  Mr Collins responded.  [Details extend for c. 2⅓ columns.]
