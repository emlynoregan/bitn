Kooringa News, 15 November

A new silver-lead mine has been found lately on some property belonging to Messrs Roach and Pascoe in the Wheelbarrow Hills about ten miles from Burra.  A small vein led to better samples at 20 feet, which assayed at 80% lead and 6 oz of silver to the ton.  If these indications continue a company will be formed to develop the venture.

Narkara has produced some good specimens lately and the men have several tons of ore at grass.

The Prince of Walesâ€™ birthday was observed as a holiday on 9 November by the trading community.  Mr McCulloch allowed all who chose to picnic in his grounds and to inspect the large and handsome house he has lately erected at Princess Royal.  [Designed by Edmund Wright.]

The road from Kooringa to the Mine store is progressing fast.  All the cutting is nearly completed, the metal broken and so, little remains to be done.
