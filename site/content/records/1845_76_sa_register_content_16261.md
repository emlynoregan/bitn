James B. Winship writes from Newcastle, NSW, 16 December.

I am sorry to find that a number of people have left Kooringa for Adelaide with intention of coming to Newcastle to work for us.  ‘When I left Kooringa I told the men there that I could not say how many men we could take, but as soon as I reached Newcastle I would immediately write to Thos. Chaple who would give them all necessary information.  On the 21st November – the very day I reached here – I wrote to Chaple, saying that the coal trade was very dull and that I could take no more men at present, and that he was to inform the people as soon as possible.’

‘On the 29th November I sent Thos. Chaple the following telegram – “I cannot take one man at present.  The coal trade is dull. Waiting.”’

On 4 December I sent a similar telegram and again on 7 December: ‘Do not send one man to Adelaide.  The Steam Company have distinct orders not to bring one single man.’

I gave people passage tickets to secure a passage to Newcastle, but they were to come when sent for.  No one was to come until I sent for him.

‘I have no doubt all the blame has been put on my head, and many hard things said, as being a deceiver, &c.; but I am sure I had no desire to deceive or lead any one astray, or attempt to deceive those with whom I had any conversation relative to Newcastle.’

‘The Cornish men do not like coal-getting at all, and they are quite disappointed.  They thought getting coal was similar to copper-getting.  Several of them brought by me have absconded already, while others have paid their passage according to their agreement.’
