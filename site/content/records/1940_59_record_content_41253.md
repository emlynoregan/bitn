Burra High School trip to Port Adelaide.

The students left Burra on the 6.55 a.m. railcar last Friday.  Three students, Dawn Nourse, Colin Broad & Donald Edwards, had not previously been to the city.  Three buses at the City Baths took the group to Pt Adelaide.  They visited the Shell Co. Depot at Birkenhead and then went on to Semaphore.  At 1 p.m. they visited Elder, Smith & Co.’s Wool Stores and at 2 p.m. visited the Esk Bank at the wharves where it was unloading phosphate rock from Ocean Island and also the Kelvin Bank which was unloading sulphur from the Gulf of Mexico.  They were shown over the ships before going on to the Sugar Refinery.  Back in Adelaide they got a view over the city from the top of the Shell Building, had tea at the Station and took a look at neon lights in Hindley Street before catching the express home at 6.15 p.m.
