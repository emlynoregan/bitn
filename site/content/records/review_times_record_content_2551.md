The CFS service in the district will be enhanced by the addition of four new antennae on the Mt Bryan Telecom tower and a new CFS radio base will built in a redevelopment of CFS communications in the eastern area at a cost of $20,000.  This will maintain communications with bases in Jamestown and Adelaide and would reach over the undulating hills of the eastern area.  This yearâ€™s fire in the Danggarlli Conservation Park near Renmark had highlighted the inadequacies of communications in the eastern area.
