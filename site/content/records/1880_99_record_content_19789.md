Editorial on the coming ratepayers’ meeting.

The town has been greatly improved in the last few years and the present Council has added to those improvements.  When it came to office much of the expensive work had been done and the Council was in good running order.  It was the right time to impose a parkland rate and get the most difficult account, that of the Recreation Ground, into order.  The ratepayers wisely agreed to borrow money to eliminate the overdraft.  Any further running into debt was then needless and inexcusable.  The new ward divisions made the equitable distribution of work easier.  It has thus been able to do its work without creating any debt that is not covered by claimable Government subsidy.  The main problem with this Council has been its tendency to compare itself with its predecessors and conclude ‘nothing that was ever done before was right, never were things done so wisely as now.’

They often made themselves look small.

The constant over-riding of a minority by a relentless majority has often provoked obstruction and lack of harmony.  This disposition to bluster and fuss has done mischief in the Waterworks question and has harmed relationships between the Government and the Council.
