Boer War.  A social at the Institute on Thursday welcome home Cpl S. [Sappho] Halls.  E.W. Crewes welcomed the corporalâ€™s safe return, saying he had proved himself a daring and dashing soldier.  Dr Sangster Sen. echoed these sentiments and various others spoke in support.  Trooper Heinrich was also welcomed.  He was from SA, though he had enlisted from Queensland.

[Adolph Frederick Heinrich 1874-1923, who later served in WWI as Fred. Hanley.]

Cpl Halls responded briefly.  Capt. J.A. Watt arrived then from Adelaide and was warmly welcomed as the leader of the 5th and 6th Contingents.  He responded to the welcome as did Trooper Heinrich.  Songs and refreshments completed the event.
