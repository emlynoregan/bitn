Burra Burra Show Inc.  The President recommended turning down an application from Burra Poultry Breeders to use the grounds for a show.  Experience showed that sharing the use of the showgrounds led to problems.  After discussion the request was refused.  The same railway arrangements as for 1931 were recommended.  Various other arrangements for details of the next show were made.
