Mongolata Goldfield

Byles’ Mongolata GM Co. is said to have found a rich vein in the main tunnel, but the company has not released any details.

In Parliament the Leader of the Opposition has asked why no publicity was given to the handsome samples from the Takati Claim that were shown to HRH the Duke of Gloucester.

Mt Richards MP has protested the small assistance given to prospectors.

Mr Jenkins LCL said few fields could claim to be developed out of their own profits, but this could be said of Byles’ Mongolata.  The battery had been established chiefly with Federal Government money and the niggardly provision for watering the field was an instance of the poor encouragement given by various SA Governments.  The Premier thought if the field were all that was claimed it should not be necessary for the Government to assist.

In the Advertiser ‘Vox’ reports visiting a veritable Aladdin’s Cave when Mr W. Pexton took him to the safe deposit that holds the big nuggets of gold and the gold-studded ore from the Takati Claim.  One piece like a small cabbage contains about 180oz of gold valued at c. £1,000.  These were shown to the Duke of Gloucester on his visit.  He asked the Duke to select a beautiful specimen of crystalline gold as a gift from Mr Pexton to Princess Elizabeth [later Queen Elizabeth II].
