Paxton Square Cottages

Restoration work has begun.  The eleven cottages on Bridge Terrace overlooking Burra Creek should be completed for tourist accommodation by April 1983.  Architect David Gilbert is aiming to retain the cottagesâ€™ essential integrity and charm, while providing up-to-date facilities.  [Photo of stone mason Jim Howatt of Adelaide at work.]

Salt damp affected stone is being replaced and chimneys and fireplaces are being repaired.  Inside walls are being whitewashed as they were in the 1850s.  Damaged floors will be replaced with timber floors.  Small bathrooms will be added at the rear of each cottage and the lean-to roofs will be replaced.  They will be furnished with simple cottage furniture.  The remaining two wings will be repaired to prevent further deterioration.  The estimated cost of the project is $305,000.
