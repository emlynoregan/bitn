Burra Burra DC has decided to restructure the control of its tourism assets.  The Councilâ€™s Tourism Resource Committee has resolved not to renew the Tourism Executive Officer contract and also the managers of the Tourism Information Centre, Paxton Square Cottages, the Caravan Park and the Mine Museum will all be answerable directly to Council.  The Council will also outsource tourism marketing.
