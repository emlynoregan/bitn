Obituary.  Mr David Wells, a resident for 52 years, died at his residence in Redruth on Thursday aged 84.  He was born in London in June 1817 and left there 26 September 1848 in the Candahar, arriving at Pt Adelaide 10 February 1849.  He came direct to Burra where he worked for the Smelting Co. assisting to make the office furniture.  After three months he set up his own business as a carpenter and cabinetmaker.  In February 1852 he went to the Victorian goldfields where he spent a year at Forest Creek and Bendigo before returning to Burra.  In 1853 he joined the Burra Lodge MUIOOF and was active in it for many years, being financial secretary for 14 years from June 1854.  He then visited England.  He never married and his only relative in Australia is Mr George Thomas Wells of NSW.
