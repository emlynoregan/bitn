New Walking Trail

On Sunday 17 April the Heysen & Lavender Federation Trails will join at Web Gap.  The celebration will be at nearby ‘Peppermint Springs’.  The Heysen Trail is SA’s best known walking trail.  It got off to a slow start after it was suggested by Warren Bonython in 1969 and by 1978 only 7 km had been constructed.  Then Terry Lavender built the 50 km section from Mt Magnificent to Mt Lofty in three months.  He became the main designer for the track, overseeing construction till its completion in 1992.  Terry was made an OAM in 1994.  In 1998 he got the idea of a walking trail from Murray Bridge along the eastern side of the ranges and then west to Clare – to be called the Federation Trail.  It was renamed the Lavender Federation Trail in 2004.  Over the next two years the trail will be extended from Webb Gap to Clare to link with the Riesling and Rattler Trails.  Another planned trail is the Murray Coorong Trail, following the Murray from Salt Creek on the Coorong to Cadell.
