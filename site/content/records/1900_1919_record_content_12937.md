Obituary.  John Jenkin died at his residence in Ayers St on Friday 27 January on his 73rd birthday.  For over 23 years he was an employee of the Town Council and prepared nearly all the town’s roads and footpaths.  He assisted in the last survey of the town.  He was often appealed to, even of recent days when he was almost blind, to find survey pegs around the town.  He was a long time member of the Burra Lodge and passed through all the chairs.  He was born at Panzibella, Cornwall in January 1832 and Mrs Jenkin was born at Redruth, Cornwall in February 1828.  He arrived at Pt Adelaide on 27 July 1851 on the Omega.  They were married at St Mary’s Burra on 10 February 1852 by Rev. James Politt.  He visited the Victorian Goldfields and worked for a number of years in the Burra Mine.  There are five daughters:
