The Seaside Trip.  Many were up at 3.30 a.m. on Saturday for the annual seaside trip.  The weather was perfect.  The first train reached Semaphore at 9.30 a.m. in exactly four hours.  Two rooms at the Town Hall were placed at the disposal of the visitors.  The sideshows were popular and many went to Adelaide, some to the Victoria Park races and others to the gardens and other places of interest or ‘did’ the city.  The two trains carried some 1,800 people.  Many former Burraites joined the visitors.  Locals got home at 1 a.m. on Sunday morning.  [Given that the second train was scheduled to leave Semaphore at 8 p.m. it must have been a very slow trip back!]
