'Unfortunate' writes on The Burra Mine as an old worker there.  The present operations have no prospect of any active operations eventuating.  No common miner would carry on the work in the way it is being done at present.  Sticking all sorts of equipment in the old workings is not ‘trying new ground’.  The lowering of the water has not resulted in more tributers getting work.  At present things from a mining point of view are as dismal as they can possibly be.
