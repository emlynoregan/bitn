Kooringa News, 28 November

In further demonstrations of the popular indignation and disapproval of the recent elopement effigies of the disreputable pair were mounted on a cart and paraded through the town on Friday and Saturday nights to the special delectation of sundry small boys who followed behind.  The climax on Saturday was the complete destruction of the figures in a bonfire in the presence of a number of spectators.  The couple themselves have again made themselves scarce, no one lamenting or hindering their departure.

The local court today heard a case in which a lady of Black Springs complained that five other ladies of the same place paraded near her place with a cacophony of tin kettles and then created or caused to be created an effigy of her, which was subsequently burnt, for the purpose of annoying her and causing a breach of the peace.  While the evidence gave considerable amusement to the listeners, the accused had less cause to smile when each was fined 20/-.
