Aquarius writes a column ‘Copperopolis’ in mock Biblical style telling of the installation of Holder as Mayor and of the dealings of the Council and of the Councillors:

‘Sampsoni by name, son of Bailiff, of the tribe of Nauctioneers, who worship at the shrine of Bacchus.’

‘Hardyi, by name, son of Mudslinger, of the tribe of Chimneysweeps.’

‘Watti, surnamed Jock - son of Counterjumper, of the tribe of Raggites.’

‘Rabbichi - son of Smithi, of the tribe of Butcherites.’

‘Pinchi by name, son of Milchi, of the tribe of the Gentlemenite.’

‘O’Learyi, son of Tanneri, of the tribe of the Bachelorites.’

The article is concerned mainly with the Waterworks issue.
