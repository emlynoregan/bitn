Archibald John Appleton, teamster of Copperhouse, was sentenced to 3 months for stealing a sheep from Austin’s slaughter yards.  Various parts of the carcase were recovered from the prisoner’s house and the fleece recovered from a creek seven miles east of the town where he had thrown it.  He was dealt with leniently (the full term being 2 years) on account of the poverty in which he and his family were placed.
