Obituary/Inquest.  On 3 August Edward Gascoigne applied to Dr Dashwood for medical advice.  He said he had travelled from Adelaide in search of work as a butcher, but failing that had been working as a shepherd.  He had been in the colony for 20 years.  He appeared to be suffering gastric irritation, but was quite cheerful and had the symptoms of a simple bilious attack.  The doctor gave him some medicine and he returned to lodge with a woman whom he called Mrs Brown, with whom he and a carter named Lindsay and Lindsay’s wife had travelled from Adelaide.  He returned to the doctor the next day between 3 & 4 p.m. in sickness with severe stomach pain and shivering.  As Mrs Brown was going away, it was arranged Gascoigne would stay at a place for sick bushmen and the keeper of the house sat up all night with him.  At 8 a.m. on the 5 August he made a statement that on Wednesday morning he lay in bed longer than usual and saw Mrs Brown, known as Theresa Clarke, with whom he had been cohabiting in Adelaide, and who came to Burra with him, sprinkle some powder into a pannikin of tea.  He did not drink this, but he did drink one before going to the doctor the next day and from then on had become rapidly worse.  Some five or six hours before his death he swore an oath that the woman had poisoned him.  Some poison was found in the deceased’s swag, of which the woman had been in control.  She was arrested and held in custody on a charge of murder.  The inquest was held the following Saturday by Mr Challoner with Mr Samuel Corvosso Chairman of the jury.

Henry Lindsay, carter of Currie St gave evidence of the relationship of the deceased and the prisoner for some weeks in Adelaide.  He never heard them quarrel and never heard Mrs Brown threaten the deceased.  [He described their journey to Burra and the deceased’s weakened state due to a cold.]  The deceased had tried to get Mrs Brown not to return to her husband, but to stay with him.  He believed Clarke was her maiden name.  The deceased had no money at all.  When he had come to town he said he had been at Guichen Bay barking trees and the Tree Barking Co. had done him out of £15.  [Much more detail is reported.]

Sarah Lindsay said she had been living in Adelaide with Henry Lindsay as his wife (but they were not married).  Her father, Gordon Boyd, lives at Copperhouse.  [Her evidence corroborates that of Henry Lindsay.]

Charles Hubbard, labourer, now living at Mrs Beale’s during his illness gave evidence of Gascoigne’s last hours.  He heard him accuse Mrs Brown of poisoning him.  Christopher Robertson was also then present.  Robertson said the deceased had said three hours before he died that a woman had poisoned him, but he did not name her.  Ann Beale gave evidence of staying up all night with the deceased and how he had told her the account of the powder in the pannikin etc. as above.  He told her she went by the name Jemima Clark, but her proper name was Brown.  [She gave further details of his conversation in which Mrs Brown’s word could be interpreted as confirming her role as a poisoner.]

Dr Dashwood’s evidence repeats the story in more detail.

On 5 August Dr Dashwood saw him in a very weak state and knew he was dying.  Gascoigne then made his statement under oath accusing Mrs Brown of poisoning him.  He had conducted a post mortem, but could not give further evidence on that because he had not had time to examine the contents of the stomach and intestines.

[The statement by Gascoigne is then printed in full.]

A telegram tells us that when the inquest was resumed on Saturday 13 August at 7 p.m. the evidence as to the completed examination of the organs was given and as a result the accused was remanded.

[But see 23 August 1870, page 3 reported the resumption of the inquest on 20 August.]
