Burra Quilters were joined by a few Clare Quilters last Wednesday at the Bowling Club to stitch the Bedford Mystery Quilt.  Several years ago Faye Packham, who has a disables daughter living in one of Bedford Independent Living Units, designed a quilt that could be sold in pre-packed form with the proceeds going to Bedford Industries.  Four designs later, they have raised nearly $250,000 from the kits, as all fabrics have been donated by industry and individuals.  This year 1,200 kits have been sent all over Australia.
