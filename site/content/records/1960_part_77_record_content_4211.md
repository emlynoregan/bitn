A Deputation led by Mr P.H. Quirke MP with members of the Hallett and Burra Burra District Councils waited on the Minister for Roads on 14 October re the highway north of Burra, which has been considerably damaged by winter conditions.  The Minister is considering the matter, but has already made a grant for the Burra Burra DC to construct two cement spoon drains and two culverts on the worst creeks between Mt Bryan and Burra.
