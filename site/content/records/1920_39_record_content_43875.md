Obituary.  Miss Sarah Geake died 12 November at Burra Hospital.  She was the second daughter of the late Mr & Mrs W. Geake Sen. of Kooringa who arrived in Kooringa in February 1854 and made their home in Queen St where the surviving sisters still live.  She was born on 15 July 1859 and after school assisted at home and at her father’s business premises until his retirement.  She was associated with Kooringa Wesleyan Church and Sunday School of which her father was one of the Superintendents for over 20 years.  When the Salvation Army came to Burra she joined and was a strenuous worker until failing health forced her to be less active and she again rejoined the Methodists, working for the Ladies’ Guild.  She had a fondness for fancywork.  She was an early member of the Rechabite Lodge and held all offices therein.  She leaves a brother, William and two sisters the Misses Emma & Lizzie, all of Kooringa.

[Despite the above, the registration of birth gives the date as 27 June 1859 at Kooringa.]
