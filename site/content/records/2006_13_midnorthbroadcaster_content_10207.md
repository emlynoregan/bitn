Phoenix Copper has received encouraging copper and gold assay results from a near-surface diamond core drilling at Princess Royal.  The work continues with results showing visible malachite in most holes.  The indications so far are that the ore would be amenable to low cost heap leach.  The gold lies in material above the copper mineralisation, which would be removed as overburden to access the higher grade copper beneath.
