Burra Regional Art Gallery.  The opening of the new exhibition From Here to There will be held on Friday 22 July at 6 p.m.  At the opening Burra Community School students will parade in ball gowns from the 1950s, 60s and 70s.  This week they had rehearsals and a photo shoot with photographers Kerry Youde and Sasha Grbich.

The Burra Art Society was established by Patricia Brereton more than 20 years ago.  It meets monthly in the Show Hall to create personal works of art in different media. Each year they aim to have two 2-day workshops and a sketching camp or studio visit.  The group has a collection of books and DVDs for loan to members.
