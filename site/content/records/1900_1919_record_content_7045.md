The Bazaar organised by Miss Moffitt’s Class and the Sunshine Workers’ Band was held in the Kooringa Methodist Lecture Hall on Friday.  Mr Dawes of Princess Royal sent a Christmas tree.  The bazaar raised £15-7-4 for the Hospital and the children decided to spend it on an armchair with sedan-like handles for conveying patients up the hospital steps and on other items.
