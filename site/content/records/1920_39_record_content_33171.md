Obituary.  George Bailey of Leighton was riding home from the Burra Market on 17 January when he had a seizure and fell dead from his horse.  When his horse reached home a search was made and he was found lying dead on the road.  He was aged 70.  The exertion of halting a bolting team a few days earlier may have hastened his end.  He was a farmer and all his life was noted for his high class horses and other stock.  He was the youngest son of the late John Bailey Sen.  T.H. Bailey of Gum Creek Hanson is the only surviving brother.  He is survived by a widow nee Miss Boyd, one son and five daughters: Wilfred Bailey (Farrell’s Flat), Mrs C. Schultz, Mrs White, Mrs T. Schultz, Miss Hazel and Miss Greta Bailey and several grandchildren.  [Born 8 Jun 1859 Gum Creek.]
