‘Hardy advertises that “he believes his veracity will hold its own with that of Shortridge” ____ I think so too.’

Mr Symon said such a comment from the person interested was ludicrous.

The other passage from the Jamestown Review of 20 April 1892 was Hardy’s response to the Record’s report of the Stacey Co.’s  production of Hans the Boatman and Mr Stacey’s speech in the interval which in turn was a reaction to the scathing report on the show by Hardy.  Hardy challenges the Record or Stacey to prove the truth of ‘the most inconsistent false and brainless stuff imaginable’ besides accusing Davey of publishing ‘a garbled statement made by Stacey on stage.’

Hardy also wrote a letter on this matter to the Record accusing Stacey of making statements that were false and unworthy.  Hardy admitted calling the performance ‘a Vulgar Leg Show’.  He accused Stacey of lying when the latter said Mr Lake had kept Hardy’s remarks out of the Review out of respect to me etc.

Another letter produced from Hardy to the paper accused the paper of false and slanderous statements in a garbled attack.

Hardy said the Record had claimed that ‘The Burra Scribe to the Catholic Paper sarcastically remarks that Mr Holder is the Leader Writer to this Journal’

‘I say this is a wilful lie.’

A further letter on 20 April complained that his previous one had not been published.

He had objected to a paragraph which said a lady had threatened to horse whip him.

Hardy: ‘Yes, he made a mistake when he said it was a “lady”.’

Hardy did admit that the lady had come to his office and gave him a bit of her mind.

Symon then turned to the incident of the burning of Hardy’s effigy.

Hardy said he was present for part of the time.

He admitted hearing part of the Captain’s speech on the occasion and admitted he had published in the Register a letter denouncing the Broken Hill strike.

Symon then produced the Register of 9 July 1892 with the article:

‘LARRIKINISM AT BROKEN HILL’ and Hardy’s letter under that heading.

Hardy described the strikers as:

‘the mob, or a lot of ex-counter jumpers and others who have got a job underground and at the meetings of their own Unions out vote the men who know their business.’

Hardy claimed not to have changed his mind about the strikers.

Symon then asked him to explain a letter of his in the Barrier Miner on 5 Sept. 1892 in which he asks the workers of the Barrier to take courage and they might soon have ‘proved to the moneybags that might is not right.’

The letter goes on to argue on the side of the workers:

‘I hope the men; now they have made a start, will stick to their flags, and refuse to be made the machines the capitalistic crowd is evidently trying to make them.’

Symon asked Hardy if he did not find this a little opposed to his letter in the Register.

Hardy, ‘What has that to do with the case?’

Symon then quoted the Southern Cross of 15 July 1892 in which Hardy first responds to the Record’s comments on his suggestion that Holder was their leader writer and denies he offered his services for 10/- a week ____ he says the offer was for half a day’s work ‘principally going through proofs.’  He then goes on to describe a party of 30 larrikins in black faces who gathered to collect money for the  Broken Hill strike fund; a meeting at which two persons were burnt in effigy.

‘The larrikins mustered well here on Monday night.  Mob rule was nearly in vogue here last week.  Five –pound notes flew about very freely on Monday night here.  Several of the Burra youths worked harder on Monday than for some time previously.’

Mr Symon, ‘What? Do you say that?  You have been mud slinging for the last eighteen months and you have the effrontery to come into court with a libel action.  (Cheers)’

Symon then raised an article in the Jamestown Review, ‘ABOUT New’s (?) PAPERS’.

[This article sarcastically refers to the way the leaders of newspapers (not the Record) are put together by a few lines of introduction followed by column inched of matter cut from Hansard etc. but it doesn’t matter the editor (not the Record) produces a two column article in ten minutes by such means ____ as long as they have a strong thumb that can stand the demand made by the scissors, ‘because nobody will read it anyhow’.  This article was printed shortly after Davey had taken over the Record from Murrie.]

Hardy denied that this was intended to ridicule Davey’s capacity for writing leaders.

‘No I didn’t know he wrote the leaders.’

Symons, ‘Did you do it for the purpose of making people laugh at the way the Record was got up?

Hardy, ‘I didn’t see anything to laugh at.’

Symons then raised an article in the Jamestown Review of 2 March 1892 which again raised Mr Shortridge’s comments on the Council election, at a presentation.

Mr Symon, ‘There is not much in anything you write except abuse, and yet you are the gentleman who wants damages for libel.  Did you call the paper a “cad of a newspaper”?’

Hardy, ‘Yes and I would do so again.’

Symon, ‘Did not Lake tell you he had to apologise to Davey for these attacks of yours?’

Hardy, ‘No.’

Symon, ‘You saw in the Record that they apologised?’

Hardy, ‘Yes’
