Burra Hospital Auxiliary.  Annual Report

The Melbourne Cup Luncheon proved a good money-maker and proceeds allowed the purchase of two recovery trolleys and also an air and water mobile chair.  During the year we donated a blood glucose machine.

Other catering efforts were for the Police seminar, Burra Community Development Program, Mid North Tourist Association, the Hospital opening and Council teas.  Including the Melbourne Cup Luncheon, catering raised nearly $3,500.  Hospital CEO Mr John Chilton was farewelled in August.  An Irish New Year Ball will be held on 1 July 1995.
