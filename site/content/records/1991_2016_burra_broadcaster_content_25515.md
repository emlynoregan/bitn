Letter.  Tony Thorogood writes commending Janelle Cousins’ contribution to the promotion of tourism in Burra.  Since opening their business, he has noticed an increase in visitors from outside SA.  This he ascribes to the rebranding of the region as Clare valley, which brings the focus of Sa Tourism’s ‘Secrets’ campaign on our region, and secondly to ‘The Burra and Beyond’ brochure pioneered by Janelle.
