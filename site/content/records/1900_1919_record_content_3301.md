Redruth Court, 10 April

Thomas Rosewall & Albert May were each fined 10/- + 10/- costs for drunkenness and the use of ‘choice Billingsgate’ at the World’s End Sports.

Frederick Sellars was fined 10/- + 10/- costs for interfering with police on the same occasion.

Frederick Camp was charged on the information of his wife with having assaulted her on 4 April.

Mrs Camp claimed he was drunk and struck her knocking out two teeth.  He hands were also injured in the struggle.  He also assaulted their son George who had come to his mother’s aid.

Frederick Camp strongly denied all this.

George Camp’s evidence supported his mother.

Frederick Camp said his wife was drunk and had attacked him, dragging him by his whiskers and scratching his face.  He was fined £2, but with court fees of 13/-, attorney fees of £1-1-0 and informant fee of 5/-[and presumably other costs] he was in total parted from £4-11-0.

Henry Skews was fined 10/- plus costs amounting in all to £3-5-6 when he was charged with assaulting Alfred Stanley Lines at Booborowie on 26 March with a pick handle.  Lines claimed £5 compensation.  Lines gave evidence saying Skews hit him with a pick handle and also struck him on the chin and temple with his fist tore his shirt from his back and scratched his chest.  He had also caught him and dragged him by his ears.  Skews said Lines had got into his house and stolen items.  Lines admitted entering the house, but only to get some sugar.  Lines did admit taking a bridle and then destroying another by cutting a bit out of it because ‘it looked better on the other bridle’.  He then tried to repair the damaged bridle by cutting up a coupling used for the horses.  When questioned, Lines admitted to a whole series of failures to carry out instructions.  Each in itself was a relatively minor thing, but they clearly had a cumulative effect.  Skews admitted the assault, but not the use of a pick handle.

The Bench conceded the provocation, but said it did not justify Skews taking the law into his own hands and assaulting the lad.

David Alexander Stewart was found drunk on three days within a week and as a result was sentenced to 24 hours imprisonment on Wednesday, fined 5/- on Thursday and fined £1 on the following Monday.
