The Smelts Chimney.  There is a rumour abroad that someone wants to buy the old chimney and demolish it so the bricks can be used in outbuildings.  It would be a great shame to see it go and we think representations should be made to the proprietors Messrs A.J. & P.A. McBride by the Council or other responsible body.
