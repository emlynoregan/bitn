Editorial on Council Finances.

The Council has now adopted a revised statement of money available for expenditure.  One or two things are most striking.  The general idea had been that the loan would, with subsidy, provide a respectable sum for expenditure in works and so improve the town and provide employment.  A couple of months ago the Council estimated there would be £393 to expend on works and now with the loan there will be only £500 to spend in the year, of which £109-16-3 has already been spent, besides about £15 passed on Saturday night.  This shows that the original estimate of £393 was altogether wrong, as is now admitted.  As to Mr Lane’s assertions at the loan meeting, the new figures justify his concern.  With the expenditure so low on works the cost of management is even worse than Mr Lane represented.  Management appears to be £223, or 44.6% of the works outlay.  Total salaries according to the Mayor are only £5 in excess of those paid last year.  Further and larger economies must be practised.
