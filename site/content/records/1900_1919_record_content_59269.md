RSL Soldiers’ Rest Rooms.

The renovated first floor rooms of the Eastern Telephone Syndicate were opened on the 14 March by Mrs G.W. Hawkes as the RS & SIL Soldiers’ Rest Rooms.  There are reading, lounge and billiard rooms.  At 1.30 p.m. a procession left Aberdeen PO headed by the Cheer-up Ladies’ band.  Sgt Ingwood VC rode at the head with a large Union Jack.  The band wore their new smart uniforms for the first time.  Previously they have worn white dresses, but not a uniform.  Now they are in crème coats and skirts relieved with silver buttons and crème felt hats to match.  Next to them came returned Light Horseman, then a squad of Infantry & Artillerymen, Boy Scouts, then wives & mothers of volunteers, followed by fathers and then children from the Burra State & High schools.  They were followed by a series of motor cars carrying representatives of the patriotic societies.

Guests were Sgt Ingwood VC, Captain Bowers, J. Kay (Sec. of S & S Fathers’ Assoc.), A. Fearby (Gen. Sec. of RSL Adelaide), G.K. Jenkins MP, W.B. Page, W.G. Hawkes & Mrs Hawkes.

There was a concert in the Institute in the evening opened by the Ladies’ band.

The day’s activities raised £95, which Mr Hawkes immediately made up to £100. £72-0-6 was raised from the sale of the flag and other money since handed in brings the total to £111-3-11.
