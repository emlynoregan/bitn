C.J. Pearce completed sixty years as secretary of the Secretary of the Rose of Sharon Tent of the IOR Kooringa on 11 June.  Only two people are still living who were members when he was first elected: Bro. William Anderson and Bro. John Anderson, both of Sydney NSW.  Tent meetings were then held in the Baptist Chapel, now the Council Depot.  They later moved to the Burra Institute.
