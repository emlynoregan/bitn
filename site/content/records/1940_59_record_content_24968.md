Burra Town Council, 21 January

Council as trustee of the Bon Accord Bridge will inform the Highways Department that an accident has damaged it.

Burra Electric Supply Co. advises that streetlights are now 75 c.p. because 50 c.p. globes are unobtainable.  The directors are trying to get 200 and 300 c.p. globes for testing at the three locations the Council wanted better illuminated.

Council adopted recommendations made at a special meeting of Council about repairs at the Institute.
