Emergency Service at Burra Hospital Closed

Country Health SA has closed the emergency service at the Burra Hospital effective immediately.  Residents will have to travel to Clare or beyond for emergency treatment.  The closure was confirmed on Monday by a visit to the Burra Medical Centre by A Country Health SA representative.  The decision will stand irrespective of any changes that could be made to keep the services at the hospital.  Dr Lakman Fernando said he was saddened by the decision.  He said Country Health SA was not satisfied with the service provided by his wife (Dr Dharma Dissanayake) even though they had been here only once.  He said they were not even allowed to help in an emergency.  Dr Fernando said the Burra Medical Centre was in danger of being closed, but the two doctors said they own the practice and would continue to stay open for the community, ‘even though it is not a viable business.’
