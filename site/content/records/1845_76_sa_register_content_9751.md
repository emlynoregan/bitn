The work of the year to which these figures refer consisted of supervising an average of 400 workmen employed in the production of 6,862 tons of copper ore; the preparation for market and the delivery to the Copper Company, and the receipt from them of 732 tons of copper in return, the shipment and sale of the latter to England and India, conducting the correspondence concerned therewith, the keeping of the accounts and the disbursement of £80,142, including £26,960 pf profit, divided among the shareholders in three dividends.

The expenses of management for the year just ended amounted to £5,008.  Ore raised was 9,859 tons.  Total expenditure was £127,664-11-5, including £28,015 paid in dividends.  The estimated profit for the year is set down at £81,010-17-11.  The average number of men employed was 650.

The Captain’s report on the progress of the mine is generally exceedingly favourable, though in connecting Ayers’ No. 2 Shaft with Schneider’s and Roaches at the 50 fathom they passed through several fathoms of hard rock where they had expected to be in lode.  The company’s establishment at Kooringa consists of 674 persons including 357 miners, of whom 258 are tributers.  There are 176 ore-dressers, 98 labourers, 32 mechanics and 11 officers.  The entire staff of the company is 688 persons.

The seven year contract with the Patent Copper Company (now the English & Australian Copper Company) for the sale of ores raised at the mine, expired this month, but it expected that a new contract will be made with the company.  There are upwards of 4,000 tons of ore on hand yet to be delivered under the terms of the contract.

The company is sinking a suitable shaft on their Karkulto property, with a view to working the large and rich copper lode discovered there.

The exports of copper from the Burra Burra Mine this year are likely to add considerably to the wealth of the colony as well as to the fortunate owners of the company.
