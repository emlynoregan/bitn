Burra Town Council, 19 March.

Letter from the DC re fencing the stock road was received.

Cr Sampson said the Town Clerk’s letter had been misconstrued and he moved a committee investigate the matter.

Cr Harris 2nd as it was distinctly understood the DC would fence the new road.

Cr Parks said the DC Chairman had been asked directly if that portion of the road was to be fenced and had said yes.

The motion was carried and a deputation will wait on the DC.

The new by-law re hawkers was presented.

Cr Sampson opposed it.  He thought it was a fad worked up by Cr Hardy.  Who, he asked, had asked for it?  Why would ratepayers want to pay more for fish, fruit etc.?

Cr Parks supported it, because hawkers paid licences in other towns.

Cr Sampson said the hawkers would simply get over the requirement by canvassing for orders.

Cr Rabbich supported the by-law.

Cr West opposed.

Cr Harris supported.

Cr Hardy gave notice he would move to rescind by-law 26 and replace it with the new one.

Waterworks.

Resolved the water rate for 1895 be 3/- per 1,000 gallons up to the price paid for rates and then 2/6.

Local Board of Health.

Henry Roach wrote to the Board formally complaining of Messrs Rabbich & Sons boiling down establishment adjacent to their butchering premises.  He had lived nearby for three years and had been almost continuously annoyed.  He was satisfied that if a complaint were made to the Central Board the matter would be speedily resolved and ‘I will not hesitate to make such complaint,’ he wrote.

Cr Sampson said the same question had cropped up when Mr Holder was Mayor and the Central Board had given instructions.

Cr Hardy asked if anyone else had complained.

The Inspector said some years ago 6 or 7 had signed a requisition and there had been complaints since.  He had served a notice on 14 March.

Cr Rabbich felt he had been singled out as other boiling down establishments were just as bad.

The Mayor said that was not the question: they had to deal with the letter received.

Cr Harris said the smell came also from Austin’s

Cr Rabbich said he would restrict boiling down to winter and further fit a tight cover with a flue into the chimney.

The mayor said that would not do.

Cr Sampson moved that boiling down be not allowed within the Corporation limits.  Cr Parks 2nd.

[The next issue gives the voting as Sampson, Parks, Harris & West for with Rabbich and Hardy against.]
