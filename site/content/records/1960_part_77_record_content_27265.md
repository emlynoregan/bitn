Burra High School Speech Night was held in the Burra Town Hall on 14 December.  S.L. Tregenza, retired Principal of Brighton High School was the guest speaker.  The Hon. Member for Burra, P.H. Quirke, also attended.  Mrs Tregenza presented the prizes and Mr Quirke presented certificates and trophies to the boys and Mrs Quirke did the same to the girls.  Mr Darrell Field as Chairman of the High School Council was in the chair.

The headmaster Mr R.M. Farrow reported on the year:

We have recently seen the election in Mr Field of only the fourth Chairman of the High School Council.  This is a fine record of service for chairmen over such a long period.  Both Mr A.B. Riggs and Mr H.J.B. Jennison, past chairmen, are present and the latter only retired after 18 years of service and 12 as chairman.  Their wives also served long periods as members of the Council as well as on the Parents & Friends’ Association.

[Mr Farrow also welcomed the Mayor & Mayoress, Mr Finch Chairman of the DC and Mr Auhl, Headmaster of the Primary School and Mrs Auhl, as well as the religious instructors.]

Last year’s public examinations resulted in the awarding of 24 Intermediate Certificates and the completion of two others.  Four Leaving Certificates were gained and one was completed.  Three others were gained in the Supplementary Examinations.  Lynette Robinson and Denise Griffen won Intermediate Exhibitions and Eleanor Miller and Gregory Short gained Continuation Scholarships.

This year the club period has continued and sport has continued to play its vital role with inter-house matches and inter-school exchanges against Balaklava and Clare High Schools, while matches against Riverton will be played tomorrow. In the Inter-High School Sports Day Burra won the E.E. Williams Handicap Shield for the second successive year and only narrowly missed the Championship Shield.

The swimming carnival in March was an outstanding success.

In September 36 Intermediate and Leaving students accompanied by Miss Jones, Miss Briggs, Mr Morris and myself undertook a ten day tour to Sydney and Canberra – a very exciting and worthwhile trip and recently a party of 44 First and Second Year students had a recreational weekend at the Parnanga National Fitness Council Camp at O’Sullivan’s Beach, at which Mrs Jones, Mr Ayliffe, Mr Schwartz and Mr Hayward were energetic leaders.
