‘Community News’

Mr McCabe is keen to hear from any member of the community prepared to help with the preparation of the ‘Community News’ on a voluntary basis.  Help is required for several hours on Monday and/or Tuesday each week.  Tasks include collecting articles, editing material, typing, layout and collation.  Over 600 copies are distributed each week and community contributions are increasing.  School office staff need community assistance.  Production costs are also rising; they were $1,200 for 50 weeks in 1979.  The generous financial support of Apex has been appreciated, but if the groups who regularly use the community News could make an annual donation it would ease the financial burden on BCS.
