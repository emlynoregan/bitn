Obituary.  Carl Herman Mann died 21 February at Baldina.  He was born 30 December 1870 at Point Pass [registered as Hd of English] and his twin brother Friedrich August Mann died in early infancy.  He was the eldest son of the late Friedrich August Mann and his wife Emilie, nee Klaebe.  The family moved to Robertstown where he attended the Lutheran Day School.  At 14 they moved to Baldina.  As a lad he minded sheep for his father at a number of places from Bright to Morgan and later when his parents returned to Robertstown he took over the sheep run of 10,000 acres.  In 1910 he married Martha Julia Neissen, nee Simbouski [Martha Julia Riessen, nee Simbowski] who died 25 July 1942.  He then lived with his daughter Mildred and son-in-law Mr Thomas Williams.
