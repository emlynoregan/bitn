Burra Progress Association held its AGM last Tuesday.  President, Mr F.T. Sara, said they had not held many meetings during the year, but had been active in promoting the welfare of the town.  The Secretary had been busy in promoting the re-opening of the Burra Mine and as a consequence the Federal Copper Commission had undertaken to look at the Burra Mine when they were visiting SA.  Burra would then be able to put up as good a case as anywhere in Australia.  The efforts of the Town Council would see the re-opening of the Aberdeen Quarries, with the material used in the construction of the tank at Hanson, which was to be built.  [The tank in connection with the Morgan-Whyalla pipeline, then under construction.]  The scheme to relocate people from Adelaide to fill empty houses in Burra was already bearing fruit.  Many almond trees, supplied by Mr Kuchenmeister, had been planted by the Council.  Burra might have gone back a bit, but so had every country town in SA except where they were being industrialised or had a military camp.  A deputation will wait on the District Council about the poor state of the Farrell Flat Road, which is adversely affecting Burra trade.  A letter of appreciation will be sent to Smithâ€™s Weekly thanking it for its support of the Burra Mine.
