The Mayor said money already collected was for tree planting, with certain exceptions, but there had been promises of funding and also of cement.  Profits from Centenary Week would go towards the pool project.

Cr Dow said the plans had been laid on the table and moved they be approved and that the money be raised by 5% debentures and immediate steps be taken to obtain the consent of ratepayers.  With some minor amendment this was passed.

Cr Dow said that based on a pool 75 ft x 25 ft x average 5½ ft deep the capacity was 64,400 gallons and with water changed weekly the running costs were estimated for a six month season to be:

Water	£41-18-6

Wages	£52-0-0

Interest	£20-0-0

Sinking Fund	£40-0-0

General Maintenance	£12-10-0

Lighting	£15-0-0

Total	£181-8-6

A daily attendance of 80 at 3d per person would bring this in and he thought that would be exceeded.

The Mayor said that the pool would not be filled to the brim and its capacity would thus be 50,000 gallons.  By fitting scum valves at the top and drawing water from the bottom only, the water requirement would be 20,000 gallons per month.  £15 for lighting was excessive.

The offer of the Hydraulic Engineer to supply water was accepted.
