Burra School

The Minister of Education Mr Hugh Hudson has announced the finalised plans for the new school at Burra.  Land is now being acquired adjacent to the present school.  New accommodation will be built for the High School and the old solid building will receive extensive modification to provide modern primary teaching areas.  The proposals have met with a favourable reception from school bodies and the local council.  Mr Hudson outlined the advantages of the proposal. [Previously noted.]
