Erection of the Corporation Depot and its fencing: £54-17-3.

The making of the George St Ford across the Burra Creek.

Lamp lighting cost £36-9-2.

In Health the septic tank at the Hospital has been the main concern and efforts now being made to combat the smell should be effective.  The tank is now completely covered and the effluent will discharge into a deep pit, presently being sunk.

Otherwise the town has been healthy.

The incoming Council will have to extend the cemetery and enclosing this will dispose of the credit balance now standing at £74-8-2.

Councillors then spoke.

Cr Burns:

He had served the ward for 4 years and was retiring from that position.  He had always voted for what he considered right and against what he considered wrong.
