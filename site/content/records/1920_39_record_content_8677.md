A Bolt.  A dray of Mr McKenzie, storekeeper of Kooringa was being driven by a lad, Percy McLennan in Bridge St when the winkers came loose and the horse bolted along Mitchell & Cemetery flats and then via the Pig & Whistle and Thames St, through Market Square and up Mt Pleasant, down the side of St Joseph’s and back through Market Square and Commercial St where George Lines managed to get onto the back of the dray and thence onto the horse’s back and pulled it up.  In leaping out of the way on the turn into Mt Pleasant Lawrence Henderson knocked himself unconscious.

[This route doesn’t make sense.  Perhaps it started in Bridge Terrace rather than Bridge St and it suggests that in 1922 Bridge Terrace ran into Mitchell Flat.  It does on maps, but now does so only as a footpath.  The rest of the route is clear.]
