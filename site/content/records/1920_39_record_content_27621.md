Redruth Court

Spencer Gregory Pickering of Aberdeen was charged by Sgt George E. McDonald that on 11 June he falsely pretended to Theodor John Blucher of Waterloo that a company had been formed to make paper from straw and that for buying 50 shares in Central State Paper Ltd he would be appointed District Inspector at £6 per week and commission of 1/- per acre of straw bought, by which means he falsely obtained £12.  In an allied case he was charged with obtaining £50 from Jacob Giles Wardle of Redruth.  He was remanded to Riverton Police Court on 10 August.
