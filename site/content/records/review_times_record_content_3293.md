The Burra Burra Mine Model at the Bon Accord Museum is taking shape.  After months of planning a modelling weekend was held last weekend and volunteers helped designer and builder Pam Marlow in putting the model together.  Pam spent her childhood and teenage years immersed in model railways and it was there she gained her skills in creating realistic buildings and landscapes.  The model is based on a number of pictures and drawings and is reproduced on a 1:87 scale.  As this is a standard railway scale, it allowed the purchase of commercially produced extras such as people.  The model covers 30 square metres and the timber alone cost $3,500.  Others have contributed their skills and knowledge, including Moonta historical designer Peter Stitt, local tradesman Brian Salter and historian and local librarian Colin Fidock.  The landscape aspect of the model was completed last weekend and the detailed models of buildings, people and mines will be slotted in during the weeks leading up to the 5 October opening.  The whole thing has been designed in modules so that in future models can be slotted out and replaced by those who feel they can do better, said Pam.  0
