Obituary.  Mrs Percival C. Herbert nee Gladys Lawn died 14 November aged 38.  She was born in Burra on 31 March 1899, the only child of Mr & Mrs George Lawn of Kooringa.  She married P.C. Herbert in 1923.  She was a popular member of the Kooringa Methodist Choir, a pianist for the Sunday school and a member of the Ladiesâ€™ Cheer-up Band.  In her early married life they lived at Minlaton, but Mr Herbert later took a position in Adelaide and they lived at Prospect.

[Apparently born Gladys Irene Lawn, but birth not traceable on Births CD.  Marriage data confirms obituary statements.  She died in Adelaide, residence Prospect.]
