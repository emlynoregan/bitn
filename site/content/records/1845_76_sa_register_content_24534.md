Kooringa: A Dilapidated Town.

It is pleasing to see that the SA Mining Association is beginning to repair its numerous cottages and make little additions to the roads and footpaths.  The town has been in their hands for more than 20 years and the signs of the amount spent on it by the landlords, who are supposed to have drawn rent from every house until recently, are few and far between.

‘The tenants, following the example of the owners, have been equally indifferent as to appearances, and the consequence is that Kooringa has been shabby, and many of the houses, if such they can be called, are among the most squalid in the British Empire.

In walking up the main street one sees business places paintless, and with stucco off their fronts, a stable roof held on by stones to prevent the wind blowing it away, signboards become unreadable owing to the latest coat wearing off and old lettering showing through, a blacksmith’s wooden shop that certainly has not stood upright during the last ten years, unpainted verandah posts, shutters and doors, and the words “Letter-box” still visible on a house that was used as a Post-Office 22 years since.  Taking all these together a stranger is surprised that the thoroughfare should be inhabited by well-to-do tradesmen.  It must not be supposed that all the stores are like those noticed; there are a few exceptions, and of late a considerable improvement has taken place in a few places.’

Last week the Burra Company began covering their cottages in Market Square with iron, besides renovating the police cottage walls.

‘Should this be continued, what with Mr Banks’ new assembly-room and his house undergoing outside improvement, the square would, if the gingerbeer factory had a new face, present a decent appearance.’

[Banks was the landlord of the Miners’ Arms Hotel; now the Burra Hotel.]

‘A stroll among the houses at the back of the commercial quarter has a depressing effect.  Ruins present themselves in every direction – cottages without doors and windows, the roofs often dilapidated; in the inhabited houses belonging to the Company daubed and dirty walls, and paint unknown or very ancient.  There are, however, some changes to be noted even here.  A substantial stone wall has been built around the Wesleyan Mission House and Chapel.  St Mary’s church has also been lately thoroughly repaired inside and out; so have the Bible Christian Chapel and a few private residences of the tradespeople and those of some old inhabitants out of business.  In other direction again all is desolation.  The Burra Company have begun removing a few old walls, and filling up little creeks on the roadways with the ancient mortar and plaster, also making a kind of road from the paddock towards the cemetery.  It is hoped that more refurbishing will go on, and that Kooringa will on entering upon a new career of prosperity be relieved from the disgrace of being styled, as it has been, the shabbiest town in the Australias.’
