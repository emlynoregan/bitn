Second Day

A boxing match was held between Jemmy Dunn, a Burra miner and John Jones, a Sydney native.  It was a match for £10 a-side.  Minute time was agreed on and 16 rounds were fought.

The match went to Jemmy Dunn.

A £5 a-side match followed between John Fortune (black Jack) and Tom Kelly (Snob) near Bunce’s Shaft.  They fought 31 half-minute rounds.  After about 45 minutes the match was decided in favour of ‘Jackey the Black’ to the deafening cheers of the assembled hundreds.

It is rare and remarkable that neither pugilist drew blood.
