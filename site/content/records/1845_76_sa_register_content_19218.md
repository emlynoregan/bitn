Kooringa News, 28 March

Obituary.  On Saturday 24 March a shepherd of Mr William Dare found the remains of a man about seven miles from Caroona and between there and Ketchowla.  He was about 40 years old.  The body was much decomposed and the skin had been dried in the sun.  He must have been a lunatic because he was wearing only a coat, while a new pair of moleskin trousers and a white shirt with lavender stripes were nearby.  No other garments or boots or swag were found.  A nearby sandalwood tree had its branches stripped and laid underneath.  These had been trampled on and a circular track worn around the tree.  He appeared to have been dead eight to ten weeks.

[There is no corresponding death registration.]
