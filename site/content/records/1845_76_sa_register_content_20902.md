He said the general depression of the colony combined with the stoppage of underground operations at the Burra Mine had thrown many people out of work who were now in want of the bare necessities of life.  Distress at the present time was fearful.  Even when work could be found it was often so poorly paid it barely fed the labourer and did not sustain a family.

The first motion by Mr John Young: ‘That this meeting views with deep regret the present unsatisfactory condition of the labour market by means of which large numbers of men are unable to find employment and are with their families thereby placed in a condition of great distress.’  William Cullen seconded and it was carried unanimously.

P. Murphy moved: ‘That in the opinion of this meeting it is desirable that the Government should borrow money for the construction of reproductive works, and that it is highly necessary that immigration should for some time to come be stopped and Sutherland’s Act repealed, thereby setting at liberty the whole Land Fund for public works purposes.’  He said all this distress had been caused by the Government introducing migrants whilst there was no employment for them.  At the next election no candidate should receive support who supported immigration.  Mr Bennett seconded.

R.H. Cook spoke in support.  He said many had migrated to the sister colony and more would do so if they could pay the transit expenses.  There was no inducement to stay in Burra.  Even now there was a shipload of migrants on the water to add to the unemployed.  The resolution was carried.

Mr George Shorter proposed a motion that it was the Government’s duty to push forward public works to furnish employment for the working classes, many of whom had been encouraged to come to the colony because of statements made concerning the better position of workers in SA.  He said it was not widely known that many were living on dry bread and suffering greatly, yet kept their plight secret.  Rather than depend on the scant provisions of the Destitute Board they would approach death.

G. Townsend seconded the motion and said he had lately read with disgust a letter from the Chairman of the Destitute Asylum saying that destitution was not as great as had been represented.  One source of destitution originated from the road contractors who screwed wages so low that their workers could not actually live.

John Vivian, assistant bailiff, spoke in support.  His occupation caused him to witness scenes of the greatest distress and poverty.  Many a poor child had to stay in bed while its mother washed the rags that covered it.

W.H. Bennetts said that for the last three years at the Burra Mine his wages had not averaged £1 a week and in the last six weeks working there they were but 9.6 a week.  He had a wife and four children and had not earned a penny in the last five months.  He would have travelled to seek work, but what was the use when those who had done so had returned without finding any.  On the Roseworthy-Forresters railway some had come back with 29 or 30 shillings after five weeks’ work.

Joseph Richardson supported this, saying he had worked on the line from 6.45 a.m. till dusk and could not get better than 3/1 a day.

Mr Joseph Beaglehole corroborated that and said it was impossible to support a family on the wages paid for railway construction.

John Sampson Jnr moved: ‘That the present system of letting contracts is open to grave objections and should be discontinued, as men seldom earn sufficient to procure the common necessities of life, and often lose their wages entirely, while the contractor reaps enormous profits, owing to the desperate circumstances in which a man is placed in a time like the present.’

He also spoke against immigration at this time.

Mr Pearce seconded the motion and said the Government was liberal with the contractors, but ought to be fair to the men and see them paid properly for their labour.  Work should be let on small bargains to parties of miners.

Mr Pollard supported the resolution, which passed unanimously.
