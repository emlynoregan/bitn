Football.  The Mid North Association

A meeting at Saddleworth on Friday will decide on the fate of the ‘A2’ grade competition.  Farrell Flat has notified that it cannot field a team in this category and will either have to withdraw or amalgamate with Mintaro.  This would enable Farrell Flat-Mintaro to field ‘A’, ‘B’ and Colts teams, but would leave only Manoora and Watervale in the ‘A2’ competition.
