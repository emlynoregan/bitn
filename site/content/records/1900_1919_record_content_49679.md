Motor Accident.

On Saturday morning c. 4.30 a.m. Streicher Bros.â€™ small charabanc was going to the station with passengers with Mr P. Pederson in a Buick just behind.  Mr Wicklein in his ford approached from the other direction.  Apparently confused by lights and dust Mr Wicklein drove onto the wrong side of the road.  Mr Streicher pulled almost onto the footpath and stopped, but the Ford struck the charabanc amidships and turned it over.  All escaped unhurt except for Mrs Ambrose Harris who sustained a fractured collarbone.  Even she was able to continue her journey and is now progressing well.  Mr Pederson only avoided running into the scene by going up a steep bank onto the footpath at the risk of overturning his own vehicle.  Prompt action by both drivers averted a potentially serious accident.
