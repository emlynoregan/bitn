In the mallee lands the wool was low grade and it was not possible to top-make as much as it was in this district.  It was not necessary to overdo the skirting unless burrs were numerous.  Sometimes it was profitable to go right through the fleece and remove burrs.  If growers wanted to obtain high values a certain amount of classing had to take place.

A flock of 500 would take 3 lines, A.A. & A.

One of 1,000 would take 4 lines, 2 each of A.A. & A. in strong and medium.

If inferior types were carried the smaller grower could not afford to cull.  Anything not conforming to type should be culled.

Rex Warnes said that perhaps next year they would visit Koomooloo.  Mr Warnes thanked the cook, Joe Parks of Burra.

29 years ago he had bought Sturt Vale (of 250 squ. miles) for £7,500.  Everyone said he would fail and never muster sheep there, but the muster had never missed.  Today there were 40 men on the staff.  He had got some land from the Government to add to Sturt Vale.  Mutooroo Pastoral Co. had turned the water off its natural course and left Sturt Vale practically dry.  They had now got water rights back, but had spent £5-6,000 on a weir to divert the water back, but unsuccessfully.  Now they were going to grow lucerne with the water so Sturt Vale could withstand drought.  In several paddocks they were trying to get natural fodder back by keeping stock out.

A visit to Saltbush Dam showed visitors 80 acres of lucerne up to 4’6” high, planted in the bed of a watercourse.  On average Jim Warnes said two floods 50” to 10’ deep and eight miles wide came down every year so there should be plenty of lucerne.

Nearby was a large acreage of what looked like wild verbena 30” high.  Sheep don’t like it much, but bullocks thrive on it.  Back at the homestead there was time for tea and cakes before starting for home.  In a 12 hour trip of about 190 miles there were no mishaps and not even one puncture.
