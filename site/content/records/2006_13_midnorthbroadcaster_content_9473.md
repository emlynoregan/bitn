Accident.  A load of baled wool shifted on a B-double near the Shafton Road turn-off on the Burra Bypass last Thursday causing the vehicle to roll over on the right shoulder of the road.  The driver was trapped inside and SES personnel had to cut the fibre glass roof to release him.  He received non-life-threatening injuries.  A recovery truck came from Adelaide to move the damaged vehicle and local operators, Andy McBride and Bert Seaford handled the wool.  [Photo]
