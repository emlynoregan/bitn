No. 3 Civil Court before Mr Justice Piper

Kenneth Fryar Penrose Sawers pastoralist of Marryatville claimed £900 damages from Drew & Crewes Ltd.  £600 for loss of a thoroughbred mare and £100 for loss of a filly foal plus £200 loss on the mare for stud purposes.  A drew & Crewes employee had driven a car through a group of horses on 5 March 1927 and a piece of piping attached to it had so injured the mare that she lost the foal she was carrying and had to be put down on 9 April 1927.  The defence denied any negligence and accused the plaintiff of driving horses uncontrolled and on the wrong side of the road etc.  The judgement was for the plaintiff for £630 plus costs.
