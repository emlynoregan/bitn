Lewis Board of Management held its AGM 22 November.

Chairman Andrew Gebhardt reported on the success of the cottages since they opened as tourist accommodation last May.  An occupancy rate of 40% would cover financial commitments and they have achieved a rate of 71.6% for the six months.  The rents will not be increased next year.  Work on the Kingston Street row was reported.  It appears that two-roomed cottages are the most popular and so there will be three extra two-roomed cottages in the new development.  Tribute was paid to the caretakers, Brian and Maureen Bevan.
