PAX VOBISCUM [Peace be with you] writes commenting on the very poor turnout for the Thanksgiving Service in the Town Hall on Sunday night.

‘As one who has no orthodox religious views, but who tries to see things as they are, I wonder if the weather over the weekend was an indication of the Lord’s idea of our mythical peace.’

[The writer was also worried that ‘There is no peace, all that we can say is that hostilities have ceased…The last thing I saw in the press was that Russia was preparing for a third world war.’]
