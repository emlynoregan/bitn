The Pastoral Country

On Wednesday, before any rain had fallen in Burra, a report from Ketchowla at 3.30 p.m. said 50 points had fallen in 20 minutes.  Kia-Ora then reported 70 points, while other nearby stations got nothing, but falls started more generally on Thursday night and reports came in constantly till Sunday night.  By Friday Braemar had only reported 19 points, but then at 3 p.m. a call came through to report 145 points in 35 minutes and Ketchowla reported over an inch the same afternoon.  All watercourses throughout the area flowed strongly.  Sample falls:

Braemar 247	Ketchowla 255	Kia-Ora 256

Koomooloo 315	Old Koomooloo 219	Sturt Vale 94

Woolgangi 238	Quondong 75	Pandappa 240

Poonunda over 200.

Miles of fencing has gone, but stock losses seem to have been light.

The north up train on Friday was held up for 1½ hours just past Firewood Creek.  Diprose’s Bridge has been seriously damaged and practically all bridges are likely to need overhauling.  At Baldina Ford the 3 ft pipes have been washed 100 yards downstream and the ford badly damaged.  The road is impassable with access to Mongolata via Baldina Station.

The Eastern Mail did not go out and will probably not leave till next Saturday.

At World’s End Mr Bob Phillips lost miles of fencing and recorded a fall of over two inches.

The inrush of water from the Burra Creek last week is reported to have caused the water in the River Murray to have risen by 14 inches between the locks.
