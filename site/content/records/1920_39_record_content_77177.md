Obituary.  Mr John Doyle died suddenly at Hallett 31 October.  He was born at Mt Bryan East 63 years ago as the youngest son of the late Mr John & Mrs Eliza Doyle, who were among the earliest settlers there.  He was educated at Mt Bryan East School and came to live in Hallett about 46 years ago where his mother ran a general store in the premises known as Edges.  After his motherâ€™s death he took over the business and conducted it in the original premises until he purchased the premises of Drew & Crewes Ltd, opposite, a few years ago.  He was on the Institute Committee for many years and in his early days was secretary of the old Athletic Club and a committeeman until it went into recess.  He was a JP for many years.  About 17 years ago he married Miss Hilda Warren Rowe who survives.  Mrs E. McDonald of Glenelg is a sister.  There is no family.
