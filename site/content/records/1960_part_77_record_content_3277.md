P.H. Quirk MP writes following the Premier’s announcement about the duplication of the Morgan-Whyalla Pipeline.  It is likely the new pipeline will follow the route of the original.  The first route proposed would increase the cost of the large main by £3,000,000 and incur additional pumping costs of £75,000 p.a.  Plans are being drawn up which will provide water to Burra and over the first proposed route to Booborowie.  Pipelines like the one for Burra and Booborowie are built with extension in mind.  Residents further north should waste no time in preparing a petition for water so that the pipeline is built to sufficient capacity to take future loading.
