Ray Chambers of Bagot, Shakes & Lewis then auctioned a Union Jack signed by the Governor-General.  The bids totalled over £900.  In the end it went to J.M. McBride who had bid £210 and J. Tennant was not far behind with £200.  Just as significant was Mrs Brown of Hampton’s bid of 10/-: she has little enough to spare and five boys at the front.

The Mock Court then appeared.

Chief Justice (Mr Hann), and two Judges (Messrs Glenister & Horner), Judge’s Associate (Mr Milner), Court Crier (young Jack Hann) and a bodyguard of women police.

Many were fined from 6d to 5/-.  Finally M-C Kane arrested the judges, jury and police and the Mayor fined each on 1/- for impersonation.

A list is then printed of the takings from the various stalls and activities.

Total takings £1,367-8-4.
