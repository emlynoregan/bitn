Kooringa News, 26 March

The anniversary of the United Presbyterian Church Sunday School was celebrated on Sunday morning with a special sermon preached by the pastor, the Rev. W. Davidson.  In the afternoon the scholars were examined by Rev. Davidson and prizes were awarded.  Rev. T. Lloyd conducted the evening service, when the church was quite crowded.  On Monday afternoon the scholars were given tea, cake and fruit and parent and friends followed on.  A public meeting was then held at which Mr J. Burnell read the report for the past year.

Nothing has been done to the streets during the dry season and so when winter returns we shall be singing the same old song about their miserable state.
