Central Road Board

A long letter was received from Mr W. Mahood relating to a public meeting at Steelton concerning the lain line of road to Burra.

Mr Macaulay added the following comments to his report:

‘Making Kooringa the Terminus’

Line 1.	Springfield-Tothill’s Creek-Apoinga-Logan’s Gap-Langmead’s-Sod Hut Ranges-Kooringa.  33 m 60 ch.

Line 2.	Springfield-Steelton-Long Hill-Springbank-Kooringa.  32 m 39 ch.

Line 3.	Springfield-Tothill’s Creek-Apoinga-Near Black Springs-Long Hill-Springbank-Kooringa.  34 m 12 ch.

Line 4.	Springfield-Tothill’s Creek-Apoinga-Near Black Springs-Karkulto Mine-Langmead’s-Sod Hut Ranges-Kooringa.  33 m 31 ch.

Line 5.	Springfield-Steelton-Black Springs-Long Hill-Springbank-Kooringa.  33 m 12 ch.

Line 6.	Springfield-Steelton-Black Springs-Karkulto Mine-Langmead’s-Sod Hut Ranges-Kooringa.  32 m 31 ch.

Two deputations waited on the Board; one in favour of the Tothill’s Creek route and one in favour of the middle road.

J.G. Daly for the Tothill’s Creek Road:

The distance was less

The quality of the materials available en route was better

Water was abundant all along the line

Settlers had laid out a lot of money with the supposition it would remain the main line

A great deal of land would be opened up on the east side of that line of road

Mr S. Dawson for the middle road:

The distance was less

More agricultural land would be opened up

The supply of both materials and water on the route was as good as on the Tothill’s Creek line.

He said he favoured route 6.

Mr Rounsevell said he had travelled the routes for 17 years and favoured No. 1.

Mr J.E. Miller supported the middle road.

Mr Harris spoke for Tothill’s Creek Road.

A decision was deferred.
