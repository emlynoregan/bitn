T.P. Ford & R.C. Willshire write as delegates from Aberdeen to the Burra Football Association in response to ‘Goal post’

They say the main thing wrong according to the writer is that the Association is not being run solely for the benefit of the Kooringa Club.  They dispute the financial information he cites as being more than the delegates or anyone other than the secretary knows.  They also dispute the claim to unfairness in the premiership arrangements.  The places where the games are played were a result of the Kooringa Club’s amendment of the program!  The rules of the Association are taken from the Yorke’s Peninsula Football Assoc. and are not the product of local minds.
