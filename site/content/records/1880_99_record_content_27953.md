W.H. Hardy writes supporting a heavy land tax because:

It would strike at absentee landowners and those keeping large areas of land merely for sport.

It would stop speculation and gambling in land.

Unused land would be forced into production.

He then goes on into a more hysterical diatribe against the exploitation of the masses.
