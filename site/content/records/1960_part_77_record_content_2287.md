Burra Post Office

Mr C.R. Kelly MHR cut the ribbon on Monday night 9 May to officially declare open the new Burra Post Office.  Local Postmaster Mr O. Tattersall introduced Mr Sullivan, Director of Posts and Telegraphs, who welcomed all to the ceremony.  The building was erected by Taras & Co., Builders.  The CWA ladies provided refreshments in the RSL Hall.  His worship the Mayor Mr E.T. Baulderstone congratulated the PMG on the erection of such a suitable and up-to-date post office in Burra in an ideal situation.  Mr Quirke said he would like to see an extension of the shelter in front of the building to cover people using the private boxes.  In his speech Mr Kelly referred to the history of the town and the Burra Mine and also to the history of its post office.  A post office was established at the Mines in 1847 and the first postmaster was Mr H.M. Buswarra [sic: for H.M. Boswarva].  The town comprised five settlements: Kooringa, Redruth, Aberdeen, Copperhouse and Hampden [sic: for Hampton].  Kooringa was the largest and a post office was established there in 1849 under postmaster Thomas Grant.  In 1858 a peppercorn lease was granted by the mining company to the PMG’s Department.  The old stone post office is thought to have been built in 1860.  In 1942 [sic: actually on 1 December 1939] the name was changed to Burra to save confusion, since the railway station and District Council were already known by that name.  Telegraph facilities were provided at Kooringa in 1860 and a telephone exchange, with two subscribers, was established in 1911 – Elder, Smith & Co. Ltd and Bagot, Shakes & Lewis.  A telephone trunk line to Adelaide was provided on 1 April 1920.  Today there are more than 300 subscribers connected to the Burra Exchange and two rural automatic exchanges at Gum Creek and Hanson are controlled from Burra.  From 1 May last the local call service area of Burra has been greatly extended.  In the past year the Burra Post Office handled:

Postal articles	591,655

Telegrams	5,614

Trunk calls	125,281

Local calls	145,431

The new building has an area of 16,000 square feet and cost £17,500.

The old building will accommodate telecommunications equipment and the telephone exchange.  At present there are 32 people on the staff of the PMG at Burra and the present postmaster Mr O.A. Tattersall has held the position since 1950.  [Photo of Mr Kelly cutting the ribbon.]
