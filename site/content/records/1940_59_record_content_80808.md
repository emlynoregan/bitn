The President’s Report

The 1957 Show was held on 12 October in fine weather.  Gate takings were the highest for several years and a successful gala night was organised by the Rural Youth.

Mr Ewen Waterman opened the Show.

The poor season notwithstanding, the entries were a record for post war shows, at 2,459.

The Birds Section was outstanding with nearly 1,000 exhibits. Flowers were also outstanding.  We thank all who have donated trophies and given other support through the year, including the Burra Record.  The financial position is not as good as last year.  The appeal to cover the cost of installing the louvres fell far short of its target and the cost of improvements in the lower pavilion [sic: flower pavilion?] is mainly responsible for the higher overdraft.  An increase in revenue is essential for the smooth running of the show.

The statement of receipts and payments is printed and shows a bank overdraft of £128-19-2 at 31 December 1957.
