Demolition of the Bible Christian Church.

For some time the church has been decaying.  The first part to go was the ceiling, but after the union of the churches wind moved some of the slates and allowed water to penetrate the walls.  It had been hoped the building might fall of its own accord.  The western end of one of the principals decayed and last Thursday night it left its bearing and the western wall bowed out about two feet at the top, but did not fall.  In the interests of public safety the building had either to be demolished or made safe.  The uncertain state of the wall made demolition uncertain and eventually it was decided to use dynamite.  Many of the community found this news distressing.  Some wished to end the church’s life by singing a hymn or two and saying a prayer in the building, but the clear movement of the walls made this too dangerous.  Between 9 7 10 o’clock on Saturday holes were drilled halfway up the walls and plugs of dynamite inserted.  A large crowd watched as the first explosion in the damaged section had little effect; neither did the second in the western corner.  Three more charges had been inserted when the western wall gave way, bringing down the roof with its estimated 60 tons of slate along with the massive rafters and principals.  The building was erected some 48 years ago at a cost of about £2,200.  The cable between the two gables snapped leaving the front one untouched and the northern gable out of plump [sic] about six or nine inches.

The crash of the roof and thud of the wall was heard for a considerable distance and the dust that rose obscured the whole of the building and sent observers back to escape being smothered.  The Record photographer emerged from the dust cloud covered in it, but having secured the desired photographs.  One who had experience of using dynamite in Broken Hill said the old building was stronger than ever he had anticipated.  They then resorted to taking down the wall by manual strength, but only a little headway was made due to the quantity of the stuff to be moved.  The side walls are 18” wide and the gable ends 2’.  The roof and associated woodwork is estimated at over 80 tons.

Present were Mr John Sampson, the oldest adherent in the town, Mr Richard Thomas and William Harris.  On Methodist Union the gallery and floor were removed and sold and many seats scattered round are testimony to the sale.  Sam Hill and William Harris, who were selected for the demolition, had scrambled over the scaffolding when it was built.  The church replaced the small building near Henderson’s Bridge now known as the schoolroom.  The enlargement was needed when Rev. Way brought about a revival and nearly 300 members joined the church.  It had in its time a fine choir.  The first minister was Rev. Samuel Way [sic: corrected next issue to James Way] then Revs. Hillman & Rowe.  Cornish miners gave all the necessary labour carting the stone, timber, iron etc. free of charge during the building of the church.  When many people went to the Yorke Peninsula mines there was plenty of room in the church, but the remaining adherents never lost interest in it.  Now it is roofless and floorless with the windows destroyed and the two huge gable ends still standing.

The [original] contractors were Messrs Burgoyne (the present MP) & Baker, both of whom lived at Port Augusta at the time.  All the trustees are now dead except for Mr William Davey who is the original trustee and who helped did the foundation for the building, and Mr John Snell who was elected later and acted as Sunday school superintendent for many years.

W.J. Davey of the Record Studio was on the scene by special appointment and took several pictures.  Numbers 1 & 2 show workmen drilling holes for the dynamite.

Number 3 shows the smoke of the explosion with no effective result.

Number 4 shows the wall in the act of falling which can be traced in various movements from the building to the ground.  The apparatus fixed to the camera for this purpose was the work of and design of the operator.  These pictures are for sale at the Record.
