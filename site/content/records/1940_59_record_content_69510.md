Booborowie and Leighton Secession

It is clear that the proposed secession is due entirely to poor roads.  But poor roads are found in the whole of the Burra District, which lacks regular patrols and grading.

Noel G. Tiver, formerly of the Hallett DC writes blaming the change twenty years earlier that wiped out the Booborowie Council.  At the time the Burra Council acquired all the assets.  Burra did not make any money on the deal, but got all the plant, though later a grader was handed over to Hallett.  The compact nature of Booborowie with its larger income made Booborowie a viable council and this problem would not then have arisen.

The Leighton Demarcation Line was fixed at a meeting of about 30 ratepayers at Leighton Hall on Thursday night.  The motion was that the whole of Leighton Ward except the portion bounded by the road running north from Ironmine Church to Earleâ€™s Corner and then east to the Burra-Booborowie Road and between sections 888 & 889 to the eastern boundary of the Ward, be transferred from Burra Burra DC to Spalding DC, with the western boundary [road] remaining with Burra and the northern boundary [road] going to Spalding.  Carried without dissent.

The petition will also call for the transfer of the portion of road between the Leighton School and the Church, presently in Hanson Ward, to go to the Spalding section of Leighton Ward and a similar deviation in the southwest corner by section 580 also be included in the area to be ceded.

The petition will be prepared and circulated once the four ratepayers who are to represent the wards on the Spalding Council have been nominated/elected.
