Burra Burra DC Ratepayers’ Meeting

At a meeting of ratepayers held in Booborowie on Thursday a majority supported the move to transfer Booborowie and Leighton Wards to the Spalding DC.  About 100 people attended.  The Council was represented by District Clerk, T.G. Perry, and Mr E. McWaters.  Spalding DC was represented by Mr K. Trengove and District Clerk, Mr C. Swan.  A.W. Pearce took the chair.  He said the meeting was called because it was thought roads in the two council wards compared most unfavourably with those in the adjoining area of Spalding and it appeared that Spalding with its smaller road mileage would be better able to improve and maintain roads in the two wards.

Mr Carmody presented the case for the transfer:

BBDC covers 840 square miles with 123 miles of main roads.

Spalding DC covers 225 square miles with 24 miles of main roads.

The two wards concerned have 40 miles of main roads.

Last year Burra received a Highways grant of £10,000.

Spalding received one of £6,000.

For the Burra-Andrews Road Burra received £1,000 for 19 miles and Spalding £1,000 for its 7 miles.

Booborowie and Leighton paid one third of the rates, but were not receiving a similar proportion of the expenditure.

In a Spalding Council the two wards would get four out of eight Councillors, while in Burra they has two out of eight.

It was understood Spalding would station a plant in Booborowie to eliminate wasted travel time.

Mr Perry then quoted the actual amounts spent by his Council and Mr McWaters suggested that area alone was not a true comparison.
