Burra Branch of the National Trust of SA: Letter to the Editor

Burra is a unique town and this is often more apparent to visitors than to the locals.  Its history lies not so much in written records as in its buildings and walls, its Cornish cottages and its place names.  [A discussion of some of these places then follows.]

The National Trust Branch was formed because a number of people felt that the preservation of Burraâ€™s fascinating past could not much longer be left merely to chance, especially with the possibility of renewed mining and the expansion which could result.  Items of historical interest are scattered in homes and sheds and are hidden in places where they could be forgotten.  The Trust aims to collect such items and to house them in a proper building where they can be preserved and made available to all our people, visitors and tourists and to our children as a record that can be seen and touched.  Other towns in SA with a much smaller role in the history of the state have begun to preserve their past and we are sure the people of Burra and District will also want to preserve their own history.

If there is a symbol of Burra it surely is Johnny Green.

Your donation can help our efforts to do this, whether with money or historical items.  The aim is to raise $1,600 to set up the museum.
