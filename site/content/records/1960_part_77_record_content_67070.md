11 Hearing Impaired Students from Erindale Speech and Hearing Centre visited Burra for a two day Social Studies Survey Camp and they stayed in Paxton Square.

A similar group from Woodville Speech and Hearing Centre visited earlier in the year.  The recent visitors went to Waters’ Bakery, various churches, the Courthouse (to see old records), the Reformatory [Redruth Gaol], the school, the telephone exchange, the Burra Record office and to see shearing at Farrell Flat.
