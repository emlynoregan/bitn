Burra Mine

Work at the mine so far has been of a preparatory nature.  De-watering of the open cut will start some time in June 1973, or perhaps in the following year.  The water level will probably be lowered to 1,540 ft above sea level or 60 ft below the present level and would not then be lowered further for two years.  Once started, pumping will continue for the life of the operation.  The equipment will be capable of handling 1,000 gallons per minute.  Notification of the decision to commence pumping will be given in due course.
