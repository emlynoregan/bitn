Market Square Proposal

Plans for changes to the square displayed on Saturday morning offered three alternatives:

Leave it as it is.

Return to a design where cars run right past the shops.

A design with a double row of parking around the curve of the shops, with the north bound lane removed and the south bound lane converted to a two-way flow.

Option three seemed to get more approval than the other two.

An extract from the Burra Record of 16 June 1909 that was printed alongside this article revealed that the 1909 proposal for a central triangular garden with a rotunda was disapproved of by a large section of ratepayers.

Vandalism at the public toilets in Market Street and in the barbecue area caused about $200 damage.
