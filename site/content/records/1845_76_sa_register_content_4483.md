Government Land Sale

[The editorial condemns the decision of Governor Robe to refuse a Special Survey of 20,000 acres on Emu Flats.  This would have yielded £20,000 for the Government.  As a consequence the land was subdivided and just the best sections sold for perhaps £5,257-11-0.  Yesterday 7,472 acres were sold for £9,996-9-0.  This leaves thousands of acres unappropriated, which must have been included in a special survey.]
