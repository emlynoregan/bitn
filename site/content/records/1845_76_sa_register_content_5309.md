Oddfellows at Kooringa.  The completion of the extensive new building attached to the Burra Burra Hotel was celebrated by members of the Burra Burra Lodge of Oddfellows MU by a dinner last Thursday.  Over 100 persons attended, including most of the principal citizens.  The enterprise of the proprietor of the hotel in erecting such an extensive and costly building is praiseworthy.  It exceeds anything in the colony and provides a venue calculated to promote harmony and conviviality in a town destitute of social amusement.  The main room measures 60 feet by 37 feet and is 18 ft high.  There are also other smaller rooms and an extensive range of rooms on the basement.  The room was designed principally for the Burra Burra Lodge of Oddfellows, whose increasing numbers required larger accommodation than was available in Kooringa.  The building is in the splendid local stone and is calculated to strike the stranger on his entrance into the town. We were favoured with a preview of the interior.  The splendid main hall recalled ‘The Albion’, ‘Freemasons’ Hall’ and other celebrated taverns in London.  The dinner embraced all the delicacies of the season and showed the greatest care in its preparation.  Mr Paxton had been invited to chair the gathering, but in his absence Mr Mortlock filled that position.  A ball was held the following evening.
