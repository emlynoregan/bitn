Cheryl Day has received news of the cancellation of the Athletics Tour to America, just 16 days before departure.  The organiser of the tour has received threatened legal action against him taking athletes to America.  There are some moves to arrange an alternative trip in July.  If this does not eventuate donations will be refunded where possible and money from raffles and the trading table will be left in a trust account and its disposal decided at a later date.
