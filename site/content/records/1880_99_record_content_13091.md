Chrysanthemum Show in the Institute last Wednesday was a great success.  Takings in aid of the Institute came to £9.  There were a large number of exhibitors.  Dr Sangster and Mr Packard were judges.  There were no money prizes, but awards were presented.  To give some variety awards were also made for 6, 12 & 24 cuts of any flowers.  Of the chrysanthemums, splendid entries came from Mr Lasscock and Mr Drew.  There were also 84 hand bouquets made by students from the Burra Model School.  The major contenders were: Mrs Cave, J.D. Cave, M. Rayner, Dr Brummitt, T. Drew, C. Drew, F.W. Holder, C. Oppermann, Ambrose Harris, W. Lasscock, Miss Lewis and C. Schutz.
