Soldiers’ Aid Society last week made 260 sandbags to bring the stock to over 300 and a bale of them will soon be sent off.  The Adelaide Committee aims for 100,000 bags.  Burra Coronation Band will give a concert in the reserve by R.D. Pascoe’s shop Aberdeen [Best Place].  The fund stands at £96-13-0.
