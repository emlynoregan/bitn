Accident.  A semi-trailer transporting an eighteen-ton crane unit lost its load four miles east of Burra on the Morgan Road on Sunday.  The vehicle was driven by Mr Franz Mattasch and was going from Perth to Melbourne.  The Council grader and two heavy jacks were used to assist in putting the unit back onto its wheels.  Both the tray of the semi and the crane sustained considerable damage.
