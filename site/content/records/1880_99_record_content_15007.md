Colonel Downes has reported to the Government on the Rifle Volunteer Force ‘as little better, if at all so, than a shooting club, on a large scale.’  It has the added disadvantage of giving a false sense of security.

His remarks have provoked much dissension and a soldier writer says the Adelaide Rifles [i.e. the paid military force of the day] should be included in the strictures.  He says the officers are ignorant and can’t maintain discipline, and the whole force is little better than ‘an armed and well dressed mob’. 

Furthermore Downes’s anticipated retirement in June next ‘will not evoke a very violent outburst of grief’. 

Silverton Railway.  The Bill for the railway from Petersburg began its passage through Parliament, but the debate has been adjourned.
