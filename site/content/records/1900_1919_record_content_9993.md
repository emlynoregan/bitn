Salvation Army.  Captain & Mrs Ross write to thank those who billeted the Austral Guards on their recent visit.

The Austral Guards Band arrived Thursday by the Broken Hill Express and made their way to the Barracks for a sumptuous spread after which they rested after their tiring journey.  They then had two hours practice in the afternoon before meeting at the Royal Exchange Hotel and marching to the Barracks, playing throughout. The Thunderer March was greatly appreciated.  At the Barracks they entered and began a fine performance which is reported upon item by item.  On Friday afternoon the band played on several occasions in Market Square in aid of the Burra Hospital and raised over Â£6.  They left for Riverton by the afternoon train.
