Mr C. Radford, who is a returned soldier from the Middle East & New Guinea, has been appointed curator of the cemetery.  He is also a qualified monumental mason.  He begins in January 1945 and will be paid Â£52 p.a. to keep the cemetery in good order.  He will get all the fees for digging graves and may charge for attending to individual graves and erecting and repairing tombstones.  This will not impinge on current council employees who have as much work as they can handle.
