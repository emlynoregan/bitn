Letter.  Avian Pink writes re proposed changes to the constitution of Burra traders’ Association, aimed at widening its parameters to include tourism.

Regardless of the tourism issue the constitution need updating.

If adopted the change would simply place tourism matters on the same level as business, commerce and industry and broaden the membership base.

Burra would have one strong association to liaise with the Council and the National Trust.

If the Traders’ Association stays unchanged then the growing interaction at local, state and national levels in business, commerce and tourism development will not be serviced adequately.
