Stop Industrial Wind Farms (SIWF), the local protest group, is outraged by the SA Governmentâ€™s changes to the development assessment process.  The former process led to a successful appeal in the Environment, Resources and Development Court, against the Allendale Wind Farm.  On 19 October the Government changed the rules for assessing wind farm proposals.  Ms Ally Fricker for SIWF said it was clear the Government never had any intention that appeals could succeed and so have changed the rules so that there can be continued development of wind farms without the hindrance of community opposition through third party appeals.  The changes have been made to give greater certainty to the industry, but have delivered greater uncertainty to thousands of people across rural SA.

Setbacks of one kilometre from homes and two kilometres from towns make a mockery of protection from noise impacts or loss of visual amenity and give no consideration to wild life.  Councils will no longer be obliged to notify the public of impending developments; only adjoining landowners need be notified.
