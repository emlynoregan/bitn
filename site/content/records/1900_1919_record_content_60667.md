Burra Cheer-up Soc.

The Ladies’ band had a miserable start to Adelaide Violet Day on 20 June.  The day in Burra was cold and wet and the train ran 1½ hours late, not reaching Adelaide till 11.30 a.m., but there the weather was perfect.  The band had, unexpectedly and unrehearsed, to play at the Anzac Arch at noon, as the Naval Band was unable to do so due to influenza among them.  Then came a luncheon at the Cheer-up Hut.  At 1.45 p.m. Major Cooke-Russell led the band up King William St and back to Bowman’s Arcade, where a number was played while the public threw money onto a flag some soldiers were carrying.  On turning from King William St towards the Cheer-up Hut they were greeted by hundreds of interstate soldiers who were passing through Adelaide.  The girls then crowded into the Hut along with hundreds of soldiers, to be presented with service stripes by Brigadier-General Antrill.  Afternoon tea followed, after which there was another parade, this time combined with the Military Band – mounted police being needed to clear a way through the traffic.

Tpr Horace Hill writes from Beersheba about a trip to Cairo and back by car and train as well as of other activities in Palestine.
