Burra Burra Copper Co. held its 17th half-yearly meeting in Adelaide on Friday.  Nothing has been done by the Burra Burra Copper Company at Burra since the evaporation of the Horne Syndicate.  A few men have been getting a little on tribute, but do not like the way their efforts are being treated and at present very little is being done.
