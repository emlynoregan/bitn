‘A Wanderer’ attacks Cr Ridgway and Cr Anderson over the inspectorship issue.

Cr Ridgway says the Council’s agreements with the Inspector are legally and morally binding, but as an illegal transaction was entered into with his assistance he seems to ignore all principle.

Cr Anderson repudiates a move he would say saved only £16, but then moved an amendment that would save only £8.

‘Wanderer’ trusts that voters will remember the lack of principle when it comes to an election.
