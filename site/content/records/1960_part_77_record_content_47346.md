Bowls.  The 1968-69 Burra Bowls season was summed up by the club President Mr M.G. Stockman in c. 1Â¼ columns.  Shades at the greens had been improved.  The outside of the clubhouse and the seats and forms had been painted.  The Mayor E.T. Baulderstone opened the season.  The Club Championship was won by Bill Corner.  The Easter Tournament was a great success.  The Associates were again a great help to the club and made a nice donation of $391.  The greens were kept in excellent condition.
