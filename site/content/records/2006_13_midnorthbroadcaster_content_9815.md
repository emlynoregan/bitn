Gum Hill Stud.  The Lines family of Gum Hill Stud was recognised at the SA Stud Merino Field Days last Monday for their milestone of 125 years of breeding quality Merinos.  The on property display attracted about 80 local and interstate visitors.  The Stud has bases in Mt Bryan with senior principal Glan Lines and at Keith with son Justin and brother Haydn.  The stud was established at Yarcowie in 1885 by John Ayers Lines with son George Glanville Lines later transferring the stud to Mt Bryan in 1916.  Rail transport was then booming and rams were easily distributed to many wool growing areas.  In 1926 George acquired land near Booborowie, which had been part of the Old Canowie Station.  In 1946 Lance Lines, an industrial chemist by profession, took over the running of Gum Hill where the interest in measuring wool and meat saw a new stud policy evolve – let the sheep stand up [to] the rigours of nature.  Feed efficiency trials at Waite institute in the 1980s showed Gum Hill’s sheep out performed other SA sheep.
