Fire.  A second fire within a week has affected Koonoona.  This one is believed to have been started by a match or cigarette butt from a passing vehicle.  It started about seven miles south of Burra on the main Adelaide Road and was noticed by Jeff Neale of the Burra Motor Co. at about 3 p.m.  He and the occupants of another car tried to extinguish the flames, but without success.  Mr R.E. Mason of Koo-owie raised the alarm in Burra.  It was controlled by about 5 p.m. after burning about 200 acres of sparsely grassed land.
