Burra Hospital has decided to approach the Prices Commission for permission to raise patientsâ€™ fees for Ward Patients and for those occupying private rooms.    This has been brought about by a substantial rise in salaries for both nurses and domestic staff.

The staff shortage at the hospital means that the Medical Officer has been requested to admit only surgical and urgent medical cases and persons who can be cared for by relatives or at home will not be admitted until further notice.
