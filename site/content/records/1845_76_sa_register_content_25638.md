Kooringa Flour Mill.  Ten years ago the idea of a flour mill at Burra would have been thought ludicrous.  Now Mt john Roach of Penwortham has completed the purchase of a site from the SAMA in a central position between Kooringa and Redruth-Aberdeen and apparently intends to start building at once, having already got some material carted to the spot.
