Burra Creek Ores

Portions of ores of the main northern lodes at Burra Creek have been tested by Messrs Elphick and Davey.  The ores (nearly all red oxide) tested by Mr Elphick yielded 71¼%, 960 grains of ore leaving 685 grains of pure metal.  Dr Davey’s sample of green copper, red copper and a yellowish substance produced 63½% copper.  Men have been sent up with four drays and a quantity is expected in Adelaide in the course of the next week.

[Bon Accord]

We have reason to believe another Special Survey will be taken shortly northwards from the north end of the Burra Creek Survey.
