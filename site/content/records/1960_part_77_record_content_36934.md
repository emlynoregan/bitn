Burra Hospital: Work begins on Phase III

Local contractors, Hirschausen Bros., M.G. Wardle and D.T. Jacka & Co., are demolishing the old hotel building.

Mr Ian Auhl has delved into the history of the building.  Ninety years ago on Tuesday 27 February 1877 rain and nature seemed determined to upset the arrangements of humanity.  A half holiday had been declared and the town was looking forward to a day of celebration with ‘a grand blow-out’ to follow and a concert in the new Institute at night.  Eminent visitors arrived by train the night before for the double event of the opening of the Burra Hospital and the laying of the foundation stone of the new Model School. The old Burra Hotel had been acquired from the SA Mining Association ‘on very generous terms’.  It had been renovated and painted and a Wardsman and Matron, Mr Wright Heath and his wife, had been appointed at a combined salary of £100 with rations and accommodation.  The hotel had been erected in 1849, taking the placed of a wooden one on the same site in 1847.  In 1849 it was known as Wren’s Hotel and was the largest in SA.  It was owned by Mr Paxton who also owned, like a good Mine Director, the four inns in Kooringa.  The Burra Burra Hotel was the first encountered on entering the town and was patronised by the ‘quality’ and always used by the Mine Directors on their visits to the Burra Burra Mine.  Attached to it was a very spacious room 50 ft by 30 ft and 15 ft high, which had been more particularly built as a Freemason’s Hall, it being the largest room in the colony.  The spacious cellars held a large supply of wine, liquors and other tavern stores from Burra Directors’ Port to hams, loaf sugar, pewter pots, glass and crockery.  In this hall were held all the public and political meetings of the day and all the major functions of the town.  The hotel with its shingle roof closed as a hotel in the year before it opened as a hospital.  Now ninety years later it is being demolished to make way for a new wing of the hospital and for a few days its shingle roof was again exposed when the iron was removed.  There are few 120-year-old buildings as well preserved as this one.  Its cellars are still there.
