Weather.  A severe weather warning was issued for Wednesday last.  An alert for the Burra, Hanson, Farrell Flat, Koonoona and Gum Creek area predicted wild wind and lightning.  Hanson farmer Dennis Short was out attending to one of four fires caused by lightning strikes in the Gum Creek area when a wild wind gust tore through his property, destroying an implement shed.  The gust was a mini tornado.  Torrential rain fell in a confined area near Hanson, while Farrell Flat area was dry with fires.  Most tornados in SA occur in the winter months and generally closer to the coast.
