Mrs T. Sandland & Miss Elsie Sandland were farewelled at the Cheer-up room on Wednesday afternoon.  Mrs Sandland was presented with a handsome aquamarine pendant and Miss Sandland with a silver handbag.  Mrs Sandland could not leave Burra after 27 years without many regrets.  She will be much missed by the Womenâ€™s Branch of the Liberal Union, of which she was the President.  She was also active in the Red Cross and the Benevolent Soc.
