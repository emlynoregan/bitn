Kooringa News, 11 December

The Mine has ceased taking in timber and firewood and so the townâ€™s streets are quiet.

There is some dissatisfaction over aspects of the Waste Lands Regulations as a result of the Crown Lands Ranger nabbing a mob of cattle found on Crown Land.  Their owners were forthwith indicted for trespass and a number of the cases are to be heard tomorrow.
