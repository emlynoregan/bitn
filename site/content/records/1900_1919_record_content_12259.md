Thomas Best writes to correct Dr Sangster’s writing about the Burra Mine in the Register.  The engine started in 1854 was Gender’s and not Morphett’s, which only came to Burra in 1859.  He remembers passing Mr Woollacott’s teams a mile or so the other side of Smithfield while on the way to Pt Adelaide with a load of copper.  The big wagon had the ‘bob’ of the engine on board and it was drawn by the largest team of bullocks probably ever seen in Australia: 42 or 44 arranged four abreast with two leaders.  All bridges on the way had to be propped including the small one this side of Hamilton.  Like Dr Sangster Best felt it was time something definite was done before all the shareholders’ money was dribbled away with nothing to show.
