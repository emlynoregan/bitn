Burra’s Pageant

Mr Ken Dawson (Secretary) and a committee arranged a pageant to precede the big sports meeting at Aberdeen Oval.  Burra’s prize-winning Floral Float was a star attraction.  The Burra Pioneer’s Float also took part, with its cargo of quaintly-dressed miners and their wives and with a wurlie in the foreground.  The procession started at the Burra Hospital except for the two floral floats – they would not fit under the archway erected at Lewis’s Bridge.  The procession featured:

Master Ken Kellaway (14) as Governor Hindmarsh

Mr Jack Allen as John Bull

The Burra Brass Band under Bandmaster Murison

A white gondola fashioned by Jack Terry
