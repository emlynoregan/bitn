Obituary.  Dr William Peel Nesbitt died at Salisbury on 12 May, aged 44.  He was the son of Dr Pearce R. Nesbitt and was born at Northampton on 3 June 1849.  He was educated at Bruce castle near London, Guy’s Hospital and Edinburgh University, during which time the disease which has now claimed him first appeared.  He was a Bachelor of Medicine and Master of Surgery.  He visited South Africa, America and New Zealand before coming to Burra in 1875 and stayed here five years.  In his time here he was a Warden of St Mary’s, President of the Institute, Member of the School Board of Advice and Mayor for a year.  With Dr Brummitt he worked to establish the Burra Hospital and was one of its first two medical officers.  He left Burra in 1880 for a North Adelaide practice and was given an address and silver plate in appreciation when he left.  He was an Honorary Medical Officer at the Children’s Hospital and for a time a Resident Medical Officer there.  He later became Medical Officer for Yatala Labour Prison, but had to retire due to illness 6-8 months ago.  For the last 18-19 years he lived with his sister, Miss Nesbitt.
