Burra Town Council

The English & Australian Copper Co. replied re dangerous walls: that they were only dangerous to trespassers.

The Institute Committee said the extra fire escape doors were being attended to.

The Town Clerk reported rates collected £394-17-7 with c. £30 owing.  Government subsidy was £107 and dog licences £10.

After the meeting there would be a bank overdraft of £65.

He said allocating 75% of the general rate to the wards was too much.
