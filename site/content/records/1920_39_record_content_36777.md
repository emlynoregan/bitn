Burra Water Supply

The Public Works Standing Committee has expressed concern to the Council that the Burra Scheme is running at a loss. Present rates in country areas are:

Up to an assessed annual value of £200: 9%

Over £200 to £400: 6%

Over £400: 3%

There is a minimum annual charge of 20/- for tenements and 3/- for vacant land.

[Figures are also cited for country lands from 4d to 7d per acre depending on unimproved value.]

Since 1927 all water rates have been increased by a surcharge of 25%.

Since July 1929 the charge for rebate water was 1/8 per 1,000 gallons and 1/- per 1,000 gallons for excess.

Burra figures are then printed for the years from 1926-30.  Capital cost was £21,865-18-2.  Interest was £1,084-4-11, working expenses £1,881-4-6.  Revenue was £2,068-3-8 for a loss of £897-5-9.  The accumulated loss since inception was £6,942-1-8.  The committee asks the Council for suggestions.
