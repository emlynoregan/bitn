D.R. Jones, labourer of Redruth, was fined a total of Â£3 for not sending his children to school as required.  The JPs felt he was unfairly dealt with by the Education Department which had waited nearly six months to bring the case, during which time the children had been attending regularly.  They could not reduce the penalty, but waived hearing fees.
