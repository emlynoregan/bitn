William Develaing was charged with being drunk while in management of the Royal Exchange Hotel, Aberdeen.

Thomas Halls gave evidence of Develaing’s drunken state and of a scuffle between him and Halls.  The defendant had abused the witness, calling him an informer and a scoundrel.

Henry Cox, a drover, corroborated Halls story.

M-C George Innes saw the scuffle and the defendant was the worse for drink.

The defendant had given Halls in charge, but did not later come to sign the complaint and refused to prosecute.

William Develaing denied that he pulled Halls into the bar, but said words arose because he had refused to serve beer to Alf Schutz who was a prohibited person.  Halls had rushed down the bar and tried to choke him and in the struggle Develaing’s shoulder had been dislocated.  He was not drunk.

Morris Rabbich described the assault, but did not think the defendant was ‘uproariously tight’.

Develaing was convicted and fined £2 plus 10/- costs.
