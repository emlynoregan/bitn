Weather.  A storm on the night of 2 & 3 September began with rain from c. 11 p.m. which continued in torrents throughout the night.  By Saturday morning the Burra Creek was flowing strongly and by 2 p.m. was the highest for 20 years.  The Pig and Whistle footbridge was washed away and a boy who was foolishly about to cross had a lucky escape.  About half the footbridge behind the Burra Hotel was swept away.  In Aberdeen the waters covered almost the whole of the new oval and much of the country to Mt Bryan was flooded with all traffic suspended.  The footbridge at the White Hart was covered and water lapped the doors of Messrs Reed & Gully, but the level soon subsided.

The heavy falls also extended to the east.

At Mt Bryan by the church the flood was over a mile wide.
