Burra Golf Club.  Three weeks ago when Clare visited Burra to play off the first round of the Mid-North Group Competitions Burra won 3 of the 5 games.  On Saturday when visiting Clare Burra hoped to win two and halve one at least, but they only succeeded in the ‘halving’ and will have to wait till next season for another attempt.
