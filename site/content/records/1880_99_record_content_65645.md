Kooringa Wesleyan Circuit Quarterly Meeting on 27 December reported a small drop in membership and a circuit debt of £36.

Arrangements were made for the Kooringa & World’s End Sunday Schools’ Anniversaries.  Readjustments of the local circuit will not be pressed on the Conference for 1899 as the immediate reasons for such no longer apply and 1900 will be a better opportunity.
