Colleen Spackman was heard to say that she wished she had a wooden reindeer for display at Christmas Time.  Ron Christie got to work at the Burra Men’s Shed and produced a fine version in laminated MDF.  He said ‘Colleen does a lot for the community.’  The work extended over some six weeks and 25-30 hours and the result was a magnificent ‘Woodolf’ the wooden reindeer.
