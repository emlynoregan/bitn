Mrs W.J. McBride leaves Burra this week after an almost life-long residence in the town.  The large photo of the Burra Cheer-Up Girls who formed a mounted escort for Governor Sir Henry Galway on 13 October 1915 which hangs in the Burra Institute was a gift of Mrs McBride.  She was a staunch supporter of the Redruth Methodist Church and the Aberdeen Croquet Club.
