King Edward VII Memorial.  A meeting was held in the Council Chamber last Friday evening, but unfortunately only one sketch of the proposal was submitted.  We hope the public and subscribers will get the worth of their money and ‘a monument of beauty and not one of a public nuisance.’  We fear if the ‘sketch’ is not considerably altered the latter will be the case.
