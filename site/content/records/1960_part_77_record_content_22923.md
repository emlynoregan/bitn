Mrs Alice Peak & Miss Gertrude Williams attended the hospital opening and reported on Nurse Catherine Watson, who was the first fully trained nurse at the Burra Hospital.  She came from England on the Oaklands in 1876 as a nurse, attending on one of the passengers.  She had intended to return, but instead agreed to go to Burra.  She found conditions primitive at the converted hotel that was the hospital.  Her first meal was on the end of the kitchen table, from a tin plate and pannikin, while the cook did the washing up at the other end.  She soon managed to introduce china for staff and patients.  Rubbish was emptied into a disused shaft on the grounds.  She was bothered by the continuous noise from the ore crushers, but the mines closed down soon after she arrived.  Equipment was minimal and at least one man’s leg was amputated using the meat saw from the kitchen.  Operations were performed on the counter of the old bar.  A typhoid epidemic struck while the railway was being extended to Terowie and so many patients arrived that they had to be accommodated on the floor of the old bar.  The cook had no idea of an invalid diet and provided a thick Scotch broth for the typhoid patients.  Nurse Watson sent the orderly to fetch the doctor.  The orderly was Mr William Wilson, who had resigned from the Police Department and helped Nurse Watson with the male patients.  He held the position for about 20 years until retiring.  Changes came gradually.  The bar was converted to a Women’s Ward.  The long room became the Men’s Ward.  The smaller rooms were assigned to domestic uses.  After two years Nurse Watson decided not to return to the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, where she had been trained.  She married C.C. Williams.  Soon after this the Hospital purchased its first surgical instruments and Dr Brummitt came and took her to see them.  She was delighted at this advance in the treatment of the sick.
