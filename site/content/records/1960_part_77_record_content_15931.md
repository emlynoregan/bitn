Mid North High Schools Combined Sports were held at Balaklava on Thursday.  Burra with a total of 147 points won both the Championship and the handicap sections – perhaps for the first time since the five schools have competed.  Rules prevent the same school from receiving both shields in the same year, so the Handicap Shield was awarded to the runner-up, Kapunda.

A. Thomas of Burra broke to 440 yards record.

In the Intermediate Girls’ 220 yards H. Angel broke the record.
