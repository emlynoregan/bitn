Midland Road Board.

The surveyor’s report on the Main Street in Kooringa opposite the Post Office etc. was presented.  The average depth of metal was not over 6” with about 1½” blinding of clay slate gravel (mostly reduced by the traffic to clay.)  The road was badly formed and the metal used for coating it was inferior and the road needed a coat of 8” of 2½” metal before it could pass.  Funds were then available to complete the work.  The Town Clerk and Surveyor of the Town Council admitted that the specifications called for only 4” of 2½” top metal and so could not see how the contractor could be forced to do more as I required.  (The Mayor agreed.)

On 10 May the council promised no more would be paid to the contractor until the proper quantity of metal was on the road.  The Mayor reported on 27 July that the road and alterations were complete.  I report the road formation and depth is practically the same as on 5 May when I complained of its state.

Captain Killicoat said the Mayor had told him the work was complete and that the Govt. had paid over the balance of the £400 vote after sending a special surveyor who had reported it as satisfactory.  The Council had much improved the road, though he could say nothing about the metal.  He suggested the Board visit the road when in Burra shortly.

The Chairman said that if the Board had confidence in their surveyor they were bound to accept his report.  Mr Kelly said that regardless of whether the money was spent or not the Corporation was bound by their agreement to see the road constructed to the satisfaction of the Board Surveyor.  The Board ordered the road to be finished to the satisfaction of the surveyor as agreed.

The surveyor recommended against altering the fence at the approach to the bridge near Fore St in Redruth.
