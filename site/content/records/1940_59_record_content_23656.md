The Burra Centenary Celebrations were a great success.  They were the culmination of months of hard work by committees and conveners.  A huge part was played by the Ladies’ Committee as well and by a large range of individuals throughout the town and district.

Mr Essington Lewis officially opened the Centenary Celebrations.

Splendid weather prevailed when Mr Essington Lewis, Chief General Manager of BHP Ltd attended and declared the celebrations officially open on Wednesday last.  Market Square was crowded for the occasion and gay with decorations.  The Mayor introduced Mr Lewis and presented a brief history of the town in doing so.

Mr Lewis expressed his pleasure in being able to be present and recalled Burra in the days of his boyhood.  He also spoke of the town’s mining heritage, but also of WWI and then the lead-up to WWII and his role in it.  He hoped that the leaders of today would recognise the need to win the peace as they had won the war and that they would retain sufficient of their wartime capacity to defend Australia in any future war.  He congratulated Burra on its progress in the last 100 years and said that if anything would stand by the country in the future it was hard work.  He congratulated the centenary Committee and declared the whole event officially open.

Mr Woollacott also congratulated the Committee and apologised for the absence of the Mayoress, who was too sick to attend.  He introduced his two daughters-in-law, widows of the late Noel and Roy Woollacott (killed in action) and invited them to assist Mrs E.F. Marston, (daughter of the first Mayor of Burra, Philip Lane Esq.) to cut the Centenary Cake.

This four tier cake was decorated with 100 candles and it was cut into pieces and distributed to those present.  Pieces were preserved for patients at the Hospital and for members of the SA Police Band.

Afternoon tea was served in the Farmers’ Union Building, convened by Mrs J. Kellock and Mrs W.J. Lee, assisted by members of the Ladies’ Committee.  A beautiful afternoon tea of cakes and dainties was provided for about 300 people.

Mr Essington Lewis was welcomed to Burra at the Town Hall on Wednesday.  Prior to the public meeting in the hall, the Mayor introduced Mr Lewis to the members of the Centenary Committee in the Council Chamber.  The Town Clerk Mr E.J. Davey said he had been in the town for three quarters of a century and had attended the local school as a boy with Mr Lewis.

[Given that E.J. Davey was born in 1869 and Essington Lewis in 1881, this claim seems unlikely to be true.]

The Mayor welcome Mr Lewis and all the old Burraites who had returned for the celebrations.

Cr Kellaway, as senior town councillor, also welcomed Mr Lewis.

The Town Clerk then presented Mr Lewis with a beautifully made paperweight, crafted from Burra malachite that had been donated by Mr R.D. Pascoe.

Mr Lewis then responded.
