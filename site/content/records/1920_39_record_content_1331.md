Burra Show Society met on Friday with M. Radford presiding.  Four questions were considered:

Should the show move from the end of October to the end of September?  Originally September had been too early for horses, but they had now given way to cars etc. and October was too late for sheep.  Mr Winnall said first you had to decide what sort of show you wanted.  If it was to combine sheep and a general show it would have to be earlier.  Mr McLaren thought the end of September was not too late for sheep and Thomas McWaters also was in favour of combining the two shows, but thought the first week in October was a possibility.  James Flower thought a change back to September a mistake and F. Duldig thought the shows were held too late.  A date of 6 October was eventually agreed on.

Should the sheep and general shows be combined and should the sheep section be made competitive?  After discussion it was agreed to do both these.

A letter from Burra Sports Syndicate asked that the show ring and jumps be moved to their original position, as the present area would soon be needed for polo.

Also improvements for the Burra Racing Club and Sports Syndicate required the Show fowl coops be moved nearer the creek at the Syndicate’s cost – Agreed.

The publican’s booth is also to be moved.
