Letter from Elizabeth Ann Ward of Hill St defending the reputation of Lindsay Kemble.  He is not disreputable, nor idle nor disorderly.  In Burra, and until the war started, he was in a vaudeville company which he had to leave due to severe pneumonia.  He left Burra with the Tom Thumb Co.  The masquerade that landed him in trouble was an exceedingly clever joke and by no means as disgraceful as it appeared to be.  [Lindsayâ€™s later career with some reference to this incident appears in the papers for 3 Sep. 1919, 31 Mar. 1920 and 14 July 1920.]
