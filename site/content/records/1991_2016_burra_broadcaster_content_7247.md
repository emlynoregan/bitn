The South Australian Police Choir held a performance at the Old Courthouse on Saturday night before a capacity house of 85.  They presented a broad range of songs.  Early on Sunday morning they went to the Uniting Church and sang and spoke to the Sunday school children.  They went on to the Anglican Church, where a crowd of 150 enjoyed their contribution to the service.  The choir had lunch at the Burra Hospital and then treated residents to a special performance.
