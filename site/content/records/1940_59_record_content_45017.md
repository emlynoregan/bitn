Burra Town Council, 20 March

The Council has been invited to the 21st anniversary celebrations of the Aberdeen Croquet Club.

The War Memorial Committee advised that work on Victoria Park would soon commence and asked permission to cut the present dressing shed in half and to use the removed material to cover the open part of the existing shed.  This would allow the cycle track to be completed.  Permission granted.

P.V. Oates was given permission to enclose his verandah.  [Corner of East & Quarry Streets.]

H.O. Pederick, headmaster of Burra School, asked the Council to construct a road from the school to the top of the hill, as the existing road was too rough for the school bus and the pick-up point by the Drill Hall was too far away for supervision.  He asked for the repair of the road from the school to the saleyards.  The Council will hold an inspection.

The Overseer reported, among other work, that the new tennis court at Aberdeen is about half finished.
