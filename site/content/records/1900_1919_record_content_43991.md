Copperhouse School visiting day was last Friday.  The inspectors report presents the school in a most favourable light.  The monitor, Miss Brenda Edwards, got 95% for her junior and first classes.  The head teacher, Mr Mazzarol introduced the Mayor who was invited to unveil a photograph of the late Pte John Camp, who was a former scholar at Copperhouse.  Among other things there was an exhibition of flag signalling by the boys.  The report extends for 1 column.
