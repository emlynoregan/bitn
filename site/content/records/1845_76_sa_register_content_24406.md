Board of Education.  At the meeting of the Board on 29 January Mr Hartley moved that it was desirable that a public elementary school be erected on the site already secured by the Board.  Though there were free schools in the city, their continuance was not guaranteed and depended on money being raised by people and a lady who collected for them had said she had great difficulty in collecting funds.  The funding of one large school would be much more efficient than spreading it among five schools.  He said it was clear that the worst prepared scholars came from the very small schools.  The site secured was at the corner of Grote and Brown Streets.  [Brown Street is now called Morphett Street.]  It could serve the whole of the west side of the city.  Two schools in Morphett Street, two in Gilbert Street and one in Gouger Street could then be dispensed with.  Mr Hardy said the Board had pursued this idea for 15 years.  He urged an amendment to the effect that the Board urge upon the Government the necessity of proving the funding for an elementary school to be erected on the site purchased.  Mr Hartley agreed to the amendment.  Money (Â£2,000) had been voted in 1867, but had never been received.
