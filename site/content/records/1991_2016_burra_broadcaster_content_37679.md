Goyder Council has not reacted to the 400-name petition tabled at its last meeting, asking that the plans for Market Square not go ahead.  However, in the most recent Council update it has said:

‘In general we are prepared only at this time to make minor amendments in harmony with the original (concept plan) in accordance with public consultation.’

The consultants have been briefed on the feelings of some of the local community and have offered to manage a public workshop on the Council’s behalf.

‘…while some members of the community are not prepared to accept the changes, others are more than happy that the sites and Burra will get a well needed face-lift, while maintaining the integrity of the heritage town.’

It is expected the basic design plans will be completed on 28 November.
