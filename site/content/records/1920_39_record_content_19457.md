Burra Town Council, 3 May

Drew & Crewes sought permission for the erection of a second bowser.  The work had been done on 21 April and the letter was received on 23 April.  Cr Woollacott explained the circumstances which he thought justified their action, but Cr Kellaway thought they should be reprimanded as a matter of principle and not to set a precedent.  Permission was granted and a letter setting out the error was to be sent.

Crs Riggs & Allen reported that the Council’s road-tarring appliances were out of date.

Burra Athletic Club is to be allowed to spend £15 improving the track at Victoria Park.

Discussion about the guns was again deferred until next meeting.

A long list of minor works was attended to.
