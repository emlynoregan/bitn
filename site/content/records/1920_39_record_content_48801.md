Mr W. Beale of Wentworth NSW visited recently and claims his grandfather J. Beal erected the figure of Johnny Green if he did not make it.  Like many another old Burra resident he is almost certain Johnny Green is not the correct name.  Mr Beal’s father, Johnny Beal worked for a number of years for John Pearce, builder of Kooringa.
