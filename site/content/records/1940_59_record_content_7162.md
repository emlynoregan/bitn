Burra Red Cross Flower Stall was open for the first time this season on 29 August.  It was held in the shop once known as Spencer’s – kindly lent by Mr Drew.  The flowers were a beautiful selection, mostly from out of Burra.  They included a lovely range of sweet peas, stocks, pansies, violets and marigolds and some Sturt peas.  There was also butter to sell and lemons.

The stall raised £3-18-0.
