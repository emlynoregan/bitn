Burra Town Council 21 Jan.

The bridge in Young St had cost Â£97-15-5.  [i.e. the swing bridge at the White Hart Ford.]  Cr Hammond was concerned that on Show Day it might be subjected to 30 or 40 people at once and some of the strands of the wire rope were broken.  Cr Woollacott said the rope was better than that in the Kooringa bridge and would likely support 10 tons.  Cr Riggs and the overseer agreed all was well.  Cr Kellaway said it was adequate, though it had been lying about the mine for 40 years and must have deteriorated.

There was a discussion on the cost of tar dressing roads v. metalled roads.  The cost of tar dressing being now far cheaper than it had been even 4 years before.
