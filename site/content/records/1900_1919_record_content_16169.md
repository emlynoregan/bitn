Burra High School [Bleak House] held an ‘At Home’ for prize distribution.  Rev. Wightwick presided and Mrs John Drew gave out the prizes.  The entertainment program is printed as is the list of prize winners.  Among the latter Hazel Bartholomaeus was Senior Division Dux and Vera Fuss won a prize for 2-years Full Attendance, Mrs Roach’s Arithmetic Prize, the Rector’s Scripture Prize and was second in Senior Division.  In the Intermediate Division Flossie Richards was top and in the Junior Division Jack Richards had highest marks.  Attendance in 1905 was remarkably broken.  Of the staff, Miss Sangster is leaving after 4½ years and Miss Vera Wilkinson intends to pursue her interests in science and will probably take her University Science course in 1906.  This means a substantially new staff in 1906.

Annie B. Millar, Principal.
