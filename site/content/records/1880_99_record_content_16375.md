Letter.  ‘Doubtful’ writes hoping to be assured that the following rumours are wrong.

That the man appointed to attend to the Waterworks is to be replaced despite the fact that ‘those who had previously employed him, say that he was just the man for the place and work'.

A member of the council ‘has a friend, perhaps a kinsman, whom he would like to have appointed'.
