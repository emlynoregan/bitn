Tothill’s Creek News, 21 October

On Tuesday morning at about 3 a.m. fire broke out in the Royal Oak Hotel, which being of highly combustible materials was in danger of being quickly totally consumed.  Fortunately a number of men employed in repairing the road were lodged in a neighbouring building and after an hour’s hard work the hotel was saved.  The fire was first seen by a daughter of the landlord Mr Hodges in the roof of a room adjoining her bedroom.

After the re-opening of the general store last week, we now have news that the butcher shop will be re-opened next week.
