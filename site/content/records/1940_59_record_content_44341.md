Burra Town Council is indignant at the Education Department’s response to the contractor’s decision that he could not operate the Booborowie School bus.  He advised them on 30 January.  The department will not pay more than 1/4 a mile while in Adelaide taxis on bitumen roads cost 1/- a mile.  Two offers to the Department were made: one at the old price for Booborowie to Burra and one at 1/9 a mile.  The former driver lives at Booborowie North and would require to be paid for 10 miles per day beyond Booborowie.  The department has refused to consider this cost of 13/4 a day.  This leaves children from Booborowie who have arranged to come to Burra High School stranded without a school and primary students from Copperhouse also stranded, as the school there has been closed.  To re-open this would cost up to £10 a week to save £3-6-8 on transport costs.
