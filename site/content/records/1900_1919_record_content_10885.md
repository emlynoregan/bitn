Sport in Burra

Last year the cricket fell nearly flat with only a few games played.

Coursing has met with only partial success despite having a number of interested dog owners in the town.

Rifle-shooting has many excellent shots in Burra, but the club has just been wound up after a lingering death.

Quoits and skittles were popular in the mining days.

Lacrosse had a short life and did not take on.

Golf lingers, but is not generally played, though the links await players.

Polo always attracts a crowd, but although it was played a few years ago on the Aberdeen ground there is now a lack of players and games are very occasional.

Tennis was inaugurated in Kooringa by Rev. W.G. Clarke.  One court has been asphalted and others fenced and improved.
