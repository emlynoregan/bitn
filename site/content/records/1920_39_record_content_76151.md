Des Pexton & Ron Kellock did well at the no. 4 District Union Prize Meeting at Gawler last Friday & Saturday.  On Saturday wind and rain flattened four targets and smashed the frames and the team shoot and ‘The Bell’ were shot in conjunction due to the delay.  Burra came second in the team match by 3 points.  Mansfield from Angaston won the aggregate.
