Solomon Williams.  Reminiscences of Burra in the 1850s & Early 1860s.

The mine was worked on the tribute system.  Miners were paid a percentage of the value of the ore they produced.  I think I am correct in saying the mine found power and appliances for raising the ore to the surface and timber for underground work, water and appliances for dressing and the miners found the labour.  The ground was surveyed into blocks at various levels.  These blocks were called ‘pitches’.  The tribute was controlled by the richness of the ore contained therein.  If it were rich 4/- or 5/- tribute would pay fair wages, but if it were poor 10/- or more would be required.  As it was a piece-work system the harder the men worked the more they got paid.

Evert ‘pitch’ was numbered and contracts called ‘takes’ ran for two months when another ‘take’ was entered into.  These short term contracts enabled the mine authorities to alter the tribute should developments warrant it.  If rich ore was discovered then down would go the tribute.  The day for new contracts was called servaday.  The pitches were worked in companies of 2, 3 or more, one of whom attended on servaday to accept a new ‘take’.  Pitches were numbered and called ‘No. 50, 7/6’ and a pebble was picked from a dish and thrown and if no objection came before it landed the pitch was let at that price.  Enquiries the day before could discover if the tribute was to be reduced.  If the tribute was reduced too far the men could refuse the take.

Ore was taken from the lode and wheeled to the ‘plat’, which was a timbered room opening into a shaft.  When there was enough stuff deposited at the plat for a day’s hauling the whim was used to raise it to the surface.  There it was carted to the ‘strakes’ and jigs where it was dressed or concentrated and then moved to a pile.  Piles were 30ft or 40ft square and about 2½ft high with a flat top.  Two samples were taken for assay – careful procedures ensured fair samples from the inside of the heap were obtained.  The sample was weighed and then dried in a frying pan and then weighed again.  The ore was then weighed a hundredweight at a time in a barrow.

The most important machine on the mine was the pumping engine.  When only a small boy I was taken to the boiler house of Schneider’s Engine with its three great boilers.  Later I saw Morphett’s Engine House which seemed a marvel of ingenuity and force.  The water it raised ran through wooden flumes or launders as they were called into the engine pool, filling it up during the night and by sluice-gate it was run out in the day to be used for dressing purposes.  In summer this pool was used for swimming, although the water was very cold.  There was a smaller pool near the engineer’s shop with warm water from the engine condensing water.  This was shallower and swarmed with boys who played for hours with planks and rafts therein.

A waterwheel operated the giant lathe and drilling machinery of the engineer’s shop, while the largest waterwheel on the mine powered the rock crusher and sawmill.  I estimate from memory its diameter must have been 50ft.  This water came from the engine pool on its way to the dressers.  There was a tram line and a truck which carried the rocks of ore to the crusher.  From the crusher they dropped into a revolving screen and from there into a dray which carried them to the dressers.  The saw-mill and carpenter’s shop had a large machine to hold a number of upright saws.  I have seen the trunk of a gum tree four feet in diameter and some 30ft long with six vertical saws ready to start cutting.

Another spectacular machine was the steam-powered hauling engine or as miners called it the ‘firewhim’.  A large iron wheel outside on which was wound a great length of thick flat rope.  The kibbles used for hauling here were much larger than on the horse-powered whims.

[Williams then describes in some detail how kibbles were handles and unloaded.]

Kibbles or buckets used to carry the ore were of strong iron sheets riveted together.  They were egg-shaped so the bulging sides would prevent the top rim from catching on the timbering of the shaft or from fouling each other as they passed in the shaft.
