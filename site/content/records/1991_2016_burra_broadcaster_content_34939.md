Letter.  Mary Woollacott writes a longer letter in response to Leo Sturman on behalf of the wardens and congregation of St Mary’s Church.  She echoed much of what has already been noted, but also pointed out that St Joseph’s Catholic Church and St Mary’s Anglican Church were both open every day to locals and tourists alike.  The Uniting Church would be open on Saturday 13 November.

‘But such places do not necessarily have to be turned into a formal part of the festival as they exist for a totally different purpose than the “bread and circuses” that go with even the most admirable of festivals and local celebrations.’

Like other letters on this subject the writer then drew attention to the ways members of all church congregations support local community organisations.
