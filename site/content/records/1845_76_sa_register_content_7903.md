W.H. writes from Forest Creek, 25 January 1852.

[He reports having been there for 10 days without any success yet.  The party had sunk five holes varying from 8 to 20 ft deep, but found nothing.  It was very hard work.  He says of those around that some have made fortunes, but the majority have barely made decent wages.  The area is honeycombed with holes, making walking at night very dangerous.  Scores of men, he says, are leaving in disgust at the way they have to live.  The costs are excessive.  He does not advise coming at present with water so scarce.]
