The Capital Debt on 1 October 1944 would be £3,160.

The interest would be 4%.

The debt would be repaid over 20 years at the rate of £112-14-2 every six months.

If payment were not made by the 8th of the month when due the interest would rise to 4½%.

Already the Institute was paying £160 p.a. in interest so the Council would have to find £65 p.a. for 20 years to pay off the debt.  This was a saving of £1,700 on the previous proposal.

It was decided to have a special meeting of Council on 10 July to decide the matter.
