Court.

Lucy Gully (11), Benjamin Gully (10), Ethel Gull (7) & Martha Gully (6) were charged with being neglected children.

The case is somewhat odd in that Corporal Richard Noble laid the complaint because ‘I had orders to do so.’  But his evidence is not very damning and included the statement ‘Apparently Mr & Mrs Gully are fond of their children, and I have been told they are.’

‘Have you any police records against the Gullys?

Witness: only the educational ones’  [i.e. for non-attendance the required number of days.]

We learn from T.H. Woollacott that Mr Gully has worked for the railways and has been there for about 21 years.  ‘He bears a good character.’

Though perhaps not relevant to this case Mounted Constable Richard Joseph Jemison revealed that when the summons was served Mrs Gully ordered Jemison and Noble off her property and rushed at Jemison with a knife ‘And said she’d be strung for both of us.’

[Reading between the lines there is a suspicion that the bench was somewhat amused at this and dryly commented ‘Well there might be truth in what the witness is saying, and if so there is grounds for another information; we will leave it at that.’

One might also suspect that this whole thing is a reaction of Jemison to the results of the Agnes Gully case.]
