On 29 August students and teachers went on an educational tour to Adelaide.  They caught the 6.55 a.m. train and arrived in Adelaide at 10.30 a.m.  On arrival buses took the girls to Motteram’s Biscuit Factory and the boys to British Tube Mills.  The parties met for lunch at Pt Adelaide, after which they went to Outer Harbour and had ‘free run’ of the liner Stratheden for half an hour.  In the afternoon a visit was made to the GMH works and an hour was allowed for shopping in the city from 4.30 p.m. before they joined the Broken Hill express, where the cafeteria car was the main interest for some time.
