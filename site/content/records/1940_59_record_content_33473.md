Burra & District War Memorial Committee has received news that Mrssrs Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. has decided to accede to the committeeâ€™s request and make a gift to the committee of a portion of Block 13, adjacent to the Drill Hall.  It is large enough to contain at least six tennis courts.  The gift is much appreciated and we understand the material for enclosing the courts has already been made available.
