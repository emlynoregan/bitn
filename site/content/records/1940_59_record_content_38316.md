Notice.  Burra Lawn Tennis Club advises that preparations are under way to make the courts playable by the start of December this year.  We have a large number of intending players.  Membership fee is three guineas per head.  We ask for early payment to meet the cost of putting the courts in order and for the cost of mower and maintenance.  President, J.N. McBride; Vice-President, M.G. Dobson; Treasurer, A. Stewart and Secretary, L.P. Bence.
