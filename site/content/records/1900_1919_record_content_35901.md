Editorial.  The Broken Hill Express.

Burra is the largest town north of Gawler and it is hard to credit ceasing to stop here for a saving of a paltry 5 minutes in a journey of 14 hours.

Many passengers for Broken Hill join in Burra.

Large interests beyond Petersburg are held by Burra residents who therefore often use the express â€“ e.g. Messrs William, Robert, A.J. & Norman McBride, C. Bartholomaeus, L. & A. Gebhardt and the proprietors of Gum Creek, Koonoona and Manunda properties.  All these own properties on the line.

Each of the stock salesmen has offices at Petersburg, Jamestown and Broken Hill and use the express frequently.  All these will be greatly inconvenienced.

The mail we get by the express will of course be stopped.
