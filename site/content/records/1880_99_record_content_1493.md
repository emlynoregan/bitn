Obituary & Inquest at Hanson [i.e. Farrell’s Flat] on Tuesday 3 August.  J.D. Cave JP, coroner, on the body of Thomas Horrigan. [Also said his name was Thomas Horrigan Mulcahy, but the death is registered under Horrigan, aged 50.] James V. O’Loghlin, foreman of the jury.  The deceased was found in a paddock and died in a dray on the way into the Hanson Hotel.

Deceased had been working for William Mackay of Hanson, road contractor, who last saw him at the bar of the Hanson Hotel on 31 July.  He had left the camp earlier that day in the company of John Lawler.  He knew of no ill feeling between the men.

John Mackay, son of William, confirmed the above.  He saw deceased on 2 September in a Gum Creek paddock 1½ miles from Hanson, lying on his back and still alive.  Brought him in a dray to Hanson, but he died on the way.

[Various others gave evidence some of which seems to be designed to minimise the amount of alcohol the deceased was known to have consumed, they included: John Lawler, labourer; Patrick O’Reilly, farmer; Thomas James Barrett, landlord of the Hanson Hotel; and Richard Phelan, policeman of Redruth.]

The verdict was that he died from exposure probably after becoming drowsy from the effects of alcohol.
