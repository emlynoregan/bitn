Burra Progress Association was formed on 1 August 1939.  The late F.T. Sara was Chairman and Mr John Bowles was Secretary.  Its last meeting was on 1 December 1955 when it had a credit balance of Â£75-4-7.  This has grown with interest to be now $232.60.  In March 1956, when the building of the swimming pool was under discussion, the Progress Association went into recess because it was the same few people who would be involved with the new project.  Now only two local signatories remain in C.H. Cummins and H.J. Topsfield and it has been decided to wind up its financial concerns.  Yesterday it was decided to hand the balance to the Tourist Promotion Committee President, Mr W. Scott.
