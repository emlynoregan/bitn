Scouts.  On 20 April a meeting was held in the Scout Hall and General Secretary C.W. Potter & Country Commissioner Mr Kemp visited.  24 Scouts & Cubs attended.  It is hoped the troop will soon be up to strength and Mr M. Morton Sen. decided to carry on in the hope that a younger man will soon be found to relieve him.
