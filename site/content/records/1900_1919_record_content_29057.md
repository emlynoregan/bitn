Burra Town Council

The Council decided it could not refund rates paid on McBride Cottage Homes.

Bagot, Shakes & Lewis as agents for Mrs Moody wrote saying alterations to the shop in Commercial St were contemplated, but they could not make any promise to remove verandah posts.

Messrs Tennant & Finch of East Ward asked for a crossing of Burra Creek to be made near the slaughterhouse.  The matter was left with the Ward Councillors.

Leighton & Ironmine Sports were held last Wednesday and are reported with the results.  Apart from the usual races and jumping events others held included: cotton-winding for ladies, tossing the caber, tilting, nail-driving for ladies, sheaf-tossing and a threading-the-needle race.

Burra Rifle Club.  10th match for Urwinâ€™s Medal.  Best scores came from C. Muller, G. Herbert & M. Radford.

Mt Bryan Methodist Church held its Harvest Thanksgiving last Sunday with two sermons from Rev. H.J. Parkinson.

Kooringa Methodist Tennis Club held a concert last Monday to liquidate debt caused by the erection of a shelter-shed at the court.
