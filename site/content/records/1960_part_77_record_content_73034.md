The Burra to Adelaide Cycling Classic was held on 28 September.  Kevin Phillips of Rostrevor was the winner of the event, which was first run in 1907.  Conditions for the race were bitterly cold and wet, but with a strong tail wind for the whole 162 km.  [This canâ€™t be literally true, since the race went north to Mt Bryan and then returned to Burra.]  Fastest was Victorian scratch man Hilton Clark, in a record 3 hours 29 minutes 15 seconds.
