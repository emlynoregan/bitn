Soldiers’ Aid Society 13th Annual Meeting was held in Redruth Memorial Hall.  President Miss Bubb reported four new members to boost the falling numbers.  Average attendance this year was 13 as against 12 the previous year and 13 the year before that.  They handed £15-17-0 to the Angorichina Car Fund, £10 having come to them from The Home League Society in Adelaide.  The annual strawberry fete brought in £71 last November.  Half they kept for their own needs and half went to the Royal Institution for the Blind.  This enabled £20 to be sent to Red Cross for Christmas Cheer.

The State War Council has written saying we cannot donate to the Royal Institution for the Blind unless it can be shown that returned soldiers received the benefit.  The manager of the Institution has written confirming the same.

Election: President, Miss Bubb; Vice-Presidents, Mesdames M.A. Radford, F. Pearce Sen. & T. Turner; Treasurer, Mrs M.A. Radford; Secretary, Miss Bubb.
