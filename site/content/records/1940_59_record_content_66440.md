Booborowie School held its Christmas Party with a huge tree as the centre piece.  The school was much improved in 1954 with new paint and flywire doors and window screens and a new mill-head to supply water for a septic system, which is being installed over the holidays.  Fifty-two children are on the roll.  Electric light has been installed.
