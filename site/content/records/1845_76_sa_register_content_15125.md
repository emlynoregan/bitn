During the week Mr G.E. Hamilton, Government Surveyor, with some assistants, has been surveying the line of main road through this township and Redruth.  I hope something will be done in the way of making as well as marking the road, lest our principal thoroughfare again present the same dismal spectacle next year as it hitherto has done as soon as the rains set in.

[Note that this survey resulted in the creation of the modern line of the main road to the northwest of Young Street; the road known as Watt Road.  The map below shows the original town survey and the new line of road shaded in.  It bears the note: ‘Portions of the within Lots 36, 37, 59, 60, 61, 74, 75, 76, 90, 91, 116 & 117 have been taken for New Roads Vide confirmation of Road Order in Gazette of 28 August 1862.’

Parts of lots 38, 39 & 40 were taken for road purposes later.]
