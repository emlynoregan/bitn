Kooringa News, 19 January

There is something of a mining mania here at present, with any new discovery attracting great interest.  A meeting was held at the Court House Hotel last week, to form a company to work a section taken out on a mineral lease by Messrs Fry & Smith, not far from Bundaleer.  300 shares were reserved for the discoverers and 1,000 offered for sale at £2 each.  All were immediately sold.  A call of 5/- per share was made on Monday night and all but 130 were paid up.  It is situated about three miles from the Wheal Sarah of Messrs Bath & Bosance.  [The correspondent thought that from personal observation it had few prospects.]  Wheal Sarah had 30 tons of good ore at grass and three dray loads had been brought in to the Smelting Works.  Presently it employs about 12 men.  The land near the Wheal Sarah and the River Broughton Mining Company’s section is well worth exploring and if not successful for mining a large area will be opened up for agriculture.

A meeting of the shareholders of the Sod Hut Mine was held at the Burra Hotel on Wednesday evening.

There is also the Glen Terry Mine, situated southwest of the Burra Mine.

The musical celebrity Miska Hauser has visited here, but Signor Cutolo did not, although he came as far as Kapunda.
