Mt Bryan East.  The winter brought snow and frosts a-plenty along with much wind and sufficient rain to produce promising crops, especially on the new lands.  The cold had delayed growth.  The roads towards Burra are in a wretched state, ‘but apparently when someone is killed the authorities will send labourers to fill the holes’.
