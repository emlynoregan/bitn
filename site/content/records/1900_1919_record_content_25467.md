Burra Town Council.

The Town Clerk of Kapunda replied to a query re extinguishing fires, that they had a fire brigade, which cost Â£107-16-11 p.a. paid for by a 2d rate.

Council declines to lease the Market Square standpipe.

Pipe to be attached in Market Square for convenience of the public to fill tanks.

[This is unclear: does it mean attached to the pump and so avoiding payment to the Waterworks?]
