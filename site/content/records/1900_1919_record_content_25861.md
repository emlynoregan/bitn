World’s End Races were well attended and in every way successful, except they got behind time and some events had to be cancelled.  As well as six horse races there was a Sheffield Handicap, a cotton-winding contest, a boys’ race, wood chopping and a couple of other foot races.  Results in 1¼ columns.

There is also a humorous article of a bit over ½ column describing a day at the World’s End Races.  Among the description of the group’s troubles they took the wrong road and ended at ‘Midwinter’s old hotel, which has long since been demolished.’
