Burra Hospital

The paddock opposite the main building has been ploughed ready to plant lucerne.  Super and lucerne seed have been donated along with posts and strainers.

The new garden design plans are on display in Mr Baulderstone’s window.

Lady George will be the guest of Mr & Mrs Andrew Tennant at Princess Royal on the 3 & 4 December and has agreed to open the fete organised by Women’s Organisations of the District to aid the Burra Hospital.
