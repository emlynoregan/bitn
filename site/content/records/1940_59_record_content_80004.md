The numbering of issues in 1957.

This year was quite bizarre in both its sequence of volume numbers and of issue numbers.

The year began with:

Volume 88, Issue No. 1 on 8 January 1957

And continued to

Volume 88, Issue No. 15 on 16 April 1957 (Numbers 1-8 having been used in 1954) when it changed volume number to

Volume 86, Issue No. 16 on 23 April 1957

And continued to

Volume 86, Issue No. 19 on 14 May 1957 after which the next issue was

Volume 86, Issue No. 14 on 21 May 1957.  Oddly enough earlier irregularities in Volume 86 meant that the Numbers 14 & 15 had not previously been used with Volume 86.

With Volume 86, No. 16 on 4 June 1957 to

Volume 86, No. 21 on 9 July 1957 the issue numbers had previously been used: 16 to 19 in April and May 1957 and 20 to 21 in May & June 1954.

The issue number then jumped to

Volume 86, No. 29, 17 July 1957, after which it proceeded regularly to

Volume 86, No. 42, 15 October 1957; with all issue numbers having previously been used in 1954.

The volume number then changes again:

Volume 87, No. 43, 22 October 1957 and then runs fairly regularly through to

Volume 87, No. 51 on 23 December 1957 with just two irregularities:

No. 49 is used twice, for 3 December and 10 December and No 51 is the only number in this run of Volume 87 numbers that is not a repeated number.  [Volume 87 having previously been used for the 1956 papers.]
