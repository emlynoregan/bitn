Burra Picnic Race Club has had a very good year.  President John Oates said in his annual report that improvements this year were sheds and buildings painted, showers and hot water installed, tank stand erected, horse stalls and yard repaired.  A ‘Members Only’ bar was also erected.  The meeting on Saturday was followed by a dance extending into the small hours of Sunday.  This year the groups to benefit were each given $200.  They were: Burra Ambulance Service, Burra CFS, Burra SES and Burra Pony Club.
