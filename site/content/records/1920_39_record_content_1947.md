RSL 2nd AGM with President Dr Steele in the chair.  The general sense of the report was that members were taking benefits, but not giving much in return by attending meetings.  The club was nicely in credit.  Elected:	President	Dr Steele

Vice-Presidents	S.M. Lane, V.B. Wheare & D.L. Van Senden

The dinner in the Cheer-up Hall is reported at length in 1Â¾ columns.
