Ian Auhl writes a letter to the editor commenting on the Copper Interpretation Centre Crisis.

If Burra loses the Jubilee 150 grant it threatens the viability of the town itself as a tourist town.  The Copper Interpretation Centre was intended to interpret SA’s copper mining and place SA’s copper mining towns in a world perspective.  Burra was recognised as the appropriate place for this by the Board of Jubilee 150 and as a result of a concept by R.J. Noye of Clare and lobbying by myself and the Burra Burra DC a grant of $270,000 was made to establish the Copper Interpretation Centre.  The Centre would give SA a genuine historic town to show visitors - SA’s counterpart at Maldon in Victoria – and not to Swan Hill or Sovereign Hill.  Burra is the genuine article.  ‘Surely Burra will protest en masse to having its money, honestly obtained, dishonestly sidetracked to some other project.’

Perhaps the time has come got the town to strike against the delaying tactics of a government department ‘which seems to have decided from the very beginning of negotiations that it knows what it best for Burra’. 

I have protested personally to the Premier and to the State Ombudsman with no tangible results.  Other concerned people in Clare, Burra and Adelaide have also protested.

‘The net result of such protests is not a genuine attempt to find a satisfactory home for the Copper Centre, but to cease negotiations with Burra Council and to re-allocate the grant altogether.’
