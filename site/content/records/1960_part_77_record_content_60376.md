Burra Copper Festival

The Governor Sir Mark Oliphant will visit Burra during the Copper Festival 7-9 October.   He will unveil a plaque on the resited Peacock’s Chimney Stack on Sunday 8 October.  The Committee is considering many suggestions put forward for the festival.  Mr Michael Trinnick of the [British] National Trust’s Committee for Devon and Cornwall has sent £10 sterling for the building fund appeal and says that in Cornwall they have preserved four Cornish engines in their original houses and hope to get one moving by steam.  There is a fifth one in Holman’s Museum in Cambourne.  The National Trust owns several ruined engine houses as well.  These have been repaired and made safe for the foreseeable future and work on another will begin soon at Wheal Coates in the Parish of St Agnes, north of Truro in Cornwall.
