D. McDonald Steele writes re the Isolation Ward at the Hospital.  He criticises Mr E.J. Davey, Inspector, for failing to mention that the state of the ward was the result of an accident.  The ward is rarely used, but is scrubbed and cleaned every fortnight and then left open to air, but on this occasion it was forgotten to close the doors and during a storm turkeys took refuge in ti with the consequences reported.  Since Mr Davey is also a member of the Board it might have been expected he would be more understanding, or at least have mentioned the true cause.
