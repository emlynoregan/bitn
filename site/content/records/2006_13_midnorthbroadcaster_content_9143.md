Tony Thorogood of Burra was in North Adelaide at the Melbourne St Cellars last Thursday for the launch of his book Cider, Drink It, Make It, Cook with It.  Tony and Susan Thorogood have had great success with their popular cider and apple wines, which have won many awards and gold medals over the past decade.  The book brings together a great deal of information about the making and history of cider and its relationship with food and health.  The book was launched by Advertiser food and wine writer, Tony Love.  [Photo of Tony love and the author.]
