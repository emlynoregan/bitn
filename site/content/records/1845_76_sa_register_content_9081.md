The Burra Burra Mines and Smelting Works

The great Burra Burra Mines, which long ago proved the salvation of the colony, were deserted by the miners for the more glittering prospects of goldfields and it was not thought worthwhile even to keep the engine at work.   The water was consequently allowed to rise and the 85 horse-power Roach’s engine, named for the captain of the Mine was taken down.  Its size had been found insufficient, the country around not being drained, as in Cornwall, by numerous other engines.  It was packed away; a new one of 250 horse-power, named after Mr Schneider of the Smelting Company, having previously been erected upon a new shaft named after him.  Lately as the attraction of the goldfields diminished, it was decided to recommence working the Mine as labour returned.  In a short time Schneider’s engine had the water in fork to the 40 fathom level.

In Kooringa the deserted houses, or at least as many of them as destructive hands have left inhabitable, are now re-occupied.  It is now hard foe returning or new miners to find accommodation.  The appearance of the town is cheerful and businesslike.  Trade is flourishing.

On approaching the Mine, Schneider’s Engine-House dominates, with its giant beam appearing at the top of the building.  It works at seven strokes per minute, with each stroke lifting 136 gallons of water.  Before the water was in fork it was working at almost twice that speed.  The shears above Roach’s Shaft remain, though the engine has been removed.  The figure of the miner with his pick and dag still occupies his old place.  The shaft has been repaired and is used for raising ore.

Another engine, known as No. 2 and of 40 horse-power is employed in crushing ore, with two rollers half an inch apart, capable of turning out 50 tons a day.  At present it is producing 35-40 tons per day.  It is also raising water from the deep levels of Ayer’s No. 2 shaft.

Near the engine houses are the Mine Offices and residences of the principal officers.  Captain Roach, who is the head of the entire establishment, has a substantial stone house, containing four rooms, adjoining which are the offices.  These comprise the Boardroom, captain’s consulting and changing rooms, pay office, accountant’s office, assay office and draughtsman’s room.  Next to them is the house of Mr Elphick the Assay-Master, in front of which and of Captain Roach’s are carefully tended gardens.  There are also residences for Dr Mayne, the Mine Surgeon, the second, third and fourth captains (Messrs Bryant, Goldsworthy & Mitchell), for Mr Congdon, the Chief Engineer and for some other officers.

Near this little village is a pool of about an acre in extent, in course of excavation, which will form a reservoir for the water thrown up by the engines.  It is probable that this will be beautified by planting trees around it and there are rumours of stocking it with fish and setting a pleasure craft on its surface.

The smiths’ shop, miners’ tool shed and shoeing shed should be noted.  There are six forges, five of which are now at work employing five men and four lads.  The material house or general shop is where all articles are kept that are likely to be needed at the Mine.  Not far away are the offices of the Night Captain.

The numerous jigging machines and other contrivances for ore washing are kept under secure sheds.

The stables are substantial buildings with stalls for about 50 horses and the sheds about the yards will accommodate 200 more.  At present 85 horses are working in the Mine.

Another yard some 203 acres in size is walled in stone and contains the timber used in the Mine and copper received from the Smelting Works.

On top of the surrounding hills may be seen the flues of the different engines and also the magazine, containing usually five or six tons of powder.

Schneider’s Engine is a beautiful piece of workmanship, made by the Perran Co., large Cornish manufacturers.  It has an 80 inch cylinder with a 12 foot stroke.  The steam is supplied by three boilers.  The fuel used is wood and coal together.  The engineer, Mr Congdon, was formerly engaged in the South Carron Mine near Liskeard and came to Australia as the Chief Engineer of the steamer Omega. In the week ending 10 March the engine performed 71,196 strokes and raised 9,682,656 gallons.  The water is conveyed by troughs and cuttings for the convenient washing of the ore and eventually finds its way into the Burra creek, of which it makes a complete rivulet.  The water, as it comes from the Mine is perfectly clear and wholesome, but that usually used for drinking is generally drawn from wells about 60 ft deep.

Our correspondent was arrayed in proper dress and accompanied by Captains Henry Roach and Richard Goldsworthy, ventured underground.  Both Captains are Cornishmen, the former from Redruth and the latter from Bodmin.  They have been at the Mine for 9 and 8 years respectively.  Captain Roach went from England to Columbia in 1832 as a miner for the Bolivar Co.  He became Captain in 1834 and continued in that position till 1842, when he returned to England.  He came to Sain 1846 in the Hooghly and was almost immediately engaged at the Burra Mine.

The party descended by ladder in Waterhouse’s footway for four fathoms and then through various galleries, passing Peacock’s No. 1 & No. 2 shafts and reaching Schneider’s engine shaft at the 20 fathom.  There the 20 inch plunger makes the second lift, the lower plunger having raised the water from the 40 fathom.  They then descended to the 30 and 40 fathom levels by Peacock’s ladder winzes.  In the latter the deeper plunger works.

They then visited the various galleries and shafts on the 40 fathom level, which is kept dry by another level running from Schneider’s to Roach’s and called the deep 40, two fathoms lower.

Ayer’s No. 2 shaft has a level at 50 fathoms containing malachite, but nothing is doing in it at present below the 40 fathom level.  The shaft itself is sunk 5 fathoms deeper (the deepest miners have so far gone) and there are now 10 fathoms of water in it, which will be pumped out by the No. 2 engine.

Then they returned to the 30 fathom level by Ayer’s ladder winze.  It is at that level and the 40 that the principal work is going on at present.  At the 30 there are many galleries as well as Kingston’s, Graham’s and several other shafts.  The tributers here seem to be doing well.  The 20 fathom may be reached by Graham’s ladder winze, which also conducts to the 12, the 6 and the surface.

[The article them reports on current operations in each shaft.]

The number of hands currently engaged on underground and surface work is about 450.

The effects of allowing the water to rise were greater than many may have imagined.

Most of the 30 and 40 fathom levels were blocked up with soft slush at least breast high.  All that had to be removed.  The wooden slabs were generally forced inwards, so that the greater part of the mine has had to be fresh timbered.  About 20 or 30 men are still engaged in preparing slabs for this purpose.

The average of the ores now being raised does not exceed 20%, though some in the 40 fathom level is far richer.

The company’s property around the Mine has a very desolate and barren appearance.  It has lately been entirely denuded of trees by order of the Directors, who finding they could not preserve them from depredation, determined on using them at once.

The present high prices of provisions militate against the successful working of the Mine.  The lowest wages upon which the men can live and the high transport costs mean that profits are less than in former times.  There are no sulphurets in the Burra Mine, or the ore might be reduced to regulus.  The only course that can be pursued with the lower grade ores is to smelt them in the colony.  This has been done for some years at the neighbouring smelting works, but the high cost of fuel is a great discouragement.
