Public Meeting re Burra Mine, at the Institute last Friday.

The report on the move to approach the Government to lend a pumping plant to unwater the mine fills most of the page, but ends abruptly in mid sentence.

A large and representative body of residents met to consider approaching the Government with the view of asking them to lend a pumping plant to the Burra Burra Copper Co. to unwater the open cut.  The Mayor, Mr J. Winnall, said it was a question that would affect all SA, not just Burra.  He hoped the result of the meeting would be a step towards the resumption of active operations at the mine.

Mr E.W. Crewes said he hoped the steps to be taken would result in thousands being employed.  They had not met to tear the directors to pieces.  He believed they had done everything possible under the circumstances.  In three years four months since the mine was refloated as a company he had expected great things.  In his imagination he saw thousands of miners wending their way home and old buildings in the town torn down to be replaced by new and the old houses in the square give way to new shops.  But none of this had happened.  The results from the 100 tons sent to Wallaroo were satisfactory, but the directors now said that the expense of a pumping plant and new machinery was beyond them.  All they can do is to go on prospecting in the hope of finding a rich lode that would assist them financially.

One day he and Dr Sangster were talking and they decided they had to get to the bottom of it all.  [That is the apparent inaction by the directors.]  They decided to go to Adelaide and see the directors.  The directors said the enormous expense of raising the ore prevented them from proceeding as they would like.  They did not want merely to raise ore, but to treat it before sending it away so that the town would get as much benefit as possible.  They explained that the erection of machinery was stalled for lack of capital.  If a sufficient new ore body could be exposed to view they were sure that Adelaide investors would come forward.

Crewes said the company had £3,000 at present and they could not let it just dribble away.  He thought the only way forward was to ask the Government to assist by lending a plant to unwater the mine.  The mine had saved SA in the past and had never received any subsidy and was entitled to some consideration now.  The whole of the state would benefit from the restarting of the mine.  Some of our best families are leaving us on account of the scarcity of work and others will go if something does not turn up directly.  The Government has assisted other mining companies and they should therefore help Burra.  He moved a motion that it was desirable the Government be asked to assist by supplying a pumping plant and unwatering the mine, thus opening up a large field for the employment of labour and advancing the prosperity of the district and the state.  Dr Sangster seconded the motion which was carried.

Dr Sangster said he considered the meeting the most important in the town for many years, as it could waft back prosperity or leave the town as it was then.  He was anxious for a policy of progress.  He said he had lived in Burra for a quarter of a century, reared a family there and hoped to see out his working life there.  Everyone should take an active interest in the progress of the town.  He endorsed Mr Crewes’ remarks and said that after they had heard the directors’ remarks they had decided to return to the town and report to the people.  If something was not done soon all the capital would be gone and they would be worse off than they were at the present time.  If the Government came to the party with a pump the directors had £3,000 to spend on erecting machinery.  The shareholders would not respond to a call until something more was being done than at present.  Those who have known Burra for 25 years know what it has been and a reflection on the last ten years shows them to have been a series of failures in many ways.  Families have moved away.  Young men are leaving: since Christmas over 30 have gone either to Broken Hill or WA.  Business has been hampered: it has had to extend credit, some of it for all time.  If we do not shake ourselves further decline will follow.  Other places have received assistance.  Why not Burra?

He said he hoped a strong deputation would be appointed to influence the Government at lend the plant asked for.

Mr Winnall said before the mine was refloated the Government had lent a drilling plant to the company and at that time the Government Geologist, Mr Brown, said as a result he recommended opening up Morphett’s Shaft and going on with work.  This made it likely the Government would come to the rescue.

Mr J. Drew said he had taken great interest in the Burra Mine.  He said most of the profit for the old mine had come from above the water level.  The sulphide lodes can be traced in several shafts for some 400yds.  They had, he believed, a good claim on Government aid, not having previously asked for a penny.  They would not be risking much - £1,000 to £1,200 would cover all they were asking for.  All they wanted was to lower the water to the 300ft level.  There was enough ore to employ 1,000 men and Burra would regain its prosperity.

Captain Pryor said he had faith in the mine and thought it well worth testing and he believed it would reveal a greater body of ore than hitherto unearthed.  The old mine had not been developed systematically.  We must go down he said.  There was 9,000 to 10,000 tons of ore in sight and he believed much more would be exposed below water level.  He believed approaching the Government was a reasonable proposition.  The district was fast becoming depopulated.

[The report breaks off, but a deputation was evidently appointed to give effect to the motion that was passed.]
