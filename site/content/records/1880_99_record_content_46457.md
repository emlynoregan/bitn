The Redruth Correspondent:

Calls for the Aberdeen light to be lit!

Work at the Bon Accord Bridge is at a standstill as it waits for the ironwork from England.

This is now believed to be in SA and last week a lot of timber and planking was delivered.

The new boiler at the Waterworks has been finished and is in use.

C.A. Uhrlaub writes to respond to allegations that Aberdeen did not engage to play a Mt Bryan and Burra combined team.  True, he says, but Mt Bryan is a new club and could muster only 14.  In order to not disappoint the visitors some Hallett men and three Burraites were added.
