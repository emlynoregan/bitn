Heaviest Load on SA Roads

Last week the heaviest load to be transported on SA roads passed Burra on the Barrier Highway.  The load was a 188-tonne electricity transformer en route from Brisbane to Adelaide.  It was hauled by three prime movers and pushed by two more.  The whole consist stretched 130 m.  Two of the transformers are being installed by ElectraNet as part of the Adelaide central Reinforcement project, which will increase power supply capability to the Adelaide Central Business District.
