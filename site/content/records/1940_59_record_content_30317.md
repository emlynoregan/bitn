‘The Man Who Sees’ writes in response to the article last week: ‘Should Paxton Square be condemned?’  He says that this case seems to be the first of its kind actually named, though it was stated that the area in question had been in existence for about 85 years.  How many of the same sub-standard areas could be named?  If these are sub-standard dwellings have they in the last 85 years been inspected or condemned and if so what steps have been taken to remedy or remove the cause?  Who is responsible for altering these conditions that are impairing human lives? Three matters need to be addressed that affect low wage earners:

The legitimate rent that can be enforced from tenants of these low grade dwellings.

The economic rent that can be charged when rent is based on the value of the dwelling.

The proper assessment of all property based on the value of the building or the annual rental value.

V. Chapman writes saying that residents of Paxton’s Square much resent the letter of the so-called informant condemning the Square.  Plenty of people in the town live in glass houses.  What should also be stopped is leasing the creek as a sheep run.  The Town Council should know that poison baits have been laid in the town.

The Police say it is untrue that they will not assist owners of sheep who suffer losses through killer dogs.  In the matter raised in last week’s paper they cannot take action because the court proceedings which might take place between the stockowner and the owner of the killer dog come under the jurisdiction of the civil court.

The Housing Trust of SA proposes to build homes in Angaston, Nuriootpa, Eudunda, Pt Pirie, Pt Augusta and Mt Gambier, but has no plans as yet for Burra.  In the war the Mayor Mr T.H. Woollacott inaugurated a scheme in which city people not engaged in war efforts came to live in Burra housing and the plan filled Burra’s accommodation to overflowing.  One repercussion has been that these people are still here and likely to remain and as a result young men returning from the war and seeking to start families cannot find accommodation.  The Housing Trust should lend a sympathetic ear under these circumstances.  The Trust went so far as to take an option over one possible building site, but nothing more has been heard.
