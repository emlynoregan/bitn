The archaeological survey records many finds from the hotel site and among the other fragments there was a piece of china bearing the word ‘Viceroy’.  One cannot but wonder whether in fact this came from a later era that the hotel and instead dates from a time when tea leaves and the odd broken cup were quickly dumped over the wall of the croquet club.
