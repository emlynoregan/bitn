Burra Hospital

After months of debate between the Hospital Department and the Board, it seems an agreement has been reached to present a plan to the Government to build the whole of the new wing and to house the nurses in the old building for the time being.  The cost is c. Â£60,000, of which the Government will be asked for half.  It will be some time before the Government makes a decision.
