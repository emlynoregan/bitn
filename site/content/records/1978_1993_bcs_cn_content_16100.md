BCS.  Staff Profile: Tony Bryant

I am teaching Computing, Maths and Physics.  For the past eleven years I have taught at Smithfield Plains H.S. and for the three years before that at Elizabeth West and in 1972 at the then sole High School in Pt Augusta.  I gained a BSc (Hons) in Computing at Adelaide University and a Dip Ed.  My Primary and Secondary education was at Clare with Year 12 at Gilles Plains H.S.  I have been a registered competitive swimmer since 1959 and at present am President of the Clare Amateur Swimming Club, a member of the Sa Amateur Swimming Association Country Committee and the SAASA Chief AOD (electronic timer) Operator.  I would like to see the revival of competitive swimming in Burra and of the Burra Swimming Club.  I am willing to give as much assistance as possible to that end.
