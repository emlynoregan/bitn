Burra Town Council, 15 February.

The Mayor reported that police were unable to determine who had vandalised the trees in Jubilee Avenue.

Bon Accord Bridge tenders have been called.

Attention has been drawn to an offensive paragraph derogatory to the Mayor and some members of Council in the Gawler Bunyip, but he thinks it best to treat them with contempt unless the Council decides to proceed against the author.

‘who I have heard is a well-known scribbler living at Burra.’

The tender of A. Miller for gates at the cemetery for £14-10-0 was accepted.

Cr Linkson moved they petition the Commissioner of Public Works for the Government to buy land north of the Railway Station to be cut up into Workingmen’s Blocks.

2nd Cr Rabbich and carried.

Cr Parks then brought up the matter of the libellous and degrading report in the Gawler Bunyip.

Cr Rabbich did not think it Council business.

Cr Parks thought otherwise.

Cr Hardy ‘If the cap fits let them wear it.’

The Mayor, W. West, was keen to get the name of the author of such disgraceful and groundless reports and to take criminal action against him.  His Worship read a paragraph from the Southern Cross in which the proceedings of Council are characterised as very interesting entertainment etc.

Cr Hardy: ‘We should get on with the ratepayer’s business; you don’t know the writer.’

Cr Linkson: ‘Don’t make any mistake about that.’

Cr Watt: ‘If we did we would tar and feather him.’

Cr Hardy: ‘Oh you would.  You might get the tables turned on you.’

Cr Watt: ‘You would not turn the tables.’

Cr Rabbich then threatened to leave the room.

Cr Hardy: ‘Why don’t the Council contradict the statements in the press?’

The Mayor: ‘You appear to be fond of the pen Cr Hardy, will you write contradicting it?’

Cr Hardy: ‘It is not my business - (laughter)’

Cr Linkson then moved the Council write to the editors of the Kapunda Herald, Gawler Bunyip, Southern Cross, and Jamestown Review demanding the name of their Burra correspondent.  Carried.

[Hardy certainly filled this role for each of the named papers at some time and it is clear the others believed him to be the author: he almost certainly was.]
