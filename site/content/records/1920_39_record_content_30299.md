Burra Institute.  Last Monday a very poorly attended meeting of subscribers was held to consider increasing subscription rates.  The proposal was to raise an extra £100 p.a. by increasing the rate from 12/- to 16/- p.a.  Double subscriptions are to remain unchanged.  Carried.

The new dressmaking class on Monday had 17 members in the afternoon and 10 in the evening.

The committee on 8 March [error for 8 April] decided to increase the rental charge for the Burra District Council by £2-10-0 instead of the proposed £5-10-0.
