Wayne Sibly writes an account of his trip.  He was staying with a host family in Berkley Square and getting to know London via the Underground.  He mentions almost daily rain and the smog and recounts visits to the Waxworks, Tower of London, the Zoo, the Shell Oil Refinery and Lord’s Cricket Ground.  They also saw Windsor Castle and the account ends with their visit to Cardiff.
