Burra Burra DC, 2 April.  Mt Bryan Agricultural Bureau suggested that land be bought to build a road from the northern railway crossing at Mt Bryan, along the eastern side of the line, to the township.  This would overcome the problem of SARâ€™s refusal to build a new crossing.  This was dismissed by Council as too expensive.
