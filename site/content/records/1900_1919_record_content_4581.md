Waterworks.

Two years ago they were in a bad way – reliant on one boiler which was in a bad state and the engine was struggling to keep going.  Today the boiler and engine are in thorough order and can be relied on.  The Cornish engine has been repaired.  The smaller boiler has been re-tubed and refitted and the engine thoroughly overhauled and several worn parts replaced.  The worn out iron chimney has been replaced by a new stone one and a cement floor laid in the boiler house.  Close to £200 has been expended and after paying working expenses we have £176-18-3 in hand.  The day is not far off when we will have to provide a larger reservoir as out population will be on the increase.  [This estimate was at least in part based on the reopening of the mine.]  The present reservoir holds only 33,000 gallons.  I would suggest one of 200,000 gallons.  A quarry near the old one could be utilized and the whole done for about £300.  This could store several days’ supply.  William Pryor, in charge of the works, has proved a painstaking and capable officer.
