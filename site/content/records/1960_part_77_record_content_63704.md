In the last week volunteers have cleared weeds from the ‘beak’ yard: presumably the back yard.  Others have done internal repairs and replaced light globes in the hall.  80 attended on the first night and attacked the place with brooms, buckets and household cleansers, after removing large items of rubbish and the old lino.  A formal meeting was followed by supper.
