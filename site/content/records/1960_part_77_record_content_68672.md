Burra Floral Art Group hosted a meeting to aid Red Cross on 26 October.  Mrs R. Lloyd demonstrated making a sheaf of flowers.  Paintings and needlework by Miss Geake were on show.  She was born in Burra and lived here all her life.  Her father was a grocer and later worked in Edwin Harris’s shop.  The family lived in East Street and later in Ayers Street (the house is now Mr Broad’s).  Miss Geake took lessons from Rene Crewes (now Lady McBride) at Kooringa and in 1923 in Adelaide under the late James Ashton.  In 1925 she exhibited an oil painting in Adelaide and won a gold medal.  Paintings sent to London for examination were awarded meritorial certificates.  She taught painting at Kooringa in oil and water colours and also taught the use of pastels and black and white.  Students included Mr L. Bence and the Warner twins from Hallett.  She has always been interested also in needlework, crochet and knitting.  She was a member of the Burra [Cheer-up] Ladies’ Band in WWI, playing the tenor horn. For many years she worked at Wilkinson’s, was connected with the Kooringa Methodist Church and taught at the Sunday school.  We are all pleased to learn that Miss Geake has returned to Burra and wish her well.  The sheaf made by Mrs Lloyd was later delivered to Miss Geake in the Burra Hospital with a card signed by those who came to view her work.

[Doris Minette Edith Geake born 25 January 1891 Kooringa: died 13 April 1974.]
