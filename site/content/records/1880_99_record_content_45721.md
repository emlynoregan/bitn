Editorial on the No-confidence Motion moved by Mr Holder when Parliament opened.  The editor considered it entirely justified, as the Kingston-Playford Government had done little and failed to implement many of its stated policies.  He promises a progressive policy.

2nd Leader on the extraordinary evidence offered by the police at the case in court on Wednesday.  Schutz & Halls were before the court concerning the breaking of lamp glasses, which had been going on for some time.

3rd Leader on the dangers at the Bon Accord crossing.  The authorities promised a gong and then, having done nothing, promised gates, but have failed to deliver them as well.  A few weeks ago a cow was killed and now another incident in which Providence alone can tell how a man and horses were not cut to pieces.  The incline makes it impossible for a train to pull up even if tis driver sees an obstruction on the line in good time.

Mr Field has invited the Mounted Infantry out to his residence on Wednesday 29 June.

The Daulby Fund.  Collecting books are being called in.
