Adchem has announced a record production and sales of copper oxide for the 1999-2000 financial year of 9,125 tonnes.  This is a 25% increase on last year’s record performance.  Simon Kibble, Operations Manager, said this was a great achievement.  The challenge would now be to maintain their competitive advantage in the global market, which could be difficult with the prevailing higher copper prices.  It was important that the company pursue opportunities to expand its market share.  Mark Woodhead, Managing Director, estimated the company hold in excess of 35% of the global market for copper oxide at present.  Their budget for the next financial year was for 8,250 tonnes.  Adchem’s first full year result after acquiring the business from Golden Shamrock Mines Ltd in 1996 was 4,905 tonnes and production has grown every year since.  The company currently employs 32 people.  About $1.2 million is spent annually on capital expenditure and maintenance of the 30 year-old production facility.  The annual revenue for the year was $27 million and came from over 20 countries.  Improved performance comes from a decreased reliance on copper raw material derived solely from mined ore bodies and scrap metal.  The company now has a wide range of raw material suppliers and processes copper-bearing residues and scrap to produce a value added industrial chemical.
