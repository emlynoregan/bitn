Native Grasslands

A project promoting native grasslands has been started in the Mid North.  Millie Nicholls, a farmer near Clare and Ann Prescott, a botanist, are working with landholders, LGAs and other groups to identify grassland remnants, spread information and aid in managing grasslands for grazing and for conservation.  Patches of native grassland are still quite widespread on rough grazing properties, but perhaps only 1% of original grasslands survive; often in paddocks of less than 100 ha.
