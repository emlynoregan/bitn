Remembrance Day in Burra saw only a small crowd at the service at the War Memorial in Market Square.  One reason was the timing on Sunday and another was that the RSL had held a service in the school amphitheatre on Thursday so that the students could attend.  Rev. Michael Hillier [Anglican] officiated.  Photos:
