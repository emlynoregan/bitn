26 July 1989

Hampton Village has now become part of the Burra Heritage Trail and Passport System.  The Council obtained a substantial grant to enable a gate, interpretive signs and consolidation of walls. Etc.  Weed eradication is the final job.  A community working bee has been called to this end on Saturday 6 August from 1 p.m. with a barbecue for workers at 4 p.m.

Mrs Joan Williams will celebrate 25 years of invaluable service to the Burra Hospital on 26 July.

Michelle Meintjes has begun a traineeship with the State Bank.

Adchem (Adelaide chemical Co.) has announced a decision to acquire equipment to allow expansion of its current production line.  The company is already a dominant world producer of Cupric Oxide and Manganous Oxide.  They now intend to add Copper Sulphate Pentahydrate, which is the largest volume copper chemical consumed in the world and copper cement, which is used as a trace element in agriculture.  This will involve an expenditure in excess of $1 million.  General Manager John Downie said the expansion would result in increased employment at the plant and would ensure continuation of the operation for many years.
