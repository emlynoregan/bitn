Obituary.  Mr R. Shuttleworth died at Burra Hospital on 31 May.  He had been believed to be recovering quite well and had been out in the street only the day before his sudden death.  Mr Shuttleworth was manager of the local branch of the Commercial Bank.  Six months ago pleurisy claimed him and complications made him a prisoner of his room.  He was 35 and the only son of his widowed mother, who was a resident of Kooringa while he was manager here.

[Robert Thomas Shuttleworth born 8 April 1900 Prospect.]
