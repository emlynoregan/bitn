New Burra Buildings in 1973 will be worth c. $4 million.

Stage 2 of the treatment Plant at the Burra Mine is estimated to cost over $3 million.

The Burra Hospital will get 40 beds and a new maternity floor, all on one level, at a cost of $220,000.

Barker of Baldina Cottage Homes on the western side of the Hospital are expected to cost c. $90,000.  The late Mr J.R. Barker bequeathed $70,000 and there was a Commonwealth subsidy.

Burra Mine.  Envirotech Australia Pty Ltd is building the multiple hearth furnace for Samin Ltd for the reduction roasting plant and the first two sections of four are being positioned.  [Photograph.]  The plant will cost $1.2 million; will be c. 26 ft in diameter and 85 ft high.  It will be a 12 hearth, multiple hearth type furnace and will be equipped for recovering heat from the furnace flue, gases and roasted ore, together with cyclonic and bag type dust collection and should be operational this year.  It will calcine 1,000 tons of crushed ore per day, using natural gas as fuel.  Parts of the roaster came from Adelaide by two low loaders operated by J.W. Bourne Ltd.  The width forced a roundabout route via Snowtown, Gladstone, Crystal Brook, Jamestown and Hallett and took two days with lifting of overhead wires taking much of the time.  The third and fourth sections arrived on Wednesday after a similar journey.

Barker Cottage Homes are progressing satisfactorily.  So far seven applications have been received by the Board of Management and this leaves two vacant units.  Construction is by the local firm of D.T. Jacka & Co. and it is expected that the units will be ready for occupation by the end of March or early April.  One advantage will be the nearness to the Hospital.  [Photograph.]

Burra Hospital extensions will incorporate a new Maternity Wing, kitchen and staff dining room, as well as three additional share wards and a childrenâ€™s ward for the General Hospital.  All will be on the same level.  [The old hospital had always been plagued by different levels throughout.]  The new wing will include three private wards, a share ward, nursery and a TV room for patients.  The existing verandah on the front of the building will be extended on the eastern end to link with the new building and on the western end a new sunroom for patients will be erected.  Kennett Bros of Adelaide are expected to complete the work in April or May.  The area under the built-up building will house rain water tanks.  [Photograph.]
