The Weekly Exercise Class for seniors at St Mary’s Hall has become quite popular.  Jan Tiver helped to start the class in 2003.  After initial interest the numbers fell away, but recently have settled at about a more satisfactory 15.

Burra Antique Fair went well, with good crowds in attendance.

Inclement Weather reduced crowds at the Gold Club’s auction.
