Merrie Elliott of Booborowie writes to express her relief that the doctor situation at the Burra Hospital has been resolved.  She is also concerned about the title to the hospital, which carries the provision that the land must be used for a hospital.  She is fearful of there being a smart legal subterfuge that would enable the land to be sold off or used for another purpose.  She urges attendance at a concert 15 October in Burra Town Hall by Paul O’Bryan to raise funds for the hospital.  And urges vigilance on the hospital front to forestall and hidden agenda from depriving the town of this vital facility.
