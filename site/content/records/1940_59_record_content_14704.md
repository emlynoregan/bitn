Booborowie Centenary.  [Continued from 63, 32, 17 Aug. 1943, page 4.]

To the south and east of Booborowie Station was an expanse of flat and undulating country well suited to agriculture and mixed farming.  Apparently this was never part of the station or it was resumed when the Hundred of Ayers was created and in the late 1860s intrepid pioneers moved in with names like McWaters, Giles, Finch, Spencer, Skewes, Holder, McEllister & Gemmel.  They clearly intended staying as they asked for a DC and the petition of 1874 saw the first DC meet in 1875.  The first members of it were H. Skewes, W. Hastie, A. Pearce, A. Spencer, J. Finch & R. Giles and the last was elected Chairman with William Novice as first District Clerk.  A rate of 9d in the pound was declared.  On 26 February 1876 M. Terry, mail contractor on the route from Burra to Blinman, applied for repairs to the road between Devil’s Hole Creek and the Booborowie Eating House.  The mail then crossed the creek near the end of Forest Reserve and continued down the valley near J. Howard’s property, through A.T. McWater’s and past the Council Office.

In 1876 the Burra-Booborowie Road was declared a main road.  Booborowie was to be the junction with the Farrell’s Flat and Stone Hut Road.  A pound was erected in 1875 and entrusted to Thomas Reynolds 7 October 1875.

On 18 December 1876 James Burden became the first pound-keeper, though without remuneration.  There was a move to give the Council a permanent home at Baldry in 1876 and tenders were called for the erection of a Council Office there.  Mr H. Jolly won the tender for £125 and the first meeting was held there 20 June 1877.

In the election that followed the secret ballot was used for the first time and elected Messrs J. Armstrong, W.J. Langsford, J. Finch, A. Threadgold & J. Spencer.  John McAskill was appointed Clerk at 10/- a week.  Thomas Reynold was overseer.  A post office was first mentioned in 1877 and in 1878 R. Giles was appointed Council Clerk at £50 p.a. and for another £30 acted as overseer.
