The John Wesley Bi-Centenary was celebrated at Burra this week.  A convention and public meeting was held at Kooringa in addition to Sunday services.  The weekday part was held on Monday 15 June.

Convention – Rev. T.B. Anguin presided and Adjutant Dodd of the Salvation Army offered the opening prayer.  Rev. W.F. James read a paper on Methodism; a Revival of Early Christianity.

Public Meeting – R. Snell offered the opening prayer.  Mr Davey, who attended the centenary of Methodism in Cornwall 64 years ago, presided and spoke and Rev. A.H. Melbourne spoke on Methodism and the Young.

S. Burns spoke on Methodism in Burra.  When Rev. D.J. Draper opened the first Wesleyan Church in Burra there was no place of worship for 70 miles.  Services began at Redruth in 1851 and R. Reed, who is still alive, wheeled the mortar for the first church built there.  Rev. J.G. Wright was the first Primitive Methodist preacher and James Blutchford [sic] [Blatchford] was the first Bible Christian preacher in 1848, but the church was nearly paid for before the first Bible Christian minister arrived in Rev. J. Rowe.  There was a great revival under Rev. J. Way – one meeting lasted from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m.  Matthew Burnet did much to foster the spirit of unity among the three Methodist Churches. In Canada, Australia and New Zealand there was a move for union with the Presbyterians.

Tea was served between the Convention and the Public Meeting.  After expenses the collection produced £1-1-8 for the Burra Benevolent Soc.
