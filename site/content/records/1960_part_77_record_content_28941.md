Burra National Trust held its AGM at Burra Town Hall on 5 April.  Elected: President, A. Tennant; Vice-President, S.J. Woollacott; Treasurer, Miss Marcia Tiver and Secretary, Miss Mary Woollacott.

The Trust is still collecting items and donations for its Market Square Museum project.  The appeal will close on 29 April, with the opening of the museum scheduled for late September.

The President’s Report

The Trust wishes to see Paxton Square preserved and made enquiries about taking over from the Lewis Trust.  This revealed that it would be likely to involved long and costly legal proceedings and so further action has been deferred indefinitely.  The Trust appreciates the moving of the jinker to its present central site.

Dower’s old shop was purchased by the President for $1,000 and presented to the National Trust Burra Branch free of encumbrances.  The title is held by Headquarters, but control of the building and its maintenance rests with the Burra Branch.  The cost of repairs has been $1,186.  This is much more than anticipated, but involved repairs common to old buildings to most of the guttering and the complete replastering of the front room.  A wall was removed to make a good-sized room for display.  The three other rooms have not yet had work done on them and in time they will need replastering and new floors due to termite damage.  Headquarters loaned $420 for repairs (to be paid back without interest).  The appeal for funds so far has realised $895.80 of the $1,600 aimed for.

Some gifts for display have been received for which the Trust is appreciative.

Trust Headquarters feels that the dugouts are in such a poor state of repair that maintenance is beyond the present finances of the branch.  Headquarters is also addressing the old Reformatory and is contacting the appropriate authorities to prevent demolition.
