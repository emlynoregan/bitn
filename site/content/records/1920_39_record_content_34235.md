I.C. Hall, baker of Aberdeen, [Redruth] found a young lad on his premises last Friday night about 10 p.m.  When questioned he seemed dazed, but said he got in to take some money he had seen there.  He gave no other explanation and as he was previously of good character he was given a good behaviour bond of Â£20 until he was 18.
