Obituary.  George Brown who died 9 October was born in 1862 and his parents then lived at Canowie and then for some years at Jamestown.  In 1898 Mr Brown went to work for Sir John Duncan at Gum Creek and later for the Hon. W. Duncan.  Ill health forced his retirement about 6 years ago.  He married Miss Mary Dunning of Leasingham who survives with six sons and three daughters: William (Jamestown), Tom & George (Burra), Harry (Gum Creek), Clarrie (Magill), Walter (Booborowie), Miss Dorothy (Adelaide), and Misses Maude & May (Burra).  There are a number of grandchildren.  Five of the sons not six saw service in the Great War.
