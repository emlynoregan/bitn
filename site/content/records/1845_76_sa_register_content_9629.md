The Main North Road

£1,616 has been expended on this road and with a trifling exception it has all been expended between Bowden and Gawler.  Some 6¾ miles of previously unmade road have been metalled 18 ft wide and other repairs done.  There remains 7¼ miles of roadway to be metalled.  The cost cannot be less than £1,400 per mile. The fact that almost the entire distance has now been fenced makes improvement essential.  Several un-metalled portions will become impassable in winter.  Some of the old metalled sections are becoming very worn, even though the work was very thoroughly done originally.  From Gawler to Burra nothing at all has been done except for a grant towards making a ford over the Dirty Light near Hamilton.  The defects between Gawler and Kapunda saw a survey made last year, but the high costs have so far proved a bar.  The bridge and approaches over the Light near the Miners’ Arms are about to be commenced.  Quite a length of road south of Bagot’s Gap is being fenced, which will certainly be impassable next winter.

On the branch to Clare a little over £12,000 was spent in 1855.  The new bridge and approaches over the Light at the Burra Company’s crossing are complete also the new bridge and approaches over the Gilbert near Forrester’s.  A new line of road has been opened near Forrester’s, another between Baker’s public house and Auburn and a third between Leasingham and Watervale.  A bridge has been built over Jacob’s Creek by the District Council of Clare, by means of a grant from the Board.  Nevertheless, only a trifling distance along this road has been metalled.  Fencing along this route will also render parts impassable in winter.
