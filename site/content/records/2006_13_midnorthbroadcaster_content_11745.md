Burra Town Hall & Railway Station Restoration Work

An upcoming ABC television program will acknowledge the work carried out by volunteers in these two areas, especially that of Roy Taplin.  Filming took place at the Town Hall and railway station.  ABC presenter Simon Royal interviews volunteers.  Mr Taplin is the project manager at the station, which has received a new roof and other much needed attention with the help of local tradespeople and volunteers.
