Burra Kindergarten.  AGM & Report on activities.

We hope to arrange a visit from Predator Park this term, to provide hands-on experience with animals and birds.

Bobby Brown, an Aboriginal artist from Clare visited recently.

There has been a focus on healthy eating and a nurse from the Clare Dental Clinic helped to reinforce this message.

Different eating experiences will be offered through the year.  So far the children have experienced a creek picnic, breakfast at Kindy, tea at Kindy for father’s night and an end of term party.  A barbecue and further breakfast experiences are planned.

BCS is visited weekly to familiarise the children with the ‘big school’ and there is story time in the library.

Visits to the BCS agricultural centre.

Visit from the Mt Bryan Primary School and return visit to them.

Elected for coming year: Chairperson Diana Agnew; Secretary, Jane Parker; Treasurer, Kerry Eldredge and Fundraising, Marie Kibble.
