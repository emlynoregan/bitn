Court.

Among others Thomas Woollacott was fined Â£1-2-6 for allowing his cow and horse to stray.

[This is an unusually large amount: but then he was a frequent visitor to court for this offence.]

Thomas Bewley reported to M-C Grosser on Monday that two of his horses had been stabbed.  One was dead and the other not so badly cut and will probably survive.  An investigation showed that they had in fact rolled on broken glass.

Offence.  Two mischievous little girls visited the Redruth Reformatory fowl house the other day and smashed a number of valuable eggs on which ducks were setting.  Prosecution of Clara Carpenter and Florrie Jones is being considered.
