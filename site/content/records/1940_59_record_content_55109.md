CWA Avenue.  The remaining 50 trees to complete the CWA Avenue at the entrance to the town from Hanson have now been planted.  The Council planted the trees, which were financed by the CWA.  Several of last yearâ€™s trees that had been eaten by stray sheep were replaced.  Approximately 150 trees have been planted around Burra by the Council, 50 of them at the Memorial Oval.
