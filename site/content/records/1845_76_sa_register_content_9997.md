Kooringa News

Mr Frederick Gurney, the mail driver, was presented on Monday evening with a drab driving-coat, a pair of long boots, a souâ€™ wester, and a tandem whip, by several persons interested in the early arrival of the mail, as a mark of their appreciation of his services as driver of the mail for the last three years.
