Burra Swimming Pool

The pool has now been fibre-glassed, renovated and filled.  It will open on Tuesday or earlier depending on the cleaning of the water.  The wading pool has also been fibre-glassed and the dressing rooms renovated, following an Australian Government grant towards costs.  Season tickets cost $12 for a family, $X single and $3 child.  $250 has been transferred from the canteen fund to the Council.
