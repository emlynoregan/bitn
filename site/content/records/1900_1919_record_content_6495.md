Burra Show on 24 September was a great success, though the morning was windy and dusty.  The afternoon was somewhat better.  Attendance was good with a gate of £63, down £3 on last year.  Side shows and Cheap Jacks were more numerous.  Not so much agricultural produce was entered, but good dairy produce.  Poultry numbers were down because young birds were omitted this year.  Draught stock was well represented as were ponies.  Cattle were not plentiful and dogs about the same as last year.  Mr Duncan’s Berkshire boar was an attraction and the largest ever seen in the town at about 550 lb.  It had also got first prize at the recent Adelaide Show.  Implements and vehicles were well shown; especially notable were the vehicles of Mr Maxwell of Manoora.  C. & W. Oppermann had their own way in vegetables.  Flowers were poor: no doubt due to the bad season.
