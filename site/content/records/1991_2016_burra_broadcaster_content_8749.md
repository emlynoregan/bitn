Burra Burra DC

Council is investigating supplying water to BCS ovals from its No. 2 bore because water pressure at the school has been poor for some time.

Council wishes to renew operations at the West Street Quarry.

Thamms have been asked to submit the colour scheme for exposed steel columns and external timbers and a landscaping plan with species and location of trees and shrubs that will screen the proposed rebuilt garage from Watt Road, Ludgvan Street and Young Street, once they have grown.

The Nursing Mothersâ€™ Association will be asked for guidance concerning the needs for baby changing and feeding facilities in Burra.

A gate will be placed across the road leading to the Kindergarten car park and will be locked except during school hours.

Council agreed to lend the Leighton Cricket Club $1,500 to replace its vandalised pitch.
