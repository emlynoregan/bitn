Sir Samuel Way has written to Mrs Lally and sent a winter shawl as thanks for the interest she has taken in his welfare when he required a serious operation recently.  [From the fact she had lost an arm at an advanced age and her sympathy was extended to him in like circumstances it would seem he had an amputation.  He would be 79 on 11 April.]
