‘A Warning Voice’ writes to the editor:

He complains that those employed at the Burra Mine are being compelled to share in the loss resulting from the fall in the copper price or a decline in the yield by reduced wages, but should prosperity return and dividends increase they are not to share in them; ‘for the Directors would then do what they have always done, namely avail themselves of every chance to lower wages.  I am sure you will think “ ‘It’s werry unekle,’ as my father says, when his grog isn’t half and half, ‘It’s werry unekle, Samivel.’ ” I am, Sir, &c., A WARNING VOICE.’
