Adelaide-Burra Cycle Race.  J. Conyers was first and fastest in 5 hours 51 minutes 2.2 seconds.  He is aged 41 and his win is notable in that he fell early, injuring several ribs and had chain troubles towards the end, having to replace it six times in the last few miles.  On the outskirts of Burra he was 50 yards behind, but gained the lead just 200 yards from the finish.  The trophy was presented at the dance in the RSL Hall in the evening, by the Mayor Mr W. Carpenter.  The prize money is a small £25.  The Adelaide-Pt Pirie race has £160 in prize money of which £50 is first prize.
