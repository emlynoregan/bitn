Fire.  At 11 p.m. on Monday night while closing up the Commercial Hotel Miss Vivian noted sparks coming from a chimney that appeared to be at the back of P. Callahan’s house.  She told M-C Grosser who discovered the back room of Mr Pederson’s boot shop was alight.  He broke in and just managed to extinguish the flames with buckets of water before they got to the canvas ceiling.  Mr Vivian assisted and then went and told Mr Pederson.  William Pederson said he had burnt rubbish in the fireplace about 6 p.m. and believing the fire to be extinguished had then placed other debris in the fireplace.  Apparently this smouldered and then caught alight.  Sparks from this, or from the chimney catching alight, in turn ignited the boards.
