Editorial on Farming.  It discussed recent poor seasons and Government aid, which has had to be paid back leaving some farmers worse off than ever.  The subdivision of the Shafton Estate has brought more families into the area.  Modern machinery means that cleaning, winnowing, sorting and bagging are things of the past: the reaper does the lot and can even save the wheaten chaff if necessary.

Weather.  The seasonâ€™s most severe frost was last Thursday.

Tomorrow is the third anniversary of the great snow fall in which drifts up to 6ft high were recorded.
