Booborowie School Sports were held on the ‘Celebration of Children’s Day’ 3 September.  The Head Teacher began with an address on the history of Booborowie illustrated with photographs of events.  A series of competitions followed and a round of mystery parcels, and then sports before the children were dismissed for the day.  [The sports results are printed.]
