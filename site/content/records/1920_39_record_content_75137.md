Burra Institute.

H.J. Emslie, representative of the SA Institutes’ Association, visited Burra recently and praised the local Institutes.  He made nice references to those at Farrell’s Flat, Hanson and Hallett, but said Burra’s reading room was probably the best equipped in the state.  This has long been believed by many and 50 years ago Sir Frederick Holder was holding it up as an example to others.

Farrell’s Flat has brightened its premises and installed an electric light plant and now has 17 or 18 members.  At Hanson an effort is being made to build a supper room and £80-90 is in hand.  Building is not to start till all the money has been raised.

At Burra hundreds of books have been culled and the collection is the better for their passing.  All committees should cull old, worn and useless books.  With a large mortgage the committee approached the Town Council and £60 was forthcoming from the rates.  Only when such mortgages are paid off can committees expect to make headway.  The reading room is possibly the best equipped in SA.  A handsome honour roll adorns the room.  The local paper gives much support by publishing Institute news and listing books added and on loan.

Mt Bryan Institute has long been inactive and Mr Emslie was afraid it would have to go.  It is a pity, but it seems quite useless to maintain a library for fewer than six readers.  They would be better served by paying subscriptions to, say, Burra and having supplies sent along regularly.

Hallett has a magnificent hall and owes only about £800 of the original cost after 10 years.  Its benefactor the late Sir John Melrose is greatly missed.
