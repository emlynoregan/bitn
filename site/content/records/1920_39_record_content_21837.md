E.W. Crewes writes re Returned Soldiers.  He is complaining of Government action demanding from some soldier settlers a registered lien or bill of sale over the whole of the growing crops, ignoring the claims of the men and also of creditors like butchers, bakers, saddlers and other storekeepers who have kept the men going.  Some signed, others refused in order to offer each creditor a fair proportion.  The Government has retaliated by cancelling their leases.  The law condemns making preferential creditors of any person, so is the Government action right or justifiable?
