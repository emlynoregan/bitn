A Bolt.  On Thursday morning a cart was being driven to Copperhouse School by Frank Beinke, with Shirley Stockman, when the harness became loose and the horse bolted.  It careered about a mile, turned into the narrow road to the school at speed and continued some 300 yards up the hill before freeing itself from the harness.  The shafts dug into the ground and the passengers were thrown over the front, being lucky to escape serious injury.  A few yards further on a small creek crosses the road and had they encountered that the result could have been very different.
