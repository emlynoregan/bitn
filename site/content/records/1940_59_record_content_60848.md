Town Council Assessment.  There were numerous appeals against the new assessment.  Results have not been announced, but we donâ€™t expect any successes as the values were based on E & WS valuations, against which there were no appeals.  The problem was that the Council had not increased the assessment gradually as property values rose and owners were then confronted with a large leap in values.
