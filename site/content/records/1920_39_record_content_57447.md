A Centenary Committee was formed last Tuesday.  It was resolved to hold celebrations in Burra 2 October to 8 October inclusive, provided the Show Committee would work with the Centenary Committee.  A ‘Back to Burra’ celebration is to be a feature.  A sub-committee was appointed to draw up a rough program.  Next committee meeting set for 28 August.
