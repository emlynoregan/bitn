Report of the Davenport Bros. who were bound and placed in a box but apparently played instruments (The cabinet séance)

Professor Fay also bound, but in the dark played instruments which were phosphorus painted and appeared to float above the audience E.D. Davies was a ventriloquist.

A good house first night, but poor for 2nd.
