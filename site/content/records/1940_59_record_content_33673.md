Cycling: The riders from Clare were registered with the League of Wheelmen and the locals were not.  Clare riders were thus not allowed to compete with the others, but a special 2-mile race was organised for them and won by R. Victor.  Other results:

½-mile sprint won by Bob Angel

2-mile race won by C. Todd.  In this race unfortunately a basketball from the girls’ events rolled onto the track and was struck by John Wohling who was thrown heavily.  Though the rider was not much hurt his bike was damaged.

½-mile Race for Veterans (Over 55 yrs) was won by Phillips.
