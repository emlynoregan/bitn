Gladstone Gaol.  Charles McCarthy was sentenced to one month at Laura on 6 June, for the theft of certain articles of clothing.  As the first prisoner in the new Gladstone Gaol ‘it is understood [he] will be presented with a watch by the Gladstone community in memoriam of the festive occasion.’

[The editor of the Record was horrified at this ‘monstrous absurdity’.]
