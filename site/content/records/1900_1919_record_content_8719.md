Burra Burra Copper Co.  The fourth quarterly report.  Since the general meeting in April the Electro-Magnetic Separation Co. has made several trial runs with its separating plant and has sent over 100 tons of concentrate away to Wallaroo.  The trials have satisfied them that the plant needs certain crushing appliances available only from the USA and pending their arrival work has been suspended.  The directors of the Burra Burra Copper Co. are considering the unwatering of the mineâ€™s open cut to allow more ore bearing ground to be worked.  Presently there are 8 tribute pitches let and the Magnetic Co. has the right of search over a block to the northwest of the open cut and they are employing seven men sinking and driving.
