A severe thunderstorm, the worst for many years lasted some two hours on Thursday.  [The rest of the article suggests it occurred in the early hours of Friday morning.]  Rain fell in torrents and overflowed guttering, flooded ceilings and rooms.  Friday was also wet with more thunder and lightning in the evening.  The creek came down a banker.  Silt piled up at some footbridges and caused water to divert, causing other damage.  At Leighton lightning ignited hay on the property of Mrs S. Pearce. Though prompt action prevented serious damage.
