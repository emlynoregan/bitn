Burra Cricket Association met on 7 September and was adjourned to 24 September and again to 2 October and then to 7 October.  The problem was essentially financial, with an attempt to get Mt Bryan to hand over £7-19-4, being half the proceeds of an Association concert held at Mt Bryan on 25 April 1923.  Mt Bryan resolved to keep the balance they held.  The Association had £3-16-0 and outstanding accounts for £11-10-0.  The balance sheet was adopted with a debt of £7-19-4 standing against Mt Bryan.

The President, I.J. Warnes, resigned saying he could not carry on another year.

C.B. Tiver was appointed Secretary.  Booborowie North was admitted to the Association.  Matches in the coming season are to be one-day matches.  Matches between Kooringa and North Booborowie are to be played at South Booborowie.
