Mongolata Goldfield

Prospectors continue to work and say they are satisfied.  At present 20 to 30 men are at work.  H.A. Byles recently had 2 tons 12 cwt treated at Peterborough and obtained gold 10 oz 2 dwt & by cyanide 11 dwt 16 grains.  The trouble is the lack of crushing facilities which at present makes it only worthwhile sending the best ore to Peterborough.
