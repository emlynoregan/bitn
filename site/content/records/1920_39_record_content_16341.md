The Visit of the Premier Hon. J. Gunn to Booborowie, 3 July

Messrs Hawke, McHugh, Condon & Stannaford arrived on time and were taken to Booborowie Experimental Farm to see stock and the making of concrete posts.  The Premier was delayed until evening.  Mr A.D. McDonald spoke of the district going backwards through the lack of a railway, while Hill River and Spalding went ahead.

W.J. Cousins spoke of some of the practical difficulties for the small farmer.

A document from F. Hogan was read putting the District Council’s case: the present road maintenance system was unworkable and a railway was needed.  He gave facts and figures relating distance and costs of roads, their construction and maintenance.

P. Carey spoke in support on behalf of business people in Booborowie and he was supported by A. Pearce & J. Heinricks.

F.C. Catt as secretary of the movement also spoke.

The Premier was prepared to grant the request, but the matter had to go to the Railways Standing Committee.  The first time the matter was raised the estimated cost was £163,000 and it was thought it would not pay.  In 1922 the cost was estimated at £244,000, but he promised to put it to the committee again.

Speeches then followed from Mr Blesing, Mr Stannaford, Mr Condon and then again from the Premier, this time of a more general political nature.
