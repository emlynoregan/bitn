BCS.  Fifty-four people including staff, bus drivers, relieving teachers, swimming pool manager and eleven physical education students completed a six-hour Basic Casualty Care Training Session on Friday, run by Allison Tandy and Eunice Mills.  Friday 13 was a student free day to enable this to be run â€“ staff are required to update their training every two years.  There will be a combined Lower North Schools Training and Development Day on 20 June, which has been negotiated with the School Council as a student free day.  The planned strike by the SA Institute of Teachers Union on 24 May will not affect BCS as union members here voted not to take part.
