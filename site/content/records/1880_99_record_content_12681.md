Editorial on Mr Rounsevell’s Speech.

Rounsevell advocated a progressive land tax without a minimum, beginning at 5%* and then an income tax at 3d in the £ from £300 to £1,000, 3½d from there to £2,000, 4d on the next £1,000 and so on in £1,000 steps to 1/- in the £.  He also wanted the gradual removal of subsidies to Councils and a stamp duty.  All this would amount to over £1 per head for every man, woman and child over the existing taxation.  Let us hope such a policy is never put in place.

[* This is not correct: see the correction offered in V, 326, 4 April 1884, p.2]
