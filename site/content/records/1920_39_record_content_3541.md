Obituary.  William Cockrum died at his daughter’s residence at Mt Bryan on 3 March.  He was born at Hemerdon Devonshire in 1839 and was the eldest son of Mr & Mrs Gabriel Cockrum, late of Cartapoo Hallett.  He came to Australia in the old man-o-war The Nile reaching Pt Adelaide on 4 May 1865 after over 90 days at sea.  He worked at the Burra Mine before East Will Mining and also at Ballarat.  He then took up land at Cartapoo, then McCoy’s Well and once owned Nillinghoo Station and also owned property at Shafton and was for a time in partnership with his brother-in-law T.H. Pearse at ‘The Gums’.  In 1897 he sold his stations and turned again to mining.  His family went to Kensington and he went to Menzies WA and then made two trips to the NT for gold.  On the first he was speared by blacks and on the second one of the Afghan camel drivers killed one of the party and then perished from thirst when he fled.  He married the eldest daughter of the late George Hiles of Petherton, Hallett who died nine years ago.  On the death of Miss Roda [Rhoda] Cockrum he went to live with his eldest daughter Mrs George Beckwith.  Six children survive: W.G.H. Cockrum (Normanville), P.J. Cockrum (Pt Lincoln), Mrs George Beckwith (Mt Bryan), Mrs J.R. Simpson (Mt Bryan), Mrs F.I. Bath (Kensington Gardens) & Mrs A.W. Kinner (Rose Park).  There are several grandchildren.
