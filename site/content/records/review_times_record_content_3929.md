Accident.  A Falcon station wagon was written off last month at the intersection of the Clare road and the Barrier Highway at Hanson.  It was driven by a local schoolteacher and collided with a trailer being towed by a 4WD utility.  The intersection was redesigned about six months ago.  Local tow truck operator Mr Des Woolley predicts it will be the scene of a fatal accident if stop or give way signs are not erected.
