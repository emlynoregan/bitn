W. Paxton

Amongst our most recent departures we note that of Mr W. Paxton Esq. who returns home by the overland route, having taken his passage by the John Banks to Ceylon.  A large number of friends and old colonists gathered to bid him farewell before his embarkation.

Mr G.H. Fox, merchant of Adelaide, also left for England in the same vessel.
