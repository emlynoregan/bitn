Burra Burra Show Inc.  AGM 5 March

President I.J. Warnes reported on the year.

The death of A.J. McBride while on holiday in South Africa was a great loss to the society.  Though not on the committee, his advice was of great help and his assistance valuable.  He lent the equipment to get the show ring made and was an active member for many years.

Elections.  There were three nominations for the three vacancies on the Finance Committee.  There being no nominations for President, Mr Warnes assumed the society was willing for him to continue.  The Sheep Dog Trials on 29 & 30 April were held in cold wet weather.  Entries were good and the competition keen.

The show on 7 & 8 October was held in glorious weather.  This was a month earlier and moved to the end of the week instead of the middle.  Both moves were successful.

Changes to the wool section saw entries rise from 3 to 30 and changes to the sheep section to encourage small producers to enter were successful.

£217-19-11 is in hand to put against the president’s £250 £ for £ for a sheep shed, but the dry season has meant we decided not to worry members till things improve.

Mr Dixon has done a good gob as caretaker.

M.S. Edwards has given great support as secretary.

Improvements this year have been mainly to the kitchens, costing £58-15-0.

Once again the Adelaide train ran at a loss.

[The Terowie train is not specifically mentioned, so presumably it ran at a profit.  The loss on the train guarantee was £57-14-0.]

Profit on the actual Show Day was £169-4-2 and the loss on the Dog Trials was £32-16-3, leaving an overall profit of £136-7-11.
