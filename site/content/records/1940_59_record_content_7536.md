Rev. Dr M.F. Toal, who has been in charge of the Parish of St Joseph in Burra, is leaving here on Thursday to take up duties as a Chaplain for the Military Authorities.  In his time here he has endeared himself not only to his own parishioners, but to the community generally.  A token of appreciation was presented to him after Mass last Sunday.
