Accident.  On Saturday night Mr C. Attrill of Kooringa drove his charabanc into the wall of the home of the keeper of the refreshment rooms at the Burra Station when he went to meet the 10.50 p.m. train.  The building was considerably damaged and the vehicle completely wrecked.  Two passengers, Messrs M. Dobson & C. Waddy of the Bank of Australasia & the National Bank respectively, were thrown out and required stitches to head wounds.  [A third passenger was unharmed or severely bruised, as described in two successive sentences.]

Mr Attrill fractured his skull and sustained severe lacerations to his head, but there are hopes he will recover.
