Burra Golf Club

Last Monday club and on-loan equipment was stolen from the equipment shed.  There have now been three break-ins in four weeks, with the loss of equipment and plant with a replacement value in excess of $20,000.  The last break-in resulted in the loss of two ride-on mowers, a whipper-snipper, pressure cleaner, jerry cans, irrigation equipment, communications cable and sundry tools.  The public is asked for help in recovery of the same.  Insurance will not cover all this and the penalties for making a claim will be significant.  The irrigation system is to be commissioned this week.
