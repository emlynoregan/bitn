Mr Steele Hall, Liberal Movement Leader, addressed a gathering in Burra on Wednesday evening.  He spoke of the urgent need for change within the LCL.  The League had failed to attract the metropolitan voters.  It has allowed an image to be formed that it is a party of privilege and of the Establishment, with no belief in the common man.  The Liberal Movement aims to break this image.  He had resigned as leader of the LCL because the party was not willing to embrace the change needed to win city seats.
