Hanson Methodist Church.  The Christmas Day tea meeting drew 140 from Burra by train and others in buggies etc.  Rev. Yeoman and Messrs Woollacott & Bray addressed the crowd and the choir rendered some splendid singing before supper was served.  In total the anniversary functions raised Â£14-16-6 which was considered very satisfactory.
