The Burra Mine Site

Ratepayers’ Action Group has also lodged a submission with PIRSA on the Phoenix application to lift the Burra Mine Reserve.

The submission begins with an outline of RAG’s objectives and some of the issues it has addressed in the past.  RAG is concerned that the minutes on the Council on 22 January 2008 show that Mr Dowd of Phoenix addressed Council on the intentions of the company for mining in the Burra region, but no other information is given, neither has there been any media coverage from then till a public notice in the Mid North Broadcaster in May 2010.  Much space is then devoted to a critique of the public meeting [of 5 July 2010].  The conclusion is that despite contrary views in the community RAG is opposed to the lifting of the reserve and that many residents are largely ignorant of Burra’s history and heritage and its importance to the town.  RAG blames the Council for doing little to emphasize the economic benefits of tourism to the community and the international importance of ‘The Burra Charter’.  If an exploration licence is granted the company should expect ‘a watchful community during the exploration phase and a helluva fight should a mining licence be subsequently sought’.
