St Joseph’s Church.  Last Sunday the additions to the school were blessed and opened.  The weather conditions were perfect.  The ceremony was performed by His Lordship the Most Rev. T. McCabe DD, Bishop of Pt Augusta.  Mass was celebrated at 8.30 and 11 a.m. with the re-opening function at 2.30 p.m.  Rev. Dr Toal introduced the visiting clergy and after his welcome the Mayor extended a Civic Welcome and then P.J. Byrne welcomed the Bishop on behalf of the congregation.  Rev. Father Neasdale was especially welcomed as the priest who began the moves to have the just-completed work done.  P.W. Hogan & J.L. Connors also spoke in support.  The Bishop’s speech is reported at length.  Rev. J. Forster SJ, Supervisor of Sevenhills College then made an appeal for funds.  He began with a history of St Joseph’s.

In 1852 Clare was given into the hands of Rev. Murphy SJ – Clare was then the only Diocese. [?]

In 1853 Kooringa was included in it.

The first priest was Fr Krau, who visited Kooringa monthly till 1856.  [Other sources say the first visiting priest was Rev. Aloysius Kranewitter SJ]

The following year the 1st Mass was said in Howley’s Cottage in Paxton’s Square.

Father Kreissl [1870-84] afterwards bought a house in Chapel St, blessed it and took charge for 10 years.

A church and school was built in Commercial St on a site presented by SAMA.

In 1873 the present church was erected at a cost of £3,300.

[Warning: all this historical information needs to be checked for dates, names and their spelling as Rev. Forster differs from other sources.]

The appeal immediately raised £108-2-6.
