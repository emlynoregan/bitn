Characteristics of the paper for 1933

This year the paper was particularly full of local news.

Page 1

This was dominated by news with a few large local advertisements.

Page 2

This carried large advertisements for Drew & Crewes and Bence’s along with smaller advertisements and notices, especially of sales and local government activities, public meetings and the like.  Talkies and classified advertisements were also found here.  Some news is generally found here, but late on the page.

Page 3

Several large advertisements especially by Matthews and Sara & Co. dominate the advertising, but it is mostly given over to news.
