Mongolata Goldfield

The paper prints a paragraph complaining at the lack of publicity for the Mongolata Goldfield in the Adelaide press, despite its claims producing up to 15-16oz per ton.  It contrasts with all the hype printed over ‘The Granites’, which produced virtually no gold.

The paper also noted that Mr Richards, then Minister for Mines, managed to give £10,000 to Wallaroo for copper promotion in a year when copper could not be sold and when Mongolata had been substantially responsible for SA having its highest gold production since 1919.

Gold is not confined to one claim at Mongolata.  Pexton’s also has rich ore at grass.  At Curlew £1,800 worth has been obtained in four months and Wildildie and others are making progress.  Why the pendulum has swung in favour of aiding copper when there is no copper market is a mystery.

Mr G.E. Down of Adelaide drew only a small audience to his illustrated lecture on the war at the Institute on 8 March.

A Rev. H.S. Jarvis memorial service was held at Kooringa Methodist Church last Sunday.  The church, which holds about 500, was filled.  Rev. F.J. Barnes of Redruth conducted the service.  There was an enlarged choir of 35 under Mr Dane.
