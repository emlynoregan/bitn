Local Board of Health met last Saturday to consider the case of John Reed and his wife.  Mr John Sampson explained the matter was urgent.  The couple could not go on living in such a manner, as it was dangerous to neighbours and themselves.  His evidence was corroborated by Messrs O’Leary, Watt, Rabbich and W. Hardy.  Both Reed and his wife had been sent to Adelaide Hospital, but had found their way back.  Notice was given to the property owner to clean it up and steps will be taken at once to get Mr Reed to Adelaide Hospital and Mrs Reed to the Destitute Asylum.
