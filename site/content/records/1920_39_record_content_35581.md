W.J.C. Ewins had worked with Mr Tiddy 42 years earlier at Bath & Pearce’s.  A.L. Walker also supported the above sentiments.  The Mayor handed over a wallet of notes from the town and also one from Kooringa Methodism.  Mr Tiddy responded.

[R. Fuss was among a long list of people apologising for their absence.]
