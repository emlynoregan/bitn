The Burra Burra Mines

The associated purchasers of the two blocks of land immediately north and south of the Burra Burra Special Survey, who paid deposits of 10% at the Treasury, have forfeited their deposits.  Presumably they have concluded that the land was unlikely to fulfil the expectations of the proprietors.

Shares in the Burra Burra Mine continue to increase in value.  J.B. Neales was recently commissioned to sell ten £5 shares and found a ready buyer at £290 or £29 per share.
