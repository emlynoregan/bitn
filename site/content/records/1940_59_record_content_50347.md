Offensive behaviour.  A recent visitor to the town made a nuisance of himself at local hotels and was denied both drink and accommodation at them as a result.  Constable Chambers was surprised to arrive home on Sunday evening to see smoke from his kitchen chimney.  He found the unwelcome guest in his kitchen, about to eat the mushrooms the constable had collected, that had been cooked with the departmentâ€™s wood on the police station stove.  Not only had the visitor been unable to resist the mushrooms, but he had borrowed the salt from a neighbour when unable to find any.  He became a guest of HM for 21 days.
