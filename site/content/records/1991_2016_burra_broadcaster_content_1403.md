Daisy Kennedy Commemorative Concert

On Sunday 27 June the Carl Linger Ensemble will perform a concert commemorating one of Burra’s most famous daughters: Daisy Kennedy.

She was born at the Commercial Hotel in 1893 and later lived in Kangaroo Street while her father was Headmaster of Burra School [Joseph A. Kennedy 1893-95].  Daisy was a keen student and was permitted to begin classes at the age of four, when she also began playing the piano.  At seven she began violin lessons on a half-sized instrument.  At ten she was a gold medallist at the Adelaide University and this was followed by a three-year scholarship at Elder Conservatorium when she was thirteen.  In 1908 the renowned violinist Kubelik toured Australia and after much effort Daisy obtained an audience with him.  Kubelik was impressed and urged her, instead of studying, to go to Prague with a letter of introduction from him to the famous teacher Sevcik.  She did this and soon went to the Vienna Conservatorium, where Sevcik was to take up a position.  After two years she gained her diploma and with Sevcik went to London to play at the Queen’s Hall.  She moved to London to live in 1913 and played there under many famous conductors.  She made several trips to Australia with her first husband, pianist Benno Moiseiwitsch (Moiseivich) [1890-1963].  Later she visited with her second husband the poet John Drinkwater.  She also made tours of Europe, England and America.  Later she retired somewhat from public life, but played a great deal of chamber music and in 1938 after the death of her husband she took a position as leader and conductor of a male orchestra.*  She was tall, slender and attractive when young, was unspoiled by her success and ever gracious with a keen sense of humour.

The Carl Linger Ensemble was formed in 1985 and has a reputation for its varied repertoire, especially in the area of early Australian compositions.  It takes its name from Carl Linger (Berlin 1810-Adelaide 1862) who made a considerable contribution to early musical life in SA.

The concert will include a new work by Paul Paviour ‘A Distant Music’ composed to commemorate the centenary of Daisy Kennedy’s birth.

[*She married Benno Moiseiwitsch in April 1914 and they were divorced in 1924.  In December 1924 she married John Drinkwater, who died in 1937, leaving her in need of an income.]
