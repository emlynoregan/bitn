E.W. Crewes was almost killed at the Bon Accord crossing on Monday when he was so preoccupied by his thoughts that he failed to see the afternoon train until it blew its whistle at the last minute.  He managed to stop his dogcart only a yard from the crossing.  The railways refuse to put a man or a bell on the crossing.
