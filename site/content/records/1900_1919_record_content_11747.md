Storm.  There was a great storm on 18 October.  It was not so strong in the town, but still removed roofs from sheds and outhouses.  Gardens were damaged and fruit stripped from trees.  It was worse to the east where traffic on the Baldina Road was halted and one load of wool was blown over by the wind.  It also caused much damage towards Robertstown, Bright and Emu Downs where crops were badly damaged and in some places utterly destroyed.  The flat country around Hallett and Canowie was badly affected and shearing at Princess Royal was suspended due to the lightning.  Telegraph poles were bent double at Eudunda.  The only useful aspect was the rain which totalled 1.09” in Burra and 1.25” at World’s End.
