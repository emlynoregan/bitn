Weather.  Dust on Sunday plunged the town into gloom by 11.30 a.m. and unfortunately power is cut in the town till 4 p.m. on Sundays to allow for maintenance on the engines.  At 3 p.m. the sky was a seething cauldron of red, brown and black clouds and lights were needed.  The Electric Supply Co. had fortunately started early.  From 4 p.m. it rained mud and water from the roofs looked like tomato sauce.  About 30 points fell.  More rain followed on Monday and Tuesday to total about 87 points.  The dust was widespread in SA and rainfall in the east was lower with falls from 15 to 40 points generally.
