Burra’s Tourist Potential was assessed at a visit to Burra on Tuesday by the minister of Lands Hon. J.D. Corcoran and the Director of the SA Tourist Bureau Mr P. Pollnitz.  They were responding to an invitation from the Mayor E.T. Baulderstone and his Council.  They were accompanied by Mr P.H. Quirke MP and had a tour of the town with the Mayor and Town Clerk, local historian, Mr I.L. Auhl and the Revs G.D. Sibly & M. Lind.  They visited the old Brewery Cellars, the Lock-up and Stables at Burra North, the Redruth Gaol, Bon Accord Waterworks, Miners’ Dugouts, the Mine and Aboriginal carvings in Stone Chimney Creek, etc.

They felt tourist interest in Burra had grown considerably in the past two years as a result of efforts by the National Trust and the Town Council.  Mr Pollnitz believes Burra has more tourist potential than any other SA town.  The party was conducted over the Museum by Mr S.J. Woollacott.  As a result of the visit the Tourist Bureau and Government have a better knowledge of the extent of the tourist area and any case for preservation will be given good priority.  As no Government money is available to the National Trust, the best approach will be through the Town Council.
