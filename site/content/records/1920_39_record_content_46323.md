Frank Treloar: Looking Back (Continued)

On 8 September 1845 Mr Stock was appointed Chairman.  A memo of agreement was entered into on 16 August 1845 between G.F. Aston & C.H. Bagot on one part and William Allen and Samuel Stocks Jnr on the other concerning an application for a Special Survey of 20,000 acres, each side to pay Â£10,000.  Permission was to be obtained to divide the survey into equal portions of 10,000 acres each by a straight line transversely through the centre east-west: the survey to embrace the district of mineral formation recently examined by Mr Finke and party.  The Governor to grant separate land grants to each portion . . . The portion for each party to be decided by lot. . .  Each party agreed to equal share of costs so far incurred by Mr Finke, by remuneration to Thomas Picket and by the partial survey of Mr Jacob etc.  All further connection between the parties to cease on the issue of the land grants.  The application for a special survey was granted.  The Governor decided the form of the block had to be that of a rectangular parallelogram.

Directors met on 9 September 1845.  Mr Kingston produced a tracing of the country explaining that the block had been arranged so that the north and south lodes were both included, being about 12 chains from north and south boundaries respectively.  He was not prepared to say which was the more valuable, as he believed no one could do so.

The Board of Directors met on 16 September 1845.  Present were: Stocks, Bunce, Peacock, Paxton, Graham, Penny, Solomon and Neales.  A letter was received that the Surveyor General was ready to issue the land grants, also a letter concerning a survey of a further 640 acres in the neighbourhood of the south lode.  Mr Stocks reported on the drawing of the lot and the northern portion had fallen to SAMA and consequently they wrote to the Surveyor General asking that the northern half be made out in the names of William Allen & Samuel Stocks Jnr and the southern half in the names of Charles Harvey Bagot and George Frederick Aston.
