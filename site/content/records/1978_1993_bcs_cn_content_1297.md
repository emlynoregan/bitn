Hallett Primary School is to be rebuilt and renovated.  It is hoped construction will begin early in 1980.  The existing portable building will be replaced with a modern solid construction teaching area for three teachers, joined to the two existing stone building.  The old section will be upgraded with the two existing classrooms becoming a resource centre and the rest of the building will be used for office, storage and staffroom facilities.  Some upgrading of the grounds is likely to be included.
