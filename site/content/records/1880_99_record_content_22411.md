Burra Town Council.

The stationmen in the Chapel St Reserve and Welsh Place are to grow forest trees for transplanting around the town.

Burra Creek Weir.  No reply yet from the Government about the proposed weir in the Burra Creek.

Rate defaulters.  ‘Town Clerk said he had not proceeded against defaulting ratepayers as instructed because there were four members of the Council who had not paid their rates.’  The order to be obeyed.

Aberdeen Reserve.  A title has now been issued for the Aberdeen Reserve.  Messrs McLaren, White & Co. offered it to the Council for £224.  Consideration deferred.

The unemployed men working on the Mongolata Dam would finish this week.  Cr Coglin thought the Government might be asked to have them clean out Barker’s Dam.  Resolved to put it to them.
