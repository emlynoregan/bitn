Burra Retail Traders’ Association responds to ‘Irate School Leaver’. 

One reason for employing married women is given in Irate’s own letter: she wants experience before going on to Adelaide.  It costs money to train employees, who frequently leave before they are of value to an employer.  Most local businessmen who employ a percentage of married women do so where a senior is needed to train juniors, or to ensure continuity of employment, or where the married woman joined their staff whilst single.  Many local people do not support local business and this does not allow them to grow and employ more staff.  The town and district is only as strong as the support it gets.  Burra is on the threshold of a great future due to tourism and mining.  Unfortunately there are a few in the district who cannot see the advantages of tourism to the whole district, namely that it brings in many people who demand better shops, cafés, hotels, roads, parks and sporting facilities etc. that are also then enjoyed by locals.  It creates more jobs for more people and has a snowballing effect.  The businessmen of Burra sympathise with school leavers who desire employment here, but hope they will not become ‘knockers’ of the town and district.
