E.W. Dunhill of Redruth, at 76, celebrates 50 years as a Local Preacher on Sunday 16 September.  [The next week’s paper got this right by reporting it as 60 years.]  He will be acknowledged with a service of recognition and a presentation.  In the early years he rode a bicycle 40 miles to conduct three services on Sunday and occasionally up to 60 miles.  He has been Superintendent of the Redruth Sunday School and caretaker of the Redruth Church properties, while still finding time to wield the smithy’s hammer.  Over the course of years the Congregational and Baptist Churches have also benefited from his services.
