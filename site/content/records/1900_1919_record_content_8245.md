Mr Jeffrey of The Lagoon had an accident last week on the way from his home to Schomburgk, when he was apparently thrown out and stunned.  The horse was taken out of the trap, the harness placed in the vehicle and Mr Jeffrey turned up on Wednesday at Mr Kiekebuscheâ€™s, having wandered around dazed all night.  The horse found its own way home.  Mr Jeffrey (c. 65) sustained a severe gash to his jaw, a damaged wrist and thumb and also bruises.  Mr Rooke brought him in to the Hospital.

[In two places the wrist is said to be dislocated and in one place it is broken.  The Hd of Schomburgk was renamed Hd of Maude in 1918.  The mystery of the release of the horse and the placement of the harness is solved in the next issue.]
