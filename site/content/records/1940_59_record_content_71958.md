Burra Primary School Welfare Club held its AGM and elected: President, Mrs Baulderstone; Vice-Presidents, Mrs D. Field & Mrs Bob Radford; Treasurer, Mrs Wickes & Secretary, Mrs C. Phillips.  The club had a membership of 33 and put into the school almost Â£200 worth of equipment in 1955.  The children were given a picnic at Gum Creek.  The remainder of the playground equipment was installed.  We hoped to have made a start on the lunch room by now, but our plans were rejected by the Education Department and we are waiting for an amended scheme.  The school ball was a happy and successful event.  We bought this year a new sewing machine, a sand tray, globes, library books, free work materials, door scrapers, footballs, skipping ropes and a typewriter for staff use.
