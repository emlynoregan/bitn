Hanson Methodist Church

Rev. W.F. James opened the porch of the Hanson church on 27 March and then preached his farewell sermon.  The congregations over Easter were large with over 100 going from Burra to the tea meeting on Good Friday, to bring the total to c. 300.  The new fence was also much admired.  The total cost of the church, porch etc. has now reached £315-16-0 and up to the 23 March £294-4-1 has been received.  Subscriptions, tea-money, and collections have since raised £23-11-5, leaving £1-19-6 in hand.  Rev. W.F. James was presented with a Morocco bound address with two photographs of the church and its office bearers.
