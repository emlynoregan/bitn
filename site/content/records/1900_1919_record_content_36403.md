Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting: Questions.

W.J. Richards asked if Councillors favoured putting manure from the roads on the racecourse instead of using it for blinding.

Mr Crewes thought townsfolk’s health would benefit from doing so.

‘When metal was recently blinded in Market Square, Mr George Lord had expressed his intention of growing cabbages in the street.’

The Mayor said using earth from the side of the road for blinding had always been done and using another source would cost money.

Mr Lott blames motorcars for the road problems.

There was a question regarding the legality of a Municipal Court.

Mr Milner asked if Councillors were in favour of erecting a town clock.

Cr Wicklein said yes, amid laughter.  [He was a clockmaker.]

Messrs Wicklein, Crewes, Moore & Lane would favour a town clock if a generous benefactor would donate one.  [The cost according to Cr Wicklein would be about £100.]

Mr Radford could not even support that proposition while ‘Aberdeen had not even a post office.’

[This led to an exchange about whether Aberdeen was asleep or awake and exposed the usual rift in the town.]

Mr Geake wanted to know if candidates were in favour of widening and straightening the bridge in Ayers St.

Mr Crewes favoured a new Bridge.
