Solomon Williams of Glenelg: Reminiscences of Burra in the 1850s.

Among the attractions of Whit-Monday Holiday was occasionally the roasting of a whole bullock, which I saw on two occasions.  It took place on level ground just beyond the Burra Hotel. Complete with head and horns it was chained to a spit.  Skewers about half an inch thick passed through the sides and through the spit and all was then placed on two forked posts and a cranked handle fitted.  The wood was laid and the flames melted the fat.  It was never properly roasted in this crude way.  Wind deflected the flames and the heat and after hours of treatment no proper use could be made of it.  On one such occasion a number of Aborigines were present and took away great quantities of half-raw beef to their nearby camp.

Games on the occasions included jingling in the ring, bobbing for apple and treacled buns, a greasy pole to climb and a greasy-tailed pig to be caught.  The latter ran between the people in the crowd creating great mirth, excitement and screams before it escaped to open ground pursued by a trail of men and boys.  Foot races were run for the boys; and Williams tells how he unexpectedly beat Chris Moody in one because the latter’s braces broke in the dash for the line.  Chris later became a hotel valuer, agent and auctioneer.  Cornish wrestling was promoted at Christmas time and was held in the stable yards of the Miners’ Arms Hotel with plenty of sawdust and manure.  This was not like the modern game with its hate and venom and intent to maim the opponent.  Opponents took a ‘hitch’ on each other and struggled till there was a fall, when they got to their feet and took a fresh ‘hitch’, unless it was a fair backfall, which settled the match.  It depended on strength and feet and leg dexterity.  Umpires called ‘sticklers’ judged the falls and were kept moving by cries from the onlookers whose views they blocked.  Ginger beer was provided free by the lessee of the hotel to lubricate the throats of the contestants.  Combatants took off coats and waistcoats and put on wrestling jackets specially made of strong canvas with strings in place of buttons.  Contests went two or three days in the holiday season.

The pound yards were unusual.  They were erected by the mining company and were large and strong, of heavy timber.  As well as holding straying or trespassing cattle and horses they were used as a market place for fat cattle brought in for slaughtering.  Some came from NSW and were wild animals.

Williams then tells a couple of tales about wild cattle and horses.  After a large mob of horses were sold some miners acquired them and took to kangaroo hunts, but the craze soon died when fodder prices had to be met.  Dr Mayne bought a good looking horse from this mob and called him ‘Bauek-a-ballagh’ which we were told was Irish for ‘Clear the Course’, but he failed to live up to racing hopes.
