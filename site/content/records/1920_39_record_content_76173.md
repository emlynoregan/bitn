LCL Rally, Social & Dance ended a busy day for the Premier on Friday.  Mr Playford and Mr J.G. Duncan-Hughes were the speakers.  The speeches are reported.  Mr Duncan-Hughes spoke of the impending conflict and the Labor Partyâ€™s statement that no Australians should be sent overseas in the event of war.  Such a policy could be disastrous and would leave Australia defenceless without allies if the Empire and her allied were defeated in Europe and Australia would have to fight on alone or grovel before the victors.
