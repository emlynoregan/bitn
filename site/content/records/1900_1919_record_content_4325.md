Cricket.  Burra Cricket Club met on Tuesday 8 October.  The Town Council has agreed to pay £5 towards the new cricket pitch, but will retain ⅔ of the gate money until repaid.  This offer was accepted.  A match v. Gum Creek Station hands to be played at Gum Creek on 19 October.  A match with Manoora will be arranged for 2 November if possible.  Weather prevented the Gum Creek match last Saturday.
