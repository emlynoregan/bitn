Government policy was against issuing a building permit when facilities for which the building was to be used were already in existence.  High priority would be given to additions and renovations.

Eventually a scheme was evolved by which the Burra Hospital Isolation Block would be enlarged to accommodate all the nursing staff and the old portion of the Hospital would be either renovated or demolished.  The Board will now confer with an architect.
