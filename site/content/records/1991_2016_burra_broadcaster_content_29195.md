Adchem’s Copper carbonate Plant has been opened.  Part of their plant has been refitted with the addition of three additional process vessels to increase the potential production of copper carbonate to more than 3,000 tonnes p.a.  Total investment in the new plant is more than $1.8 million and it will employ a further eight people, including two apprentices.  Michael Hillman starts soon as an apprentice electrician and Ben Jones as an apprentice boilermaker.  This brings Adchem staff to 43, up from the 30 of a couple of years ago.  Adchem operates the largest single plant producing copper oxide in the world.  Copper carbonate is an industrial form of malachite, making an unusual link with the original Burra mining operation.  Copper oxide is mainly used in the timber preservation industry in the copper chrome arsenate (CCA) preservative.  It is exported to more than 20 countries and Adchem expects ultimately to send copper carbonate to most of them too.  About one in four treated posts in the world contains copper oxide from Adchem’s Burra operation.   [Photo.]
