Redruth Reformatory.  On Sunday it was reported that Agnes Dyke (sister to the notorious Dyke who is serving a long sentence in Adelaide Gaol) and Bertha Learmouth had escaped.  An immediate search failed to locate them.  This is the third time they have escaped and points to the need for greater surveillance.  How they escaped is a mystery, as all doors and windows remained locked and it cannot be seen where or how they scaled the wall.  On the last escape two or three months ago they had a bad a time of it and were finally found at Tothill’s Creek.
