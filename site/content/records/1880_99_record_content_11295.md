The Mayor’s Report for 1883.

The year began with a debit of £2-3-4 and South Ward was heavily in debt to Middle Ward.  After deducting debts North Ward had £295, Middle Ward £395 and South Ward £68.  The money in hand for the town survey was later made available for works by ratepayer permission which increased ward totals to: North £425, Middle £525, South £198.  At present the balance was: North £13, Middle £22, South debit £1-8-11.  He anticipated the new Council would start the year 1884 with a clean sheet apart from the bonded debt, of which £100 will fall due in 1884.

During the year various waterworks proposals were considered.  Ultimately the scheme decided on was the proposal of the Government to construct a waterworks and a system of mains etc. and to hand the scheme over to the Council with the latter to pay 3% on capital costs in the 1st year, 4% in the 2nd year and 5% per annum thereafter.  The Council would control the scheme and retain any profits over this annual rental and running costs.  A number of people have guaranteed to take a specified amount of water.  It is believed water could be temporarily laid on from the present works pending completion of the new reservoir.
