Cr Kellaway favoured instead a conference between the RSA and Council.

Cr Riggs favoured, if the motion to move the guns were rescinded, a special rate in 1927 to enclose the guns and mount them decently.

After exhaustive discussion to little purpose the motion was put and lost, which meant a similar motion cannot be put for 12 months.

It was resolved to meet with the RSA.

It was also resolved not to ask the trustees of the guns to attend that meeting.
