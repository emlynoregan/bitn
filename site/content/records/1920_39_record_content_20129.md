Burra Institute Committee has decided to make extensive alterations and improvements, which will entail a bigger outlay that originally expected.  Only four of 326 subscribers came to the meeting called by the committee to approve this decision and the borrowing of Â£1,600.  This was passed unanimously.  It was also decided to cover the Council Chamber with linoleum, a long-left want.
