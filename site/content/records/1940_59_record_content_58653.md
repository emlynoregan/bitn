Burra Burra DC, 8 April

The DC invited the Town Council to join their Council in the Coronation Celebrations planned for 2 June.

DC. Hallett is concerned about the prevalence of Dyer Weed in Booborowie area.

Rabbit warrens have been ripped up on the King Stock Road from Morgan boundary for 20 miles and some also on World’s End Stock Road.

Mt Bryan East road has been improved and the new road on the east side of the railway line to Mt Bryan Station has been formed and metalled and RC pipes installed to make it an all-weather road.

Main Road 45 through Mt Bryan Township was bituminised early in the month.
