Burra National Trust and the SA State Director have approached Goyder Council explaining their financial position and seeking help if they are to continue to lease the Burra Visitor Centre (BVC).  When the Trust took over the centre five years ago it had a bank balance of $65,000.  This has dwindled and reached a point where if it continues for another year could be in the red.  The National Trust would prefer a partnership with the Council rather than the option of not renewing the lease.

Maureen Wright said that in the last four years they have made a minimum annual loss of $10,000 managing the passport and Council owned sites and twice losses have exceeded $30,000.  The Trust is seeking $60,000 p.a. to operate the BVC and manage the Council properties.  This is about $40,000 more than the current support.  The Trust has established a business around the current turnover of $185,000.  This involves employing at least 20 casual staff and one full time, with a wage bill of $111,000.  Volunteers assist to a total of at least 40 hours per week.  The Council has referred the matter to a committee for investigation and a report.

Farrell Flat Centenary of Federation Celebrations took place on Sunday last.  The main street has been transformed by the erection of a shelter containing panels depicting the town’s history and a mural depicting local historical links.  The nature strip of the divided road has become a flower garden with landscaping and Goyder Council has kerbed the island and undertaken roadworks.  Graham Harvey as Chairman of the Farrell Flat Community Management Committee was master of ceremonies at the official opening.  Speakers were:

Council CEO Stephen Kerrigan

John Hannaford of the SA Centenary of Federation Committee

Graham Gunn MP

Council Chairman, Dennis Keller

Other participants in the formalities included Ian Denton, Clyde Atkins and Laurel Neill.

Marilyn Kuchel of Australia’s Open Gardens Scheme opened the garden section.

The mural was the work of artists Marcus Possingham and Roland Weight.
