Obituary.  The Hon. John Bentham Neales.

For some time it has been known that the health of this old colonist has been far from robust.  Towards the end of the last session of Parliament he had to absent himself from the Legislative Council with sick leave.  Although he had since then partially recovered, the unfavourable symptoms returned and on Thursday they terminated fatally.  Since his arrival in 18828 his name has been honourably linked with the commerce and politics of this province.  Upon arrival he and another gentleman commenced trading as general merchants.  Towards the close of the year he succeeded Mr R. Cock as auctioneer, and shortly afterwards he was appointed by the Government to act in that capacity.  His geniality, quaint wit and shrewd business knowledge peculiarly adapted him for the pursuit of public salesman and he attained great success and popularity in it.  In 1840 he and several other influential persons formed the Adelaide Auction Co. and for many years he wielded the hammer for them.  He early displayed an interest in the mineral interests of the colony and it is with these that he has been most thoroughly and heartily identified.  More than anyone else he merits the title of Father of Mining in SA.  He has spent large sums of money testing localities where metals were supposed to be buried and always directed his influence and advocacy to the advancement of bona fide mining.  He was the first to start the search for gold in the vicinity of Montacute and was an original shareholder in the famed Burra Burra Mine.  It would be impossible here to list the scores of other mining ventures he has supported.  In 1849 he was a keen supported of the proposal to build a railway to Port Adelaide and was appointed to that undertaking’s committee.  From its commencement he was a leading proprietor in the Port Land Company.  Up to 1842 he was generally known as Mr Neales Bentham to prevent confusion with another person in the colony then engaged in mercantile pursuits.  Since then he has been known by his proper name.  In 1846 he was among speakers at a public meeting protesting the importation of juvenile offenders known as Parkhurst Boys, from their having been confined in the Reformatory of that name.  The indignant protests of the colonists prevailed and home authorities withdrew the proposal.  In 1851 he was speaking at large protests against transportation to the Australian colonies.  Shortly before this he had been appointed to the Board of City Commissioners, which office he retained until the election of the first City Council under the Act of 1849.  His standing in the community was demonstrated when he was returned as a member of the first Legislative Council as the Member for North Adelaide, defeating Mr P. Cumming.  In 1855 he was returned for the same constituency, defeating Mr Alexander Hay.  In this period he introduced and managed to get passed, a measure for the registration of Joint-Stock Companies and for limiting their liability.  His sympathies were always on the side of liberality and progress.  His vote assisted in passing many of the reforms, which from time to time have been made in the colony.  In 1852 he was a member of the Select Committee to investigate amending the constitution.  Three years later he sat on a committee charged with examining plans and specifications for assuring Adelaide had a permanent water supply and an efficient system of drainage.  He was also for several years on the Board of the Botanic Garden.  The respect in which he was held saw his return in 1857 to the first SA Parliament under the new Constitution Act.  He was one of six members chosen to represent the city in the House of Assembly.  Two years later when F.S. Dutton resigned he joined the Ministry as Commissioner of crown Lands, but held the office only briefly, retiring from Parliament at the next election.  In 1862 he re-entered the House of Assembly as a member for Burra.  In conjunction with Mr Cole he represented that district in two Parliaments.  In a third his partner was Mr Boucaut.  In 1865 he succeeded in getting passed a bill empowering the formation of Companies and Associations of miners with limited liability.  From November 1865 to March 1866 he was Commissioner of Crown Lands in Captain Hart’s Government.  In 1870 he was defeated at the election, but two months later was elected unopposed to as eat in the Legislative Council.  His genial disposition and companionable character secured for himself a large circle of friends.  His business capabilities raised him to a high rank in commercial circles.  In politics he was less ambitious than some, but a diligent legislator.  As a speaker he was fluent and always entertaining.  His style was epigrammatic and his speeches, even on the driest of subjects were full of natural humour and abounded in anecdotes.  His death will be extensively regretted.  He is survived by a widow, two sons and three daughters.  Of the latter, one is married to Rev. Thomas Field M.A. and another to Mr J.L. Field.

[John Bentham Neales died 31 July 1873, Glenelg aged 67.]
