Utica Mining Co.

Annual Meeting of shareholders was held on 8 March.  A.L. Walker presided.  G. Sampson was elected a director to replace J.M. McDonald who retired.

The engine and pump have been disposed of to Horwood & Co. of Adelaide for £110.  Proceeds will have to go to the Government.  No mining has been done since the last meeting, but with copper at £108-£110 per ton this meeting will have to decide on the desirability of recommencing developmental work.  The ore on the surface should certainly be sent for treatment and it may be advisable to see if it can be augmented from work at 100’.  We are in credit £100.  If we decide not to go on then all property of the company should be removed from the mine and placed in the care of the secretary.
