Public Works

The road at Bewley’s is nearly completed.

A lamp should be placed on Henderson’s Bridge.

Having interviewed Mr Lewis the committee recommended that Bagot, Shakes & Lewis be allowed to divert the water down the street on the northern side of the brewery wall and on the north side of that street, that the channel be six feet wide and of sufficient depth to carry off the water and be pitch-paved every half chain for 8 ft long and 6 ft broad and at the end for 20 ft by 8 ft.  The offer to be put in writing and the work to be completed in one month.

Various minor works were approved.
