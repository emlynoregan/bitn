Burra Town Council Elections

Stanley Kellaway has been elected Mayor, unopposed.

The retiring Mayor T.H. Woollacott had held the position for a record period of 6½ years continuously.  Mr M. Collins held it for six years and Mr Crewes for ten, but over three periods.

Mr Woollacott held office through the difficult period of the depression and inaugurated the Unemployment Relief Committee.  He represented the town at many official visits by Vice-Regal representatives and other distinguished persons.  Mrs Woollacott in her period as Mayoress has also fulfilled her duties in a most creditable manner.

The cartoon of Mr Woollacott by Pearce is reprinted.

Mr S. Kellaway has been a Councillor for 16 years and has been a careful observer of his Ward’s welfare and always careful of East Ward’s finances.

Mr Robert J. McWaters was elected unopposed for North Ward.

For West Ward Cornelius W. Samuel & Cr Graham H. Dow have nominated.
