Local Court, Redruth, 2 September, before Mr A. Motley.

John Burgess was fined 5/- for being drunk.

Patrick Sullivan, William Wall and A. Crawford were each fined 10/- for fighting at Aberdeen on Saturday evening.

George May Smith was fined 30/- for being drunk and riotous when in the station and in default, was sent to Gaol for 14 days.

Fritz Martin, an old offender, was fined 20/- for being drunk.

Edward Evans and David Williams were charged with feloniously assaulting Andrew Crawford at the Smelting Works.  On Monday morning Crawford went into the little engine room (which appears to be a sort of drinking room), where the defendants were with many others.  A bottled of gin was discussed and the complainant has a drink with the rest.  When David Evans came in the gin was gone, supposed to be hidden.  This caused some words.  Crawford was suddenly caught by the hair and knocked down, when the whole company kicked at him.  Eventually he got up and a man opened the door and let him out.  He challenged any man singly, but did not mean to be murdered, first by one and then by another.  David Williams threw a bottle at him and the whole party took to throwing slag, bricks and stones at him, to such an extent as to break the lights of the carpenters shop nearby.

W. Birt, G. Oliver and Mr Skewes corroborated the evidence in most material points and the defendants were committed for trial at the Court of Full Jurisdiction.  Bail was afterwards taken for their appearance.
