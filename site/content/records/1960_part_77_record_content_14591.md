Obituary.  Harold Vivian Lord was the eldest son of the late Mr & Mrs J.V. Lord and was born at Burra in 1888.  He spent his early life at the Barrier in the early days of prospecting and mining at Thackaringa, Silverton, Daydream, Broken Hill and Pinnacles.  He lived on Silverdale, a pastoral property owned by his father, which was later incorporated into ‘Thackaringa’ Station, a family holding still occupied by his nephews.  He was educated at Prince Alfred College and the SA School of Mines in wool-classing.  After a short while at his father’s southern home at Sandergrove, he took over management of Pine Valley Station east of Burra and actively ran this property for forty years and at his death was the owner within the interests of J.V. Lord & Sons.  He introduced deep boring to the east country, sinking Cockatoo Bore to 680 ft.  As partner in J.V. Lord & Sons he had an interest too in Kalkaroo, Oakvale, Lord’s Well and Balah and was consultant for his sister’s property Eureka NSW and a director of the family’s pastoral companies at Yardea in the northwest and Tresant in the South East of SA.

[Died 1 December 1962 Unley Park.  The birth does not appear on SA Births CD.]
