Burra Heritage Plaques.  The program was begun in 2011 and now there are 43 plaques on buildings or sites of interest in the town and a further 22 are spread through the Council Region.  This has been accomplished through support from Goyder Council Ward Funds.  If you would like a plaque for your premises, contact The Burra History Group.  Plaques are free, but there is an installation cost of c. $25 if not installed by the owner.

[Examples of three plaques, with photos are printed.]
