New Tourist Signs have been erected between Burra & Burra North [opposite the Mine entrance] in an effort to acquaint visitors with the full range of sites and services at either end of the town.  This promises to be the start of a general overhaul of signage in the town and region.  It follows discussions between the Council and BRTBA and the Tourism Working Party.  The signs are financed by Council.
