Burra Town Council, 7 September

A.B. Riggs advises that the Institute Committee would be delighted to meet Council delegates about the purchase of the Institute on 14 September at 8.15 p.m.

H.J.B. Jennison sought the donation of two trees to be dedicated to fallen past scholars of the school on Arbor Day.  Council agreed to the request.

Messrs Austin & Co. Smallgoods Manufacturers in Burra might have to close down because the Government did not have any inspectors available to examine pig carcases prior to their consignment to the city.  This would see families leave the town and more empty shops in the street.

A letter of protest will be sent to the Premier – the carcases had to pass through a State Inspector and then a Commonwealth Inspector.

Watertable to be cleaned in front of Mr R. Fuss’s and 30 ft of cement kerbing to be constructed.

(Mr Fuss having offered to pay one third of the cost.)

Rumours that flour and soap are to be rationed are without foundation.
