Burra Racing Club held its first meeting for seven years at the Aberdeen Racecourse on Thursday 1 October.  The course is deemed one of the best outside the metropolitan area and is well furnished with all necessary conveniences.  The gate takings were £70 and the track was well grassed.  Licensed bookmakers were on the ground for the first time and as a consequence the totalizator did not do much business.  The main race was the Centenary Handicap over 1 mile and 2 furlongs.  First prize £50, 2nd £10 and 3rd £5.  Mr O’Loughlin’s Drim ridden by Carling crossed the line 1¼ lengths ahead of P. Driscoll’s Bachelor Green ridden by Medhurst.  But at the weigh-in Carling was found to be 7 lb short and the race was awarded to Bachelor Green.  [Results of other races are printed.]
