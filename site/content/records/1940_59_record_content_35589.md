Fire.  The season’s biggest grass fire broke out last Tuesday near the railway line in the vicinity of C.P. Turner’s property, immediately after the Adelaide-Burra midday train had passed.  When the alarm was raised people came from as far away as Manoora and Clare.  A strong north wind was blowing, causing the fire to advance at an amazing rate.  Soon 300 men were fighting the blaze.  They saved Mrs G. Webster’s home, though she lost all her implement sheds, seed wheat and super.  They saved Old Koonoona Homestead.  As it gathered strength the fire crossed a disused road into the property of G. Finch and swept in a north-westerly direction* through the properties of Mr J. Lockett, Mrs G. Webster, Mr K.R. Crewes and then into Koonoona.  Another front from the same source swept into the property of Messrs W. & J. Mitchell and thence into Koonoona.  On the way it laid waste thousands of acres of grassland and stubble as well as burning fences and haystacks.

It was impossible to stop the fire by beating it or with water and so a firebreak was burnt in the southeast corner of Koonoona, where the property abuts the Adelaide road, on the turn opposite ‘The Gap’ station.  This break was about three miles in length and with the help of this break and the Adelaide road the fire was eventually controlled.  The losses will run into many thousands of pounds.  Losses:

Mr C.P. Turner – 40 acres of feed and 8 miles of fencing.

Mr Glen Finch – 85 acres of grass and stubble and 1 mile of fencing.

Mrs G. Webster– 4 miles of fencing, 380 acres of stubble and grassland, a haystack, 140 bags of seed wheat, 3½ tons of super, an implement shed with plant and equipment, one dog and one calf.

Mr J. Lockett – 170 acres of grass and stubble and 1½ miles of fencing.

Mr K.R. Crewes – 350 acres of grass and stubble, 5 miles of fencing and a timbered well.

Messrs W. & J. Mitchell – 40 acres of stubble and 2 miles of fencing.

Koonoona Proprietors – many thousands of acres of grassland, haystacks, 200 tons of baled hay.  Stock losses have not yet been ascertained, but must include some hundreds of sheep and probably some valuable stud rams.

[*If there was a strong northerly wind, the fire can hardly have travelled northwest and the description that follows would seem to suggest it was sweeping south-easterly.]
