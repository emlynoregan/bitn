Local Board of Health.

An account for £12 arrived from the Burra Hospital for three patients admitted with an infectious disease.

Burra District Council considers that appointing the Town Inspector an Inspector under the DC would not solve the problem of meat slaughtered outside the town.

Five cases of enteric (typhoid) fever were reported in the last fortnight.

The Mayor referred to scarcity in the water supply.

Cr Radford said if the engine can’t fill the tanks what was the point of making the extra reservoir?  The hydraulic engineer is to be asked for an explanation of the shortage.
