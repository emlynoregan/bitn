Aberdeen Football Club was re-formed last year after being in recess for a number of years.  An application to join the North Eastern League was rejected, but the club was accepted into the Mid North Association.  The club compared favourably with other teams in that Association.  Aberdeenâ€™s Captain-Coach, Kevin Lane, was elected Captain of the Association team.  The team got as far as the preliminary final, which was very satisfactory for a first year team.  The club now has a very substantial club house erected and a hot shower room is nearing completion and should be ready for the first home match on 5 May.  The Captain topped the Association goal-kicking list and won the Mail Medal.  This year Kevin Lane is again Captain-Coach with Don Lloyd as Vice-Captain.  Darrel Kakoschke is Captain of the Colts.  A scratch match against Farrell Flat was played last Sunday at Farrell Flat.
