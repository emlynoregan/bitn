The Proposed Stony Gap Wind Farm located c. 125 km north of Adelaide and 5 km from Burra has obtained approval from the SA Environment Resources & Development Court.  Energy Australia had submitted the development application in 2001 and now needed to re-assess the project based on current market conditions.  The proposal was to put 35 turbines on 85 m high towers on two parallel ridges of the Tothills Ranges.  [Map]
