Burra Town Council, 19 September.

The Mayor reported that the Midland Road Board was not inclined to erect a bridge at the Bon Accord, but would build a ford.  They would do this and lengthen the culvert near the station for c. £350.

A. Schutz applied for a cab licence, which was granted.

Cr Ridgway moved that the Government be required to make good the road past the railway yard.  He said Government officials had changed their story several times on the issue.  The Government had taken the original road on which the railway yard was now situated and the present fence was wrongly aligned.  There was no Council when it was done or widths of roads and alignments would have been attended to.  The Government should keep its own laws. The Government had opened a lane along the highway to give an approach to Mr Butterworth’s Mill.  It was in a state of disrepair and should have been put in repair before the Council took over.

Cr West 2nd, though he could not endorse all that was said.

Cr Sampson thought that they were unlikely to be able to force the issue without a survey of the town to prove the bad alignment and as tenders for that had been £800-£1,000, it was not going to happen.  The motion was passed.

Cr Tiver thought Cr Sampson was wasting money altering the approach to the bridge by Henderson’s  [The Kingston St bridge] and work elsewhere was more urgent.  He had not been consulted, although he was on the Public Works Committee.

Cr Coglin said nothing discourteous had been intended and Cr Sampson had been under the impression that it was the general view that the work was desirable.

An altercation then ensued between Crs Tiver and Sampson, which the Mayor had to halt.

Cr Sampson moved notice be given to Mr Mayger not to continue to occupy any portion of road or footway in Market Square.

Cr Tiver thought that auctioneers [Cr Sampson was an auctioneer] should be dealt with the same way.

It was resolved the Inspector would proceed against all persons obstructing streets or footways.
