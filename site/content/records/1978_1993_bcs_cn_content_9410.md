BCS is considering the purchase of eight micro-computers to set up a Computing Studies Room for use by all students.  It is considering buying an Amigo computer â€“ similar to Apple II series, but half the cost.  It can run all Apple II software.  (Apple II has the largest range of educational software up to 64 K.)
