The 2012 World Day of Copper saw a successful three-day conference at Burra.

Much of the discussion focused on the rise of Swansea as a smelting centre in the nineteenth century, (known as the Swansea moment) which led to the globalisation of copper mining.  Several guest presenters and experts delivered papers at the Burra Town Hall, including:

Peter Bell of Flinders University: The early development of copper smelting in Australia.

Chris Evans of the University of Glamorgan: African slaves and Chinese indentured labourers in the services of Swansea Copper.

Luis Ortega of the University of Santiago, Chile: Copper mining and labour during the industryâ€™s golden age and its downfall, 1840-85.

David Bannear of Heritage Victoria: The Burra Smelting Works.

Katherine Morrisey of the University of Arizona: The environmental impacts of the Swansea moment.

Bill Jones of the University of Cardiff: Cross-cultural encounters; Welsh copper workers in Chile during the Swansea moment.

Members of the public were invited to attend.

Greg Drew senior geologist and author of Discovering Historic Burra led a tour of the Kapunda Mine before the party arrived in Burra.  He also gave a presentation on Leyshon Jones, father and son, Welsh smeltermen who dominated the SA smelting scene 1848-55.

The Burra workshop included tours of the Burra Mine, the Mine Store, the Smelting Works and dugouts, while the post conference tour took in Kadina.

The World of Copper Project began in 2011 with delegates converging on Swansea and the next workshop will be in Santiago Chile in 2013.  [5 photos.]
