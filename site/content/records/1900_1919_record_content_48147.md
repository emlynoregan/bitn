The Jubilee of Rechabitism in Burra was celebrated in the Cheer-up Rooms Tuesday of last week with c. 130 present.  The 1st meeting 50 years ago was held in the old Baptist Chapel, now the Council Depot.  Only two of the foundation members survive: Rev. J.A. Burns & Thomas Parks, both in failing health.  The 1st secretary was the late David Wells, followed by David Anderson.  C.J. Pearce has been secretary for the last 40 years.  Membership is now 149.  The strong female tent has 170 members and there is also a juvenile tent.  The tent was financially strong.
