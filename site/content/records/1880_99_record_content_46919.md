Redruth Correspondent:

Shearers are in town and increasing the business activity.

Part of the iron for the Bon Accord Bridge has arrived at the Railway Station: erection will begin at once.

The ballast quarry is being cleaned out in preparation for the laying of the siding from the station.  The Town Council will be asked to allow crossings over two roads in their control.

H. Roach, C. Fuss & W. Neville are talked of as possible North Ward candidates for Council.

Cr Rabbich is being approached to stand for Mayor.
