Obituary.  Mr T. Jeffery who died on 29 April lived for many years in the Booborowie District.  He was the fifth son of the late Mr Jeffery of Anlaby and was born there in 1873.  He lived for several years at South Booborowie before being allocated a block of the north Booborowie Estate.  After a long stay there he disposed of it to buy a large farm at Cappadola where he resided until his death.  He was a much respected hard-working, honest man who called a spade a spade.  He married Louisa Affolter, eldest daughter of Mrs A. & the late Mr J. Affolter of Booborowie in 1903.  The widow survives with 12 children: Mrs C. Keys (Hallett), the Misses Louie, Nellie, Lorrie, Blanche, Joan, Patricia, Edna and Norman, Edward, Max & Morris.
