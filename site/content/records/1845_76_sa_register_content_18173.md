Election Meeting

About 80 electors assembled at the Aberdeen Hotel in Redruth [actually in Aberdeen] on Wednesday 8 February to hear candidates for election explain their views.  Mr O. Harvey presided.

Mr G.W. Cole:

On the question of the squatters’ runs he would uphold Goyder’s valuations.

On roads he thought the north had been shamefully neglected and he would endeavour to get a large share of the £250,000 that it was proposed to borrow for roadwork directed to northern roads.

On immigration he understood there was a need for agricultural labourers, but he was opposed to any further importation of miners.

J.B. Neales:

He thought it was a mistake to be holding a meeting at Aberdeen, so close to where a meeting had been held the previous night.  He had explained his views there and was not in the habit of changing them the next day.

He strongly supported much greater expenditure on northern roads.

He would not like to see immigration completely stopped, but it needed to suit the needs of the colony.  He thought that assisted immigration was better than immigration completely funded by the colony, as it attracted a better class of migrant.

He was not in favour of any direct taxation or poll tax, though he did support an income tax on absentees.

More of the money appropriated for education should be spent in country areas.  He was in favour of reading the Bible in schools.

Motions were carried declaring both candidates fit and proper persons to be elected.
