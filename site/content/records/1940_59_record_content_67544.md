Booborowie Institute, which has been supported by a scheme of donated land for cropping, will this year benefit from about 150 acres offered by ‘Anama’, of which nearly 100 acres is deemed arable.  Volunteers will be called to work the land, from which it is hoped to raise £1,000 towards the new building.  The project has in hand c. £4,300 and this addition should make it possible to build the new supper room, kitchen and cloak rooms, free from debt.  Miss Rosemary Pearce has resigned as librarian and it is hoped that Mrs Basil Billing, in whose home the library is located, will consent to accept the position.
