Cr Radford opposed this strongly and Cr Treloar agreed with him.  The Mayor thought no reasonable person would object to a portion of the rates being spent on the Recreation Grounds.  Cr Bartholomaeus said he opposed the motion, as a great deal of money had been spent there this year and last.  Motion lost.
