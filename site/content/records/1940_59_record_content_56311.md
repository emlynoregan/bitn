Weather.  Steady rain began to fall last Tuesday morning and it gradually extended to the east.  This proved to be the best brain for three years.  It is considered that to the east sufficient supplies of water have been caught to last 12 to 18 months.  The feed position previously had been very good and is now assured for a considerable time.  [The extensive list of rainfall figures printed shows falls ranging from 1 to 2 inches in the main.]
