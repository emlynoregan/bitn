Ron W. Chambers writes saying that some person or persons had an ‘all out’ attempt to sabotage the success of the Burra Football Club in staging the Grand Final at Victoria Park.  Rumours were spread that cars would not be admitted to the oval, except for official vehicles.  In fact the gate was a record £112, indicating that 900 attended.  Taking into account increased prices, this meant it compared with £97 taken at Spalding last year.  By the end of the first quarter 158 vehicles had been admitted and others came up to half-time.
