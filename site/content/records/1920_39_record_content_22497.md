RSL AGM was held 28 February.  President Dr D.M. Steele and Vice-President S.M. Lane.

The meeting discussed whether to close the clubrooms and the administration of the Discharged Soldier Settlement Act.

The men were also asked to attend the unveiling of the Burra & District Honour Roll by the Governor Sir Tom Bridges on 19 March in uniform to form a bodyguard.  This was likely to be the last function of the kind and they hoped for a good attendance.  A returned man had donated £15 to enable all returned soldiers to attend the banquet without cost.  S. Carter suggested that as most were reserves the Militia be written to for fresh uniforms.  Mr Cock suggested approaching headquarters of the RSL for help.  The attendance was larger than for some years.  [24 are named.]

The President said despite much effort to organise socials etc., especially when Mr Carthew was secretary, the clubrooms were little used and it was hard to keep them going financially.  Despite dances and boxing tournaments to help, they now had nothing but the assets.  Though the Eastern Telephone Syndicate had been generous the rent had still to be paid along with about £4 for light and £8 for cleaning.  Since Mr Dow was secretary the membership had increased from 24 in 1925 to 50 in 1926, of whom 44 were financial.  Seven years ago it was 200.  Even at the annual smoke social only 31 attended.

One reason for forming the RSL was to hear grievances and another was to give assistance.  Neither had been done in this branch – soldiers probably preferred to deal directly with headquarters, but the strength of the League would be greater with strong sub-branches.  Dr Steele said he would not stand again for President.  The secretary said that if the branch was to survive it needed 125 financial members.

Elected: President, L.M. Gordon; Vice-Presidents, J.E. Hogan, H.G. Oates & F. Spencer; Secretary & Treasurer, G.H. Dow.

The Government administration of the Soldier Settlement Act was severely criticised for the application of liens on crops.  The Government took all and the storekeepers etc. who gave credit got nothing.  They passed a motion asking for the Act to be changed to give soldiers title after six years instead of the stipulated 10 and for this to be retrospective.  Candidates for election to Parliament are to be asked to state their position on opening up new land as there are over 1,000 men still waiting.

Burra Reunion in the Botanic Gardens was held on 26 February.  The average age of those attending was about 60 and 210 wore identity cards.
