Mongolata School.  For some time the residents at Mongolata have been appealing for a school.  The number of children is present and costs would be moderate.  Mr W. Carpenter has worked hard to this end and all concerned were disappointed when on Wednesday last Mr McDonald MP wrote to say that the Mines Department has expressed its opinion that it could not vouch for the field being a permanency and consequently the Education Department would not proceed with a school.  Mr McDonald says he will not let the matter drop.  [The reporter thought the Department of Minesâ€™ stance was beyond understanding.]
