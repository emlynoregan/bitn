Fire Brigade

This question was again discussed by Council where Cr McBride reported on the Kapunda Brigade which came under the Fire Brigade Board.  The board paid ⅓ of the cost, insurance offices ⅓ and the Council ⅓.  There were two permanent men and a horse reel.  The Council contribution was £112 p.a. which was too costly for Burra.  Cr Radford said a horse reel was out of the question.  Cr Lane thought a hose and hydrant would be sufficient to cope in Burra.  Further discussion will follow.
