Burra Town Council 5 April

The Mayor asked Cr Riggs to report on the decision of the Hospital Board to reduce its size to seven.

Mr Riggs did so, saying that at the conclusion of their present term the seats of the five members elected by ratepayers would be declared vacant and there would be no re-election.

The Mayor then said that as he saw it the ratepayers were being disenfranchised.  He did not believe that election to the Board by Council meant an election by all ratepayers.  Also the town owned the hospital and effectively control of their own property was being taken out of their hands.

Cr Woollacott disputed the Mayorâ€™s interpretation of disenfranchisement.

Cr Kellaway was also strongly opposed to the motion carried by the Hospital Board.  He moved that a letter be sent to the Chief Secretary stating that the Council was of the opinion the institution should be governed by the direct voice of the people.  Cr Harris seconded.

Cr Riggs was surprised, as he had asked the Council what his position was in regard to questions arising at Board meetings and they had given him a free hand.  He felt he represented all ratepayers since he was elected by a body which was elected by them.  Why did not Cr Kellaway say he was opposed when the matter was before Council?

Cr Riggs said any effort made by Council to approach the Chief Secretary would be unconstitutional.  The motion was carried with Riggs & Woollacott opposed.

The Mayor had been absent when the matter was discussed in Council and he said no one seemed to realise the gravity of the proposal.
