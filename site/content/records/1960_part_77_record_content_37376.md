Editorial on a new era in farm management, with new technologies including computers to keep business records.  There are more scientific approaches to stock keeping and to growing grain and fodder crops, along with greater care of lambs, both before and after birth.  Consultant services are becoming more important and present the farmer with a wider range of strategies, policies and ideas.  Wool is being classified into trade types to sell in big even lines.   Insurance and travel arrangements are all changing and can be attended to over the phone.
