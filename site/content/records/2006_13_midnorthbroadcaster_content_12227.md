Bikies in Burra

Dozens of Finks bikies passed through Burra on Saturday afternoon on the return leg of their ‘defiance’ run to Broken Hill.  They had been to Broken Hill for a gathering with members from around Australia.  63 bikes descended on the BP service station to refuel and pick up food and drinks.  They were accompanied by more than 20 police officers on bikes and in vehicles.  The bikies were in the town for about an hour.
