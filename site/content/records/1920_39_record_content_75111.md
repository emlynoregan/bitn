Redruth Methodist Church celebrates its 88th anniversary.

Early records show that Rev. D.J. Draper opened the first Wesleyan Church in Kooringa in 1847 when there was no other place of worship within 70 miles and there were then only three Wesleyan and one or two Primitive Methodist ministers in the colony.  The first Bible Christian ministers came three years later.  Work was chiefly done by local preachers and about 60 members were reported.

Rev. John Harcourt came to reside in Burra in 1848 and had under his care also Princess Royal, Tothill Scrub, Kapunda & Angaston.  Primitive Methodist and Bible Christian ministers also covered as much ground.  At the first quarterly meeting on record John Boots was elected Circuit Steward, 191 people were in church fellowship and receipts of £56 included a Government grant of £28.

Redruth first appears on the quarterly minute book 24 June 1851, but no members are recorded and the income was 5/4.  Three months later there were four members and the income was £1-6-6.  In the preceding February Kooringa trustees began to build a church opposite the police court and £1-17-10 was collected at the laying of the foundation stone.  Mr R. Reed wheeled the mortar for building the church which cost £228 and was opened free of debt.

Next Sunday & Monday Redruth Methodism will celebrate its 88th anniversary.  The morning service will be taken by Rev. V. Secombe of Kooringa.  There will be a Pleasant Sunday Afternoon service and Rev. J.A. Andrews will take the evening service.  Monday will feature a social family gathering with a tea at 5.30 p.m. followed by a lantern show and a public meeting at 7.30.
