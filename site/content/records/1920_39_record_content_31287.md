The Waterloo Cup.

This is the most important coursing event in SA and when it was announced that it would be ‘run by’ the Burra Coursing Club for 1929 local men interested in coursing were thrilled.  President of the Burra Club Alex Ratcliffe and Honorary Secretary J. Carpenter and local representatives on the SA Coursing Club R.A. Lynch and S. Carter all worked hard to get the meeting here and to make arrangements to make all work smoothly.  The official card issued in the city made no reference to the local club and when SACC officials arrived for the meet the locals were snubbed.  Local officials it was made plain were not desired or required, nor even treated with common courtesy.  When H.E. the Governor attended on the second day there was not a local official at his table – neither Mr Ratcliffe nor Mr Carpenter was even invited to the luncheon.  When SACC asked for three complimentary tickets to the Ball run by the Burra Coursing Club they were refused.  The Burra Coursing Club spent some £60 for the privilege of having the cup run in the district.  The coursing itself was wonderfully successful and was won by R.K. Kitto of Moonta with his dog Tiger Sydric.
