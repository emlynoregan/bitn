Flight Lieutenant L.C. Shoppee of Australian Aerial Service Ltd is marking out suitable landing grounds for likely air routes and on Monday he called at Mr & Mrs N. Hiles Pearse at ‘The Gums’.  The cost of the proposed service will be 2/- per mile whether 1 or 4 persons are carried.  For four persons this is 6d per person cheaper than hiring a car.  From ‘The Gums’ Mr Shoppee was to land at Mrs Brown’s near the Morgan racecourse and thence to Mildura and Broken Hill.  The company carries the Adelaide-Broken hill mail.  Mr Shoppee is also interested in Wings Ltd, a new flying company at Broken Hill which is opening a flying school there.
