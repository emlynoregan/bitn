Burra Town Council, 1 July

The Local Government Department advises that gravelling the Aberdeen-Peterborough Road would be considered.

The Mayor said no ratepayersâ€™ meeting had been held this year and in view of the approaching centenary celebrations he thought one should be held.  It was resolved to have one on 31 July.
