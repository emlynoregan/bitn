Police Need at Kooringa

A memorial signed by over 300 people has been prepared for presentation to His Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor, calling for the Police Act to be extended to Kooringa.  It is essential that the inadequate police presence in the town be increased.  There are many absolute vagabonds infesting the place and scarcely a night passes without petty thefts.  Last Sunday night several horses and saddles were stolen.  These might have been recovered, but was deemed inexpedient to leave the town without police protection, which would have been the result if the two policemen here had taken up the pursuit.  James French, a carter at the Patent Copper Co.’s works, was knocked down and robbed of £4 in Burra orders, while on his way home last Sunday evening.  Afterwards he was followed home, apparently by confederates, who threatened to clean him out.
