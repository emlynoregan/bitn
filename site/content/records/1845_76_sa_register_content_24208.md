English & Australian Copper Co.

An extraordinary half-yearly meeting was held in the London Tavern. Conditions of the company were said to be improving, they having got over the small quantity of ore due to the closure of the Burra Mine and the very low copper prices.  Since July they had received ore at the rate of nearly 8,000 tons p.a. independent of the Burra supply.  Mr Routh hoped to be able to announce a dividend of 1/6 or 2/- at the end of the year.  They had sold 400 oxen and horses on completion of the railway to the port and had laid out a further £16,000 on their Port Adelaide wharf, making £35,000 in all spent on it.  It is expected to produce an income of £3,000 to £4,000 p.a.
