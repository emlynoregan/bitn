Railway Track Inspection

Australian Rail Group (ARG) ran a locomotive to Burra and Kapunda last Wednesday to inspect the condition of the track.  They wanted to use a heavier vehicle than the usual Toyota inspection ute fitted with small guide wheels.  While there are no plans to use the lines on a regular basis, there will be infrequent running of a locomotive for inspection purposes.  The engine ran first from Dry Creek through Roseworthy to Kapunda and then returned to Roseworthy before going on to Burra.  Goyder Council was asked to remove the bitumen seal from the tracks on the heavy vehicle bypass to allow the engine access to the Burra yard.
