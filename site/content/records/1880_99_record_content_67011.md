Obituary.  Mr Benjamin Franklin Langsford, who conducted the Record in Mr Holderâ€™s time and wrote articles on the City of Big-Big which appeared in the Burra Record some years ago, died in Adelaide last week through taking a dose of chlorodyne.  He could speak eight languages fluently and was of a moderate and sober character, but allowed his mind to dwell on petty grievances so that at times he lost control of himself.  [Registered as Benjamin Franklin Langford, died 5 October 1899 aged 73]
