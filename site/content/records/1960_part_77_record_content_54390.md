Characteristics of the 1970 paper.

Generally there seems to be a good coverage of local news, although some snippets in ‘Out and About’ hint at stories that did not appear.  For example there is a reference in December to a near drowning at the Burra Swimming Pool, which is not elsewhere reported.  St Joseph’s Convent closed with only very brief incidental references.  The Bon Accord Bridge was demolished with only the briefest of notes.  These do leave you wondering what else might have been missed.  The Burra Mine seems to be quite well documented.

Page 1 was reserved almost entirely for news.  Beyond that pages carry perhaps two columns of news out of the seven.  There is, however, little consistency about where regular features are located.

Articles are often printed in the pages 4-5 gutter and sometimes in the 3-6 gutter.

There are quite a lot of general interest stories and articles, including items direct from Parliament or from the Member of Parliament.  These are almost exclusively from the Conservative side of politics.  Other items seem to have been press releases from the Australian Canned Fruits Industry, the Federal Government, the State Government, the Wheat Board etc.

Photographs continue to be few in number, but occasionally they appear in the same week as the event occurred.
