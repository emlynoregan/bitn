Burra Swimming Pool

£500 is urgently needed to complete the pool by the end of the month.  This will enable completion of sheds and surrounds.  The actual pool and wading pool have been completed.  The final stage is the erection of appropriate dressing rooms.  A further subsidy of £750 has been granted provided we can match it in donations.  Preliminary work has been carried out and the approximate cost is estimated at £900 to £1,000: i.e. £500 of our money and £500 of Government subsidy.  The sheds would be concrete brick with roof, inside showers, toilets etc.  The pool has been booked by the Education Department for 5-16 January 1959 for a Learn to Swim Campaign.

Send donations to Mr Ted Orchard c/o Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. Ltd.

[A summary of receipts and payments is printed.]
