Badminton.  Eleven members of the Burra North Badminton Club visited Cadell to play their annual matches.  The contest was even and each side won 9 sets, but Burra came out on top by one point.

[Page 6 results appear to read differently, although the print is a bit unclear it seems to say Burra North 9-237 to 9-208, but perhaps it is a misprint there.]
