The final issue as the Burra Record.

The Burra Record will amalgamate with the Peterborough and Orroroo based paper, the Review Times, which in future will be the Review Times Record and which will be printed in Port Pirie by the latest offset process by Independent Newspapers Ltd.  This will be the final issue as the Burra Record.

The price of the enlarged paper will rise from 8c to 10c a copy.  R.E. & A.J. Angel will continue with their job printing and act as agents for the new paper, accepting advertsing, copy and photographs for it.  Representatives of the publishers will make periodical visits to Burra to assist advertisers with copy and layouts, in which photos and drawings will be more readily incorporated.  Advertisers should benefit from the larger circulation and more modern printing facilities.  The cost of production at Burra has been rising and it is increasingly hard to get replacement parts for the old machines.  Another reason for amalgamation is the retirement of the linotype operator Eric angel, who came to the office in 1929 and has been setting the type here for 45 years.  The office is not closing as a job printing service.
