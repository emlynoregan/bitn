The Ratepayers Action Group, (Regional Council of Goyder) has a full page open letter to Eudunda Ward Electors on the subject of the Goyder Sports and Community Centre.

[The position of the group has been adequately covered previously, but this is a very detailed outline of their position with all the questions they believe have to be addressed at the meeting of ward electors.]
