Continental.

A pleasant evening was spent at the Oval on Wednesday night last when a great military display and gran open-air concert took place with the proceeds going to aid the Corporation in liquidating the debt on the shed.  A procession headed by the Burra Brass Band left Market Square at 7.30.  Military exercises began the evening.  A one-mile bicycle race was contested with W. Tiver the winner.  The large shed was lit for the occasion and a concert followed.  Â£8-7-6 was taken at the gates.
