Geological & Proposed Development Report on Byles’ Mongolata GM by Theodore Price

Mining Geologist, on the field 14, 18, 19 & 20 September 1934.

First visited on the 14th and noticed the fractured and disturbed nature of the country with no promising formations likely to carry a permanent and reliable gold content.  But from certain metamorphic rocks, in the deeper parts of the mine especially, I concluded that no detrimental comments should be made before a thorough geological survey of the property and surroundings.

Subsequently I found a quantity of semi-decomposed creamy slate west of your workings, which was impressive.  Your workings have not gone far enough yet to intersect this line of formation.  What was impressive was that the solutions carrying the gold came in from the west at great depth in this zone and the country is more settled than at the present workings.  At the summit of the ridge I found a large lode formation 20-30ft wide capped with sedimentary rocks and encased on either side by layers of light blue slate.  Further west lie two large quartz lodes of entirely different characteristics.  Though heavily leached and unattractive to ordinary prospectors, they are to my mind the most attractive proposition on the field.  These are not on your property and are not held by anyone else.  The whole of this western section of the field should be pegged out and surveyed.

[Subsequent comments below suggest that this was done before the rest of the report was produced.]

[Price then describes the general location and geology of Mongolata at some length.]

Extremely rich pockets of heavy coarse gold have been found in certain catchments for the precipitation of the solutions and gases, usually where a small fault, dislocation or disturbance in the country has taken place.  Apart from rich pockets there is an enormous tonnage of surface stuff at certain zones that may prove by systematic investigation a payable proposition to work on a large scale by surface methods.

The sulphide zone has not yet been reached.  At best a semi-sulphide lode has been struck at 263ft.  It would be interesting to see the structural formations of this load at depth and at least 100ft beyond the present workings.  The average work done so far does not assist in forming a definite opinion of the extent or possibilities of the field.  So far it looks as if everyone has been seeking the rich pockets and has not been concerned in the possibilities of striking a large and permanently payable body of ore in the settled strata.

The present position of the mine warrants immediate expansion by way of opening up a method whereby to test and mine the big lode at the foot of the winze.  Water is a problem and eventually a shaft will have to be put down several hundred feet ahead of the workings.

Now that the western portion of the field has been secured and attractive lode formations located there, I strongly recommend considering driving of the northern section of the tunnel which is now at 405ft into the hillside, to the centre of the outcropping lode formation, which according to the distances given me by the surveyor the actual distance to drive will be 671ft.  I prepared a general plan and a working plan.  In addition it will be necessary to sink a shaft to connect up with the tunnel at 195ft from the proposed starting point.  This is necessary for ventilation and later will be deepened to work the 20ft lode.  When this has been done you will know you have a valuable goldfield that can be worked on an economic system and if the lodes prove too poor to work you will have secured that knowledge for a moderate outlay.
