The Strikes.

In SA the trouble is increasing with difficulties in Adelaide, Pt Adelaide, Pt Pirie and Pt Augusta.  Shipping has virtually halted.  The Premier is being restrained, apparently thinking rushing police to the port will only inflame matters.

In Burra coal supplies in the town are better than earlier reported and good for several months.  The train and mail service is rather erratic.  There are few shearers about and although matters are unclear a strike of shearers is possible this week.
