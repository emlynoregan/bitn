The London Exhibition

[There is a lengthy report on the Exhibition with quite a section on ‘The South Australian Court’.]

The display of copper in its crude and purer states is very fine.  An entire table is occupied with samples sent from the Moonta and Wallaroo Mines, the Burra Burra Mine, the All Nations Mine at Kooringa [?] and Mr F.C. Singleton’s section near Mt Barker.  The Moonta collection is the richest of all with specimens yielding from 35 to 47 and 60%.  Wallaroo proprietors sent specimen ores varying from 20?% to a natural coarse copper yielding 98.57%.  Burra Burra proprietors sent nothing, but Hon. H. Ayers MLC sent a cabinet full of small specimens.

Other displays are bags of wheat, flour, and oats and jars and pots of fruits etc. and some very fine raisins.  J. Tidmarsh & Co. of Adelaide sent half a cwt of soap.  There is also a display of agricultural machinery and some 610 samples of wines and liqueurs.  Simpson & Son sent a patent fire-proof safe.  J.M. Wendt sent silverware including a fine candelabrum in the shape of a fern tree and an epergne in the form of a gum tree.  There are specimens of woods from the Northern Territory.

‘Mr B. Herschel Babbage is representative commissioner for South Australia and has worked untiringly to present the South Australian exhibits.  He is a son of the eminent calculator and he exhibits a drawing of a portion of his father’s calculating machine and a book of sketches made by himself during his exploration of the interior in 1848 when he discovered Lakes Gregory and Eyre.’
