Kooringa Flood.  Last night (25 January) the greatest flood that has yet occurred struck Kooringa.  Little rain fell before 11 p.m., but the mail driver reported passing through a heavy shower just south of the town on the Adelaide road.  Shortly before 11 p.m. it began to rain heavily with thunder and lightning.  The creeks coped with the run-off till near midnight, when the water began rushing down the main street.  Two bullock drays, which had been left near the road, were carried through the street to the bottom.  Large logs were also carried along and an immense volume of water rushed down the street to the creek.  The storm reached its height at about 4 a.m.  Damage has been considerable.  Part of the Hotel Garden’s fence was swept away.  Dr Mayne’s house was flooded to a considerable depth and valuable furniture was damaged.  His stable was under water and the Shetland pony had to swim for it.  Fencing and two tons of firewood were lost.  Losses are put at about £200.  Nearby the house of the miner named Godden was completely carried away, except for two walls.  All clothing, furniture and a considerable sum of money was swept along with the water.  The bridge near the Catholic Chapel was carried away and nearby houses flooded so their chairs and tables were afloat.  Fred Gurney, the mail driver, rescued his wife and children and then had to leave with the mail.  One side of Mr Gubbins’ house was carried away along with some of his stock.  The footbridge in Kangaroo Street went next and Mr Roberts’ store was then engulfed.  The waters carried away the wall around the property and one side wall of the shop, filling the cellar and inflicting about £500 damage on stores of sugar and other groceries.  Mr Pearce’s fence went next, but a large stone behind one of the posts supporting the Queen Street footbridge, saved that structure.  Debris from the flooded houses piled up here, diverting more water down the street.  Towards the bottom of the street the shops of Stephens the carpenter and Lane the saddler bore the full force of the torrent.  The side of Stephens’ shop was swept away and Lane’s shop was lifted bodily and carried 40 yards with its contents intact.  Mr Lane awoke to find the house moving and leapt out of bed to be up to his body in water.  In the middle of the street the depth must have been six feet.  Along the Burra Creek all the bridges were carried away except the Company’s stone bridge.  Many huts in the bank were flooded and the occupants were glad to have made their escape.  Many will not return to them.  Although the destruction of property was great, no lives were lost.
