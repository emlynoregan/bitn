Kooringa News, 15 November

Last Wednesday night between 11 and 12 p.m. an unoccupied house belonging to Mt J.C. Barclay was discovered to be on fire.  Amazingly the timber building was saved with only trifling damage.  The house has been unoccupied for the last seven or eight weeks and was insured for £200.  The inquest was delayed till Saturday to allow the representative of the insurance company to be present.  The inquest was held at the Miners’ Arms, but little was determined as to the cause of the fire, although the jury decided that the fire was wilfully occasioned by person or persons unknown.

Numbers of people continue to prepare to depart for Newcastle and tradesmen here don’t know what will be the result of this extensive migration.

The election so far has not produced a single meeting here or an organisation of any kind.  I have heard that Mr Neales intends to visit the town before nomination day, which is next Thursday.  There is still no sign of any opposition.
