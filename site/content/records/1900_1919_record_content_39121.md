West Burra Copper Mine: The report of H. Jones, Inspector of Mines.  9 October 1914.

The main underlie shaft is at 100’ from 62’ it is in dislocated ground which becomes more settled after 90’ which justifies further testing by crosscutting.  Sinking to water level is continuing.  The lode formation at 50’ in the main shaft is promising.
