Telstra Tower.  A conference in Burra including Telstra, consultants, environmentalists and an archaeologist was held on 12 & 13 November.  Part of the exercise was to raise a cherry-picker again on Brewery Hill to assess the impact of such a structure on various sites in the town.  The report to the Australian Heritage Commission will cover all the issues raised by them in earlier correspondence.
