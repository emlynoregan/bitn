Thomas Roberts was in charge and was appointed Captain at 35/- a week.

The first load was a two-ton lump of red oxide that assayed at 71¼% copper.

Pickett lives a further six years and died 18 November 1851 of accidental burns in a hut near the present crossing of the Baldina creek.  He was given a pauper’s burial in the old Burra Cemetery.  On an appeal from Mr Ware, the owner of the present Burra Hotel (then called the Miners’ Arms) the SA Mining Association forwarded 5 guineas to cover the funeral expenses.  Today at long last the discoverer of the Burra Mine is being honoured.

[Mr Auhl then referred to several letters he had received from descendents of the first miners.]

Mr Stanley Woollacott then dedicated the plaque to Thomas Pickett and Mr Warren Bonython then moved a vote of thanks to the Burra Burra Branch of the National Trust in his capacity as President of the National Trust of SA.
