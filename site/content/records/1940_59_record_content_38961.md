Sheep Losses.  Last week’s rains may have been a blessing to many farmers and pastoralists, but the accompanying cold wind with the driving rain has resulted in a loss across the district of some 6,000 freshly shorn sheep.  The loss includes many stud ram and ewe lambs.  While exact numbers are not obtainable, it is known that about 5,000 dead sheep can be accounted for in the strip of country along the railway line between Hallett and Farrell Flat and about 1,000 died in the Booborowie area.  In money terms the losses must amount to something like £10,000 at the very least.  Pastoralists to the east have not reported any losses.
