Burra Burra Show Society: Annual Report by the outgoing President Mr Rob Jamieson.

The 113th Annual Report presented at the AGM.

[The 1990 show was the 98th.  It is possible annual reports were produced for years without shows in 1897, 1914 and 1940 to 1945, but not during a period when the society was moribund 1886-1893.]

Despite kinder weather gate takings continued to decline.  Horse, sheep, wool, flowers, birds, grain and fodder entries were up, but childrenâ€™s craft, needlework, fruit, vegetables and produce entries were a little disappointing.  In the year the poultry pavilion was extended.  Jock Duncan opened the show.

Office Bearers for 1991: Patron, Brian Riggs; President, Ian Slade; Vice-Presidents, Andrew McInnes & Rick Williams and Secretary, Jean Jamieson.
