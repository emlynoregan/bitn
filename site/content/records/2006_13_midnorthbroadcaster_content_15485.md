The Teliqua Lizard Crawl drew 61 participants to see pygmy bluetongues.  Four plots were examined and each of the four groups examined each plot.  The weather was rather cold and windy and this meant that the lizards were in their holes rather than basking outside.  An average of 25 lizards was located by each group over the four plots compared with 32 located by the experts.  Everyone got a good look at the lizards in their holes using optical fibrescopes.
