A Bolt.  On Monday morning Dr Dashwood was driving a two-wheeled buggy between Redruth and Kooringa when the horse shied at some children sitting on the bank near the Telegraph Station.  It bolted up the hill, capsizing the buggy and throwing the Doctor out.  The vehicle was then righted and the horse turned down the hill and made it to the road again, in the process capsizing the buggy and throwing out the other occupant, a small boy.  The horse then parted from the vehicle and continued through the creek and up the Smelting Work’s Hill dragging part of the wreckage.  Eventually it ran into Welsh Creek and ran along it towards the Mine Store where it was eventually caught.  Neither passenger was much hurt.
