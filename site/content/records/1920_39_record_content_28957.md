Accident.  An accident occurred on the Adelaide Rd Â¾ mile south of Kooringa on Friday.  Mr Wilfred Nankivell with his wife, three children and his sister Miss Olive Nankivell were in a buggy when involved in a head-on collision with a car driven by R.A. Lewis.  The pole and swingle-tree were smashed and one of the two ponies had to be destroyed.  The occupants of the buggy were thrown out.  Mrs Nankivell sustained a nasty injury to her arm, the baby less than seven months old was shaken and strained its back, Mr Nankivell was cut about the eye, one other child was bruised and another unhurt.  Miss Nankivell received minor scratches.  The car was badly damaged.  Mr Lewis and a lady passenger received minor injuries and Mrs Lewis was unhurt.  A tin of petrol burst and soaked the baby and vegetables.  All are now progressing satisfactorily.
