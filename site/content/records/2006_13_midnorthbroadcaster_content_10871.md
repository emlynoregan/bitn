MFS Service ends in Burra

Yesterday the Country Fire Service took over completely from the Metropolitan Fire Service in Burra.  With a limited number of volunteers to serve the CFS, MFS, SES and SAAS it was decided to consolidate the fire service.  The MFS had operated in Burra for almost 90 years.
