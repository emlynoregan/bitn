Bridge over the Light

The bridge over the Light about a mile south of Kapunda is approaching completion.  It consists of three arches, composed of sawn timbers, bent to the segment of a circle, strongly bolted together, with their ends resting on ironwork imbedded in the piers and abutments.  The platform is wood with a metalled roadway.
