W.H. Lyod [sic: for Lloyd] wrote a paper for the Ironmine Social Soc.  It reveals some aspects of rural communications for the period.  There was no post office at Leighton or Ironmine and the telephone links were poor and very costly.  Phone rental was 30/- per mile so that 10 miles from the exchange the rent of Â£15 p.a. was beyond the means of many.
