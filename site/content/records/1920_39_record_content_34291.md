Burra Town Council, 19 May

The RSL again wrote about the guns, calling for a private meeting between the Council and three members of the RSL executive and a representative of the trustees of the guns, to reach an amicable conclusion.

Cr Woollacott said he was tired of the issue, but as long as no side issues were allowed he would support such a meeting.  Seconded Cr Kellaway.

Cr Pearse asked who the trustees were.

The Town Clerk said: E.W. Crewes, M.A. Radford, E.J. Davey & S.M. Lane.

Cr Woollacott said he believed Mr Radford held the position as a Councillor and that therefore he had succeeded to that position and similarly E.W. Crewes had been succeeded by the Mayor and the Town Clerk continued in that capacity.

The Mayor held that the trustees had been permanently appointed.

Cr Pearce moved an amendment that the letter lie on the table for a fortnight.  Carried.
