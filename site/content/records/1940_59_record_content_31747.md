Victoria Park.

The Victoria Park Improvement Committee has asked the Mayor to hold a ratepayers’ meeting to discuss the matter of the Council handing over to it the sum of £400 now held by the Council for the purpose of building a swimming pool.  The Mayor has said he was not prepared to hold a meeting for this purpose on the same night as the ordinary ratepayers’ meeting, but was prepared to hold a special meeting to discuss the issue.  The money had been obtained from the Government to build a swimming pool.  Permission was then obtained to divert the funds to building a grandstand at Victoria Park.  Still later permission had been obtained to re-divert the money to building a swimming pool.  He though a further change would make the Council look ridiculous in the eys of the Government.  Cr Reed said he was against giving the Committee the £400.  Cr Lee also thought such a move would make the Council look ridiculous.  The Mayor has called a ratepayers’ meeting to consider the matter on 14 July.
