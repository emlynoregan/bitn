Burra Town Council, 5 April

The Municipal Assoc. advises that dogs are not allowed in the streets except on a leash or under effective control, but it is a matter on the agenda for the next meeting of the Association.

M.W. Bednall advised that a committee of two councillors should meet with him concerning the new by-laws.  Several of them were unsuitable for this Council and several of the old ones should be retained.  Crs Worth and Dow were so appointed.

There was a discussion about damage at Victoria Park and about whose responsibility it was to care for the site and to report damage.

Cr Dow said the problem was ‘travellers’ who camped there and used the seating etc. for firewood.  The police are to be informed and asked to act.

Three of the town’s ministers had asked if the Council wanted a Coronation Service in the Institute on 12 May at 10.30 a.m.   Council advised them they would be pleased that such a service was held.

The Town Clerk advised that only one person had replied to the notice that those plying for hire needed a licence to carry goods.

Cr Dow moved legal proceedings be taken against those carrying goods and plying for hire without licences.  Carried.

The Chapel St Bridge is to be widened by 2ft and put in order.

Complaints have been received about traffic control in the streets on Fridays in particular.  Police will be asked to direct their attention to this.

The weighbridge in Aberdeen had been condemned to the inconvenience of the public.  The Inspector is to be written to for reconsideration of the decision.
