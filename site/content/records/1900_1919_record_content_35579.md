Commercial St Changes.

The west end of the street is being improved.  Mr C.A. Lott has almost completed building the garage for Vivian Lewis Ltd.  It is substantial and handsomely fitted out.

Messrs C.J. Pearce & Son are erecting a new shop and showrooms with a fine frontage to the street, a great improvement on the old.  A number of handsome private residences have recently been erected, or are in course of erection.
