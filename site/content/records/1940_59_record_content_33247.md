As Others See Us.  A reprint of an article from the Kadina & Wallaroo Times of a visit to Burra by Salvation Army Envoys.  They came from Adelaide via Gawler, Kapunda, She-oak Log & Greenock.  [Sic: though logically Kapunda should come last in the list.]  The writer comments on wide streets, frost, Paxton Square, homes that are nice and well-kept, the War Memorial & Rotunda, the Market Square Well and the bare hills.
