The Burra Races.  The Burra Cup was run last Saturday in cool, but windy conditions, which raised an almost unbearable dust. Acceptances were down and together with some scratchings the fields were rather small.  The Burra Cup was won by Mr J. Richardson’s Money Spider ridden by F. Wright.  Other results are printed.  The gate of £214 was £9 down on last year.
