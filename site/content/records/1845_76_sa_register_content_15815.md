Kooringa News, 1 August

The Local Court sat yesterday and attracted considerable interest because on of the cases was to be tried by jury as allowed for under the amended Local Courts Act.  It was an action for wages: Grey v. Tyler.  The defendant failed to enter an appearance and after a lot of legal argument the case was referred to arbitration and the jury was not required.

In the next case Tovey sued Waite for breach of contract and wrongful dismissal.  The verdict was for the plaintiff for the amount of services rendered, with each side to pay its own costs.

Following wet weather the roads are in a frightful state and the main street is one continuous ‘slough of despond’.  Accidents are common.  Yesterday Opie’s conveyance was just past the Mine Store when one wheel went into a hole and the other ran against a huge stone.  The cart capsized, throwing the driver, J. Hockin, violently to the ground.  Fortunately no bones were broken, though he was severely bruised.

This morning as the same conveyance was leaving for Kapunda with two or three passengers when the shaft horse lost its footing and fell.  Mr Opie was precipitated into the quagmire and Mrs Mitchell only escaped the same fate by grasping the harness as she fell on top of the horse.

Some wags are talking of setting up a regatta on Lake Winnall in the centre of Commercial Street with a pair of mud boots as the prize; to be competed for before the Road Board drains the lake when repairing the road.
