R. Fuss writes again complaining of the arrogance of the Town Council in dismissing the views of the ratepayer and proceeding to destroy trees in haste.  He concludes: ‘There have been more trees destroyed in the last few years than for 50 or 60 years previously.  This state of affairs calls for drastic action in protest from the ratepayers.’
