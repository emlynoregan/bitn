Burra Town Council, 20 May

The Fire Brigade has written denying their practice callout could have disturbed hospital patients.  It says the Brigade has to test the water pressure at all parts of the town.

A Government proposal to allow men to do some paid work without losing rations was discussed.  It was seen unfair that city Councils did not have to match this offer £ for £, while country Councils were compelled to do so.  The possibility of employing men to plant trees was discussed.

Cr Jeffery raised the matter of adjusting ward boundaries.  He wanted the south boundary of North Ward moved south to include that newly developed part of East Ward, which was accessed from North Ward.  [Graham, east of the Burra Creek and south of St Just St.]

The Town Clerk said he thought a referendum would be needed and a previous one on this issue had been defeated by a large majority.  He will investigate and report back.

Cr Kellaway thought perhaps North, South, East and West Wards were needed.

Cr Sampson complained at some length abut recent reports in the Burra Record over the request to form a saucer cycle track at Victoria Park.  He believed the reports implied he was not efficient at his job.  He could, he said, have easily made the track without injury to the oval’s playing surface.

Cr Kellaway said he had never questioned Cr Sampson’s ability, but he did not think that gentleman had taken into account the rocky nature of the surface and the very shallow depth of the soil that had been placed there.  He said that in the discussion on the topic Cr Sampson’s name had not been mentioned.

The Council discussed re-election intentions.

The Mayor, T.H. Woollacott, said he would stand again, as he would like to be Mayor for the Centenary Year, 1936.

Cr Dow was prepared to stand again, if no one else came forward.
