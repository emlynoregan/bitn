The Burra Art Society was established by Patricia Brereton more than 20 years ago.  It meets monthly in the Show Hall to create personal works of art in different media. Each year they aim to have two 2-day workshops and a sketching camp or studio visit.  The group has a collection of books and DVDs for loan to members.
