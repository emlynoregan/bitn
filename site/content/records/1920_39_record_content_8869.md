Obituary/Accident.  On Wednesday 4 November a car carrying five passengers struck a bad bar in the road near Diprose’s Bridge and the front wheel collapsed resulting in the vehicle’s turning over.  Passengers and luggage were scattered in all directions.  Mrs Frank Ford, who lives opposite the site, rendered assistance while the driver, W. Goward, went into Kooringa for help.  J. Allen & Stan Kellaway motored out and went for Dr Ashton.  Mr Walter Lee went out with the ambulance.  George Wallace (67) and Thomas King (57) were sent to the hospital in the ambulance.  Dr Ashton examined William Taylor, Stanley D. Gurr and Pierce Wilkinson who were taken in by ambulance when it returned.  Taylor had head injuries and so did Gurr, who also had a broken bone in his leg.  Wilkinson had less serious abrasions.  Wallace had spinal injuries and a frightful gash on the head.  King had a gash on the head, and severe chest injuries as well as facial abrasions.  The driver’s injuries were minor and the car not badly damaged.  Mr Wallace died on Tuesday morning.  Mr King remains in a serious condition, but slightly improved.  [His death 20 August 1923 at Mt Cone Station reveals his name to have been Andrew Thomas King McLaughlin of St Kilda Victoria, then aged 59.]  [George Wallace died at Kooringa 10 October 1922 aged 67.]
