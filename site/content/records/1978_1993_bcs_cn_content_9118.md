Show Day was a great success.  It was opened by Mr Richard James, Managing Editor of the Stock Journal.  With the co-operation of the Copper Festival Committee we were able to have a Country Rock Band playing throughout the day and a steam train brought about 190-200 visitors to give a record crowd.  Most sections were well supported.  The dog section was reinstated, but entries were a little disappointing.  The Flower Section missed the energetic personal attention of Mr S. Scroop who died during the year.
