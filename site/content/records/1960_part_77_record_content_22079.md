title: The organ in St Mary’s was installed in 1904 when provision was made to add
  several ranks of pipes, or ‘stops’ so complete the tonal range.  To date this has
  not been done, but now the Rector Rev. G.D. Sibly has been able to purchase a second
  hand rank to complete the ‘Great Organ’.  These pipes will be installed this week.  Rev.
  Sibly hopes to be able to announce that the £75 cost has been donated.  £20 has
  already been received.  Organist Dr J.V. Peters will give a recital for the 116th
  Patronal Festival of the parish next Sunday.
