Burra Mine.  Nothing new to report.  Everything is going along satisfactorily with a vast amount of stuff in sight.  The lode has turned to the north, but the work is going on testing the ground to the northeast.  A rise being put in has found some excellent cuprite.  Captain Hancock is expected daily from Broken Hill to do a full report on the whole mine.
