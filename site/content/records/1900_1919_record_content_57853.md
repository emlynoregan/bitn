Lighting Account

The year began with a debit of £8-10-11 and ends with a debit of £30-9-4.  The high cost of carbide was a major problem and had we not reduced lighting times the debt would have been worse.  Costs rose from £7-10-0 to £9-10-0 per lamp.  Various offers to install electricity have been made, but high costs of machinery etc. due to the war made Council defer a decision.  In the meantime arrangements have been made with some private firms to provide a few electric lights.
