W.J. Denny.

His speech was devoted to the then current clash between the House of Assembly and the Legislative Council over the reform of the latter.

W. Miller continued on the same theme.

Mr Goode continued on the franchise and on other matters currently blocked by the Upper House, which was ‘on strike’.

Mr Jackson continued on the franchise.

Mr J. Newland basically thanked electors for his recent success and for the success of this Labor Party Social as well as endorsing the reforms already canvassed.  The Party had had some local concerns brought to their attention, which would be addressed on their return to Adelaide.

Mr O’Loughlin proposed a vote of thanks to those assisting in making the meeting a success.

Mr Miller proposed the vote of thanks to the chairman.

Mr Davis suitably replied.

Refreshments and a ball followed.
