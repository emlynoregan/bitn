Short & Sharp

Grasshoppers have appeared in the town.

A meeting of the Burra club was held in the Burra Institute on Friday evening.

Thomas Best killed a snake over five feet long on Friday.

Burra Mine.  Results of the 100 tons raised for special treatment are awaited anxiously.

Work on the shaft at St Mary’s Church was resumed yesterday.  Messrs Rosewall & Harris have hopes of something shortly, but the stone is tough.  [Blasting at this site was not possible.]

Mr Hayes of Mt Bryan who is 99 is in the Burra Hospital with a sprained knee obtained while out rabbiting.
