Burra Burra DC, 3 September

1,100 sheep have been camped at King Dam for some weeks and are a concern that will be followed up.  The responsible parties have been asked to move them.

The year ended £1,304 in credit, with some outstanding commitments.  This largely results from a special grant of £1,500 from the Highways & Local Government Department for the Main Road 46 deviation.
