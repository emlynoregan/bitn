Court.

On the information of M-C Jemison, George Buchanan and John Arthur Riggs were charged with furious riding in Kingston St on 4 June.  Mr Winnall appeared for the defendants, who pleaded not guilty.  Alex. Harris Jun. swore he saw them ride up the street at 16 m.p.h. from in front of his father’s shop.  William March thought them both a bit merry when they emerged from the Kooringa Hotel and lined up their horses for the start.  He said they rode at least at 15 m.p.h.

John Arthur Riggs said they cantered as far as Geach’s house when he saw his father in a trap and slowed to a walk to allow it to overtake them.  He was quite sober – did 4-5 m.p.h.

Buchanan essentially confirmed the above as did evidence from J.H. Riggs.

The case was dismissed as was the further charge against George Buchanan of using indecent language.
