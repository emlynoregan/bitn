The SA Mining Association, the SA Company and Champagne

Under the heading Original Correspondence, R.M. Lyon Milne writes in a letter supposedly addressed to the Directors of the SA Mining Association:

Gentlemen – I accidentally visited the Company’s port last Tuesday and my attention was drawn to a gaily decorated ship and shout of conviviality nearby.  I was told the SA Company had invited you to a champagne lunch, because of the opening of the northern end of their wharf, professedly for your accommodation.

The hilarity of the moment seemed to be very great.

I cannot say whether the ships were joyed to have arrived after shivering in the southerly winds, or were enjoying the shallows after tossing about on the depths, or were pleased to be huddled together to celebrate the wonders of a maritime monopoly, or whether it was due to the champagne.

Some people, were they to witness the scenes of jollity, would comment on this loving place of ours, where even the arriving ships cannot celebrate without becoming the centre of gossip.

Alas how little do the ships imagine that there are rocks beneath the mud of the port.
