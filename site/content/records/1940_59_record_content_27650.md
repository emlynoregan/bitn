Accident.  Last Saturday night Mr Bert Beinke was driving a Model T buckboard to Booborowie Hall with Mrs G.P. Beinke, Messrs Stan, Viv & Bill Beinke and Master Mick Beinke.  In the township he swerved to avoid the stationary car of Mr G. J. Tohl.  Simultaneously the near side front tyre burst and the driver temporarily lost control.  The buckboard flipped onto its back, throwing Mr Viv Beinke clear and pinning the others beneath.  Fortunately lots of help was at hand and the passengers were quickly freed.  Messrs Stan, Bert and Viv Beinke were bleeding profusely from head and hand injuries and Viv appeared to be concussed.  Mrs Beinke and Master Beinke escaped with bruises and shock.  After medical attention it appears none were seriously injured, but the vehicle was considerably damaged.
