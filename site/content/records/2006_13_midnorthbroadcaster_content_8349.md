SA Living Artists Festival (SALA) was launched in Burra at Market Square on Sunday when about 130 people congregated to hear former Senator Chris Schacht open the festival and to hear the Clare band ‘Tumbadrum’ and Burra band ‘The Sore Foot Effect.’  The SA entry ‘Kelly’ in the 2009 Solar Challenge aroused interest.  A sausage sizzle and home made cakes provided sustenance and the Sing Australia Choir directed by John Fuss added their contribution, as did the three remaining Burra Bootscooters: Colleen Spackman, Shirley Broad and Pat Kakoschke.  The festivities continued at the Regional Art Gallery where the ‘Throwing Light’ display was exhibited by several artists along with a Latin dance demonstration.
