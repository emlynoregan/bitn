The Waterworks

The Town Clerk reported that the engineer had left on Saturday and they had taken proceedings against him as decided at the special meeting of Council.

On Tuesday the Town Clerk, Mr J.D. Cave, had taken over the Waterworks and placed Mr Simpson in charge temporarily.  It had been found on examining the books that £36-8-0 was owing to the Council by the engineer and he was given notice to pay that amount.

He had paid some on Saturday and the balance that morning.
