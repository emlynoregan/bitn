Mt Bryan CWA Branch at their last meeting honoured the late Mrs Hawker who was the chief instigator 23 years ago in the formation of the branch and was its first President.  It was chiefly her untiring effort and enthusiasm in the early years that helped mould an active and interesting branch at Mt Bryan.
