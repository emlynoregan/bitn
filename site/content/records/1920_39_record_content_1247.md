Burra Town Council, Monday

C. & A. Fuss complain of difficulty in getting information to the curator of the cemetery when a grave is required to be dug.  Mr Fuss complained of being treated in an off-hand manner when he phoned the Town Clerk recently.  The Town Clerk maintained it was not his duty, but Mr Fuss’s to find the curator.

Cr Kellaway thought that 6d spent on a telegram would solve Mr Fuss’s problem.  The curator reported no problem with other undertakers who gave him all possible time to prepare a grave.  The Messrs Fuss sometimes did not.  Letter received.

Cr Broderick suggested placing a streetlamp on the corner opposite Snell’s Hotel.  Left with Ward Councillors.
