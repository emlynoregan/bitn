Johnny Green.  The background to Johnny Green is repeated and then:

Johnny Green was presented to the town by Messrs A.J. & P.A. McBride and has for some years been in the Council Depot.  Council recently decided to put him on a platform on a suitable site.  Mr Treloar was asked for an inscription and his reply was:

‘Johnny Green, Mascot of Burra Mine discovered in 1845, closed in 1877.  It gave SA and its early pioneers their financial start in life by creating employment and encouraging land settlement.  Erected by the Corporation of Burra.’

The Overseer said there was plenty of iron rod on which to erect Johnny.  Originally it had been a weather cock.  The effigy weighs about 30lb.  A.J. & P.A. McBride’s permission to erect the effigy on their land on a site to be chosen near the Mine Bridge will be sought.  The whole Council will inspect and choose a site.
