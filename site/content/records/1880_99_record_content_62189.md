Easter at Burra.

Good Friday passed quietly with picnic excursions to Princess Royal and the Lagoon.  The Holdfast Bay Model Brass Band arrived on the midday train and played several selections at the Hospital with a sacred concert at the Institute in the evening.

On Saturday they went to Princess Royal and played and in the evening gave a concert on the balcony of the Commercial Hotel.

On Sunday afternoon and evening they played at the Wesleyan Church and subsequently gave an open-air concert in Market Square.

On Monday they played at the sports and in the evening at the Institute before leaving for home on Tuesday morning.

[A list of the items they played is printed.]
