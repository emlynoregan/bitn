SA Occupational Health and Safety Commission has released a public discussion paper on child safety on farms.  The Member for Custance, Ian Venning urges farmers to look at the paper seriously and to respond.  Although farms are undoubtedly dangerous work places, the Government must not automatically resort to regulation to solve a problem at the expense of discouraging children from becoming involved in farming at all.  Self-regulation has to be the best way of solving child safety problems.  The SAFU became involved when the Minister, Bob Gregory, realised there were ways other than regulation that could be employed in solving the problem.  Copies of the paper are available free of charge and public comment is sought until 31 May 1993.
