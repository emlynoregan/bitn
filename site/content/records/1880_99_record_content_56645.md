Local board of Health.

D.J. O’Leary advised he would be glad if Council could find another site for their rubbish dump.

There was a letter from nine ratepayers complaining of the putrid smells from boiling down operations in Aberdeen and asking they be abated.

The Mayor said the matter had been dealt with at their last meeting and notices had been served.  To ensure a sound basis in case law another order had been prepared by the Central board of Health to be passed by this meeting.  This was then done.
