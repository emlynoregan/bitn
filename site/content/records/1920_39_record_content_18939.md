‘Returned Soldier’ outlines his credentials as a soldier following Mr Collins’s last sally: ‘enlisted 1914, served in Egypt & France, I was wounded in France in 1916, was sent to England.  After many months in hospitals, I was boarded and marked “B2B” which means permanently unfit for His Majesty’s Forces.’
