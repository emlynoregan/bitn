Burra Burra DC

A number of people expressed concern about the burning off along Burra Creek

Council advises that the Burra & District Advisory Committee requested the area be cleaned up.  They suggested fencing and sheep grazing.  Council experience was that this was not feasible and decided on burning.  The timing was aimed at removing flammable material before the Easter influx of tourists when a number of open fires were lit â€“ some on a fire ban day.  Had the area not been burnt the town could have been endangered.  Two or three weeks earlier would have been a preferable date, but EFS personnel were not then available.  Damage to trees was minimal and the burnt area is now cleared in preparation for the implementation of the Creek Beautification Project.
