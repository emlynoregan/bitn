Redruth Methodist Sunday School held its Christmas tree on Wednesday 17 December.  Three ladies were presented with gifts in recognition of their long and faithful Sunday school service: Misses A. & M.G. Bentley and Miss E.W. Bryce.  Miss A. Bentley has served the Kindergarten as Superintendent since it was formed about 40 years ago.  Miss M.G. Bentley has also been associated with the Sunday school for many years as a scholar and teacher.  Miss Essie Bryce has been a teacher in the Sunday school for 13 years and for the last eight years has been Superintendent of the Primary Department.  Miss A. Bentley was given a flower trough.  Miss M.G. Bentley received a plate and saucer set and Miss Bryce was given an all purpose fancy jug.  These ladies ended their term of service to the Sunday school at the annual meeting held after the School Anniversary Services.
