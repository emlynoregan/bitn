Sparks Column.

‘A big sale Friday last.’

One Squatter in the east is killing his sheep, saying the skins are worth more than the sheep.

Court Unity intends to start a female lodge.

The drought to the east is bringing kangaroos and emus close in to Burra.  Rabbits are marching onwards by the thousand.

Obituary.  Mr Jobson’s only son died at Booleroo Centre last week.

[Christopher Jobson born 13 August 1880, died 25 October 1895 aged 15.]
