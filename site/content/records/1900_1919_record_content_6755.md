Court.

There is a one column account of a case over the theft of 1/9 worth of rope involving E.J. Burns alias James Brown and a lad called John Willis.  Burns/Brown was fined 30/- or 7 days.  Willis, who was only a young lad, had actually taken the rope, but the JPs decided that Burns/Brown was the responsible party in a case of conspiracy.  Willis was let off with a warning.
