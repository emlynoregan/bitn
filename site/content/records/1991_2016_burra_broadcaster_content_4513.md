Burra Burra DC advises that reports indicate the Kingston Street Bridge that dates from c. 1878 has reduced flexibility because of design standards when built and the installation of concrete decking in 1933.  Overweight vehicles would not cause it to crack, but to collapse.  Consequently it has a load limit of 8 tonnes gross.  Strengthening is not an option because the superstructure would have to be removed.
