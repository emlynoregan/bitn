Booborowie Requirements

On 15 November about 120 farmers gathered at the Woolshed to discuss the needs of the district with MPs Buxton & Jenkins.

A railway was seen as the prime need â€“ Hanson to Booborowie being preferred.

Mr Jenkins said the only thing preventing the construction was the cost due to the war and he expected that now it would fall.  He feared the move back to larger estates.

School accommodation was the next issue.

Presently the school was very unsatisfactory.  It was held in a church whose trustees have said it would not be available after Christmas unless decided steps were taken for a new school.  The members promised as much support as they could for a new school.
