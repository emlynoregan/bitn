Aberdeen Ballast Quarry.  Tenders are called by SAR for 2,000 tons of ballast, but they are due in by 30 September.  As the paper is not fully distributed till 29th September, how a person is expected to get a tender done is beyond us.  Is it that the Railways do not desire to receive local tenders?
