About 70 people attended the prefects’ induction in March.

The most urgent need for the school is improved playing grounds and the High School Council has been most supportive in plans to implement this.

The Department has offered £10 annually towards the use of the Town Oval.  In the year two fresh water tanks were installed and a new clothesline was erected.  154 steel chairs were obtained for the assembly hall.  A new Banda duplicating machine has been procured and linoleum was laid in the Needlework Room.  Anew lathe was obtained for the Woodwork Centre.  Most desks have been planed and varnished (and various other minor matters attended to.)

Six students gained Leaving Certificates and Trenna Eberhard & Merle Wickes won Commonwealth Scholarships.
