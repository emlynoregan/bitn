‘Erratic Correspondent’ turns his attention to the Waterworks.  In 1883 when the Record office burnt down there was no water at hand.  Several prominent ratepayers then agitated for a meeting of ratepayers to call for a water supply scheme.  The property owners, who were likely to require the water, turned up in force.  The then Town Clerk, F.W. Holder, pointed out that the Government had offered to construct a waterworks for the town costing £3,000 to £4,000 and to hand it all over to the Council which would take the revenue by paying 3% in the 1st year, 4% in the 2nd year and 5% p.a. thereafter on the capital.  With fuel and working expenses the total cost p.a. would be c. £400.  Against this certain ratepayers promised to take water to the value of £332 p.a.  The standpipe in Kooringa was expected to bring in £70 p.a. to make up the sum required.  M. Rayner of Aberdeen and Dr Brummitt supported what the Town Clerk said and gave the ratepayers to understand it was a great chance.  Dr Brummitt said: ‘if he thought the burden would fall upon persons who neither wanted nor used the water he would not advocate it’.  He was sure the revenue would increase.

Mr J.D. Cave supported the scheme too.  P. Lane supported it and thought they would be better off even if they had to pay more rates.

On 12 October 1883 196 voters with 508 votes (showing how property owners supported it) went to the polls.  111 individuals supported the scheme and 83 opposed.  In December Cr Brown moved the Government’s offer be accepted.  Cr Sampson was then the only opponent.
