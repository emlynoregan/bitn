John McLaren also writes defending what he said about letters to the press and the press generally.  What he was really intending was to express his disfavour of airing matters in the press before the Inspector or Councillors of the ward had neglected or refused to do so at the request of the ratepayer.  He also explains that, the Council having no other means of securing the creek north of the Bridge, he was behind the editorial, which Mr Morgan says secured the area for the town.
