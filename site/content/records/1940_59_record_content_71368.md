Mr Stanley Hawker recently asked in Parliament when the northern line was likely to see diesel trains.  The reply was that there was a delay in the arrival of diesel locomotives, which are allocated to lines on the basis of traffic density.  The Minister said he would enquire if the northern line qualified.  The Railway Commissioner has since said that consideration will be given to the use of the new type of railcar in the Adelaide-Terowie service.  At present a service is being run to Burra with a new railcar and trailer.

[The 250 Class railcars, known as ‘Bluebirds’ began service with two units in late 1954.  Three were added in 1955 and two more in 1956, three in 1957 and one in 1959.]
