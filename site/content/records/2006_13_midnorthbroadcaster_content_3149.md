The 16th Annual Antique Fair was held last weekend and hundreds of visitors came to Burra for the event.  [Photo.]

It coincided with the 10th Quilters Exhibition at the Burra Regional Art Gallery.

The Clare Concert Band played in Market Square, the Burra Markets operated at Burra North and the Golf Club Auction took place on the Aberdeen Oval.  For the young there were rides on the old Dennis Fire Engine.
