Kooringa News, 29 June

Obituary/Inquest.  Last Friday an inquest was held on the body of a shepherd, who died suddenly at the Smelters’ Home.  It appeared that the deceased was subject to heart disease and the jury returned a verdict of ‘died by the visitation of God’.

[The only registered death that would seem to match this description is that of John Leigh aged 45, who died at Burra Burra Mine 22 June 1859, residence World’s End.  The Smelters’ Home was on Part of Section 1, which was the Mine property.]

Bremer Mine, Callington.  The successful working of a 60 inch cylinder steam engine is reported.
