Adelaide Criminal Court, Friday.

Thomas Jones was tried for setting fire to grass in the Hundred of Apoinga on 28 January.  Evidence was given that Jones was seen to stoop and soon after a fire was seen.  Some 250 acres of grass was burnt and some fencing, while property worth £3,000 was endangered.  The prisoner denied his guilt and said ‘You can’t prove it, no one saw me do it.’

He was found guilty and sentenced to three years.
