Burra’s Anzac Service last Sunday attracted a large and reverent crowd to the War Memorial.  Returned men assembled at the RSL Club Rooms together with men of the 18/23 Light Horse under Lieutenants R. Shalders and H.S.T. Warnes.  The march was led by the Burra District Band under Bandmaster J.H. Murison.  Two Army Sisters were present: Mrs W. Pickering, who before her marriage was a British Army Service Nurse, and Mrs D. Keynes nee L. Armstrong.  Rev. D.L. Redding conducted the service, assisted by Rev. J.P.H. Tilbrook and Mr H. Fuss lay reader.  Rev. Tilbrook’s address is reported.  RSL President W.F. Pickering laid the first wreath.
