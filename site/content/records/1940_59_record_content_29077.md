Burra Cricket Association is appealing for funds to enable it to cover the cricket pitches at Victoria Park and Racecourse with malthoid.  This will eliminate the need for matting and save much time at matched and on practice nights.  The cost for both pitches will be c. £20.  The Victoria Park matting is worn and replacing it would cost £25.
