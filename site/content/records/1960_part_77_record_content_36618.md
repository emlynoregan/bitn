Burra Effluent Drainage Scheme

At a meeting in the Town Hall on 2 October Health Department officers gave an illustrated account of a drainage scheme to dispose of waste water.  Messrs Wilson & Smith were representatives at the well-attended meeting.  The first such scheme had been a success at Pinnaroo, after which they had been installed at places like Berri, Maitland, Nuriootpa and Barmera.  There are thirty more towns at present ready to go ahead with schemes.  Rates applicable to cover the original cost are less than the Government sewerage rate.  Costs vary from town to town due to varying soils, underground water, rock types, etc.  The Central Board of Health will design a scheme; prepare plans, specifications and estimates at no cost to the Council or ratepayers.  For Burra they have prepared a scheme designed to cover the business area from the old Post Office to the Hospital, with a capacity for fifty homes or buildings on the south side of Commercial Street.  The drain would run from the treatment area at the rear of the Bowling Green, up the lane behind the Post Office, through the lane by the Police Station to Chapel Street, along behind the Commercial Hotel and Hurley’s Road House to Kangaroo Street to the Hospital septic system on the north side of Commercial Street.  A connection from Chapel Street to the front of Bence’s premises would then run as far as Dr Miller’s in one direction and to the old Post Office in the other.  The treatment portion near the Bowling Green would comprise a biological filter and pond.  There would be no odour from the pond.  There are already two small biological filters in Burra; one on the creek side of the old Post Office and the other near the Red Bridge behind the Burra Motor Co.’s premises.  The stone in the filters lasted a long time – one at Glenelg had not been renewed in 30 years.  Mr Topsfield asked about the possibility of a double pond system to take raw sewage.  Mr Wilson said this was not recommended because it would cost three times as much.  In the unit under consideration it would be necessary to have septic treatment on the individual properties before connection to the main drainage.  It could handle laundry, kitchen and ordinary waste water without prior treatment – but would not handle storm water.  The cost was estimated at $12,000.  This would be a cost of $200 per premises for the initial scheme, which could be extended to the rest of the town later.  It was intended to site the drain under the footpaths.  Council would have to repair or replace the footpaths involved.  It would generally be about four feet from foundations and about four feet deep.

Mr Jacka moved a recommendation the system be enlarged for the whole town and the original treatment tank site be used as a pumping point with a larger oxidation pond further down the creek.  Seconded by Mr Topsfield.  It was pointed out that the extra surveys etc. would delay the scheme by three or four years.  The recommendation was withdrawn on the request of the Chairman E.T. Baulderstone and replaced by a suggestion that the proposed limited scheme be implemented, but the disposal unit be further downstream with a pump behind the Burra Bowling Green and the oxidation pond be large enough to take on the whole town drainage at a later time.  On E.T. Baulderstone’s request this was also withdrawn in the interests of not delaying the project.  After discussion L. Bence moved a recommendation be made to the Local Board of Health that the scheme as presented be adopted subject to the Central Board investigating the possibility of installing a pump in lieu of the biological filter and determining the availability of land at reasonable cost to install an oxidation pond which would eventually take the effluent from the whole town.  This was seconded by Dr Miller.

[Presumably this was carried, though it is not so reported.]
