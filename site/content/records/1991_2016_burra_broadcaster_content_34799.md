Burra Leisure Activity Group held a garden party on 13 October to thank its volunteers.  Thirty-five volunteers and customers attended.  The group has 23 volunteers, ranging from some very dedicated, who work 6-12 hours a week, to others who assist with food, fundraising, cleaning, gardening, driving, etc.  3,642 volunteer hours have been recorded for 12 months.  Three people have volunteered for 25 years: Meryl White, Olive Oates and Gordon Wooton.  Meryl White has reduced her hours from 18 a week to 12, as her health declined in her 80s.  Olive Oates has been the music supremo.  Gordon Wooton has worked behind the scenes, taking the brunt of Marleneâ€™s themed adventures and working with fundraising and driving.
