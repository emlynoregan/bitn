Burra Burra DC has increased its rates by an overall 11.5%.  Burra Town residents will face an increase of 24%, while rural rates rise by 7.57%.  Booborowie & Mt Bryan rates rise 9.9% and those in Farrell Flat by 8.25%.  Burra District Clerk said the increases were due to ever increasing fixed operating costs.  Council had allocated $100,000 for Market Square development and half of that came from the Jubilee 150 Road Assets Program.  Plans had yet to be finalised for the pedestrian mall, new car parking arrangements and safer traffic control.  $120,000 was allocated for local road maintenance.
