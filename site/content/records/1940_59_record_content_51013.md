At the declaration of the poll on Saturday, E.R. Davey chastised North Ward ratepayers for wasting money.  Firstly no one nominated and then when a further call was made two nominated, of whom one took little interest in campaigning.  Staging the election cost Â£32 and only 70 voters turned out.  The result was:

Les. White	63

H.C. Davies	7

The cost to ratepayers was 9/- per vote.  Ex-Councillor had previously been appointed to his term for North Ward when no one signified his willingness to come forward.
