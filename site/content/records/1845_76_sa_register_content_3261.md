George Hogg writes of the subject of the George Stevenson libel case, pouring scorn on someone taking an action against another for calling him ‘honest’. 

‘Teamster’, writes 25 November 1848.

[The opening four paragraphs assert the importance of a free press and contend that the freedom of the press is under attack in SA from the actions of a body of rich capitalists.  He then goes on the say that the origin of the row lies in the antagonism of capital to labour.]

‘…the richest mine in the world refusing to give a sufficient wage, a sufficiency of bread, meat and clothes for the labour, that makes the mine-holders rich beyond all belief, and overbearing beyond all precedent.  That is the root of the enmity: and because the Register, with boldness and honesty, has taken up the cudgels for the poor teamster and miner, and other wealth-makers, it is to be put hors de combat by law, or through the expense of law; that is the birdseye view of the question.’

Who are the parties to this antagonism?  ‘…the Burra aristocracy on the one hand and the wealth makers, or working men, on the other.’

‘What! Is the shaft of the column to scorn the foundation on which it is reared?’

[He continues for some time in this vein with Biblical as well as contemporary allusions.  His next point is that it was to escape the bondage and serfdom that kept workers down in Europe, that they came to this new colony.  ]

‘Leave your shaft in the mine, your team on the road, your bench and your workshop, the cow’s tail and the plough’s tail, and if you would rejoice in the victory, come to the battle.’

‘If you are indifferent to the fate of your press, and careless of the results of the question at this time, I. at least, will never again put lance in rest for you.  If you give the present opportunity the go-by, then go, submit to your taskmasters in peace; go, make bricks without straw; crave humbly for employment.

“with bated breath and whispering humbleness

Suing in a bondsman’s key.”’

[He concludes by stating that his truthfulness has pierced them to the core and if the Directors should by some necromancy emerge triumphant he will pursue their name so that it live on in infamy and the very absurdity of their action shall save their names from oblivion.]
