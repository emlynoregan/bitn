A Rodeo Exhibition at Wayville recently attracted Australia-wide interest.  Six sons of Mr & Mrs Walter Finch of Leighton took part: Reg, Ken, Jack, Ron, Aubrey & Spencer.  Spencer (11) won the open steer riding competition from 52 competitors and got Â£12-12-0, a silver cup and a ribbon.  Ken was leading in the best rider competition, but was disqualified for not dismounting immediately on the bell.
