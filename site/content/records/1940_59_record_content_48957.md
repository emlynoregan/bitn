Fires.  A proposal to limit steam trains operations in hot weather has been put forward by G.S. Hawker MP and endorsed by Councillors.  Suggested changes are:

The daytime steam train Monday, Thursday & Friday from Adelaide to Terowie be replaced by a motor train [railcar] from Adelaide to Burra.

A steam train run at about Broken Hill Express time on Tuesday and Thursday from Adelaide to Terowie.

A steam train run at about Broken Hill Express time Wednesday and Friday from Terowie to Adelaide.

This would give one up and one down train each day between Adelaide and Terowie and yet keep trains off the route in the hottest part of the day.
