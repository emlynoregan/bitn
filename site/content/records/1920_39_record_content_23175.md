Burra Golf Club.  The enlargement of the links to 18 holes was opened when Dr Steven, Vice-President, in the absence of the President Dr Steele, asked ‘Mr [sic] Maurice Collins to open the new links by driving off the first ball.  Mrs Collins drove off, a very neat low drive for which she was loudly applauded.’  All that is needed now is a club house.
