Burra Hospital Board meeting of 16 October

The foundation stone of the new Nurses’ Home was laid by the Premier.

A prize of £5-5-0 is offered for the best garden design for the hospital (up to 19 November.)  Designs are on display in Mr Baulderstone’s window.

Progress has been made on ploughing and seeding the hospital paddock.

A statement of variations shows the present state of the building contract to be £22,920.

A quote of £588-19-0 for heating the new block relaces an estimate of £700.

Sisters L. Leedham and P. Bauer have resigned.

Sister Bartholomaeus began on 13 October and Nurses Davies and Houston began on 5 & 13 October respectively.
