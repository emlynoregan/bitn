Burra Town Council, 2 August. [sic] [Since the paper of 10 August reports a meeting on the 6 August this is probably a misprint for 20 August.]

Guarantees for water worth £74 in Kooringa and £150 in Aberdeen and Redruth have been obtained.  A further effort will be made because if the government’s offer is rejected it is felt unlikely it will be repeated any time soon.  The sum required annually is £400

Quarry St to East St and East St are to be formed.
