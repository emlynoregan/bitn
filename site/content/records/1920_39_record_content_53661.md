T.H. Woollacott wrote a reply to A.L. Bence’s letter.

[Woollacott’s letter is incoherent in places, with poorly constructed sentences and blustering rudeness, but his main line of argument is clear.  Part of the problem seems to have arisen from the newspaper report, which was written in such a way as to make some of Bence’s apparently incorrect conclusions logical assumptions based on what the paper said.]

Mr Woollacott makes the following points:

Mr Bence says he is speaking for other business people as well as himself, but I have been assured by many that he spoke for himself.

There is no Mayor’s Fund for the relief of unemployment.

I have not in four years in office appealed to Mr Bence or anyone else for clothes or money to help distress in the town caused by unemployment.

I challenge you to say when and where I have done the round of the shops for the unemployed and sent money to the city for clothes or for anything else.

Not a penny of the public money collected in the town has ever been spent in the city or even sent to Melbourne.

A few months ago £50 was sent from the city (AOF) and Mr Bence had his share with every other businessman in the town.

Your correspondent will no doubt be surprised to learn the town has just received and spent £300 for unemployment relief: all spent in the town coming from the same source as the clothes -  [sic: I cannot clarify this further.]

‘I might say during the Premier’s visit on disabilities of the town what it cost the Mayor to entertain the first citizen of the State and mainly due to the Mayor’s effort and Council’s support’.

I have been well paid for my effort by receiving from the Government the sum of £300 for the unemployed.

As to the few clothes about which so much has been written the facts are the Government made available to the URC a limited amount of money for the purchase of boots, clothes etc.  The Mayor of every town is asked to co-operate and assist the URC in the distribution, and control in their areas, the amount allotted to Burra is under £20, to work for clothes, and not cash and a schedule is sent for sizes, articles, values etc.  Each applicant sends in his or her requirements which are everyday requirements and after completion the list is sent to the URC.  The clothes are forwarded to the Mayor under the conditions, and are worked out under the basic wage.

The men and their wives are delighted with their goods, first quality and no misfits and had I refused to assist, the men would have been the worse off and it makes no difference to the business people as those receiving would not be in a position to buy.

The report of the delegate given in the Council Chamber is not Cr Kellaway’s suggestion.  It was like many other things talked of at the conference.  The remark that money is sent to the city is not true and neither my policy public or private.

[Mr Woollacott then calls on Mr Bence to substantiate his claims or apologise. In the process he accuses Mr Bence of stupidity and says it is not his (Woollacott’s) role to criticise Government policy and might be thought to imply that it is not Bence’s either.  His anger leads Woollacott into being rather insulting.  It is easy to see how Mr Bence got some of his ideas.  The paper certainly speaks of a Mayor’s Fund and at least implies that the Mayor sent money to Adelaide when it says the Mayor ordered £16 worth from the city.]
