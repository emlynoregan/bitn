Sir Douglas Mawson passed through the town last Thursday.  He has been with a party criss-crossing the eastern country and stopped for pies at Mr Kuchenmeister’s while the hood of one of the cars was repaired.  He said he had made many interesting finds to the east, but not of an economic nature.  He asked where the local Vanadium Mine was and no one could tell him.  He said it was found at Burra in a form found nowhere else and as such specimens would be valuable.  It is said to be located in section 1 Hd of Apoinga.  He also wished to inspect one of the old copper prospects at World’s End in the hope of finding interesting fossils.
