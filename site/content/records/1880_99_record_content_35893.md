Sporting News.

Two women in Melbourne in dispute decided to settle the matter in a prize fight.  Etty Dickens and Elizabeth Fry met at Smith’s Swamp (locally known as Jerusalem Square) 300-400 larrikins and disreputable girls attended.  Etty stripped to the waist, Elizabeth merely took off her ulster.  20 rounds ensued and Fry had the best of it before police arrived and the girls were charged.  They were fined 20/- or 48 hours.

Proposed rules for wrestling in Australia are printed.

Skating is popular at present.  At Broken Hill Cotter beat the SA champion, Scott, in a race over 10 miles for £20.  The distance was covered in 43 minutes.
