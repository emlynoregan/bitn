Burra Hospital Auxiliary with help from the Burra Hospital Community recently enabled the purchase of a mobile Vital Signs Machine after a successful year of fundraising.  This year the Melbourne Cup Luncheon moved to the Bowling Club, which saw the deferral of the Saltbush Fashion Parade.  Thanks go to Helen Dunow for compering the event.  Helen has now moved from the area.  The Burra Quiltersâ€™ Group donated a quilt for raffling, which raised $1187.15.  The Burra Uniting Church Op Shop made a donation of $500.  The project for 2011-12 is the rejuvenation of the palliative care suite.  Special thanks go to Treasurer Murray Tiver and President Chris Harris.
