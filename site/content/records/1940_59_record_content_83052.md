The Burra Show was opened by G. Stanley Hawker.  Wet and windy conditions on Saturday morning caused a fall in attendance figures.  The afternoon was sunny.   [Mr Hawker’s speech is printed.]

The Rural Youth display in the pavilion at least equalled that of previous years.  Burra Rural Youth organised a very successful and enjoyable Gala Night Dance with nett proceeds of c. £32.

The school displays were again commendable.

[The report in the paper is more limited than in the past.  Major prize winners are named and then other prize winners are listed without details of what they were given prizes for.  This continues a practice from 1957.]

Some special mentions:

Photography: Best transparency to Rex Warnes.

Birds: Duck, Geese and Poultry entries were down and so was quality.  Champion Bird to R.J. Palmer.

Pigeons.  A good display.  Champion bird to J.L. Oehme & Champion Fancy Pigeon to Jungfer Bros.

Champion Budgerigar to D.L. Storer.

Aggregate prize in cooking to Mrs F.C. Stolte.

Champion Jersey Bull to M.C. Garrard.

A. Tennant won the McBride Cup for Truest to Breed.

E. Finch was the main winner in Fruit.

In Flowers Iceland poppies and marigolds were particularly noted.

Champion pansy went to Mrs Wilf Nankivell.
