Obituary.  The remains of Mr Templer, the founder of that well known hostelry nine miles north of Gawler, were interred at Gawler Cemetery on Thursday.  His remains were met at Willaston by the Masonic body (Lodge of Felicity) of Gawler, of which he was an old and respected member.  Each member was in full regalia and bore a sprig of remembrance.  (In the northern counties of England this is a sprig of rosemary, but in many parts of Europe, as in Australia, Freemasons use the acacia.)  The lodge members accompanied the body to St George’s Church and thence to the cemetery.
