Kooringa News, 2 May

Some talk has occurred recently about the formation of a District Council or a Corporation.  Opinions for and against have been expressed.  All agree that either one or the other should exist.  In Kooringa many who hold their land on short leases object to paying rates to improve the value of dwellings belonging to the mine.

It has been proposed to present a memorial to the Directors that the new company, when formed, should have the power to sell the freehold to the properties in Kooringa, while reserving mineral rights.  If they did this more substantial houses would soon appear.  Should freehold be granted there would be no difficulty in forming a Corporation and this would then be able to see to the removal of the disgusting outhouses now so prominent and to see to the enforcement of sanitary rules.

Weather.  On Monday there was a dust cloud extending high into the atmosphere and obscuring the sun.  A fall of rain was anticipated, but fine weather set in without a thunderstorm.

The Primitive Methodist church held their Anniversary Services at Redruth early this week.  Rev. J.G. Wright officiated.

The Smelting Works has resumed operations with four furnaces alight.
