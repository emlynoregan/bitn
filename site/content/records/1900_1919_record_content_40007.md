War Matters

Hartley Harris is in camp as one of the 165 out of 1,200 picked to act as reserves for the 1st Expeditionary Force.

R.H. Woollacott [actually R.J.] writes from England that instead of coming home he is volunteering.  He is presently at Windsor and will soon go to the front.  In his letter he writes: ‘we must all . . . be prepared to make sacrifices to assist them [the younger men] in carrying this out’.
