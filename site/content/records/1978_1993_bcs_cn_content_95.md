17 August 1978

The Annual School Ball will be held this Friday 18 august in the School’s Aberdeen Hall.

The music will be supplied by the local Stimulus Band and the format will be 50/50.

A District Advisory Committee has been formed, with its first meeting tonight.  Mr Ray Jennison will chair the proceedings until officers are elected.  The aims of the body are:

To maintain an overview of community needs.

To analyse such needs through discussion, study and survey.

To provide a forum for the discussion of ideas.

To suggest ways that organisations can take actions separately or collectively.

To sponsor actions themselves when they are too large for individual organisations.

To serve as a clearing house for dates and information about services and voluntary activities.

To liaise closely with the Burra Burra DC on community needs and opinions.

A list of participating people is printed.

Notice.  A Public Forum on Investment Opportunities will be offered in the Burra Community Library at 8 p.m. with speakers from the Adelaide Stock Exchange.

Primary School Carnival last Friday saw the Primary Football team win the day.  Burra I 4.3 defeated Jamestown 1.1.

In Netball Burra Team 1 won the Grand Final in ‘A’ Division and Team 4 came second in the ‘B’ Division.
