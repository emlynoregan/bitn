Burra Heritage Grant Re-allocated

The Burra Burra DC has sent a telegram to the Federal Minister of Sport & Recreation, Mr John Brown, asking him to investigate the rumour that $210,000 of Burra’s Jubilee 150 grant has been re-allocated.  District Clerk Mr Alan Dwyer said the Council was seeking an investigation into the activities of the Heritage Conservation Branch of the Department of Environment and Planning and of the Jubilee 150 Board before the money was re-allocated.  The Council considers the re-allocation unacceptable and unfair.  Federal MP for Wakefield Mr Neil Andrew and the State member for Eyre were both following the matter up, but it is believed that the Premier Mr Bannon would not oppose the re-allocation.  It is believed the money has been re-allocated to the Port Adelaide Maritime Museum because that project had run over budget.  Mr Dwyer pointed out the coincidence that there is an Independent Labor candidate running against the sitting Labor member in Port Adelaide.  Burra heritage projects had been allocated $470,000 and its spending had been decided by the Jubilee 150 Board and the steering committee of the Burra Council.  $150,000 had been spent on Paxton Cottages and $30,000 was being spent on the Bon Accord site.  The remainder was to have been spent on Morphett’s pumphouse and a Copper Interpretive Centre.  Mr Dwyer said the delay in spending the grant was due to a number of factors including the interference by the Heritage Conservation Branch of the Department of Environment and planning, which had refused to allow construction of the centre on the site of the old boiler house adjacent to Morphett’s pumphouse.   The manager of the Heritage Conservation Branch Mr John Womersley said the new building would be inappropriate to the character of the pumphouse and is believed to have recommended the re-allocation of the grant money.  The District Clerk said the Council had originally bought the old Salvation Army Citadel to house the interpretative centre, but the Heritage Conservation Branch had rejected that as not having either the right social atmosphere or the rite site.  The Council then proposed the Bon Accord Mine site, but this in turn was rejected as being the ‘back door’ of the mine area.  Finally a site some 200 m from Morphett’s Pumphouse was approved, but after an architect had prepared plans it was found that site would double the costs allocated for the project.  The architect was sacked and a new proposal for a smaller building on the old boiler house site was submitted to the Jubilee 150 Board on 21 August.  They rejected it.
