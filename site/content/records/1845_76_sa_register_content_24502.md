The Burra Mine.  Although there is no likelihood of the SA Mining Association regaining its former importance, the last half-yearly report shows it is not yet entirely played out.  There are yet in the mine thousands of tons of cupreous ore, which if not as rich as in former days is yet payable.  There is still work for scores of men for years to come.  The shareholders will not again be richly rewarded, but their expenditure will not be entirely unproductive.  An increased yield of ore has been reported for the half-year and this, with the rise in the copper price, discloses a more cheerful prospect than for many previous half-years.  On 30 September 1871 the quantity of ore on hand was 95 tons, but this has been augmented by nearly 679 tons to 774 tons.  502 tons have been sold the E & A Copper Co. (which has recently resumed the payment of dividends).  Despite some problems with the drawing chains, 21,797 loads or 27,246 tons have been hauled out of the main pit.  There are two main cuttings from which stuff is being taken.  One is 88 fathoms in length from the foot of the incline and has not yielded any large quantity of ore.  The western cutting extends to a length of 77 fathoms and is proving more productive.  The new dressing machine has not been without its problems.  A stoppage took place in December for repairs, and it has not yet resumed duty.  A few pitches have been let to tributers, but most work is being done by men directly employed by the company.  The great flood down the Burra Creek on 16 January carried away so much orey sand that the erection of machinery designed to treat that stuff was suspended.  Arrangements have been entered into for the removal of certain deposits of sand of good quality.   The balance sheet does not reveal a particularly prosperous company, but assets more than cover liabilities.  The report says ‘the prospects of the mine are more encouraging than they have been for some years,’ and ‘there is good reason to hope that the undertaking will shortly prove remunerative.’
