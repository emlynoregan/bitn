The 1968 Show was opened by Mr E.C. Allen MP, Member for Burra.  The 2527 entries were just below the previous year’s record.  With 500 entries in the Horses-in-Action, the event ran throughout the day.  The Hack Section was among the best in the state.  Sheep entries were down, but quality was very good.  The wool display was good, but considering Burra’s position as the centre of a major wool district, it could be larger.  Industrial sites were filled and included a light aircraft display from Air Mist.  The agricultural pavilion had a good display of fruit, vegetable, needlework, grain and fodder, but lacked support in art and cooking sections.  The Rural Youth display was the same as was entered for the Royal Adelaide Show, and was of a very high standard.  Poultry and birds were well represented and although flowers and floral art entries were down by nearly half, the exhibits were up to the usual high standards.  Sideshows were very numerous and of greater variety than in previous years.  Thanks, of course, go to the convenors, stewards, judges and exhibitors and especially to our new secretary, Miss Judy Beinke.
