Rev. W.F. James writes a long letter explaining his disappointment at the withdrawal of J.E.H. Winnall from the stone laying at Jubilee Hall, and a shorter one from J.E.H. Winnall on the same subject.  Mr Winnall had agreed initially on the understanding he was acting in a personal manner and felt he was unable to take part as a representative of the Anglican Church.
