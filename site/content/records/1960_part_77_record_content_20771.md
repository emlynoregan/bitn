Accident.  A semi-trailer rolled onto its side in Market Square on Sunday when its load shifted.  The driver Mr J.L. Carroll of Prospect did a good job in managing to avoid the War Memorial when the load of pre-fabricated huts, destined for Moree in NSW, shifted as he turned from Commercial Street into Market Square heading north.  The driver was not injured.  Numerous people took photos. A crane arrived from Adelaide on Monday morning to unload the vehicle and right it.  The vehicle was driven off once it regained its wheels with damage of only £30-£40.  Damage to the huts was also slight and it is thought that spectators damaged more roses than the accident itself.  Alan Baulderstone removed a dozen or more to save them and 19 of the 48 are still standing.
