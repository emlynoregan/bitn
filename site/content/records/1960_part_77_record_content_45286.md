Burra Corporation Ceases to Exist

From 25 April 1969 the Burra Corporation has amalgamated with the District Council.  The last meeting of the Burra Town Council was held on Monday 21 April and ended at 12.45 a.m. on Tuesday 22 April.  The Town Council had existed for almost 93 years, with its first meeting being on 10 July 1876.  It had been established by a proclamation of the Governor on 28 June 1876 and published in the SA Government Gazette of Thursday 29 June 1876.  This established a Council with Philip Lane as the first Mayor with six Councillors:

North Ward	George Sara & August Bartholomaeus

Middle Ward	Robert Saunders [Sanders] & Edward Lipsett

South Ward	Joseph Roberts & John Snell

The last Mayor Mr E.T. Baulderstone served on the Council for 23 years, the last 15 as Mayor.  He has seen the service of eight Town Clerks, several of whom had no previous local experience, which did not help to make Mr Baulderstone’s term an easy one.  The old Corporation comprised an area of 3,015 acres with some 53 miles of roads.  The existing Town Councillors will see out the final two months of the term they were elected for, as members of the amalgamated body, except for Councillors Moreland and Kotz, who, as employees of the District Council, are not permitted to serve as Councillors.  At the last meeting of the Local Board of Health for the Corporation Dr L.G. Miller was thanked for his services to the Board.

The District Council of Burra Burra was formed in 1935 as a result of the amalgamation of the District Councils of Hanson, Mt Bryan, Burra and [part of] Booborowie.  The new Council will encompass an area of 800 square miles with over 1,100 miles of road.  The new Council will meet for the first time on 14 May.  Councillors are:

Chairman G.R. Finch

E.T. Baulderstone	S.T. Miller

B.A. Riggs	J. Burge

R. White	M.T. Kellock

W.H. Quinn	H. Quinn

R.B. Jennison	C.L. Phillips

R.E. Angel	R.J. Jeffery

District Clerk is T.G. Perry.

Because the first meeting of the new Council will be on 14 May this year’s call for nominations for Councillors has been delayed.  They will be called at this meeting with nominations to close 30 May.
