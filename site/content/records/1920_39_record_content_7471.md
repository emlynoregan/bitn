Burra Town Council, 3 April.

William McBride was granted permission to build a house in Aberdeen.

W. J. McDonald, Manager of the SAFU, wrote drawing attention to the dangerous traffic conditions at the corner of his store and urging a 10 m.p.h. limit from the corner of Thames St to Morgan’s bakery.  Police attention is to be drawn to the danger.

Angas E. Marr wrote enclosing a detailed estimate of the cost of installing an electric light scheme in Burra.  Information will be sought from other towns.

Two tenders to build a Fire Station were rejected as too dear.
