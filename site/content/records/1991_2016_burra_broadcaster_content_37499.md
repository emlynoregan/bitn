The Burra Hospital Auxiliary has spent $50,000 on equipment for the hospital in the last six years.  The hospital is now fully equipped with electric beds – thanks to the Lucas Family of Booborowie, who started by donating the first of them and agreeing to donate another for every three financed by another organisation.  The public is urged to support the Auxiliary’s Melbourne Cup Luncheon to enable their work to continue.
