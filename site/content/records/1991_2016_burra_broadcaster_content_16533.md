Possible credit Union

Mid North Regional Development Board is talking with a major credit union, which apparently is keen to set up a regional facility in Clare, with a sub-branch at Burra, with possible later branches at Eudunda and Balaklava.  The Goyder Credit Union Working Party has handed over its brief to the MNRDB.  Talks are continuing.
