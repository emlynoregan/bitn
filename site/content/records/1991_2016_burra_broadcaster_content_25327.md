BRTBA held its AGM last week and President Sue Ryan summarised a successful year, though she cautioned members not to overwork volunteers, but to encourage spreading the load over greater membership.  Over the past year the association had become more of an umbrella organisation, operating through a number of sub-committees.  There are such committees to deal with:	The Antique Fair

The Burra Biathlon
