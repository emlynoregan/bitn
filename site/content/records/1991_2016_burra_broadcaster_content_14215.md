Redfire Resources – Annual Report

Entered a joint venture agreement to cover the tenement covering the Mongolata Goldfield area.

Identified two target areas within 5 km of Burra.

Burra Copper Mine produced 2.7 million tons of ore [in the 1970s] averaging 3% copper, up to its closure in 1981 and copper occurrences are present north and south of the historic mine.

Mongolata has a series of gold workings along a 12 km zone and was actively worked in the 1930s.  Targets to the east under alluvium have been identified by recent government aerial magnetic surveys.

Tooralie lies on the eastern boundary of the company’s tenements and covers an area greater than 1000 km 2.  Recent mapping and magnetic data indicate the area is highly prospective for gold and base metal deposits.
