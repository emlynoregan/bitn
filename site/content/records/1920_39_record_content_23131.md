Mr Radford then changed his former ruling, but by then some Kooringa members were engaged to play at Robertstown and others to go to Adelaide and so Kooringa suggested 23 & 25 April.

Mt Bryan objected to this as seeding operations would be in progress and they wanted 9 & 23 as before.

Kooringa replied that seeding operations appeared only to affect two players, neither of them prominent and Kooringa said they were not able to play on 9 April, despite which Mt Bryan travelled to Aberdeen and back again on that date and then wrote a letter complaining of the non-appearance of Kooringa and asking for this to be dealt with under Section IX of the Constitution – considering the match as forfeited.

The Kooringa Club accepts the Chairman’s rulings absolutely.

‘In our private views and in those of most cricketers technicalities and fine points in rules are not good cricket.  The Mt Bryan Club therefore has the great honour of retaining the premiership on a forced forfeit, after having been very soundly and decisively beaten in the final game.’

W.M. Bednall, Captain of the Kooringa Cricket Club
