Over 250 descendants of James Tiver came to Burra Town Hall for a reunion on Sunday to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the arrival of James Tiver in Burra.  There was a brief thanksgiving service and a group photograph as well as the expected speeches etc.  Then the James Tiver Walk of Fame plaque was unveiled.

James Tiver of Bristol was one of four children born to Hugh Tiver and Rebecca nee Godwin.  He had little schooling and went to work when aged about 8.  He and his brother Charles learnt the trade of mason, though their father was a baker.  James married Elizabeth South and had a son James Hugh, born at Newport and the young family sailed from Plymouth in the barque David Malcolm, arriving at Port Adelaide 30 April 1855.  They were met by an uncle, James Rosser.  A daughter Margaret Malcolm was born on the voyage.  They came to Burra by bullock dray and put up a two-roomed wattle and daub hut near the ford [now a bridge] in Young Street.  Elizabeth died of tuberculosis [29 November 1856] and James later [7 February 1858] married Emma Price, who had come from Plymouth in the Alloquis in 1856.  James built the middle house on the row [on the north side of Truro Street] in Redruth and most of the ten children of his second family were born there.  With Emma’s help he added houses either side of the first to make a row now known as Tiver’s Row.  He did contract work for the Burra Mine for about two years and carrying business between Pt Adelaide and Burra.  In 1870 he built the house and store in Aberdeen where the family then lived.
