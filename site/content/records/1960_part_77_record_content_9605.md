Burra Town Council, 2 January

A petition forwarded by S.J. Woollacott asked the Council to move without delay to seek an amalgamation with the Burra Burra DC.  A move to have a combined meeting with the District Council on the matter was carried on the casting vote of the Mayor.

It was resolved that the Caravan Park become a camping site only.

The resignation of the Town Clerk was accepted with regret.
