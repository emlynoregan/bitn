The architect Keith Shaw talked with the Committee and the builders Messrs C. Parker, Bill Robinson, Len Taylor and Bert Cornelius.

By the end of 1956 £800 had been raised for the pool.

In the first three months of 1957 considerable preparatory ground work was done.  The annual meeting in March 1957 saw the fund at £817 and the principal officers were re-elected.

On 2 June 1957 sixty-five men at a working bee gave 312 man-hours of work worth £120.  The first section of the floor was laid.  The second section followed a fortnight later, having been delayed by rain.  The final section was laid on 7 July.

In August 1957 the fund reached £1,007.  A further application for a Government grant of £1,500 was made.  The walls were poured by the end of November and the setting up of the concrete surrounds began.  In February 1958 the walls and floor were sealed.  The pool was slowly filled beginning on 7 February 1958.  The pool was next fenced.  Rural Youth contributed 146 hours of labour in June 1958.  A toddlers’ pool was planned.  Retaining wall and work on planting the slopes etc. followed.  In November 1958 £500 was urgently needed for dressing sheds, kiosk etc. which were estimated to cost £900 to £1,000.  This meant £500 had to be raised to qualify for a £500 subsidy.  Quite quickly a variety of means raised about £270 and foundations were poured and bricks obtained.

[The wading pool was completed on 10 August 1959] On 7 December a working bee painted the wading pool and donations reached over £500.  At the end of the school year in 1958 Mr R.G. Jeffery was transferred to Cleve.

[Although there were no changing rooms at this time] the pool was available for the Education Department’s Learn to Swim Campaign from 5 to 16 January 1959.  154 children enrolled and 100 gained certificates. The instructors were Messrs Tom Bowden & Grenville Ireland.  Check the timeline in 1958-59.  In this report it gets rather jumbled.  THIS CAN ONLY BE DONE WHEN 1959 HAS BEEN NOTED.

On 22 January 1959 it was decided to appoint a caretaker and to postpone the official opening till the following season when the pool would really be completed.

Lighting for evening sessions was discussed with Electricity Trust Officers and Mr Bert Beinke was enlisted to install it.  The committee was then led by H.J. Topsfield as President and E. Orchard as Secretary.

A working bee called for 24 November 1959 was disappointing and the pool could not be re-opened as early as had been hoped.  On 30 November 1959 it was re-opened after an energetic band had worked painting the outside of the dressing sheds and doing other necessary jobs.  The remaining major job is the installation of electric light and refrigeration to satisfy the demand for cold drinks.

In February 1959 the first Swimming Carnival was held in the new pool.  It was won by Draysey House.

In January 1960 the Education Department’s Learn to Swim Campaign saw 112 school children gain 204 certificates.  Instructors were Mr L. Pemberton & Miss Judy Kellock.

Prior to the opening floodlights were erected for night swimming and they did an excellent job, though one more on the eastern side will be required when finance permits.
