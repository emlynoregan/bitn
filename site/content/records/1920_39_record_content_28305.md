The Tubercular Soldiers’ Aid Society Concert on Friday drew a full house.  The concert was 1¾ hours late due to engine trouble at Gawler.  (They left at 4.30 p.m. which was scarcely enough time without delays – the bitumen extends 40 miles towards Burra.  Various locals filled the gap with songs etc.  The concert was excellent.
