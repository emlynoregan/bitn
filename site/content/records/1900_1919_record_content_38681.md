Burra Town Council, 3 August.

The Town Clerk reported that the Smelts walls had been put in order.

SA Railways will attend to the crossing near the ballast quarry.

The mayor says the SAR has encroached 15 yards on the road near the station and had done so for years, but it was dangerous.  The Commissioner will be asked to shift the fence.

Cr Wicklein said that if they struck a lighting rate they could retain the 75% system of dividing the general rate between the Wards.

The Bishop’s offer of £10 for a piece of land outside the cemetery was refused.
