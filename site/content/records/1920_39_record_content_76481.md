Burra Bowling Club held its AGM and elected: Patron, Dr D.M. Steele; President, F.T. Sara; Vice-Presidents, G.E. Dane & S. Kellaway and Secretary & Treasurer, J.T. Pascoe.

Financially the club’s position improved.  The year began with a credit of £1-11-2 and ended in credit £16-13-10, due to increased membership, which was the highest since 1931 with 36 full members, 2 Sunday members and 4 night members.  Inter-club results were not good.  Though Burra retained the Burra-Kapunda Cup the shield was lost to Clare and Burra won only 3 of the 8 matches played.  S. Kellaway was congratulated on winning the Club Championship.
