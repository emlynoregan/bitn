Burra High School

On Sunday 11 December the school’s Valedictory Service at St Mary’s saw about 300 present from the Anglican and Methodist families of the school.  The service was inaugurated last year to mark the end of Religious Instruction for the year.  Rev. A. Baxter of Clare was to have been the guest preacher, but he collapsed that morning and instead Rev. Blades of Riverton stepped in at short notice.  A social hour followed in the RSL Hall where about 150 people were entertained by Robin, David and Jenny Jarman of Adelaide who delighted with their music.
