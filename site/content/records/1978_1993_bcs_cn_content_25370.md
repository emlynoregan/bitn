Pattama Iemsuwan  (Exchange teacher from Thailand.)

I come from the northeast of Thailand at Loei, with a population of c. 500,000 where I work as an English language teacher.  I have been teaching English for 13 years in a co-educational secondary school with 2,364 students and 168 teachers.  I am married to a government official who works at the governor’s secretary’s office.
