West Burra Copper Mine: Sixth half-yearly report to shareholders.  G. Lord presided.

No large ore body has yet been found, but 8½ tons of high-grade ore were raised and sent to Pt Adelaide.  The financial position was not strong and there was a need to raise 10-20 tons.  In the six months just gone a winze has been sunk from the 100’ to water level, c. 46’ at a cost of £92.  A rise from the 50’ level to the surface cost £47 and 56’ of driving and crosscutting cost £79.  The 8½ tons despatched cost £61-7-0 to mine and forward, for a return of £200.  Working costs have been £317.  Presently the sinking has been 246’, driving and crosscutting 529’ and rising 47’.  We believe further development is justified at the bottom of the winze.  Funds can be obtained from work at the 50’ level.  We began with a credit of £360-9-6 and end in credit £54-10-9.

S.M. Lane and C.B. Warnes were re-elected as directors.  The directors were instructed to take out as much ore as possible in the light of the high price of copper.
