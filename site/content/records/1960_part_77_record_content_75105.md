Football.  The umpiring section of the SANFL has advised that ‘A’ Grade umpires will no longer officiate at ‘Double-Headers’.  Umpires for Senior and Junior Colts will not be supplied except for inter-association matches and finals.  This is due to the very low availability of umpires for country appointments.  This poses a major problem for the Mid North Football League.
