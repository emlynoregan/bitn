Goyder Council has had a series of meetings over the last week to hear public reaction to Goyder Council’s Rate Review Committee.  At Burra there was dissatisfaction that the Council was not working towards rate parity for Burra Town area as promised when the Councils merged in 1997.  Ex Councillor Chris Red said that not only was the Burra town rate higher, but also valuations there for equivalent houses were higher compared with other towns.  There were also inconsistencies; for example three-quarters of the cost of the Burra Community Activity Centre was to be borne by Burra Town, but Robertstown Day Care costs would be borne by the whole Council area, including Burra Town.
