Obituary.  William Trestrail died at Burra Hospital on Wednesday 16 December.  He was born in Burra on 18 January 1858, the eldest son of the late William & Mary Trestrail of Burra, in that part of Kooringa known in the early days as ‘The Paddock’ and now sometimes as Paradise.  The home is still standing.  His parents, amongst the earliest of colonists, later moved to Penwortham.  On leaving school he was apprenticed to William James, saddler of Clare and later came to live in Burra, where he was employed by Mr Philip Lane at his Aberdeen Saddlery.  From there he went to Koomooloo to work for the late Mr Thomas Warnes, pioneer pastoralist.  On Mr Warnes’ death he carried on with his son, the late Mr Charles B. Warnes at Woolgangi and for some years past with Mr Reg. Warnes of Woolgangi, nephew of Mr C.B. Warnes.  He spent 52 years serving three generations of the Warnes family.  Although almost 85 years old Mr Trestrail desired to remain at Woolgangi and only came in to Burra for medical treatment.  He never married, but leaves three brothers: Joseph (Solomontown), Steve (Magill) and James (Hendon) and two sisters, Mrs Emma Oats (Edwardstown) and Mrs Stokes of Woodville.  [William John Trestrail born 25 January 1858 Kooringa: died 16 December 1942 Burra.  His father, William Trestrail Sen. arrived in SA in 1846.]
