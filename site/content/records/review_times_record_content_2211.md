A Burra Conservation and Planning Study has been initiated jointly by the Burra Burra DC, the National Trust and the SA Government.  Following a grant from the Heritage Commission, a steering committee has engaged a firm of Planning and architectural Consultants to undertake the study over a three month period.  Policies and practical guidelines will be developed to encourage tourism and commerce.  Much of the early settlement, old mines and historic buildings are intact and set within a pleasant town character.  It is important because so much of the original settlement and mines still exist.  Consultants will prepare a planning scheme with policies, guidelines and proposals aimed at enhancing the history and character of the town to ensure future development is sympathetic to the existing character.  The community will be involved by way of public displays later in the project, but persons wishing to be involved are invited to address comments on the project care of the Burra Burra DC.
