Weather.  Heavy rain was falling last week as we went to press.  Some places received only a little, but in many places the falls were heavy.  Many creeks ran bankers.  The flood waters in Pine Creek were estimated at 20 ft.  At Poonunda Mr Percy Oates reported 137 points in a few minutes.  At the goldfields the deluge was so sudden that hundreds of tons of rocks were washed down slope and drives and shafts were flooded.  Mr Phil Schwier foresaw the danger and rushed through the big mine, but even so some men had to pass through water up to their armpits and emerged looking like drowned rats.  At the men’s changing house in the gully near the entrance to Byles’ Mine the water rose to within nine inches of the roof, which had to be taken off to allow the recovery of the clothes.
