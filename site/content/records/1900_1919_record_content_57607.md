Peace Day

A meeting was held last Thursday to organise the best way to celebrate peace.  The date cannot be fixed until after the Peace Conference at Versailles in January.  Mr Penrose was appointed to be responsible for decorations.  It was decided to have a two-day celebration: one in Market Square, historically the centre for activities, and a second the following Saturday at Victoria Park for the children.

Soldiersâ€™ Aid and Red Cross will provide the luncheon, the Caledonian Soc. will be asked to send three bagpipers.  J.C. Killicoat will convene the procession and funds collected will go towards the Memorial for the Town & District.

F. Harris is in charge of souvenirs and buttons.  Messrs Crewes, McLaren & Dane were appointed a committee to put in a claim for a gun or two by way of trophies.  A silk Union Jack will be auctioned on the Bugler system.  There will be the usual range of stalls.  Fireworks will be arranged for the first night.
