Burra Mine.  (Article from the Bulletin.)  So far prospecting in and around the Burra Mine has not given much encouragement.  The best prospects are from 8,000-10,000 tons of stuff above the water level.  A trial lot has been sent to Wallaroo and if it proves worthwhile a small mill will be set up and the scrapings will be put through.  Altogether SA mining is deadly dull.  Apart from the Wallaroo and Moonta mines there is only the Yorke Peninsula salt industry from which last yearâ€™s output was c. 40,000 tons.  It mainly employs seasonally unemployed farmers.
