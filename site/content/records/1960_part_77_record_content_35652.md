Decimal Currency.  From today the dual currency period ends; six months earlier than originally contemplated.  From today all sales, contracts and legal documents must be in dollars and cents.  All payments must be in terms of dollars and cents.  Advertisers are urged to drop the use of Â£.s.d from today.  Old notes and coins remain legal tender for the payment of amounts expressed in dollars and cents.  Halfpennies, pennies and threepences can be used in lots worth six pence, which is equivalent to 5 cents.  Old coins are being replaced.  The vast majority of accounting, and adding machines and cash registers have already been converted.  Petrol pumps and scale conversion is just over 50%.  (Petrol pumps are at about 60 %.)
