Kooringa News, 14 August

The elections for the Legislative Council aroused no interest here and in fact only 54 of more than 400 on the roll bothered to vote.

A storm last Friday week extended far to the northeast where watercourses were in flood.  The mail was delayed three hours at Meredy Creek, which was running ten feet deep.

Captains Deeble and Morrison have completed their inspection of the Bon Accord Mine, but it is not known whether their report will be favourable.  Mr Deeble has worked in the Burra Mine and is thus likely to be acquainted with the ground.

All business here is very dull.
