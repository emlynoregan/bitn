Burra Town Council, 20 January

Concessions were granted on bus licences to T.P. Halls and R.A. Bevan.

Mr J. Williams complained that the road to Hampton was too narrow and he asked it to be made a chain road as at present it carried a lot of traffic.  The Town Clerk reported that the terrain was such that it could not [at least readily] be widened and in any case was wide enough for the traffic.

The request of A.T. Pearce to move the betting shop to best place was debated at some length.  It was considered that the proposed place was too small.

A complaint that cyclists were riding across the swing bridge was discussed.  It was resolved to take action against cyclists riding on footpaths and footbridges.

Crs Dow and Jennison, who had been absent from the previous meeting expressed their admiration for the new Council furniture.
