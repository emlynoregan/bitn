Burra & District War Memorial Committee AGM was held in the Council Chamber recently.  The President Mr K.J. Murphy reported that unless they got more support from the public the War Memorial Oval would come to a standstill.  The work of afternoon teas at matches this year was very good and thanks must go to Mr & Mrs Scroop and Mr & Mrs Halliday and to Mr E.T. Baulderstone for supplying goods.  Proceeds were about [illegible] which was the best money spinner for the year.  The ball brought in [illegible].  Thank go to the Town Council for work done at the oval and to the District Council for what they had done at the basketball courts and to the Burra Cricket Association for their donation and to Mr C. Pearce for painting the oval fence.  Elected: President, K.J. Murphy; Vice-President, D.A. Halliday; Secretary, Mr E.R. Davey had been Secretary to 23 October when Mr H.
