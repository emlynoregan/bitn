Redruth Reformatory

On 4 May three girls, Florence Linguist, Alice Seitner & Alice House attempted suicide by drinking Quibell’s disinfectant.  The girls recovered and have lost certain privileges.  The first two have not previously been troublesome, but Alice House is regarded as incorrigible.  Although not yet of age Alice House married a Chinaman Ah Tuck who lives at Findon.  She pretended to be over 21.

The first two girls gave no reason for their actions and Alice House said it was a dreadful thing to be a State Child.  An earlier incident when most staff and several girls were apparently afflicted by poison is now believed to have been accidental poisoning by ptomaine as a result of eating tainted meat.

Alice Seitner’s parents live at Baldina and she is in the Reformatory for misconduct at home.

[Marriage records show Alice House, daughter of Frederick House, and aged 21 to have married Ah Tuck, son of Way May aged 31 at the residence of C. Worthley Brompton Park 14 April 1905.  She was actually born 5 June 1887 and so was only 17 at the time.]

[Alice Seitner was sent to the reformatory for being a neglected child and any misconduct was more likely to have been by her parents who appear in scandalous circumstances in the paper: VI, 434, 24 April 1885, page 3; XV, 436, 26 Sep. 1900, page 3 & XV, 437 (2), 10 Oct. 1900, page 3.]
