Methodist Women gathered at Kapunda on 4 June for the annual rally of Methodist Guilds in the District of Light.  Over 200 attended from as far afield as Nuriootpa, Balaklava, Burra, Mt Bryan, Gawler, Hamley Bridge and Tarlee.  This will be the last such gathering as districts will be redistributed into presbyteries with church union in 1976.
