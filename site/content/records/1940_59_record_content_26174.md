Obituary.  John Frederick Wilhelm Kakoschke of Burra died on Friday night after a long illness aged 58.  He was born at Morgan in 1912 and was married at Robertstown to Miss Mary Hemple [sic] of Morgan.  The couple came to Burra and resided here until his death.  On arrival in Burra Mr Kakoschke worked for the late Mr Tom McBride and later carried on as a shearer and general contractor.  23 years ago he organised his well-known carrying business, serving the eastern pastoral country from Burra.  As a result he became very well known to residents of the pastoral plains.  In recent years he has carried on this business in partnership with his sons.  He was an adherent of the Seventh Day Adventist Church at Burra North and took a keen interest in its activities and was also interested in the public welfare of the town.  He is survived by his widow, three sons (Messrs William Clement and Glen) and two daughters (Mavis, Mrs Ron Bain of Adelaide and Jean, Mrs H. Wegner of Angaston.)
