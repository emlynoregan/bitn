Notice.  To Mrs J.A. Dixon, Hanson.

Do you refer to bad language on the Monday night, if so we give this an absolute denial.  It was your own husband when he ordered us off the place.  We are prepared to take this further if you wish.  You were very very glad to come into the country and join hands with one of those little country folks.  Ask your little country folk (husband) about stuffing up chimneys when young married couples were absent from home.

We are Harold Humphrys, James White, Reuben Rogers, Stan Winders & Thos. McNamara.
