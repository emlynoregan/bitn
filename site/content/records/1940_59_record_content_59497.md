Hanson Methodist Church held its Jubilee services on Sunday 7 June 1953.  Rev. E.M. Ingamells, a former Redruth minister, returned for the occasion and preached for each service.  It was 30 years since he was last at Hanson and though now superannuated he gave vigorous and enthusiastic sermons, which are reported in about ½ column.

The Hanson Church is known as the Wesley Bi-Centenary Church – the only such named in the Commonwealth because it was opened on the 200th anniversary of John Wesley’s birth, when the circuit minister was Rev. W.F. James.  He was State Secretary for the birthday celebrations and launched an appeal all over the state and beyond for funds for the memorial church.  The church opened on Good Friday 1904, before which services had been held in the District Council Chambers for 25 years.  Mr Jesse Humphrys started the financial side with a donation of £20, though that was some years before building got under way.  The Church Hall was built in 1928.  Moves were made for this at a memorial service to Jesse Humphrys (grandfather of Roy Humphrys of ‘Blink Bonnie’) to be named the Jesse Humphrys Memorial Hall, but it took some years to realise this aim.  A concert to conclude the celebrations was held on 8 June and in all the Church Trust will benefit by over £30 from the Jubilee.  [The concert is reviewed in c. ½ column and a number of visitors to the Jubilee are named in the article.]

[The first services in the church were actually held on the 20 December 1903, which makes 1953 a more reasonable Jubilee year than a 1904 opening would suggest, though why celebrate in June is not clear.  It was in June 1903 that the name of the church was chosen and memorial stones were laid on 14 October that year.]
