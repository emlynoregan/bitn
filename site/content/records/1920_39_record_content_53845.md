E.H. Woollacott writes accusing Mr A.L. Bence of hiding his head in the sand.  He says: initially Mr Bence wanted to strongly criticise my policy as Mayor of purchasing goods outside the town and then he decided to criticise the system in vogue of the distribution of unemployment relief which he assumes that I favour.  In reply I pointed out that no goods were purchased outside, but that the Government made available a certain limited quantity of clothing available entirely outside and supplemented to the system of unemployment relief, which as any informed person knows is conducted on a very different basis.

‘Luckily for them he is quite unable to drag other local businessmen into this fragrant retreat.  Finally I have no objection to paper criticisms, constructive if possible and based on facts and any other kind is a waste of good time and space.’
