Burra ambulance Service has had a successful recruiting campaign.  Eleven people have elected to take the Application Interview and medical process, prior to beginning the Recruit Training Course due to start on 31 May.  The Burra team hopes as many of them as possible will successfully complete the course and so ensure the future of the Ambulance Service in Burra for 2000.
