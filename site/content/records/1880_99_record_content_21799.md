Burra Town Council.  Cr W.R. Ridgway moved there be no reduction in water rates this year, as a whole yearâ€™s operations were needed to ascertain the true position before making such a decision.  This was eventually carried 4-2.

The Mayor called attention to the need for a crossing of the creek near the new school.

This was referred to the Public Works Committee for a report.
