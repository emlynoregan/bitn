Burra Hospital AGM

Chairman Mr R.K. Pearse reported that the general layout of phase three of the building project had been approved and tenders will be called soon for submission to the Chief Secretary.  Phase 3 of the original plan is expected to cost up to $100,000.  At present hospital funds are in credit $24,000.  Phase 2, the middle section of the building, was completed at a cost of $14,000 from the hospital’s own resources, as were the complete exterior repainting and repairs at a cost of $9,000.

Mr Baulderstone congratulated the Chairman and the Board on the improvements made over the last four years.

The Chairman reported a sound financial position.  The overdraft had been reduced by $2,142 to $5,991 and there is an overall credit balance of $24,114.

Repairs and replacements have risen by $6,743.

Patient fees have risen by $4,647 and Government subsidy and Council contributions are up by $1,304.

The daily average of Inpatients increased by 0.3 to 16.3.

This has helped keep average costs under control.

The collection of patient fees is 98%.

Births fell by 7 to 43.

[He then lists a number of items bought to improve the hospital’s equipment.]

A major program of maintenance cost $9,000.  [This is then detailed.]

The third phase is the building on the old Burra Hotel site of the theatre and casualty wing and turning the old theatre block into domestic quarters and a sewing room.  The Mining Company has been consulted before drawing up these plans.  When the new Theatre Wing – ‘which I recommend to the incoming Board be known as the Alice Collins Wing’ – is completed, we will have a most up-to-date hospital.  We must acknowledge the great help in planning given by the Director General of Medical Services, Dr Rollison and architects Stapleton, McMichael and Loveday.

In the cropping program this year there is only about 30 acres under crop, thanks to Don Stockman and land leased from the Burra Council.  Mr Tom Rogers has sown 50 acres of Hanson Reserve to clover.  Last year we received $1,416 from wheat sales.

The Auxiliary remains active and the maintenance of the linen and the stocking of shelves with preserves and jams owes much to them.

The Burra & District Fund Raising Committee raised $850 this year.

The high standard of service and efficiency has been maintained by Matron Fyfe, ably assisted by Sister Taylor and on a part-time basis by Sisters Leedham and Byles.

The trainee nurses have done their jobs well and the cleanliness of the buildings inside and outside is a credit to the domestic staff.

The financial stability of the Hospital has been strengthened by the work of our Secretary-Manager Mr L.H. Packer.
