BCS held a 120/20 Concert in the Burra Town Hall last Thursday and Friday to celebrate the school’s 120th anniversary and the Community Library’s 20th birthday.  There were full houses for a program that spanned the 120 years, with items from Gilbert & Sullivan to the Roaring 20s, the Rocky Horror Show and the Spice Girls.  The school was opened on 25 January 1978, with an enrolment of 420, though average attendance in the first year was below 300.

‘Nine months later the Burra Mine closed down, and the school never catered for the 800 students originally envisaged.’

[No.  This is an error.  The mine closed 29 September 1877.]

The plan to build BCS was announced in 1975 and it was opened 14 April 1978.
