Royal Adelaide Show

Burra students had two teams in the finals of the Briggs & Stratton engine tear-down competition.  In the heats the two Burra teams came in 2nd and 3rd.  In the finals the team of Troy Lloyd and Jason white came in as winners and Damien Slade and Fraser Neil came 4th, which was very pleasing considering they had been a late inclusion in the event.
