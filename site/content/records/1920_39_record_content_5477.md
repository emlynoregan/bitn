Dr Steele writes again on the examination of swabs from infectious cases, saying that his original question was contained in a concise eight lines.  [Responding to Cr Kellaway’s charge of wordiness.]  He says that on his return from the war he tried hard to effect a reconciliation with Dr Ashton, but to no avail and now ‘informal discussion between the Health Officer and myself was unfortunately out of the question’.

He goes on to wonder at the apparent panic and confusion at the mention of swabs, but ends by saying:

‘It was the duty of the Local Board to obtain for me the information sought, and because it is important I have persisted in my quest.’
