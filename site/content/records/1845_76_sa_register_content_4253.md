Resident Magistrate’s Court, Kooringa, 24 January

Mary Jilbert was fined 10/- with 24/- costs for using extremely abusive language to Elizabeth Le Levre.  Jilbert had asked Le Levre for some money she said was owed her.  When the complainant denied owing her any money Jilbert called her most infamous names and said her husband had ‘married her off the streets of Adelaide’.  Witnesses supported Le Levre.

Samuel Broad was charged with detaining a dog belonging to William Rule.  Rule said he had been given the dog by a person who had gone to California.  He had registered it about six months ago and afterwards lost him.  Broad agreed to return the dog and to pay costs.

John Hunter alleged that Thomas Wilson had come into his hut on the night of 23 January, dragged him from his bed and assaulted him.  Wilson, who employed Hunter, said two other men slept in the hut with Hunter and would testify that Hunter was subject to fits of delirium tremens and was in that state when he imagined the offence.

David Smith and James Hinch confirmed this and said no disturbance occurred in the hut that night.

His Worship declined to give a judgement at this time on the case.
