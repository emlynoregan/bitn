Burra fire fighter Ian Kleinig is making progress after suffering a major injury while fighting the Victorian bushfires last Wednesday.  Ian was working on the containment of the Murrindindi fires near Alexandria, about 60 km northeast of Melbourne, when he was struck by a falling limb.  He was taken to Melbourne for treatment and his wife Annie and father flew to Melbourne to be by his side.    CFS chief officer Euan Ferguson said the incident was a reminder of the unpredictable hazards faced by fire fighters.  At the weekend Ianâ€™s two sons, Josh & Ben were also flown to Melbourne with their grandmother.  Fundraising efforts to assist the family have been organised and a book for supportive comments has been placed at the Burra Post Office.
