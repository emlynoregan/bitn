After a couple more witnesses Mr Fitzgerald summed up, pointing out inconsistencies in the evidence of the various witnesses.  He pointed out that neither of the accused could read or write and so would not know what was on an order received in change.  He contended there was no case to answer.

After retiring for 20 minutes Mr Lang returned and said the Bench had decided that the charge of stealing the order was not sustained and as a consequence the charge of receiving a stolen order failed.

From the known good characters of the prisoners this case excited much interest at Kooringa; and we understand that Mr Fitzgerald has received instructions to commence an action against Mr Stace forthwith.
