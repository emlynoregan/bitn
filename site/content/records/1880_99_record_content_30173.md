A Spate of Thefts.

John McGrath was sentenced to 6 months in Redruth Gaol for theft last Friday of a saddle belonging to J. McLaren of Kooringa.  On Monday at Petersburg he had stolen a bridle from the Junction Hotel stables and sold it.  He then stole the reins from Mr Wilson’s wagon in the hotel yard.  He will serve a further 6 months in Gladstone Gaol for those offences.

William Banks was sentenced to 3 months for stealing a watch from Mr Henry Skewes.

A coloured man, James Ahange got 6 months for stealing £2-10-0 in silver from the pocket of a lodger at the Kooringa Hotel.  [He appears in Gaol records as the Chinese Ah Hang.]
