Obituary.  Mr Sampson Vivian was killed in an accident at South Mine, Broken Hill, on 21 July.  He was a brother to Mr H. Vivian of the Commercial Hotel and was well known in Burra.  He arrived here over 40 years ago and has since reared a family.  The inquest failed to explain just how he met his death.

Samuel Walter Cherry said he left the deceased on the 3rd platform near the chute and ascended to the 4th platform.  Soon after he called for Vivian to hand up some wood.  Receiving no reply, he shouted down to the other men if they had seen Vivian and they said they had not.  He was found bleeding and unconscious at the bottom of the chute.  Other evidence showed that the top of the chute on the 3rd platform had been securely covered with laths that morning and was the same immediately afterwards.  One theory is that one 10” lath was dislodged and Vivian had fallen through and when another miner noticed the missing lath it was replaced without him knowing anything of the accident.  The deceased’s pipe was however, found on the second flat, suggesting he had gone down there for some unknown reason and the accident happened there.  The mystery remains unresolved.

[The marriage records of his marriage 10 September 1865 suggest he was born c. 1841.]
