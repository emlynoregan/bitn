The Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting was held last Friday, but evoked little interest and a small attendance.  Mr J. Sampson presided.  E.W. Crewes reported the last year.

The year started in credit £24-7-0 and the present credit is £42-4-1, but with several important works continuing little will remain by the year’s end.  The assessed value for 1900 is £35-12-8 less than in 1899 (Total £8,507-9-0).  North Ward lamps cost £7-14-0 and in West and East Wards the cost was £4-17-6 each.  [This suggests two lamps in North Ward: one at the Royal Exchange corner, but where was the other?]

The cemetery began in credit £46-5-0 and is now £36-2-4.  Vandalism has been a problem, but the names of offenders have been obtained and steps taken to prevent a recurrence.

Last year the meeting of ratepayers on the Waterworks issue resolved that the Council should continue to control the Waterworks and carry on as cheaply as possible.  The approach to the Government for a reduction in the capital account and the rate of interest was rejected and now the Government wants the Council to take on a seven year lease.  At present the Council is retaining possession as monthly tenants.  The Council resolved some months ago to hand the works to the Government at the end of the year.  Two months ago the Council asked the Government to send an expert to test the boiler as they feared its condition.  Last week this was done and several defective plates needed immediate attention.  Repairs were carried out in one day.  While he was here the expert was asked about the small boiler and this is now being put in a state of repair to carry on while the Cornish boiler is being repaired.  In the future there will not have to be a stoppage just because the large boiler requires maintenance work.
