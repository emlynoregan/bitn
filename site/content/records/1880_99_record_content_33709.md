A petition of 1000 signatures was presented to Parliament arguing against any moves to direct more of the Barrier traffic away from Port Pirie and to Port Adelaide, which already had preferential freight costs to put it on a parity with Port Pirie.  Adelaide already had too great a concentration of the colonyâ€™s population.  A direct line from Morgan, Eudunda, or Burra to Broken Hill should not be contemplated.  If the present line were inadequate a better answer would be a line from Carrieton to Manna Hill or Winnininnie to take advantage of Port Augusta.  The writer urged an end to the break of gauge and dismisses Port Augusta as a ridiculous place for a major port.
