Redruth Methodist Church celebrated its 94th Anniversary on Sunday 3 June.  Rev. J.C. Richmond of Clare took the three services and delivered very interesting addresses.  W.H. Gare led the choir.  There was a public tea at 5 p.m. on Monday and a public meeting at 7.30 p.m.  Treasurer S.J. Woollacott showed that the Trust had a satisfactory working credit balance.  Rev. Richmond gave a very interesting talk on the early days of his ministry in the mining fields of Tarcoola, after which there was a general adjournment to the supper room.
