English & Australian Copper Co.

The ordinary general meeting was held on 27 February.  For the 12 months to 30 June 1872 the company had ore, regulus etc handled had been 6564 tons compared with 5441 the previous year.  The copper made at the Port Adelaide smelter had been 1535 tons compared with 1518 tons the previous 12 months.   The board had declared the 21st dividend of 2/6 per share.  With the interim dividend paid in September, this gave a 10% dividend for the year, plus £1,750 paid to the Reserve Fund.  A fall of £13 per ton in the value of copper had prevented the even better returns predicted at the last meeting from being achieved.  With prices seemingly now more settled at between £90 and £100 per ton the future looked very promising.  The opening of the telegraph link between Adelaide and Darwin on 21 October would be advantageous and prevent agents in London buying at higher prices when a drop had occurred here.  They had hoped that the Burra Mine would have contributed very much more than it had in the past year.  This had been because of the non-completion of the dressing machinery on that property.  This should soon be rectified and there was every reason to expect they would soon receive very large supplies from that mine.  Their agent had been negotiating for Queensland ores and when these ores were obtained no smelting company would be in a better position.  ‘They possessed excellent works on the Burra Burra property at Adelaide, and now at their new works at Newcastle, which were situated actually at the pit’s mouth.’
