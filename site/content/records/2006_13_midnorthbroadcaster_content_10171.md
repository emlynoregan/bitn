Burra Quilters report by President Maureen Fuss.

The year began with much work towards the exhibition in May, finishing off quilts from workshops in 2008 and making blocks for the quilt to be raffled at the exhibition.  A group visited three quilt exhibitions in the Barossa during the Vintage festival.  The exhibition in May was a great success.  The People’s Choice award went to Pauline Miller again and everyone was shocked and saddened by her unexpected death in February 2010.  In May we received a cheque for $4,500 from the principal of the local school, who had applied for a community grant on our behalf, to further our involvement in supporting local charities.  A retreat to Camp Willochra at Melrose was another enjoyable weekend at the end of May.  A wonderful Christmas dinner at the home of Judy and David Miller concluded the year.  Funds from the raffled quilt at the exhibition went to the Motor Neurone Disease Organisation.

The Burra Quilters Group is a very active organisation with members from Burra, Booborowie, Mt Bryan, Hallett, Farrell Flat, Clare and Sturtvale Station.  As well as making quilts for their own pleasure, they make quilts for charity. One recently completed for the Burra Hospital Auxiliary will be raffled at the 2010 Melbourne Cup Luncheon.  Today they group is hosting the Biggest Quilting Bee with proceeds going to the Cancer Council in conjunction with the Biggest Morning Tea.
