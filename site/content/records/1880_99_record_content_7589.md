Mount Bryan Ratepayers’ Meeting, 5 August.

The Council will try to buy the present Council Chamber, which is for sale to clear its debt.

The Education Department is to be asked to build a school and teacher’s residence on Section 80 or 91 - there being a desire for a central location.

There is a request that the Council Chambers be a polling station.

The platform needs lengthening with shelter for passengers and a goods shed.
