Burra Golf Club.  A retaining wall has been built around the number one tee block to make a feature of the clubhouse.  Last week Jack McMahon and a team of club members sowed the fairways.  The sanding of the greens and the hours spent by club members working on tee blocks is bringing the project near completion.  It is hoped to be able to open the course on the Easter Weekend with an official opening on the long weekend in May.  It is hoped this year to increase membership to 100 full members.
