Goyder Council

Cr Peter Reilly advised he had received a 25-page petition from ratepayers concerned about Market Square and Best Place redevelopment.  Council will hold a formal public meeting.

Council staff have been told to start asbestos management arrangements.

A charge of $200 will be made for organisations seeking to close roads for events.

An updated concept plan from the consultants for Market Square and Best Place redevelopment was tabled at the meeting on 20 September.

Thomas Pickett has been nominated by Council for the Walk of Fame.

A request from W. & C. Clonan to remove a street tree in front of their property in Kingston Street was denied.

All licences for the removal of timber, firewood etc. from road reserves within the council area have been revoked.

Vandals smashed four car windows of a vehicle parked in a Burra North back yard last weekend and a window was also smashed at BCS.  (Values $4,000 and $300 respectively.)  A window has been broken at the silos sometime in the past three months.
