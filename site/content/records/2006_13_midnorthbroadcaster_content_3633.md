BCS.  Goyder House, the boarding house for school students at Burra, has become increasingly successful.  Rooms are booked through to 2013 and 2008 sees rooms filled to a maximum with 14 students already enrolled and five on the waiting list.  BCS staff are seeking interested community members to think about taking boarders.  The boarding house opened in 1993 to provide a place for children who have to travel long distances for their education.  The two storey facility caters for 14 students with nine rooms available.  Girls are accommodated upstairs and boys downstairs.  Most students come from isolated pastoral areas.  A live-in supervisor is responsible for day to day running of the hostel and the care of students.  BCS principal Jim Low puts much of the success of the venture down to Michelle Cooper, who has been the supervisor or ‘House mum’ for four years.  There are no plans to expand the size of the operation.
