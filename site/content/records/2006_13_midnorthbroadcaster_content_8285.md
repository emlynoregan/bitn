Tree Planting is being undertaken along Burra Creek as part of the beautification program.  The Burra Creek Committee and students from Burra Community School have been working together planting trees obtained through the Goyder Council and the Trees for Life program.  Last week the Year 8 Agricultural Science class planted 130 trees in an hour of class time.  Bruce Stockman, Chairman of the Burra Creek Committee thanked the students for their enthusiasm and input.
