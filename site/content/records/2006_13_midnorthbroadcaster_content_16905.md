Roy Taplin has been recognised as a heritage hero after being nominated by the Premier Mr Jay Weatherill to receive an SA Heritage Heroes Award 2013.  The premier met Mr Taplin during a visit to the Burra Railway Station this year.  Mr Taplin, a retired master painter and decorator has carried out meticulous restoration at the Burra Town Hall and following the receipt of a Government Grant in 2010 began work on the Burra Railway Station.  Here there was extensive termite damage and the interior had been invaded by pigeons.  A local builder and plumber were appointed to assist, but Mr Taplin co-ordinated the project and also carried out many major repairs and undertook the painting.  His efforts included replacing floor stumps, repairs to fretting walls, replacement of rotting and termite damaged architraves and skirting, manufacturing kitchen cupboards and mantelpieces as well as the painting.  The station will ultimately house an interpretive centre focussed on Burraâ€™s natural history prior to European settlement.  Roy is very reluctant to seek any publicity or acknowledgement of his work and so was not informed of his nomination, said friend and President of the Burra History group Ms Meredith Satchell.  She said previous experience had suggested he would probably have declined the award had he learned of it.  As a consequence Ms Satchell accepted the awards for Roy at the Bob Hawkes Building at the University of South Australia last Tuesday night and handed it to him at the railway station later. [Photo]
