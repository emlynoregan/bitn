3rd Leader on the Salvation Army.  The writer says that despite the sometimes erratic doings of the Army religious liberty and personal freedom of the age demands that we protest against some of the types of opposition currently being waged against the Army.  Despite claims that people oppose the Army’s supposed interference with public or individual right, we believe the true reason is a dislike of the doctrines they teach and the restraints they seek to impose.  The likes of the Skeleton Army do not usually defend the rights of others or the public good; they act to desire liberty for their own profit without regard of others.  So strong is the prejudice that the Army is dragged off to prison while their opponents are set free or given nominal fines when they deserve imprisonment for a considerable time.
