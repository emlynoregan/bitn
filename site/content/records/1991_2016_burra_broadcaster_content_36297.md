The 6th Annual National Youth Week (NYW) will run from 9-17 April.  Goyder YAC has organised an open air party as its NYW event.  It will be at the Burra Show Grounds 9 April from 7 p.m. to 1 a.m.  Entry will be free of charge.  All youth 12-25 are welcome.  The committee is aware of the difference in age of young people eligible to attend and has tried to cater for all within that age range.  Attendance for only part of the night is expected for many of the younger youth.
