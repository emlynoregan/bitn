Obituary.  Mrs Christina Behla, an early resident of Burra, but recently of Kiata, Victoria, died last week aged 81.  She came to Adelaide in 1855 from Werben in Germany with her husband who died 15 years ago.  They lived at Burra in the early days of the mine and she was well known south of Burra where her husband later farmed.  She is survived by a son and three daughters.

[Probably born Christiane/Christiana/Christina Domarschenz/Domaschenz/Domaschens and her husband was apparently Matthias Behla.]
