Burra Cycling Classic will be run this coming weekend.  The format will be different this time, with the main race reduced to 82 km.  The new route will go north to Mt Bryan and return to Burra before taking the bypass road back to the Barrier Highway and thence to Burra and Commercial Street.  There will then be four circuits of Commercial Street, Market Street, Morehead St, Copperhouse St and then the Barrier Highway back to Commercial St.  Sunday will see graded criterion races for juniors and seniors.
