A Bolt.  Mr L. Grow was unloading empty hogsheads from the former Unicorn Brewery at the Railway Station when one of them fell against the horsesâ€™ heels.  They bolted across the lines and as a train was due from Mt Bryan danger was apprehended, but Mr Grow managed to stop them and retrieve both horses and trolley before the train arrived.
