On 9 April a group went up onto Brewery Hill to hear the announcement that a phone tower would soon be erected there.  John Cuffley, Regional Manager of SA NT Telstra Mobile Net Services said it would go up over the following two months.  Barry Wakelin MP said he had to be there to hear the news.  There are blue tongue lizards in the area and their safety will be addressed.  Digital towers are already operating at Black Springs, Peter’s Hill and Hallett.  John Cuffley said there were no immediate plans to install CDMA technology, but it could be looked at.  The nearest CDMA connection for now would be at Clare.
