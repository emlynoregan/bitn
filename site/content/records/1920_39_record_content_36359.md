Burra Mine

A meeting was held on Thursday to consider the possibility of the unemployed making some money from the Burra Mine.  Most of those present were unemployed men.  Mr Riggs was detained out east by the rain and E.J. Harris was voted into the chair.  Mr A. Walker said he had studied the books of the mine.  The mine had opened in 1849[sic: actually 1845].  There were five tunnels of 600ft, 300ft, 330ft, 420 ft and 180ft.  The upper levels contained cuprite, malachite, azurite and native copper in rich, but very irregular bodies.  The lower levels had bornite and chalcoryrite.  After making 51,662 long tons of copper the mine closed in 1877.  During this time the surface ores to 60 fathoms had, as far as the managers knew, been worked out.

The mines had been re-organised in 1901 with a subscribed capital of £31,170.  There were then 672 acres of freehold plus 11,065 acres of mineral rights.  In 1903 100 tons of fine copper were produced at an average of only 2% on the ore raised.  Later diamond drilling to test the mine found good ore at 800 to 1,000ft.  He did not think he could recommend that the Government spend large sums to develop the mine, but with Mr McBride’s consent men might be put on tribute to work payable pockets of ore which would pay a man, but not a large company with overheads.  He thought anything from 30 to 50 men might make wages.  A committee was then formed to formulate a plan of action.
