Burra Progress Assoc. believes that Burra suffered a serious trading loss over the holiday period due to the poor state of the main road.  Broken Hill traffic was the lightest for some years.  It was felt that with only 60 of the 325 miles of road bituminised this road had not been treated proportionally with other main roads, such as those to Pt Pirie, Pt Augusta, Barossa Valley, or the Murray River towns.
