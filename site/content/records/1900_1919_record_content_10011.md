Lawrence Kennedy was found riding the crossbars under the brake-van of the Broken Hill Express when it arrived at Burra on Wednesday morning.  He was charged with riding from Mt Bryan to Burra without a ticket and riding under a carriage contrary to SAR regulations.  He was fined Â£1 on each offence or 1 month in gaol.

Kennedy later said he had travelled extensively in the USA this way and a fortnight earlier had travelled from Stawell in Victoria to Murray Bridge, travelling all the night and then travelled into Adelaide under another train.  He had travelled to Hallett from Burra under a wagon on a railway truck and then not liking the look of the country had travelled back as far as Burra under the brake-van.
