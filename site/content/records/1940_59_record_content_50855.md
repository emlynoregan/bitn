Football.  Travelling to Terowie on Saturday was difficult for the Burra Footballers.  The road between Ulooloo and Mt Bryan was particularly slippery and most cars covered 10 of the 15 miles sideways.  There were two minor accidents when one car slid into a fence and another into a culvert.  Fortunately there was no serious damage.  Another car was swamped with water and stopped.  The match resulted in a win to Terowie 5.14 to Burra 3.3.  [The scores were reported on page 7.]
