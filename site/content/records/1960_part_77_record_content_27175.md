Burra Swimming Pool is still without an attendant following the illness and subsequent death of Mr D. Morrison, who had been appointed caretaker on a five day basis with someone else to open it at weekends.  Mr G. Baulderstone opened it on Saturday and Sunday.  A public meeting is called for 2.30 p.m.  tomorrow (Wednesday) to discuss the possibility of a roster system.  The attendant opens the pool and handles the sale of drinks etc.  A standard of discipline must also be enforced.  Without an attendant the pool will have to remain closed.
