There was another outbreak of contention when the Public Works Chairman, Cr Hardy, complained that a North Ward Councillor had put a man, horse and dray to work without the sanction of the Council.

Cr Linkson said I am the Councillor referred to and I deny emphatically I did so without the sanction of the Chairman of Public Works.  Perhaps Cr Hardy doesn’t remember he told me to do so.  Don’t you remember you and Cr Parks with myself were standing in the Institute Hall on the evening of 3 May and didn’t you tell me I had better proceed with the work?  And now because there has been a squabble today about it you come here tonight and throw the blame on me.  You, Chairman of Public Works, why you are not fit to be anything, and you ought to be ashamed of yourself.

Cr Walsh then supported Cr Linkson.

There was then a reference to the minutes re the appointment of Mr Andrews and they showed him to have been re-appointed as scavenger at £7 per month, including the clearing of watertables from Snell’s to Edward’s shops at £1 a time and horse and dray work as required at 10/- per day for one horse and 13/- for two horses and dray.

[Hardy apparently believed this gave Andrews the right to any of the work available.  Cr Harris held that it merely said what he would be paid if he was awarded work in excess of the scavenging job, but did not mean he should do all the day work.]

Cr Harris: ‘After hearing Cr Linkson’s statement I don’t think he is to blame.’

Cr West: ‘I would sooner take his word than Cr Hardy’s any day.’

Hardy then claimed the work was done without his knowledge.

He believed that Andrews was entitled to the day work and Cr Parks 2nd Hardy’s interpretation and a move to send Andrews the job the next morning.

Cr Linkson said he would not have voted for Andrews re-appointment had he understood he was to get all the day work.

Cr Walsh [Corrected in the paper of 7 June to Cr West] said that Mrs Vivian of Opie’s Hotel was speaking to me relative to erecting a verandah in front of the hotel.  I will propose that the Council inspect the place and decide what they will do.

Cr Hardy: She will have to pay one-half cost of the kerbing.  I have only just found this out, so that is how Rabbich & Sons ‘got out’ of paying their share for the kerbing done near their place.

A voice – Oh what foolishness.

Cr Harris 2nd.  Carried.

There was then further squabbling over matters associated with the Waterworks and minor works in East Ward, but not of great consequence.
