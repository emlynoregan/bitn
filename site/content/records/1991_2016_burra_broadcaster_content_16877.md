Goyder Council has conducted an Environmental Health Management Study, which has unearthed some community needs, including a need for parks and the lack of public toilets.  Robertstown, Booborowie and Terowie need public toilet upgrades.  Parks and more recreational and sporting facilities are needed at Mt Bryan and Terowie and playground equipment at Robertstown.

Rubbish dumps are an issue everywhere except Burra and Terowie.  Street numbers in Burra are undefined and 24% of Burra respondents mentioned uneven/dangerous footpaths.
