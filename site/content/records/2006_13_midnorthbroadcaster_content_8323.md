Patrick Le Vagueresse writes reporting a vandal attack on the Burra Baseball Club premises at the Aberdeen Oval.  About $150 worth of soft drinks were stolen with some collectable baseball caps, first aid gear and a $300 fire extinguisher.  In all damage costs amounted to about $750, which used up all the clubâ€™s funds, so that it is now unable to enter the Country Baseball Tournament for 2009.  This is just on of a number of destructive acts around the town lately.  Tourist sites have been another target.  Surely someone knows something and is honest enough to come forward with information to help end these senseless acts.
