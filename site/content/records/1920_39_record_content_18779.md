Dust Storm.  One of the worst dust storms ever in Burra raged throughout 24 February.  A high hot wind raised a red canopy over the town reaching a climax about 5 p.m., especially in the southern extremity of Kooringa.  In the cemetery headstones were toppled and five were broken.  Trees were torn up and sheds and outhouses were demolished.  At Alf Gebhardtâ€™s fine new residence at the corner of Thames and George St one of the brick pillars of the verandah was smashed.  Four brief muddy showers brought only 24 points of rain.
