Bulk Super

660 tons of bulk super was off-loaded and distributed between Burra & Hallett over the weekend.  It came direct from Wallaroo per 8 rail trucks for Burra and 5 for Hallett.  Unloading was by a super lift hydraulic grab.  The operation involved close co-operation between Adelaide & Wallaroo Fertilizers, SAR and Hirschausen Bros of Burra.
