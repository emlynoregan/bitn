Drought in NSW & Queensland in particular has seen sheep numbers fall from 125 million five years ago to perhaps 90 million or less today.  Wool and stock values are high, but drought has played havoc with NSW stock welfare and the production of fat sheep, lambs and cattle.  In many cases gross results per sheep for wool alone exceeded Â£1 per head.  Only in 1924-25 were such high returns recorded.  Buying of fellmongered wool has been strong from China, the Middle-East and USA and in the new selling season France, Belgium, Italy, Holland and Denmark and other European buyers have been active.  America was a strong buyer for the freer types of merino.  The unfortunate side of the story is the stock losses due to the drought.  Not only was production down, but many areas had high agistment costs as well.  Prices at saleyards have risen sharply.
