Burra Town Council, Special Meeting 6 December.

The mayor, W. West, said Mr John Lewis had asked for the approaching court case to be settled by arbitration which would avoid both sides getting up solicitors from Adelaide.

Cr Sampson felt that with nothing in writing and the whole thing rather vague and the arrangements with solicitors and witnesses so far advanced it would not be wise to change on the verbal wishes of the defendants.  He would not have objected to arbitration if the offer had come earlier.  They needed legal advice and it was too late now.

Crs O’Leary and Watt objected to Cr Sampson’s statement that the defendants had been the first to go to law.

Cr Rabbich moved that the court case go ahead as being the best option at this late stage.

Cr Sampson thought Crs O’Leary and Watt were ignorant except on the side of Bagot, Shakes & Lewis.  In any case before anything could be done there would have to be a notice of motion to rescind the minute already on the book.  [i.e. the motion originally authorising the court action.]

The motion was put and carried on the votes of Crs Rabbich, Sampson and Parks.
