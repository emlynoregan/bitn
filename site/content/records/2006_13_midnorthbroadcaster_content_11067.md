Burra Early Learning Centre

Director Brenda Villis is stepping down after more than 15 years at the helm.  Mrs Villis (referred to by many of the children as Mrs Billis) started working at the centre in Term 2 1994, after almost two decades in primary education.  She became Director at the start of 1995.  Mrs Villis says she has had the honour of teaching many wonderful children in her time there and marvels at the uniqueness of each of them.  She has been a key instigator in many fund raising efforts over the years, which have resulted in many improvements.  Major changes have included the replacement of the drab brown Hessian ceiling and brown beams with a white ceiling and pale blue beams, the occasional care room, the mesh fencing, the safety gates, storage sheds, bike track, landscaping, cubby house and shade cloth.  An impressive array of educational resources has also been acquired.  Sheree Mader will take over as Director.  [Photo of Brenda Villis, Sheree Mader and the children.]

Changes under way at the Early Learning Centre include extensions to the Occasional Care Room to introduce baby changing facilities, fencing and a safety gate for the kitchen area.  In the meantime the centre is operating from the Burra Sports Complex.
