The Methodist Sunday School Rally at Hanson last weekend had to be called off due to Fridayâ€™s heavy rain that made a mess of the Burra-Farrell Flat Road.  The event was transferred to the Burra Methodist Hall.  Five representatives from Hanson managed to get through despite the road and three from Ironmine.  [Details in 1/2 column.]
