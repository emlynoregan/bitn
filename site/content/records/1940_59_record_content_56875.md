River Murray Pipeline.  The Premier Hon. T. Playford has said in Parliament that growth at Woomera and centres at the head of Spencer Gulf means the time is approaching when the Morgan-Whyalla pipeline will need to be duplicated.  A new pipeline would reasonably follow a different route to bring water to places along the way.  From Hanson a branch would go to Burra and the main line to Booborowie, possibly some miles south of Jamestown and go through Caltowie, Wirrabara, via Pt Germein Gorge to the present line east of Pt Germein.
