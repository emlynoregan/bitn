Jazz in the Monster Mine on Saturday was held in balmy conditions, but drew a smaller audience than previously due to the competition from the Barossa Under the Stars and the Peterborough Rodeo on the same weekend.  The event was very successful and was a valuable fundraiser for the Hallett Tennis Club, which managed the bar and provided gourmet dinner packs.
