Editorial on SAMA.

It is not impertinent to consider the way SAMA neglect their property.  The town for so long depended on the mine for its life, but when the mine stopped the town’s prosperity continued due to the development of agricultural interests and the north-east trade.  But the north-eastern agricultural settlement failed and the railway to Broken Hill has taken the trade, causing the prosperity to wane.  Eyes then turned to the mine as a possible source of better days.  Several men are now working there on tribute and making wages even though the water confines them to upper workings and they have only themselves to carry the ore and dress it.  When the mine was prosperous money was not invested in prospecting where the lodes were, which helped to kill the goose that laid the golden egg.

Since then SAMA has been content to collect its property rents and have not done a thing at the mine and have a dog-in-the-manger attitude of not allowing anyone else to work it either.  It is believed offers have been made to work it on tribute or otherwise, but either greed or sloth has prevented any arrangement.  Surely this is overdone as falling town prosperity means lower rents and fewer renters and the value of the freehold falls too.  With copper now at c. £100 per ton we are not reaping any advantage.  We hope some arrangements allowing the marble deposits to be worked at least may be managed.
