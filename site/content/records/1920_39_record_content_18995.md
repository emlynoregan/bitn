Burra Town Council, 15 March

At the Municipal Assoc. the Mayor moved that the Act be changed when motorists are fined for speeding so that the fine goes to the Corporation where it occurs, as it already goes to District Councils if the offence occurs there.

W.H. Spier was granted permission to erect a petrol pump.

F. Pearce was granted permission to build a house for Miss Preece in Morehead St.

W.A. Gebhardt was granted permission to subdivide an area on Hill St.

The Department controlling War Trophies is still considering whether the trustees of the guns were a permanent body.

Cr Riggs said with tarred roads there was a need for more screenings than metal and the Mayor thought the time was approaching when buying a crusher would have to be considered.

Considerable discussion followed on road related issues.

The Mayor said a motion had been carried to use the miner’s effigy [Johnnie Green] as a ‘silent cop’ at the Farmers’ Union corner.  Mrs Pledge (writing anonymously) had suggested it be placed on the new shelter shed on the Aberdeen Road and that the place be called ‘The Miner’s Rest’.

Cr Riggs, as mover of the motion, said that as he had now been told that a ‘silent cop’ had to be erected so that it would come down if hit, he gave notice of intention to rescind the motion.

Drew & Crewes incinerator remained a nuisance, though complaints had been made for 12 months.
