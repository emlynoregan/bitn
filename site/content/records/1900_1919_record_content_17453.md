Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co.  The present directors will clearly not work the mine to any good account.  Before the present owners acquired the mine Messrs Martin & Co. made a good offer to the old owners, but for some reason it was not accepted.  Messrs Martin & Co. then offered the present directors to work the mine on tribute and pay 12½% to the owners, but this too was not accepted.  Martins also offered to unwater the mine and to keep it dry for twelve months and hand the machinery over after that, but the price for that was also unacceptable.  Nothing much is doing at the site and we note the promoters’ shares are on the move which does not augur well.  With a favourable opportunity at Morphett’s Shaft it is hoped lives will not be risked in the proposed shaft [in the open cut].
