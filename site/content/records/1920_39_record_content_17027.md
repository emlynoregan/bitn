‘Back to Burra’ arrangements are almost completed.  Apart from much private accommodation 20 beds for ladies have been set up in the Junior Department of Kooringa Methodist Sunday School and if needed after the big tea on Monday more will be set up in the Senior School and classrooms.  The Salvation Army Hall and the Cheer-up Hall are also being used.  Lady Holder is expected and visitors from WA have already begun to arrive.
