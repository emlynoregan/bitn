Weather.  In the hail storm at Mt Bryan recently Miss Jill Stolte was badly bruised by the hail before she could reach shelter.  At the time she was bringing in the cows for milking.

Mr F. Jefferies lost the roof from one shed and two strips from the roof of his big hay shed along with the two big sliding doors.

The hail cut standing oats crops to pieces.  A new tank on the railway platform was blown down to the cattle yards at the north end of the town and en route badly bent a windmill tower.
