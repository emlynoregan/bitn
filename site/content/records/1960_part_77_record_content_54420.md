Obituary.  Rev. Milton Edwards conducted the funeral service for William Ernest Dunhill at Redruth Church on 23 December 1970.  [Officially Ernest William Dunhill.]  He was born at Kersbrook 18 October 1874 and died at Redruth 21 December 1970 aged 96.  He had long been a faithful servant of the church.  His ministry as a local preacher covered a continuous period of 77 years.  He lived as he preached, in utter sincerity.  [Rev. Edwards reported hearing Mr Dunhill preach only once on 8 September 1968 and he preached only twice after that before failing health forced him to give up the work.]

He was essentially a nineteenth century man with an uneasy tolerance of the technological changes around him.  He was forty when WWI broke out and he came to Burra a year later.  In his teens he had gone to Orroroo to work on his uncle’s farm and in his mid 20s went to WA working in a timber mill in the jarrah forests.  He was at a blacksmith’s shop at Iron Knob when the iron ore industry began, before the town was built.  He then worked for some years at the mines in Broken Hill and was a handy blacksmith by the time he reached Burra in 1915.  He married in the first decade of the twentieth century [1908] and his wife died in 1950.  He outlived each member of a long-lived family.  Almost every Sunday for 50 years he rang the bell of the Redruth Church and for many years sang in the choir.  His work as a Sunday school Superintendent and teacher helped to mould the lives of successive generations of children now grown to adulthood.  He has a self effacing modesty and the strength of an independent spirit that refused to accept defeat.  The President of the Methodist Conference A.D. Blunt sent a telegram to ‘acknowledge the long life of service rendered by William Dunhill.’

[Note from earlier 85, 39 (4), 8 Oct. 1963, page 1

Mr E.W. Dunhill (89) has completed 72 years of service as a lay preacher – a record unequalled in the Methodist Church in Australia.  Mr Dunhill was born at Kersbrook in SA and in his early life went to WA.  He married there in 1908 and returned to SA in 1909, taking up residence in Burra in 1915.  He carried on business as a blacksmith for 65 years until he was 83.  He took his first church service at the age of 16 years 11 months.  He was the first person in Australia to hold a certificate recognising 60 years service as a lay preacher.  He was also active in Sunday school work for many years and was Sunday School Superintendent for 37 years.]
