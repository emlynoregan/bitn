The Jailhouse Rock Festival will be held in February.  There will be a movie night on Friday 25 February, after which you can Rock and Roll until late at the Burra Hotel with the music of Paul O’Bryan’s Band.  The band will also play for a Rock and Roll Dance Demonstration in Market Square.  The main event will take place in the exercise yard of Redruth Gaol with the Adelaide Band: Rockin the Jukebox.  The event ends with a barbecue brunch on Sunday morning along the Burra Creek.
