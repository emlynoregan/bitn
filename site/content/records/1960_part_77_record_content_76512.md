Burra Golf Club

The new clubhouse will be opened on 28 September at 4 p.m.  Four years ago Council acquired the Racecourse and Elder’s Paddock to develop into a recreation area.  Following an offer and request from Council the Golf Club undertook an ambitious plan to redesign the golf course and erect a new clubhouse.  The services of the SA Golf Association’s architect Mr Murray Crafter were employed.  The new course was opened for the 1973 season.  A tree planting program then initiated is continuing; 100 trees are now growing and another 400 are planned.  A grant to partly fund the clubhouse was obtained from the State Government’s Parks and Reserves Committee.  Foundations were laid last May and completion will be in the next two weeks.  The Savings Bank of SA has granted a $9,000 loan to complete the project.
