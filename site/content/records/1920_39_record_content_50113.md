Tennis

Burra Association

Aberdeen II 14-103 defeated Ironmine 4-95

Kooringa I 10-88 defeated Aberdeen I 8-87

Croquet. Aberdeen v. Kooringa.  The results seem to me, judging from the names, to give Kooringa 3 games and Aberdeen nil.

Burra Town Council, Special meeting last Thursday to consider Sunday games.

The Tennis Association had written asking if the agreement with the Kooringa Club and its prohibition of Sunday play extended also to the Aberdeen courts.  It said three days were needed for the tournament.

Cr Dow said a special letter had been sent to the Kooringa Tennis Club a couple of months previously emphasising the agreement again in terms of Good Friday and Sundays.

Cr Kellaway asked about the Aberdeen Club – he did not think the agreement there mentioned Good Friday or Sundays.

The Mayor said they had shut their eyes to play on Good Friday for the past 9 years.

Cr Dow said they had recently emphasised it in a letter.  He said the agreement must be stuck to until it is replaced.

The Mayor said to Cr Dow: You are not against playing on Sunday are you?

Cr Dow said: Certainly not, or Good Friday either.

The Mayor then said: It is open to you to move a resolution.

Cr Dow moved to scrap the requisite clause.

Cr Riggs said he believed the whole question was raised to introduce Sunday tennis and Councillors were not there to be dictated to by a few tennis players.

The Mayor wanted to see a successful carnival and if it came to his casting vote he would support deleting Good Friday from the agreement.

Cr Kellaway seconded Cr Dow’s motion.

Cr Bevan wanted to defer the matter; believing strings were being pulled that were undermining the Council’s dignity.

A good deal of bickering then followed.

Cr Dow said he was against organised Sunday sport, but was also against an interdict on any section of the community having personal recreation as they desire.

Cr Kellaway suggested a notice of motion for next meeting concerning the sale of the land.

The Mayor couldn’t see how that would help the carnival.

Cr Kellaway said it would save a lot of hullabaloo if Council moved to suspend the agreement.  He favoured allowing play on Good Friday.  The motion was lost.

Cr Kellaway then moved that Council would have no objection to the carnival being carried on as arranged on Kooringa courts.  Cr Dow seconded, remarking that this had the same effect as his motion.  This was carried unanimously.

The Youth Occupational Committee will inaugurate its classes after Easter.

Ironmine Methodist Church held its 63rd anniversary 18 & 19 March.  Rev. D.G. Longbottom of Kingston was the preacher.
