Dr Evinta Emilianous (Dr Evinta) has begun consulting at the Burra Medical Centre.  She will attend emergencies and accidents at Burra hospital along with Doctors Dissanayake and Fernando.  They will also attend to nursing home care.  This comes after a hiatus of 16 months when emergencies were treated by triage nurses with assistance from Clare doctors.  Dr Evinta comes to Australia from Sri Lanka and since her arrival has been working with the Rural Doctors Worrkforce Agency to gain full registration.  Dr Evinta has already joined the Burra Uniting Church and is looking forward to getting to know members of the community.  [Photo of the three doctors.]
