The Ulysses Motorcycle Club Odyssey event was at Burra for the weekend.  Some 350 members attended, hosted by the Torrens Valley Branch of the club.  They were welcomed by locals and when they had trouble with their bandâ€™s equipment, a group of locals got together and played for them.  The audience was most appreciative and combined to raise $600 for them.  The event also made more than $4,000 profit, which will be divided among Burra charities.  The club had booked out Paxton Square and other accommodation.  The club was formed in 1983 for people over 50 with a common interest in motorcycles.
