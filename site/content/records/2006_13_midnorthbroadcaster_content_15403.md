BCS Students will participate in a ‘Run Around the World’ event today as one of six schools in the Yorke and Mid North Region to take part in the first National Health and Physical Education Day.  The aim is to run the same distance as the earth’s circumference of 40,000 km.  40,000 students will each walk, jog or run at least 1 km.  It will be an R012 event involving approximately 235 students.  To date 526 schools are registered for the event in Australia and they are on track to run three times the earth’s circumference.
