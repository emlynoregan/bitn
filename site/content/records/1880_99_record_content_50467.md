St Mary’s.  The laying of the foundation stone of St Mary’s schoolroom by Mrs J. Lewis is reported in ⅔ column.  The committee on the project was Rev. A.G. King, Dr Sangster, Messrs E.C. Lockyer, R.M. Harvey & C. H. Ewins.  Messrs Launder & Pearce got the contract for £463.  At 3 p.m. Rev. King addressed the congregation.  Mrs J.C. Sandland presented the stone in memory of her late son: Robert Chester Sandland.

Rev. King acknowledged this and the gift of Allan Cooper Sandland, youngest son of Mr Thomas Sandland, who had departed but was a former scholar of the school.  Under the stone were laid the Parish Magazine, current number of the Church Review, Burra Record & SA Register and a list of all those associated with the building.  A collection was taken while all sang Onward Christian Soldiers.
