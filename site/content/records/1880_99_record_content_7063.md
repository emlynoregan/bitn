Editorial on The Burra Mine.

For some months Captain Killicoat and John and Charles Drew have been negotiating with SAMA for the lease and prospective sale of the Burra Mine, but discussions broke down last week.

Some months ago the news it had been sold to English capitalists was greeted with pleasure and an early resumption of work was hoped for.  Disappointment followed.

The discussion above was an offer to lease for 21 years for a 5% royalty and right to purchase the mine property during the first five years for £30,000.  The company has for a long time valued the asset on its balance sheet at £25,000 so this would seem a good offer.  Money was believed to be on hand to develop the mine so the offer was substantial.  The benefit to the town in employment is obvious.  Had a great discovery been made SAMA would still have benefited from the royalty, the increase in value of the town, which they still own, and mineral rights over about 10,000 acres of the special survey.

The impression is growing that the mine will never be worked again by the present company and it is disappointing to see the company make no endeavour to meet would-be purchasers on a fair basis.
