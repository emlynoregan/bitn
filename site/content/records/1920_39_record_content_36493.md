Burra Mine

Alf Walker, Hon. Secretary of Burra Mine Unemployment Committee reports that 60 men have handed in their names and 44 are presently at work.  They have struck good ore, but the difficulty is that the best ore is on a level with the water line.  The Minister of Mines will be asked to provide a pumping plant.
