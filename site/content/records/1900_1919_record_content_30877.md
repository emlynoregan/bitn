Obituary – Inquest.  At 9 o’clock Tuesday night 28 November W.J. Richards was driving Mrs Richards and two lady friends to the hospital to enquire about the health of their child.  Near the hospital the car ran over a small girl, Jessie Bowen, daughter of Mr E. Bowen of Kooringa, killing her almost instantly.  [Jessie May Bowen born 27 May 1906 at Kooringa.]

The inquest was held on Wednesday by J. McLaren JP.

Rev. S.J. Bloyd was at the site of the accident fixing up his own car on the side of the road.  Richards, he said, was driving slowly and the lights were on and the car was on the correct side of the road.  After the car had passed he saw something on the road and thought it had fallen from the car.  It was the body of a child.

Mr Richards said he did not notice any bump or anything wrong.

The other children said that as the car approached one of them advised another to run across the road.  Deceased fell in the middle of the road and was struck when she was getting up.

The verdict was that the child Jessie Bowen’s death had been caused accidentally and there was no blame attachable to anyone.
