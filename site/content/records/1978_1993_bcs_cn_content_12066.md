John G. Reed writes re a public meeting recently.

At the meeting he was disappointed to find references to ‘fly-by-nighters’.  He makes the point that while there are people who have lived in Burra all their lives and have dedicated much time to the community; it is also true to say that many local organisations are dependent on the time and service given by the so-called ‘fly-by-nighters’ – the teachers, police officers, stock agents, bank staff and so forth.  His views are supported by a note signed by Colin J. Fidock and Roger C. Henderson.
