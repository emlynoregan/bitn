‘Pro Bono Publico’ complains that:

Copperhouse school children are placing fencing wire in the way of a lady cyclist near Austin’s Corner past the railway station.

The Council has done nothing to repair a dangerous washaway near the same spot which caused an accident to Mr W.A. Rabbich who was pitched out of his cart.
