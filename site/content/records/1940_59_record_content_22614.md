Uranium was apparently discovered at Mt Painter in 1911 by an old Burra identity, Mr Bentley Greenwood.  Mt Painter is some 400 miles north of Adelaide in the Flinders Ranges and is said to have uranium in large quantities, making it potentially of great value to SA.  This week Mr R. Fuss came into the office with a small tin containing some of the ore from which uranium is extracted.  He said the ore had been brought from Mt Painter by his father, the late Mr Charles Fuss.  Charles Fuss was very interested in geology and any sort of mining and made frequent trips to the northern areas in pursuit of his hobby.  On one occasion he brought back the sample mentioned.  The ore is in greenish yellow flakes or crystals.  The late Mr Fuss sent some of the ore to Douglas (now Sir Douglas) Mawson, who became extremely interested in the deposit and visited the field.  An article in Smithâ€™s Weekly of 28 February 1931 said that the Mt Painter deposit was extensive and valuable.  Together Sir Douglas, Mr Fuss and Mr Bentley formed a company and Sir Douglas is reported to have stated that these extensive low grade deposits could produce large profits when concentrated.  The company did considerable development work and then WWI broke out.  Sir Douglas was in Antarctica and probably due to wartime difficulties the company went into liquidation even though at the time there was a good lode showing.  Last Thursday, just before the news about the new use for uranium was published, Mr R. Fuss presented the Adelaide University, through Sir Douglas Mawson, with a collection of specimens that his late father had brought from Mt Painter on several of his trips.
