Acting Premier, Mr Butler & Chief Secretary Mr Bice visited Burra on Wednesday and the Mayor, Mr McLaren, took them to the school where the lighting problems were discussed.  They then went to the Kooringa Police Station where the need for a verandah and another building was pointed out.  After that they went to the Hospital where the buildingâ€™s age and origin was explained.  The Kooringa Ward was the main problem, having been built after the main building as a dance hall and it was in a dangerous condition, especially with respect to the ceiling and one of the walls.  The Board proposes demolishing and rebuilding the ward to fit in with the W.H. Duncan Wing.  They consider the rest of the building would stand for years.  Mr Butler admitted that immediate alterations were necessary and thought the plan was reasonable.  He will take it to Cabinet.
