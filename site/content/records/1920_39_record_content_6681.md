Local Board of Health

Dr Ashton wrote saying the disease referred to last meeting in a patient he sent to the hospital was acute pharyngitis and the swab results were negative.

Cr Kellaway said this did not alter the fact that the hospital was given no indication whether the child should be isolated or not.

The Town Clerk said Dr Ashton had been notified accordingly.

The Mine Pool water is to be tested for safety for swimming.
