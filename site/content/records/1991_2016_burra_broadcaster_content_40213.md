Clean Up on ‘Aleppo Day’.  Alleppo Pines are spreading rapidly on the Mine Reserve and elsewhere in Burra.  Bob Perry of the Burra CMC is urging an attack on them as part of Clean Up Australia Day on 1 March 2015.  The CMC is offering a $150 prize for the biggest load of Alleppos delivered to the Burra Transfer Station between 2 and 4 p.m. on 1 March.
