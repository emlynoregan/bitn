SA Mining Association.  The Association’s AGM will be held today.

SA Mining Association

In the London Mining Journal of 25 December:

The directors of the Burra Burra Mine have declared a third dividend; the two former were each 50% on the paid up capital, while the third was 100%, thus repaying the shareholders the amount of paid up capital and then giving them a bonus of the same amount.  The£5 shares have been difficult to purchase at £120.

What will they say in England when publicity is given to two dividends of 200% each, since paid out by the Burra Burra directors.

Sales of Burra Burra ores as reported from Swansea for 23 December in the Mining Journal of 1 January 1848 amounted to 344 tons for £7,733-5-6.  The largest parcel of 280 tons averaged £24-2-3 per ton.  The average price obtained for the copper ores of Cornwall in the last quarter of 1847 was £5-10-6 per ton.
