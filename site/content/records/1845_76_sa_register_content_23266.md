Captain Hart addressed the crowd.  [He began with a conventional lot of platitudes before any policy statements.]  He favoured a tramway to unlock the mineral wealth of the Far North.  He wanted a more liberal Land Act to reflect the depressed economy of the times.  He was against changes to the Real Property Act.
