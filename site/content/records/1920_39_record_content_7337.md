Parliamentary Party Visits Booborowie.

The Parliamentary Bowls Team visited Booborowie while they were here:

Hon. T. Pascoe, Minister for Agriculture

Hon. J.H. Cooke

Hon. H. Tassle

Hon. G.H. Prosser

Senator E.C. Vardon

Senator Col. Rowell CB, VD

E. Anthony MP

T. Hawke MP

G.F. Jenkins MP

J. Field, Secretary for Lands

V. Ryan of the Tourist Bureau

In the last year or two a number of large land owners have increased the size of their holdings at the expense of small landowners.  Mr Warnes showed his fly trap â€“ a poisoned sheep carcase enclosed in wire netting and a hay press.  They inspected the Government Farm.  Mr Warnes hosted lunch at the Booborowie Hotel.  There were speeches during which Mr Warnes said that on his 134 acres he ran 1,000 sheep on the natural grasses in winter and fattened 4,000 in the lucerne season.  The district needed the rail connection with Hanson.  After lunch they inspected the Booborowie Memorial Hall.
