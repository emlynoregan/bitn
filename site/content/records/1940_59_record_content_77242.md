Poliomyelitis Mobile Unit

The Department of Health advises that its mobile unit will be in Burra and District in May.  School children will be immunised at their schools.  Infants and expectant mothers can attend selected centres only.  In Burra this will be at the Primary School.  The units have a tight schedule and it is important people attend at the times specified. Such mothers who cannot get to selected centres will be accepted at schools, but only if they are ready when the unit arrives, so the schedules can be maintained.  [These time are printed along with the times set aside for pre-school children and expectant mothers.]
