Editorial on the Mayor’s refusal to call a public meeting.

Of course it is his privilege, but it does strengthen the position of the requisisitionists

Had he simply said no, no one could have said much, but by giving his reasons he invites criticism in every paragraph.

He sees no reason to comply, but 21 gentlemen though otherwise.

He says no good could result; the action is in accordance with the majority of ratepayers.

But the meeting might adopt one of two courses: -

It could approve the Council action.

It could demonstrate the unwisdom of proceeding and bring about the rescission of the resolution.

Parliament is often influenced by public meetings and outside discussion and Council is not greater than Parliament.

Surely not half a dozen ratepayers in East Ward would agree with the work, so it is useless to speak of the wishes of the majority of the ratepayers when it is East Ward that is to bear the cost.  No one knows better than the Mayor how the other councillors have exulted over the two East Ward representatives in this matter.
