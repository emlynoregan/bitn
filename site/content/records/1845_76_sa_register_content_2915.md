We confess ourselves unable to account for this undignified and somewhat puerile act of retaliation.

We can hardly think these gentlemen believe that this withdrawal would alarm us into abandoning our duty to the public at large.  Do the Directors think that repressing adverse opinion would promote the interests of the Association?  Is this personal pique, or were the shareholders at their last meeting called upon to support this action?

We will not barter away the right to the free expression of our honest convictions, as public journalists.

But this is not the only pecuniary penalty to which we are to be subjected.  Noting less than our utter ruin will satisfy them.

To the inadvertent publication of an objectionable phrase in the letter of a correspondent, though we know not why they should suppose for a moment that it was intended to apply to them, we have offered an ample apology elsewhere.  Without any demand for an apology or explanation, and even after an apology has been known to have been offered, nine actions have been commenced against us, one at the suit of each Director.
