Obituary.  Thomas Palmer Goodridge who died 24 January was born at Hinton Martle in Dorset, England in April 1852 and came to Australia with his parents when 12 in the Sir John Lawrence.  He was apprenticed at 16 to W. Uhllmann as a butcher and later worked for the late G.A. Gebhardt.  He then worked for farmers and at 24 married Miss Elizabeth Whellum of Black Springs and returned to butchering, working for W. Symons and M. Symonds.  In 1891 he went to live at Gum Creek with his father.  He took little part in public affairs, but had at one time been a Councillor on the Hanson DC.  He was a keen gardener and supporter of the Ironmine Methodist Church.  He leaves a widow, one son and two daughters: T.E. Goodridge (Gum Creek), Mrs H. Gilbert (Black Springs) & Mrs P.
