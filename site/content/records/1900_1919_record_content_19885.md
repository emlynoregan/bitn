Obituary.  Grace Richards, relict of the late Thomas Richards and sister of Messrs William and W.H. Prior of Baldina, died last week at Broken Hill.  She lived in Burra with her husband in the early days of the town.  [This may be incorrect.  A Grace Prior born 16 October 1844 married John Richards in 1861 and would appear to be the person dying in 1907.  W.H. Prior had two sisters called Grace, both of whom died aged 8 months in 1866 & 1869 respectively.   If ‘the early days of the town’ means anything then Grace Prior hardly fits and we may be faced with Grace Gilbert or Gilbart who had children in the District of the Murray in 1849 & 1851 and was married to Thomas Richards!]
