Maureen Wright explains in a letter the financial arrangements of the Antique Fair.  Each year up to $5,000 is spent on advertising.  About $1,000 of this comes from local traders in sponsorship.  Entertainment and equipment hire costs about $3,000.  The co-ordinator receives $1,000 and other payments go to door staff, cr√®che and security.  In all the committee has a budget of about $11,000.  This year with other expenses the profit will be about $400.  The committee is a non-profit organisation and a sub-committee of the Burra Traders Assoc.  Any profit generated so far has gone into the Burra Antique Fair bank account as security against a bad weekend.  Ultimately we hope to be able to support other community events.
