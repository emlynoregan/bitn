Burra Rifle Club.  9th shoot for the Killicoat Trophy on 3 Jan. was postponed because the targets were out of order and again postponed on 7 Jan. due to dust making them invisible.  There is a rumour that the present range will be condemned as unsafe despite no problems in 8 years of use.  A new range is being made in J.C. Killicoat’s property, but it is too far to walk to and leaving the present range may be the death knell of the club.
