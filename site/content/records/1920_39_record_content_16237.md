Burra Town Council, 15 June.

The Lands Dept. wrote that all conditions for the closure of the School Quarry road had not been met and as it would cost a good deal the fencing of the quarry was an adequate alternative.  This was adopted.

The Council resolved to scarify and metal the main road from the post office to Fuss’s corner [St Just St] 20ft wide and 6 inches deep with a view to tarring it next year.  Work to begin 22 June.

Dead trees are to be replaced – this year they will have to be bought whereas previously they were available free.

‘Mt Task’ writes a letter of more than ½ column outlining a looming fight over opposing views on additions to the Farrell’s Flat Hall.

‘Observer’ writes complaining of those who play golf on Sunday.
