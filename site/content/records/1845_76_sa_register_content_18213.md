Election Meeting

Upwards of 150 persons gathered at the Burra Hotel on Tuesday 7 February to hear the views of the candidates for Parliament.  Mr T.S. Porter presided.

Mr Cole:

No other district has been more neglected in the mater of roads than the District of Burra.  He had supported extending the line of main roads to Mt Remarkable and Mt Bryan. (Though the Bill had failed.)  Up to 1860 not more than £130 had been spent on main lines of road in the District of Burra.  Since then £80 had been voted for a road through Kooringa.

He supported Mr Goyder’s fitness for the task of revaluing the runs and supported his reports.  If the leased were refused they should go to public auction and if there was no bid should be cut up into blocks for the convenience of purchasers.

He had opposed the vote of £50,000 for new Houses of Parliament.

Agricultural land should be opened up as required and not in large blocks – he thought the 80 acre system had worked well.  He favoured deferred payments for land.

He favoured the continuation of the ad valorem* duties.

He did not support the importation of miners.

[Ad valorem duties on imports: taxes paid in proportion to the estimated value of goods.]

Mr Neales:

The interests of the district had been neglected with respect to roads and it was more the fault of electors because they had failed to direct attention to the matter.

Goyder’s valuations had become the law of the land and he did not think many squatters would throw up their leases as a result.

It was useless to sell farmers land if roads were not provided for the movement of their produce.  A Bill had been passed in the House for borrowing £250,000 for roads, but the Upper House had thrown out the Road Bill so they had no machinery to work the money with.

He though new houses of Parliament could wait ten years.

He favoured ad valorem duties.

He considered the present mineral regulations unfair and disadvantaged miners in SA compared with other colonies.

[Both candidates then answered a series of questions from electors.]
