Obituary/Inquest.  On Monday at the White Hart Inn Dr Dashwood held an inquest on the body of an infant who had died that morning.  The inquest followed reports that the child had been starved and Dr Walls of Aberdeen entertained the opinion that death was due to want of proper nutrition.  The deceased was the illegitimate child of a married woman named Day, now away from Burra, who had engaged Mrs Foreman of Aberdeen as a wet nurse to look after it when it was a month old.  Mrs Foreman said it weakened although fed on arrowroot, maizena and occasionally suckled.  A few days before its death it was taken by Mrs Foy and seems to have existed on an occasional drink from any nursing mother who lived nearby.  Dr Walls said it had died from atrophy and he had seen children die from this cause even when given every attention and nourishment.  The verdict was death from natural causes, but the jury censured the mother for want of humanity in deserting her child.
