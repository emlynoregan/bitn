Mr G.C. Heinrich (84) took a short cut at the oval on Sunday evening and attempted to climb over the gate between the oval and the Small Bore Club Range.  He fell from the top of the gate and the cuff of his trousers caught on a spike, leaving him suspended upside down for several hours.  He spent a comfortable night in hospital, but was apparently not in bad condition.
