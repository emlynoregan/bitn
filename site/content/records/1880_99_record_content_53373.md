Obituary and Inquest.

Hilda Mann died as a result of a gunshot wound on Sunday.

Mr & Mrs Mann and family went to chapel except for Hilda aged 19 and Emma who stayed home to prepare dinner etc.  Hilda completed her work and went to the room of a lad named Karl Petergelt who was sewing his trousers.

Miss Mann picked up a gun which was loaded and the accident followed.  The lad immediately informed the parents and they returned to the scene and informed the police.

Frederick August Mann’s evidence confirmed the above account.

Carl Petergelt [sic] said he was sitting sewing when Hilda entered.  After a couple of minutes she took up the gun and asked if it was loaded, he said ‘very likely’.  He kept on sewing without looking at her and then the gun went off.  He picked her up and sat her on a box and went to tell her parents.

The verdict was that the death was purely accidental.

[Neither birth nor death appear to have been registered.]
