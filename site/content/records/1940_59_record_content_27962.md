Science Congress in Adelaide.  Delegates visited Burra on Saturday – they comprised Botanists, Geologists and Anthropologists.  They were given a Civic Reception in the Council Chamber by the Mayor.  He gave them an outline of Burra’s History.  They were then taken to see the Aboriginal rock carvings.  Mr A. Walker was one of the guides.  Mr T.H. Woollacott spoke in support of the Mayor.  They made their way to Deep Creek where they inspected the carvings, which were outlined in chalk.  A picnic afternoon tea was provided by the Mayor & Mayoress.  The party then decided to make towards the main Baldina Road in a direct route.  The cars got safely over the creek, but the coach with the visitors got its rear caught on the bank with its rear wheels suspended in mid-air.  It took an hour of digging to free it with the aid of Mr Harry Mann, who lives nearby.  They proceeded to an old Aboriginal camping ground on the bank of Baldina Creek, where they found a good number of Aboriginal implements.  Some were of stone foreign to this country – some from stone found only in the Northern Territory, suggesting the area was a trading ground.

Persons desirous of visiting the carvings can find them near Mr H. Mann’s homestead.  Drive to within about a quarter of a mile of the homestead and then hike across the paddock to the creek on the left, where they can be seen on flat rock slabs in the creek bed and on the sides of the creek.  The camping ground is on the right, just as one passes over the ford at Baldina Creek and it extends a considerable distance.
