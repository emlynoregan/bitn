Burra Waterworks.  Mr E.C. Sedgeman is running the water supply with no problems and with less trouble with the new engine.  Still there is plenty of work to be done outside, so two drivers are permanently kept.  The Government now also takes the water [for the SAR] and the quality is said to be much better than in the old well.  The pumping station has been moved to the late Joe Ford’s property, which the Government bought.
