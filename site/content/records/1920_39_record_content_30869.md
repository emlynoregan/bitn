Frank Treloar: Looking Back (Continued)

Negotiations were taken up with the Patent Copper Co. for smelting.  They sent out Gregory Seal Walters to investigate the feasibility of setting up a smelter.  He arrived in September 1848.  He came back to Burra in November and then went to the head of Gulf St Vincent to seek a practical route to export the copper.  Gavin Young, surveyor, was engaged to mark a suitable track for bullock teams and this was done by mid-November 1848.  The route and loading area at the port were both successful and in late November 1848 arrangements were completed for smelting at Burra once the furnaces had been built.  In the meantime it was arranged that the Patent Copper Co. would buy SAMA’s copper on an assay basis for transhipment via the Gulf.  The Smelting Works were erected on a site with a 99-year lease which was later bought outright.  The route was through Mintaro, Auburn, Skilly’s Creek, Hurd’s Hill, Hope’s Plain, Devil’s Garden and Dunn’s (Balaklava) to Pt Wakefield.  Hundreds of bullock teams were ultimately involved.  A bridge was built at Dunn’s across the Wakefield River.  Mr Henry Pinch was the blacksmith on the work and R.H. Bruce of Kooringa’s father was in charge of the company’s stock yards and looked after the interests of teamsters.  SAMA was busy erecting small cottages for miners.  Treloar thinks these were on the block of land opposite the hospital used recently (1929) by Mr Parks for dog kennels.  Others were built on the top side of Paxton Square.  The good stone cottages forming Paxton Square were put up later and will be mentioned in a later article.

The Smelting Company took bricks from John Bagg who was well advanced in supplying bricks for mine use.  Goats were being kept for milk and by this stage there were 600 in the town and they were teaching people to swear.  They wandered freely over the hills.

Steam was needed to replace the horses.  Mr Spraggs was appointed chief engineer.  In preparation SAMA contracted for 50 loads of firewood at 12/6 for a 30cwt load of mixed sheoaks and gum.  Soon after contracts of 200 and 100 tons were let for 7/- a ton.  The engine and boilers arrived and began work on 21 October 1849.  SAMA then explored for copper on what became Koonoona Estate.  100 tons of good ore from a promising show was sent away in 1849 and it was called Karkulta Mine, for which great hopes were entertained.  In Burra the hopes for growth caused the survey of Aberdeen, but its sale in September 1849 was not a success and only about £608 worth was sold and a few blocks were sold later.  Long poles came to the mine from White’s Forest and sawn timber from J. Hour, David Davis, John Thomas & Wright of Penwortham, Skilly & Watervale.  Hay was brought in from as far as Gawler.  A boy was killed underground.  Dan O’Leary applied for a block to start a tannery and Joseph Ford asked to lease 40 acres to start a market garden, but these were refused because the land might be needed for mining.  The Bible Christian Trustees were granted a block to erect a place of worship in a corner of Paxton Square (now [1929] occupied by Mr Luke Day).  Up to 300 tons of ore was now weekly being sent to the Gulf.
