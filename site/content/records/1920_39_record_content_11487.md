SA Supreme Court

Drew & Crewes Pty Ltd v. Bennett & Fisher Ltd.

There is a fairly complex judgement of the Supreme Court on an appeal the dismissal of a case in the Local Court at Redruth.

The plaintiff claimed Â£199 damages alleging the defendant sold sheep which were the property of the plaintiff.  The appeal was dismissed and the decision of the Local Court was upheld with the plaintiff to pay costs.

This was quite a technical case in which Drew & Crewes believed they had ownership rights over sheep that a Mr P.E. Jenkins had subsequently sold through Bennett & Fisher and the proceeds of which had been credited to his account with that firm.  Drew & Crewes failed to establish an immediate right of possession and also failed in how they set about the case.
