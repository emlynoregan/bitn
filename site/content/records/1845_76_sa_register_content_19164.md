The Past Year.  Editorial

The year just ended has been marked by a terrible drought in pastoral areas and poor crops in the agricultural areas.  Operations at the Great Burra Mine have been brought almost to a standstill and exports declined dramatically.  Despite this the colony has weathered the storm and the treasury is in a flourishing state.  Customs revenue has risen and land sales brought in more than £500,000.  People continue to have faith in the colony.  If Burra languishes there is Moonta to take its place.  [The editor goes on to discuss Goyder’s characterisation of the land beyond his line and believes there will prove to be great pastoral land in the far northeast.  He fears the other colonies are pursuing policies that will do more to attract settlers than SA’s policies.]

In 1865 SA obtained something like a charter of rights in the shape of an Act of the UK Parliament declaring that Colonial Legislators may pass laws for local government without the feat of having them set aside on technical grounds.  Education is being well attended to.  The colony remains deficient in theatres, art galleries etc.  The criminal records are as free as usual from very serious offences.  Employment has been plentiful and wages good, although the price of food has been high.  Copper prices fell, but rose again by the year’s end.  The present crop seems likely to give a fair yield.
