Mongolata Goldfield

W. Williams of Parkside visited the mines last week and is optimistic that the field will do well if properly worked.  He is a former manager of leading WA goldfields.  He was born in Burra and left with his parents 74 years ago when only 10 months old.  He says the gold at Mongolata is similar to that of the Rand in South Africa.

Although aged 75 Mr Williams is a man of remarkable personality and build and it is to be hoped he will be spared to see the fruition of his present intense interest in Mongolata.  If the field were in WA he believes it would before now have had 2,000 men employed there.  He is a consultant for Byles’ GM Co. and expects to see a marked development in a few months.

[The commonness of the name makes identification uncertain, but Mr Williams may have been William Williams born 9 December 1860 at Kooringa to David & Hannah Williams, nee Clark.]
