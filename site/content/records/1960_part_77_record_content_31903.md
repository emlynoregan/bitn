St John Ambulance is to undertake a state-wide campaign to raise funds for a building campaign.  The aim is to place everyone in the settled areas within 30 minutes of an ambulance.  Burraâ€™s new ambulance is expected to arrive this month.  In 1962 $208,000 was raised.  The target this time is for $200,000.  The Government will offer a dollar for dollar subsidy.
