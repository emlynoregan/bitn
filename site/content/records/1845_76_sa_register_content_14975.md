SA Mining Association.  [Editorial] The half-yearly report of the Directors was read an adopted at the meeting on Wednesday.  The Directors regretted that they could not report such an abundant yield of copper as in past similar periods.  This is due to a reduction in the number of men employed rather than a decline in the quality of the ores raised.  The total raised in the six months to 30 September last was 5,133 tons of the usual average percentage of copper; c. 22%.  This is a reduction of about 1,100 tons compared with the previous six months.  There has also been a falling off in the value of copper during this period.  Six months ago the price was £95 per ton and twelve months ago sales were effected at £105 per ton.  In the last two months only £85 had been realised at Adelaide, though this had recently risen to £90 per ton.  We may hope that this signals and end to the decline.

The gross quantity of ore raised in the year to 31 March 1861 was 12,237 tons at a cost of £138,299-4-11 or £11-9-0 per ton.  This realised £154,897-16-1 or £12-13-2 per ton, leaving a profit of £16,598-12-0 or £1-7-2 per ton.  This is the smallest profit hitherto obtained.

The Directors have declared a dividend of 100% for 4 December next and have an estimated undivided profit of £21,493-16-1 based on the prices of copper ruling in England and India at the last mail.  With increased prices in prospect the next half-yearly report may be expected to be as favourable as any of its predecessors.
