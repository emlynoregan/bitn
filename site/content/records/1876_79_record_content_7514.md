Mr Lipsett wondered if the loss was as little as £14 [i.e. £2 from the general funds and £12 from the cemetery funds] when he had heard it was much more. Dr Nesbitt said the loss was in fact confined to £14 in cash, but there was also a loss in interest of £10. Mr Lipsett asked the auditors to explain, before they sought re-election, why they had not found out the problems at the first instance. Mr Cave said that in going through the books they had found a certain sum not accounted for amounting to between £50 &£60 and there were two items for which there were no vouchers.
