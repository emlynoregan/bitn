Court.

‘Joseph Ford was charged on the information of J. Morgan with unlawfully depasturing sheep on Crown Lands.  Plea not guilty.  Francis Ford said he gave instructions to Ah Shang to drive sheep from the station to Wandillah paddock, but the sheep got boxed with others.  Ah Shang, who didn’t know the Bible from any other book, and didn’t seem to display any anxiety about being sworn, said – I go along a road, see, sheep get em mix, see, doon no ’ow get em box long other sheep, see. Sheep go away from Misr. Ford’s 8 or 10 o clock, cum back by-and-by 4 or 5 o’clock.

The Bench thought they had enough evidence from Ah Shang to inflict a penalty of £1 and costs.
