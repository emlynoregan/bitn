Letter to Editor.

Cr Ridgway writes re the recent elections, accusing last week's writer of being both libellous and impertinent. While sympathising with the South Ward for their predicament he denies it is any of his doing. Mr Geake's failure to be returned had nothing to do with him. He did not go into Mr Geake's shop to borrow the book containing the laws of the Corporation and did not know that Mr Geake had withdrawn until after the closing of nominations. He would be quite happy to see him on the Council. He regrets that the ratepayers were left without a choice in the matter. On the 20' November he performed the duties imposed on him to the best of his abilities without fear or favour.
