Pigmy Bluetongues should benefit from improved grazing following a habitat protection project funded by the Federal Government’s Caring For Our Country Program.  The lizard was once thought extinct until found in 1992 in grasslands in SA’s Mid North.  Land owners who have Pigmy Bluetongues on their property are encouraged to attend a free grazing workshop being delivered by the Mid North Grasslands Working Group or to have a free grazing management plan developed for their property.  They will be able to apply for funding to implement grazing management plans.  The survival of the lizards depends on people managing grasslands sustainably.  The bonus for landowners is that sustainable grazing can also improve the productivity of their properties.
