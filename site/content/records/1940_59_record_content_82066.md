Murray Water.  It is understood that following a request for Murray water a supply has been granted, to be delivered by a spur line from tanks at Hanson.  Work is expected to begin in 1960, or at the latest in 1961.  The new line north of Hanson will serve those parts of SA suffering severe shortages of water and will run north along the ranges to near Booleroo Centre to serve the country east of the ranges.
