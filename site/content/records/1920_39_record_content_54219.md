Mr & Mrs Bob Tanner the late manager at Braemar Station were given a farewell there.  They have decided to purchase a property of their own.  About 50 people assembled for the occasion and the social was held in the large woolshed â€“ a standing relic of past prosperous days when many thousands of sheep were shorn there annually.  Dancing was enjoyed interspersed with songs and recitations.  A presentation was made to Mr & Mrs Tanner and also one to Fred Miller the mailman.  A sumptuous supper was provided by the ladies.
