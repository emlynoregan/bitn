The Director of Mines writes explaining why WA conditions for the unemployed are not adopted in SA.  [Several not very persuasive reasons are given, but two perhaps had more validity.  One was that many of the Mongolata miners were inexperienced compared with those in WA and consequently it was prudent to be more restrictive in supplying explosives.  Secondly in Mongolata the area of productive gold was quite small and that area was already being exploited.  There have been no significant discoveries elsewhere on the field.  The implication was clearly that the Department thought it a waste of money and resources to encourage prospecting where there was little chance of success.]
