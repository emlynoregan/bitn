Obituary.  Mrs J. Fitzgerald of Kooringa died at her residence on 24 February aged 93.  She was born at Tipperary in Ireland 12 August 1833 and left Plymouth in the Stamboul in October 1857 with her husband and two children, arriving at Pt Adelaide in February 1858.  She came to Burra by coach, which was a disaster as the coach capsized and one of her children was fatally injured.  She was a keen gardener.  She was exceptionally well till getting influenza three months ago and breaking her hip on 17 February.  Her husband died 31 years ago. [Death registered as 25 February.  The birth registrations of her children in SA give her maiden name as variously Johanna Widaro, Witheroe or Wethere.  James Fitzgerald aged 11 months died at Kooringa 24 February 1858.]]

She spent her final years with her daughter Mrs M. Dawe and her second son (unmarried), Mr T. Edward Fitzgerald.  Her other children were Mr John Fitzgerald (Ceduna), William Fitzgerald (Adelaide), Mrs E.J. Bradley (Unley) and Mr H. Fourier [sic: error for Mrs H. Foureur] (Mitcham).  She was a devoted member of St Joseph’s Church.
