Explosives

A quantity of explosives that had been stored for about 20 years in Burra was determined to be dangerous and has been destroyed under the supervision of the Chief Inspector of the department of Chemistry in Adelaide.  Approximately 3Â½ pounds of gelignite and one pound of blasting powder with fuses and detonators was involved.  Sergeant McGrath warned people that stored explosives can become highly dangerous and people should only obtain what they need and not store it at all.
