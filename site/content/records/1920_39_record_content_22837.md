Burra Races last Wednesday were well-patronised and arrangements were excellent.  There was unfortunately a rather large number of late scratchings, which seems to be a common feature these days of country meetings resulting in small fields.  The Burra Cup was the main race and was won by J. Saleebaâ€™s brown gelding Trionit aged 6 years and ridden by G. Mules.
