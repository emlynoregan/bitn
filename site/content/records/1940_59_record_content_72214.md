Improvements at the school in the past year included extending the yard and the erection of a new eastern fence.  Negotiations are being held to have much of the yard asphalted in the coming year.  Existing asphalt has been top dressed.  Arbor Day was held and the school has many young trees being cared for by the children as part of their education.  The first picnic for many years was held at Gum Creek and was voted a great success.  During the year the school staged a fine concert.
