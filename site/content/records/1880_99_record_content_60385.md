Vermin Fencing in the N-E.

A meeting of leaseholders of land in County Burra and County Kimberley (and some to the east of that) was held at Murkaby on Tuesday 28 July.  Mr H.S. Dunn took the chair with C.B. Warnes as secretary.  Those present were anxious to have a vermin proof fence erected to protect their holdings from rabbits and wild dogs coming from the unused country beyond them to the boundary of the colony and north of the River Murray.  It was decided after discussion that it was desirable to erect a line to extend from the River Murray to the vermin fence already erected in the north.

The route arrived at was from the river along the eastern boundary of Hundred of Stuart and thence north varying as necessary to include the holdings of Lockyer, Watson, Pens, Escott, Gibbes, G.G. Klemm and another piece of land and then north to a fence already erected within c. 6 miles of the northeast corner of County Burra.

The Government will be asked to erect the fence to be 70-75 miles long.  It would protect c. 160 [sic] square miles of country, none of it more than 20 miles west from the county line, while about 480 [square] miles lies east of it.

[The figure of 160 is clearly an error â€“ could it be 1,600?]
