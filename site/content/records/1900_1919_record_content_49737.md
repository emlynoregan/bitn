The Main Roads grant is for £400.

It was proposed to tar dress from the post office to Drew & Crewes’ corner and from Dalgety’s corner to across the Black Bridge.

Cr McBride objected – it was nonsense to put tar on a flat road that would not carry it.  He wanted the tar dressing postponed till they saw how it was done in the city.

Cr Harris moved that roads already tar dressed be redressed at once.  Carried.
