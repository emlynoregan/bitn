Burra Burra Show Inc. Sheep Dog Trials were held 1 & 2 April under unfavourable weather conditions.  There were no entries from Victoria this year.  Mr Arthur Riggs supplied the sheep.

Winners:

Local Class	T. Turner’s Donald

Maiden Stakes	T. Whittington’s Banner

Puppy Stakes	T. Whittington’s Banner

Open Class	F.R. Dinning’s Tatiara Lass

In the Flower Show it was a bit early in the season, but the quality was very good.  As most birds are moulting the poultry show was also limited in size.
