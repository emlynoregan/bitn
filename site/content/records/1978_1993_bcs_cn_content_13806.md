St John Ambulance Brigade

The Board entertained volunteers and their families at a Christmas Dinner at the Sports Complex on 1 December.  As Chairman of the Board, Mr Ron Thamm thanked volunteers.  A presentation was made to Richard Lockheed who is leaving due to a transfer in employment.

During the year Chris Muller and Ali Bennett were also lost due to employment transfers.  This leaves only 13 fully trained ambulance officers and an urgent call is made for people to come forward to increase the strength of the local division.
