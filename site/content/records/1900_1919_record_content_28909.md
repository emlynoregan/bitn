A Revolutionary Socialist.  A misguided youth who claimed this title arrived in town last week.  He took a stand in Market Square on an empty case and sacrificed commonsense and a large portion of the English language in an effort to give people an idea of economics etc.  His wild flights of fancy included what he wished to do or see done to capitalists, farmers, the Labor Party and in fact to all and sundry.  Some of his statements were so wild that Mr W.H. Hardy (as a public man) challenged him and pointed out the illogicality of his platitudes and the fact that his wilful and uncalled for remarks were a grave mistake if he was trying to convince a respectable audience.  He admitted mistakes in reference to the challenged statements, made an excuse of being tired and retired.
