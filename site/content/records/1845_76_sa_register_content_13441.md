Kooringa News, 16 May

The gold fever associated with the Snowy diggings is abating following dispiriting accounts from there.

On Sunday Messrs Klaer arrived with their Cani & Equi Drome and immediately prepared to entertain the town with an exhibition of their own wonderful gymnastic feats and the no less admirable sagacity of the dumb members of their troupe.  On Monday their pavilion was crowded with an assembly greatly appreciative of the truly clever performances of both man and beast.

On Saturday evening a meeting of woodcarters and others interested in the trade was held with the purpose of memorializing the Government to repeal the tax on the cartage of timber.  Several resolutions were passed and a memorial adopted and processes set in train to implement the motions.  Another meeting yesterday (Tuesday) resolved to request Mr Dale MO to present the memorial to Parliament.
