Hallett Wind Farm

The final lift for the first wind turbine took place on 1 March and it is now generating electricity while undergoing rigorous testing.  The remaining 44 towers and turbines will cover more than 14 km of Brown Hill ridge.  Each turbine will have a hub height of 80 m and a blade length of 44 m, with the potential to generate 2.1 MW.
