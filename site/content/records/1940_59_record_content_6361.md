A Social was held at Braemar Station on 28 June for Messrs Bob & George Gallagher who recently enlisted in the RAAF and AIF respectively.  They are two of the three sons of Mr George Gallagher of Pualco Station and grandsons of the late pastoralist Mr James Gallagher.  Both have spent the major part of their lives outback.  The social was held in the wool room.  Music was by Messrs J. Pens, Goss, McInerney and Gallagher.  There was a wonderful supper.  A presentation was made by Mr Ron Edington, manager of Braemar â€“ a handsome writing compact.  Mr Bert Cornelius also spoke.
