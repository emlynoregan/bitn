Easter at Burra.  Good Friday was pleasant and Easter Sunday was cloudy with a little evening rain, but on Monday there was thunder, an east wind and drizzle all day.  The Anglican Sunday School picnic to Princess Royal was postponed to Tuesday, when it was a success.  The Wesleyan Sunday School sports and picnic on Limestone Hill was converted to an indoor event.  The Roman Catholic Picnic was postponed to a day to be fixed.  On Monday Evening the Burra Christies gave a concert at the Burra Hotel to aid the Catholic Church and despite the weather it was a success.

Rev. L.W. Stanton presented a concert at the Burra Hotel Assembly Room on Tuesday.  This raised funds for firewood for the poor.

At the Bible Christian Anniversary Services the Tonic Sol-Fa Choir led by W. Davey, contributed greatly to the success of the occasion, which raised £40.

On Easter Sunday the Wesleyan Sunday School students sang their anniversary hymns and proceeds from this anniversary were c. £30.

Despite the steady rain there was only a little run-off and almost all the rain soaked in, giving an excellent start to the season and raising the spirits of farmers, graziers and tradespeople.
