Burra Town Council, 15 February

Senator McBride writes that he is taking up the matter of late notification of casualties with the Minister of the Army.

The minister of Railways writes that it is not practicable to open the Aberdeen Railway Quarry.  Not much ballast is being used, but when any large amount was required north of Burra the Aberdeen Quarry would not be forgotten.

The Mayor & Mayoress thanked the Council for its sympathy on the death of their son Noel Woollacott in New Guinea.

Cr Kellaway said the Institute appeared to believe their offer concerning the rent of the Council Chamber had been accepted, but this was not so.

Cr Harvey moved the Institute be advised the Council would stand by its previous offer of paying £36 per annum.  Carried.

A kerb is to be made to keep cars away from a neighbour’s fence at the Oddfellow’s Hall.
