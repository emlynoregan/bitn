Burra Mine Model

People who are interested in contributing to the making of the proposed model of the Burra Mine in the 1860s are asked to come forward and people or groups who are willing to sponsor a building or donate to the cost of a building are also sought.  A scale model of a horse whim is on display in the Community Library.  [Photo.]
