Working Men’s Blocks in the District:

Hundred of Kooringa: half the Police Paddock has been surveyed into five blocks and all taken up.  The supply is miserably inadequate.

Hundred of Ayers: the area is suburban to Booborowie with good soil and water (at 3-45’), but timber for fencing and firewood is scarce and there is no on site building material.

Hundreds of Kingston and Hallett: blocks are 2-5 miles north of Mt Bryan and 1-5 miles from Hallett on the TSR with good land and water at c. 30’.  Fruit, flowers, vines, and vegetables are being grown.
