Tornado.  Last week’s report suggested that the tornado was unique in the district, but a tornado hit the district in October 1915 and touched earth at ‘Mackerode’, the property of Mr Albert Gebhardt.  It half emptied a small dam, twisted large trees off at their trunks and sent a hay stack flying.

[In fact there are three reports of tornados in the local paper:

IV, 133, 14 Jan. 1881, page 2: a tornado hit Terowie.

XV, 956, 6 Sep. 1911, p.2: a tornado snapped off telegraph poles about a mile south of the Burra Railway Station.

XXXVIII, 48, 29 Nov. 1916, page 3: actually describes the event referred to above as October 1915.]
