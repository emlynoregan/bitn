Mr A.E. Smith MHR has undertaken to place an idea before the right authorities from his recent meeting with the Fathersâ€™ Association.  Mr George of Booborowie had suggested that Gift Duties etc. should be waived when the father of a returned serviceman desired to rehabilitate his son by giving him a parcel of land.
