Burra Show, 22 October

The entries were unprecedented with some 3,200 compared with 1,800.  It was a beautiful day and attendance was about the same as 1929.  It was cloudy with no wind and the rain held off till the next day.  Takings were down about Â£30, which is good considering the economic conditions.  The railcar from Adelaide was a financial success and from Riverton onwards many passengers had to stand.  There was no special from Terowie, but the East-West brought a few northern visitors.  Mrs J.B. Rowe of Kooringa again did the catering very well.  Results are printed pages 1 & 4.
