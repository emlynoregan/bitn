Kooringa Methodist Church Centenary

Monday last week at 5.30 the Ladies’ Guild put on a high tea and a very large crowd attended.  The official table included the Mayor & Mayoress (Mr & Mrs H.J.B. Jennison), the President of Methodist Conference (Rev. A.D. McCutcheon), Rev. J.P.H. Tilbrook, Rev. E. Lawson & Mrs Lawson & Rev. Hobbs (present minister: Revs Tilbrook & Lawson are past ministers), Rev. & Mrs Pitman (Burra North), Mrs I. Nankivell (Secretary of the Ladies’ Guild) & Captain McDonald (Salvation Army).

Rev. Hobbs gave a welcoming address and the Mayor made a short speech.  Rev. Lawson replied for the visitors.  After the tea a Civic Welcome was extended to the President of the Conference in the church by the Mayor.  He also introduced Mr G.S. Hawker MP who spoke.  The report on the church followed along with various choral items and addresses from Revs Tilbrook & McCutcheon.  Proceeds of the functions amounted to £52.
