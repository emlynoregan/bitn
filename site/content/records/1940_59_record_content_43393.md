Burra High School.  Mr J.S. Walker Inspector of Technical Schools opened the new classrooms on Tuesday.  More than 100 parents and friends gathered and two other inspectors, Mr Richards & Mr Polkinghorne.  The Headmaster Mr Pederick said they had applied for the rooms in 1947 and in June this year 8 returned soldiers under the Rehabilitation Training Scheme had come along and done an excellent job.  One will be a typing and library room and the other a classroom.  The L. Walker Memorial shelving had been expected, but had not arrived in time for the ceremony.

Mr Walker said the rooms had to come from the Loveday Prison Camp.  The Education Department had purchased about 38 of the buildings and 30 had become classrooms.  Mr Richards also gave a short address and Mr S. Woollacott from the High School Council moved the vote of thanks.  The Headmaster also thanked Mr E. Finch for donating a fine specimen cupboard of named geological specimens.
