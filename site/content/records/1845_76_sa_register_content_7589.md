Obituary/Inquest.  Death of the Discoverer of the Burra Burra Mine.

An inquest was held last Friday on the body of Thomas Pickett.  He had been engaged in cutting wood in the Murray Scrub for the Burra Copper Works.  He had come into Kooringa for the purpose of getting a settlement for his work.  He was last seen alive on Tuesday 18 November about 2 p.m. by James Norrell who is also cutting wood for the Copper Works.  He was then standing in the doorway of a vacant hut at Hallett’s Springs, about three miles from Kooringa.  Norrell spoke to him and found that he was drunk.  There was no evidence that he had then received any money from the Patent Copper Company or had money about him.  It was common for bullock drivers to stay at the old hut on their journeys and so Pickett’s presence there created no comment.  On Thursday 20 November at about 3 p.m. a young 10-year-old boy entered the hut seeking some twine for some childish purpose, and saw the deceased lying on the floor of the hut nearly naked and severely burnt.  He told his mother who lives in a hut on the opposite side of the creek.  The mother and two other women went to verify the report and told two men who were passing in a spring cart to inform the police.  From the position of the body and the medical testimony of Dr Bull, it was clear that the deceased had fallen into the fire while in a state of intoxication and that was the verdict of the jury.
