Redruth Methodist Sunday School held its Anniversary last Sunday and Monday.  Services were held as usual in the Memorial Hall and there were good congregations.  The preacher was Mr M.H. Thomas, Superintendent of Halifax Methodist Mission, Adelaide, assisted by Mrs Thomas.

The scholars’ tea on Monday night was held in perfect weather.  An innovation on this occasion was that the whole of the arrangements for setting out, waiting and washing up were done by the male officers and teachers of the Sunday school, who managed it all in a very proficient and professional manner, dressed in dark trousers, white shirts and black ties.

[Personal interest: among those listed was Ted Fuss.]

The handsomely decorated birthday cake was made by Mr Norrell Baynes, but it amazed everyone when it was cut and found to contain only sawdust: ‘Never judge a book by its cover.’

[Details of the Anniversary occupy ⅔ column.]
