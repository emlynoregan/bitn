Mid Northern District Methodist Synod sent a letter of congratulations to Mr E.W. Dunhill of Burra, who celebrates 70 years of active service as a local preacher of the Methodist Church.  He continues to preach with amazing vigour and earnestness and his remarkable memory allows him to preach without notes and to keep exactly to time.
