Ironmine Methodist Sunday School celebrated its Diamond Jubilee 25 & 26 September.  There were three services on Sunday and a great Methodist high tea on Monday.  The church had originally been a Primitive Methodist Church.  W.H. Lloyd is present superintendent and Lance Phillips the Secretary.  Of late a fine kindergarten hall has been built and further additions made in the last weeks.  [The report extends for 2⅓ columns.]

At the Reminiscent Meeting Mr Scott said he first came to Ironmine in late 1871 or early 1872, but was not at the first anniversary.  He said Mr T. Hutchins was the first Superintendent followed by Mr Bowen, Walter Fairchild and himself.  W. Fairchild said he first went to the Sunday school 57 years before.  George Goodridge looked back over 35 years and was a proud grandson of the late T. Hutchins, first Superintendent.  Over £18 was collected as a result of the jubilee services.
