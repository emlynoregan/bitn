Kooringa News, 21 August

Accident.  On 21 August an accident occurred on the macadamised road half way between the telegraph station and the Mine Store.  Mrs John Pearce and Mrs John Symons were in a spring cart driving towards Kooringa.  Mr Armstrong of Booborowie was coming the other way in a two-horse American trap.  When Mrs Pearce tried to pass on the wrong side of the road her horse shied and started up the hill, overturning the cart.  The occupants escaped with some rather severe grazes and a good shaking.

Surveyors have been busy the last few days, surveying the line of the contemplated railway.

The Cartapo cobalt discovery is being worked energetically.  William Davey has been appointed agent and is to go at once to the mine with eight miners to raise 100 tons of ore, which is to be sent to England as soon as possible.

The new mine found by Mr Patrick Murphy is also looking promising.

The Princess Royal Mine has recently been inspected by Captain Matthew Bryant.  Some of the ore has proved less rich than expected and this has caused dissatisfaction among the tributers.  But there is still some fine ore waiting at the Smelting Works.

A disturbance occurred recently between some men employed in building a stone wall around a portion of Dr Browneâ€™s Booborowie Run. There was a fight between a party of Irishmen and a party of Cornishmen, in which the Cornishmen were worsted.  It is likely to end up before the Local Court.
