Burra Town Council has endorsed the Mayor’s plan as announced.  The subscription list for the Mayor’s Fund is opened.

Mr Cave distributes his chrysanthemum slips this afternoon from the Institute and those seeking roots will be able to get them from his garden this morning.

Mr Wittber offers his services to give instruction free to young men and the Institute has offered the use of a room rent free for the evening class beginning 3 June.

Tree Planting.  About 250 new plantings have been made in the streets of Burra.  The ratepayers are asked to care for those near their premises while they are young.  Those cared for are five to six times the size of those neglected in the areas previously planted.

Methodist Union.  The Primitive Methodist, the Bible Christian and Methodist New Connexion Church have agreed upon a union to be known as The Methodist Church of SA.  A joint committee has recommended it and the union has been agreed to unanimously.  [But no timing for the actual merging is reported.]

Burra Institute monthly meeting of the committee took place and agreed to grant Mr Wittber the use of a room so he can offer a night class once a week gratis.  Starting 1st Friday in June 8-9.30 p.m.

Mr Holder sought the use of the hall free, for three concerts in aid of the Mayor’s Unemployment Fund.  This was considered and it was feared it would set a precedent, but was ultimately granted in the hope that such circumstances would never occur again.

The Women’s Queen Victoria Jubilee Fund seeks signatures from women on an address, which will be presented to the Queen.  Also they will be raising money, the object of which funds is yet to be decided.

J. Stuart Wayland, the Anglican incumbent, writes a letter expressing disappointment that the Institute is being used by Miss O’Gorman ‘whose mission is calculated to introduce religious discord and to fan the embers of religious hatred in this town’.  The committee has a by-law, which does not allow the hall to be used for religious purposes.  This has been enforced so why not in this case.  Is it a case of needing money, if so, ‘the depression has brought us very low indeed’.
