The Inspector visited 30 town [city] schools and 24 suburban ones and 24 country schools.  He reported the introduction of the principle of pupil-teachers (in two schools) with a fair degree of success.  This is to be encouraged because of the lack of efficient teachers.  This can only be addressed by importing them or training them.

The lack of school books has been addressed and a supply should arrive soon on the Albemarie.

The attendance of students has, as usual, been affected by their absence to take part in various kinds of labour and in a few schools by the presence of the epidemic, which has spread through the populated districts.

There is also a problem of the lack of teaching materials, long ordered from England, but not yet arrived.  The lack of school furniture is another problem.
