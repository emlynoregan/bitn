Robertstown Road from its junction with the Burra-Morgan Road is to be sealed.  Transport SA has it down to be done in two years’ time, but Goyder Council wishes to see it done in the 1998-99 financial year.  For this to happen Council would have to find the funding of some $3-$4 million and then be reimbursed by Transport SA in two years’ time.
