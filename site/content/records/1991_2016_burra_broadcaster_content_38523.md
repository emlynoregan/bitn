Mongolata Gold Mines

Reprinted from the Burra Record of 3 December 1930.

Since our last issue reports from Mr George Morgan’s Property are most healthy.  Samples we have seen, taken by Mr H.A. Byles from the property were studded with gold and subsequently must yield a hundred ounces to the ton.  These came from an old claim, originally taken out by a prospector named Bywater, some four to five years ago.  He has worked it intermittently, but not lately.  This claim has now been registered by H.A. Byles, who has worked it since 8 October.  The country is rugged and hilly.  Mr Byles’ party this recent weekend was successful in getting two big stones weighing 16-18 pounds, showing distinctly what is known as bar gold.

Mr Rampton is another prospector very satisfied with his claim.  There are currently 20 to 30 claims pegged out, but the difficulty is the lack of water, which has to be carted from Baldina Creek.  We hear there are good prospects in a couple of other shows.  The main gold has been found on the west side of the hill, but it is reported a prospector has found the metal on the east as well.  In WA many miners have found rich pockets and have jumped to the conclusion they have ‘found it’, only to see their finds quickly peter out.  However, the discoveries at so many places at Mongolata lead one to believe that something good has been struck.  We understand the geologist says that the specimens shown to him were the best he had seen in SA.  An interesting incident was related to us this week.  It seems Mr John Moulden, now of England (and a brother of Sir Frank Moulden), who is connected with BHP, was staying some twenty years ago with the late F.T. Jones, a former well-known Mongolata pastoralist.  Mr Moulder said in his opinion there was gold in three or four hills and took a number of samples to England for Assay.  This statement from such a high authority shows there is just reason for optimism.  The Misses Jones (late of Mongolata) are presently visiting the old country and are guests of Mr John Moulden.  The stones we have seen will be on view in Mr F. Harris’s window this morning.
