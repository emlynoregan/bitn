The Boy Scoutsâ€™ Concert on Tuesday is reviewed.  The show featured songs etc., but also scouting skills like signalling, rescue work and artificial respiration.  There were also skits featuring the Kaiser etc. and a short drama: The Scold, The Scoundrel and The Scout.

[Personal interest.  The cast included Norman Fuss, Russell Fuss and Vernon Fuss.]
