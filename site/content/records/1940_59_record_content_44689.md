Burra Bread.  Recent complaints about the quality of Burra bread caused the inspector E.R. Davey to visit the bakehouse.  He found conditions there to be clean and all in order.  Analysis of the flour has now revealed the presence of a bacterial germ known as Rope.  Mr Wilson of the Central Board     of Health has visited and has given advice on dealing with the problem.  The bacteria occur in all flour, but occasionally produce spores and germinate, contaminating the bread.  Vinegar is used to eliminate the bacteria from baking utensils.
