Obituary.  James Thomas, father of James Thomas, of Aberdeen and late of Wallinga Mt Bryan East, died at Burra hospital 21 December 1921 aged 84.

He was born at Forestgate Cornwall in 1837 and baptised in the Anglican Church at Redruth, Cornwall.  As a young boy he was sent to work in the Tresavane Mine and in 1848 the family sailed to Australia in the William Honey.  They came to Burra where he was set to work driving two horses at a water whim and then with a horse and dray.  Later he was a stockman looking after the mine horses.  He then drove bullocks for his father carting timber to the Burra Mine.  Still later he carted ironstone from Ironmine to the smelting works.  Eventually he got a holding at Mt Bryan and when this proved too small he moved to Banbury and then Mt Bryan East, where he lived for 40 years.  Many years ago he was a member of the Mutual Improvement Assoc. and he was fond of music and singing.  He was a founding member of the Hallett DC and had been a Chairman.  [Though not quite clear, the writer implies he had been a member of the Mt Bryan DC and perhaps the Burra DC as well.]  He married Miss [Mary] Pengilley [8 January 1859] of Kooringa, the daughter of Mrs William Penrose, who died some nine years ago.  He was a staunch supporter of the Mt Bryan East Methodist Church.  He is survived by three sons:  John Thomas, Rev. Joseph Thomas of NSW and James Thomas of Aberdeen.  A fourth son, William, died two years ago.  During his life he twice revisited Cornwall.
