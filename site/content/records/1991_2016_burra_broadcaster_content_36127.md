Princess Royal Feedlot

A feedlot for 1,500 head was given provisional development consent by Goyder Council’s Development Assessment Panel last week.  It would enable Simon Rowe’s Princess royal property to finish up 1,000 lambs and 1,350 cattle at any one time.  The plan is for eight cattle pens and two dual purpose pens covering a 6.43 ha area.  It includes a manure storage area 115 x 50 m, a sedimentation pond of 1.3 mega litres, a storage lagoon of 10.5 mega litres and a feed mill.  The plan is a for a controlled drainage area able to handle two one in a hundred year floods within the controlled area.  The site is four km south of Burra.  Representations concerning environmental issues were made by Roger Cross, Jenny Carter, Burra Creek Land Care Group, Yorke Mid North Consultative Committee, Lindner’s Wonga Pastoral Co. and Graham Whetstone.  They were concerned about possible impacts on the quality and quantity of water in the Burra Creek and on ground water supplies and quality.  The Environmental Protection Authority has deemed the proposal ‘represents an acceptably low risk of environmental harm, provided it is designed, constructed and operated in accordance with the guidelines for the establishment and operation of feedlots in SA.
