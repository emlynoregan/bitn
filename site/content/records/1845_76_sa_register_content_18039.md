‘Bushman Now’ writes on 28 November

[He writes to explain some of the costs of the squatter in the north.]

Huts are for the most part pine with a thatched roof and cost perhaps £10.  A brush yards may be erected for £3 to £5 or even more cheaply.

Sheep are generally run in flocks of 2,000 and weaners often of 3,000.  If the shepherd is a married man he gets £40 p.a. and double rations, which are ½ lb tea, 4 lb sugar, 20 lb flour and a sheep a week – or in many places two in three weeks.  Costs?  Tea of the cheapest sort say 1/- for half a pound.  Sugar of the blackest and cheapest, say 4 lb for 1/4.  Good quality flour say 4/6 for 20 lb.  The sheep are invariably aged ewes past bearing lambs – no one thinks of chewing it – merely softening it a little and then bolting it.

Thus the pay for a married couple is 15/4 plus rations worth 6/10 or say £1-2-0 a week, plus the sheep in question.  The squatters argue this is too much.  They thus have cheaper labour than the struggling cockatoo and feed their servants worse.  Wearing apparel costs 60 to 80% more than in Adelaide.  Their children get no education and the family forgoes membership of any religious body and also health, for they are deprived of vegetables.  The only group who may accumulate money are men with three or four lads from 8 to 18 who may have an extra flock or two to herd.  Where better have been made such as a stone building, they are on purchased land with surface water included and located strategically to discourage anyone else from later bidding for the run.
