Adelaide Chemical Company has expansion plans for 1992.

The largest expansion for 20 years is underway.  More than $3 million will be spent in 1992 as a part of an $8 million expansion over the next three years.  This will expand the range of products and the range of possible raw materials as raw feed.  Burra is the largest cupric oxide plant in the world.  It supplies more than 25% of the world’s needs for use as an ingredient in timber preservation, as a catalyst for some chemical manufacture, ferrites in the electronics industry, in tyres and in ceramics.

Over 90% of the production is exported and it brings over $20 million into Australia as export revenue annually.  To remain competitive and expand AdChem needed to treat alternative feed materials.  The retrofit of the multiple hearth roaster was chosen as the best way to do this.  It was originally built in 1972 to roast ore dry from the Burra Mine.  It converted malachite and azurite into impure copper metal.  This then became the feed material for the cupric oxide process still used today.  When the Burra ore was exhausted the roaster stopped in 1982.  AdChem then converted to treating copper cement and scrap.

It was known that there was a great opportunity to treat copper sulphide concentrates.  Adelaide and Wallaroo Fertilisers tested the process in the mid 1980s, but diverted their attention elsewhere before it was successful.  In 1990 CSIRO performed an extensive test program and a short full-scale trial followed on the Burra roaster in September 1990.  Results were encouraging and there were further tests at a pilot plant in Belgium.  These results were used to design the roaster retrofit.

The multiple hearth roaster at ACC is among the largest in the Southern Hemisphere.  It stands 26.3 m high and is 7.8 m in diameter.  Feed material enters at the top and slowly works its way through 12 hearths to leave at the bottom.  Air and natural gas go the other way.

The copper sulphide concentrate is heated to over 800°C and mixed with air.  The minerals roast to form sulphur dioxide gas and low grade copper oxide.  The sulphur dioxide is scrubbed and the solids are temporarily stored.  They are later given a second pass through the furnace.  The copper oxide reacts with natural gas to form Carbon dioxide and impure copper metal.  This product is similar to that produced from Burra ore in the 1970s.  It is leached in ammonium carbonate solution in the same way to produce cupric oxide.

ACC works closely with the SA Department of Environment and Planning and the scrubber system to remove sulphur dioxide is designed to be four times better than specified levels.  Well over $1 million has been spent on this piece of equipment.  It converts the sulphur dioxide to sodium sulphite.  Construction will begin next month on a plant to crystallise sodium sulphite for sale to paper manufacturers.

In mid-March ACC began trials using copper sulphite concentrate from a mine at Moonta.  After three short runs the plant ran for six continuous days in mid-April.  This confirmed that the plant could produce a good product and that the sulphur dioxide scrubbing was very effective.

The roaster will be shut down till the end of June while the filter is being built.  ACC will then have an exceptionally clean roaster by world standards.

The new work has increased traffic and noise and ACC will construct a road from Copperhouse Street directly into the plant so that heavy vehicles do not have to enter the town.  Other noise reduction work is underway.  Employees are being given more chance for personal development than ever before.

[A personal development program is then outlined.]

Eight new people joined ACC in the past six months and eight more permanent positions will be created in the next six months.  More than 55 people will then work at the Burra Plant.
