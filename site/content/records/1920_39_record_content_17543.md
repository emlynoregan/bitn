St Brendan’s Church Mt Bryan

Dr Killian, Catholic Bishop of Pt Augusta, blessed and opened the new Catholic Church at Mt Bryan on 25 October at 10.30 a.m. in the presence of a large crowd.  Mass was then celebrated.  The contractor had been Mr W. Brady.  A collection reduced the church debt by c. £200.  The present debt is something over £400.  Lunch was taken in the Soldiers’ Memorial Hall.

Evening Devotions followed at 3 p.m.  St Joseph’s Choir from Burra attended for the day.  The altar was designed by W. Brady and made by Pengelley & Co. of Adelaide.  It is erected in memory of Rev. James Patrick Redden who was in charge of this parish 1900-1906 and who died at Pekina on 1 June 1910 aged 40.  It had been intended to place a memorial to him in St Joseph’s soon after his death and £16 was raised, but as that church is well furnished they couldn’t decide on the form of the memorial and by now the sum with interest was £22.  The total cost of the altar was £40.  The cost of the building and furnishing was £1,393-4-1 and the cash in hand was £757-1-2.
