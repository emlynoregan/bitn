Kooringa News, 12 September

On Saturday after the arrival of the mail, Mr N. Dawson, on behalf of the inhabitants, presented the mailman, Fred Gurney, with a purse of 10 guineas and an address bearing testimony to the regularity with which he has, on his days of driving, delivered the mails from Adelaide during the past winter.

Great preparations are in hand for the holding of a bazaar in the Institute in aid of funds for the erection of a Church of England at Redruth.  The foundation stone will be laid by the Lord Bishop assisted by the Dean and Archdeacon Woodcock.

Weather.  Showers on Sunday settled the dust and it is hoped that they extended further north where they are much wanted.
