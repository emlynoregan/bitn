Obituary.  Mrs Frank Fillmore died 25 April 1957 at Burra Hospital.  She was born at Bunbury WA and came to this district at an early age, spending most of her life here.  After the death of her first husband, Mr A. Brandt, she trained at the Queen’s Home and in 1931 gained her certificate with the Australian Nursing Federation as an obstetrics nurse.  She did much nursing in the Burra District.  In 1938 she married Mr Frank Fillmore at St Mary’s Church, Burra.  Her three sons, one by her first marriage, all live in Burra and her two daughters live in Adelaide and Mt Gambier.  Mrs A.J. Voumard of Hanson is a sister.
