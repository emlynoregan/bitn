Kooringa News, 14 January

A few bushfires have broken out to the north, principally on the Mt Bryan run.

The smelting works have stopped here for a time.  Seven smelters have moved to Adelaide.  On Tuesday last the refining furnace burst with about 9 tons of molten copper and nearly set fire to the whole building, but through great effort no damage was sustained.

Obituary.  The wife of our esteemed Clerk of the Court Mr A.H. Forder has died and the funeral was very largely attended, with nineteen carriages of all description.  All the principal people of the town attended.

[Born Asenath Jayne Mayne 1836, Cambourne, Cornwall: died 11 January 1865, Redruth, SA.]
