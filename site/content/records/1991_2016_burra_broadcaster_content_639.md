Editorial

In the face of some criticism recently I wish to make my position clear.  The Burra Broadcaster provides a free and public forum for all opinions.  I am not prepared to judge or ridicule the opinions and beliefs of others.  Within the bounds of common sense and decency we publish the views that people send in.  If you wish to put your view to the public we welcome your input.
