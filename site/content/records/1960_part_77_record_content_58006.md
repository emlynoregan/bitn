St Mary’s Church.  Service of Dedication

The dedication of the bookshelves and aumbry [see last issue pages 6 & 7 for further details] was done by the Bishop of Willochra Rt Rev. S.B. Rosier who then celebrated Holy Communion with the assistance of the Rector Fr John Stephenson, the visiting Rector of Christ Church Mt Gambier and the Arch-Deacon of The Murray the Ven. L.R. Lenthall.  Fr Lenthall gave the address outlining the service to the church and community of Mr & Mrs Dollman and the career of Bishop Redding.  All members of the Dollman family were able to be present: Frances Mrs breeze of Adelaide, Helen Mrs Clark of Adelaide, June Mrs Burdon of Burnie Tasmania, Peg Mrs Stephenson of Redcliffe Brisbane and Guy of Burra.

Clem Davey played a brilliant fanfare and sympathetic accompaniment.

The bookshelves were made by Mr Dudley Jacka, but unfortunately a family bereavement prevented him from attending.

The aumbry was designed by N. Rohrlach of Whyalla who attended with his wife and the steelwork of the aumbry safe was fabricated by Mr R.L. Thamm.  Beaten brasswork overlays the safe and this was the work of Adelaide silversmith John Hale.  The late delivery of the safe prevented its being lined with silk, but this will be done as soon as possible.  The front panel depicts the Lamb of God and on this occasion it is portrayed as a stud Merino ram.  The luncheon at the RSL Hall was attended by more than half the congregation.  The Bishop and family stayed overnight and intended to have a barbecue at he World’s End Gorge the next day, but rain prevented this.
