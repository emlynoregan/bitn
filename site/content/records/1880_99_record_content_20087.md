Ratepayers’ Meeting at the Institute on Thursday with Cr Ridgway in the chair. The Mayor delivered his report.

At the start of the year the debt was £440-11-11 and a coupon for £25 falling on 1 February brought this to £465-11-11.  And a bond and coupon for £132-10-0 were due on 1 April.

To pay all this without virtually stopping all work was the puzzle.  Much of the debt was due to the Recreational Ground from which no real return could be expected in the short term.  A scheme had to be devised whereby this piece of property could repay its debt to the general fund and in the longer term gradually extinguish its debt.

It was pointed out that a Parkland rate could be struck and if the council were to borrow £500 then a Parkland rate at 2d in the £ would pay it off in a few years.

The Town Clerk could show that though the whole debt to the Recreation Ground on 1 April 1885 was £781, the rate could redeem it by 1 April 1893 and it was also thought that with strict economy the Health Rate could be reduced from 3d in the £ to 2d in the £ making the overall increase in rates only 1d in the £.  The ratepayers duly approved the £500 loan.

£384 of the loan went to the general account and the rest was absorbed by the debt due by the Recreation Ground to the Bank.

Strict economy was then practised.  There were suggestions to amalgamate jobs, but it was decided it was impractical to combine the Town Clerk’s job and the Inspector’s jobs.  Nevertheless duties and salaries were arranged so that nearly all the rates could be spent on Public Works.
