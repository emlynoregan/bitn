Burra Common Effluent Scheme (STEDS)

Extension to the scheme will cover forty blocks. (25 houses and 15 vacant allotments.)  The extension has been undertaken to solve the problems of effluent disposal experienced by some houses and also because allotments within 50 m of the creek could not be sold for housing development without sewerage provisions.  The work is progressing smoothly and should come in under budget.
