Goyder Council

The first meeting of Council since the recent elections.

Council proposed to the Geographical Names Advisory Committee that the area northwest of Hallett be named McVitties Flat after William McVittie, who arrived on the Baboo in 1840.  The name has been used locally for years.

Council resolved to prepare a brief for a consultant to undertake a feasibility study into the development of the Farrell Flat Airstrip along with a costing study.

Council will ask Transport SA to declare the length of Commercial Street from the end of the 80 km/hr sign to the Council Office in Market Square and Market Square/Market Street to St Joseph’s Lane a 50 km/hr zone.  [Along with various other listed changes in the Council area.]

[Issue 604, 4 June 2003, page 1 corrected this to the effect that Council ratified a TSA decision to declare the 50 km/hr zones as listed in the paper.]

Burra Show Society will receive a donation equal to 50% of its rates.

Rate relief for Barkers of Baldina Cottage Homes in Burra was refused.
