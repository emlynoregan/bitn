Centenary Funds

A public meeting was held in April 1945 and a committee elected to organise the town’s centenary celebrations.  At this meeting a motion was passed that all profits from the centenary were to be used to build a swimming pool in Burra.  A public meeting was recently held to consider a motion to rescind that resolution.  There was a fair attendance and Mr F.T. Marston, as Secretary, read the notice calling the meeting and reported on the interview with the District Engineer concerning the damming of the creek.

Dr Steele said the notice was out of order because people had contributed to the funds on the understanding that profits were to go towards the swimming pool and he considered the funds were trust monies and the consent of both State and Federal Treasuries would be needed to direct them to another use.  People would feel diffident about contributing to causes if the funds could be diverted after being collected.

Mr Coverdale said the first public meeting had no right to decide on the purpose the profits could be used for because at that time there were no funds on hand.

R.C. Lott said if the creek were dammed a swimming pool would be formed.

Dr Steele wanted a ruling on whether the notice of motion could be accepted.  The chair then decided it was necessary to get legal advice.

Mr Jennison as mover of the original motion felt the people then were well aware of what they were about and if the motion were rescinded he for one would feel he had been working under false pretences.  He said it was all ‘hooey’ to say the cost of a pool would be £3,000 to £4,000.  Nuriootpa had a pool whose estimated cost of £2,000 had been reduced by a third by the use of voluntary labour.

The Chairman said the plans mentioned by Mr Jennison were for a pool that would have cost over £2,000 before the war and in any case it would not be possible to get materials at present.

Mr Bevan was asked to withdraw the motion to rescind, but he refused.

The meeting was adjourned for a legal opinion.
