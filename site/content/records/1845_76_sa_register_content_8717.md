SA Mining Association.  [Editorial]

The SA Mining Association has released its Ninth Annual Report.

The capital stock as originally subscribed was £12,320 and this has been augmented by the sum of £123,200, which has been derived entirely from clear and available profits after the distribution of 21 dividends.  A sum of £12,614-12-3 is available for a dividend of 100% and will become payable on 3 June next.  Mineral or metallic products available for further realisation will give immediate assurance of future dividends.

The prospective advantages are cheering not only for shareholders, but for all colonists, as all have benefited from the prosperity of the Burra.  All may hope for a return of previous prosperity, inasmuch as new discoveries are accompanied by the likelihood of the return of labour from the goldfields.  Captain Roach has expressed his hope that the great engine will be at work and the water pumped from the Mine before his next report.  This would enable him to report on splendid lodes in the deeper levels as well as recent red oxide deposits recently discovered at the depth of a few fathoms.  The election of Directors for the ensuing year produced Messrs William Allen, Thomas Waterhouse, Nicholas Peter LeBair, George Strickland Kingston, George Hall, William Peacock, William Paxton and Frederick John Beck.  Auditor George Tinline has left SA and his place has been taken by John Brown.

Including officers there are 191 persons employed; a force so inadequate that the Directors have declared that the want of labour is most acutely felt.
