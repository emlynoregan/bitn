The Tiver Reunion

A reunion of descendants of James Tiver, who was born 11 June 1929, will be held at Burra 12 October.

James was the son of a baker, Hugh Tiver and his wife Rebecca of Bristol, England.  Hugh died young and James received little education, going to work aged 8 as an apprentice mason.  He married Elizabeth South of Newport and with a young son, James Hugh (then under 2) sailed from Plymouth in the David Malcolm.  A daughter, Margaret Malcolm Tiver, was born on the voyage.  They arrived at Port Adelaide in April 1855 and were met by an uncle, James Rosser.  They came to Burra by bullock dray and James erected a wattle and daub hut near the ford1 where Mr & Mrs Roy Jeffery now live.  Elizabeth died in 1856 and in 1858 James married Emma Price, who had come to SA in 1856 in the Alloquis.  From this marriage there were ten children.  James did contracting work and also did carting to and from Port Adelaide.  He built the middle house in Tiver’s Row in Redruth and it was there that most of the children were born.  Later with Emma’s help he added the houses either side to create Tiver’s Row.  In 1870 he built the house and store at Aberdeen2 and the family then lived there.  Emma and step-son James Hugh Tiver kept the store and James continued with contract work, employing as many as 100 men.  He participated in the construction of the Wallaroo Smelting Works.  James said it was cheaper to cart beer from Port Adelaide than water for the men at Wallaroo.  With Mr Thomas Burgoyne MP and Mr Aaron Cole he built the first macadamised roads in the district, the Aberdeen Ford, the Redruth Bridge3, the original Burra Institute, Burra Railway Station and Yards, the Stationmaster’s residences, from Tarlee to Farrell Flat and many private homes.  When the railway was extended to Hallett in 1876 he opened a branch store there and James Hugh then ran the Hallett Store and became a Councillor and Chairman of the Hallett DC at various times.  James Hugh Tiver died aged 434.

Later James had a large plant at Terowie for building the new railway yard there for the line to continue to Petersburg.  James also bought land; first Mt Cone at Mt Bryan for £1 per acre.  He sold this and bought country at McVitties Flat near Hallett, which he later sold and bought Harry’s, Opie’s and Gare’s farms at ‘Banbury’ Hallett.

In 1888 and later James and his sons purchased and were allotted pastoral leases when the Government cut up the old Paratoo Run and so they founded ‘Pats Well’, later to become ‘Tiverton’.  James was a member of the Kooringa5 Corporation, a Superintendent of the Sunday School and office bearer in the Methodist Church for many years.  He was also a JP and member of both the Masonic and Oddfellows Lodges for many years.  Despite a long hard struggle against drought, James eventually became a prosperous pastoralist.  He died 12 March 1909.  Emma lived until 1926 and died aged almost 90.  She was always a very active support for James and once when he urgently needed supplies at Wallaroo, she packed quickly and made the journey there in a bullock dray with some of the young family.  With no accommodation on arrival they erected an ‘instant cottage’ in one day.  The children of Emma and James were:

Mary Ann (Mrs [Edward Francis] Opie)	Albert Joseph (who died as a child) [aged 3]

Charles Godwin	George Samuel

Emma Price [Mrs John Sara]	Charlotte Dunn [Mrs Arthur Stock]

Edgar	Henry (Harry)

Emily Price6 [Mrs Arthur Sara]	Harold Walter

[Notes:

1In Young Street.

2Tiver’s Railway Store, later known as Sara’s Store on the corner of Young and Morehead Streets.

3This was the 1861 timber bridge.  Tiver & Cole contracted for the masonry abutments.  By 1878 the timbers had rotted and it was replaced by a steel bridge in 1879.  It is possible that the original abutments were retained, but further research would be needed to verify that.

4James Hugh Tiver 3 June 1853-10 April 1896; making him 42 at death.

5This was actually the Burra Corporation or Town Council of Burra.  James Tiver was the Councillor for North Ward December 1883 to November 1887.

6The ‘Price’ is probably an error; it is not added in any of the birth, marriage or death registrations.]
