Dr Miller reports on the premises occupied by Mrs Thomas and suggests a letter be sent to the trustees regarding the sanitary condition of the house.

Re Mr Luke Day’s house – a box gutter is in need of repair and the back yard is littered and though not in an unsanitary condition, it could be a fire hazard.  The pit type toilet needs resiting.

Resolved that letters be sent:

To Mrs Thomas re the condition of her place.

To the landlord to attend to the matter within 28 days.

To Mr L. Day to renew the pit lavatory and repair the box gutter.
