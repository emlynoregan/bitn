The Public Works Committee allow the Town Clerk to define and set out a road towards Baldina from the Smelting Works Stables.

Cr Ridgway withdrew his resignation at the request of Crs Tiver, West & Coglin.

Cr Ridgway gave notice of a motion: -

‘That the road on the western side of the railway be made from the gate to the boundary.’

Resolved that the Council will not in future pay for repairs to the pump in Market Square, but they will be divided between East and West Wards equally.
