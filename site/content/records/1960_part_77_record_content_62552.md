Note by Ian Auhl:

It has been stated that the population of Burra in 1850 was 20,000.  This is incorrect.  The combined population of Redruth, Aberdeen and Kooringa was a little over 4,500 and 1003 men and boys were employed at the Burra Mine.  By 1861 the population of the three towns was 4,347.  The SA Mining Association then employed 1,208 men and the population of the County of Burra was 5,483 with 15,856 acres under cultivation.  By 1871 the population of the three towns had fallen to 3,401 and the cultivated area had increased to 65, 215 acres.
