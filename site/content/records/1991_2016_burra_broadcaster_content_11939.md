Clare and Burra Hospitals continued to work together in areas of administration, payroll and trade accounts and in February Burra Hospital agreed in principle to form a joint board with Clare.  Further negotiations include Burra, Clare and Snowtown Hospitals having one board of directors and one CEO.  Buildings, plant and capital funds are to remain the property of each local community.  Burra Director of Nursing, Lesley Phillips transferred to Clare in July and Noreen Hallion took over in Burra.  The last AGM of the Burra Hospital reflected sadness at the end of 119 years of independent operation and excitement at the projected amalgamation.
