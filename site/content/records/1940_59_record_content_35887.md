Burra Show Society held its AGM at the Eastern Telephone Building last Tuesday.  The meeting was poorly attended and barely reached the number of 15 required for a quorum.

Retiring President A.B. Riggs reported on the previous year’s activities.

Early in the year K.R. Crewes resigned as Secretary and was replaced by H.M. Scott.  Extensive repairs done in 1946 meant that there was little to do in that way for 1947.

The sale of a portion of the iron fencing realised £104.

Subscriptions were unfortunately down on 1946.

Show day was pleasant and drew a good attendance, resulting in a profit of £158, exactly the same as the figure for 1946.

In the past year a sub-committee appointed to look into the possibility of transferring the show to the Burra Sports Syndicate’s grounds met with representatives of the Royal Agricultural Society and the SAJC.

Despite the profit on show day of £158, allowance of £619 for depreciation has resulted in an annual deficiency of £461.

Elected: Patron, A.G. Owen-Smyth; Vice-Presidents, F.H. Reed and one to be elected.  No nominations were received for the other positions and the matter will be addressed at the meeting of 9 April.
