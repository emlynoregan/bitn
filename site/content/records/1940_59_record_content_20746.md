The Local Board of Health has received a letter from Dr Steele complaining about the state of the Bacon Factory, located next door to his residence.  He complains that sheep carcases have been left in the yard, of smoke coming through the doctorâ€™s waiting room windows, and of the general untidiness of the yard.  He holds that the factory needs to be removed away from the centre of town and that it has reduced the value of his residence by 25%.  The Board felt it was too late to act now because the factory had been issued with instructions and the owner had gone to considerable expense to comply with those instructions.
