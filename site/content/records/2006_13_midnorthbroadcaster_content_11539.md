Burra Skate Park plans received a boost with a $15,000 Community Benefits SA grant to the Youth Advisory Council.   This will go along with another $20,000 marked for the project which aims to construct a concrete structure similar to that at Clare.  The site at the present half pipe location has been chosen and the soil tested.  The project will need about $150,000 including landscaping.
