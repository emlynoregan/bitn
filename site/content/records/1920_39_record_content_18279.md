Burra Town Council, 4 January

D. Jones was granted permission to erect a hoarding on the road near the Mine Bridge at an annual rental of £1.

The Mayor wanted the guns in Market Square moved, as they spoiled the appearance of the monument.

The Town Clerk said the Council could put them where it chose.

Cr Harris wanted them removed to the reserve opposite the Institute.

Cr Allen favoured their removal.

Cr Riggs did not.  If they were to be put out of sight they might as well be scrapped.

Cr Kellock would leave them where they were, remembering the good deal of feeling shown at the time they were got.  He had heard no complaints.

Cr Harris moved their removal to opposite the Institute.  Carried with Riggs and Kellock against.

‘Cr Wollacott [sic] moved that a drain be made at the bottom of “Cowdung Hill” in Mivigizzie [sic: for Mevagessey) Street to turn the water.  Seconded by Cr Riggs and carried.’
