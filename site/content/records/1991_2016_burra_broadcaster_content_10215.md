Burra Mine

On Saturday two eleven-year-olds, a girl and a boy, entered the mine site through a hole in the fence.  They slid down a loose slope and came to rest on a ledge near the waterâ€™s edge.  A third child with them ran for help.  Police, parents and the local SES were alerted.  After a rescue by abseiling down the open cut wall was deemed too hazardous due to falling rocks, the pair were retrieved by boat.
