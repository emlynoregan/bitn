Mr W. Anderson whose letter appears on page 1 left Burra many years ago.  He kept a bootmaker’s shop on the property now occupied by Mr A. Lomman and the family home, now demolished, was where Mr L.M. Gordon’s home now stands.  The old Records prior to the present owner were either burnt or lost and we thank Mr Anderson for information we have previously tried to obtain without success.
