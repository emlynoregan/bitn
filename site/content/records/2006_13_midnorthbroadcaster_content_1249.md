Local Airport.  After five years of lobbying, Goyder and Clare & Gilbert Valley Councils have agreed to back a local airport.  Bob Bradley, owner of the present airstrip at Farrell Flat, has been concerned about public liability, but says if a suitable arrangement for a lease could be made, he would support the airstripâ€™s use.  The Councils would look at the possibility of filling in a creek, which stops the extension of the 750 m airstrip.  The present site is ideally situated.  [Support from a series of other interested parties is listed.]
