Burra Town Council.

A petition called for work to be done on High St & Wellington Road, Hampton, both of which were in a deplorable state.

Cr Sampson said as far as he understood it the gutters needed to be cleaned out.

The Town Clerk reported that construction of a town pound would cost over Â£100 as a separate set of yards would be needed for diseased cattle.  Matter to be left in abeyance.
