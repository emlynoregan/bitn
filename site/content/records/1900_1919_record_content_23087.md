Redruth Court, Monday.

There is further on the rabbit cases together with that of Annie Ford, who seems not to have made much effort to kill rabbits and who failed to appear.  She was fined £5 reduced to £2 + £3 costs.

Comments from the bench seem to bear out the impression that they thought the law was unjust.
