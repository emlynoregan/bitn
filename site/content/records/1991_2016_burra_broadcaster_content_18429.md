The Jailhouse Rock Festival was held over the weekend.  About 300 went to the Redruth Gaol for a night of rock ʼn’ roll.  Paul O’Bryan’s Band supplied the music for a rock ʼn’ roll demonstration in Market Square on Saturday morning [Photo] and the weekend ended with a morning brunch on the banks of the Burra Creek on Sunday.  There was music by Rockin’ the Jukebox and Adelaide Bands at both the Bon Accord and the Royal Exchange Hotels.
