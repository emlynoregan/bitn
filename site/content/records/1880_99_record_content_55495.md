Editorial on Town Council Matters.

At the last meeting all offices were declared vacant and subsequently all but the Town Clerk’s filled.  This was inadvertently overlooked, so at present there is no Town Clerk.  As a reward for faithful service Mr J.R. Gray has been sent about his business and Joseph Snell appointed Inspector.  While there is nothing to be said against Mr Snell, he does not have the qualifications Mr Gray holds – the diseased meat question for instance.  We must have an inspector who can deal with that.  We have no public health officer.  We are not surprised at the dismissal of the Engineer of the Waterworks.

The editor calls for a public meeting to instruct the Councillors what to do.

[The oversight with respect to the Town Clerk’s position was actually corrected before the editorial went to press.]
