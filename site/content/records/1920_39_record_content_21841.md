Burra Hospital

The usual Christmas treat took place on 23 December.  There was a tinge of sadness due to the recent death of Miss Kathleen Sandland who had been an organiser for many years.  The principal organiser for this year was Mrs Maurice Collins assisted by her two daughters, Pat and Jean, with Mrs George Hann, Mrs W.J.C. Ewins and the Misses J. Craig and S. & G. Lawrence.  There was a musical program followed by speeches, a distribution of gifts and then supper.

The Chairman, W.G. Hawkes said the treat had originated with the late Mrs E.C. Lockyer and was continued by Miss Edith Cave and Miss Sandland.  This year was the jubilee of the hospital.  In 1870 [sic: error for 1876] a number of public spirited men had bought the Burra Hotel and it had been turned into a hospital.  The Maternity Wing was coming into its own and within a year they expected to have a new Isolation Ward.  The present Matron was Sister G. Siegele.  It was the 5th oldest hospital in SA.  He paid tribute to Miss Sandland and the Mayor added his tribute as well.

D. Jones won the tender for painting the hospital exterior.

Burra Red Cross sent £25 for sick soldiers to use as the Adelaide Branch saw fit.  This, with other donations allowed a gift of £2 to each consumptive soldier at the North Terrace home – they decided to give cash as these men did not get a pension.

Burra Seaside Trip.  A meeting at the Institute on 21 December chose Semaphore for the trip on 5 February 1927.
