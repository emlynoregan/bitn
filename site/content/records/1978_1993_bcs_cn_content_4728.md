Muriel Elizabeth Mary Bence

Born in London ‘in the olden days’.  Educated at St Jude’s Church of England Southwark and West Square Secondary.  In 1939 was evacuated to the country, but returned in time for the first air raid.  Lived and worked in London through WWII at Oldham’s Press Woman Magazine, then as Post Office counter clerk at Lambeth Walk PO, Balham Hill PO and Streatham PO.  Later in the office of two Government Departments and that of the South African High Commissioner.  In January 1945 met FO Leonard Bence at a reception at South Africa House and married him at St Margaret’s the Queen in June 1945.  Arrived in SA in March 1946 and came to Burra in August 1947 with a 10-day-old son.  Two other sons were born in Burra (one deceased).

Instigator and Secretary of the Burra Branch of the Arts Council of SA.

Inaugural member and President of M & BHA.

Inaugural member of Burra Meals on Wheels.

Inaugural member of Burra Committee of the Adelaide Children’s Hospital.

Inaugural member Group 23 Burra branch of the Penguin Club of Australia – President, Secretary and Convention Speaker.

Member of Burra Red Cross with 25 year service medal.

Member Burra Cup Committee – Past president and Secretary.

Member Burra Hospital Auxiliary.

Member Burra & District Advisory Committee.

In favour of progress, but not just for the sake of change and not if it interferes with the interests and quality of life of the Burra people.

Having travelled widely I consider SA and Burra specifically a highly desirable place to live.

Fully prepared to devote time and energy to the Council to maintain Burra as that desirable place.
