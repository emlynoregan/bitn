Smelts Chimney to be Blown Down

For years the chimney has been the roost for thousands of pigeons.  Occasionally for celebrations someone burnt tyres in it and it came briefly to life.  Various Councils have suggested demolition because of the dangers to children playing around its base.  This time it is to go for keeps.  Albert Morrison has the job of dynamiting the chimney and has been preparing it for some time.  In the process over 200 bags of pigeon manure have been removed.  The base walls are 3 ft 6 inches thick and the foundations are about 10 ft deep.  The bricks at the base are a special fire resistant type of whitish kaolin, while further up they are a mixture of red clay and kaolin.  All are particularly hard.  Mr Morrison has brought into the office a brick branded 1846.  The kaolin is said to have come from a deposit about 18 miles east at Motherall’s.  The red clay came from an old kiln area near the cemetery.  The supply at Motherall’s is still plentiful and it is a pity it is not being used.  The chimney is being demolished to obtain the bricks, and to avoid too many being broken, demolition is being held off until rain has softened the ground and given the bricks some moisture content.  Originally the Smelts Chimney was low, with a short draft, but an engineer from Germany advised building it higher and feeding it with a draft of about 100 yards.
