News from Melbourne by overland mail is conflicting.  Numerous adventurers have evidently accumulated 1,999 ounces of gold, which has been received in Melbourne.  One lump has been found weighing 7 lb 3 oz and the finder was asking Â£350 for this.

The Melbourne Daily News has always shown the discoveries in the best light, but now pours scorn on  the folly of those parties, who unaccustomed to manual labour, have indulged in vain hopes of a golden harvest, without being prepared to face severe toil and disappointment.

Many unsuccessful persons have returned to Melbourne, but many others who had found the Ballarat diggings preoccupied or unremunerative had moved on to Mount Alexander, but of the prospects there we are not informed.

In contrast to this a letter to Messrs Cleve of Adelaide from correspondents in Melbourne dated 17 October says that the excitement continues to increase.  All able-bodied men had gone to the diggings and many are doing well.  Others are merely earning wages and some are doing no good at all.  The whole appears a lottery.

Another account dated 15 October:

It cannot be denied that the diggings are very rich, but the gold is found only in one vein and that vein is rich only now and then.  The gold fever is terrible.  Melbourne is quite a deserted place with no drays or carts seen in the streets.  The fever has come to the point and has begun to abate. The population is now returning as rapidly as it went.  There are some extraordinary stories of gold finding, but only by parties who came at the beginning and took possession of the principal place.  Of 15,000 men at the diggings last week, I am sure not 2,000 will get anything near their expectations.  According to all appearances we will get here some new and perhaps richer mines than at Sydney, but until such new discoveries are made I would advise no one who is getting a respectable living to come here.  Sometimes it is 20 to 25 ft, even through rock to get to the gold, and then it is likely nothing will be found except in the best spots.

The newspaper continues:

It is clear that the atmosphere in Melbourne is clearing and business returning more to normal.  The Ballarat Diggings, if not exhausted are at least abundantly preoccupied and either the mass of men now converging on Melbourne must find new fields or occupy themselves with ordinary industrial pursuits.  In that case Melbourne will soon be as oversupplied with labour as Sydney is now.
