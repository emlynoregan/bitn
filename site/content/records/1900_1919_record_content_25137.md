[The following strange notice appears without other explanation and needs further research.]

Notice.

‘Dear Englishmen –

I will address you at Bentley’s Corner on Tuesday Nov. 2, at 7 p.m., if fine weather, if inclement weather then the following Tuesday (Nov. 9) England is in danger – but be not afraid separate yourselves.  Hurrah for God and England; Hurrah for Wirrabara!  Hurrah for Waterford!

MRS ADELAIDE WILMSHURST’
