G for ‘George’, the famous Lancashire Bomber, now in Australia, will fly over Burra on Thursday between 11 and 11.30 a.m.  It will circle the town three times and we understand will be accompanied by a famous Beaufighter.  The trip around Australia is part of the promotion of the Third Victory Loan.  Shops in Burra will close for about 30 minutes and His Worship the Mayor will possibly make a special appeal for the Loan.  The aircraft will be piloted by Flt-Lt Hudson and Flt-Sgt Tickle of Unley, SA, will be a member of the nine man crew.  Accompanying the crew on the tour will be Mrs Richard Gething, who is a distinguished Ferry Pilot herself and will act as publicity Officer for the tour.  [This plane was installed in the Australian National War Memorial after the War.]
