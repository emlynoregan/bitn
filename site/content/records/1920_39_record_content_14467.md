Mayor’s Report 1924 shows the year started with a credit balance of £257-19-10 and ended with about £141.  The report shows little of much interest other than what has already been noted re the need for an ambulance and the reduction in the Fire Brigade debt.  The lighting account obviously reflects the arrival on the scene of the Burra Electric Supply Co.  This year the cost of carbide was £6-8-0, of lamp lighting was £20-6-6 and for electric lighting was £169-11-8.
