Ethel May Bruse, born 4 October 1877, daughter of H.M. Bruce, carpenter, has been praised in Adelaide for her singing at a concert there: ‘a thoroughly rich, pure contralto, with ample range, splendid quality, and it was utilized with artistic taste hardly to be expected from one so inexperienced.’ (Register)
