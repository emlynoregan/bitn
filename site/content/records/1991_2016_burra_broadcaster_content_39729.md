Burra Uniting Church had a good congregation of more than 100 to celebrate the centenary of the church building on Sunday 21 September.  Chairman of the Congregation, John Arthur welcomed everyone.  Hymns ranged from traditional to modern.  Don Lloyd presented the historical story of the church building to current times.  Current Minister Darren Lovell preached from the high pulpit on the text used at the opening of the building.  A sit down lunch was provided in the hall.  Mrs Olive Oates, who was organist and choir leader at the church for many years, cut a special anniversary cake.  [3 photos.]
