Bible Christian Centenary by the Rev. W.F. James.

The denomination began in a farmhouse in North Devon in October 1815 and circuits, districts and conferences were organised as it spread.  It started in Canada in 1831.  In SA James Blatchford took five days to come to Burra from Adelaide by bullock dray.  He began services at Burra as a local preacher with John Pellew and James Halse.  A church to seat 200 was built and there were soon 40 members attending and a Sunday school.  In 1850 James Way arrived from England with James Rowe.  Way settled in Adelaide and James Rowe came to Burra.  He lived in the creek till a house was built.  The church was doubled in size.  Later in James Way’s pastorate there were 320 converts and a church to seat 600 was built.  During my first term in Burra a new manse was built and over £500 raised towards it.  Centenary celebrations will be held throughout Adelaide on 9 & 11 October.
