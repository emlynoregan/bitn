Mongolata Goldfield

Byles’ Mongolata GM to 29 June.

At 200ft level.  The winze advanced to 147ft and timbered on 6ft lode showing traces of gold.

At 92ft level.  South drive advanced to 250ft on a 3ft wide lode of low grade.

At 52ft level.  No. 1 stope north is on 18” lode averaging 5dwt per ton by pan test.

160 tons ready to crush.

Golden Harp.  No. 1 winze Baker’s Tunnel advanced to 104ft on 3ft lode of low grade.

No. 1 shaft winze to connect with bottom level broke through.  Will continue to stope again on 2ft lode averaging 1oz per ton.

No. 2 shaft on the south end of the lease has advanced to 13’6”, lode 18” wide and averaging 5dwt per ton.  There are 20 tons ready to crush.

Baldina Mongolata GM has just crushed 26 tons averaging 1¾oz per ton.

Baldina Mongolata GM Syndicate to 30 June.

Drove 3ft in the drive in the creek, but no values.

Started on north end of plain and struck a 5” seam east of the seam in the shaft.  We are about 20-30ft south of the shaft and getting ore at 1oz per ton.  Prospecting on the south side of the creek has shown no results.

Two parties of tributers have put through parcels of ore at the battery with satisfactory results.

‘Diamond Drill’ writes on who found the Mongolata Gold.  He takes issue with references to the role of W.J. Richards.  He disputes that he has done more than all the other prospectors, saying the Pexton Bros. have put in splendid work and Curlew and Baldina have also done much and the writer feels sure Mr Richards would blush at the suggestion he has done more – perhaps Mr Morgan meant he had done more than the Government.
