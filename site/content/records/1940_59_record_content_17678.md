Burra Town Council, 15 May.

[Council appears to have previously sent a letter to the Minister of the Army complaining about the use of POWs on farms, probably fearing competition for jobs and the following reply clarified the situation.]

The Minister for the Army replied to Council’s letter stating that the use of POWs was relieving a labour shortage and at the war’s end they would be repatriated and the Government always had the interests of returned soldiers in mind.
