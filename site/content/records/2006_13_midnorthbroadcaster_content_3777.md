Vandals have smashed a window and damaged a donation box at the Redruth Gaol.  Damage is estimated at $500.  Bill Martin said vandalism was an increasing problem in the area.  Not long ago another window was broken at a cost of $100 to repair and the Brewery Cellars gate was pulled off.  Hamptonâ€™s fence has also been damaged and public toilets near the sites have also been damaged.
