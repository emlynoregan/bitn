Characteristics of the 1929 paper.

Page 1.

Normally this has large advertisements for local businesses.  Small amounts of news sometimes found their way here.

Page 2.

This is usually full of a couple of large advertisements from Bence’s and Drew & Crewes’ along with a host of smaller advertisements, Local Government notices and classified advertisements.  News rarely starts on this page, but occasionally a little may be found in column seven.

Page 3.

This is the main location for news of the town and district with a few large advertisements.

Page 4.

This has a fluctuating ratio of news to advertisements.

Supplements

These were included more often than not.  While generally they are the smaller 5-column width format, full sized sheets are not uncommon.

Photographs are fairly common, but very few are local and they normally accompany items of interest from overseas showing things like an airship over Washington DC for instance.

In general the paper carries a lot of local news and is quite a good record of the year’s events in the town.  Editorial comment while not entirely absent, is rather minimal.
