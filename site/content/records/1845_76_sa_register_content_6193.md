Destructive Floods at Burra

Last Monday the tributary to the Burra Creek, which runs through part of Kooringa, became suddenly charged with water to such a degree that many of the inhabitants thought that two waterspouts had burst over the town threatening its total destruction.  Up to the latest reports the mine had received no damage, but storekeepers and other residents, especially those living in the creek, have sustained great losses, running, it is said, into many thousands of pounds.

One report at 11 p.m. said that the flood had collected at the Smelting House Bridge and all in the creek – that is those living in the excavated houses from thence down to Ware’s, have now turned out.  The church schoolroom has been opened to receive them.

Another report said that at about 5 p.m. two waterspouts [i.e. cloudbursts] broke over the township and in less than two minutes the streets were a sheet of water, carrying everything before it – horses, carts, pigs, fences etc.  Now at 7 p.m. the shops are all closed and all is confusion.  Women are running in water up to their knees from the creek, crying for their children.  Water is four feet high in Thompson & Boord’s shop and the same in Benjamin’s.  The street presents the appearance of a rough sea.  We have done all we could to render assistance to those unfortunates in the creek.  It is not known yet if lives have been lost, but the destruction of property will amount to thousands.

Another report:

‘This afternoon I have witnessed such a flood as I little expected to see here.  All the garden fence was washed away, and a heavy dray was not only washed from the garden, but carried down to Boord’s stores.  Several of the stores are full of water.  Mr Boord, I fear, will be a heavy loser.  His cellar was five or six feet deep in water, and some 30 to 40 pigs are gone.  Thomson and Kekwick are also among the unfortunates, and the creek huts are all being driven down the stream.  If it had happened in the night, many lives would have been lost.  Some steps should now be taken to prevent people from living in the creek. We – I mean our own houses – have happily escaped without any serious damage.’

The paper’s own correspondent wrote:

‘Kooringa, Monday Evening, 12th May, 1851.

We are all afloat here, the heavy rains which have fallen the last few days, assisted by the immense drain last night and to-day, hade deluged us; Commercial-street (the principal one in the township) has all the appearance of a huge river running through the township into the Burra creek with the force of Niagara!  Empty casks, large logs of wood, and even a dray floated down the street at a railway pace.  The Creek presents a fearful sight; the water rose in half an hour to an unprecedented height, and those occupying huts excavated in its banks are at this moment floating their furniture out of the holes they have lived in.  Live stock, in the shape of fowls, ducks, and pigs, are going down the Creek for the fastest; and men are seen carrying away little pigs, women and children in all directions, to escape the impending fate of all those who for want of assistance must await the dreaded result of this formidable overflow.  It is reported that an infant belonging to someone living in the creek has met with a watery grave, but of this I can only speak from hearsay.  The goods in the stores and cellars of several tradesmen have already suffered much damage.  It is estimated by the manager of Messrs Boord Brothers’ establishment at Kooringa that their firm will suffer in this instance a loss amounting to upwards of £300.  I can only account for the sudden rush of water on this occasion by the hardness of the surface land, arising from the long absence of rain and the consequent impenetrability of the high grounds in the district, thus causing the waters falling on the surrounding hills to flow almost undiminished down to the valley in which the town is situated.’
