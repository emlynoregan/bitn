Burra North Police Court, 6 June.

John P. McCarthy was charged with using indecent language on 1 June.  He pleaded guilty under provocation and was fined £1 + 10/- costs.

Dorothy May Kakoschke was charged with fighting in a public place on 28 May and pleaded guilty.  She said she was walking down the hill with her three-year-old child and one in a pram when Gladys McGregor rushed at her with the horse she was riding.  Kakoschke had objected to McGregor kissing her boys and McGregor took to hitting her children, even coming into her yard to do so.  When she complained McGregor charged her with the horse and then got off and went for her.  The children hit were only 3-4 years old.  Kakoschke had a doctor’s certificate to prove the injuries received.

Sentence was withheld until the charge against McGregor was heard.

McGregor pleaded not guilty.

Sgt Edington had been called to the defendant’s mother’s house (Mrs O’Brien) and found the defendant on the sofa in a semi-hysterical condition, with a bruise on her temple.  Her version of the altercation said she was coming up the hill on her horse when Kakoschke hit her horse on the nose with a stick and had thrown a brick at her.  Dr Steele had been called.  Edington searched, but could find no sign of a brick that would fit the story.

Mrs O’Brien said her daughter had been beaten with a whip and left unconscious on the road, but the only mark on her appeared to be the bruise allegedly from the brick.  Edington then detailed the marks on Mrs Kakoschke and a ripped sleeve.  The case was adjourned after the prosecution case.
