BURRA MINE ACCIDENT

On Tuesday 3 April at 4.20am the second length of the main pumping rod at Morphett's Shaft broke 6-8 fathoms down and `the engine came indoors'. The cast iron bob of the pump weighed 30 tons and on the break the inner end came down with great force in the pump house. The spring beams of sound timber 2'10" deep and 14.5" wide were smashed and the piston cracked in several places. The building had only recently been strengthened; otherwise considerable damage could have been expected to it as well. It was expected that repairs could be done on site.

Water at once began accumulating in the mine and all underground working had to be suspended. The pump will be out of action `for some considerable time'
