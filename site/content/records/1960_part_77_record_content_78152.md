This year there were 42 members and an average attendance of 22.  The short period of tenure of Mr Howard Groome was productive and he was a sincere and capable leader.  Sports Day in April allowed the Club to raise $268.  A Tabloid Sports Day was held in November and was generally acclaimed as a preferable format.  Other fund raising for the year brought in $319.  $826 has been provided for the purchase of equipment and the present bank balance is $245.  [The various guest speakers are reported.]
