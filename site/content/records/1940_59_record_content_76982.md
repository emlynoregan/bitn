Fire.  A fire on Saturday burnt 2,000 acres of grass at Mt Bryan.  It started on Mr Wedding’s property and burnt from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., moving 1½ miles on a ¼ mile front.  It then crossed the range towards Mt Bryan, almost under control, but a sudden wind gust took it rapidly down the eastern slopes towards Mr Gebhardt’s homestead and fanning out to the north.  As it reached Gebhardt’s the wind changed and took it to Thomas’s homestead.  It jumped the road on either side of the house, but the home and sheds were saved.  About 100 units and several hundred men were by then fighting the blaze.  It moved north on a 1 mile front in inaccessible country.  Mr H. Prior’s unit with Messrs Disher Sen., Arthur Talent and Les Schliebs, was trapped between the fire, a break just started and a fence.  They escaped when ‘Snip’ Prior reversed quickly through the fire, but unfortunately Arthur Talent fell from the vehicle and suffered extensive burns to arms, face and hair, while Les Schliebs had minor burns to the face.  Talent is recovering in Burra Hospital.  F.H. Reed, Superintendent from Burra also had a narrow escape.  The fire burnt part of Ron Murray’s property and was close to his homestead.  It also burnt about 10 acres on G.G. Lines & Sons’ property.  It was controlled late in the afternoon.
