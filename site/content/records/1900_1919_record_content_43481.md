French Red Cross benefited by c. £54 from efforts at Hallett 2 October.  There was a sale of gifts and Mr John Melrose presented a beautiful French Flag that was sold first on the Bugler system and then outright.  Mr H.W. Tiver bought it for £21.  In the evening a social was held for the Hallett Boys going to the front.  Those able to attend were: Bert Bass, Stan Pearce, Dave McDonald, Peter Finlay & Jos. Statton.  Bob Honan, George Prior, Jack Lewis & Charley Simmons are expected back later.
