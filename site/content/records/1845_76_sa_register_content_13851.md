‘A Shepherd’ writes concerning the news he recently received, apparently rather delayed due to his remoteness, of the tax on shepherds’ dogs.  This he believes is set at 10/- p.a. for each dog over six months of age, but with additional fees will effectively be 14/-.  This is an outrageous imposition on shepherds for whom a dog or dogs are as much an essential tool of trade as is a needle for a tailor.  He estimates that there must be 10,000 sheep and cattle dogs in the colony.  He asks the editor to confirm the truth of the rumour about this tax.  If true it is a very serious imposition on ‘a shepherd, with family of five, and rations for two, with £40 per year.’
