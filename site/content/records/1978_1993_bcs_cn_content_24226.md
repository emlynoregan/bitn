Merino Capital of the World Committee

In eight months of operation:

The display at the Stud Merino Field Day was well received.

The display in front of the Tourist Office for National Wool Day was a great success when c. 300 witnessed blade shearing â€“ many for the first time.

There has been a display for some time in the old Bible Christian chapel in Paxton square.

With the upgrading of the upstairs section of the Tourist Office there will soon be a display there.
