Obituary and Inquest into the fatal accident at Baldina Creek: held at Redruth Courthouse 17 August before W.R. Ridgway JP and a jury of six with W.H. Linkson as foreman.

Daniel O’Brien was found lying under a capsized cart at Baldina creek on the previous day.  He was identified by his son Patrick O’Brien of Emu Downs.

William Prosser found the capsized spring cart and the body about 10 o’clock on the 16 August.  The horse was lying on its side, alive, and O’Brien was under the cart with his legs protruding.

Michael Francis Moylan & John Sampson had seen the deceased at Kooringa hotel and he had left at c. 5 p.m.

The P-C Robert Mack concluded that that the horse had been trotting round in circles on the bank and then gone down the cutting, the driver being asleep or short-sighted.  The damage to the deceased’s head had been done either in the accident or from a horse’s kick.

The verdict was accidental death by capsizing of a spring cart.

[Died 15 August aged 57.]
