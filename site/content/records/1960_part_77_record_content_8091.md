Burra Town Council

An invitation was received from the Trustees of the Redruth Methodist Church for Councillors to attend the unveiling of the C.E. Gare Plaque at Burra North on 17 September.

Permission was given for the Small Bore Club to hold a shoot on Sunday 1 October.

It was resolved that the Burra Basketball Club be responsible for power used to light the court.

A letter of appreciation is to be sent to Dr R. Rischbieth of Church Terrace for his sending the trowel used to lay the foundation stone of the Town Hall.
