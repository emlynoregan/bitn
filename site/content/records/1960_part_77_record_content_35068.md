Weather

Hailstones from the storm a fortnight ago were still intact after fourteen days.  Large volumes of hailstones washed up against fences and collected in watercourses.  The survival of the hail was first noticed by Messrs Richard Riggs and Brian Woodman when repairing sections of damaged fencing on the property of B.A. Riggs at the end of last week; some 8-10 days after the storm.  Some hail remained where it had been washed along the fencing with silt.  The main area, however, still to be seen, is around the edge of a dam on P.J. Thomas’s property adjoining that of Mr Riggs.  During the week a large tin of hail was brought in by Bruce Woodman and many people observed its contents at the Record office.  Mr Riggs also had a container of them till Monday.  Inspection yesterday at 1.30 p.m. found quite a large mass of the hailstones still present at the water’s edge.  Though the top was covered by a slight layer of silt, the whole mass is fully exposed to the weather and a handful of singular crystal ice particles was easily obtained.  A phone call to the Bureau of Meteorology confirmed that this was an uncommon event and the temperature would have to be constantly 40°F or below for them to have survived for so long.  Also in the debris from the flood Messrs Riggs & Woodman found a large number of frogs, toads and small snakes up to two feet long.  The hailstones look like being there for some time yet.
