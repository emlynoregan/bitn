Christmas.  Business reported good trading before and on Christmas Eve when the town was crowded with people.  Burra District Band came out on several occasions and late on Christmas Eve played several numbers before adjourning to the home of their President E.F. Marston where they were entertained to supper.  They had also visited Aberdeen where in an interlude in the music the Mayor conveyed to the town his Christmas message and greetings for the New Year.

The holidays were quiet except for the sports organised at Victoria Park by the Burra Cycling & Athletic Club, which drew a fair crowd, though not the number planned and hoped for.  The World’s End Gorge drew the usual crowd of picnickers who had a good time bathing and playing tennis.
