Boy Scouts

This important organisation for the boys has long felt the need of a drill hall of its own or a room for their meetings.  On Saturday 28 September a crowd gathered in Market Square and marched to Aberdeen to take part in the laying of the foundation stone for the new building.  The stone was laid by the Mayor and donations of £60 were laid on the stone and £8 came from afternoon tea.  Membership has risen from 18 to 42 in three years.
