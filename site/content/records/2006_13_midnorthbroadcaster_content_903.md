Burra Hospital Auxiliary held its AGM last Friday.  The Melbourne Cup Luncheon in November raised $2,189.  A trading table raised $518 and a barbecue $151.  Among other donations, a generous $6,000 came from Di Day from her ‘Miss Personality Quest’ winnings.  Three electric beds costing $8,800 and a combi steamer worth $13,800 were donated to the hospital.
