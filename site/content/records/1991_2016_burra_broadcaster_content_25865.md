Letter.  Meredith Satchell writes, calling for Burra history and historical photographs.  She is aiming to produce a digital book telling the history of the last 100 years with two pages per year â€“ one page of text and one A4 size photograph.  She would like to hear from anyone else researching Burra history and especially anyone with photos and /or information representative of the town or district from a particular year.
