Burra Town Council.

The Government will advance the total cost of the bridge opposite the Institute, but half will have to be repaid in five equal annual instalments.

Cr Radford thought the Government was very reasonable and suggested they be asked to finance the bridge at Gully’s on the same terms.

Cr McBride thought it would be cheeky, but Cr Radford was serious and so moved.

Cr McWaters thought it absurd.  A bridge was not needed in Aberdeen.  It would only be used for the show and races.  He moved as an amendment that the request be not sent.  Carried.

Mrs Richards of the [Court House] Hotel, Aberdeen [i.e. Redruth] was given permission to keep pigs.

Bridgers Ltd said they could not raise capital to construct an electric light scheme during the war, but would happily negotiate on the matter after the war.

Mr Winnall explained the lease of the creek to Hon. John Lewis.  It was for 99 years, giving the lessee right of way for stock from Kingston St Bridge to below the Mill for £3-15-0 p.a. or 5% interest on the money paid for the creek.  The portions needed were shown on a plan: the rest could be fenced and planted.

Cr Killicoat was against a lease, saying it ought to be open to all as a stock route.  The lessee could block the route to others.  Mr Winnall did not think Mr Lewis could block other users, but he could impound straying stock or stock at large on it.

Cr Radford was concerned as well, apparently along similar lines to Cr Killicoat.

Mr Winnall thought Mr Lewis would agree to the route being a right of way for all travelling stock.

Cr Killicoat said that no lease was needed; let the route be a proclaimed stock route for all time.

Mr Lewis will be asked if he would be satisfied with no lease, but it being proclaimed a public right of way and so registered on the deed.

Mr Winnall pointed out that Mr Lewis had given the Council the option of purchasing the creek on the condition he got the lease.

Dr Ashton submitted plans for a surgery and residence in Kooringa.  Approved.
