‘A New-comer’ writes on Runs on Crown Lands

Gentlemen, having lately come here, and being disappointed in my expectations, I am induced to express myself in your paper.  Before I left home I was led to believe that good land was available here at £1 per acre.  I found that land-jobbers had taken all the best land and were asking £4-£5 per acre.  Going north, I found unmeasured field suitable for my needs, but again I was met with disappointment when I was informed that gentlemen occupiers would not allow the sale of small quantities of land to strangers.  I observed the names of some half dozen monopolists.  I was amazed by the numbers of small stockholders whose stock was dying for want of feed, when hundreds of thousands of acres, with grass rotting or being burnt, might be obtained by application through the proper channels.  It cannot be expected that the Governor would be aware of such an astounding fact and having no practical men to ascertain the numbers of stock on these runs accounts for this injustice to the public.  Let a man of experience be appointed to survey all runs for stock and let all surplus land be open for selection as runs for stock.  I believe that in the district I referred to 150,000 more sheep could be well fed.  I hear Mr Dutton holds 200 square miles of land for a yearly rental of £5.  This enormous occupancy is defended on the ground that it is no more than the law allows for his stock.  This area contains 128,000 acres or 1,600 sections of 80 acres each, which would make so many farms and homesteads for so many families.  At an average of five persons per family this would amount to 8,000 souls, instead of 30-40 shepherds and hut-keepers.

How long is this melancholy state of things to continue, by which the industrious and legitimate settler is deprived of his rights?
