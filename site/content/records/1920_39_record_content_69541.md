Fascism.  A column is reprinted from the Kadina & Wallaroo Times.

‘Lifting the Lid off Spain.’  It concludes that ‘Intelligent people can no longer doubt that the threat to peace comes from the Fascist countries.’

[This contrasts with columns in the earlier 1930s that were strongly pro-Mussolini.]
