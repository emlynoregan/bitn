St Mary’s Vestry Meeting.

The meeting heard that the Sunday school was flourishing and the parish’s Mission Churches were doing well.  The church had received gifts: an eagle lectern from Mr & Mrs A. McCulloch, silver side vessels from Mr & Mrs C. Sandland, a new Bible from Mr & Mrs W.P. Barker, a velvet alms bag from Mrs J.E.H. Winnall.

The last strawberry fete raised £105 and £70 of it went to the organ fund.  The rest went to lay water to the rectory and to erect a fence between the church and the Sunday school.  Weekly services were conducted at the Hospital and Redruth Reformatory.  This year’s strawberry fete funds are to be used as follows: £10 to the organ fund, to plaster the Sunday school room, to renovate and clean the interior of the church and the rest on a shelter shed.
