New Year’s Eve passed without any larrikinism at all in the town and even walls and shutters survived unmarked.  But at Copperhouse a cart was placed in a wagon and several vehicles moved from their usual places.  At 12 tins, guns and other noisy things were heard and in the street the anthem Hail to the Newborn King.
