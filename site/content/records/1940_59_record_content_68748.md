Gum Creek School held an Arbor Day, which is reported in Â½ column.

It turned out to be too wet to plant the trees, but there were talks, a film Trees of Australia and coloured slides of Australian trees.  A fortnight later, on 6 September [!], the trees were planted at Leighton Oval.  Three gums were planted to complete a row of twelve red gums begun in 1953 and 15 Aleppo Pines were also planted.
