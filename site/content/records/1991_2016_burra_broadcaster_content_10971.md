Burra Hospital Board held its last AGM after 119 years and with the anticipation of amalgamation with Clare & Snowtown to form the Burra-Clare-Snowtown Health Service, Chairman John Brak read the final annual report.

Burra is now located within the Wakefield Region, which encompasses the previous Yorke Peninsula, Lower North and Barossa Regions.  The Wakefield Regional Health Service will be responsible for its own budget, which includes budgets for each hospital in the region.

[Further details of the changes are provided in the report of Lesley Phillips CEO and Director of Nursing and extend over some two columns.]
