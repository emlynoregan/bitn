[1 This is often asserted, or at least a similar figure is claimed.  In fact there have been 17 hotels in the town, if Copperhouse is included, but they did not operate simultaneously.  The greatest number at any one time would seem to have been between 1859 and 1866, when there were 10 and one of those was at Copperhouse.  From 1854 to 1858 there were 8, though not the same 8 for all those years.  There have been 5 since 1921.]
