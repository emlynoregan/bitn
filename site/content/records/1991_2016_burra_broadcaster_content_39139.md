Pedestrian Refuge in Commercial Street.  Work was expected to start this week.

An Off-Leash Dog Park is planned for ‘Scroop Park’ [Lowe Park] on Smelts Road at Burra North.  The plans are for one area for large dogs and another for smaller ones.

The Old Jinker is to get a new shelter in the form of a sturdy and attractive structure, with peripheral paving and a viewing area for tourists.

Earthquake.  A 3.1 magnitude quake was recorded on 2 April at c. 1.30 with an epicentre c. 7 km northeast of Burra.  There have been a series of minor quakes earlier and the last significant one was a 5.1 magnitude quake in 1997.
