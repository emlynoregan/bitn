Floods.  The creek through West Ward overflowed twice during the December rains.  On 28 December following 133 points in 20 minutes and secondly on 30 December when 58 points fell in 30 minutes.  Debris from the first flood and trees growing in the creek made the second flooding worse.  Water ran down Commercial Street 6 inches deep and then flowed down the full width of Thames Street.  Some damage was done to businesses in Commercial Street.
