Burra Burra DC, April meeting.

A letter from the Institutes’ Assoc. with title on Hanson Property and a cheque for the residue of funds from the Hanson Institute.  [Presumably this is the final act in ending the Hanson Institute after which it continued as simply a hall.]

Booborowie Institute.  Anama Pastoral Co. has offered half shares in 120 acres of cropland for the coming season.  (Last year’s crop produced over 1,000 bags of barley on adjacent land from Anama.)  The proprietors will find all the seed and half the super, half the bags and do the carting.  The Institute will be responsible for all the work and sew all the bags.  The cereal to be 2 row barley.

The Institute accepted the offer at a public meeting at the Institute on Tuesday night.  Volunteers were called for and obtained.
