Fire Brigade.  A meeting on Monday to discuss forming a fire brigade drew surprisingly few in view of the events of recent months.  Volunteers were called for and Messrs Truscott, J. Allen, G. Burns, S.M. Lane, A.J. Collins, Wilson, J.W. Bowen, A.J. Gebhardt, M.A. Radford, F. Moore and L. Lihou handed in their names.  Mr Truscott was elected captain and E.J. Davey the Hon. Sec.  It was decided to ask the Burra Coppermining Co. for the mine fire-bell and the leather buckets lying around the mine.  We note that in 1885 the Record strongly recommended the formation of a fire brigade.
