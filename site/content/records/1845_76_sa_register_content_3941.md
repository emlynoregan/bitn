4 October

Christina McPherson charged John Brash with breaking down her door and assaulting her on 2 October.  After describing the event and the damage to her furniture as well, complainant called a man named Ballman, who confirmed the property damage.

Brash said McPherson had left her husband in England to come to SA with him.  When he heard a manâ€™s voice inside the house he had told her to turn the man out.  McPherson had dragged him inside and Ballman had struck him; the furniture was broken in the scuffle.

The Magistrate considered the complaint proved, fined Brash 20/- and ordered him to pay 28/- for damage to the furniture and 22/- costs and to be bound over to keep the peace for three months.
