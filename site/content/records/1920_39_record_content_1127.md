Rev. D.B. Bridgwood was farewelled last Thursday at Jubilee Hall.  After four years in the Redruth circuit he is about to go to Gumeracha.  J.G. Sara presided.  Mr Dunhill as Superintendent of the Sunday school spoke in particular of Mr Bridgwood’s work.  R. Fuss spoke on behalf of the choir, thanking Rev. Bridgwood for his support of the choir as a means of bringing people into the church.  Cr Radford spoke on behalf of the citizens of Burra and with respect to the Bridgwoods’ patriotic work and their support for Mr Crewes during the war years.  Rev. G.K. Haslam spoke for the Kooringa circuit and W. Woollacott for local preachers and Mr Tiddy for church officers.  Mrs H.H. Thomas then presented a wallet containing 21 notes.  Rev. Bridgwood said this was his 19th removal and the next would be his last.  He thanked everyone for their good wishes and was glad to see the ‘Hampton Court’ girls were present.  He was especially thankful for Mr James Reed’s presentation of £1,000 towards a new Sunday school and he wished he was in better health and so more equal to the occasion.

Miss Bubb expressed her deep gratitude for the Bridgwoods’ many acts of kindness and visits to Hampton Court School.  Mr & Mrs George Hann represented St Mary’s.
