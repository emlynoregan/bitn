A Letter from the Diggings: Forest Creek Mount Alexander, 7 March 1852.

[This is quite a long letter, from which I note a few points.]

It took four days to walk to the diggings from Melbourne.

It was seven miles from the head of the diggings to where the writer was working.

Fryer’s Creek and the Lodden were equally extensive. Bendigo Creek was about 30 miles off and people were going there because of better water and feed for the horses.

The ten acres site where the writer was working had two or three holes a fortnight ago and now there was not a foot of level space left.

He was carting their stuff 4 miles to get water to wash it and it costs16/- -20/- per half a ton.

The dust was intolerable.

In a week his group of three had won 6 oz 17 dwt, which he thought a good beginning.  (In a post-script written three days later he says they then had 1 lb 15 dwt.)

Since Mr Tolmer’s visit the price of gold had risen.  Previously it was £2-16-0 to £2-18-0 per oz and had then risen to £3 or more.  (Tolmer was guaranteeing £3-11-0.)

Water there was scarce and drying up and their tent by a good water hole was about four miles from their work.

Provisions were excessively dear, except for meat.  Feed for horses was also dear and hay not to be had.  Even the sheet of paper he was writing on had cost him 3d.
