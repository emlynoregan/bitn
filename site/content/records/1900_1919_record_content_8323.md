W.H. Hardy waited upon the Hon. L. O’Loghlin and Mr William Miller at the Burra Railway Station on Monday in reference to the petition presented last week to the Premier, the Hon. J.C. Jenkins.  They said a reply from the Commissioner of Public Works is expected this week.  They believe the Aberdeen Ballast Quarry may be opened again shortly and other work found outside the town.  Men with two horse drays could find work at Ucolta at present.
