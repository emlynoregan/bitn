‘Ratepayer’ writes suggesting the proposed Maternity Wing at Burra Hospital is a disadvantage.  Will the donors be paying for the equipping of the ward and its staffing?  Users of the ward will have to pay and also be taxed for it.  The ratepayers have not been consulted.  It will remove the living from the maternity nurses in Burra.  The Isolation Ward is much needed and does not interfere with the good private maternity homes.
