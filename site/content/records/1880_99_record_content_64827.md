Burra Burra Mine.  Boring at the mine continues vigorously and is now down to 800’.  Rich sulphide and sulphate ores were found for the last 20’, becoming softer with depth.  A new and larger boiler has been procured and it is expected this will eliminate the frequent stoppages previously experienced.
