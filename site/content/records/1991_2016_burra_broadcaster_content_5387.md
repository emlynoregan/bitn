Maureen Bevan was accorded a Civic Function on 8 December to honour her contribution and commitment to the management of Paxton Square Cottages over the past decade.  She and her late husband Bryan, were appointed as managers soon after the Bridge Terrace row was restored in 1983.  They saw the complete square restored and made available for holiday accommodation.

Andrew Gebhardt, who was a former Chairman of the Lewis Board, commended Maureen and Bryan for their work.  When work started it was thought a 40% occupancy rate was needed to service the loan.  A staggering 80% rate was achieved and that paved the way to proceed with restoration.

Robyn Page, immediate past Chairman of the Lewis Board, endorsed Andrew’s remarks and described the Bevans as hard working, caring and kind and they achieved a State Tourism Award, which gave Paxton Square national exposure.  Maureen had continued alone after the death of her husband – with the help of her family.

Council Chairman Graham Kellock presented Maureen with a plaque, a certificate and a basket of flowers.
