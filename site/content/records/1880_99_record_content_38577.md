Obituary and Inquest

On Wednesday afternoon the body of John Dolman, farmer of Baldina, was found in Baldina Creek near the ford.  Dolman had set out for Burra with a load of wool and some time later Norman MacLean, who is visiting William Barker of Baldina set out after him to ask him to fetch something back from the town.  He met the wagon a little above the ford, but there was no one in charge.  He stopped the horses, went back to seek Dolman, and found the body.  On informing Mr Barker the latter returned with an employee and at the ford met Harry Vivian of the Commercial Hotel who had gone to meet the Quondong Mail because he had heard the driver was ill.  The police were sent for to collect the body.  The ford was about 15â€™ high above a rock mass where the body was found.  Deceased was well known, having resided at Baldina near the Douglas Primitive Methodist Church for many years.  He was aged 61.
