Mayor E.T. Baulderstone wrote to the paper.  He called for more community effort and involvement in Burra.  He said that having been Mayor for 14 years he would do his best, but it gets harder as he gets older and he needs more help.  Burra lacks the assistance other places get from having a Progress Association, a Junior Chamber of Commerce, Rotary of Apex Clubs.  During the coming year he will be calling a meeting to discuss future arrangements for the Burra & District Swimming Pool.  He will also be seeking help later to form a Tourist Committee, which is important for the town.  He also flags his opinion that Local Government must get bigger to be more efficient and says that his Council has already commenced negotiations with the Burra Burra DC on the subject of a merger.
