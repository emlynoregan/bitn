Linen & Lace has opened in Commercial Street in the shop across Queen Street from the Roadhouse.  Marina Gray established Linen and Lace in Terowie three years ago and has now decided to extend her business by opening a shop in Burra.  She has a range of pretty doilies at around $2, fine examples of Victorian antique lace and a range of functional items.  There is also a small range of bric-a-brac.
