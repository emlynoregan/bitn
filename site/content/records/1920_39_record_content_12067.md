Burra Town Council, 5 November

The Governor sent a letter expressing a wish to meet the Mayor and Council on 24 October.

Bagot, Shakes & Lewis seek a document re a tender for grazing rights given to W.N. James for three years over Burra Creek lands.  They are to be advised that this lease is for grazing only and in no way interferes with Bagot, Shakes & Lewis’s right of way over the same.

C.R. Bevan’s application to build a house was granted.
