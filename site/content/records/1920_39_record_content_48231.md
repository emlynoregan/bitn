Burra Brass Band held its AGM with J. Allen in the chair.  The secretary reported a credit balance of £11-15-0.  In the year the band held a series of dances and one concert in the Institute and gave open-air concerts at Kooringa and Aberdeen and two paid engagements at the RSL sports meeting and a continental at Leighton.  There were also numerous free appearances.  The band was successful at the Spalding Competitions with highest points in march, hymn and selection sections and winning the cup at only their second attempt.

Four players left the district this year: I.C. Halls, Stan Truscott, Don and Keith Turnbull.  Newcomers Colin Clement, Frank Aberg [and someone else not named] joined.  Recently the newly formed Hallett Band visited.  Assets were about £100 of music, 4 cornets, 3 tenor horns, 3 euphoniums, 2 tenor trombones, 1 bass trombone, 3 Eb basses, 1 Bb bass, 1 bass drum, 2 side drums, 14 music stands, 25 uniform coats and 24 caps, 1 E.P. cup.  There were no liabilities.

Thanks to P.W. Clark for the use of his hall at such a low cost.  Elected were Patron, James Thomas; President, E.F. Marston; Hon. Secretary, J.T. Pascoe; Treasurer, J. Allen & Bandmaster, J.H. Murison.

The word ‘District’ was added to the band’s name.  The band will wait on the Council concerning some minor changes to the rotunda to allow the band to play in it.
