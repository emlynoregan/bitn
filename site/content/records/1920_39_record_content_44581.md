Mr & Mrs W.H. Spier and their three little sons and daughter left Kooringa for Unley Park on Sunday and were accorded a farewell at the Council Chamber.  The Mayor made a presentation.  Mr Spier had given much time to the Choral and Operatic Classes.  He had been in the town for 14 years.  The family was also farewelled at the close of the morning service at Kooringa Methodist Church where Rev. Jarvis handed over a wallet of notes.
