Burra Town Council, 18 May.

Town lamps have all been cleaned except for one in Chapel St for which the lighter needed instructions.

The Hydraulic Engineer reported that the water from the old well is very little different from the well in present use and charges could not be reduced as pimping expenses were heavy.

The mayor thought the charges were very high.  The Town Clerk is to get information from other places.

Sincock and Burchell say the land with the dangerous shaft was in the auctioneer’s hands for sale.  Council will fence it and charge the owners.

Council is prepared to set aside the SE portion of the cemetery for Catholic use – an area large enough for 300 burials, but could not see its way clear to fence it in.  The Bishop will be so advised.

As there has been no move on the verandah posts the Council will give a fortnight’s notice before doing the work itself and charging the owners.

The town pump is to be put in repair.

Sincock and Burchell are to be given 7 days’ notice that the old shaft is to be covered and fenced.
