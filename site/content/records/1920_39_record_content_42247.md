Mongolata Goldfield

An article by ‘A Visitor’ describes a visit to the field, praising the hard work of the men who would rather work than be on the dole.  It gives an account of William Carpenter’s ‘Latagomon Restaurant’.  There is no technical information or any facts and figures.  [The style of the article suggests the writer might have been a well-educated woman.]
