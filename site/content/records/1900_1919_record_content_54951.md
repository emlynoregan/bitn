Mr McLaren said he was not appointed as Mayor.

Mr Radford said the Council had thought that he was and it was therefore surprised when he continued in the position.

The amendment was carried on the casting vote of the chairman, Mr A.J. McBride.

The Board agreed that Friendly Soc. members and infectious disease patients should only be admitted under arrangements made with such societies and the Local Board of Health and only patients unable to pay be admitted free of charge and in emergency and accident cases the board should consider each patientâ€™s circumstances.
