Cricket.  At South Booborowie last Saturday.  The paper announces a draw with Burra 90 and South Booborowie 5 for 178.  How this is a draw is a mystery to me, as it was also to [South] Booborowie Cricket Club as a letter to the paper in the next issue demonstrated.  [Though the one-day game had not been invented at the time, it was usual for clubs to agree that the game would be decided on the first innings if two innings were not completed.  It was usual to play out finals.]
