The Influenza epidemic has finally reached Burra and is daily claiming more victims including many of the leading businessmen.  A mild epidemic of chickenpox has swept through the children and some cases of shingles have been reported.

Weather.  Some 62 points of rain locally have been useful to farmers, but to the east the boisterous winds of Wednesday & Thursday last brought dust storms.  Rain is seriously needed in the pastoral areas.
