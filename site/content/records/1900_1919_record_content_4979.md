Burra town Council, 6 January.

News of the death of the Mayor, Mr A. Harris was formally received and arrangements made to fill the vacancy.

The Lamps which grace Henderson’s Bridge, Market Square and the Commercial St Bridge were removed a few nights ago as Mr W. Geake, the new contractor, found when he went to take up his duties.  A night or two later the Market Square lamp was placed in the glass enclosure on the Commercial St Bridge with a new wick.  The lamps have now been recovered and no further action will be taken.

The Burra Mine.  The question of the mine’s reopening has gone as dead as a doornail.  Shareholders of the Burra Burra Copper Co. are anxious to know what is going on.  When Shares were on the market it was stated that work would commence at once.  We understand a meeting of shareholders will be held soon.

Burra Slag Extraction Co. has been hit by low copper prices and a discouraging return of copper from operations in the past month or two and it has ceased operations for one month, throwing 30-40 men and boys out of work.
