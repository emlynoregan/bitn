Editorial on the W.J. Richards case.  The Corporation was obliged to defend the case strongly as it could ill afford to have a precedent set in such a matter.  During the case it came to light that there is no by-law forbidding riding a bicycle on a foot path.  We understand this matter will be attended to.
