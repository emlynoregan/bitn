Burra Town Council, 25 October [sic: presumably in error for 5 October.]

The pound-keeper has resigned and a joint committee with the DC is set up to resolve what to do.

Mr Dollman of the Burra Motor Co. was given permission to erect a bowser.

Sara & Co. were given permission to erect a bowser in front of their shop.

‘After discussion it was decided to allow Drew & Crewes’ permission to put down lamp [sic] for “bowser” in their right-of-way, also erect same in the street.’  [Presume ‘tank’ for ‘lamp’!]

Cr Kellaway moved that the guns be removed from Market Square.  They were no ornament he said.  One should go into the park opposite the Institute and the other to Aberdeen.

Cr Harris & Cr Woollacott supported him.

Cr Riggs moved that they stay and this was seconded by Cr Kellock.

Cr Hammond (in the chair) said that if he had a deliberative vote he would have opposed.

The motion was then changed to: ‘It is the desire of the Council that the guns be removed.’  Carried.
