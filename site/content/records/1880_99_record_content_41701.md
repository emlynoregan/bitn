Cr Sampson moved a ladder be got for lighting lamps.  Carried.

Cr Sampson moved that the lamppost in Market Square be moved to Henderson’s Corner and another burner be substituted for the one now in use.  Carried.

Cr Sampson said he had seen Mr Lewis and told him that for £20 they would take the matter of diverting the water entirely out of his hands and divert it.  Mr Lewis declined.

In fairness to Mr Lockyer who had cleared out the watercourse the council should either remove the soil or compel Mr Lewis to do so.  Four or five notices had been served on Mr Lewis and he would move ‘That Council put men on at once to clean out the obstruction to the creek so as to let the water go through its natural channel.’

Cr Watt said Mr Lewis had undertaken to give £15.

Cr Sampson: Will Cr Watt guarantee it?

Cr Watt believed Mr Lewis a man of his word.

Cr Rabbich did not want to accept £15 as he felt it would be insufficient.

After further discussion on serving further notices Cr Watt moved the £15 offer be accepted and despite Cr Rabbich’s objections it was carried.

The work is to be done as soon as the £15 is received.
