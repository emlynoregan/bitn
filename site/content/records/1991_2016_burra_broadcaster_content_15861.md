Burra Golf Club has almost completed stage 1 of its course redevelopment.  Recently Darryl Venning (President) turned on the water pipeline that will supply water via a creek to the dam, recently completed as part of the beautification of the western side of the course.  Water from the dam will be used to green the fairways and tees and later for the greens.  A creek has been made from the Barrier Highway area to run water from the pipeline to the dam.  Soil from the dam site will now be used as a base for the tees and greens.  Eventually holes 3 & 4 will be repositioned to give 8 holes on the east side of the highway and 10 on the western side, with holes 9 and 18 finishing at the clubhouse.
