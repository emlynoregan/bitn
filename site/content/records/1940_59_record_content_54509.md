Victoria Park was the site of a successful working bee over the weekend.  Water has been laid on to the change rooms, a portion of which has been partitioned off to make two large change rooms and a shower room.  Conveniences are in the hands of L. Kellaway.  Mr Pritchard has burnt out some tree stumps.  After some grading by the District Council, it is hoped to make provisions for a basketball court.  [A list of those who helped is printed.]
