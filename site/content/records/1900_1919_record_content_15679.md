Rabbits are in plague proportions to the east.  Netting of dams is catching hundreds each night and one person reported getting 1,850 in an hour.  At Thistlebeds it is easy on a hot day to knock over 300-400 as they come to water.  Rabbiters can be seen in almost every paddock.  Some are working for wages, some for scalps and carcases.  The latter are for export, but the weather is now against this.  One rabbiter was bringing in 2,000 on Thursday, but the heat beat him and they had to be unloaded.  As many as 45 rabbits are being taken from a single burrow.  The Burra District Council last meeting decided to buy several drums of poison to assist in eradication.  [On page 5 there is a claim that someone killed over 2,000 in an hour.]
