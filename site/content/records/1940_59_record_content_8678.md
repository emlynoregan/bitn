Boxing Day started with an electrical storm bringing plenty of wind and torrential rain.  Over 60 points were recorded at Burra.  Humid and uncomfortably hot conditions prevailed for the day, with another storm about 5.30 p.m.  This brought strong winds and further heavy rain to bring the dayâ€™s total to 93 points.  Cooler conditions prevailed for a day or two, but the heat has returned.

Copperhouse School held a Christmas Tree Evening that was well attended.  Father Christmas (T. Villis) handed out gifts to the children and this was followed by ice cream for all.  The students presented items.  Qualifying Certificates were presented to Lindsay Kakoschke and Barbara Rogers.  Lindsay was School Dux.

[Other prize winners are listed.]  Glen Finch on behalf of the School Committee and the Welfare Club announced the departure of the Head Teacher Mr K. Murdoch, who was wished every happiness in his new home.  A mulga inkstand was presented to Mr Murdoch and a set of spoons to his wife.  Supper and dancing followed.
