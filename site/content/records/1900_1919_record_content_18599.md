The Old Smelts.  Not long ago Messrs Martin & Co. of Gawler successfully extracted copper by treating the old slag heap.  Now a gentleman proposes to treat the fine stuff and on paper it appears all right.  Samples have been sent away for assay and it is believed it is the intention to float a company.
