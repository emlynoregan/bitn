Obituary – Murder - Suicide: The Cavenagh Tragedy.

On Monday the two eldest sons of the Thyer family at Nackara returned home and found their father hanging from a gallows erected for slaughtering cattle.  In the house they found the bodies of five children and their mother.  Some of the victims had their heads battered in and others their throats cut.  The deceased are: 	Elizabeth Thyer	36

Florence Thyer	12

Edward Thyer	9

Alexander Thyer	7

Charles Thyer	6

Roy Thyer	4 months

The perpetrator, Joseph Thyer, was the eldest son of James Thyer, owner of Wabricoola Station and of a freehold property between Lancelot and Petersburg.  He had always been a pastoralist and was a hard worker, an affectionate husband and a kind father.  He had no money troubles, but for the last six months had been troubled and on two or three occasions had attempted suicide.

The jury concluded he had committed the murders and suicide while of unsound mind.

The late Mrs Thyer was a sister to Mrs J. Ellery and to Mr C. Collins of Gum Creek Station.  Thyer had often visited Burra in charge of stock and Mrs Thyer was also a periodical visitor, the last occasion being only a few weeks ago.

The funeral took place at Dawson.  There were five coffins with the two boys put in two and two.  Mrs Thyer and the children were buried in one grave 7’ x 7’ and Mr Thyer was buried apart.
