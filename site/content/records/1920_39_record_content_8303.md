Burra & District Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial Committee met 24 July.  Promises amounting to £45-10-0 were unpaid.  There was discussion about the two guns, which were the property of the Town Council and some of the committee were clearly of the opinion they were being imposed upon.  E.J. Harris said ‘The Committee did not contemplate the expense of painting the guns’.  Mr Crewes (President) said traffic was cutting up the road around the memorial and it could not be left unfinished.  Mr Radford said this could be resolved by placing the guns nearer the memorial.

The last estimate for a Roll of Honour was £210.

Dr Steele thought they would have to combine with the Council concerning the garden or other surrounds for the memorial.  The feeling was that the Roll of Honour required first priority.  A fresh estimate was called for.  Funds will be called for.  Mr P.A. McBride had promised a cheque and Miss Sandland will organise a concert.

Council will be asked to place a gun on the north side facing north and one on the south side facing the Rotunda as near as convenient to the memorial.

F. Harris will sell postcards of the contents laid under the memorial for 3d.

Mr Dane was thanked for his extensive work as secretary.
