Burra Printing Press.  At a meeting on 21 June a small group inspected the items from the old Burra printery and discussed the future of this important part of Burraâ€™s history.  It was decided to shift all small items like tray of type, point blocks and old copies of the Burra Record into temporary storage at Burra North Police Station until a permanent home can be found.  The printing press and linotype machine will stay in place for the time being.  The appeal for funds has reached $3,320 with a target of $6,000.
