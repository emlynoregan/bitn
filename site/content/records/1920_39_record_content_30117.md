Hallett Methodist Kindergarten Hall foundation stone was laid on Wednesday 20 March by Mrs S.C. Seigert, [Siegert] nee Miss Elsie Statton.  Drought and the war had long delayed the building which had been needed since the kindergarten started in 1915.  Funds in the town had then gone to a memorial porch and window and then to a new Institute.  They had 40 children and had first used the old Institute and now the new Masonic Temple.  A knife and fork spread followed at the Institute with a concert in the evening.  [Details occupy 1â…“ columns.]
