St Andrew’s Church Mt Bryan.

[There is a long and interesting if at times confused article on Anglican History in the Burra District occupying 1¼ columns.]

This is the first church built in the St Mary’s Mission District.  The Church of the Ascension at Black Springs was bought from the District Council 17 [sic] years ago in the time of Rev. A.G. King, for £50. [In view of the dedication date this figure might be an error for 7 years ago.]  It had previously been a Methodist Church, a dwelling, a District Council Chamber and various other things.  It was thoroughly renovated and dedicated by Bishop Harmer 22 September 1908.

[The text here becomes garbled and the dates impossible to reconcile.  It says the missions at the time were two in number – in the same year increased to three when T.H. Bailey allowed his Gum Creek schoolroom to be used for services.  The text then says that in 1907 there were four missions and Mt Bryan is the youngest.]

It continues by saying there are now six missions with Farrell’s Flat being added the year before last, covering an area from Booborowie to Mt Bryan East and Farrell’s Flat to Ulooloo.  To the north it adjoins the Hundred of Hallett and the southern boundary of the new Diocese of Willochra, whose first bishop is to be appointed on 26 January 1915.

[Though not specified, it would seem from the above that the six missions were then: Gum Ck, Farrell’s Flat, Black Springs, Hallett, Mt Bryan and Booborowie, unless Mt Bryan East was a separate entity.]

In 1890, the last year that St Mary’s stood alone without mission churches, the income was put at £1,369 – more than for any other church in SA, partly because in that year the debt of £825 was abolished.  The Bishop’s Home Mission Society assisted the Hallett Mission by £4 in 1891 and now helps by £70.

At Mt Bryan, five years ago services were held in the Institute, even carrying the organ across the railway line for services.

The new church opens with a debt of £150, having spent £460 on building and furniture.  The Ven. Archdeacon Bussell officiated.  W.B. Page, organist of St Mary’s, played for the service of dedication.

The stone comes from the Burra quarries of Henry Thomas.  The nave is 30’ x 19’ and rises 25’6” to the ridge.  The chancel is in the form of an apse.

Donors of various furnishings are then listed.
