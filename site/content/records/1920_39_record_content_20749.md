Market Square Changes.  The meeting on 13 September was very poorly attended.  Only two members of the public joined the RSL and Council representatives.  The Mayor was surprised that the controversy generated had not caused more people to attend.  The Mayor feared that raising the £350 to £400 needed to complete the project would be very difficult, though he hoped it could be done.

Dr Steele had nothing to add to the report in the Record of the proposal and he was confident that the old feeling that raised money for the Memorial was not yet extinct.

Mr S.M. Lane was concerned about the traffic flow, but Dr Steele said the plan was not to extend the fence far beyond the Rotunda.

The Mayor said the Council was prohibited by the Act from donating more than £50.

Cr Riggs explained that as Chairman of Public Works Committee he was empowered to carry out the scheme passed by the Council to relocate the guns to opposite the Institute and this would be done if it was found impossible to carry out the enclosure scheme.  A committee was then appointed.
