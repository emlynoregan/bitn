Burra Hospital Board

Concerning the responsible medical officer position: Dr Steven has declined the position.  W.G. Hawkes, Chairman was totally opposed to any payment for the position.  Mr Kellock said it involved 24 nights a year in lectures and it ought to be paid.  Mr Davey did not want any appointment.  [Though the Government rules require it.]  Messrs Melrose & Kellock proposed Dr Steele.  Dr Morris had recently said it was necessary and that the medical officer should be consulted on appointments or dismissals of higher members of staff.  [A clear reference to the recent dismissal of the matron.]

Mr Davey moved Dr Steven be appointed for six months and Dr Steele for the rest of the year.  Seconded by Mr Morgan.  An amendment altered this to appointment to 30 June 1924 and this was carried.

Mr Davey was opposed to any payment.  Mr Melrose moved for a payment of £50 which was seconded by Mr Kellock, opposed by the chairman and lost.

There was debate over responsibility for payment of an infectious case – over whether or not the Local Board of Health was liable.  Referred back to the Local Board of Health.
