After the Mayor had read his report Alexander Harris wanted to know if there had been any difficulty in procuring wood for the Waterworks.

Council had just agreed to take 25 tons at 13/- a ton.

Mr Harris wanted to know why the price had risen from 10/- to 13/- a ton.

The Mayor said that the cost of feed for horses had considerably increased and in Adelaide carters’ prices had risen 6d a day.

Mr Harris started to make a statement, but was constrained by the chair to asking questions only.

When he tried to suggest that the price was unfair the chairman suggested that perhaps the unfairness lay elsewhere.

The Mayor said Mr Nankivell, the contractor, had been bringing in wood from 20 miles at 10/- a ton at a positive loss and so in fairness the Council had decided to give him a 25-ton order at 13/-.

Mr Crewes moved the adoption of the report and Mr C. Fuss 2nd.

Mr Harris said he thought they were spending public money in a different manner from how they would spend their own.

Cr Sampson said the Waterworks had seen a saving of £100, so there wasn’t much to grumble about: ‘there was a certain person in the room who didn’t care who went under the water so long as he kept on top’. (Applause)

He thought 13/- a fair thing.

‘Mr Harris: Would you give it?

Cr Sampson: Yes, do you think I’m like you? – (Laughter)

You are only giving 7s per ton for wood.  (laughter)

Mr Harris: That is nothing to do with you.  (Laughter)

A voice: Yes, certainly it is.’

[The exchange continued somewhat longer.]

Mr West was the only candidate present to give an account of his stewardship.  He said the accounts spoke well for the economic management of the Council.  The year had been a peaceful one and the Mayor and Councillors had worked harmoniously together.

The Mayor said he had reluctantly consented to stand again.  The next year would see them out of debt and then rates might be reduced.  His action with respect to the wood was the same as it would have been had he been dealing with it in private life.  This coming year would assuredly be his last in office.  He apologised for the absence of Cr Pederson, who was ill in hospital, but Cr Pederson would contest the election if it were the wish of ratepayers.

Cr West would stand again.

Mr H.S. Dunn would be a candidate for North Ward.  He had no great policies, but would deal with whatever came before Council to the best of his ability.

Mr Snell thought the high rates were driving people to leave the town.

There were some further exchanges over rates and the meeting closed.
