Fire.  At 4 a.m. on 24 January Mr W. Harris, general dealer of Chapel St awoke to find his store on fire and as the ceiling was zinc the smoke was moving into his attached house.  He got his wife and children out, but the building is a total loss.  The building and stock were insured for £200 and £500 respectively.

It is thought that a pan of milk taken off the fire and set to cool on a box may have had a cinder on its bottom.  The same premises were burnt down some years ago when occupied by Mr Dunstan.  This shows the importance of the town’s getting a fire reel, which it is still waiting for.
