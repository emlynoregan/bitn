Booborowie Visiting Day & Back to School.  A small scale back to school and prize giving was held on Friday.  Some came dressed in school togs.  Old scholars were welcomed.  Rev. Dyer thought this taste of the real thing might stimulate the desire for a Back to School on a larger scale.  A procession was formed from the school to the hall where each class had a stall to show off their work.  A knife and fork tea was provided with old scholars being served first and then the present ones.  A short concert by scholars followed after which prizes were distributed.  The prize list is printed.
