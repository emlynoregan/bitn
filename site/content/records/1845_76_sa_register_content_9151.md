The Smelting Company, known as the English & Australian Smelting Co., began operations in the colony in 1849 and to the end of 1854 had smelted 7,597 tons of fine copper, the average value of which can be taken at £95 per ton.  The present price is £120.  During the same period it has shipped 21,000 tons of ore and consumed 27,000 tons of coal.  In the six months commencing October 1851 the amount of cartage between Burra and Port Wakefield was about 10,000 tons each way.  (About 10,300 tons of coal up and 9,600 tons of ore down.)  During the season which may now be considered at an end the quantity has been about 3,000 tons each way.  The 70 miles of the Port Wakefield Road have been kept in repair at the Smelting Company’s expense, with but a solitary grant of £500 from the Central Road Board.  The total traffic which has passed over it during the last five years has been 48,730 tons or an average of more than 9,700 tons per annum.
