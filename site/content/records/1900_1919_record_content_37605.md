Mr Truscott said the Kooringa and Light Horse teams should be combined and then with Aberdeen, Hallett, Farrell’s Flat and Terowie there would be a good association.  The Corporation charged ⅓ of the gate, but the Aberdeen oval cost £2-2-0 for the season, so all matches would be played there which was unfair.  Council will be asked for a season price.  Last year Victoria Park had cost them £14-18-2.  Mr Crewes promised to do what he could in Council to foster cheap clean healthy sport.
