Thefts

1.  Between 17 October and 24 October copper wire to the value of c. $2,600 was stolen near Burra.  It was taken from the railway line alongside the Barrier Highway south of Burra.  About three kilometres of wire was stolen.  (The railways are removing the telephone line that runs beside the line.)  Similar thefts have occurred near Riverton.

2.  Another vehicle was milked of petrol on the night of 25/26 October when about 60 litres was stolen from a vehicle in Thames Street.
