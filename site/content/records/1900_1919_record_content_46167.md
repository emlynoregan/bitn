Burra Town Council.

A letter will be sent to the SAR telling them that in the event of an accident they would be held responsible for the misplaced fence.  Several near accidents have occurred.

The offer from R.M. McBride to sell blocks 8 & 9 in Graham for £30 is rejected.  The offer of another block from Roach & Son for £100 was also rejected.

Cr McBride said his firm would be happy for them to open a quarry on the mine property for a royalty.  The inspector reported good quality metal there.  Offer accepted.

The premises opposite the Institute are to be moved further along (away from the new bridge) and painted.  [Presumably this refers to a toilet block.]

The Town Clerk read a letter from November 1913, which contained the adopted minute re Hon. John Lewis and the Burra Creek lease.

‘The Council should reserve certain parts of the creek as they may require for planting, which should be marked on the plan and then granted your firm (Bagot, Shakes & Lewis) a right of way over the creek, excepting the reserves, in perpetuity at a nominal rent.’
