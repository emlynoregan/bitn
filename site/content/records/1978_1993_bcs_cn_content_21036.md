The Burra Youth Centre will reopen on 3 August with a video night after several years of inactivity.  [The Youth Group (as it was then termed) was mentioned as already existing in the Community News of 9 June 1978.  In September 1978 it is reported in its new clubrooms.  The last reference seems to be in June 1985.]

The rekindling of interest follows a survey done recently by young people and parents through the BCS and the Community Newsletter.  It was organised by Year 12 School to Work to Community Students and their Community Service Teacher Dennis Morgan.  The results showed:

Young people would support a Youth Centre.

The age range would be 10-19, but it would be necessary to have separate activities for juniors 10-14 and seniors 15-19 initially, with perhaps a third split later.

Friday and/or Saturday nights were favoured.

Most popular activities were discos, video nights, competitions and camps.

There seemed to be enough parent/adult support.

A Committee/Planning Group would emerge after the first couple of activities.
