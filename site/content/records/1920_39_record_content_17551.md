A meeting was held in the Booborowie Hall on 11 November to consider the Government proposal to sell off Ayers Forest Reserve for closer settlement.  A number of local speakers favoured the retention of the forest.  They said it was just coming into it productive stage and though not suited for milling, the timber was useful and had good lasting qualities.  The unanimous decision was to send a deputation to ask the Government to preserve the forest.
