New Kooringa Wesleyan Parsonage.

There is over 1 column devoted to this topic.

The old parsonage was crumbling so it was decided to build a new one.  Plans were obtained and a site bought in Kangaroo street.  Tenders were called and subscriptions raised.  On Wednesday 7 June a memorial stone was laid by Mrs John Drew.

The building stands on an allotment 100’ x 100’ which cost £60 and the building is to cost £960.  The architect is W.C. Dauker and F.W. Holder is to superintend.  Sara & Dunstan are the contractors.

The Burra circuit has 7 churches, 2 ministers, 10 local preachers, 46 schoolteachers, 158 members, 430 Sunday school scholars and 1525 attendants on public worship.

Rev. J.G. Wright is the minister of the Primitive Methodist Church and Rev. J. Pearce the minister of the Bible Christian Church.

Tea was taken in the schoolroom after the stone laying, tables being provided by the congregations from Kooringa, Redruth, Baldry, Westbury, Baldina and Mongolata.

Almost 300 were accommodated for tea, after which Dr Brummitt presided at a public meeting.  Mr Holder gave an account of the parsonage movement.  The furnishing etc. would bring the total cost to c. £1,100.  Messrs Drew & Co. had contributed £200 and other subscribers totalled another £400.  A bazaar to raise £200 would be begun at once so the debt would not be great and the old parsonage would bring in some rent.  (c. £16 p.a.)

Mr Charles Drew was welcomed and presented with an address written by J. Dunstan Jun.

Proceeds from the gathering were c. £46.

The house is 68’4” x 41’ with 8 rooms, a passage, a bathroom, and a very large underground tank.
