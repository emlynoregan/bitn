Burra Ridge Pty Ltd has been impressed by very favourable reports on mineralisation in the area and intends to begin a $200,000 exploration project soon.  An office will be established in Burra.  The Directors have appointed Southern Cross Explorations as the Manager Operator of its Special Mining Lease covering 990 square miles around Burra.  Southern Cross has also acquired 50% interest in the private areas the company holds and a right to acquire 50% interest in the mining titles arising from the Special Mining Lease after exploration.  Investigations have found the presence of gold, copper, silver, lead, zinc, vanadium, fluoride, asbestos and phosphate among others.  Some copper samples from Princess Royal area have ranged from 7.5 to 14.5% copper and a drilling program has been prepared for this area.  Authority to enter areas has been arranged and is being arranged for other sites.
