Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial Committee: general meeting at the Burra Institute last Friday.

The mayor, S.M. Lane was in the chair.  Mr Crewes read the report.

On 11 August 1919 Messrs Crewes and Winnall were appointed to meet delegates from the various District Councils to call for designs and prices and make the necessary arrangements and then to report to the General Committee, which they now do.  The executive met on 28 August 1919 when the representatives were: E.W. Crewes (Presiding)

W.G. Hawkes (Apoinga DC)

J.H. Rogers (Hanson DC)

T. McWaters (Burra DC)

W.H. McWaters (World’s End)

G.E. Dane (Secretary)

It was resolved that the form of the memorial would be a monument in market Square.  The base and pedestal were to be of marble or granite, surmounted by a bronze statue of an Australian Infantryman life-size.  Space was to be allowed for the names of the fallen from the Burra Corporation, Burra DC, Hanson DC, Mt Bryan DC, Apoinga DC and Booborowie DC with each district to be kept distinct.  A call would be made for competitive designs to cost not more than £2,000, with a prize of £10 to the selected designer.  12 designs were submitted.  The Executive chose design number two by A.S. Tillett, subject to approval of the General Committee.  The details of this design are:

Granite pedestal, column and cap

Figures of lions and soldier’s statue in bronze or marble

Basement of dressed granite with bronze tablets surmounted by a polished granite column to be capped by a carved capital and there to be four lions and a soldier’s statue.  Height 38 feet.

Solid granite base 9 feet square

The height of the figure to be about 7 feet overall

Four steps of solid granite surrounding the base
