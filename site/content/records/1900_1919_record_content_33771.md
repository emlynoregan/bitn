Booborowie Railway.  A meeting at Booborowie woolshed on Wednesday discussed a petition for a railway from Farrell’s Flat to North Booborowie.  The idea is that it would be a guaranteed line under the District Councils Act 1911.  After considering their liabilities under the Act the meeting moved to go ahead with the petition.
