Burra Mine.  Mr Gilfillan MLC advises that there is an estimated 3 million tons of low grade ore at Burra in the form of copper carbonate impregnated in carbonate rock.  The usual method of extraction by the use of acid would not be economic with this volume of rock and the problem is to find a cheaper recovery method.
