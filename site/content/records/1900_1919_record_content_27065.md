Telephonic Communication

The telephone connection between Adelaide and Burra, promised some time ago is likely to soon be realised.  Kapunda is to be linked to Burra soon and the Adelaide to Kapunda line is being attended to.  The trunk line is now in the neighbourhood of Salisbury on its way to Adelaide.
