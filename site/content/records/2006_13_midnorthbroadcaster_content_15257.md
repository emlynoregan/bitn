Nature Foundation SA is calling for help in locating and protecting the rare and endangered pygmy bluetongue lizard.  Flinders University and NFSA have been conducting research into the lizards’ habitat and the threats to their continuing survival.  The lizards live in the trapdoor spider holes of the Wolf Spider.  They are dormant in winter and active in summer when they eat small insects including locusts.  September’s research is taking place on NFSA’s Teliqua Reserve 10 km northwest of Burra.  100 places are available for those interested in taking part in the Lizard Crawl on 8 September from c. 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.  Cost $25 per adult, $12 concession or $50 for a family (minimum age 10 years).
