Royal Adelaide Show

The Grand Champion Merino Ewe was bred and exhibited by D.R. McInnes & Sons of Hallett.  It was their only exhibit.  The Jubilee Challenge Trophy for Best Five Merino Sheep again went to last year’s winner W.B. Ashby & Sons of ‘Ashrose’ Hallett.  [Other winners are also listed.]
