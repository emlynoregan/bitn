The Council will also establish a Heritage Advisory Sub-Committee to advise and make recommendations to Council on heritage matters in the district.  Crs H. Stockman, J.W. Barton and G. Radford will be Council representatives and Chairman J. Hawker will be an ex-officio member.  The formation of the sub-committee follows increasing development of sites such as Redruth Gaol, Paxton Square Cottages, the mine area and problems with the redevelopment of Market Square.  At the February meeting of Council Cr H. Stockman suggested the District Clerk and District Engineer visit the historic mining town of Maldon in Victoria to report on its heritage and development.  They will visit Maldon in April.
