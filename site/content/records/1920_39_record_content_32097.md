Burra Town Council, 14 October

F. Treloar sought the removal of two large pine trees in front of his property.

Crs Lee & Allen had inspected and agreed they were damaging the property.  Council will inspect.

A special meeting is called to consider the purchase of a motor truck.

Cr Woollacott complained that work approved in north Ward had not been done and with the year near its end the Ward was still £200 in credit.  If the Council could not do the work it was the duty of Council to call tenders.

Cr Allen raised objections that work approved in West Ward 12 months ago was just being done.

Cr Pearce said it was suggested that Main Road work be let to contract, as that was delaying other work, but their own men did a better job – even if Ward repairs had to wait.
