National Trust of SA

At the recent AGM Maureen Wright was presented with an honour Award for her years of service.  She is in her 14th year as Chair of the Burra Burra Branch and has served on many committees, as well as representing the Trust on various external committees.  Under her leadership the Passport system has grown into a major tourist attraction and income generation for the branch.

Burra Swimming Club.  After a successful ‘Come & Try’ afternoon and information session by Des Pfeiffer, President and Coach of Eudunda Amateur Swimming Club, the subcommittee will now meet next Thursday to plan the next step in the formation of a Burra District Swimming Club.

Geraldine Smedley has retired after a teaching career of 40 years.  She began at Naracoorte in 1959 and then went to Bordertown.  She and Ron then headed for Alice Springs, where she joined the Commonwealth Teaching Service for two or three years, before they moved to Burra at the end of 1977.  She then did some studying and part-time teaching.  From 1980 -89 she taught at Mt Bryan before coming to Burra from 1988-99, with one year (1995) with the School of the Air at Pt Augusta.  When she retired from BCS, a garden she and some students began about six years ago was named in her honour.  [Photo.]
