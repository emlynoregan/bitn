Burra Town Council, 17 July

A.E. Marr advised that an electric scheme similar to that proposed for Burra had been installed at Crystal Brook for £4,500 with four miles of mains.  On this basis the Burra Scheme as first proposed would cost £7,500 and main streets only £5,800.  He advised calling tenders.  When Crystal Brook’s scheme was operational Burra and Mt Gambier would be the only large towns in SA without a scheme.

A move by Cr Collins to have tenders called failed through want of a seconder.

Cr Kellaway moved that the Council not entertain any scheme as a Council proposition.  Carried.

Mr Marr is to be notified that Council will not entertain the scheme.

The Immigration Dept. advises that three boys will be coming to the Burra District.

The Burra Corporation will pay £143-10-0 towards the [running] costs of the Burra Hospital.

Advice received from DC Hanson re a meeting at the Burra Institute concerning Burra Burra Hospital rates.

Council resolved to borrow £300 needed to build the Fire Station.

Cr Harris moved that the war trophy guns be placed differently.  They were at present dangerous and traffic was cutting up the material at the base of the memorial.  The Mayor said that a Memorial Committee meeting on Monday would deal with the matter.

A letter of sympathy will be sent to the family of the late Mrs Philip Lane Sen.
