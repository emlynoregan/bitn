SA Mining Association Half-Yearly Report [Editorial]

The report was issued at the meeting on 19 October.  The yield of ore for the last six months has been large and the average price has been good.  The expected profit will be less than in previous years because the extended workings of the mine require expenditure on improvements of a permanent nature.  This should in the near future be balance by increased output.  The deeper workings require the employment of more men, thus increasing the wages bill.  Extra men have had to be employed in repairs, exploring new ground, sinking a new engine shaft and other works of a permanent nature, which though necessary do not yield ore.  There has also been large expenditure on a new and powerful pumping engine.  Though this statement applies to the year ending 30 September 1859, the financial report does not come down to a later date than 30 September 1858.

Comparison of two half-years:

The report for the half-year ending 30 September 1858 showed a balance of £57,435-14-11 applicable to dividends, to which must be added the profits arising from operations of 1859.

In the last six months 6,591 tons of ore were raised; 832 tons less than for the previous six months.  The estimated yield was 22-23%.  743 tons of copper sold in Adelaide realised an average of over £100 per ton.  The general quoted price in London was £107-10-0.  Unsold produce is equal to 1,358 tons of fine copper, which if sold at present rates would produce a profit of £23,531-18-11 to add to the balance from 1858 to make a gross profit of £80,967-13-10.  From this the Directors have set apart a sum of £24,640 for two dividends of 100% (£5 per £5 share) to be paid on 3 December and 3 March next.

The Captain’s reports show continued discoveries of rich ore.

Persons employed by the Association are 1,208 or 83 more than at the last report.
