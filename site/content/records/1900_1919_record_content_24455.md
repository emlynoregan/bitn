Work on the line for the syndicate comprising Charles Warnes, T. Warnes, I.J. Warnes, W.P. Barker, & James Gallagher, has begun.  The distance to the terminus at Quondong is 110 miles and a contract has been let for 60 miles.  The main line will call at Baldina, Woolgangi, Koomooloo, Old Koomooloo, Sturt Vale and Quondong.  The main line will be carried on steel posts and will follow fence lines for protection.  The work from this end is expected to start next week.
