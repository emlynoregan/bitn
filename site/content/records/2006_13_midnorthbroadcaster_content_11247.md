Burra Hospital

Member for Stuart, Dan van Holst Pellekaan, in Parliament asked the Minister for Health when Burra could expect accident and emergency services at Burra Hospital to be provided by a Burra-based doctor.  The Minister said the local doctor had been assessed and found not to have the skills necessary to be credentialed for those services.  She had appealed this decision.  He offered no indication of when that process was likely to be completed and claimed that until it was the whole thing was outside Government control.
