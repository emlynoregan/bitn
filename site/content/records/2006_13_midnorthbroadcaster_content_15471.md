Stephen Holder, a great grandson of Sir Frederick William Holder, and his wife Gale travelled from New Mexico to Australia to meet relatives and visit the town where his ancestor had played such an important role.  Stephen’s grandfather was born in Kooringa in 1882, the third of eight children to Sir Frederick and his wife Julia, nee Stephens.  During their two day visit the couple were treated to a fine dinner at the Burra Town Hall hosted by the Burra History Group and the Town Hall Committee and on Friday morning Stephen unveiled the recently erected plaque in Holder Garden on Chapel Street. Burra History Group president Meredith Satchell co-ordinated the visit and said that F.W. Holder was an unsung hero of the town.  She could think of no other Burra resident who was so involved with community activities and who rose to such important positions in SA and Federal Governments.  He was born in Happy Valley SA 1850 and died in Melbourne in 1909.  In 1875 he came to Burra as a teacher and subsequently was a shopkeeper and manager, owner and editor of the Burra Record from 1880-90.  He was also an architect, JP and coroner.  While in Burra he was a local preacher, and took a prominent part in the Burra Parliamentary Club, Burra Young Men’s United Association, the Rifle Club, Burra Floricultural Society and the Burra School Board of Advice.  He instigated the Burra Volunteer Rifle Company and at one time was chairman of the Burra Institute Committee, Burra Mutual Improvement Association, IOR Friendly Society, the Temperance Movement in Burra and the Redruth Band of Hope.  He also acted as Curator of the Cemetery, Secretary of the Local Board of Health and Town Clerk.  He found time to be Secretary or Treasurer of the Chinese Famine Relief Committee and the Burra Show Committee and was later Patron of the Cricket and Football Clubs.  He was Mayor in 1887 & 1889 and in 1887 was elected to the SA House of Assembly for the District of Burra.  He left Burra in 1891, but continued as its MP until transferring to the Federal Parliament in 1901.  He was SA Premier in 1892 and 1899-1901 and also served as the Treasurer.  He was elected Speaker of the first Commonwealth Parliament in 1901 and held that office till his death.
