North Booborowie Agricultural Farm has struck trouble with the boys.  Four struck last week.  One was dismissed for insubordination, which caused the strike.  Attendance at Sunday service was voluntary: two did so and the others stayed outside and created a nuisance by playing mouth organs and other instruments.
