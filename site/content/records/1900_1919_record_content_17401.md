‘They Say’

Rev. James the hypocritical parson who fled Perth recently took with him on his journey from Melbourne a servant Annie Kindred aged 25 or 26.

The person or persons who poured kerosene on the rear part of that faithful animal and set alight to it ought to be tar and feathered. [sic]  [See further at the court case, next issue page 4.]

The Mayor deserves a pat on the back for supplying 25 prizes for juveniles on Empire Day.
