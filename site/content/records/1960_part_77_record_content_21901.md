Burra & District War Memorial Committee held its AGM.  President D. Halliday reported that had raised £940 over several months to provide for a new toilet block and the grassing of the oval.  £231 was left over and transferred to the account to provide reticulation services.  A bore was sunk 180 ft by Mr Thomas for a cost of £200.  The flow was less than hoped for, but advice is being sought and quotes obtained for reticulation.  Elected: President, D.A. Halliday; Vice-President, P.W. Holness; Secretary, A.C. Heinrich and Treasurer, T.G .Perry.
