The Education Question by R.W.M. part 2.

Supposing a workingman’s son does manage to get a superior education and so get to be a clerk in some Government office or win an exhibition to the university.  How does he prosper - he will have to contend with those who are better nourished, have influential parents and have a social position giving advantages he cannot match.  Too late he will find the lot of the tradesman he affected to despise is infinitely preferable.

How far then is the Government justified in raising educational standards, knowing full well the disappointments in store for the many?  Examinations are not the true test of all round superiority.  ‘The mean man is more easily exalted, and the man of honourable instincts and hereditary integrity, finds himself distanced by unscrupulous but clever men.’

‘Our public service is becoming tainted with this spirit.’

R.W.M. goes on to be concerned that the professions as well as Government service will be swamped by men who will not be influenced by considerations of honourable conduct and professional tradition if we allow only education and academic merit to dictate who is admitted.  If the Government could educate the masses and give them good jobs it would still be absurd to pay them ‘wealth equal to that of the more opulent classes because they would lack the refinement and dignity of character the outcome of a life of ease and intellectual culture.’

The dangers of ‘gratuitous State education’ are palpable.  The years of compulsion should stop at 11 as those who can afford to pay are taking advantage of the present system to age 13.  After 11 full cost recovery fees are needed.  Only the most exceptionally talented children should be encouraged with state aid beyond 11.

[To be continued]  [All in all a very conservative document.]
