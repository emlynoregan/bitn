‘Observer’ seeks to know who is in charge of Ridgway Park as the open gate allows cattle and horses to enter and break down trees.  If Mr Ridgway has no interest the Council should resume control.

The editor says Mr Ridgway has charge as there is an agreement from 4 May 1885 whereby he takes control for seven years at £5 p.a. to be spent on plantings and other improvements.  Water to be laid on by the Council and charged as for other reserves.
