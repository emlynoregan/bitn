Kooringa News, 6 may

On Monday a public meeting was held in the Wesleyan Chapel for the purpose of raising funds for the Aboriginal Friends’ Society.  Mr MacDermott took the chair and Rev. J. Hancock moved a resolution that the meeting acknowledged its Christian duty to support the welfare of the Aborigines.  He gave an address in support and the motion was seconded by W.H. Wilkinson.  The latter observed that despite denials by some persons ‘he thought it had been proved beyond doubt that the poor natives really had souls, and more, that they were susceptible of religious impressions.’  The motion was carried.

Rev. H. Cole then moved a motion applauding the success of the Society, thanking God for His aid therein and proposing a local branch be formed.  In speaking in support he recounted his experiences at Strathalbyn and Point McLeay.  Rev. D.J.H. Ibbetson seconded the motion in an interesting, forcible and somewhat lengthy speech.  He said the Secretary of the Society would have accompanied him had not circumstances prevented it.  He outlined the work of the Society.  The motion was carried and a collection yielded £9.  The local branch was then formed and a committee established.

The road-making continues apace, but there are a number of objections arising as well.  The main complaint is that the bridge will be admirably suited for blocking the flow of water that rushes down the creek after heavy rain and a well-constructed ford would have served the road needs adequately and allowed the stream a freer course.  The road is but 18 feet wide and there is a high bank on one side and a yawning morass on the other.  Picture what will happen when a dozen mule wagons or bullock drays are dragging their mass down the centre of this and they meet other would be users of the street.  Then again instead of going close to the Bank, Institute or Telegraph-Office, where little excavation would have been needed, the road goes along the side of the hill, necessitating much quarrying and blasting.

The sheep farmers are much in want of rain and if it does not come soon the lambing season will be an unprofitable one.
