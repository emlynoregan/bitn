The Koonoona cropping program resulted in 126 tonnes of barley.  In January Colin Baker (the first Secretary) was transferred from the town.  He was deeply involved in setting up the Sports Club and his work over many years is acknowledged.  A new netball court was laid in March at a cost of $9,000.  The remaining court was renovated for $2,800.  A grant of $1,000 from the Local Government Assistance Fund will go towards terracing in front of the complex.  The Ladies Auxiliary continues to be the success story of the club and was busy with ten major catering functions and the Council teas.  The Redbanks sheep project continues to bring in a modest income in what turned out to be a very dry season in that area.  The garbo boys continue to do a fantastic job.
