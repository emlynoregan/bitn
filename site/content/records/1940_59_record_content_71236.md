Fire.  A fire occurred on Saturday afternoon in the back portion of 27 Paxton Square.  The house is occupied by Mr H.R. Nourse and family.  His daughter, Laura, had lit a fire under the copper in the laundry and while she briefly left it, a stick fell onto the floor and ignited the uprights of the wall.  Mr Norm. Pens Sen. and the occupier had the fire semi-controlled when the brigade arrived and some charring of the back wall and of the beams in the roof was the only damage.
