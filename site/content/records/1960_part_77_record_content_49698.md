Redruth Methodist Church

The service to be held at Redruth Methodist Church on Sunday at 11 a.m. will be the last regular service there.  It will be conducted by Rev. A.R. Medson, State Secretary of the Methodist Church.  It will end almost 118 years of Methodist services at Redruth.  Services will now be centralised at the Burra [Kooringa] Methodist Church.  The trustees of the church will meet on Wednesday to consider the future use of the property when the District Chairman the Rev. D.V.G. Mack from Riverton will preside.
