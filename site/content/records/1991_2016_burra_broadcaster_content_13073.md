SA Tourism is enjoying high bed occupancy rates, but local responses are mixed.  Country SA recorded a 3% increase in the last quarter.  Barry Wright of Tiverâ€™s Row Cottages said they had 47.2% occupancy in December 1966 quarter, up 5% on 1995, but summer occupancies are the downfall.  Paxton Square income for 1996-97 is expected to fall by 20% from the previous year.
