Deceased was born 19 June 1831 at Zwittan in Moravia.  He was educated at a Jesuit Gymnasium at Mariaschein in Bohemia and in 1856 entered the Noviciate of the Society of Jesus at Baumgartenburg in Austria.  He studied philosophy at Pressburg in Hungary and later at Innsbruck in Tyrol where he was ordained a priest on 29 March 1863.  On 3 December 1869 he, with Rev. Father Rogalski SJ and Br Waldmann SJ, went to England, embarking at Liverpool on 20 December for Melbourne.  They arrived on 23 March 1870 and reached Seven Hills on 5 April 1870.

He taught at the College as well as attending a variety of the Jesuit mission stations in SA.  His efforts raising funds saw the start of the building of St Joseph’s at Kooringa on 11 May 1873 when the foundation stone was laid by the Very Rev. C.A. Reynolds, Administrator of the Diocese of Adelaide.  The church was opened on 8 November 1874 by the Rt. Rev. C.A. Reynolds, then the Bishop of Adelaide.  The old chapel, as the Catholics called their former place of worship on Commercial St, was then devoted to school purposes.  A few small rooms at the back housed the Sisters of St Joseph for the many years they taught there.

Fr Kreissl like progress and began the fine new school and convent behind the Church on the hill.  The new buildings were blessed by Rt Rev. Dr Reynolds on 19 March 1882.  The old chapel then passed into the hands of John Lewis.

In collecting money for these buildings Father Kreissl travelled far, going to the Barrier Ranges for example.  Around Burra he was tireless, working at bazaars and art unions as well as at pastoral care.

On 12 March 1884 he left Manoora where he had resided while attending the Burra Mission and took up residence in Jamestown, which along with Caltowie was in his charge up to his last illness.  In 1885 he began the new Church of St Kilian, which was opened by the Rt Rev. Dr Reynolds on 22 March 1886.  While pastor of Kooringa he was given a buggy and harness and when leaving for Jamestown a purse of sovereigns which he donated to St Joseph’s.  His last mass at Jamestown was on 29 July 1888 and in poor health he left on 15 August, passing through Kooringa on his way to Seven Hills where he died on 29 August.  On 5 September a Solemn Requiem Mass for him was celebrated at St Joseph’s, Kooringa.
