Re-roofing in Burra

Light weight metal tiles do not blend well with the heritage of Burra.  Alternatives are available and in most cases are cheaper.  Galvanised iron and ‘Colourbond’ are two alternatives that should be explored.  Approval from Council in writing is needed for reproofing and residents should not sign contracts or pay money before obtaining Planning Approval from Council.
