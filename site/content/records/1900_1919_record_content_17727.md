A Motor Trip.  On Saturday afternoon a number of motor cycles and three motor cars left the Kooringa Garage for Morgan and Koomooloo.  After a pleasant run they reached these places.  Excitements occurred on the return run which will be reported next issue.  Though they got lost in a dust storm and had other misadventures they all voted the trip ‘a real “boshter”’.  Mr Harold Pearse was lost and has not been heard of since, though it is believed he eventually got home to The Gums all right.
