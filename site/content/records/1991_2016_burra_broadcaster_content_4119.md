Terowie Uniting Church

With the closure of the church the Citizens’ Association has been speaking with the Peterborough Parish Council to reach an agreement for the Association to obtain title to the property.  The aim was to keep it as a heritage building and prevent it from being developed as a residence or commercial property.  Though sympathetic, the Council needs to obtain what it can when the building is sold and therefore will soon put it up for tender.  Originally the Wesleyan Church, work commenced on the building in 1882 and opening services were held on 2 March 1883.  The final service was on 19 December 1993.  An interesting history of the church and Sunday school is given in the May issue of Terowie Enterprise.
