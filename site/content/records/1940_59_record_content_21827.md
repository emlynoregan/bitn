Empire Day was celebrated at Burra Schools on Friday.  In the past this meant large number of parents and friends visited the school and listened the the pupils singing patriotic songs and watched them Saluting the Flag.  One or two leading citizens would deliver speeches that were either short and to the point or sometimes long and boring.  A half-holiday was declared, but students were duty bound to attend school sports in the afternoon, whether as competitors or spectators.  Now it amounts to a broadcast over the wireless and a half-holiday.
