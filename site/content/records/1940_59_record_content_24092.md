Mrs A.L. Kellock hit off the first ball for the croquet season.  It has been customary for two of the ladies to throw up the first kitty and bowl the first ball, but this year the only two remaining foundation members still playing were asked to do so.  Mr E.F. Marston threw the first kitty and Mr C.D. Wilkinson bowled the first ball.
