Trust Homes in Burra

Six homes are to be erected, with three of them nearly completed.  We understand that six more are going to be erected near the railway station in Burra North.  The homes are frame houses with asbestos sheets.  The most modern conveniences are being installed.  BUT:

Why is Burra being inflicted with such hastily built buildings, while other towns are graced with brick structures?

Are these going to be reasonably sound investments for purchasers.

Even though Burra is far from brick kilns, there is plenty of dressed stone around and some good stone masons about.

The second question is doubtful.  We believe that the price will be £2,000 or better and that a £400 deposit will be required, with interest and capital paid off over 20 years.  The weekly repayment will be 30/- (£1-10-0) plus rates, taxes and repair bills.  The timber used is green and light and may not have a good life of much more than 15 years.

30/- a week plus rates and taxes amounts to about £1,180 over 15 years. To this add the £400 deposit and the weekly rental bill amounts to £2-4-0.  If the residents walks out of his tumble-down shack after 15 years, the Housing Trust will be left lamenting for £420 of the £2,000 first mentioned.

We don’t call that a good idea and investment.
