Obituary.  W.V. Ford of Mile End writes a tribute to the late Mr William (Bill) Kellaway of Copperhouse, who spent his last years in Adelaide and died on 28 July.  For many years he played football for Aberdeen and did not retire from the game until about his fifties.  He continued to take an interest in the welfare of the Aberdeen Club and will always be remembered for his cheerful acceptance of whatever came along.

[Born 1 September 1882 Kooringa: died 28 July 1966 Hyde Park.]
