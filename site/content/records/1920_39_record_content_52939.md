Mongolata

Salvation Army Captain Stacey & Mrs Stacey visited Mongolata on Thursday and held a children’s service in the afternoon and an evening service in the Boarding House.

Mongolata Tennis Club held another tournament on Wednesday last in which the final was won by H. Fisher who defeated Miss J. Carpenter 31-25.

Burra Rifle Club shot the 5th stage of the Baldina Trophy in very boisterous conditions.  Best scores were by E.C. Collins, J.A. Riggs and R. Pexton.  A.C. Aughey and A.B. Riggs scored possible at 200 yards and E.C. Collins one at 500 yards.

Leighton Cricket Club held its annual meeting on Saturday 15 September.  Elected were Patron, I.J. Warnes; President, M. Jacka and Secretary, M. Williams.  The club will play in the Leighton District Association with Andrews, Hilltown, Borinia & Farrell’s Flat.

Burra Cycling & Athletic Club held a dance in the Oddfellows Hall, Aberdeen on Saturday last and raised £11.  The club was formed when Mr Alick Bevan convened a meeting following the success of the Anzac Sports that resolved to try to maintain interest in cycling and athletic competition.  In the evening trophies were presented.  Mr S. Kellaway before making the presentations said the membership was 80 with 28 riding members.  17 track and road cycling races had been run and the interest was greater than when they started.  [Though the athletic side seems to have faded out.]

Highest points have been scored by Rex Opperman of Redruth, a lad aged 18, but interested in cycling from a small child.  Leo Taylor won the cup for the 25-mile handicap event in which T. Pohlner of Hallett won the sash for fastest time.  Clem Wilson of Kooringa was the runner-up in both over-all points and in the 25-mile race.

Football.  The Kooringa Club’s final meeting for the season was held and T. Kellaway and Dick Halliday tied for most useful man.  The club was financially sound.
