Editorial.  Inaugural

It has often been a matter of surprise that a local paper has never been started in Burra.  In the palmy days of the Mine from 1846 to 1852 the population was large and thriving, but of a different class from that now included in the district.  At the time there were no provincial papers in SA and not more than three papers in Adelaide.  But times have changed greatly and several important towns in the colony have had one or even two newspapers for years.  It is difficult to explain why Burra has lagged behind ‘but even if there has hitherto been any serious impediment to the starting of a local paper, we venture to think that the important changes which, during the past three years, have taken place in the district, have removed any such impediment, and that the time has arrived for establishing a journalistic organ of our own.’

We think that a town with its own Council ought to support a newspaper.  Indeed a respectably conducted newspaper ought to add as much to the status of a town as a Council does.  Our intention is not to trumpet Burra’s fame to the world.  In fact the most brilliant period of Burra’s history is a thing of the past, but there are today indications of steady improvement, giving hopes of a brighter future than seemed possible a few years ago.

The prospects of the Mine again proving very profitable are encouraging, but Burra is no longer entirely dependent on the Mine for its prosperity.  Important as the Mine is, the extension of agricultural settlement in the surrounding districts is a great source of prosperity.  Burra is the focus of a great are of wheat and wool growing country to the north, west and east.  These lands are becoming more densely settled every year and Burra’s importance as the central town of such a large district will become greater.

With a greater population the need for a local paper increases.  Local wants require more persistent advocacy than we can expect to get from the impartial journals of the metropolis.  Local grievances need airing and local resources and institutions need to be kept before the public.  We hope that local tradesmen and manufacturers will see the advantage of advertising their businesses.

In politics we will be liberal, always taking the side of progress, seeking to promote the prosperity of the Colony in general and of the Burra District in particular.  While exposing abuses we will seek to avoid scurrility.  Our columns will be open for the free exchange of views on matters of public interest.  We shall be glad to receive concise well-written letters of news from the Northern Areas and also such other literary assistance as our friends may be able and willing to supply.  We trust that in a few months our paper will come to be regarded as a necessity.
