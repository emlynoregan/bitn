Burra hospital.  The Chairman of the Board, Mr S.J. Woollacott, writes outlining the Board’s determination to reduce the overdraft.  Firstly by actively pursuing debtors according to the law [which is printed in the paper] and secondly by making a wool drive – asking each sheep owner in the district for one fleece or a bal of locks, stains and crutchings, or the equivalent in money.
