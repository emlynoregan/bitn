Aberdeen Football Dinner

Mr R.M. Reed said that this year two things had stood out:

1.  The amalgamation of the A1 and A2 teams.

2.  The match versus North Eastern.

The Aberdeen Colts had done well.

The Aberdeen Club has meant that there are now six teams in the town whereas six years ago there were only two and it was hard for a lad to get a game.

Mr B.L. Hirschausen said the clubâ€™s defeats were due to a lack of training.  This should improve next year when the club hopes to erect lights on the oval and so have one big training night per week.
