‘Burra Record’ Microfilm Project

At a ceremony last week 44 rolls of microfilm covering 102 years of the ‘Burra Record’ were handed over to the care of the Burra Library.

The presentation was made by Mr Jim Crawford of the Public Libraries Board in the State Library in Adelaide on 10 December.

It is the aim of the State Librarian to have all SA Country Newspapers on microfilm and the Clare ‘Northern Argus’ will be their next project.

Mr Tony Barker as Chairman of the Library Board of Management accepted the films.  Others to speak were Mrs Fern – formerly Barbara Bagg of Burra who along with Ian Auhl was one of the chief proponents of the idea.  [Photo of the handover.]
