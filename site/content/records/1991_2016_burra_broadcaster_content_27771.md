Farrell Flat Airport

Efforts are being made to upgrade Farrell Flat Airport with lighting and an extended sealed runway to serve the Clare Valley, Gilbert Valley and the Burra Region.  Local supporter Adrian Smith of Farrell Flat Ashmore Engineering met with Rob Kerin MP to explain the advantages.  The proposal involves an extension of the runway from 560 m to 1,400 m.  The extension would take it from the Clare & Gilbert Valley Council area into the Regional Council of Goyder’s area.  Both Councils have given in principle support.  The nearest airfields are Whitwarta, west of Balaklava; Gawler, 64 nautical miles south and Jamestown to the north.  The upgrade would benefit flying schools and agricultural operators and could help break into the overseas air tourist market.

The Farrell Flat-Mintaro Road has recently been sealed.  The opening of the improvement to what had been a horror stretch of road was celebrated by the Mintaro School students riding their bicycles from Mintaro to Farrell Flat Airport hangar for what was promoted as the longest morning tea.

Adchem has shipped out its first load of basic cupric carbonate, better known as malachite.  This first load of 20 tonnes is going to Osmose in Memphis, Tennessee, USA.  Production could grow to around 5,000 tons of carbonate annually within twelve months, which would represent 20% of the plant’s business, said operations manager Simon Kibble.
