The Food for Britain Appeal has moved on to Â£78-17-1.

Queen of Air Force Dance was held on Saturday evening in the RSL Rooms.  This resulted in the penny votes for the Queens being currently:

Miss Audrey Bown, Miss Navy, 3.600

Miss Mary Field, Miss Air Force 3,600

Miss Barbara Jennison, Miss Army, 600

Unfortunately there will not be time for a Miss Army Dance and we hope supporters will rally round Miss Army in the progressive penny vote totals.
