Foxes.  [There are widespread reports over much of the year about people sighting foxes all over the mid-north.  They were a new phenomenon and although isolated reports had been coming in for several years many people had yet to see one and they were still only around in very low numbers.  The first reports of foxes locally date from 1901.]
