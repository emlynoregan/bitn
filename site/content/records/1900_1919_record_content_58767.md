Scout Hall.

On Saturday 1 February the Boys Recreation Hall was opened by the Mayor, Mr Crewes.  The day was extremely hot.  The Cheer-up Ladies’ band attended.  Scoutmaster Rigney described how when the troop was formed some three years ago they had met at the old White Hart Hotel, but this unfortunately burnt down.  They had then accepted Mr E.C. Sedgman’s offer of a room at the Waterworks Department for the next two years and now through the generosity particularly of Messrs James Reed & I.J. Warnes they had their own room.

Mr Crewes in opening the building said it had cost £395.  They had £200 of that and hoped before the day was ended to have raised the other £195.

After the opening a bazaar had been organised with stalls on either side of the room.  Mrs I.J. Warnes declared this open and together with the promenade concert in the evening £46 was raised.
