Burra High School Reunion

Adelaide entrepreneur Bob Lott attended and was often asked about his violin playing, which apparently started after a visit to Burra by the Adelaide symphony Orchestra.  He was also asked about stories concerning his father, Cliff Lott who will be remembered by some for his huge Guy Fawkes bonfires near the school.  And for his sneezes in Market Square â€“ evidently an embarrassment to Bob.
