Ian Auhl & R.M. Farrow, headmasters of the Primary & High schools respectively, wrote to make a general appeal for funds to upgrade the two schools’ libraries.  The Education Department has just made available a room and furnishings for a library for the Primary School in addition to the High School Library.  Approximately £1,000 is needed to adequately stock the two libraries – to be made up of 75% reference and 25% fiction.  Donations would be subsidised pound for pound.
