Snow in Burra.

Last Sunday [28 July] ‘we witnessed the heavist [sic] fall of snow seen in South Australia.’

On Saturday afternoon light flakes fell and more in larger form towards evening, but they melted before they could be examined and about 10 p.m. the fall grew heavier and the ground covered.  Despite the late hour snowballs were soon made and snowballing indulged in for a couple of hours.  On Sunday morning the whole landscape was clad in whiteness some two or three inches thick: ‘scores essayed the task of climbing to the hill tops, and their presence could be seen from a much greater distance than on ordinary occasions.’

‘Every man, woman and child could be seen either snowballing or participating in the fun provided by others.’

At one time fully fifty persons were engaged in Market Square.  In Redruth near the reserve Messrs Lowe, Goodwin and company produced a ball about 10’ in diameter and some 15’ high.  Alongside some buildings drifts 3’ deep accumulated.  Snow continued to fall at intervals – the largest flakes about midday, but from then on the ‘great and glorious sight’ commenced to fade away.  Some snowballs remained till rain on Monday afternoon.  The fall was widespread and the creek was flowing strongly on Saturday night.  The shade temperature on Sunday was 34-40°F.

[There is another ½ column review of the snowfall by the Rev. W.F. James, but it adds little to the preceding.]
