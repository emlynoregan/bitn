A Trip Through the Northern Areas

[The writer describes the journey from Pt Pirie to Georgetown in a spring-cart as being extremely uncomfortable; ‘one is reminded of a tightly packed slave boat in a very heavy sea’.]

It is a pity that more attention is not being paid to roads in the area.  They are virtually impassable to ordinary teams.  [He then goes on to specify particularly bad spots along the roads.]

‘Fancy the whole of the country between Bungaree and Port Pirie in the hands of two sheepfarmers; about three years’ possession would make a modest man rich.  Now there are hundreds of homesteads – such as they are – thousands of hands profitably employed, and scenes of bustling life and activity where but yesterday, comparatively speaking,  the silence was only broken by the solitary shepherd’s call to his dog or the bleating of sheep among the luscious pastures.’

‘The great drawback to the present state of affairs seems to me to be the fact that nearly all the new settlers in the area are not new settlers in the country;  they are merely families who have left holdings which they have exhausted in the older districts, and not as one could wish they were, new comers from home.’

[He then goes on to speculate about what this could mean for the old areas in the future and indeed for the new areas as they in turn become exhausted.]

The absence of good timber for fencing etc. in the area is a drawback.  Despite the poor appearance of housing, the settlers must be more affluent than they appear because a party of travelling photographers told me they had taken £60 in ten days and another photographer reported taking over £100 in less than a month.

On the Pt Pirie side of Narridy the crops are magnificent.  Narridy township has a large and comfortable hotel, built of stone, a blacksmith’s and a good-sized mill, but the town does not seem to be growing very fast.  From there to Georgetown the land was well cultivated and full of wheat.  [He then enters into another discussion of the poor roads and the need for improvements.]

Georgetown is a thriving place with a lot of new building.  There may be 150 houses, some very pretentious stores, a Catholic Chapel and a Baptist Church in the course of erection.  It is, however, almost the muddiest place in the world.

[The author then describes his return to Clare by coach; a difficult and uncomfortable journey over execrable roads in heavy rain, involving walking uphill in pouring rain.]

[Continued 1 October.]
