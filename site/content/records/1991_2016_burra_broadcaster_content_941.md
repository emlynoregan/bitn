Burra Burra DC has received the go-ahead for a number of projects following approval under the Local Capital Works Program announced last week by its Chairman and the Federal Minister for Local Government, David Simmons.  The projects will cost $88,000 of which $63,667 will come from the Commonwealth program and will be concluded in six months.  The projects include upgrading of the Burra Town Hall, re-roofing the Booborowie Hall, public amenities at Mt Bryan and improved drainage for Farrell Flat.  Council chairman Graham Kellock said the projects had been on the agenda for many months, but needed financial assistance.  They will provide some local employment as well as injecting money into the economy.
