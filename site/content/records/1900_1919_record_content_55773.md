Burra Cheer-up Soc.: The Ladies’ band Trip to Pt Pirie

The Band, along with Mr J. Bentley, E.W. Crewes & E.J. Harris, took the Broken Hill Express on Friday 7 June [to Peterborough] and thence to Pt Pirie, a journey of 9 hours, arriving at 6 a.m. on Saturday 8th.  They were met by Mr G. Bull of the Adelaide YMCA and local YMCA representatives.  They were taken to their billets and at 11 a.m. assembled in front of the Town Hall where a platform had been erected.  They were welcomed by the Mayor, J. Forgan, and Mr Crewes responded.

The Band played selections and then paraded the streets playing selections.  In groups of six they were given dinner at various hotels.  At 2.30 they returned to the platform and stirring appeals were made by Mr G. Bull & Mr Crewes interspersed with selections by the Band.  They collected £67 in small money.  At 3.30 p.m. they had afternoon tea at the Barrier Hotel, after which it was back to work till 5 p.m.  Later they reassembled at 7.30 p.m. for further work till 9.30 p.m. when they retired to their billets.

On Sunday they were conducted over the smelter and refinery.  Their hosts took several girls out to places of interest in the afternoon.  Following evening church they performed a sacred concert at the Alhambra Theatre, where the collection was £25.
