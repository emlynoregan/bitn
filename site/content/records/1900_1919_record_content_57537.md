Burra

Celebrations continued on Thursday afternoon when the united bands turned out and speeches were made and a good time had generally.  Mr E. Cock hoped rumours of the Crown Prince’s death were true and the Kaiser with him.

Rev. D.B. Bridgwood was heartily tired of hearing ministers speak, but went on to give an address praising the allies for their honourable conduct in the war, compared with German atrocities.

Captain Trigg spoke also of the joy of victory, but scarcely knew whether to rejoice at rumour of the Crown Prince’s death as death was too good for him.

Sgt Harvey Sweeney, a visitor from Victoria, spoke of the ongoing need for support that returning men would need.  In the evening there was a concert in the open air and among contributors were returned men Sgt Swanson, Cpl Burgess & Driver Darmody.
