Burra Citizen of the Year is Meredith Satchell.

Since returning to her home town seven years ago, Meredith Satchell has worked tirelessly to promote the town by uncovering the pieces of its history.  She is part of The Burra History Group and one of the Burra Town Hall Committee.  Many people have ancestors who spent time in Burra and much of her work is concerned with helping those researching their family history.  The History Group has established a display of historic photographs in the Town Hall and keeping it open every day acts as great publicity both for the town and the hall as a community facility available for hire.  Ms Satchell’s paternal great-grandfather settled in the farming district here in the 1870s.  Ms Satchell said the honour of Burra Citizen of the Year was very humbling given the number of people who volunteer their time in so many ways and she saw it more as a way of promoting Burra’s history.  She will continue to help people researching their families and also will continue to add to the town’s collection of historic photographs.  [Photo]
