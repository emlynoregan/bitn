Anzac Day at Burra was observed with a good crowd at the dawn service.  Mild weather and calm conditions helped boost numbers and many visitors also attended.  Rev. Michael Hillier conducted the service and the Burra Sing Australia Choir led the singing of the hymns and the National Anthem.  Burra RSL President John Trigg read the Ode.  After the service hot drinks and Anzac biscuits were served in the RSL room.
