Obituary.  Henry Pinch died on 7 April, after a short illness, aged 86.  He was a native of Cornwall and came to Australia in 1849 on the Duke of Bedford.  He became engaged to Miss Frances Hicks on the way out and they were married on arrival in Burra in the old Church of England on Limestone Hill by Rev. J.C. Bagshaw.  He brought the first team of horses to Burra for the Patent Copper Co. and worked on the Mine for 20 years.   For a time they lived in one of the historic dugouts until he built a brick house in Redruth.  In his spare time he put the roof on.  Due to high transport costs he carried all the timber from Kooringa on his back.  He sold his creek residence for £3 shortly before the flood that washed out all those huts.  Mr Pinch’s was the first house in Redruth.  Later he bought a farm of 704 acres and held it for 18 years before selling it to Mr J. Cockrum; though later still he re-bought it and handed it to his son-in-law.  He then retired to Redruth.  He was much involved in public life.  He was a District Councillor for three years and Chairman of it for some of that time.  He was a Town Councillor for two years.  He was also for a time a Member of the Burra Hospital Board and a member of the MUIOOF Lodge for 65 years, twice being NG.  He was also a Freemason and was Master of that Lodge in 1886.  Mrs Pinch died in 1912 aged over 90.  The couple had celebrated their Diamond Wedding in 1909.  There were two children: Mrs E.N. Finch & Mrs Josiah Thomas.
