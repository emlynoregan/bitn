There was considerable discussion about a post and drain in Drew Lane and whose responsibility it was and who would be responsible for public liability and whether Drew Lane was a private or Council road.

The Town Clerk was directed to ascertain Councilâ€™s responsibilities and liabilities.

Cr Radford moved an electric light be placed in the new telephone box in Aberdeen.  Carried.

A letter of condolence will be sent to Mrs McBride.
