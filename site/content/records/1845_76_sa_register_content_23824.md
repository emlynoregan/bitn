Farrell’s Flat.  The harvest is coming in.  Messrs Box & Hudson of Kooringa have just completed a handsome and roomy store 66 ft x 33 ft in limestone with Kapunda stone dressings.  This will provide a much needed market for wheat and a source of supply for general goods.  Mr Bleechmore of Mintaro is just completing a neat public house in limestone with Auburn bluestone dressings.  Stormy weather has retarded reaping, but the yield should still be about 20 bushels per acre.

Inconvenience is occasioned by the naming of the railway station Farrell’s Flat and the town Hanson.  Surely one name would have been sufficient.
