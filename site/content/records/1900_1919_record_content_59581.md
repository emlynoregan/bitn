Burra Hospital Board Welcome for Returned Nurses.

On Wednesday afternoon the Board welcomed Sisters Wood & Mosey and Nurses Hatherly and McWaters.

Sister Mosey had been a past Matron who left to extend her knowledge.  After studying in Sydney she had been appointed examiner for the ATN Assoc. in Tasmania.  She had served in France where she won the Royal Red Cross Medal and was in charge of the operating theatre of the No. 1 Australian Hospital, Harefield, England.

Sister Wood was the Matron at the outbreak of the war and at once offered herself and was sent to Egypt and transport service to Gallipoli.  Nurses Hatherly and McWaters had started at Burra as probationers and gained their certificates here.

Mr Winnall gave the welcoming address, followed by Mr McLaren, Rev. Bridgwood, I.J. Warnes, Rev. H.H. Hopton & Mr Crewes.  The speeches were interspersed with items of entertainment.
