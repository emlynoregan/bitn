On Friday Mr Burton & his Equestrian Troupe entered the township from Clare, and though it was 6 p.m. when the drays arrived with the tent, all was ready for a show at 8 p.m. before a crowded audience.  A repetition on Saturday took place before the largest audience seen in Burra and was highly applauded.
