Rev. J.A.S. Williams writes a letter re the old Primitive Methodist Church in Redruth: now the Jubilee Hall.  He recalls the evangelistic fervour of the late Rev. W. Jenkin and the Revs Father Wright, J.J. Salmon, A.J. Birt, S. Gray & R.J. Daddow.

Also the old veteran John Prior, Father Hutchins, Father Birt & Sam East.

The work of repairing and enlarging the hall goes on satisfactorily.  Last week the extended wall and roof were finished and anxiety over the western wall and the exposed roof from a westerly gale was ended.  Half the cost has been subscribed and trustees expect a speedy response and hope to finish without increasing the Â£200 debt on the building.

Rev. T.B. Angwin gave a lecture on Cornwall with music and lantern slides at the Methodist Lecture Hall on Wednesday.  Miss A. Pearce sang Dear Old Cornwall, Mr Fuss recited Lord Grenville and Mrs Angwin was at the piano and the Band played several selections.

Jubilee Hall.  The extended roof and wall were finished last week.
