Obituary.  Thomas Walsh died at Burra Hospital on 15 June after four days’ illness, aged 34.  He was the husband of Ellen Walsh of the Court House Hotel.  He was suddenly seized with inflammation of the bowels on Friday and was sent to hospital on Sunday.  Drs Brummitt and Sangster performed a successful operation on Monday, but he died several hours later.  He was much liked in the town on account of his unassuming manner and straightforwardness.  He was born in Kilkenny, Ireland in 1862, a son of Richard Walsh who survives him.  He was educated in Ireland and studied to be a schoolteacher.  He conducted a school on his own account.  At his sister’s request (Mrs O’Keefe, who resides near the Burra railway station) he came to SA.  Later he went to Sydney where he had a school.  Subsequently he left there and had a similar position in Wilmington.  In 1890 he arrived in Burra and took a lease on the Court House Hotel.  In 1893 he was elected Councillor for North Ward and fulfilled the job creditably for two years.  He was also a member of the Hospital Board and a generous donor to those in need.  His death deprives the town of a sterling and conscientious resident.  He is survived by a wife and young child.
