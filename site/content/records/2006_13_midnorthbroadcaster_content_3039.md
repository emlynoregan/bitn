Andrew Bence recalls his time as a National Serviceman in 1969-70, when he spent twelve months in Vietnam.  After recruit training at Puckapunyal there was artillery school at Northlead, Sydney and jungle training in Canungra, Queensland before going to Nui Dat in Vietnam in Number 105 field battery first field regiment.  He said that in the time spent there you got to see a lot of different things that werenâ€™t pretty, but you had to wipe it out of your mind as far as possible.  You felt it when you came home.  The sudden transition from the field to home came with no after-care and it was difficult to be accepted by the society they returned to.  He said Anzac Day meant a lot to him.  The Burra Dawn Service will be at 6.30 a.m. in Market Square.
