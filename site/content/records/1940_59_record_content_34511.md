Mt Bryan East was swept by grasshoppers in the last few weeks.  Lucerne paddocks were stripped in about three days â€“ about 700 acres of lucerne are in the area and they were just a mass of moving insects.  Home gar dens were also stripped.  Late wheat crops suffered.  They did not lay out there and hopefully they have saved that for areas near the city which might jolt the authorities into action.  There is also a minor rabbit plague.
