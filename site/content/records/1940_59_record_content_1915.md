Obituary.  Mrs Rhoda Elizabeth Fuss, who passed away at Aberdeen, on May 19th, after a residence of 66 years was born at Apollo Bay, Victoria on November 26th 1858.  The family later came to Victor Harbor, S.A., where her father, the late John Rumball, was appointed Superintendent of the Southern Tramways.  She was educated at that place at Miss Absolem’s school.  At the age of 16 she came to Burra where her father was transferred to the Burra Railway Station as station-master and lived here the rest of her life.  In 1881 she married Mr Charles Fuss who was Burra born.  Her husband predeceased her some years ago.  Mrs Fuss was a Vice-President of the Aberdeen Soldiers’ Aid Society during the Great War to which two of her sons, Ray and Hilary (An Anzac) went.  The deceased lady was a devoted member of and attended St Mary’s Church regularly until within two Sundays before her death.  She also for many years taught in St Mary’s Sunday School.  Her family of four daughters and five sons are all living.*  The funeral was conducted on Thursday last.  The service was first held in St Mary’s Church from which the cortege left for the Kooringa Cemetery.  Four sons and two grandsons acted as bearers; the service was conducted by Rev. C. Gray.

[* One son, Edgar, lived only a few hours.]
