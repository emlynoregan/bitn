A local thunderstorm on 29 October resulted in the CFS attending six reported fires.  One strike at 6.45 p.m. was just south of Burra, a call out east proved to be a false alarm.  Another was on Princess Royal Station.  Farrell Flat CFS attended two fires and the Booborowie and Mt Bryan units one each.
