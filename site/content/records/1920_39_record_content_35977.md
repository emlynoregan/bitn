Mr Frank Treloar was given a public farewell at the Institute on 6 November.

The mayor Mr A.B. Riggs presided.  [The report includes a good photograph of Mr Treloar.]

The Mayor said that after being in the district for over 40 years Mr Treloar would find leaving difficult, but keeping in touch with his family in Adelaide became increasingly difficult, especially with his wife’s ill health.  Burra was losing a figure whom many people in the district had looked to for advice over many years.  He included himself among them.

Ken Drew spoke on behalf of stock agents and district people.  Mr Treloar had been a faithful servant of Goldsbrough, Mort for many years and though he (Mr Drew) had technically been Mr Treloar’s boss for the last eight years, his advice had been invaluable in the bad times they had been enduring.  Mr Treloar was a great judge of stock, having been manager of Gum creek Station for a number of years.  He had done much to improve the breeding of horses, sheep, cows and dogs in the district.  He had quietly done much also to help those in need.  He had been secretary for many years of the Burra Hospital, the Hanson DC, the Agricultural Society (Burra Burra Show Inc.) and the Sports Syndicate.

A.G. Gebhardt spoke for the Sports Syndicate and endorsed what had been said and praised Mr Treloar’s efforts on behalf of the Syndicate especially.

Mr Bednall spoke for the Church and business people.  As a relative newcomer he found that when he wanted to know something Mr Treloar was always referred to as ‘the’ authority.  Mr Treloar was always painstaking and thorough in his work and a strong supporter of the church, who had kept its books for many years.

Mr J.H. Rogers spoke for the Hanson people.  Over 40 years ago he [Mr Treloar] had been Chairman of the Hanson DC and then for 27 years was District Clerk, a job which often saw him doing far more than he was paid for.

Mr H.G. Oates represented the RSL and endorsed all the previous remarks and said Mr Treloar’s advice had been invaluable.  He also read extracts from a letter received from Major Copley of Fischer, Copley Ltd who had worked for Mr Treloar in the office of Bagot, Shakes & Lewis Ltd before the Great War with further endorsements of the above comments.

The Mayor spoke on behalf of the town’s citizens who spoke along similar lines.  Mr Treloar’s thoroughness as an auditor allowed no detail to escape.  He had administered the Lewis Trust (Paxton Square) which took considerable time.  He also referred to Mr Treloar’s articles in the paper on the History of Burra.  He would also be missed at the meetings of ratepayers with his shrewd questions.  He presented Mr Treloar with a gold watch and chain and Mrs Treloar with a silver teapot.

Mr Treloar then spoke:

He said he had done nothing to deserve great praise other than to try to live a straight life and to help his fellow man.  His parents came to SA in the mid-1840s in the same ship at Mr Walters of the Burra Mine. [Mr Walters arrived in 1848 as resident manager of the Smelting Co. – see ‘The Monster Mine’]  His father was engaged and drove Mr Walters to Burra and also to Pt Wakefield to chose a place for the port.  His father then went to the Victorian gold diggings and he (the speaker) was born at North Adelaide just behind the Cathedral while his father was away.  His father returned successful and took land at Watervale now known as Springvale Vineyard.  At first the family had to live there in a tent until a house was built.  He went to school at Mr Coles’ school and at 14 to work for an auctioneer who went under after four years.  He then entered the wheat trade at Hoyleton, then the shipping station for all wheat grown to its north.  When the tramway became a railway and was extended to Blyth he had moved to farm at Orroroo.  By them he was married and they spent five years there on dry country – the greatest mistake of his life.  His first crop looked like 12 bushels to the acre, but the 200 acres were stripped bare in just 1½ days by locusts and he barely recovered seed wheat.  Year after year he lost his savings and then some £400 of his wife’s money too.  He eventually gave up and returned to Watervale and for six months was a wheat agent before being appointed as manager of Gum Creek Station at a time when that extended for 32,000 acres plus an eastern block.  The proprietors ran 100,000 to 130,000 sheep.  He did mostly the clerical work.  At the end of 18 years an incident occurred which he chose not to speak of, but which resulted in his leaving the station.  He moved to Burra where sympathetic people helped put him on his feet. (That was 31 years ago.)  When asked for advice he always tried to give his best.  He was proud to say he had returned to his wife the money of hers he had lost at Orroroo.  His writings on the history of Burra were a labour of love.  The mine had practically saved the colony from bankruptcy.  Burra from a commercial point of view was always a safe place because of its pastoral and agricultural wealth.  He believed that despite the difficult times there were good prospects ahead.  In his life he had only been a defendant in court once – when a ‘ferocious’ black and tan terrier of his had frightened a woman.  ‘It had cost him a fiver and he had to part with his poor little Rowdy.’  He had once been spoken to by the police officially when one cold wet night he had not been able to light his lamps driving in from the country, as every match blew out.  He tried to sneak past the police station, but the next day the Sergeant suggested he should make less noise when passing the station without lights.

Mt Treloar was farewelled at the last meeting of the Masonic Lodge and was presented with a handsome night clock with a luminous dial.

Mr Treloar was farewelled at James H. Roger’s residence in Aberdeen on Wednesday by old Councillors from the Hanson DC. Mr Denton spoke of his work while clerk there for 27 years and Mr Rogers made a presentation of a wallet.
