Matthews Emporium organised a Christmas Carnival last Friday.  Father Christmas arrived at 2.30 p.m. and was greeted by the local manager Mr Ed. Poore.  Matthews gave away no less than 850 bags of sweets to youngsters, many of whom had not seen Father Christmas during the war years.

1,500 people passed through the shop examining and purchasing most of the good things in Matthews well organised ‘Fairyland’.  Father Christmas departed Burra at 5 p.m.
