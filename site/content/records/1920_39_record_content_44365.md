Characteristics of the paper in 1932

Page 1

This typically carried a lot of news with some larger advertisements.

Page 2

Large advertisements from Bence’s and Drew & Crewes mixed with smaller advertisements and classifieds.  Public notices and advertisements for entertainment and sport were important.  The column ‘Personal information’ told of the comings and goings of local people on holidays and the like.  This has generally not been noted.  News items are also found.

Page 3

Large advertisements for Matthew’s Emporium were common along with smaller advertisements, but news dominated.

Page 4

Some large advertisements were mixed with some small ones and some news, but there were often also non-news items of general interest.

In general the paper carried less advertising than in most years and more news and non-news items of general interest.  Editorial comment is generally lacking.  There was a good coverage of local news with considerable attention to the Town Council and to news of developments at Mongolata.  Aspects of the depression were also well covered.
