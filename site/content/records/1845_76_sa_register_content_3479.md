The Burra Strike

We make a general appeal on behalf of the Men who became Committee Men during the Burra Burra Mine Strike as a consequence of their moral and general standing among their fellow miners.  This strike was remarkable for the exemplary conduct of a numerous body of men and the absence of any unmanly or vindictive outrage.  A letter from a correspondent, confirmed from other sources, reveals that these men are now doomed to the unrelenting vengeance of the Board and other mining companies have been written to with a view to their being denied employment across the industry.  We presume the gentlemen of the Board would be deeply offended if they were told this conduct was inhuman and unchristian, but so it is as long as they ignore the humanizing duty of forgiveness, which the Saviour taught.  Vindictive ness is doubly reprehensible in an infant colony where men of various creeds and callings and of endless varieties of disposition, make up an almost indivisible community.  The necessity has been suggested to us of a subscription list to aid these right-minded men, who have, with their families, been thrown out of bread by the issue of the late strike.

‘Spectator’ writes concerning the recent strike at Burra Burra Mine.

As a consequence of the strike the acting-captains are under strict instructions to afford no employment whatever to a select list of miners and the men of the committee.  These are the men who persevered to the end their prescribed path of duty as members of the committee.  Why are they to be selected for special vindictive retaliation and to see their families denied bread; simply because at the start of the strike, they were selected by their fellow miners as having perhaps a better capacity to see, and observe, and act on their behalf.  Having been unanimously elected to this duty, they discharged it manfully and without compromise.  Let me appeal to patriots, philanthropists and fellow colonists in general to crave your consideration and sympathy.  A considerable part of their duty was to see that good and peaceable order was maintained and the Company’s property was preserved without spoliation or injury and ‘bitterly hath Cæsar answered for it’.

I speak on indubitable information that gratuitous advice and earnest requests have been sent to other mines ‘on no consideration to employ’ these luckless prohibited Burra victims’.

Meanwhile most miners have been restored to employment under fair promises and driven by need.

I ask that the Gentlemen of the Press give publicity to this letter in your journals.
