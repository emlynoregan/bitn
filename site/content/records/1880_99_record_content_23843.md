Teetulpa Goldfield.  Another column on the field.  Some good finds are reported and many are said to be making wages.  There are occasional good finds: one young man getting £500-£600 worth only two feet under the surface in a day’s work.  In general a more systematic and steadier approach seems to be paying at least moderate dividends.
