The eastern country at present gets one mail a week, and even so many have to travel several miles to collect it.  A meeting on 17 July at Frank Treloar’s office in Commercial St will consider the establishment of a telephone line out to the eastern plains.  There is no doubt it would be a paying venture and no doubt therefore the Government will give a helping hand.
