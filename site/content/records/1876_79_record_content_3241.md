The Town Clerk, Mr C. Lowe reported no reply to his letter to the Govt re the water supply -' sent the previous Saturday.' [Council met on 10 Dec. so Sat. was 8 Dec. but they couldn't have expected a reply that quickly so presumably he meant the letter was sent Sat. 1 Dec. which would have been a timely despatch.]
