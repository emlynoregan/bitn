D. Rayfield & G.R. O’Connor wrote separate letters challenging the previous report of the meeting relating to Market Square.  In lengthy arguments their allegations are in essence:

There was disagreement about who should be allowed to attend the meeting.

The meeting was less amicable than portrayed in the article.

The agreed plan does not represent much of a change from the Council’s original position.

Agreement with it represents considerable backing down by those initially opposed to the proposal.

The essential change they object to is the loss of the curved roadway (despite the retention of its kerb line) thus destroying the 140-year-old character of Market Square.
