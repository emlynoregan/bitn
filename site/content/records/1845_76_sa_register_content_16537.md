SA Mining Association: The Burra Burra Mine [Editorial]

The 18th Annual Report was submitted to shareholders and adopted on 15 April.  The report is as gratifying as usual.  In the past half-year the ore raised amounted to 4,302 tons, estimated to contain 23% fine copper.  This is almost the same tonnage as the previous six months, but the percentage of copper is higher.  In the last six months the price of copper has risen.  Last November the price in Adelaide advanced from £87-10-0 to £91 per ton, at which rate the bulk of the copper raised during the six months was disposed of.  The Association has not made any shipments themselves during the half-year.  The report says the present price is £91 per ton, but since it was written the arrival of the English mails reports that it has fallen to £88.

In the half-year to 30 September 1862 the profit per ton sold was £1-7-8 in excess of the profit on the previous half-year, although the rise in price to £91 did not take place till November 1862.  Some of this improvement is due to decreased costs in producing the ore.  But even now it is shown that for the half-year for which the accounts are closed the ore raised, which cost the Association £9-8-5 per ton, sold for £12-18-9 per ton, against £11-18-10 per ton during the previous half-year when the cost of production was £9-16-2 per ton.  Hence the increased profit arises partly from reduced costs and partly from a better price.  In the six months to 30 September 1862 the ore raised was 4,631 tons at a cost of £43,638-17-9 and the nett proceeds on the sale of this ore was £59,917-11-5, leaving a profit of £16,278-13-8.  In addition rents produced £1,059-9-3 and fees £4-15-0 to give total half year profits of £17,342-17-11.  This sum went towards the payments of the two dividends of £12,320 each, which were declared in October and February last and there is now a balance of profit amounting to £4,301-11-2 besides produce undisposed of, which it is expected will realise £7,353-2-7, making together a balance of £11,654-13-9.

The report of the Mining Captain speaks in high terms of the mew pitches which have been opened in Peacock’s Main and Air Shafts and refers in an encouraging way to other workings.  In fact in all parts of the mine the reports are of a monotonous song of success.  Everything is in good working order and there are 88 pitches at work and ore raised in the last take of eight week was 1,350 tons.

At Karkulto Mine there are seven miners working on tribute at the 20 and 25 fathom levels.  The lode is three feet wide and is composed of more iron ore than copper.

Employees at 31 March 1863 numbered 635.

Mr Neville Blyth and Mr Thomas Neill were confirmed as auditors in place of Mr A. Hall (resigned) and Mr John Ellis (absent from the colony).  The retiring Directors were all re-elected.

The arrangements with the English & Australian Copper Co. expire next May and no new engagement has yet been entered into.
