Letter.

The issue of 4 July on page 2 had carried a letter from ‘A Week-in-Week Out Parent’ about the ‘Wanderer’ local football report – complaining that football reports were confined to the A and B Grades and wishing for some reporting of the minis team, the junior colts and the senior colts, whether from their coaches or from ‘Wanderer’.

This week ‘Benchwarmer’ and a ‘Proud BBH Supporter’ suggest there may be good reasons why ‘Wanderer’ confines reports to the A & B Grades and instead of suggesting that someone already doing something for the club does more, the critics should take up the burden themselves.
