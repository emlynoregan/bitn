Obituary.  Elkanah Cock died 5 August at Ayers Forest Reserve aged 58.  He was the husband of Flora Ann Cock.

E. Cock (Elkanah, known as Kenny.) was born at Porter’s Lagoon in 1862 and educated at Moonta Private School.  For 37 years he was employed by the Woods & Forest Department; 22 years at Bundaleer Forest and 15 years at Ayer’s Forest.  He was a keen sportsman and a member of the Caltowie Football Club and of the Jamestown & Belalie Cricket and Lacrosse Clubs and was starter for the Jamestown Racing Club for 30 years and for the Burra Racing Club since moving to the district.  He was interested in the Burra Show.  At Leighton his efforts are largely responsible for paying off £800 of the Leighton Hall debt.  In 1888 he married Miss Flora Campbell, eldest daughter of the late Angus Campbell of Jamestown who survives with three children: Messrs R. & Will Cock and Mrs R. McNeil.  There are two granddaughters.  [Registered as Elkanah Cocks born at Karkulto 29 August 1862.]
