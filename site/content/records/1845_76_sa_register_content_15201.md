As to the nature of the town itself:

‘…no neat fenced gardens or cultivated enclosures of any kind; the streets and roads (if such you may term them, for they have never cost anything to make or maintain) a vast crying nuisance from the filthy accumulations they contain; the Burra Creek itself, which at the bottom of the town runs through it about east and west, overcharged with ore shines from the mine dressing floors; the whole place nearly shut in by the adjacent hills from all prospect, and those hills themselves divest of tree, or plant, or trace of cultivation, or anything to relieve the dreary spectacle – picture to yourself, if you can, a locality embracing the foregoing characteristics, nothing overdrawn, and you have Kooringa, a scene of the wildest and most cheerless desolation in our experience.’

There is a population of some 4,500 souls and ‘there ought to be a flourishing and handsome town’. 

But it seems it is the result of the owners refusing to alienate the land except on short term leases of 21 years.  The Bible Christian Chapel is the exception, having obtained a 99-year lease.  The town has no Council machinery of any sort and hence its squalor.  Adjacent are Redruth (with the Court House and Gaol), Aberdeen and Copperhouse and these, while a slight improvement, ‘partake more or less of the withering aspect of their original’.  The reducing population due to the migration to Wallaroo has the storekeepers in violent competition for business.  [Continued 23 December.]
