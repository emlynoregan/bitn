Wal Watkins writes to the Burra Burra DC informing them that he is about to start writing a dramatic novel.  Having recently toured the state seeking a location for the novel, he was most impressed by Mongolata and congratulates all who have contributed to the preservation of the site and battery.  He says he was born at Burra and reared at Hallett.  Mongolata suits the needs of the novel admirably.  It will be his tenth.

[Walter James Watkins was born at Redruth 10 March 1922 to Albert Morton Watkins and Tillie Maria nee Smart.]
