Kooringa News, 10 June

Last Thursday a select ball was held at the Burra Hotel, but attendance was reduced by the wet and muddy conditions and the dark night.  Dancing continued till dawn.

The half-yearly meeting of the Wesleyan Mutual Improvement Association was held on Tuesday.  A goodly number attended a public tea meeting in the schoolroom.  Rev. H. Chester presided.  Speeches and addresses were delivered by Messrs J.R. Stephens and R.G. Wilkinson and a paper delivered by J. Burnell.  Recitations were given by Messrs W. Williams, W. Richards, T. Berriman and Sullivan.  A small choir comprising mostly Mr J. Pearceâ€™s family added to the enjoyment of the occasion.

Mr Parish brought around his models of naval vessels and exhibited them for two or three evenings, but finding this unprofitable, he got up a grand raffle and disposed of his entire fleet.
