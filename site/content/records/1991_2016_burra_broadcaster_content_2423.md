Manoora Anglican Church was deconsecrated on Sunday 4 December after almost 129 years of services.  About 60 people attended the service conducted by Rev. Peter Linn of the Anglican Parish of Auburn-Riverton.  The Education Department has purchased the land and building as extra room for the Manoora Primary School to house drama and library facilities.

The Church of Emmanuel was consecrated in October 1864.  The churchâ€™s formal name was the Church of England, Church of Emmanuel, Chingford.  It was built of local stone.  In 1905 it was upgraded and the chancel was paved in Mintaro slate.  The furnishings will be distributed to other Anglican churches and three stained glass windows will be replaced and it is hoped will be retained at a suitable place in Manoora.  They commemorate Mary Anne & Jabez Frost, James Jones and the Byerlee Family.  The closure of the church became inevitable when only three families were attending the bi-monthly services.
