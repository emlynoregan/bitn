J.F. Hogan writes re a comment that now Kooringa had won the football shield Booborowie would not compete for it.  The situation goes back some 40 years or so.  In the early 1920s Burra did not play in the present Association, but for another shield in the Kooringa Association.  At the time South Booborowie held the old Burra Shield.  Prominent Burra supporters at the time wanted South Booborowie to hand the Shield back on the grounds that it was a Burra Shield and should, when not in use, be in the Burra Institute.  The Booborowie teams were then playing for the Old Koomooloo Shield presented by I.J. Warnes.  South Booborowie’s reply at the time was ‘If you want the Shield back do as we did – win it.’  The Burra supporters said if they did win it, it would not again be allowed to leave Burra.  Now about 40 years ago the late Adolph Lott collected for the Shield and the inscription is approximately ‘Presented by the people of Burra and District etc.’  It is not therefore exclusively a Burra Shield and should not be hedged with restrictions.  We challenge Burra to play for the Shield next year under the same conditions as exist at present/
