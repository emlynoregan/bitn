Burra Town Council met on Monday to consider the £300 unemployment grant from the Government.  Each married man is to be given four days’ work and after that each single man is to get one day’s work.  Any balance after that is to be balloted for by married men with three or more children.  Council has accepted the grant.  £100 will be allotted to each ward.
