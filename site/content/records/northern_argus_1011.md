Market Square

About 45 members of the Burra Preservation Organisation blocked Market Square with cars and trucks at 6 a.m. last Thursday to stop Council workers from proceeding with the re-development.  By mid-morning about 20 remained and when a bulldozer moved in several protestors stepped onto its blade, halting work for the day.  On Friday Council workers began at 6 a.m. and removed grass in the square’s centre while police restrained a small group of protestors.  Secretary of BPO Derek Rayfield said the BPO had been prepared to sit down and compromise last Thursday, but all requests had been ignored.  Eunice Baker, a member of BPO, said although she felt uncomfortable participating in the blockade, she saw it as a last ditch attempt to preserve the square.

BPO believes the proposed changes with road widening and new car parking spaces would destroy the historical character of the square and restrict the free flow of traffic.  Burra District Clerk Rod Walsh said the changes were needed to improve traffic management.

A petition prepared by BPO was signed by more than 800 people.  Council Chairman James Hawker said people had been misled about the changes and intimidated into signing the petition.  A blatantly inaccurate map of the changes had accompanied the petition.

Derek Rayfield in a letter to the Argus blamed the Council itself for the story regarding the removal of the Rotunda and the rose garden.  He denied any improper actions in collecting the 819 signatures.  Council has said in a circular that the lack of formalised parking arrangements results in illegal parking and hazardous traffic manoeuvres and Council fears for its legal position in the event of accidents.

Last November 570 people signed a petition calling a halt to the installation of new electricity [i.e. light] poles in Market Square.  They deemed the standard goose-necked poles unsuitable for a heritage town and as a result those installed were removed.  Council now proposes to install round-type ETSA post-top lights and there will be no goose-neck poles.

In January the re-development was halted when the Community Employment Program notified Council that an oversight had been made in not getting the changes approved by the Australian Heritage Commission.  A meeting in Adelaide on 21 February resulted in the State Heritage Branch indicating its assent for the scheme to continue.  The estimated cost for the project is $109,000 of which $50,000 comes from a J150 Local Government Road Assets Program loan with a subsidised interest rate of 9% for 12 years and a grant of $54,000 from the Community Employment Program.  Council’s contribution is $5,800.
