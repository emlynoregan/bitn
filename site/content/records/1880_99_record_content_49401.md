[The version in the paper had more elaborate underlinings.]

Symon asked if Hardy thought it abusive of the defendant.

Hardy said he did not especially intend it to be offensive and said he did not know what ‘Anguis in Herba’ meant.

Symon, ‘Did you think it meant ‘A snake in the grass’?

Hardy, ‘I don’t know.’

Symon, ‘Are you in the habit of writing things to people not knowing what they are?’

Hardy, ‘No.’

Symon, ‘Why not sign your own name instead of a Greek name?’

Hardy, ‘No particular reason.’

Symon, ‘Is it not a fact you have been continually animadverting and holding [Davey] up to contempt in the Jamestown Review and other papers?

Hardy, ‘Not to contempt.’

Hardy said he had only said there was a general view that Holder wrote the leaders and not that it was so.

Symon then produced a letter Hardy admitted to writing to Davey on 29 Jan. 1892 in which he accused Davey of ‘Consumate inconsistency and Bare Faced editorial Subservency’ for Davey’s footnote to a Hardy letter in the previous issue.

‘You assert that in reference to the Water Works Engineer, that it is only personal spite on my part towards Mr Littlejohn I say Sir such assertions are but a series of Deliberate and Bare faced Falsehoods and only concoctable by unprincipaled persons of Illiterate Bearing from Party and selfish motives.’

[The letter continued with similar hyperbole.]

Lunch was taken and afterwards Hardy continued to give evidence.

A postcard of his was produced and again it was a peculiarly worded document which could have been interpreted, like the earlier letter from kouos, as a threat.  The card read:

‘Be Careful ____ Bad intentions vide so called Leader to Day’s Record But I have written before the Copy was ever intended for publication in your (?) paper and it bore strong Internal evidence INALTO RELIEVO to that effect ____ It was simply meant as EMETI ____ CARTHARTIC ____ The IMPRINATUS of the Record states that it Is printed and PUBLISHED by W.J. DAVEY I shall make the said W.J. Davey responsible For everything Slander – our – or of a U B BLODE type in the Record hence it will pay you to keep your EYE OPEN I am watching to see when BAIT is used this time on Your hook Remember Firm and fearless &c is a lie take it out or don’t Pander

Yours WITH BOTH EYES OPEN

Feb 3/92 	OUOs’

Symon asked if the U B BLODE section was a reflection on what Hardy thought Davey’s article on the vote of censure in the Feb. 3 paper was worth.

Hardy, ‘Yes.’

Symon, ‘In the sentence ‘firm and fearless’ etc. you meant to convey the motto was a lie?’

Hardy, ‘Yes.’

When asked if a series of his statements were meant to be offensive Hardy replied,

‘No, not necessarily.’

He said the postcard held by the postmaster, Mr Lane, was held because there was no name put to it, not because it was offensive.  When pressed, Hardy said of Mr Lane,

‘I don’t know what he did say.’

Bur when asked if he understood from Lane that it was not quite so respectable as it ought to be Hardy said yes.
