Obituary.  Sir Frederick Holder died on 23 July in Melbourne.

Sir Frederick Holder, Speaker of the House of Representatives, had an apoplectic seizure after an all-night sitting discussing the Old Age Pension.  He was greatly respected as Speaker for his fairness.  He collapsed on the floor of the House at 6.30 a.m. and died without regaining consciousness at 4 p.m.  He was born at Happy Valley in SA on 12 May 1850, the son of Morecott Holder.  A promising student, he was induced to become a teacher and accepted a position under the Education Dept.  He however, felt he would do better as a journalist and secured possession of the Burra Record of which he became editor. He wrote columns also for the Advertiser and to the English newspapers.  While still editor of The Record he became Mayor of Burra.  In 1887 he was elected to the SA House of Assembly at the head of the poll, along with W.B. Rounsevell with the latter edging out Sir John Cockburn by 5 votes.  (Sir John then got elected for Mt Barker.)

On 27 June 1889 he became Treasurer of SA in the Cabinet of Sir John Cockburn.

He was renowned for thoroughness and helpfulness and was never factious in opposition.  In policy he was consistent.  Of the 22 years in SA and Federal Parliaments he was a Minister or Speaker for all but three of them.  He represented the same constituents throughout.  In the SA Parliament he represented Burra and was elected to Federal Parliament first on a State-wide basis and then re-elected for Wakefield, which included Burra.  He was a strong supporter of Federal Union.

When the Commonwealth was formed he was Premier of SA.  In SA he was mostly Treasurer, but for a while under the Kingston Government when he was Commissioner of Public Works.  The state funeral took place in Adelaide on Monday and thousands attended despite torrential rain.
