The Burra Tourist Office is under new management.  Jenny & Denny O’Connor have successfully tendered for the management of the tourist office as from 1 October.  The operation will be on the same lines as at present.  They hope also to offer two guided tours – an historic one and a ‘Breaker Morant’ one.
