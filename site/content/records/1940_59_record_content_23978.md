Obituary.  Mr C.J. Pearce died on Sunday morning 21 October.  The late Mr Pearce was born 90 years ago at Springbank and was a son of the late Mr & Mrs W.H. Pearce of Burra.  In his youth he was apprenticed to Mr H.W. Bruce, who was a cabinetmaker and undertaker.  In 1876 he married Miss Agnes Morton Thomas and set up in business on his own.  The business prospered and with his son, Lisle Pearce, he carried it on until about six years ago, when he and his wife retired to Adelaide.  The late Mr Pearce was very interested in his home town of Burra, and although not particularly active on committees etc., he gave generously to anything pertaining to the welfare of the community.

In the Rechabite Lodge circles he was known for having been the secretary of the Rose of Sharon Tent of the Lodge for 63 years.  The late Mr & Mrs Pearce lived together as husband and wife for 69 years, until Mrs Pearce died about three weeks ago.  They are survived by four daughters and two sons: Evelyn (Mrs Flint of Kingston), Nita (Mrs Howarth of Koolunga), Misses Annie and Millie (of Malvern), Lisle (of Burra) and Andrew (of Sydney).  [Charles James Pearce, born 10 March 1856 at Springbank (Burra) and died 21 October 1945 at Malvern, making him 89 rather than 90.]
