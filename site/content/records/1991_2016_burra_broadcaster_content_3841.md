BCS.  Reports on 5BCSâ€™s test broadcast are coming in.  The signal seems to have been heard easily around the town and along the by-pass road.  A small amount of interference with some Adelaide TV channels was reported and steps to overcome that are being investigated.  Reception to the east extended only to the top of the hill.
