Burra Hospital has a new $2,500 drugs trolley.  This was presented to it by the Bush to Burra Committee Chairman Simon Rowe last week.  The trolley had been on the hospital’s wish list for some time and came as a result of the last successful cattle drive.  A number of other organisations in the Mid-North also benefited from the money raised.  This year’s drive is planned for 1 to 5 October.
