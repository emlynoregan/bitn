Aberdeen Football Club

Past players of the club met to discuss the closing of the club and the disposal of its assets.  The unanimous decision was to donate their property in Burra North to the Burra Burra DC with the suggestion it be used as a Care and Recreation Centre for the aged.

There are three provisions:

The transfer to be at no cost to the Football Club.

That it be used as an Aged Care and Recreation Centre.

That an archive area be set aside for the Aberdeen Football Club.

Since 1974 the premises have been maintained by the Womenâ€™s Committee led by Mrs Florrie Scroop.  The proposal will go before Council on 12 December.
