Burra Civic Jubilee Ball

The Governor and Lady Dunstan arrived at 9 p.m. and were welcomed by the Chairman of the Council, James Hawker, and his wife Penny and a good crowd that had assembled on the footpath.  They were introduced to Councillors and the Ball Committee.  The Governor in his speech said that his great great grandfather had walked to Burra in 1847 and the family had at one time lived in the dugouts, so his Burra connection was real and meaningful.  He was presented with a copy of Ian Auhlâ€™s new book as a memento of his visit.

Many people attended in period costume.  Before leaving at 11 p.m. the Governor cut the Jubilee Cake with his sword.  The whole evening was a very great success.

Burra Rural Youth held its AGM.  The retiring President Peter Jarvis said Burra Rural Youth had survived in an era when state-wide the organisation was in a slump and when in this area competition for the interest of young people has increased at the same time as the number of them has fallen.  The innovative program for the year met with mixed success.  Elected for 1986-87 were: President, Kym Earle; Secretary, David Hill and Treasurer, Jane Kellock.

Burra Bowling Club at its AGM elected President, R.B. Jennison; Vice-Presidents, L. Saunders & R. Short; Secretary, R.F. Jamieson and Treasurer, R. Stockman.  Outgoing President John Maidment reported on a busy and financially successful year.  The greens had been kept in great condition. The bar had played a major part in raising funds and the ladies had a vital role in supporting the club.

The Harris Family from Hallett Police Station has moved to Murray Bridge.

Jim Low is away for six weeks as Acting Principal at Koolunga.

Burra Apex Club will hold a film evening at Burra Town Hall on Saturday 28 June.

Ron Howard & Don Ameche in Cocoon.
