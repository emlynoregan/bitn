In 1988 an archaeological study was undertaken on the site of the old White Hart Hotel and in a brief time a 70 page document was produced.  The Croquet Club, which was located behind the hotel site, got only a brief mention, along with some photos of the pavilion/clubroom to be demolished as part of the new road scheme.  In 1916 the White Hart (of some 22 rooms) was being used as a residence and was owned by Mr James Reed.  It was among the oldest buildings in the town, having been erected in 1851.  A fire in 1916 created great damage and by 1928 there was little of the building left.  In later years this area adjoining the croquet club was cleared up and trees were planted to beautify the ground.
