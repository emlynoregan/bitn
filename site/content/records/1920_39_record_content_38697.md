Burra Rifle Club AGM.  Captain H.R. Oates presided.  Attendance was 18.  The Mayor attended to distribute the prizes.  Report for the year:

The year started £7-8-10 in credit.  Repairs of c. £20 brought the range to equal ant in SA.  This required a small overdraft and led to a drive for more members.  The defence Dept. allows a credit in cash and ammunition equivalent to 21/6 for every man passed as efficient.  In the last three years membership has been 28 and the highest ever was 60 in 1901.  Membership this year has risen to 85 with the aim of having 100 next year.  The Burra Open Prize Meeting on Anzac Day was very successful and the Limbless Soldiers match v. Eudunda allowed £2-3-0 to be sent to that society.  Members were successful at a number of events elsewhere in the state.  Burra won four of the five contests with other clubs this year.  We thank the Warnes family and C.W. Gare for use of the land on which the range is located.  Next year, given the increased membership, the club should be in substantial credit.  [Prizes are then listed – the principal ones having already been noted.]

Elected were Captain, H.G. Oates; Vice-Captain, W.V. Bass; Secretary, W. Ryan & Treasurer, K. Parton.  The club decided to join the 50th Infantry Battalion as a reserve.
