Mr & Mrs Merv. Humphrys will be farewelled at the Burra Methodist Church after the evening service on Sunday.  They will soon be moving to the city.

A ‘Shearer’ Cabaret in Burra Town Hall on Friday night raised $250 for Burra Hospital – worth $750 when subsidised.  It was organised by Mr C.E. Irlam.
