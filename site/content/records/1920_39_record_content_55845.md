Accident.  Three young men: Jack Robins, Horace James & Walter Williams, borrowed a car to attend a wedding on Saturday afternoon.  About two miles south of Mt Bryan, opposite Collins’s Stud Park, the car overturned twice on loose gravel at a corner and was thrown right over the fence.  The three occupants were thrown clear, but rendered unconscious.  Robins suffered a broken collar bone and a lacerated arm and the others were bruised and shaken.
