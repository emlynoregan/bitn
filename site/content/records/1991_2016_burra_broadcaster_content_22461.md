The Burra Branch of Friends of the Heysen Trail built a shelter on the Wandillah Creek with money donated when the Burra & Districts Lions Club disbanded in 1997.  After that the Department of Sport and Recreation financed the purchase of $3,000 worth of materials to build two more shelters â€“ one at Wiry Creek and one at Caroona Creek.

[Note that this article does not indicate when any of the three shelters mentioned were erected.]
