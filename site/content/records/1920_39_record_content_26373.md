Handel’s Messiah.

Portions of the work have been presented at intervals since 1902 by the Burra Choral & Orchestral Societies and later by the Institute Choral & Orchestral Classes.  In 1903 the Choral & Orchestral Societies combined with the Clare Societies (also trained by Mr Dane) to give a memorable performance in both towns.    The forces were again combined this year.  The orchestra of 18 local players was assisted by leading players from Adelaide.  The chorus numbered 170 and was on a special platform.  Mr Dane trained the Burra group and Mrs Charles Perry (nee Miss Muriel Day of Clare) trained the Clare group.  Two of the principals were local: Mrs Max Pearce (nee Miss Nell Herbert) and Mr E.A.W. Haese, tenor.  The bass was Mr E.F. Derbyshire of Adelaide.  The detailed review runs for 1½ columns.  The performance was a notable success in all ways and was repeated the following evening in Clare.  [Burra Institute 28 March.]
