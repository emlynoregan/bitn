Sunday Closing. There was a meeting of about 70 people at the Inst. last Friday to consider a response to the proposal to repeal Nock’s Act which limits Sunday trading in liquor. The Mayor took the chair. 
Rev. R.W. Campbell moved that in the opinion of this meeting the Nock’s Act has not had a fair trial, no valid reasons for its repeal, and it is to be regretted that attempts to repeal it are being made. 
At first the idea was to ban all Sunday trade, but for travellers over 10 miles. This would have closed suburban hotels so the compromise was for 2 hour trading and a reduction in the distance for bona fide travellers to 5 miles. It had only been in for 4 months. ¾ of a column follows before Rev. W. Jenkin 2 and the motion was carried unanimously. 
Rev. W. Richards moved that: ‘A Sunday Closing Act conduces to morality’. 2nd Mr Sleep and carried unanimously. 
Mr Holder moved ‘That this meeting pledges itself to support those candidates for the Upper House who are favourable for a Sunday Closing Act’. The Bill repealing Nock’s Act had passed stages 1 & 2 in the Lower House with big majorities and the Upper House was the only hope of stopping it. Mr W. Pearce 2nd Rev. Jenkins moved and amendment that the meeting pledge themselves to vote for those candidates who were in favour of the Nock’s Act provided they believed them to be as good in all other respects as other candidates. Mr Burrows Carried — but the majority in the hall were not in favour of either the amendment of the motion. [Presumably this suggests many abstentions on this issue.]
