Burra High School Parents & Friends’ Association held its AGM at the school on 16 March and elected: President, Mrs A. Benger; Vice-Presidents, Mesdames D. Thomas & A.H. Williams; Secretary, Mrs G.F.J. Lomman, Assistant Secretary, Mrs D.H. Field and Treasurer, Mrs W.H. Brook.

Headmaster R.M. Farrow handed over a cheque for almost £100 representing the initial instalment of the Voluntary Contributions for the year.

The President reported a membership of 61 and an average attendance of 37.  The project for the year was the erection of a dressing shed for girls, but later we learnt the Department might supply this, so it was decided instead to spend £100 on Physical Education equipment and £100 on the library.  Income from the school sports afternoon tea was used to offset bus expenses for the Inter-High School Sports trip to Riverton in May.  The High School Ball at the end of Term 2 was a social and financial success and just over £100 was made.  The Christmas Banquet was a very enjoyable occasion when approximately 200 were catered for.  Approximately 120 parents attended an informative talk by Mr Farrow in February – on the coming year’s work.
