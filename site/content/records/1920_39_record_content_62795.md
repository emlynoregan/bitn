Accident.  Mr Jack Parsons, labourer of Burra, got a lift to Aberdeen last week with Mr H. Hill of Hill & Co. Carriers.  He rode on the driverâ€™s side, but sitting outside the cabin.  On arriving at Best Place, he asked where they were going next and when they said they were going to the station, he decided to go along.  At the station he got off and they loaded their vehicle.  After some backing and turning they drove out the gates from the goods shed.  Soon after reaching the main road they felt a bump and immediately pulled up.  They were amazed to see Mr Parsons lying on the road.  Neither Mr Hill nor Mr Seaford the driver had known he had decided to return with them.  Apparently he had decided to return with them and was attempting to ride on the near side running board when he fell off.  The lorry passed over him just below the hip bone.  Had the vehicle not had double wheels, he must have been killed and he is still a very sick man.  He is about 50 years old and only got out of hospital about a week ago.  Dr Stevens treated him and he was taken to the Burra Hospital.

[This is probably the John Parsons who died 4 October 1936 at Kooringa, aged 45.  He may have been the John Andrew Parsons born 13 October 1891 at Hallett.]
