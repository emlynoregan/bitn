In 1967 parishes were re-aligned and Burra joined with the Clare-Blyth parish.  Colin Heinrich is then noted as the first Sunday school teacher.  On 21 August 1967 the existing Burra Lutheran Church arrived on a low loader from Mansfield Park.  The building was placed on newly acquired land at Burra North and dedicated on 5 November 1967.  In 1968 David Munzberg was elected Sunday school superintendent and Mr Kleinig as a teacher.  At times lessons were held in the back seat of a car until the late Mr P. Beinke kindly lent his house.  This became unsatisfactory when numbers increased to make three classes.  Classes were then held in the vestry, porch and hall of the church.  Eventually it was possible to obtain a four-roomed building at Milang for $650.  It arrived in Burra in January 1976 and was sited north of the church.  The building required considerable repairs and repainting.  This work has now been completed.  There are presently 27 children on the roll with three helpers, three relief teachers, four teachers and a Sunday school superintendent.
