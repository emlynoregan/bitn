Burra Town Hall

Burra Community Development Program and Burra Cultural Centre Committee have managed to obtain grants to upgrade the Town Hall.  The Regional Assistance Program grant has allowed the appointment of a Project Manager, Tiffany Chapman.  The aim is to increase hall use by expanding the range of functions that the hall can accommodate.  Paul Williams has been appointed Manager of the Burra Community Internet Centre, which will be located in the Hall.  Burra CWA has generously assisted the refurbishment of one of the front rooms.  This was officially opened in November as the Mary Warnes Room in honour of the founder of the CWA in SA, who was a district resident.  As well as being used by the CWA for its monthly meetings, it is available as a seminar, training or small meeting room for up to 20 people.

The kitchen has also been upgraded with a six-burner commercial gas oven and a commercial dishwasher.  Storage facilities will be increased with two lockable cupboards under the gallery stairs.  Quotes are being obtained for a new set of stage curtains and upgrading of the stage lighting.  Live performances have declined in recent years, in part due to substandard facilities.

The room that is being transformed into the Internet Centre has been emptied, repainted, rewired and carpeted and will be air-conditioned.  It is intended to extend cabling to the Mary Warnes Room and the Main Hall, offering Internet, Email and data projection facilities to hirers.  The BCC has also been working on developing a Volunteer Team for the Hall.  These people would:

Act as guides for tourists in the display and museum areas

Undertake general handyman and maintenance work

Attend to gardening needs at the front of the Hall

Co-ordinate catering

Assist in event management

Assist in running the Internet Centre

Assist in marketing and promotion.
