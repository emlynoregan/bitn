Burra Town Council

The Town Clerk submitted approximate statements of receipts and expenditure for the coming year which showed a probable debit balance of £143.

Various minor works were approved.

Several tenders were received for the demolition of the old house known as Camp’s and the Council accepted that of William Carpenter to do the work and pay £5 if Council would allow him to break the stone into 2½” metal and store it on the bank of the creek till required.
