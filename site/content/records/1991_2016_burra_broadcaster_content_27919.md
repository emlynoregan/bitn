Julie Monfries President of Friends of the Heysen Trail writes.

[She deplores the actions which have led to the closure of a section of the trail.  She feels that much of the blame should be slated home to people who are not bona fide walkers â€“ such as people on motorcycles, in 4WDs and with dogs.  She hopes for a resolution through negotiation that will satisfy everyone.]
