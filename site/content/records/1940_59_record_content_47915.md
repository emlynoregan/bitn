Burra Hospital Board received an amended plan from Mr Dean Berry on Friday.  Earlier plans for additions and renovations were costed at over £72,000.  The revised plan is for a £50,000 new wing to be added to the Maternity Wing and for £15,000 to renovate and divide the existing hospital into nurses’ quarters.  The Director General of Medical Services was interviewed by Mr Berry and he considered the proposed layout ideal and approved the plan.  The new plan is a smaller version of the earlier one, with twenty-five beds in the main hospital and ten on the Maternity Wing.  The plan was thoroughly discussed and with some suggested minor modifications will be put to a combined meeting of the Board and the Building Committee.

Mr Berry said hospital authorities in the Eastern States were amazed that hospitals could be built in SA for about £2,000 a bed.  In Victoria and NSW the figure was about £3,000.  The building and alterations would take about two years to complete.  Government approval will now have to be obtained and permits for materials sought, as well as an interview with respect to the Government subsidy.
