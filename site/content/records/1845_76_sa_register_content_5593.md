27 December 1850.  After breakfast we set out for the Burra through vast undulating plains of a light red and brown colour.  There was no vegetation higher than a blade of spear grass to be seen, except upon some very distant hills.  The only watercourse we crossed was the Hill River.  At about 1 p.m. we entered the Burra by way of the Sydney Mine [i.e. the Bon Accord Mine], which is merely an excavation here and there, waiting for machinery.  At the Burra great preparations were in hand for the races.  We were struck by the sombre effect of the place; all the houses being built of stone, and the stone the same colour as the sand and being well peppered with the Burra dust.

The hills having no trees, there was nothing to relieve the eye as it wandered over the uniform whitey-brown colouring of hill, valley and house, but this did not in the least interfere with the bustle of the place.  There was plenty of coming and going, loading and unloading, etc.

‘In passing over the bridge leading to the Smelting Works, a picturesque feature struck upon my astonished gaze, viz., the “creek habitations;” which are nothing more or less than excavations of a small size in the banks of a rivulet, at the present time supplied with water from the engines at the mine.’

‘As far as the eye can reach down the creek, the human wombat holes are to be seen – one long hole for a door, and a small square or round one for a window; a perfect street, with above 1,500 residents.’

The Burra Creek is riddled like a honeycomb.  From the bridge a fine view of the Mine on the west and of the Smelting Works on the east is obtained.  Both are astonishing, given the age of the place; less than five years.

I took up my quarters at the residence of the hospitable clergyman and sallied forth to visit the place.  From the top of the hill the whole Mine with its pumping engine, numerous shafts, whims, jigging sheds and appurtenances, beds of assorted ores, men and animals, noise and activity, burst upon my view.

I descended one of the shafts 35 fathoms and, accompanied an obliging miner with a candle in one hand, now stooping, now crawling, now ascending, now descending through gallery, pit, adit, level etc.  The commentary suggested that the mine had been sinking, filling up places and rendering some very dangerous.  The ore seemed to be mixed with the earth, not in veins.
