Burra Town Council

Mr Walker was granted permission to build a residence.

Mr Bosisto said that a number of promises for the Fire Brigade had not been redeemed.  Originally it was considered the proposed initial cost of c. £173 would be met because it would save business people and others in fire insurance premiums.  It was thought such people would be prepared to pay one year’s premiums towards the cost, but in fact the largest donation had been £5-5-0, even though some savings were as much as £50 p.a.  Attempts to organise concerts etc. had also failed and in the end only £51-8-6 had been handed in.  People had been waited on a number of times.

Cr Kellaway said the Council was now in a difficult position: the fund was £121 in arrears and the Council would have to find the money.  Had he known this would be the outcome he would not have voted for the brigade.

Mr Allen said Cr Kellaway was out of order in placing the whole blame on the deputation.

Mr Bosisto said if everyone had given one year’s savings the sum would have easily been raised.  The Underwriters’ Assoc. will be approached.
