Rev. E. Smith of Kooringa Methodist Church gave an address on 10 August on Sunday Observance that is reported at length.  He was opposed to sport on Sunday or anything else that remotely approached ‘the Continental Sunday’.  He recommended ‘several miles across the country on a Sunday morning, alone, or in congenial company’.
