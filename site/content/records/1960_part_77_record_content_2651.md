Dr L.G. Miller has been inspecting places where kitchen, bath and laundry waste water has been directed into watertables or other Council property and has been devising alternative arrangements.  It was decided to give such persons three months notice to correct such faults.

A decision of street signs was held over for two months, pending a patent decision on a type of ‘Scotch Light’ sign.

Grave fees had been fixed at £10.  Now children’s graves were fixed at £5 and those of stillborn babies at 30/-.

A wall had blown down recently at the rear of the Clerk’s residence.  It was decided to replace it with 3 foot iron.

Dr R.B. Pitcher had been elected as Councillor for West Ward in place of Cr Cummins.

The Clerk is taking drastic action to bring in outstanding rates.

Council decided to accept the offer of the District Council’s Depot area in Kingston Street for £100 plus transfer costs.

Cr Lloyd reported that the footbridge at Gully’s Wharf was considered unsafe.  The uprights had rotted away in the concrete foundations and the whole structure had dropped.

Cr Fisher suggested that the Queen Street [footbridge on the western side] was now excellent and at no great cost to Council and he would like to see similar repairs at Gully’s Wharf.

The Overseer was ordered to make the bridge temporarily safe.

It was moved that the old Town Council Depot be offered to the Burra Bowling Club at £100 plus transfer costs, subject to the successful transfer of the District Council land for their depot.
