Burra Unemployment.  On Monday afternoon at the Burra Hotel 35 unemployed men met.  The Mayor was surprised at the number as work for 50 was offered at Oodnadatta and only 12 were going.  One problem was that it cost £2-18-0 for a return fare with no guarantee of the length of employment.  F. Thomas was going – he said the work would last at least two months and probably six.

M-C Queale said he believed it was for 9/- a day for 5 days a week and tucker would cost 15/- a week.

A voice said that meant working for £5 for 9 weeks after paying for fares.

After a vote 15 said they would go for 2 months guaranteed work, but 16 declined.

Relaying work on the northern line was stopped due to lack of funds.  There will be some work on the Morgan line soon and a railway reservoir will be built near Burra if a suitable site can be found.

It is said there are about 70 unemployed in the town.
