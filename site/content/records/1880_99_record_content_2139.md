Burra Flower Show, Institute, 11 November.

This was a thorough success.  The flowers were much beyond what could have been dreamt of only a year ago and much improved on last year.  Mr Fuss secured nearly all the honours for petunias and phlox.  Captain Killicoat had the best roses, with Mr Rogers not far behind.  Plants in pots were led by Messrs Cave and Pearce and Miss Pearce.  Other exhibitors of note were Mr Oppermann, Mr Loutit, Mr Packard, F.W. Holder and Dr Brummitt.
