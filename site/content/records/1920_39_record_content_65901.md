Burra Institute AGM was held 23 February with Vice-President E.F. Marsden in the chair.  The lack of subscribers attending was, as usual, disappointing.  Apart from the committee four subscribers were present.  Book in the library on 1 January 1936 numbered 7,564 and on 31 December 1936 there were 7,138.  Free scholarship tickets were again allotted to the best scholars at Burra & Copperhouse Schools.  (Juvenile subscribers pay 6/- p.a.)  General subscribers pay 16/- p.a. to borrow 2 books and 1 magazine or 20/- to borrow 4 books and 2 magazines.  Membership increased slightly:

31 December 1935	Double	59	31 December 1936	Double	60

Single	122		Single	146

181			206

Finance: Money in the bank:	31 December 1935	£59-3-3

31 December 1936	£57-15-6

Mr A.A. Davey has continued as Librarian and was given an increase in salary, though not yet to the pre-depression level.

Elected: President, E.F. Marston; Vice-President, P.L. Rosman; Treasurer, Max Pearce; Secretary, M.W. Bednall.  The Centenary Committee has donated £41.
