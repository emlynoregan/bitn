Harry Vivian is 58 and full of geniality, sympathy and kindness.  He was ‘carted’ to Burra in a bullock dray with his parents in 1855 and became a cowboy at the mines and later was a bullock driver for 19 years.  He took wool etc. to Pt Adelaide and made his first trip to the Barrier in 1863.  He was bullocky for Harry Skews and Mr John Pearce of the Mt Bryan Hotel.  He took a public-house in 1881 and was licensee of Opie’s for six years before moving to the Commercial Hotel where he has been ever since.
