Utica Copper Mine.  Some time ago an engine and pump were fixed 30 feet in the drive from the 100’ level saving unnecessary rods, gearing etc. had it been placed at the top of the shaft.  The exhaust was carried well up the shaft and helped create a draught of cool air which improved working conditions.  On Saturday when six men were working in the drive the exhaust somehow became disconnected and filled the shaft with fumes.  The men were trapped and help had to be got from above.  The engine was, of course, stopped and candles put out to save oxygen.  T. Geach managed to climb the shaft, barely reaching the top.  Messrs Duldig & C. McWaters happened along and the men were hauled up one by one in the bucket.  There should have been some ventilation from a 10” winsell, but it was a calm day and the winsell, being canvas, sagged and stopped the airflow.  With hindsight the winsell should have been of iron.  Involved were Mr C.W.H. Saunders of Horwood & Co. who installed the plant, Thomas Geach, H. Broad, William Pryor Sen., T. Pryor Jun., and W. Irlam.
