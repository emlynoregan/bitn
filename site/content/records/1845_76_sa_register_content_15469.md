Kooringa News, 3 April

Obituary/Inquest.  On Sunday Mr MacDermott SM held an inquest into the death of William Nicholls, who had died from injuries received the previous Thursday.  Joseph Bray and Robert Northy were riding with the deceased on Thursday from Dryhill Pound to Macnamara’s Pound near Redruth.  Nicholls had wanted to try the speed of his horse.  He asked the pair to ride ahead and he would catch up.  This was done, but on reaching them Nicholls checked his horse suddenly and he either fell or sprang off the animal while it was still in motion.  He was still holding the reins and was jerked forward onto his head, rupturing a blood vessel in the brain.  He lingered in great pain till Saturday night or Sunday morning and leaves a wife and three children.

[William Nicholls died 30 March 1862, Kooringa aged 32.]
