Burra North’s Uptown Gallery had a successful art sale on Saturday with extreme heat proving no deterrent to the supportive group of buyers.  The sale featured 40 works of Aboriginal art in three styles of painting.  The sale runs to 20 December.  [Photo of Tom Marshall of the Uptown Gallery with Maureen Wright.]
