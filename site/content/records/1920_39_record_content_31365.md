Burra Town Council, 15 July

Cr Allen reported on the inspection of Johnny Green and said they found it practically scrap iron, full of bullet holes and he thought the Council would be ridiculed if they erected it.

Cr Pearce agreed and thought it would have to be placed 60-80ft up.

The figure was produced and was in a bad way with his pick and gad and an arm broken off, though not lost.  It was resolved to place it in the depot and anyone interested in mending and erecting it be allowed to do so.

The Governor’s Aide-de-Camp writes agreeing to a civic reception on Show Day.

Cr Harris moved to rescind the motion that had resulted in all works going through the Public Works Committee and no works being able to be moved for at the Council table.

Cr Harris thought this resulted in one Councillor only being able to raise matters at a Public Works meeting, the other having no say in the matter.

[Presumably this means only one Councillor from each ward.]
