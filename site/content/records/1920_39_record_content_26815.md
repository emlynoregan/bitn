Obituary.  Miss E. Mary Dodds died at her residence in Kooringa on 1 May and had been a resident of the district for about 16 years.  She was born in South Africa in 1856 and the family came to live in Kensington SA when she was a young woman.  About 16 years ago she and her eldest sister came to keep house for Mr Frank Treloar Jnr at Mongolata Station and when he enlisted for active service they came to Kooringa to live.  She is survived by one sister, Miss Margaret Dodds, who is leaving Kooringa this week to reside for some time with Mr & Mrs Treloar of Toorak Gardens.

[Emily Mary Dodds.]
