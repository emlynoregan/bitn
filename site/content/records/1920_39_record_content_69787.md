Empire Rifle Matches in Sydney

H.H. Byles did very well in the ‘Kings’ Prize.  On the first range he was only 3 points behind the leader and after the second range he was in 5th place with others, only 2 points behind the leader.  In the third stage he and many another shooter suffered from the tension and Buttworth of Queensland finally won.  Burra’s representatives got their names in several prize lists despite their being over 1,400 competitors in all.
