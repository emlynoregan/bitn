Burra District LCL held its AGM in the RSL Hall 23 September.  Elected: President, A.D. Radford and Secretary, John Warnes.  G. Stanley Hawker gave an interesting address and outlined the proposed electoral boundary.

Silver Spur Social Club held its AGM and decided on fortnightly meetings on Tuesday nights from 11 October.  Elected President, R. Bevan; Vice Presidents, P. Murphy & S. Scroop; Secretary, Miss C. Ellis and Treasurer, Mrs F. Scroop.

Grasshopper hatchings are being reported and Mr A.D. Radford says millions of small grasshoppers are on his ‘Glenora’ property.

‘Fed Up Ratepayer’ writes pointing out to Crs Beckwith and Finch that moves to transfer Booborowie and Leighton Wards to Spalding DC were begun by fed-up ratepayers and not by Spalding Council and to accuse the latter of whipping up animosity is completely false.

Must we go on wrecking our cars on ‘our unformed, neglected, pot-holed tracks’ just so the Burra Burra DC will not be unbalanced, he asks.

He also says it is useless to blame the wet winter, as they have put up with the same bad roads for many winter, both wet and dry.

Avis Stockman has now won the Australia-wide ABC broadcasting competition for girls of Rural Youth and Young Farmer Clubs at the Royal Melbourne Show. This seems to be the first time that a South Australian has been the winner.  The first prize was a Phillips Mantle Radio.  While staying in Melbourne contestants were guests of the ABC at the Victorian Private Hotel and were chaperoned by Mrs W. Simpson.  There were several visits to the show and to films as well as to the Town Hall, the Olympic Games site and the Melbourne Botanic Gardens.

Burra Hospital Drive will benefit from the Kapunda Group’s production in the Burra Town Hall on 14 October of Kenneth Horne’s comedy Fools Rush In.  Mr Horne is the well-known BBC producer of Much Binding in the Marsh and other programs.
