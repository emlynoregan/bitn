SAMA¸ 45th Annual Report

Since the last meeting the Association’s agents in London entered into an agreement to sell the mine for £70,000 along with the mineral rights in the Burra Survey and a further 1,783 acres elsewhere, but the purchasers are now declining to fulfil the contract.  The directors are seeking to compel the completion of the purchase.

Tributers working above water level have raised 114 tons on ore in the last 6 months.  64 tons averaged 24¼% and c. 50 tons averaged 26%.  In the last half year outgoings were £441-10-7 and income £1,233-4-7 which increased the credit balance to £15,437-0-7.
