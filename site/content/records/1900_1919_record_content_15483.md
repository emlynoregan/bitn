Broken Hill Notes tell of high temperatures of 100°F to 102°F and an obituary for a Mr Burgess who fell 300ft in the Central mine on Friday.  [It was a bad year for mine accidents in Broken Hill.]

Former Burraite Mr George Strachan was running an electric light plant in Broken Hill, but it seems to have been unreliable and the City Council was considering taking it over.

Tom Nicholls, another old Burraite, played in the City Band that had won the brass band competition recently in Broken Hill.

John Drew, uncle of the Burra Mayor (John Drew), is very ill with diabetes at Menindie.  He left Burra 23 years ago.

Rev. Father Redden has been seriously ill with pleurisy.

Mrs John Morgan is critically ill with cancer in Burra Hospital.

Alf Collins of Mt Bryan has sold his farm to Dick Webber and will move to a property in NSW.
