Letter.  Doug Holly of Berri writes a long letter challenging assertions that galahs kill trees.  Galahs and corellas have been chewing trees for millions of years and yet the trees survive.  Pruning generally invigorates trees and shrubs.  Is it not rather that the trees were already stressed or dying because of the state of the water table quality or town water run-off?  He says there is no justification for the culling of these birds.
