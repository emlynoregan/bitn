Eastern Districts Soil Conservation Board

Report on the recent Collinsville Field Day.

Discussions included:

Onion wed control

Grazing management

Land rehabilitation and revegetation

There were workshops and demonstrations.

Ray O’Malley of Mallee Treeplanting Services of Karoonda, spoke on the use of seedlings to stabilise planned and prepared sites quickly, with their ability to compete with weeds.

Dudley Cockington spoke of the decline in Blackoak and Sugarwood species due to slow regeneration.  Here management of total grazing by sheep, cattle, goats, kangaroos and rabbits was the key issue.

Establishing watering points away from permanent water to allow stock to spread out, but without increasing overall stocking rates would enable young plants to survive.  Other ideas were to improve sheep productivity to allow a reduction in stocking rates for the same return.  [Other ideas are reported.]

The Natural Heritage Trust will be asked for further funding to revegetate the Hallett-Terowie rail corridor.  7½ km of direct seeding was done last week.
