Mr Winnall said he was a candidate for Mayor, but felt it was not going to be a very enviable position.  He would be the first Burra boy to fill the position.  The Waterworks would be the greatest trouble in the year.  He was willing to let the Government take over at once if necessary.  It was too much to expect that they would pay more for their water under the Government that they do now.  People in Adelaide paid 6d per 1,000 gallons while here it was much more.  They paid 3½% interest and we pay 5-6%.  The Burra Waterworks were worth about £3,000 and yet we pay interest on £8,000.  If they are not handed back to the Government we must insist on a substantial reduction in the capital account.  When some time ago the Government valuer placed a price on the works the Government would not part with them for that value.  The slaughterhouse question would also occupy much time of the incoming Council.
