Burra’s Early Days by Frank Treloar

In 1845 copper was discovered, but it took some time for the investors to raise the money required for the Burra Special Survey.  The land grant was issued to William Allen and Samuel Stock Jnr.  With bullock drays as the only means of transport there were many obstacles to be overcome.  On arrival the miners made their homes in the banks of the creek.  At first the ore was sent to Pt Adelaide by bullock dray – loose because there were no ore bags.  It created excitement in England because of its richness.  In July of 1848 a Mr Gregory Seal Walters arrived from England representing the Patent Copper Co. formed to acquire the ore from SAMA’s mine and either send it home in bulk or smelt it as they considered best.  Having set up an office in Adelaide in September 1848 he hastened to Burra where he arranged to assay all ore and on that basis the ore should pass into the possession of the Patent Copper Co. for cash, which gave SAMA the capital for rigorous development.  After another visit to Burra Mr Walters went to Port Wakefield to establish that as the port for exporting the ore and after that the bullock teams took their ore to the head of the gulf.  This led to the blazing of the Gulf Road, along which bad creek crossings had to be eased by the company’s efforts and a bridge was built at Dunn’s which lasted till it was burnt down a few years ago.  It went through Mintaro, Auburn, Skilly and Dunn’s to Pt Wakefield.  Hundreds of teams were employed.  On 30 June 1851 Mr Walters was in Clare for the first elections in SA for the Legislative Council when Mr Younghusband was returned, and for Burra Mr G.S. Kingston was returned.  In July 1851 Mr Ewbanks succeeded Mr Walters to be followed in turn, I believe, by Mr Williams.
