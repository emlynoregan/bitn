A.H. Forder was presented with an illuminated address and a purse of sovereigns at the Council chamber on Friday last.  The Mayor, J. Sampson jun. presided.  Mr Forder was Clerk of the Local Court at Redruth for many years.  The Mayor said he had been associated with him for 24 years and found him a gentleman of the highest order, always obliging and kind.  Mr Forder has resigned and intends to leave the district.

[The address is then printed.]

Hon. J. Lewis MLC said Forder had filled the clerkship for 40 years, was returning officer for 38 years and in that time not a single complaint had been lodged against him.  He had always interested himself in the young – given good advice and taught them music and assisted in his own church.

Others to speak were P. Lane JP, W. West JP, E.C. Lockyer JP, T.W. Wilkinson JP, A. Harris JP, Thomas Sandland JP, J.M. McBride JP, D.J. O’Leary JP, and J.E.H. Winnall JP.  Mr Forder replied and related several funny incidents from his career.
