Letter from George W. Thomson to his parents, dated 10 Nov. on SS. Ascanius.  It was sweltering hot on guard duty with men lying on decks and hatches like sheep.  You have probably heard by now of the crippling of the Emden so that it had to be beached on one of the Cocos Islands after an engagement with the Sydney.  We got a pint of free beer in the afternoon.  The 10th Battalion are holding sports today, but the weather has destroyed most interest.  Rank and file were excluded from the deck and on hearing that several companies withdrew until the order was cancelled.
