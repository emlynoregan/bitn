Accidents.

Last week horses with a van carrying sewing machines bolted, starting near the hospital they went along Commercial St, Kingston St, Welsh Place, Quarry St, Welsh Place (around four awkward corners) then around again.  This time at the Kooringa Hotel they hung the van on a gum tree and continued without it ending up by themselves on Limestone Hill.  Three sewing machines were broken and the van considerably damaged.

Also last week one of the two horses attached to a vehicle gave a display of high kicking causing the driver to make a fast exit.  The horses soon came to a halt against a tree.

On Saturday horses attached to a buggy at the railway goods-shed bolted along the line and cleared the ash-pit.  There the vehicle stayed while the horses continued to the fence.  The only damage was to the swingle-tree and to the harness.
