Aberdeen Ballast Quarry.

The Engineer-in-Chief, Mr Montcriff, visited Burra on Wednesday and with the Mayor, Cr West and Town Clerk W. Davey inspected the ballast quarry.  There is a proposal to lay a siding to the quarry â€“ a distance of c. 1 mile, and when completed two trains a day will run to and from the quarry for ballast.  The ballast here is said to be the best that can be had and is said 40-50 men will be employed.
