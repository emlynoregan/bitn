Inquest/Obituary

An inquest was held on 10 November by J.D. Cave JP at the Smelters’ Home Hotel on the death of Mr Joseph Morris, jeweller, of Adelaide, who had been found suspended by a handkerchief from the top of a bed in the hotel at 1.30 p.m. the same day.

Edward Francis Opie said he had seen deceased at Wildongoleeche 7 p.m. the previous evening in Mr Terry’s Pt Augusta mail coach.  Saw him again at the Smelters’ Arms when he was going to bed.  As I left I asked if he was leaving by the morning train and he said not till the afternoon train.  This morning my brother knocked at his door and at 1.00 p.m. I knocked and asked if he was getting up.  I tried the window, but it was bolted.  There were two policemen in the house and I asked them to break down the door.  Deceased was hanging by the neck from the top of the bedstead.

Mr Nicholas Opie testified to deceased’s arrival at the hotel by Terry’s coach about 10.30 p.m.  He arranged for a bed and then the coach drove on to the Post Office.  Morris returned a quarter of an hour later.  Showed him to his room, where he was talking to my brother when I left.  Knocked on his door for breakfast, but did not see him in the morning.  Knocked again at about 1 p.m. and got no reply.  Tried to look through the keyhole, but the key was in the lock.  Told my brother I thought something was wrong and we agreed to call for the police.  Policeman Farrell broke open the door.  Deceased was sober last night and took no refreshments as far as I know.  Deceased was hanging from the bedstead.  He brought in his luggage and left his boots out to be cleaned.

Constable Farrell said he had seen the deceased outside the hotel the night before.  He told of breaking down the door and discovering the deceased.  Deceased’s feet were about two inches from the ground and his right hand was grasping the headrail of the bedstead.  Left Constable Howard in charge and reported the death to Dr Dashwood who was outside.

Constable Howard gave corroborative evidence and said he had found in deceased’s clothes one £10 note, one £5 note and five £1 notes in his pocket book also 8/4 in coins, keys a memorandum book and two letters.  There was a small bag of rings in his coat pocket and two boxes which Howard had not opened, but assumed contained jewellery.

William E. Dashwood said he had known the deceased for several years and believed him to be of sound health.  He seemed to be of active habits and cheerful.  Last saw him alive 5 November, when he appeared as usual.  There was no appearance of a struggle and from the look of the bed he had not lain down.  From the degree of rigor mortis he appeared to have been dead at least 12 hours.  The cause of death was strangulation from a handkerchief being tied to the top rail of the bedstead with a noose placed around the deceased’s neck.  It was quite possible for the deceased to have tied the noose himself.

Hermann Mosarr, jeweller, residing at Aberdeen said he had known the deceased for two years and had seen him in Aberdeen on Tuesday 3 November.  Morris had told him he had been doing little business and at the time when he should have been doing his best trade, he had been taken ill and had had to spend two weeks in Adelaide.  He was heading north to see if he could do more, having done but little trade in Burra.  He appeared downhearted.  He had said he was going to Laura.  He generally stayed away two or three weeks, but had returned after only a few days.

The coroner remarked that, although in this case it would have made no difference, in general a body should be cut down as soon as possible, as a minute or two can be the difference between life and death.

[This death does not appear in the CD, SA Deaths 1842-1915.  The evidence of the Register 13 November 1874 and of BISA suggests he was Moses Joseph Morris born 1838 in UK and who came to SA with his father Harris Morris in 1853.]
