Mr A.A. Davey was presented with an illuminated address on Monday evening by the Burra Institute Committee in recognition of his long service as librarian.  Only 11 years after the foundation stone was laid in 1874 Mr William Davey became librarian and caretaker.  He held the position until he retired due to ill health in 1903.  13 years before that he took his youngest son, Arthur, who left school at 13, to assist him.  He acted as assistant from 1890 to 1903 and was then appointed to the position he now holds.  In that time the library has been known as one of the best in the state.  The public and private reading rooms are unequalled in the country.  Mr Davey has now had 50 years of direct connection with the Institute.  The text of the address is printed.  The Mayor added his congratulations to those of the committee.  Mr Davey talked of some of the changed he had seen at the library.  He said there had been at least six major changes.  Books were catalogued for the first time 12 months before his father’s death.  The main hall had been changed and the gallery put in.  These changes did away with the smoke and amusement room.  The old amusement room was adjacent to the library on the western side and was used for chess.  It was now the spacious members’ room.  He hoped to continue his duties for some time yet.
