Burra Town Council

A letter from the Engineer in Chief’s Department said that if the Council wanted an expert to look at the Waterworks engines etc. they would have to pay all expenses.

Cr Harris thought it could stand over as it was so near the year’s end.

The Mayor indicated he would not seek re-election.

Tenders were received for two culverts on the main road: £8-10-0 for one near Mr Harvey’s and £8-18-0 for one near St Mary’s.

£200 is still owed on water rates.

The Court of Appeals on the assessment was fixed for 26 November.

The engineer’s report was received.
