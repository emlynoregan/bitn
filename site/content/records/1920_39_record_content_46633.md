Mr & Mrs Charles J. Pearce celebrated their golden wedding 28 June.  All surviving members of the family gathered to congratulate them and were entertained in the evening at the Kooringa Methodist Hall with a high tea for about 50 people.  A three-tiered wedding cake was made for the occasion by Nancy Pearce, their eldest granddaughter who is fourteen.  Special congratulations came from the Mayor and Mayoress and the local Rechabite Lodge of which Mr Pearce has been secretary for over 50 years, and from the CWA.  Mr Pearce is the only surviving member of the William (tailor) Pearce family.  His late brother (Harry) was represented by three grandchildren, Messrs A. & D. Dane and Miss M. Dane.

Mr Pearce was born near Kooringa as the youngest son of W. Pearce who arrived in Burra in 1847.  After leaving school he was apprenticed to W.L.H. Bruse, cabinetmaker with whom he worked for 15 years.  At the age of 27 he started business on his own, which he continues today in conjunction with his eldest son Lisle.  His wife, Miss Agnes Thomas came to Kooringa as a milliner to Messrs Drew & Co.  She was the second daughter of Andrew Thomas FCS of Adelaide and they married 28 June 1883.  Of ten children (five boys and five girls) two boys had died, Colin and Courtney and one girl, Leah, Mrs James.

Surviving are: Evelyn Mrs P.W. Flint (Kingston), Miss Annie (at home in Kooringa), Lisle (managing the Kooringa business), Nita Mrs T. Haworth (Grange), Sister Millicent A. (Matron Kent Town Private Hospital), Andrew (Victoria) and Max (Manager of Elder, Smith & Co. in Kooringa).
