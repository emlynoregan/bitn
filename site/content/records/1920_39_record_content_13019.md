Opening of Burra Electric Supply Co.

It is 11 years since a lighting scheme was first mooted by Mr Crewes.  He has since submitted one scheme after another to Council and all were turned down.  He then got Council permission for a private company and to the surprise of many it has proved successful.

For many years acetylene gas lamps have been sparsely spread around town and their intermittent lights gave as much annoyance as they did help.  The interest in the new plant was widespread and a continuous stream of people visited it when it was opened on Friday night.  The company has the most up-to-date country plant in Australia.  By 7.30 a huge crowd had collected outside to see Mr J.H. Gallagher perform the opening with Mr E.W. Crewes, Chairman of Directors and Messrs J. Reed, W.H. Sandland, directors, with the Mayor, Maurice Collins and the Mayoress and Mrs W.H. Sandland.  Mr Crewes called it a red-letter day for Burra and visitors would no longer pass remarks on the poorly lighted town.  Proceedings then adjourned to the Institute.  Kooringa appeared a mass of twinkling lights and the Institute itself was ablaze of tiny red white and blue lights twinkling from all parts.

The specially lit hall was the scene for light refreshments catered for by J. Allen.  A speech then followed from Mr Gallagher who introduced the Mayor, Mr Collins, who outlined how Mr Crewes had tried to benefit ratepayers and had five or six schemes rejected.  He felt it a pity that the profits now would go to a few shareholders, rather than to the ratepayers.

Then followed a duet by Messrs Glenister and Dollman. [And further items were interspersed between the other speeches]  Mr Woolcott of the Southern Electric Power Co., contractors for the plant, then spoke about the All-British-made plant.  It was of 200 volts as in Adelaide and the population would be able to have the same sort of household helps as in the city, as well as electric light.  Mr Murray, also for the contractors, spoke praising Mr Marr, the consulting engineer.  They had a 60 and 30 horsepower engine which could be run together as 90 horsepower.  Cheap European machinery, for half the price could have been obtained, but they had decided to stick with British manufacture.  The engines worked on crude oil (from which kerosene had been extracted) - a very cheap product.  The plant was far in excess of demand, but experience showed that consumption increased enormously over time.  It was capable of generating 60,000 candlepower and was manufactures by Vickers-Peters at Ipswich - the largest manufacturers of crude oil engines.  Similar engines were used at Crystal Brook and Snowtown.  Dr Steele spoke in congratulating the Co. (though not as a shareholder).  Considering the adverse financial reports of other schemes in SA the promoters were clearly actuated by a desire to benefit the town, rather than the hope for business profits.

Cr Riggs also spoke, saying how good it would be for the Council which had experienced difficulty in getting a lamplighter and thought the site chosen, midway between the two ends of town was a wise choice.  Edgar Pearce spoke as contractor for the carpentering work - he had never believed that Council could run such a scheme as well as private enterprise.
