Children’s Playground.  The committee met at the site on Saturday afternoon.  It was resolved it would be called ‘The Burra Children’s Playground’.  Also it was decided that a rotunda or bandstand would be erected for bands, Continentals and Fetes.  The ground is being laid out now and a busy bee is called for next Saturday with the aim of opening in the third week in December.
