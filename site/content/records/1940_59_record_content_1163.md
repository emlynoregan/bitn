Visit to Sturt Vale

Messrs I.J. Warnes & Sons invited visitors to Sturt Vale to see the shearing and preparation of the wool clip, as they have done for the last eight years.  The trip took place on 8 April.  Classing is done by the advanced students of the South Australian School of Mines.  This year about 50 gentlemen took the trip.  Monday was a perfect day for the journey and Mr Warnes and sons Rex and Jim welcomed the visitors at about 10.30 a.m.  They inspected the shearing shed briefly, before morning tea.  Then they all piled into the cars again for a trip to see the lucerne.  On the last two occasions this had been waving green about 3 feet six inches high, but the drought this year presented dry stalks, though still alive and ready to burst into growth, should the rains arrive.  Mr Warnes planted the lucerne four years ago and now has some 2,500 acres under lucerne.  This year saw no flood for the past fourteen months and 2,500 ewes had been on 1,000 acres of lucerne from October to January.  When they were removed the lucerne sticks again shot out again.  Mr Warnes also has cattle and pigs on the area.   All sheep, cattle and pigs destined for the butchers are topped off with grain feeding for 14 days to render them ready.  Electrified wire fencing is employed.  A trip was then made to the weir that holds back flood waters and has enabled the growth of thousands of acres of lucerne.  Half the visitors got lost on the way back to the homestead, and were delayed about half an hour.  Lunch was then served.

Mr Codrington, SA Wool Instructor gave a talk on the appraisement system and other matters relating to wool, which had to be taken into consideration by growers under that system.  [Reported at some length.]

The visitors then adjourned to watch the shearing and the classing of the wool.  Much interest was taken in the loading of the large semi-trailers, two of which transport the wool, carrying 42 bales each, direct to Port Adelaide.  They make the trip down one day and back the next, mostly with heavy back loading.  The shed was busy with 20 shearers on the board.  Mr Warnes said they employed 42 hands for the shed only, with musterers etc. extra to that number and they expected to shear 40,000 sheep this year.  Mr Codrington had been supervising the preparation of the clip at Sturt Vale and Koomooloo for the past 21 years.  Afternoon tea was served at 4.30 p.m., after which the visitors returned to their homes.
