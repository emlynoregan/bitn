Resident Magistrate’s Court, Kooringa, 25 March.

Joseph Worth was charged with robbing John Folds. [At the later trial cited as John Foulds.]

William Bailey, general servant at the Smelters’ Home Hotel saw the prisoner drinking in the bar of the Smelters’ Home on Friday evening with the witness Tighe and the complainant.  [At the trial Bailey is cited as Bayley.]

Sergeant John Reid said Tighe had come to the police station on Friday and reported that Worth had robbed Folds.  Tighe’s face was much cut.  He delivered up money orders amounting to £17-13-2, which he said he had taken from his pocket for safety.  Reid went and arrested the prisoner who had what appeared to be recently washed cuts on his forehead.

Archibald Kirk was sitting in his hut on the banks of the creek on Friday night and said he saw the prisoner and the witness Tighe struggling together.  Heard Tighe say the prisoner had been robbing him.  Prisoner ran away, leaving his hat behind.  The charge was denied.  Worth was committed for trial.

Jane Hall alleged that Cherry Stevens had used abusive language towards her and called her a thief.  The parties are neighbours in the creek.  Stevens keeps chickens and having lost some eggs, he went to Hall and kicked up a row.  The magistrate said the proper course would have been to apply to the court; he told Stevens that he had no right to go to Hall’s house and make a row.  The defendant having apologised to Mrs Hall, the information was allowed to be withdrawn.

27 March.

Thomas Miller appeared to substantiate his right to a bullock claimed by Albert Meurant.  It appeared that about a year ago Meurant bought the bullock and soon after lost it.  A few days ago he saw the bullock in Miller’s team.  Miller proved he bought the bullock from J.F. Angas at Flaxman Valley at about the time Meurant lost it.  His Worship ordered the bullock be returned to Meurant.
