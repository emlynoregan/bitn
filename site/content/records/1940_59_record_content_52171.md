Exhibition of Arts, Crafts & Antiques was held at Burra RSL Hall on Thursday as part of Jubilee celebrations.  It was a remarkable and delightful event.  Paintings served as a background to silverware dating back to the seventeenth century.  [A number of the exhibits are listed in a report extending for one column.]
