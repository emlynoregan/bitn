The Burra Hospital

Last Tuesday Country Health SA Yorke & Lower North Services Director Gary Stewart met with concerned residents over the issue of having a resident doctor in Burra to attend emergencies.  Helen Szuty said they had heard that Dr Dharma Dissanayakeâ€™s appeal about the current arrangements had been heard, but the results had not been made known.  Mr Stewart reassured the group that in the meantime critically ill patients will be attended to by ambulance officers and/or triage registered nurses available all the time and doctors based in Clare would immediately be called in.  Ms Szuty said that while the ongoing processes seem to have been fair to the doctor concerned, the length of the process has meant that Burra and District have not had the benefit of the usual and expected level of emergency services.
