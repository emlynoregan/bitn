‘Padding’: the paper contained a great deal of material that was neither local nor news.  All of pages 3 and 4 in this issue are such.  The following are examples of the sort of article which I may in future issues refer to as ‘padding’.

Who is it that wants war?

Midnight rainbows

Songs that made Scotland

England to Australia in 60 hours

Mineral production in SA 1841-1931

A lucky accident (Stearic Acid)

Too much foot for a shoe

Neighbours not wanted

Carelessness causes most motor accidents

The Milky Way

Italian tomb unearthed

Not a special racing oil

Are children greedy?

Why England needs a Mussolini
