Burra Town Council, 20 September

Burra Motor Co. was given permission to erect another bowser.

T.H. Woollacott was given permission to erect a supper room at the Institute and also to erect a house for Messrs R. Reed & Son.

Two more pines have been pulled up by boys.

Discussion on weighbridges and their accuracy continued.

Cr Riggs said there should be a re-arrangement of Wards.  West Ward was compact and full of rateable properties.  East and North Wards were scattered with long lengths of road to maintain.  North Ward had approach roads and East Ward had the Cemetery Rd.

The Town Clerk said a change needed a petition from one fifth of ratepayers.

Cr Riggs & Cr Woollacott are to represent the Council on the committee to improve Market Square.

Cr Allen reported ‘some disgusting practises’ in the shelter-shed on the Aberdeen-Kooringa road.  The police have been informed.
