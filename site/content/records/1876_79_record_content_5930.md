A Masonic Farewell was given to Thomas Bath who leaves soon on a trip to England. Mr Bath in responding to best wishes recalled joining the lodge in Kooringa 29 years before and in 1852 so many went to the gold rushes that there was not a quorum for meetings. Songs and recitations were given by members. E. Lipsett `rendered The Charge of the Light Brigade in a capital manner.'

Mr Bath's Banquet in the Institute on 18 Feb. was chaired by Mr Rees MP. After the meal there were the usual speeches and toasts.

P. Lane toasted Parliament and made a political speech.

Mr Rees responded at some length with another. The toast of the evening then followed and the chairman handed Mr Bath a beautifully illuminated address done by W.G.P. Joyner.

Mr Bath responded, saying he had arrived in the colony as a Govt. immigrant 32 years before with £15. His schooling had not cost more than £2, having never been paid for at more than 2d a week. His first job in Adelaide was as a printer's devil and he accumulated £40. He then walked to Burra and set up business and in less than three years was doing business to the amount of £30,000 p.a. when suddenly the Victorian gold rush caused a plunge when he had liabilities of £10,000, but he managed to pull through and had paid everyone 20/- in the £. Despite the depression in mining there had been fewer failures at Burra than in any other town in proportion to population.

Mr Rosman proposed the `Combined interests of SA.'

Mr E. Lipsett responded for the commercial interests.

Mr Escott responded for farmers.

Mr H. Dawson proposed the `Town and Trade of Burra.'

Dr Nesbitt, Mayor and vice-chairman, responded.

Mr Ridgway gave `The Press.'

Press representatives for the Register, Advertiser and Burra Record responded.
