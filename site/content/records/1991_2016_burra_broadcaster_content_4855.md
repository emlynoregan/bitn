Burra Hospital

Acting Hospital Board Chairperson Colleen Woodgate said a Service agreement between the Hospital and the Health Commission , due to be signed on 14 October, has not been signed and many letters seeking clarification have not been answered.  The Hospital is seeking clarification on the allocated bed numbers and the ratio of private and public bed numbers.

The 1990 agreement allocated the 30 beds as 10 acute and 20 long stay nursing home type.  At present there are 17 long stays in residence.

Funding has been allocated for 9 long stays and the resulting shortfall in funds would make running the Hospital quite difficult.  Advice on Friday was that sections of the agreement were being redrafted.  Mr Kerin MP has been advised that nursing home bed days have been marginally reduced as more nursing homes were being built.  Burraâ€™s doubling of long term patients in recent months has gone against this trend.
