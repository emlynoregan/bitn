Accident.  A car, apparently travelling at considerable speed struck a post on the northwest end of the approach to the Bon Accord Bridge on Sunday evening.  The post, about 3’ in diameter and embedded in the ground 3’6” was hurled aside and two more posts and a couple of rails were taken out and the car landed right-side up on the bank.  Amazingly only one man needed a few stitches in his head.  The car was destroyed.  [Check the 3’ diameter post! Perhaps 3”?]
