Burra Red Cross, Half-Yearly Meeting.

Mrs C.J. Pearce reported.  We regret the departure of Mrs Harcus, the late secretary who left the district.  The half-year has been rather quiet as far as making garments.  There are lots of goods on hand, but a glut on the market and no shipping facilities.  A spinning display raised over £14 on 17 July.  On 26 July the Red Cross helped the Cheer-up Society on Violet Day.  We also participated in Australia Day.  The buttons we sold raised c. £120.

The Children’s Fancy Dress Carnival was a success and raised £25.  We assisted other patriotic societies on Navy Day.
