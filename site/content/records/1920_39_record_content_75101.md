Obituary.  Clement William Pearce aged 53, husband of Winifred Pearce, died at Burra Hospital 27 May.  He was the father of Harold, Dorothy, Frank, Roy & Mary.  He had suffered from a strained back for three or four years which forced him to give up rifle shooting and other interests and more recently had stomach troubles and colitis set in some weeks ago.  He was the 5th son of the late Mr & Mrs John Pearce and was born 17 August 1885 at Kooringa and educated at Burra Public School after which he joined his father in the building and contracting business.  Of recent years he has worked with his eldest surviving brother, Edgar.  As a younger man he was a prominent footballer for Ramblers and later Kooringa.  He also played tennis, but rifle shooting was his preferred sport and he had filled all offices of the Burra Club except that of treasurer, which his brother Edgar has held for many years.  He was closely associated with the Kooringa Methodist Church and Sunday School of which he was a teacher and Superintendent in conjunction with Mr John Drew.  He was a trustee of the church and a circuit steward.  He married in August 1913 Miss Winifred I. Jones, daughter of the late Mr & Mrs A. Jones of Unley and there was a family of five children.  At the largely attended funeral twenty-two members of the Rifle Club formed a guard of honour at the house and six members acted as bearers.  At the cemetery senior scholars of the Sunday school formed a guard of honour with their teachers.  He is survived by four brothers: Edgar, Alfred, Norman and Os.  There are also two surviving sisters: Miss Gertrude and Mrs A.S. Dearlove (Nell) of Ketchowla.
