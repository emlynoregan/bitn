AdChem

There is presently a glut of copper oxide on the world market and as a result the Burra operation will shed about eight jobs.  The board has asked for charges to effect a saving of $1 million.  The idea is to ensure the long term viability of the Burra plant.  Cuts will affect both award based and staff positions.  Production for the year will be around 15% below the previous year’s output.  Since the suspension of concentrate treatment the company’s priority has been to obtain a lower cost source of raw materials.  This has proved difficult and so other costs must be cut.  From next month the operation of the cupric oxide plant will return to a 19 day shift cycle, reducing the shift teams from four to three.  One person will also be cut from each shift team.  A further cut of one person from the day shift relief team and from maintenance will also be needed.
