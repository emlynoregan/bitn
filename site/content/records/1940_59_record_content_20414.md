Soil Erosion

An article a couple of weeks previously on the clearance of mallee and the resulting erosion cited the Baldina/Mongolata area as a local example.  This provoked a response by Mr Oates of Poonunda, disagreeing with the example.  In this issue there are two long letters from James H. Schwier (one received too late for the previous issue) that take detailed exception to Mr Oates’ assertions, with some detailed evidence to back up the writer’s views.
