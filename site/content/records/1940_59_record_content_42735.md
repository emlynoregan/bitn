Burra Rifle Club went to the Dean Range on Saturday to shoot against the Metropolitan Team.  Unfortunately heavy rain in Burra tricked one of the arranged drivers into concluding the match was off and he failed to pick up his carload of shooters.  It was quite dry in Adelaide where the depleted Burra team scored 678 to Metropolitan 724.
