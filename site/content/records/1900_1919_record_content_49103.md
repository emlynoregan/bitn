Numbering of issues in 1916

The practice of beginning a new volume each year failed.

The year began with Volume XXII Number 1980 on 5 January 1916.

But the very next issue saw a change to Volume XXXIII Number 1981 12 January 1916.

This continued to Volume XXXIII Number 1997 3 May 1916.

For no apparent reason there was then a change to:

Volume XXXVIII Number 19 10 May 1916

And continued to Volume XXXVIII Number 51 on 20 December 1916.

Literary Supplements 19161

1 Only a few of the supplement for 1916 are preserved and most of those only in the hard copy.

2 The dates for these supplements are unclear because the bound hard copies and the microfilm disagree.  The problem stems from the first of those above which is dated 29 December 1915, but no paper was issued on that date.  It is omitted from the microfilm, but bound with 5 January issue in hard copy.
