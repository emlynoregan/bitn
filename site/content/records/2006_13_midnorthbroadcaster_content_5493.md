Haseley Stud, based at Toodyay, WA, has recently acquired Redcliffe and Pine Valley Stations.  The stud is a leading breeder of White Dorpers and has plans to run up to 14,000 breeding ewes on the properties.  They believe they can replicate their success in WA.  The Dorper has the ability to thrive in pastoral country.  They can produce three lambs in two years.  The ewes can mate at nine months and wean lambs at fourteen weeks.
