Obituary.  Mr Richard Collins, a former resident of this district, died at Strathalbyn on 18 March.  He was born in Burra on 25 October 1863 and was educated at Stanley Grammar school, Watervale.  The late C. Bartholomaeus and Mr Isaac Killicoat who still survives were the only other Burra boys to attend this school.  Mr Collins later took up land at Mongolata and Mt Bryan and followed pastoral and farming pursuits.  He married Miss Emily Hine of Gawler.  There were three children: Mr E.C. Collins of Mt Bryan, Mr H.R. Collins of Spalding and Mrs Evans of Pt Augusta.  His first wife predeceased him and he later married Miss Rosa Symons, who survives him.  In 1897 he became Clerk for the old Mt Bryan District Council, a position he held for 35 years, during which time he was also Clerk of the Hallett District Council for 25 years.  He took a keen interest in district affairs and was a JP.  In 1922 he retired to Brighton, later moving to Strathalbyn, where he lived until his death.
