G. Tennant responds to ‘Thoughtful’ saying that though the Queen competitions or baby competitions raise money well, the jealousies are an undesirable strain, if only temporary.  They involve a series of entertainments which are increasingly difficult for housewives, especially as they are already maintaining a Red Cross/FFCF shop and the pie cart on sale days.  She likes the idea of small committee, but would prefer one big gala day rather than having it spread over three months and would supplement the takings with an appeal for direct giving which avoids a huge amount of work that generally falls on the same few.
