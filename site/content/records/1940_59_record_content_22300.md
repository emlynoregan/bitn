The novel entertainment included a number of musical performances, a sketch and a ballet.  The big piece of the evening was ‘Toreador’ involving splendid singing by Mr L.H. Thomas accompanied by Mrs Thomas, the ballet and the entrance of Signor Martino attired as the Toreador and then the ferocious ‘Ferdinand the Bull’ with Jim Auld and Ron Pascoe inside.  The bull fight took place on the stage.  Supper was served cafeteria style with choices from a ‘sav and roll’ for 6d down to cake for 2d.
