BCS has a new shearing shed.  Having acquired Brewery Hill in 1997, the school flock was expanded to 150 ewes.  Shearing has been done in the corner of the main shed for years, but the increase in the flock has led to a new shed being erected.  The shed in part used money previously allocated for a toilet on Brewery Hill and incorporates a wheelchair accessible toilet.  Other funds came from enterprises on Brewery Hill.  Redden Bros won the contract.  Alan Jacka and David Nourse built and plumbed the toilet respectively.  The shed was first used for shearing on 24 September.  An official opening is planned for early November.  [2 photos.]
