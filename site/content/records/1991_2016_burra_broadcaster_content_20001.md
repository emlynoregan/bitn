Royal Adelaide Show

Burra Community School had success with its Led Steer Team this year, gaining five ribbons from the three animals.  On the hoof they gained a 2nd with ‘Butch’, a Red Poll’ and a 5th with ‘Nemesis’ a South Devon.  On the hook they gained Reserve Champion EU carcass with ‘Nemesis’, 2nd Schools EU steers (again with ‘Nemesis’) and 4th Schools Trade steers with ‘Brutus’ their Red Angus.  Having spent a lot of time preparing these animals, the students were well rewarded.
