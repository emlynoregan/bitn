Elder, Smith & Co.  We have seen plans for the new building in Market Square.  It is a two storey building with a ground floor main office and managerâ€™s room and upstairs sitting, bed and bath rooms.  Private tenders have been called among local tradesmen with a view to keeping the work in the town.
