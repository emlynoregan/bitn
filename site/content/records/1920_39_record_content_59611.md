‘Anne Ratepayer’ writes to complain of the injustice inflicted on those in the Hundred of Anne due to the amalgamation of Councils.  Despite their having been the ratepayers that contributed to the purchase of the equipment, it was ruled that all the Council Equipment would go to the Burra Burra DC when most of the Booborowie Council was amalgamated with Burra DC.  Now the Hallett DC had to buy the equipment sitting in Anne Ward when by right it already belonged to them.  [The argument goes on for about ½ column.]
