Cr Marston raised the question of the Red Cross shop, which was hitting people in business quite hard.

The Mayor said he could not stop the Red Cross from selling articles in a shop.

The Mayor said there was too much overlapping of patriotic efforts and Cr Lee agreed.

Lloyd Parks was given permission to rake up all carob beans under Council trees.  He was forwarding them to Sydney where they were being treated for war work.

Cr Bevan complained that a notice in Warner’s Café more or less implied that the only place to get a cup of tea in town was the Red Cross Shop.  If this continued there would be more empty shops in Burra.  The Red Cross Shop only operated on Fridays and on other days people would pass under the impression it was impossible to get a light snack in Burra.

It was decided to try to get the notice removed.
