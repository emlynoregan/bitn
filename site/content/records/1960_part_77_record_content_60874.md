Burra District Sports Grounds

This property was recently handed over to the Burra Burra DC by the Burra Sports Syndicate and with some other land purchased by the Council provided grounds for the Aberdeen Football Club, Aberdeen Netball Club and the Burra Golf Club.  The Burra Racing Club has closed at least for the time being and the racing stalls and running rails have been removed.  This has made extra space available.  The area under the trees along the creek would make an ideal picnic spot if developed with tables, seats and barbecues.  Social bodies could hire the oval.  The grass courts could be restored to playing condition and could be available for Sunday play.  If these ideas appeal to anyone, now is the time to act.

C.L. Phillips.
