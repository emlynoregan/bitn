Burra Town Council, 4 May

Most of the report concerns a complaint by W.J. Thomas about cutting of weeds.

The school quarry stone, though excellent, is proving difficult to break.  The contractor wanted 10/- a yard and was getting 5/-.  Cr Kellaway moved the cancellation of the contract.  Carried.

It would seem that the alternative decided upon was to use the hospital quarry on day work basis.

Stanley Eig (14) of the local post office did very well in the recent postal exams and was third in Australia in Arithmetic, which is an achievement considering he lived ‘outback’ when young and received only four years schooling.
