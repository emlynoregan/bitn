Kooringa Court, 4 February.

Jessie Margaret Halls was charged on the information of her husband Thomas P. Halls Jnr with the embezzlement of £31-0-6 between 13 December and 30 January 1916.

Thomas P. Halls Jnr charged Hilton Grow with embezzlement of £24-10-0 between 13 December 1915 and 30 January 1916.

Thomas P. Halls Jnr was also charged by his wife with assaulting her on 3 February.

The embezzlement cases were adjourned to 10 February and the assaults to 4 February.

On the resumption of the latter Thomas P. Halls Jnr was charged with assaulting Hilton Grow on 3 February, but counter-charged his own wife and Grow with assaulting him on 3 February.

Halls objected to W. Crewes being on the bench because ‘he Mr Crewes has got his knife into me’ and has had since a municipal election some years ago.  Crewes remained on the bench with T.W. Wilkinson.

Mrs Halls:

Last Thursday Halls told her that Hilton Grow has signed a statement at Halls Senior’s house alleging misconduct between Mrs Halls and Grow.  Mrs Halls had denied it and Halls had struck her each time she had, with a clenched fist and kicked her in the stomach, tipped a water-bag over her to revive her and then struck her again.  Then Grow drove up in a cab and Tom called him in.  Mrs Halls asked Grow about the alleged statement of which he denied all knowledge.  Grow told Halls to stop hitting his wife.  Halls pushed Grow over the back of the chair he was sitting on.  Did not actually see Halls strike Grow as she was escaping at the time.  She denied hitting Tom with a coffee pot or that Grow hit him with a frying pan.  He accused me on Thursday morning of impropriety with Grow.  Grow drove my luggage to my sister’s.  The children (four of them) are with Halls.

Hilton Grow.

Confirmed what had happened up to Mrs Halls’ escape.  He denied signing any statement.  Said Halls had attacked him after Mrs Halls left, but he had got away after a minute or two.  There has been no impropriety.

Thomas Halls Jnr.

Returned home from hospital after recovering from typhoid on Sunday.  He accused his wife of impropriety with Grow, alleging she had been found on the bed together.  She admitted Grow had been on the bed, but she was only tickling him.  Told her he was finished with her.  Noticed her bags were packed and said that looked like guilt.  Repeated the conversation to Grow when he arrived and that was when both of them attacked me – she with a coffee pot and he with a frying pan and fist.  She fell on her head climbing over the wall.  He admitted to striking Grow, but not his wife: pushed her, but never hit her.  I said nothing about a signed statement.  At one point everybody was hitting everybody else.  Untrue I pushed Grow over the chair.  Wife was pretty regular in attendance at hospital while I was there.

Judgements:

T. Halls Jnr v. Jessie M. Halls & T. Halls Jnr v. H. Grow were both dismissed with 5/- costs in each.

Jessie M. Halls v. T. Halls Jnr.  Defendant fined 20/- with £1-1-0 costs + 15/- court fees.

H. Grow v. T. Halls Jnr.  Defendant fined 10/- with £1-1-0 costs + 15/- court fees.
