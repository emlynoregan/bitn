‘Cousin Jack’s’.  There is an article that reads like a paid advertisement for Gary Donaldson’s Fine crafts Gallery, featuring a wide range of quality SA Crafts and especially his own woodcraft.  Located at 20 Market Square [sic: in mistake for Market Street] Burra North, opposite the Ambulance Station.

Birth.  To Jenny & Michael Mengersen, a son, Aaron.  [Mengerson in the paper.]

Burra Burra DC will hold electors’ meetings as follows:

Mt Bryan 8 April

Booborowie 10 April

Farrell Flat 15 April

Burra Civic Centre 17 April

Vandalism has been reported recently at the Redruth Gaol with attempts to jemmy locks and an article was taken from the Breaker Morant display.

The Caring & Sharing Group had 25 at the workshop on drug and alcohol abuse.  Rosemary Opperman will speak on ambulance services at the next meeting.

Burra Burra DC is negotiating a lease on part of the goods shed at the railway station to accommodate the SES and DFS units.

National Trust AGM.  Colin Fidock reported on the restoration of buildings made possible by a combination of voluntary labour and grants.  He spoke particularly of:

The completion and opening of Malowen Lowarth.

Continuing work on Redruth Gaol.

Restoration of the lock-up (at one time threatened with demolition).

From the key hire system $7,835 had been generated and commission from National Trust Tours added $3,322.  O’Connor Tours brought in $4,800 and other fund raising contributed $3,000.  Grants of over $74,000 had passed through the books in 1985.  He estimated operating expenses for 1985 at $20,000.
