Burra Community & Sports Complex.  AGM recently.

President Trevor Wall reported on a generally successful year, but somewhat frustrated at the lack of progress on getting the netball courts upgraded to netball/tennis courts, fenced and lit.  This is however, now under way and should be done by the netball season.  Also about to be done are the speed humps and the dividing of the road behind the complex.
