The Caledonian Pipe Band arrived in the town just before 6 p.m. on Saturday with their manager Mr Andrew Small.  They were met by members of the RSL and taken to the Royal Exchange Hotel for tea.  They later marched to Kooringa where they delighted folk with several numbers before returning to Burra North, where they gave a concert at the Methodist Memorial Hall to a full house.  Interspersed were songs by Mrs Max Pearce, Miss Mavis Fairchild and Mr Guy Dollman.  Mr H. White was accompanist.

Drum Major Tom Caldwell won the VC in France in the Great War.

Burra has a representative in the band in Piper C. Gemmell who was born here and whose people lived in the district for many years.

Mr T.H. Woollacott has signalled his intention of standing again for the position of Mayor.  When many houses in Burra were empty due to the drift to the city, he approached the Government and refilled them with people residing in the city who were not involved in the war effort.  Businessmen in Burra have benefited from the extra trade thus generated.
