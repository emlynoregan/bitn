Burra Bowling Club is proceeding with the development of the new area.  Areas are to be replanted and the new areas have to be ripped up, levelled and then planted.  The old greens are to be lengthened and are being ripped and scarified.  This area is being lowered and the material moved to the new area (formerly part of Bridge Street), which has to be raised and a further 100 cubic yards of filling will be needed.  New turf will be planted in June/July.  A new fence has been erected running east-west and the memorial gates have been erected at the northwest corner.
