Tony Maio, BCS Principal writes re the school formal.  This year the year 12 students decided to replace the formal with a dinner with parents and teachers.  The SRC was informed and have since been working on an alternative ‘formal’ night for the rest of the school.  The intention is to ensure the school community does have an end of year event while recognising the year 12 students’ opinions and wishes.  He concludes by saying that he values the school’s traditions and thanks the community for its concerns and interest.
