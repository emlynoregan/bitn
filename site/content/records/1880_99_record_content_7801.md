The nearest neighbour was Mr Bewley c. ¾ mile away.  I knew he was absent as was my husband.  Mr Tolman’s boy was the first to give help.

Horace E. West - was riding out yesterday when Miss McBride said a little boy had fallen into the dam.  Went there and with a plank got him out and then went to fetch Dr Sangster and Mr Johnson, whom I met going out.  A boy arrived about the same time as I.

Deceased is a son of Mrs Johnson.

Thomas Pearce gave evidence supporting the above, having arrived very soon after Mr West.

The depth of the water was about 2’10”.

Dr Sangster confirmed drowning as the cause of death.

P-C John Worthy Johnson gave evidence and the verdict of the jury was ‘death by falling into a dam and being drowned and not otherwise.’

[Death registeration gives the age as 5 years and the place as Princes Town.  Born 1 April 1878.]
