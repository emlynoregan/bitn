Town Clerk: ‘No – I get £50 or 19/3 a week.

Mr Rabbich: ‘Anyhow he receives £120 for all his work and the Inspector £60.

Town Clerk: ‘I defy anyone to carry out the two positions.  When Mr Holder was Town Clerk the Waterworks were not in existence.  The engineer should be paid £2-10-0 a week not £3.’

A Voice: ‘Give him fair play first.’

Cr Parks, as candidate for East Ward, said he was against the amalgamation of the Town Clerk and Inspector.

Cr West offered himself for re-election with a policy of honesty, straightforwardness and economy and would not interfere in the present arrangement of offices.

Mr Shortridge was again standing as auditor a position he has held for 8-9 years.

Dr Brummitt said he would like to see a pavilion at the oval, but would need to see how it would work first.  He did not think a reduction in rates possible until the whole of the bonds were repaid in 1897.
