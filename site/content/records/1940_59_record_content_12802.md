Last Tuesday Pte Alfred Zerna fell in dashing to get on the 3.13 p.m. train as it pulled out of the station, having collided with the picket fence at the end of the platform.  Carriage wheels passed over both legs severing one and badly crushing the other.  The train stopped immediately and Dr Steven attended within ten minutes.  The injured man was immediately transferred to Burra Hospital where he died at 5 p.m.  The train was delayed about 20 minutes while statements were taken and on the police making a report to the coroner Mr G.E. Dane an inquest was deemed unnecessary.

The deceased was the youngest son of Mr & Mrs E.R. Zerna of Dutton and was born at Frankton 25 October 1921.  He enlisted two years ago and was sent to the far north.  The funeral took place at Burra on Thursday.  Several members of his unit attended: Ptes G. Barclay (Victoria), J.B. Norris & W.A. Jackson (both of Tasmania), H. Dewhirst, F. Burton, T. West & C. Opel (all from SA).  A number of local returned men from the 1st AIF and some 2nd AIF soldiers on leave also attended.  The bearers were Pte Jim Kotz DCM MM, Tom Allen, A.L. Bence, E.C. Collins, M.T. Fuller & K.M. Drew.  Dr Steele represented the RSL.
