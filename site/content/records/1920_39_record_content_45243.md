Mongolata Goldfield

Byles’ GM Co.  At 92ft level the south drive has reached 165ft on a 3ft wide lode.  At 131ft better values began and have improved.  There are very rich seams in the last 7ft.

The crosscut east at 124ft has extended to 40ft with traces of gold in the last 15ft.

At 52ft level the winze was sunk 7’6” to 15’6” on gold-bearing formation and then opened out on the south side and crosscut east 19ft: fine gold found at 11ft.

Developments at the 92ft level are most promising.

First 50 ton 14cwt crushed at the battery yielded 52oz 19dwt 12gr or 10oz 0dwt 20gr per ton which was highly satisfactory.

The mine was open for inspection on 2 March and about 200 people inspected it.

Golden Harp lease.  Shaft now at 16’6” and logged up.  The quartz and iron reef cut out at 13ft.  Will continue sinking to cut veins exposed to the north.
