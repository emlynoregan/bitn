F. Ward of Thebarton seized the opportunity of war to write urging a great religious revival with churches open day and night to 9 p.m. in two shifts.  He wanted to take the opportunity to: abolish horse racing, have real temperance (not abstinence), eliminate theatre and also pugilism.  Nor would he waste tanks of water in baptism, though he was a believer in immersion, he would insist on the use of natural pools etc.
