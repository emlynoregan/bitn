State Election.  Counting of votes from last Saturday has not been completed, but so far it suggests a sweeping Labor victory with a probable majority of 6.  In the early closing referendum 6 o’clock was by far the most popular time.  In the Burra electorate it got 5,137 and the other hours (to 11 p.m.) together got 4,143 of which 3,174 were for 11 p.m.

For the state so far there were:  	87,025 votes for 6 p.m.

64,560 for other hours, of which

52,201 were for 11 p.m.

In the Burra electorate the three Liberal candidates (Pick, Miller & O’Loughlin) were returned with majorities much like the previous election.
