J.F. Hogan writes in criticism of L.J. Kesting’s letter on dances, accusing him of chasing his own tail: of going round in circles to no purpose, but later he descends to personal comment and seems to miss Kesting’s point about the real skills of modern dance.  Hogan also attacks ‘Fox Trot’ and reaffirms his belief that ‘jazz’ dancing will price itself out of existence.  Eventually he probably gets to the heart of the problem when he says ‘I am not opposed to jazz dancing as a pastime . . . but “we old timers” strongly object to the consummate conceit and cheek of the younger generation who stated openly that we had no right to hold a dance without providing some ‘jazz’ dances for them.’

He concludes with what is clearly another source of resentment.  ‘At the last Bachelors’ Ball the only ones attending the tables were elderly ladies, who did not have a dance and further did not attend to have a dance.’

L.J. Kesting submits another long letter, this time turning his focus on ‘Fox Trot’s’ objection to the use of the Bible to support argument in this matter.  But Kesting considers it would be hypocritical to limit the Bible’s use only to Sunday – but his letter is tediously protracted.
