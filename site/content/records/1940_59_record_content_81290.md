Adelaide Wool Sales.  Best district price was 72d by the Estate of the late N.F. McBride ‘Kia-Ora’.

[Other local district prices are printed.]

‘Dunara’ Hallett of 1,156 acres was passed in at auction on 26 March at £12 per acre and we believe it has since been sold to Mr Hugh Kelly of Whyte Yarcowie for an unknown figure.

‘Cartapo’.  Mr R. McInnes has purchased the ‘Homestead’ portion of ‘Cartapo’ from Mr R. Murray and it is believed the remainder has been sold to Mr A.L. Collins.

Mr D.R. McInnes offered 47 acres at Booborowie for sale on 26 March and it was passed in at £101 per acre, but later sold to Mr Angus McInnes, the highest bidder at the auction.
