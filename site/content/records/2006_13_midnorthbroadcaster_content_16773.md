Kate Conners, nee Madigan of Yandama Station near Broken Hill and formerly of Booborowie, will this month lead a presentation at the Leading Ladies Luncheon in Adelaide.  She will speak of her experiences as a grazier and also as the wife of a person with spinal cord injury.  The luncheon will be held at The Highway Hotel, Anzac Highway on Friday 31 May.  Proceeds aid the Paraplegic and Quadriplegic Association of SA.
