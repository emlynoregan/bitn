The Waikerie Band arrived in Burra last Saturday evening.  They were accommodated at various homes.  On Sunday afternoon they gave a combined band performance with the Burra Band at Aberdeen, to a good crowd.  In the evening the united bands gave a concert in Market Square to a large audience, but collections at both concerts were disappointingly small: £1-7-6 at Aberdeen and £3-4-9¼ at Kooringa.  The farthing has been embezzled by Mr Joe Pascoe, who will not part with it!

Band President Mr E.F. Marston stood in for the Mayor in welcoming the band.  His Worship, as the direct representative of HM King George V, whose death had caused such profound grief, was unable to take a prominent part in the proceedings.  Two minutes’ silence was observed in memory of the late king, followed by the National Anthem, to close the proceedings on a solemn note.  The band was then entertained at Mrs Rowe’s café and left on Monday to fulfil an engagement at Cadell.
