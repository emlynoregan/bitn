Burra Jubilee Benevolent Society held its AGM.  Though there had been only one meeting for the year, the society has not been inactive.  We secured a wheelchair and now have two located in the Burra Hospital and available to anyone in the district who may need them (free).  Several families in need have been helped with wood and groceries.  Some clothes and shoes have also been distributed.  Former officers were re-elected: President, Rev. T. Drought; Secretary, Mrs H. Jennison and Treasurer, Mrs F. Atkin.
