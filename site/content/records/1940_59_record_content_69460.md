Burra Jubilee Benevolent Society held its AGM.

The Mayor and Mayoress Mr & Mrs Baulderstone showed great interest in the society during the year.  During the year the Chairman, Rev. C. Christopher, had moved to Pt Pirie.  Rev. D. Haydon has taken his place on the committee.  Lieut. Kirkham of the Salvation Army moved to WA.

One of our loans became due and £200 was converted to a long term, 14-year loan at 4½%.  Wood was delivered in half-ton lots in July and August 1954 and in July 1955.  £1-5-0 grocery orders for Christmas cheer were given to some persons.  In June circulars were sent to persons to let us know that if their circumstances were really bad because our finances were under great strain and we could only supply what was really essential.  Elected: President, Mrs H. Jennison; Secretary, Mrs A.B. Riggs and Treasurer, Mr Reg. Davey.
