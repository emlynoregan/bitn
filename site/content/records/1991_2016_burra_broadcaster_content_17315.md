The Old Mine Store

Conservation work is currently being carried out at the old Mine Store – John Carpenter’s property.  A conservation study was done on the store and yard, built in 1847, a couple of years ago, with funds from the National Estate Program.  Conservation work was then earmarked as urgent and a second grant is now seeing this done.  The building once housed offices, stores and a storeman’s residence and had an adjoining spacious yard surrounded by a high wall.  It was a depot for building materials, iron, tools and mining machinery of the SAMA.  Along with the powder magazine, it is believed to be the oldest remaining mine building in Australia.
