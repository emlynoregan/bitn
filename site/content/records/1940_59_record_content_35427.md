Sunday Sport

After its meeting on 16 February the Town Council informed the Aberdeen Tennis Club that it could find no agreement of lease containing a clause debarring the Club from playing tennis on Sundays and the Burra Town Council By-Laws do not contain a By-Law prohibiting Sunday Sport.  The Club said it intended to spend £150 on improvements and unless it could be assured that members had the right to play on a Sunday the money would possibly be spent elsewhere.  Many members would resign and the Club would deteriorate.

The Mayor (H.J.B. Jennison) said he would refuse to take a motion on Sunday play because the Council had recently passed a motion prohibiting it.  Under Standing Orders no motion could be rescinded in the current financial year without a special call of Council.  Cr Marston argued that the Council was out of order in passing the motion because it was tantamount to a By-Law and before that notice of motion had to be given.  Further the Council was out of order because according to a 1923 minute the Council had leased the land for the courts to the Aberdeen Tennis Club for £1 per annum for 99 years, without any provisos.  As the motion passed by Council was out of order His Worship would be out of order if he did not accept a motion on the subject.

His Worship refused to accept a motion.

Cr T.H. Woollacott agreed with the Mayor on the grounds that when the town was incorporated in 1876 Sunday Sport was unheard of and no By-Law allowing Sunday Sport had since been inserted Sunday Sport was still prohibited.  When the Council had allowed courts to be built at the back of the Bowling Green no Sunday Tennis was allowed on those courts.  The old Aberdeen Club had gone into liquidation some time ago and so the current crowd running the Courts had no agreement of any sort with the Council.  If they were to leave the courts they dared not shift any of the equipment.

Cr Baulderstone said he had never commented in whether Sunday Sport was right or wrong, but he thought he was acting in the interests of ratepayers when he refused to vote to throw out something which had been inexistence for many years.  If a poll were taken he was sure Sunday Sport would be voted against two to one.

Cr Marston said it was clear His worship was determined not to accept a motion which rescinded a previous motion of Council, but he considered it the duty of the Council to reply to the letter from the Club.  He moved that the Aberdeen Tennis Club be informed that the Council could find no lease for the Aberdeen Tennis Courts and there was no By-Law prohibiting Sunday Sport.

T.H. Woollacott’s remarks concerning old By-Laws were irrelevant because they were repealed in 1938 and a new set adopted.  The minute in the Council books to lease the land should be held as a lease without provisos and the Club had carried out its part of the agreement by paying the rental of £1 per year.

Cr T.H. Woollacott could not understand such rubbish.  The Council did not need a By-Law to prohibit Sunday Sports.  It had been an unwritten law for years that there was no sport on Sundays in Burra.

Cr S.J. Woollacott said he did not waste his time coming to meetings to change a motion already carried, just because of a few hoodlums in the town.

Cr Marston said he was not interested in unwritten laws, but only those in black and white.

Cr H.T. Woollacott moved an amendment adding that ‘if tennis was played there on Sundays the Council would ask players to leave the courts.’  Cr S.J. Woollacott seconded.

Cr Marston said the amendment was ridiculous.  It was telling a body that had spent hundreds of pounds on improvements that it had no control over what was virtually its own property and in any case where would they find their authority to order players off the courts?

Cr T.H. Woollacott said it was not permissible to play cricket on Victoria Park on Sundays and the same should apply to the Aberdeen Courts. The Adelaide City Council did not allow Sunday Sport in the Parklands.

Cr Marston said Cr Woollacott had been using that bluff for too long and it was time he stopped.  A minute in the Council books of about 1938 allowed the Cricket Club to play occasional games there on Sunday and the City Council did not stop sport in the parklands on Sundays, with the exception of Adelaide Oval.

The Clerk confirmed the existence of such a minute.

The Mayor then said there should be a By-Law against Sunday Sport and he wished someone would give a Notice of Motion accordingly later.

Cr Lee said there had been similar trouble over Sunday Sport at Victoria Park some time ago and it had been found they could not stop Sunday Sport providing no admission fees were charged, because the land belonged to the people of Burra.

Cr Baulderstone suggested that Cr Woollacott change the wording of his amendment to ‘ask players to refrain’.

Cr Woollacott refused.

The Mayor said he appreciated Cr Woollacott’s position, but felt in the absence of a By-Law he did not have the power to banish players from the courts.

The Clerk pointed out that since new By-Laws had been adopted in 1938 the Council could not prosecute unless there was a By-Law.  At the orders of the Mayor, he could tell players to get off the courts, but he would have no authority to do so.

Cr Woollacott then agreed to use the word ‘refrain’ in his amendment.

On being put the motion was carried with Crs Marston, Lee and Baulderstone supporting it and Crs T.H. & S.J. Woollacott opposed.

[The newspaper report does not report the fate of the amendment, so it is not clear whether the motion passed was as amended or as proposed by Cr. Marston.]
