Burra High School Concert & Speech Night was held on 16 December in the Burra Institute.  A very good program was arranged.  A short play Such is Fame was staged and also the trial scene from Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice.  The headmaster did not read his report, which was rather long and had been printed in the Burra Record on 17 December.  Mr Charlesworth did add some comments on school fees.  No fees were charged for any student under the age of 14.  All students over 14 were given a form on which application for exemption from fees or a reduction in them can be made.  In Burra, of the 34 applications made during the past year, a total exemption was granted in 30 cases and the other 4 paid half fees or less.  No fees were charged to any student who had to board away from home.  No parent has a reason to deny a child continued education on the grounds that they cannot afford the fees.

Dr Steele gave a brief address as Chairman of the High School Council.  He hoped the school leaving age would be raised from 14 to 16 as was being discussed.

The Mayor T.H. Woollacott was then asked to present the awards.  [The list of prize winners and awards is printed.]  Joy Bentley was dux of the school.

A presentation was made to Miss Parry, who is being transferred.

[Details of the evening occupy 2¼ columns.]
