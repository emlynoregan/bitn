Burra Hospital

The opening of the X-ray plant attracted a big crowd on the 11th.  Mr & Mrs I.J. Warnes generously donated £300 towards the cost and the indomitable energy of Dr Steele in promoting the scheme led to this success.  Three MPs and the Inspector-General of Hospitals were also present.  Mr Winnall said on Sir A. Weigall’s recent visit he had suggested an approach to the Red Cross in view of Burra’s war effort and this resulted in a donation of £150 from that organisation.  Mr Winnall invited Mrs Warnes to open the room, which she did after making a very able speech.  Dr Steele thanked Mr & Mrs Warnes on behalf of himself and the Hospital Board and also thanked the Red Cross.  The MPs, T. Pascoe, T. Hawke & G.F. Jenkins also gave speeches. The Inspector-General of Hospitals, Dr B. H. Morris, also expressed his thanks to Mr & Mrs Warnes and Red Cross, as did Mr Winnall.  Mr Warnes made an appropriate response.

Relays of visitors were then invited to witness a demonstration of the machine and were wonderfully thrilled with the results.

[The process described suggests that long exposures to the rays were made, as they talk of seeing the human heart throb and being able to see coins in a clenched fist.]
