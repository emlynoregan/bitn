Obituary.  Mr Harry Byles of Burra died at Burra Hospital yesterday aged 76.  He spent his life employed on pastoral properties, but in 1931 opened up the Mongolata Goldfield and the biggest mine there was named after him.  He did not actually discover the gold â€“ that was done years earlier by Ted Bywaters.

[Henry Arthur Byles died 15 July 1946 at Burra aged 77.  There is no apparent birth registration for SA.]
