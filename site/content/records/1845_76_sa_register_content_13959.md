Kooringa News, 17 January

The solar eclipse on Friday was of general interest.  I first noticed the contact at 11 hours 16 minutes, from which time the thermometer fell rapidly.  The sky at that time was perfectly clear, but at about the time of greatest obscuration clouds came in and covered the sun so that the moon’s exit from the solar disc could not be observed.  The temperature in the sun was 115°F at 11 a.m.  At 11.16 it was 104°F.  By noon it had fallen to 90°F and at 1.40 p.m. was only 80°F.  Clouds thickened from 2 p.m. and a few drops of rain fell.  The evening was much cooler.

Prayer meetings have continued throughout the week, with united meetings for devotional exercises daily at the Primitive Methodist Church.  There was a special gathering at St Mary’s on Friday evening.

Herr Kohler, the musical celebrity, has been performing here at the Burra Hotel on Monday and Tuesday evenings.  There was a good attendance on Monday, but a smaller one on Tuesday.  Kohler gave performances on the cornopean, flageolet, concertina, tin whistle and bush piano.  [The first two named are a cornet and a type of recorder respectively.]
