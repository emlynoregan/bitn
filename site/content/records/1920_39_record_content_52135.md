G. Retter writes apparently in response to the letter from Mr Winton representing the Dept. of Mines.  SA, he says, is the only state without Government assistance to mining interests.  As to there not being miners and prospectors on the field, that is a great insult to those who have done their best to develop it in the past few years.  The assistance asked for was little enough: an increase in rations, some clothing and a medical chest.
