Editorial.  A day of prayer has been called for 18 April for the current crisis facing the colony: a ‘day of humiliation and prayer’.  Despite his religious beliefs the editor is not very sympathetic, seeing the real problem as a mal-distribution of wealth in a society in which the rich were assisted by a gross inequality of taxation demands which let them off far too lightly.  The real solution was not in prayer, but in remedial action.
