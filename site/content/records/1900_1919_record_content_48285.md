Ray Carter writes in response to ‘Soldier’s Friend’.  He comments on how willing people were to subscribe to sheep dog trials when Cpl George Powell was welcomed home and yet they are now saying we shouldn’t pay for the hall in wartime.  ‘If the latest nom-de-plume has £90 to lend free of interest for a term, I will let the hall free of charge to all patriotic affairs for same term providing we can cry off with our present financier.’  The Red Cross ladies have been more helpful and it is only an outside party causing the trouble – and all over a 10d charge.
