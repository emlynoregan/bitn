Obituary and inquest.  Mrs R. Field reported on Friday that her servant Mary Quinn had given birth to a child at her residence ‘Monavea’, four miles from Burra.  The girl had collapsed in a critical state, having concealed both the pregnancy and the birth.  The child died and was hidden in a box on the Wednesday night.  Mary is now in the Burra Hospital and the inquest which opened on Saturday was adjourned to 16 November to allow the girl time to recover.

[The unnamed female child was registered as being born and dying on 30 October 1901 aged 1 hour]
