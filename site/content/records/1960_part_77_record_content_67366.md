Burra Rural Youth held its AGM on 5 July.

The big event in the year was the successful Rural Youth Rally.  In October the club ran a successful Copper Festival Ball.  It also ran a cabaret, a tennis tournament, cleared up around two homes as a bushfire project and had a ‘B’ grade debating team.  In sport there were football, netball and swimming teams.  The annual Christmas dinner was held at the Bon Accord and a Mock Wedding was celebrated at the Royal Exchange.  There were interesting and instructive meetings, as well as social gatherings.  Heather Keane is being sponsored in the Miss Australia Quest – money raised goes to the Spastic Centre.  Elected were: President, Don Griffen; Vice-President, Michael Bradley; Secretary, Judy Beinke, Assistant Secretary, Ros. Parks and Treasurer, Lou Georgiou.
