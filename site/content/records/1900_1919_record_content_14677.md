Iron Mine has had an Arbor Day at which the congregation of the Methodist Church planted trees.  George Finch gave some ground adjoining the church and the Hanson Council allowed the fencing of part of the reserve.  On 30 August 50-60 people assembled and over 200 trees were planted.  Mr Cox of Ayers’ Forest supplied trees including red and sugar gums, river oaks, white cedars, tamarisks and pines (pinus insignis)
