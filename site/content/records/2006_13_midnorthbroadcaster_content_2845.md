The SA Stud Merino Expo on Monday had to contend with heavy rain, but it was still deemed a success.  There was a very good crowd that clearly enjoyed the displays and judging.

Eastern states buyers were more numerous than for some years.  Moorundie Park, Gulnare, took Eldersâ€™ Merino Ram of the Year and Sherlock Stud of Sherlock took out the pairs.
