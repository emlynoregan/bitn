RSL AGM 24 February.  22 attended.

President L.M. Gordon reported a good year in which the premises had been improved.  The front wall was oiled and lined and a new ceiling erected in the billiard room, thanks to a donation from I.J. Warnes.  The billiard table has new cloth and the balcony a new floor covering presented by Mr Con. Lynch.  The Annual Ball in May was very successful with a profit of £31-9-1.  Over 60 returned men formed a guard of honour for the unveiling of the Roll of Honour early in the year.  At the Anzac Day service £6-9-10 was collected for the AIF Graves Fund.  The smoke social in October was successful, but attendance was relatively small at 31, resulting in a financial loss of £1-3-6.  Last year the sub-branch began considerably in debt, but this year there was a cash surplus of £16-12-7.  Most enquiries for help have come from diggers passing through and seeking work.  Elected were President, L.M. Gordon; Vice-Presidents, J.E. Hogan, F. Spencer & H.G. Oates; Hon. Secretary & Treasurer, G. Dow.  The membership stood at 113.  [Membership was open to returned men, rejects, members of the De-mobilisation Corps and the Fathers’ Association.]
