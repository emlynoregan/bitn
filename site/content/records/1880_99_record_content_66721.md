Burra Town Council.

A deputation from the Friendly Societies’ sports Committee requested that Victoria Park be readied for bicycle sports.  Decision deferred.

SAMA refuses to consider a site for the relocation of the rubbish depot.  Solicitors for the Municipal Assoc. are to give advice whether the Local board of Health are empowered to acquire land for a rubbish depot.

Dr Sangster appointed Health Officer at £25 p.a.
