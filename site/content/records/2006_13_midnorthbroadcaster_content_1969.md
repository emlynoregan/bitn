Artist of the Month – Madeline Angel

She has won a Christmas card competition in 2001 and the Youth Section of the Clare Rotary Art Exhibition in 2004.  She received a commendation at the Burra Regional Art Gallery’s Art of the Flower exhibition in 2005.  She attends BCS and hopes art will be a part of her future, if not a full-time career.
