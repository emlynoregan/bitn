Mrs Margaret Goyder Kerr of Somerton Park writes seeking information on the life of James and John Chambers who came to SA in 1837 and who pioneered postal and coaching services in SA.  They also took up vast areas of land for cattle and sheep and went in for breeding horses.  With William Finke they discovered copper on their Oratunga station.  They employed John McDouall Stuart to move further into then unknown territory.  They were among the founders of Adelaideâ€™s early hunt and racing clubs.  Their sister Priscilla married the adventurous Alfred Barker, who came to SA with Colonel Light before the colony was founded.
