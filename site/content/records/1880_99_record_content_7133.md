The town survey is of great importance.  Not only are ratepayers deterred from improvements, but also kerbing and watertabling require the survey.

At the Recreation Ground the wall will take all the money leaving none for levelling and tree planting.

Can we not do some public tree planting this year?  Middle Ward has funds.
