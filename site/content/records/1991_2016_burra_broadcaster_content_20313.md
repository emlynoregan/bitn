The SA Underwater Training School is currently conducting a seven week Commercial Diver Training Course at the Mine Pool.  There are three instructors and twelve students involved.  Graduates for the course will be qualified to work down to 30 m.  The supervisor said that so far 100% employment rate had been achieved by graduates â€“ many of them in the field of aquaculture.  Some will go on to a 50 m qualification that would equip them for off-shore diving such as on oil rigs.  While in Burra the divers stay in Paxton Square.  [Photo.]
