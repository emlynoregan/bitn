Solomon Williams of Glenelg writes a letter concerning Australites.  When at school in Kooringa over 70 years ago he recalls another boy bringing what he believes may have been examples of these small meteorites to school.  They had come from Hampton, which was then quite a new suburb with only a few houses.  Two of them farthest out were perched well up on the side of the hill having a southerly aspect and 3-400 yards west of them lower on the slope was a large bare patch with many black ironstone rocks protruding and it was here the boys found numbers of these items the boys called ‘petrified apricot stones’ from their appearance.
