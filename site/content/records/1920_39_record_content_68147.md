Very Rev. Father Morrissey was given a farewell in the convent school on 30 August which was very largely attended by members of the congregation from Burra and other centres in the parish.  Also present were the Mayor, S. Kellaway, Rev. D.L. Redding (Anglican), Rev. J.P.H. Tilbrook (Methodist) and other prominent citizens.  Mr J. McConnon presided.  He mentioned in particular Father Morrissey’s ability to run social functions with more success than before and his tolerance and friendliness that saw so many not of his own faith present.  Mr J. Quinn spoke for Mt Bryan and Joe Mannion for Willalo, then the Mayor, Rev. Redding & Rev. Tilbrook.  Mr J. McConnon then handed over a wallet of notes.  [Detail extends for 2¾ columns.]
