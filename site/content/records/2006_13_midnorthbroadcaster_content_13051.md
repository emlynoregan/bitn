Matt Reilly may be criticised, but he has one thing in mind; the future of Burra.

He has invested and risked a lot and done so before anyone cared to see where Burra would go.  I watch Burra kids decide to leave Burra for Clare or somewhere else once they get to Year 11 or 12, to get a better education.  You cannot rely on tourism to keep money flowing into local businesses.  Mr Reilly spoke to me before this debate started and encouraged me to keep promoting baseball, even if there are not many members.  He said all sporting clubs need to continue their hard work, as kids are the townâ€™s future.  We need jobs to keep youth in Burra.  Matt was criticised for not saying two of the three closed hotels have reopened.  True, but notice of one reopening was in the same paper as his letter.  The Royal exchange only reopened because Matt and his son were prepared to reinvest in it.
