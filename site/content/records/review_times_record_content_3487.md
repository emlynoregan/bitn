She’ll Be Riot will be produced in Redruth Gaol.  An old meaning of ‘riot’ is revelry and this is what the Flinders University Drama students aim to offer the audience in this work that is based on a 1921 riot at the Redruth Gaol when six inmates escaped.  They have spent the last twelve months researching and preparing the presentation, which will involve food, music and audience involvement.  One lady interviewed was an eye-witness to the 1921 riot and her story became the focus for the images around which the play revolves.
