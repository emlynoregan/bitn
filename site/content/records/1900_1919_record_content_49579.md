Burra Identities.

Mr Richard Reed

Mr Reed was 80 on 22 January and is the person longest resident in the town*.  He was born in Cornwall in 1837 and came to Adelaide aged 10 with his parents.  They settled first at Kapunda where Mr Reed’s father was a miner.  12 months later they moved on to Burra.  Richard was engaged here in whim driving and other tasks and after a few years turned to plastering.  When gold was discovered in Victoria he made three trips to the gold fields in 1853-54.  He then returned to Burra and purchased a team of bullocks and engaged in wood carting and carting other requirements of the mine.  The men working on top were on tribute, but underground workers had wages.  The hours underground were 7 to 3.  Aborigines were common in those days and corroborees were a common sight.  There were magnificent gum trees on either side of the Burra Creek.  Eventually Mr Reed turned to sheep farming and took up the property of ‘Wandillah’.  Money then could only be got at 10% and wool prices were low.  The droughts of 1863 and 1865 were disastrous and he lost practically everything.  Mr Reed retired to Aberdeen about 14 years ago.  In 1859 he married Miss Ann Henwood, daughter of Mr John Henwood of Burra and has three sons and three daughters: Richard Reed (Aberdeen), John Reed (Mongolata), James Reed (‘Wandillah’), Mrs George Sara, Mrs C.H. Bartholomaeus (Aberdeen) and Miss Reed who lives with her father.  Mrs Reed died about four years ago.  He has never taken an active part in public life.  He celebrated his 80th birthday by ‘doing’ the Murray trip with Miss Reed.
