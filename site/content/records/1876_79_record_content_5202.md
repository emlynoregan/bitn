Burra Amateur Athletics Club meeting at Princess Royal on 11 Nov. was held in good weather 3 miles south of Kooringa at a bend in the creek. The Northern Stage coaches & Schultz’s busses ran through the day. Richardson of the Commercial Hotel had the liquor booth and T. Parks the refreshments. 500-600 attended. The championship cup (value £5) went to A. Brakenridge. Pole leaping had to be omitted due to the pole breaking and time forced the cancellation of the hammer throw and the boys’ race. Full results are printed.
