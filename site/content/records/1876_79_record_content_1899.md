Larrikinism: Minor, but annoying vandalism at the Rifle Club

Rabbits now relatively scarce around Mt Bryan - probably due to the weather

John Roach Jnr., who was about to visit Europe was given a gold locket by the mill workmen as a mark of their esteem.

Rev. G.W. Patchell M.A. & his wife were farewelled from the Redruth Wesleyan Church.

Hallett railway: There was a humorous letter satirising the railway engineer's denial of damage to the construction works on the Hallett line.

W.R. Ridgway wrote in concerning cliques.

Eastern Road: Another delegation to the Commissioner of Public Works re. The Eastern Road. This time the Mayor, P. Lane, Captain Sanders (Cr.), T. Warnes (Chairman of District Council), Mr Duell & Mr. Goodfellow favoured a road from Kooringa via Warne's Corner to World's End. Their route ran from the S.E. corner of Kooringa to SW corner of Baldina to the Hundred of Bright.

Warnes produced evidence of traffic flows for the week ending Feb. 19 showing: 121 loaded drays used the World's End Road & 26 loaded drays used the Baldina Road.

Last week the World's End Road saw: 70 drays carrying 233 tons to Kooringa, 15 drays carrying 21 tons from Kooringa & 7 drays carrying 18 tons to Redruth

The Baldina road saw merely: 6 drays carrying 13 tons 12 cwt from Kooringa & 2 drays carrying 2 tons from Redruth

Captain Sanders said the Mine had received 4,400 tons of firewood in the last six months via their favoured route.

The minister agreed that their arguments were persuasive, but it was unusual for the minister to interfere with decisions of the road board.
