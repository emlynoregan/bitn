Local Board of Health.

For the month 9 cases of typhoid were reported.

The Central Board of Health to be asked if the Local Board was responsible for expenses incurred when typhoid cases were sent to hospital.

Burra Hospital had written alleging such was the case.

Burra Hospital asks for an explanation why Elsie Rosenthal and Tommy Halls were removed.

The Mayor was doubtful about explaining this: ‘The letter ought have been written in a little different tone.’

Burra Hospital Furnishing Fund stands at £471-3-5.
