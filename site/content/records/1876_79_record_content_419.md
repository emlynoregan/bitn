Letter from W. Peel Nesbitt, Government Medical Officer

Captain Sanders has attacked me in a manner I should not have expected from one professing friendship.  He appears to have suffered from the delusion that ‘An Inhabitant’ is myself.  But even that error does not excuse the deliberate misstatements which his letter contains.  He says no fault has been found in Paxton Square by anyone with authority to do so.  He knows it is my duty as Medical officer of Health to report such matters as I see fit, to the Board of Health in Adelaide.  Captain Sanders says everyone except one (meaning me) has reported Paxton Square as being very healthy.  Yet he knows the Inspector reported exactly the opposite and only the other day the President of the Board of Health said to one of our Councillors that the statements of the Inspector and myself were fully corroborated by what he had seen and heard in Paxton Square.

Unless his opinions have changed marvellously in the past month or two Dr Cave will bear me out that the place is a hotbed of disease.  Captain Sanders says there is a letter to Sir Henry Ayers that there are no two families in the same house and where the largest numbers are, it is a husband, wife and small children.  Dr Gosse remarked that common sense tells you that there could not be seven children all small.  In fact in one house they were all ages from 21 downwards.  If no one has found fault, why has Captain Sanders caused new pits to be dug?  I am glad Captain Sanders is to treat this letter with silent contempt because in replying he would only further lower himself in the estimation of all thinking men.

Captain Sanders becomes quite gushing over the liberality of SAMA.  I can only rejoice that Kapunda and Gawler have no such liberal companies in their midst.

‘An Inhabitant’ writes again, to affirm that Dr Nesbitt did not write his earlier letter and had no knowledge of its subject matter, or of its intended publication.

W. Howitt [Rector of St Mary’s]
