Jade Queissner’s cat Missy went missing for five days last week and at the weekend was spotted by Lisa Smedley high up a tree.  Brenda Norris contacted honorary RSPCA officer Ruth Norris and soon the MFS. Having tried unsuccessfully to get to Missy, they called on Chris Taylor’s cherry picker, but that too failed to reach the cat.  Eventually Denise Kennedy from Clare Crane Hire supplied a crane and Ruth Norris and local butcher/dogman Casey Cooper went up in the bucket and effected a rescue.

The Burra Regional Art Gallery’s Art of the Flower Exhibition was opened on Saturday afternoon by Jacki Mattey on Saturday afternoon.  Harry Sherwin was the overall winner was the mixed media piece entitled ‘Joan’s Gift.
