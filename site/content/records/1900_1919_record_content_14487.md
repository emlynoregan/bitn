The Remarkable Case of Thomas Whelan.

A man in a poor state called for food at a station out east and the owner thought he was not fit to roam the bush and sent word to M-C Grosser.  The policeman found the man lying down in a hut.  He got up and put on his poor clothes, but wore a handkerchief round his neck.  He gave his name as Thomas Jackson, but later admitted it was Thomas Whelan, aged 34.  Grosser was concerned at how he carried his head and removed the cloth about his neck.  Whelanâ€™s throat was terribly gashed from one side to the other: the windpipe being completely severed.  He calmly admitted to doing the deed about five weeks earlier.  Since then he had been living on rabbits.  He was in a very dirty and tattered state.  When offered food he seemed glad to get it, but could not swallow without connecting the windpipe with the aid of his hands.  The wound had begun to heal and was not bleeding.  He had walked from Victoria to WA and thence by various means to SA.  He was brought to the Burra Hospital where he will be operated on this week.
