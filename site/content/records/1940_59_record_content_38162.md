Ratepayers’ Meeting.  This was well attended at the Council Chamber last Tuesday.  The meeting granted the Council permission to make long term leases over parklands with the Aberdeen and Kooringa Methodist Tennis Clubs.  The Mayor, Mr F.T. Marston pointed out that some years ago the Council had granted the Aberdeen Club a 99 year lease, but under the Act was only permitted a maximum of a 21 year lease, with the right of renewal.  The lease had also been wrongly granted without ratepayer approval.  Answering a question from Mr H.J.B. Jennison, His Worship said the ratepayers could not impose conditions on the lease; that was the responsibility of the Council.  Both motions were carried unanimously.  (The Kooringa Methodists had applied for a ten year lease.)
