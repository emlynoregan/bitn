Obituary.  Mr J.A. Hartley BA, SSc, died last week [15 September].  News arrived as we were in press last week.  A few days before he was knocked unconscious in a bicycle accident.  He recovered enough to recognise a few friends, but died soon afterwards.  The funeral was very largely attended.  A poem in memory of J.A. Hartley, Inspector-General of Schools by D.S.W. of Aberdeen is printed.

[John Anderson Hartley died aged 52.  The whole of the matter of the accident and its consequences is reported in detail in Colin Thieleâ€™s Grains of Mustard Seed, Ed. Dept. of SA, 1975, in the Prologue, while his achievements are assessed in Chapter 4.]
