‘Liberal’ of Burra writes to the editor concerning the coming elections.

[The contents sound suspiciously like the views of W.H. Hardy.]

The writer looks back on Burra’s previous greatness and compares it with:

‘Today it is again in a slumber even to unconsciensness [sic] and whilst some of the old residents have been obliged to leave for fresh fields new hands have congregated here to pine away their lives like a shipwrecked crew on a desert island.’

The writer puts much of the problem down to the way Burra has been held to ransom by SAMA: ‘the key is held by a crowd of brigands who would rather see their fellow creatures starve than hand it to them . . .’

‘I have heard a great deal said about the property being held by trustees etc., but are the people of South Australia going much longer to submit to their birthright being held by the trustees of a few offsprings of some who are mouldering in the grave?  I hope not.’

Last April a move to allow mining on private property was frustrated by ‘the crowd of land robbers in power’.  Remember this when voting next April.  Vote for those who will unlock the land.
