Burra Preservation Organisation

The plan to redevelop Market Square has polarised Burra people into three groups:

The Burra Burra DC, which supports the plan in its entirety.

The National Trust, which supports some redevelopment.

Those totally opposed.

Because the third group could achieve nothing individually the Burra Preservation Organisation was formed, so they would be listened to.  This group:

Endorses the undergrounding of power lines and the rearrangement of lighting on a plan yet to be devised.

Totally opposes any change in the layout of the square and Commercial Street.

The membership is currently 270 and the group will continue to act as a watchdog over Burraâ€™s heritage.
