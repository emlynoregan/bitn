‘Constant’ writes complaining of C. Heinrich’s not being taken to court for keeping the Burra Hotel open on Boxing Day on the signature of two JPs when he should have known that the Mayor’s signature was required.  He also thinks it unsatisfactory that the Mayor signed a permit for the Royal Exchange Hotel when not authorised to do so: though in this case the proprietor could not be expected to know that the Mayor had not been sworn as a JP.  The legal situation needs sorting out.
