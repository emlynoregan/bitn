Bundaleer Waterworks are written up in an article which concentrates on sharp practices in paying the workers.  They were initially given 6/- a day and only after serving probation got 6/6.  The concrete board workers were supposed to get 7/-, but had to serve a probationary period on 6/6, but there were also clearly irregularities and single men seemed to have got to the higher rates more easily because married men were less likely to leave!
