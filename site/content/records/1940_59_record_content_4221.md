Redruth Christian Endeavour gave their Old Folks Christmas Party at the Memorial Hall last Wednesday.  Rev. Usher is on holidays, so Rev. Secombe officiated.  Many said it was the happiest and best party for years.

Miss Shiela Butler, elder daughter of Mr & Mrs C.J. Butler of the Bank of Australasia and

Miss Esther Murray, daughter of Mr & Mrs Walter Murray of Cappeedee, Hallett, have received the call to the Hendon Munition Works.  Both have signed up for the duration of the war.

Nancy Pearce, of the Education Dept. and eldest daughter of Mr & Mrs Lisle Pearce has been appointed to the staff of Quorn High school.

Pte Malcolm G. Thompson writes a letter from UK dated 7 October.  He describes the trip to Scotland via Cape Town.  He contracted mumps just before arrival.
