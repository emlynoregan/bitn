Railway Timetable Changes

With delayed opening of the new standard gauge railway line there is also news that the rail service to Broken Hill via Burra will depart Adelaide over one hour later.  Mr Allen MP said passengers at Peterborough had to rise at 3 a.m. to catch the morning train and could not return till 11.47 p.m.  Departure from Adelaide at 7.10 was long after shops had closed.  He felt that at least on nights other than the Broken Hill express the train could depart at 6.10 p.m.  The answer was that the fast goods train had to depart at 5.30 p.m. and it was essential it keep ahead of the passenger train all the way to Peterborough.  The changes also affected mail closing times.
