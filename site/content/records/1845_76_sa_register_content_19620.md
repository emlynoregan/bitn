Kooringa News, 22 August

Obituary.  Last week intelligence was received of the discovery of the remains of a man on the plains some 30 miles from Ketchowla.  After considerable trouble Corporal Shaw and Police Trooper Catchlove found a human skeleton with completely bleached bones as if they had lain there for at least two years.  There was no clue to the identity of the deceased.  The police interred the bones before leaving the place.
