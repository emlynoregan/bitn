District Council of Hanson writes to the Education Department for details of the renting of the Council Chamber as a schoolhouse.  It also wrote to the Department saying: ‘in face of greatly increased school attendance the Council consider the time has arrived for the department to make other arrangements for a school building, it being no longer convenient for school to be held in the Council Chamber.’
