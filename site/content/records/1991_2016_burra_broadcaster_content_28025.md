The Eastern Districts Soil Conservation Board has launched its Management Plan, which will help in the management of the land, plants and animals.  It was launched at Redbanks Conservation Park, just to the east of Burra by Ian Grierson from the Soil Conservation Council.  There were about 60 guests and Ian Falkenberg, Senior Wildlife Ranger spoke on the social history of the area and the natural history of the reserve. Redbanks lies at the intersection of two major stock routes and in the past up to 20,000 sheep would pass through this permanent watering site.  In 1968 the area was designated a national park reserve.  Over the years it became known in SA for its off road motorbike action and camping and when the Burra Burra DC took it over it gave them a difficult management job with its somewhat complex mix of issues, including water rights.  The Eastern Districts Soil Conservation Board has recently obtained a $97,000 grant to work on the eradication of box thorns between Redbanks and Caroona.
