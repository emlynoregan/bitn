Aberdeen Croquet Club held its AGM.  Mrs J.G. Sara, the Vice-President, was in the chair.  The Treasurer for 22 years, Miss L. Bartholomaeus, reported a satisfactory year, but said she could no longer continue.  The Secretary, H.V. White, reported a pleasant year with about 12 playing members.  Early in the year the resignation of Secretary and founding member, Mrs W.H. Gare, was accepted and another loss due to ill health was Miss L. Wilks.  Mr Reg. Ellis has done an excellent job as greensman.  The coming of age party on 29 March was a happy and profitable event, raising over Â£16.  The Burra North Red Cross made a donation of 37/6 for the use of the Club Hall.  On 1 April we farewelled out President, who has gone to live at Glenelg.
