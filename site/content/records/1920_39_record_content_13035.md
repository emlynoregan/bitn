The Burra Hospital

On Friday a representative gathering saw the unveiling of the foundation stone of the maternity wing by the Chief Secretary, the Hon. Thomas Pascoe.  The main cost of the building is being borne by Mrs W.P. Barker & Mr J. Melrose. As Chairman of the Board W.G. Hawkes met the official visitors: Hon. G.F. Jenkins, Minister of Public Works; S.W. Dickson MP; the Mayor, Mr Collins; Dr E.W. Morris, Inspector-General of Hospitals.

Mr Pascoe said 70 years ago his late father had worked in the Burra Mine and his grandparents had died in Burra.  There were then a series of speeches and Mr Melrose responded on behalf of himself and Mrs Barker, who was away in Melbourne.  The cost of the new wing would be c. £2,000.  He then addressed the problem of furnishing the building and produced a letter: -

Princess Royal

Kooringa

To J. Melrose Esq.

Dear Sir,

I will be responsible for the furnishing of the Maternity Wing of the Burra Hospital, to the extent of £700.

Yours faithfully,

John Tennant.
