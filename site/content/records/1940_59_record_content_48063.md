The Burra Racing Club is in a sound financial position.  In recent years many improvements and amenities have been added to the course.  Turnover at the last meeting in October was over £1,000 and the Club showed a reasonably good profit.

The Local Economy

Burra is experiencing boom times at present.  The district income is greater than for decades.  Two financial indicators are:

More Scotch whisky is drunk at the racecourse bar than at many other similar meeting that the publican caters for, which means something at 1/9 a nobbler.

The town lies about 9th in the state, including Metropolitan Adelaide, for new car registrations and local motor traders are rarely called on to arrange terms for their purchase.

Miss Margaret Jeffery has qualified to compete for the title in the Miss SA Quest.  Donations have reached £139-17-6.  She is studying for an Honours Degree in Science.

Weather.  Big rainfalls have been recorded to the east.  Burra recorded 38 points, Booborowie 17 and Mt Bryan 53, but to the east Koomooloo received 99, Glenora 124, The Gums 88, Collinsville 84, Woolgangi 99 and Braemar 112.
