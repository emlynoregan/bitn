Redruth Methodist Ladies’ Guild.  [The year’s activities are reviewed in 1 column of detail.]

There were 51 financial members.  1951 was the church’s centenary and the Guild provided a very successful Musical Luncheon as its contribution to the celebrations.  Invitations were received to Guild afternoons at Hanson and Booborowie.  Some got to Booborowie, but wet conditions prevented them from attending Booborowie.  A fete was held on the 4th Saturday in November.  A social afternoon each month saw varied activities.  Badges were sold for the Brighton Babies Home and raised £6.  Other donations went to carious causes.  There was a service organised for the Women’s world Day of Prayer on 29 February and the collection of £3-17-6 went to the British & Foreign Bible Society.  The Guild provides the church flowers each week.  The fete allowed the Guild to give £30 to the Manse Fund and £30 to the Manse Furnishing Committee.
