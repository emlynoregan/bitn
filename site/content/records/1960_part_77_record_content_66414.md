Burra Mine

The new ore roaster being constructed by Envirotech Australia Pty Ltd for Samin Ltd’s Phase 2 extension at the Burra Mine is nearing completion.

Some 400 tons of refractory fire bricks have been bought from Kaiser Refractories Plant at Uandarra, NSW.

The work on the hearths is expected to be completed by the end of May.  The ore enters at the top of the roaster and is circulated by means of rake arms from hearth to hearth to reach the floor at 1,200°F.  It is then carried by means of a heat resistant stainless steel screw conveyor to a 65 ton rotary unit to be cooled to 250°F in preparation for further processing.
