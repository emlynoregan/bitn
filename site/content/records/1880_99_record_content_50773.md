Editorial on Council Matters.

Cr Hardy asked if the Mayor had seen a paragraph in the Record re the planting of No. 2 Reserve.  The Mayor said he had and it was an unfair representation.

At Monday night’s meeting very disparaging if not insulting remarks were passed to Cr Linkson and Cr Walsh in reference to the way in which the trees had been planted.

The Mayor said that last year the trees had been planted properly: this year the ground was ‘pig-muzzled’ and the trees thrown in.

The Councillors for North Ward naturally replied with their opinions about the Mayor’s actions.

Cr Hardy sought leave for an explanation in reference to a paragraph in the Record.

Cr Linkson followed similarly with references to remarks Cr Harris had made.

Cr Hardy moved the suspension of Clause 1 of by-law 1 which orders the Council business be conducted on all occasions with open doors.  2nd Cr Parks.

This was passed on the casting vote of the Mayor and the public were asked to leave.

The three dissenting Councillors then also left; refusing to transact business in secret.
