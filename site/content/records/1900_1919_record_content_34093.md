Burra Town Council, Monday of last week.

G.R. Ridgway wrote expressing surprise at the tone of a letter from the Town Clerk threatening to regard his stock as trespass after his lease on the reserve expired in the near future.  He offered to continue to lease the reserve for £1 p.a. for 1 acre of land.

Cr Walker did not see the need to threaten Mr Ridgway.  He understood no harm had been done to the reserve, which was let for horses not cows.

Not a dozen horses, was the Mayor’s comment.

Cr Walker was not, however, in favour of leasing any reserves.  Councillors generally were aggrieved at the use of the reserve for horses and a clothesline and refused to renew the lease.  It would, they said, cost 5-6 years’ rental to restore the reserve.

The General Traffic Manager of SAR wrote to say that the Bon Accord crossing was comparatively open and trains crossed at low speed so that no electric bell or gong was justified.

The local MPs are to be approached about the matter.

Cr Lane expressed concern at the speed of motorcars in the town.

It was decided to make temporary repairs to the 24-year-old bridge at the rear of the Burra Hotel.  The Overseer was of the opinion that ‘it will go down the creek most likely, the next flood’. 

It was decided to place a new Grietzner lamp, like that in the Rotunda, at the Kooringa Post Office.

It was resolved to erect a retaining wall on the plantation near Lewis’s Bridge and remove a dead tree at the same site.

The Mayor said the plantation near Lewis’s Corner had not yet received an official name.  [i.e. that on the corner of Kangaroo and Commercial Sts.]  Several had been suggested, including McLaren’s Vale and Harris’s Pride.

Cr Walker thought that Philip Lane was worthy of remembering.

Cr Lowe agreed it would be a good way to perpetuate his memory.

It was agreed unanimously (with Cr S.M. Lane abstaining) that it be called Lane Garden, subject to the approval of the family.
