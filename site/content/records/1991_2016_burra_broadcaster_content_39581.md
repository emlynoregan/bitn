Burra Regional Art gallery retiring Chair Elaine Gardner spoke on Radio North and West’s morning program about the financial problems facing Burra and many other galleries as people buy few works of art these days.  A proposal is being developed to assist them by means of more small financial contributions from local and state governments as well as private donors.  Burra Gallery raises money from selling cards, running raffles and competitions and selling smaller items as a shop, as well as some catering functions.  Given more volunteers, they would like to extend into showing more young people’s work and running youth workshops.
