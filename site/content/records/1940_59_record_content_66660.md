Leith Pederick writes on discovering uranium.  In the past ten years the Federal Government has offered large rewards for the discovery of uranium and the Mines Department in SA announced they had half a dozen Geiger counters, which could be hired out for a fee to those wishing to prospect.  Competition usually meant quite a long wait to get one.  A local grazier (E. Finch) who was a keen amateur geologist received a counter in July 1952 and he asked a friend who was my father, Mr H. Pederick, former headmaster of Burra High School, if he would accompany him on his explorations.  He had samples from Mt Painter, which made the counter ‘talk’.  We set out on a winter day to test an area about 20 miles from Burra in the direction of World’s End, but got no response.  After a pleasant picnic we tried a huge collection of rocks set precariously on top of a steep gully.  They were known as Wallaby Rocks and we tried them late in the day to no avail.  However, on the walk back to the car over different terrain with deep gullies, we made a discovery.  [Mr Finch] decided to make a final test in an old phosphate mine known as White Hill and it was there that the counter began ticking: faster and louder as we neared the cutting.  It became deafening in areas where greenish-yellow rock was exposed.  In the following week [Mr Finch] took two large pieces to the Mines Department and the officials there confirmed the radioactivity, but couldn’t decide on the actual mineral, saying it was worth further investigation.  Later a Departmental Geologist and a visiting American Geologist came up to investigate.  They decided that it was a significant deposit, which in places produced a count on the scintillometer of 800 per minute; well worth further investigation.  They advised pegging a claim.  Towards the end of the year a geophysicist and two geologists spent a fortnight there and presented a thick report.  They said the phosphate rock contained uranium oxide at 0.3%.  Unfortunately they also determined it was not very extensive, at about 25,000 tons, and not a commercial proposition.  Despite a lot of further tramping over many miles and to many old mine sites, we found no other indication or uranium.
