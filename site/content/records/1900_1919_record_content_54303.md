Burra Town Council.

Advice from the Hon. Foster is that the permission of the Federal Treasurer is needed to get a loan for an electricity scheme.  This is unlikely unless it can be raised locally.  The Municipal Assoc. gave contrary advice.

Peterborough advised that the cost of their scheme was £10,000 and charge 10d a unit for light and 6d a unit for power.  Strathalbyn’s plant cost £5,500 including batteries.  Light is charged at 8d a unit and powers at 6d.  There are 102 consumers.  Both schemes are said to be satisfactory.

Miss Bubb replied to Mr Halls’ recent allegations.  She denies letting him know at the last minute – he is not on the phone and the Reformatory is distant.  The Exchange Hotel is phoned in the morning and a message is left for him on his return from the morning train, or an officer intercepts him on a trip to or from the earlier train.

E. Schutze applies to be lamplighter at 9/- a day.

Tar-dressing of Market Square was discussed as outlined above.

The Electric Light Scheme:

The Mayor said the scheme suggested had no accumulators.  The firm alleged the batteries would cost £1,400 and last only 7 years.

Cr McBride said the estimates were absurd.  Fuel was estimated at £60 p.a. – the engine at the Burra Mine cost 30/- a day to run.  Salaries at £180 p.a. were also much too low as was the cost of the dynamo at £150.

Cr Radford said they had allowed for only a few hours running in the evening.

It was resolved to write to the firm for an explanation of their fuel price (given that wood in £1 a ton) and of the wages and oil costs.  They would also say that the Council would not entertain a scheme that did not include a battery.

Cr McBride will get an engineer’s evaluation.
