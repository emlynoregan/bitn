Burra Rifle Club.  Fourteen members visited the Metro Club last weekend.  A match was fired with 14 men a side over double 600 yards at the Dean Range.  The visitors found the wind hard to read.  A dinner and entertainment followed and on Sunday the visitors were taken out on motor boats on the Port River, with the idea of a bit of fishing.  Metro 997 defeated Burra 938.
