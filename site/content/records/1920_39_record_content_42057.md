Obituary.  Mr Elias Wilks died at Mannahill on Friday at the home of his daughter Mrs S. Davis.  He was born in Burra 7 March 1850 when his parents lived in the long demolished Sunday Row to the rear of A.B. Riggs’ house.  Some say the need for houses was so great that they were built on a Sunday, but others that the name was derived from Mr Sunder the contractor.  Mr Wilks was educated at Mr White’s School and Stanton’s Grammar School.  His parents then went to live at Mt Bryan East on land now held by E.S. Wilks his nephew.  In 1878 he married Miss Mary Edwards, daughter of Mr & Mrs David Edwards of Baldina and later of Kooringa.  For some time they lived at Mt Bryan East before returning to Kooringa.  For many years he then worked for the late J.M. McBride as a dam-sinker, putting in many dams on properties in the east and northeast.  He was one of the finest horsemen in the district when young and later was often sought for veterinary advice.  As he got older he took on lighter work as Inspector for the Burra Council before retiring.  He was an old member of the Masonic Lodge.  His wife died in 1929 while he was in hospital recovering from a serious operation.  He went to Mannahill on 21 May to spend winter with his youngest daughter Mrs Sid. Davis and died suddenly and unexpectedly [27 May].  Of a family of four only two daughters survive: Edith Mrs Arthur A. Davey (Kooringa) and Kate Mrs S.R. Davis (Mannahill).  There are 9 grandchildren and 1 great-grandson.  [He is buried in Burra.  There were seven children born to Elias & Mary: three died soon after birth, a son at 14 and a daughter at 19.]
