River Murray Water for Burra?

A citizen has suggested Murray water be extended to Burra.  The Mayor said before any move could be made the cost of the pipe from Hanson and the Government’s attitude towards such a supply would have to be ascertained.  The Mayor thought it would result in a flat £5 rate for water and with so many demands on the pipeline it might not have enough water for another town.  The cost to get the water to Burra would be about £140,000.  Water rates would rise about 75%.

Cr Bevan said Clare was getting up a petition to have the matter raised as a post-war project.

Cr Kellaway thought it worth considering.
