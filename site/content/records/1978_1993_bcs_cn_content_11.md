9 June 1978

This appears to be the first issue to incorporate community involvement, though under the existing title of the ‘Burra Community School Newsletter’.  The title Burra School & Community News’ appeared on the issue of 6 July.

It says that this edition of the school newsletter is the first to be distributed more widely; being available free from Wilkinson’s and Beinke’s in Burra and from the general stores in Mt Bryan, Booborowie and Hallett.

Cover.  Seven small and poor quality photographs of construction work at the school.

BCS.  Although officially opened some minor work is yet to be done including fittings for the photography workshop at the south end of Aberdeen Hall.  The level of noise in the junior teaching areas will result in the fitting of acoustic material in the slatted ceiling in the Year 1-2 unit.  A biology pond will be constructed if suitable local quotes can be obtained.  All gas, water and electrical services have now been connected to the Agricultural Laboratory.

School Crossing Signs will be installed on Smelts Road.

Peter Kearney, Vice-Principal of Savage River District School in Tasmania has visited BCS for the past nine days.  He, his wife and three children are the first tenants in the Paxton Square cottage renovated by Burra CWA.  It has been comfortably furnished and is available for rent when not being used by visiting CWA members.  Other cottages are being upgraded by the Lewis Trust.

Burra National Trust has approached the Education Department about having historic documents copied to micro-film to make them more readily available.

The Burra Youth Group has been granted $1,960 to upgrade their clubrooms at the Burra Oval.  The last two activities of the group have been a trip to the Elizabeth Roller Skating Rink and a progressive tea in the Leighton Area.

Burra Lions.  Lions International has had three preliminary meetings in Burra and 23 members have been inducted.  Dates to remember:

10 June Formation Dinner at Burra Hotel

28 June Club Meeting

26 August Charter Night.
