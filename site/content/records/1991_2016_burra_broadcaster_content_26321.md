Burra Town Hall.  Stage 1 of the upgrade.

Rooms to the left of the foyer will be spruced up and will house the Civic History, the Pascoe Collection and the Hall of Fame with portraits of the notables celebrated on the pavement adjacent to the Town Hall.  This upgrade coincides with the formal handing over of the management of the hall from Council to the Burra Cultural Centre Committee.
