Letter.  Tanin Auhl writes to say that despite three of Ian Auhl’s books now going out of print recently, contact with the Goyder Council revealed that they were not interested in buying the copyright for all or any of the late Ian Auhl’s books.  She believes it would be a shame if the books were to disappear.  What do people think?
