Burra Traders’ Association held a dinner meeting on Friday night at which guests were Jenny & Denny O’Connor, who managed Burra Tourist Office for a number of years in the mid-1980s and who had a fleet of five tour buses.  Jenny reminisced of Burra in the 1980s.  They left Burra after the Market Square development protests and Council’s replacement of the O’Connors in the tourist office, with a professional tourist officer.

Burra Art Gallery’s new exhibition is ‘E-merge’, drawn from the SA Touring Exhibitions Program.  It runs until 16 April and features extraordinary works by young emerging artists.
