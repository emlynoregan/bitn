Bon Accord Mine Site

Many relics of the busy mining days at Burra have been placed in the restored Engineer’s Workshop (1858) of the Bon Accord Mine, adjacent to the Burra Mine site.  Mining stopped at ‘The Bon’ when little copper was found and the miners went to the Victorian gold rush.  When they returned another effort was made, but also failed.  The mine’s main shaft was utilised as the town’s water source in the 1870s* when the Burra Mine closed.  Water from ‘The Bon’ was piped into Burra until 1966 and afterwards the E & WS Department gradually transferred the site to the National Trust.  The restoration of the Bon Accord site was made possible through a J150 grant of $30,000, History Trust of SA grants totalling $11,783 and National Trust expenditure of about $6,000.

[This is not quite accurate.  The real story is complex, but in outline, the reticulation of water from the Bon Accord in the 1870s was extremely limited.  It extended to only a handful of homes and was mainly directed to water troughs for animals.  It was not extended to Kooringa until 1884.  The water did not at this time come from the main shaft, but from one straddling the border of the property on Linkson Street.  The pumping operations were not transferred to the old main Bon Accord shaft until 1908.]
