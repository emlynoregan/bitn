Senator McBride & Mr Duncan-Hughes addressed a meeting of electors at Burra Institute 29 July.

Senator McBride spoke of the bombshell effect of the talk of the Brisbane Line and the accusation by Labor that their predecessors had not done their job with respect to defence.

‘Despite Australia’s British traditions [Curtin] had appealed to America for help, which was the greatest possible invitation he could have offered Japan to attack this country.’

He then attacked Dr Evatt’s role in dealing with America.

There were still too many industrial strikes.  Too much was being raised by Bank Credits.  The cost of living had doubled.  The Government was definitely socialist and his party believed in social services, but not in the orgy of them presently being carried out.

Mr Duncan-Hughes agreed.  He was against Unification [of Government].  The Government had not done well with respect to Manpower – too much went to munitions and too little to the fighting services and Primary Industry.  Men were not put in jobs for which they were best qualified.  Rationing was needed, but many irritations were caused by unnecessary restrictions.  It was the Trades Hall that ruled Australia, not the Labor Party.

‘Australians were glad to have American aid, but would have been more so if their leaders had not squealed so hard for it.’
