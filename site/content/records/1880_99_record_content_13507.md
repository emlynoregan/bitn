M.H. Leworthy of Middleton writes suggesting that the policies desired by the pastoralists re the dog nuisance would be more suitable if the animal concerned were a lion or a tiger.  No wonder no Aboriginal woman or child is to be trusted with one!  Registration cost is to rise from 5/- to Â£1-1-0 and the dog to be chained, muzzled or confined from sunrise to sunset.  The whole thing is absurd.
