The Anglican Diocese of Willochra is celebrating its Jubilee Year and visits to other parishes in the diocese have been arranged.  Locals went to St Peter’s Winulta, near Maitland, on 29 June.  On Friday at Burra there was a dinner dance and it is anticipated it will have raised c. $800.  Visitors from Maitland attended a 10.30 Eucharist at St Mary’s at which Fr Neihus of Maitland preached.  Dennis Nettleton played the organ.  Lunch was held in the Parish Hall.
