Fr Michael Hiller will be commissioned as priest in charge of the local Anglican Parish at a service in St Mary’s, Burra, on Friday 2 November.  The Bishop of Willochra, Rt Rev. Garry Weatherill will preside.  Mike Ford, former Burra resident and teacher, will return to play the organ.  It is four years since the parish had a resident clergyman.  The locum tenens during that period was Fr Roy Todd of Watervale.  The Hilliers spent eleven years in Whyalla and have just had some months of long service leave.  They will live at the Rectory.  Fr Michael will work in the parish on a half time basis, combining that with developing a new diocesan Ministry in Spirituality.  Fr Michael’s first official service will be on 4 November at 10 a.m. when the choir of Brougham Place Uniting Church will lead the singing and at 2 p.m. they will present a concert of musical items to suit all tastes.  Their conductor and leader is Rosemary Nairn OAM (sister of Robert Reed of Burra).
