Barrow Push.  The ‘Collinsville Rams’ were a much depleted team for the 116 km Medindie [sic: for Menindee] to Broken Hill ‘Lake to Lode’ barrow push on 8 March.  Lack of members caused them to change to the shorter 60 km ‘Quondong to the Hill’ section.  The team came fifth, which was good considering Mick Kessell sustained  a serious knee injury and had to be taken to Broken Hill by ambulance and Jim Robinson also had a knee injury that restricted his running to short bursts, leaving the heavy work to Gary James, Darren James, Graham Kessell and Tim Crowder.
