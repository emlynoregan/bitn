Burra & District Tourist Promotion Committee has been advised that if suitable arrangements can be made in Burra a major bus line is prepared to operate coach tours to the district.  The Committee has called for property owners ready to cater for morning and afternoon tea and/or lunch (barbecue style).  A number of people are needed to allow for varied itineraries.  One plan being considered is for a three day tour:

Day 1	Adelaide to Burra, morning tea, National Trust Museum, luncheon, town tour, hotel overnight.

Day 2	Visit a Merino Stud, perhaps see shearing, morning tea, a trip to the north eastern scenic hills, barbecue lunch, Mongolata, Burra.

Day 3	Free time in Burra in the morning and return to Adelaide by a different route.
