Angorichina TB Soldiers’ Car.

A photo of the car is published.  The car reached Angorichina on Sunday night 2 October.  The party included the Mayoress (Mrs M. Collins) and Mrs W.J. Davey Jnr.  Mrs Collins officially handed the car over the next morning.  A bed has since been sent to fit the car so it can be used even by the very sick.
