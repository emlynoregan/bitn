Mt Bryan East.  24 August.  A large quantity of rain has fallen and this will aid farmers who are fallowing.  A memorial has been prepared asking the Government to make a large water reserve at a place commonly known as The Troughs.  It is the only permanent water in a long distance; ‘other permanent water being foolishly sold.’

Residents are wondering why it is taking the Government so long to reveal its decision on the formation or otherwise of a District Council.
