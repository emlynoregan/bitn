Inquest into the death of Mrs Foy held at the Burra Hospital 25 November. [Though stated in the paper as December 25] at 12 o’clock.

D.S. Packard as coroner and John Sampson as foreman of the jury.

The jury went to the site of the accident and inspected the trestle bridge and roadway.

John Foy:

Did not hear the whistle and didn’t see the train till it was almost upon them.  After the accident he went to the deceased to help and then to the railway station to telegraph for his sons and when he returned the deceased was taken to the hospital.  He couldn’t say what had hit the deceased first: the engine or truck.

Driver:

On 7 November was driving the ballast train from the station to the quarries and coming out of the station yard he saw two persons between the rails.  Tried to stop and blew the whistle, but did not get their attention.  Did not think they noticed the train till it was on the bridge.  He believed the vibration of the bridge attracted their attention, but it was too late.  A man called Gitsham was on the truck that struck Mrs Foy.

Henry Gitsham:

Was guard of the ballast train – saw a man and woman crossing over the waterway and signalled the driver to stop and called out, but failed to make them hear.

Thomas Owens, engine driver, corroborated the above.

Thomas Queale, District Foreman:

The train was pushing 22 empty trucks.  Noticed man and woman on the trestle bridge.  They were 11 chains away when spotted and the train could not be stopped quickly due to the gradient.  The speed was about 3-4 m.p.h. at the time of impact.  The place it occurred was railway property and the Foys were trespassing.  A northeast wind was blowing to lessen the sound of a whistle.  The site is provided with warning signs.

Dr Brummitt:

The left leg was almost detached above the ankle and the right foot was crushed and the toes almost detached.  Amputated the left leg and half the right foot.  On 10 November gangrene set in and caused the amputation of the right leg.  For a week Mrs Foy made good progress, but blood poisoning set in on 18 November and she died on 24 November.

Thomas Keys said he was in the quarry at the time of the accident and heard the whistle.

Verdict was a purely accidental death, no blame being attached to anyone.
