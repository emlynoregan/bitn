Kooringa News, 10 December

The AGM of the Institute drew only a small attendance; only 9 or 10.

The Wesleyan Church has held its Anniversary services.  Rev. Colwell from Mintaro preached two sermons.  The public meeting on Monday was also very successful and the Anniversary in all raised the large sum of £100.

A large fire on the Mt Bryan Run has consumed about 20 square miles of grass.

Two accidents are expected to have a fatal result in each case.

A man, woman and child from Mt Bryan were in a cart that capsized and the wheel passed over the child’s head.

At Prince’s Town a horse kicked a boy in the head and stomach.

[Burra District for the registration of deaths records only two deaths in December 1863; neither is one of the above children.]

[The visit of the Governor is reported in more detail, but essentially repeats the report of the previous day.  The Governor’s arrival was delayed by a wheel of the carriage coming off.  He reached the Burra Hotel a little later than 6 p.m.  The texts of the two addresses are printed.  The address from the German community (in English) was signed on behalf of their committee by William Leunig, Charles Degenhardt and F. Bock.]

Last week more than 30,000 sheep left this place overland.
