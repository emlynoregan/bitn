The Caring and Sharing Group has had a successful year according to co-ordinator Mrs Toni Brown.  An over 50s running group and a walking group had been established and the elderly visitation program set up in 1984 had been continued.  $150 worth of books had been donated to the Community Library.  A new Burra doctor, Dr Ash Thomas had addressed the group in November on their role in psychiatric care.  Elections saw Mrs Toni Brown continue as co-ordinator; Mrs Val Hill, assistant co-ordinator; Mrs Lois Maxstead [sic: for Maxted] is the new secretary and Mrs May Fahlbusch is the new treasurer.
