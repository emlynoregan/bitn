E.W. Dunhill

Andrew King & Heather Bellman at Chamberlain Field Day at Saddleworth.

Mr E.W. Dunhill (89) has completed 72 years of service as a lay preacher â€“ a record unequalled in the Methodist Church in Australia.  Mr Dunhill was born at Kersbrook in SA and in his early life went to WA.  He married there in 1908 and returned to SA in 1909, taking up residence in Burra in 1915.  He carried on business as a blacksmith for 65 years until he was 83.  He took his first church service at the age of 16 years 11 months.  He was the first person in Australia to hold a certificate recognising 60 years service as a lay preacher.  He was also active in Sunday school work for many years and was Sunday School Superintendent for 37 years.
