Pip Edson writes commending the Burra Visitor Centre on its fine work and on the excellent tourism figures reported in the last issue.  She also expresses disappointment at the poor facilities from which the centre operates and urges the Goyder Council to make a decision in the immediate future to upgrade them, whether by the construction of a purpose built centre or the provision of an alternative site.  The matter is of the utmost urgency and has been on ongoing issue with the Council for many months.
