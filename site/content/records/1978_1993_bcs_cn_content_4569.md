20 August 1981 [Wrongly dated 30 August]

Burra Apex Club.  Mike Colbert has handed the Presidency on to Colin baker.  The current membership is 17 and the aim for this year is to raise it to at least 25.  Apex has pledged to continue to support the ‘Community News’.

Burra Burra DC

The Council refuted a comment in the ‘Community News’ last week that night meetings of Council were being considered, following a suggestion from the Burra District Advisory Committee.  Most existing Councillors favoured day meetings and any change would be a matter for the incoming Council.

Telecom has advised that barring unforseen circumstances the changeover to an automatic telephone exchange in Burra will occur on 30 September 1981.  The newly erected Telecom building is on Kingston Street.
