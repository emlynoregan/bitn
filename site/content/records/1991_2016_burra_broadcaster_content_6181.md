Goyder House will host a conference for isolated parents on 12 April.  Parents will come from as far as Tarcoola in SA’s northwest and Milparinka in NSW.  They will be informed about Goyder’s facilities and will provide the committee with feedback.  They will also visit Burra’s Heritage Trail while here.

Goyder House AGM will be held on 12 April.  The facility presently houses 16 students and house parents are Peter and Maureen Heinrich.  A submission is being prepared to get funds to extend the facility to accommodate an extra 8-10 students and another staff member and to enlarge the laundry and games/ leisure area.  The Goyder House committee will soon farewell Mrs Marg Heath, who is transferring to Birdwood H.S.  She has played a large role in establishing the facility and in its success.
