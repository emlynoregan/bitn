The Mayor reports that the railways sent two officers to discuss the obstruction caused by the [Aberdeen Ballast Quarry] bridge, ‘the removing of fence road’ [?] and the building of a waiting room.  They agreed that if levels taken showed that if the bed of the creek were made available for water for the full width it would be alright, then it would be done.  At the fence they agreed to have rubble unloaded near the fence.
