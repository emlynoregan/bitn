Election Notice

J. Bentham Neales announces his intention of running for the House of Assembly to represent the Burra and Clare District.  He outlines his views on several subjects:

Supports the Real Property Act, while wishing to improve certain working details.

Will not vote for grants to education that excludes the Bible from the instruction.  The outer districts must be supported in education, ‘carefully avoiding the introduction of proselytism where the scholars are necessarily of different denominations’.

Will support the leasing of Crown Lands for mineral purposes.  Will support claims for changes based on the good old West of England experiences.

On emigration: SA with only 120,000 people needs more population.  The last scheme has run its course, but Parliament no doubt has the wit to find means of stimulating migration.
