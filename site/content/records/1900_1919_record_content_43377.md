Volunteers.  Though Hampton had only 10 young men of military age, eight have been accepted and one rejected for military service.  Five of them belong to the Brown family.

On Monday in an empty house there belonging to Mr Brown the people gathered to farewell Cliff Turner, Leslie McGowan, Thomas Brown, William Brown, and Albert Dunning.  Lloyd Pearce from Aberdeen, who has also volunteered, was also present.  Three of the Browns are in camp.  J. Stewart was rejected.  The odd one out is young McGowan, who is presently working on Lilydale Station.
