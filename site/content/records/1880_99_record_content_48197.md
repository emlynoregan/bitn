Editorial on A Retrospective of 1892

1892 was a time of both prosperity and adversity.  The year began very dry and farmers were disheartened.  To the east the sheep died in hundreds and cattle and horses in large numbers.  The 1892-93 harvest however benefited from late rains and is turning into one of the best.  Hay grew abundantly and grain yields promise to be very satisfactory.  The town did less well.  An attempt to get the Baldina Irrigation Scheme up fell through due to lack of applicants.  Attempts to get workingmenâ€™s blocks established also met with little response.  One success has been the completion and opening of the Bon Accord Bridge.  About three years ago news was received that the Burra Mine had been sold, but since then nothing has resulted and we have reason to believe that much money has been spent in litigation owing to some discrepancy in the transaction.  The result is not yet known.
