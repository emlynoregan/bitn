Burra Burra & Other Mines

The year 1855 has been very successful.  It began with a major effort to reduce the water level in the mine.  The 250 horse-power engine was worked incessantly and by the end of January the water was ‘in fork’.  Upon examining the levels the company found the mine to be secure and began employing as many men as they could get together.  Before the end of March they were employing 450 and at the end of May the figure was 560.  At the same time the Kapunda Mine was in full swing.  While the profitable mines were working strongly a number of unprofitable ventures were being wound up.  These operations included the North Kapunda Co., Greenock Creek, Breadalbane, Glenalbyn, Prince Albert, Adelaide, North Rhine and Outside Kapunda companies.

The 10th Annual report of the Burra Burra Company was issued in May, at which time no dividend was declared because of the apprehended difficulty of getting ore to market in the winter, yet the Directors presented a highly encouraging statement to their shareholders.

The half-yearly meeting was held on 17 October and revealed a most flourishing operation.  In Peacock’s Shaft at the 50 fathom level the lode was 15 ft wide, consisting of malachite and red oxide of copper of excellent character.  Lodes in other levels are looking equally good.  On 31 March the company had more than 3,000 tons of ore on hand and a further 4,409 tons had been raised by the mid-year report.  The mean averages for the ores were 24-27%.  The balance of profit on hand was £61,510 being sufficient to pay five quarterly dividends of 100%.

At about the time of the half-yearly report a rich discovery of ore was made at their Karkulto Mine a few miles south of Kooringa.

At the Kapunda Mine Captain Bagot’s furnaces for reducing ore to regulus have been in steady operation.

Activities are also looking up at Mt Remarkable.  Other places where hopes were entertained were the new Stony Creek diggings between Woodside and Lobethal where a new Bendigo was hoped for.  But the yield proved disappointing.  Echunga is also seeing little activity at present.
