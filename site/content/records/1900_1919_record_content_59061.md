Burra Town Council, 3 March.

The Town Clerk reported the death of Cr H.H. Thomas.  Sympathy was extended to the family and the Mayor suggested a ten-minute adjournment and that Councillors should attend the funeral.

Staff-Nurse A.R. Morris arrived in Australia on 1 March in much improved health.

The RSL Rooms, on the upper floor of the Eastern Telephone Syndicate Building, have been renovated and are very comfortably furnished.  There is a reading and lounge room, a billiard room, a spacious balcony, the building of which reflects credit on the forethought of J.H. Gallagher.

Sgt D. Thompson as secretary has an office and all is lit by electric light.
