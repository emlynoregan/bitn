Norfolk Island Hibiscus trees in Morehead St will be removed after drought and severe frost severely damaged them.  Nine of the historic trees will be taken out, having been assessed as unable to recover.  The decision has not been taken lightly and time was given to see if they would regrow.  Some people are allergic to the fine hairs in their seeds, so the continued planting of this species has not been recommended by the Landscape architects commissioned in 2005 to oversee the Councilâ€™s street tree program.  The existing trees in Morehead St have been there for about 60 years.  It is proposed to replace the nine trees with Kurrajongs.  Pruning of other dead branches will also be done and further removals may be necessary where recovery is unsuccessful.  [Photo included.]
