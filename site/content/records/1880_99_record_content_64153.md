Cycling Accident.  When W.J. Richards and H. Tiver were returning to Burra on Wednesday evening after pacing Mr Bagg to Kapunda their tandem bike collapsed near Hamilton.  The riders were both thrown to the ground at about 25 m.p.h. and rendered unconscious.  Tiver recovered first and made his way to a farmhouse in a dazed condition.  When the farm wife returned to the accident Richards was looking around for the bike and his partner.  He was still incoherent and couldnâ€™t understand what had happened.  He insisted on wheeling the front wheel of the bike into Hamilton, believing it was the whole bike.  Tiver had somewhat recovered by this and both victims were taken to Saddleworth by coach and thence to Burra by train.  Dr Sangster was immediately sent for and ordered them to bed for several days.  Tiver was well in a day or two, but it will be some days yet before Richards will be able to get about much.  It was Richards who enthused Bagg into making the record dash and he is the life and soul of bicycling in the town.
