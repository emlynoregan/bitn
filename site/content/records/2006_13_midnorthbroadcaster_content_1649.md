St Mary’s Anglican Church at Point Pass celebrates the centenary of the building of the church with a special service by Archbishop Jeffrey Driver on 8 October.  Anglican services were first held in the dining room of the Point Pass Hotel in 1895 and then in the District Council of English Council Office in 1902.  A decision to build was made in 1905, on land donated by Mrs Rowett, with the foundation stone laid 11 October 1906 and the dedication of the building on 9 December 1906.  The sanctuary and vestry were added in 1953.  [Photo.]
