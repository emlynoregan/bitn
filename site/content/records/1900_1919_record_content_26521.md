Obituary.  Mr Thomas Harvey of Booborowie died after being run over by a wagon on Thursday.  M-C Clarke investigated.  The deceased left home a couple of days earlier to go to Wonna scrub for some posts.  He reached there, loaded the posts and started back.  He stayed at Hallett overnight and the next day got to within three miles of home.  The accident was not witnessed, but he seems to have been applying the brake when he overbalanced and fell onto the road.  One wheel passed over the body.  He seems to have managed to call to the horses to stop while in the act of falling, as they stopped before the second wheel reached him and remained there quietly until 5 oâ€™clock when the Messrs Kelly came along and found the body.  After the enquiry do inquest was deemed necessary.

[Born 11 September 1854 District of Adelaide: died 31 March 1910 at Booborowie.]
