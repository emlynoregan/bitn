Burra Cricketers visiting Broken Hill recently were surprised when proceedings of one of the entertainments began with the singing of The Internationale.  It was explained to them that it was a workers’ song and that Communists don’t actually get on very well in Broken Hill.

17 representatives of Burra left on Friday night and reached Broken Hill on Saturday morning early where they were guests and honorary members of the ‘Democratic Club’.  Some of the boys tried out the club’s ‘Fruit Machines’ where for 6d you might win £3-10-0.  After lunch they played a game at the Zinc Corporation Polo Ground.  In the evening they ‘went to the dogs’ and some went on to the Dance Palais while others attended the Swy Schools and Baccarat games.  On Sunday another match at the Polo Ground saw Burra defeated.  [Though the figures cited say Democrats were 8 for 64 and Burra 8 for 65 at the time.]  Sunday night saw High Tea at the Democratic Club.  On Monday morning they toured the workings of the Zinc Corporation.

Burra Rifle Club, Saturday.  Best results in tricky windy conditions came from W.G. Edwards, J.E. Harris & E.C. Collins.  [Edwards was on maximum handicap of 30 and the others were on 11 & 12.]  Jack Harris was best off the rifle with 90.]
