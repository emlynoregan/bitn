T.P. Halls:

Said they had not lived happily for the last 16 years and had not got on well with the children since they grew up.  About 18 months ago my wife told me not to enter the house any more.  I have given Tom £200 and Joe £110 and handed over the cabs and business to them on condition they provide for their mother.  The houses belong to me and I am getting no rent.  Remember saying recently I paid Tom wages to drive the cab.  Never used the expression ‘Alf Lyons’ to my wife.  Had no improper relations with any of the women.  Brought home a water pistol: had no revolver.
