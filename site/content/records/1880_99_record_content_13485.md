‘Fairplay to All’ writes a letter re one law for the rich and another for the poor.  The writer’s specific complaint relates to the decision not to prosecute prostitutes at a particular high-class brothel in Adelaide because so many of the ‘Upper Ten’ were visitors, including Members of Parliament, leading lawyers, and other prominent citizens.
