Advertisement & Article: Peacock’s Chimney

It is 25 years since the re-siting of the chimney at the entrance to the mine.  This was undertaken by the Burra National Trust in 1971-72.  Dismantling was carried out by Trust members Gerry O’Connor, Murray Tiver and Dudley Cockington.  The chimney was dismantled without scaffolding [!] from the inside.  Each stone was marked with different coloured paint for each layer so that re-assembly could be done in the right order.  Gerry and Carmel O’Connor donated the land for the re-siting.  The foundation block was poured by hand, using three cement mixers and volunteer labour.  Dedication was done during the first Burra Copper Festival by the Governor, Sir Mark Oliphant.  A plaque commemorating the 25th anniversary will be unveiled by the Governor, Sir Eric Neal on 18 October after a free champagne breakfast at the site.  [1972 photo.]
