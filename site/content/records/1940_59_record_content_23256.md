Obituary.  Mrs C.J. Pearce died in Adelaide on Wednesday, aged 87.  The late Mrs Pearce married C.J. Pearce in 1876.  Prior to that she was Miss Agnes Morton and was employed as a milliner by Drew & Crewes Ltd. In her younger days Mrs Pearce was a keen worker in many things to do with the welfare and advancement of the town and took a particular interest in the welfare of the Kooringa Methodist Church.  During WWI she was President and hard worker for the Red Cross.  She was of a kindly and charitable disposition and no one went in want of clothes if she knew about it.  She and her husband left Burra for Adelaide in 1939.  There were ten children: Evelyn (Mrs Flint of Kingston S.E.), Annir (Adelaide), Leah (deceased), Lisle (Burra), Unita (Mrs Howarth of Koonunga), Colin (deceased), Andrew (Sydney), Courtney (died of injuries in WWI), Millie (Malvern) and Max (deceased).

[Born Agnes Morton Thomas 12 August 1859 at Kooringa. Died 26 September 1945 at Malvern.  She married in 1883 not 1876 as stated above.]
