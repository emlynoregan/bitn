Burra Regional Art Gallery’s latest exhibition is entitled ‘Burra to Barossa’ and was opened on Saturday.  The occasion also celebrated the 150th birthday of the building.  Clare Valley artist Roland Weight opened the exhibition and Colleen Spackman produced the impressive birthday cake complete with two red pillar boxes, telegraph lines and ear phones.  Postmistress Penny Shepley cut the cake.
