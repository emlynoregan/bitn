Annual Burra Open Cycling Handicap Event

There were many visitors around for the weekend with riders and supporters of the Annual Burra Open Cycling Handicap.  Beginning in 1907 a cycling race was an annual event from Burra to Adelaide.  Later in some years it was run from Adelaide to Burra.  There were many different courses over the year, but eventually the introduction of traffic lights in the metropolitan area made the race impracticable.  The format changed to a country event and for the last several years the race has been Burra to Riverton and return.  This year riders set off between 11 and 11.40 a.m. on Saturday.  A supporting 30 km event for juniors under 17 was run in the afternoon to the Tanks and back.  On Sunday afternoon scratch races for both open and junior riders were run from Leighton Cricket Club to Mt Bryan and back.
