Dr D.M. Steele, as a member of the Burra Centenary Committee writes to acknowledge all who aided in the work preparing the Floral Float.

‘All know that the preparation was under the leadership of Mrs Andrew Tennant whose artistic conceptions were largely responsible for the faithful portrayal of the chosen design and she had many lieutenants without whose aid the superb final effect could not have been achieved.

I must also refer to the excellent work of Mr R. Fuss.  The construction of the much admired shell and sea-horses was masterly and would have done credit to anyone habitually engaged in such work.  Throughout the whole preparation and construction of the float Mr Fuss worked untiringly and I feel that the only way for me to express my appreciation in words is to say that the value of his assistance was incalculable.

I must also thank His Worship for placing his lorry at our disposal for so long a period – nearly a fortnight.  That must have meant considerable inconvenience and much expense.’

He then goes on to thank Miss Bourman, the young girls and Mr C. Whittney, who drove most skilfully throughout both processions.  He also comments on the tranquillity of the united efforts of Aberdeen and Kooringa to make it a truly Burra creation.
