Obituary.  Matthew Reilly died at his residence in Burra on Sunday morning 2 November.  He was born in County Cavan, Ireland in 1859 and came to SA when about 18.  On arrival he entered into employment with a farmer at Farrell Flat and was a tiller of the soil until a few years ago.  Over 40 years ago he took up land at Ironmine, where he made a permanent home and farmed successfully.  In 1896 he married Miss Reilly of Farrell Flat.  He decided to leave his sons in charge of the farm and to retire to Burra about six years ago.  He was possessed of the Irishmanâ€™s typical sense of humour and had a rare wit.  His kindly nature made him popular with all classes in the community and was never heard to speak ill of anyone.  He was a supporter of sport and other community matters.  In retirement he was a keen gardener and his lovely garden in Thames Street bears testimony to his love of flowers and to order and neatness.  He is survived by a widow and two sons, Tom Reilly, now of Bourke NSW, and James Reilly of Ironmine.

[[Matthew Reilly died 2 November 1941 at Burra aged 82.]
