Welcomes For Soldiers

The Mayor presided at a public meeting to discuss the matter of welcoming soldiers returning to Burra on leave.  The Burra Soldiers’ Welfare Committee had been formed in 1939 and was still functioning in making presentations when farewelling soldiers.  General Blamey had said there should be no restraint on welcoming the boys when they returned to Australia.

Dr Steele said that so far welcomes had either taken the same form as the presentation evenings, or they had been a brief welcome followed by a social evening, which everyone seems to have enjoyed.  Presumably each boy would receive leave periodically and he wanted to know if welcomes would be extended on these occasions.  He felt that, except on very special occasions, the Welfare Committee should not be involved.

Mr Riggs said the last welcome was to those returning from the Middle East and the first was mainly given to boys from New Guinea.

Mrs Ashton thought boys who were virtually discharged should receive letters of appreciation.

Mrs A. Tennant pointed out the practical difficulties of dealing with returns of one or two at a time.

Mr F.T. Marston thought all deserved a welcome of some sort and six or more at a time warranted a social and a fewer number an entertainment in the hands of the Mayor.

Mr Genders thought in practice the lack of knowledge of when the boys were coming would make that difficult.

Dr Steele moved that official welcomes be left to the Welfare Committee.  Carried.

Mrs Ashton moved an Entertainment Committee be formed to be responsible to the Welfare Committee.  Carried.

Inactive members of the Welfare Committee are to be replaced.

Mrs Ashton’s suggestion about a letter of appreciation was adopted.
