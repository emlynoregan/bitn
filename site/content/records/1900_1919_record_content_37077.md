Burra Town Council, Monday.

The Mayor reported the requisition from North Ward for better postal facilities has been forwarded to Parliament House.

Cr Lane moved that it was the wish of Council that the Mayor should be chairman of the [Burra Coronation] Band Committee.  Carried.

The Australian Metal Co. will be pleased to submit specifications for an electric light plant for Burra – the cost of same being £25.

Cr Lane read from the Burra correspondent in the Kapunda Herald that Council had turned down the first electric light scheme in favour of a larger one ‘which was not to be a toy’.  Such was not the case and he thought it unfair.

The mayor said ‘Certainly the scheme has not been turned down.’

Cr Walker thought that by now the Minister of Crown Lands should have said yes or no.  It was resolved to ask the Minister.  At present they will tell the Australian Metal Co. they are taking no steps in the matter.

Bagot, Shakes & Lewis advise the transfer of Burra Ck has been signed.

The Institute Committee is to be approached re telephone communication with the Council Chamber.

Plans and specifications were called for a bridge over the creek near the police station in Aberdeen.  [Actually in Redruth]
