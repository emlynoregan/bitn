Peterson sued Ford for £8 damages to a horse which he said Ford had fatally injured by striking it with a horse and vehicle negligently and unskilfully driven in Aberdeen on 23 March about 9.45 p.m.  Ford counter-claimed 30/- for damages to his cart.

The collision occurred outside Austin’s.  The shaft of the defendant’s cart broke off with a foot-long piece in the shoulder of the plaintiff’s horse.  Each claimed to be on the correct side of the road, but independent witnesses placed each near the crown of the road.  Deciding factors were that the defendant had but one light instead of two and the broken shaft that did the damage was the left or nearside one.  Verdict for Peterson in the sum of £8 + costs.
