Kooringa News, 6 June

The making of the new road from Sod Hut towards Burra is progressing favourably.

One of the workers on this road last Sunday sought to obtain two bottles of rum on credit from the Sod Hut Inn.  When he was refused he took them anyway and has now been charged with theft.

Kangaroo dogs kept in Burra are becoming a nuisance to local farmers.  On Monday Captain Killicoat lost six ewes and fifteen lambs, all worried by dogs.  Another sheep farmer lost even more last week.

Mr & Mrs George Case have been entertaining people in Burra this week.
