Burra Burra DC

The footpath in front of the Tourist Office will be reconstructed using slate.

Vacant land between O’Connor’s Shed [Drew & Crewe’s Bulk Store] and the railway line has been purchased from the STA.

Council has not supported a proposal by the Commercial Hotel for late night trading to 1 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays.

The 411th Regiment Cadet Unit will paint and repair two flagpoles.

Quotes for the restoration of four S.T. Gill water colours totalled $13,414.  Valuations will now be obtained.

The Anglican Bishop of the Murray Rt Rev. Graham Walden will be the guest speaker at a Men’s Breakfast at St Mary’s Hall next Saturday.
