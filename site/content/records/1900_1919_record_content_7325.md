A Bolt.  Cyril McBride, a young lad working for Drew & Crewes, was lucky to escape serious injury when the carthorse bolted from near the Salvation Army Barracks to Drew & Crewes’ yard.  The lad was holding the reins and taking off the chain when it started and he was dragged about a quarter of a mile before letting go.
