Obituary.  Mrs Stewart, wife of Mr W.A. Stewart and eldest daughter of the late B. Preece, died at Aberdeen on Saturday [21 April] aged 54. She was born in Hereford England and came to SA about 52 years ago with her parents.  She has been associated with Burra most of her life.  Mr & Mrs Stewart were connected with the White Hart Hotel in the 1870s and later with the Bon Accord which was built by Mr Stewart’s father.  In 1882 Mr Stewart, in consequence of his wife’s ill health, moved to Port Victor for some years.  They later returned to run the Royal Exchange Hotel in Burra and later still went to Petersburg, Glenelg, Murray Bridge and Beaconsfield, Victoria.  Some six months ago Mrs Stewart became seriously ill and underwent a successful operation in Adelaide.  She decided to return to her people in Burra, but the malady returned and she gradually sank until her death on Saturday.  She leaves a husband and six children: Mrs Jack Phelp [sic: Philp], Mrs J. Heithersay (Petersburg), William Stewart (Hamley Bridge), Douglas Stewart (Riverton) & Miss Greta and Gordon (Beaconsfield).  There are also two sisters and eight brothers.  [Born Harriet Preece.]
