To Clare & Back

[This is an exceedingly wordy and remarkably uninformative article given its length.]

The writer advises eating a hearty meal before joining the train at 7 a.m.  Refreshments along the track are available, but are ‘neither numerous nor extensive’.  At Gawler the traveller changes trains for the Burra line and at Roseworthy the old main line to Kapunda has become the branch line as the train continues to Burra.  At Riverton a shed is still needed and a quantity of wheat was observed there in the open.  At Riverton the up and down train cross and there was a stay of some 20 minutes.  The writer spent this time taking a vehicle to see the sights, but found most time was spent at a building that was neither a schoolhouse not an Institute and afterwards he observed the departure of the mail coach to Clare and the north via Rhynie and Auburn.  He had decided to stay on the train and take the shorter trip to Clare from Farrell’s Flat.  He wonders why there is a new road from Auburn to Saddleworth when a shorter new stretch from Rhynie to Riverton would have given a good road to Clare.  Farrell’s Flat appears destined to be a place of some importance.  The line then sweeps to the east, making Farrell’s Flat an entrepot for a large tract of country between the main northeaster route from Burra and the northern route from Clare.  The town here is called Hanson, though the station is called Farrell’s Flat and another town called Davies [now called Hanson] has been laid out at some distance.  Usually two coaches from Clare meet the train at Farrell’s Flat, but on this day only one was in attendance and it could convey only four passengers and a small boy.  There were eight wanting to travel and the writer was among those left behind.  He engaged a trap to make the 15 mile journey, which was uninspiringly bare either from locusts or drought.  The heaviness of the road limited progress to 6 m.p.h.  The hill River Run is going under the plough as it is transformed into wheat farms.  Sheep and shepherds alike are displaced from some 7,000 acres of pasture.
