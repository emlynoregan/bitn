A letter from F.J. Carey complained of harsh treatment by the Inspector.  Mr Carey implied in his complaint that various infringements relating to a stray cow were insignificant and the cow was within 100 yards of its destination when they occurred.  The Inspector’s book showed that Carey had been summoned 7 times in 10 years and that far from being near home the cow was apprehended in various parts of the town.  The letter to lie on the table till next meeting.

The financial situation as stated in the 2nd Leader above was then revealed.

The state of finances was largely due to the Council having provided as much work as possible for the unemployed.

Cr Parks failed to give formal notice of his foreshadowed motion and so it lapsed.

Cr Sampson complained that a Councillor had rushed into print (in the Advertiser) criticising the new assessment even before it came before Council.  He thought this very wrong and moved that Council declare it very undesirable.  Cr West 2nd.

Cr Hardy asked if it could be proved that a Councillor had written the item.

Cr Sampson said he could not exactly do so, but guessed very closely that it was Cr Hardy.

Cr Parks supported the general point of the motion, but was under the impression that the item was written by Cr Hardy in a private capacity and as such he was justified in commenting on the assessment as a public matter.

Cr Rabbich said it was absurd.  The fact that the newspaper’s correspondent was a Councillor did not prevent his commenting on public matters.  The whole issue was trifling.  He moved the house divide.

Cr Hardy then admitted writing the paragraph.  And said he would continue to write on public matters as a pressman and not as a Councillor.  He had only reported what people had told him.

Cr Harris accused Cr Sampson of making a practice of raking up trivial things and turning an hour’s meeting into three hours’ work.

Cr Rabbich’s motion to divide was lost.

Cr Sampson then continued to state his case, but when his motion was finally put, it was lost.
