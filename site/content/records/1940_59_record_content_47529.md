Obituary.  Mrs W. Dunhill of Burra North died at Burra Hospital 15 September aged 77.  Before her marriage to W. Dunhill on 22 September 1908 she was Miss Dora Luxford Petoni Swann of Angaston.  After marriage the couple lived in WA for four years and then in Angaston for six, before coming to Burra for the remainder of her life.  As a young woman Mrs Dunhill was active in the Methodist Church, but increasing ill health forced her to relinquish such activities latterly.

[Born 16 July 1873 Jamestown SA.]
