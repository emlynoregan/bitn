ALP Third Annual Country Conference was held in Aberdeen Lodge Hall 15 April.  A public address was delivered by Mr Richards MP Parliamentary Leader of the ALP.  He was strongly critical of Premier Butler.  Since the election on 19 March the Government nominees were in a minority in 29 of 39 electorates and yet the Premier would not call Parliament together till 19 May.  Items discussed at the conference included pre-selection and lowering the voting age to 18.
