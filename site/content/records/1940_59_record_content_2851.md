With annual costs of		£2,582

If use of the proposed Morgan-Whyalla scheme is needed	£37,000

With annual costs of		£5,355

The lack of information on the underlying ores beneath the oxidised ores of the open cut makes the whole enterprise doubtful.

Given this and with no funds having been subscribed, the Govt. is being asked to undertake a primary part in the promotion scheme.

This, even though the matter has not got so far as to indicate to whom management or control of the mine would be entrusted.

The entirely speculative nature of the whole thing undoubtedly influenced BHP’s decision not to become involved.

As a result the Director found it impossible to recommend the proposal to the Govt. as one worthy of adoption.  The prospects of success are very doubtful and the cost of testing the possibilities is high.
