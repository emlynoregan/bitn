Old Buildings.  There appears to be a crusade going on against many old buildings in the town, especially those owned in Kooringa by SAMA.  The Corporation will be asked to have the corporation Act complied with and thus get unsightly placed removed and made safer.  â€˜Many of the old structures have done good service and deserve pensioning off.
