Reward for Gold Discoveries in SA

[An announcement outlines the rules for gaining up to £5,000 for finding a payable gold field in SA.  The reward was payable out of a fund that depended on income from gold licences.  It was only payable if £600 or more was received from licences in a month.  The excess to a maximum of £5,000 was payable to the discoverer.  It was an offer limited to 1854 and 1855.]
