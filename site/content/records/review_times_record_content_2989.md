Paxton Square

E.T. Baulderstone writes as Treasurer of the Lewis Board of Management.

The following is an outline of the management, finance, etc. of the Paxton Square Cottages Project.

Most people are aware that the cottages contribute to the history of SA and Australia.

I have been connected with their management for the past 20 years and wish to bring the correct facts to the notice of the grumblers who insist their rates are spent financing these cottages.

About four years ago the cottages were transferred to the Burra Burra DC gratis, the main reason being that the Council was in a position to receive grants, etc. for their development.

During the last three years approximately $500,000 has been made available in grants etc.

The Council appointed a management board to manage these grants and arranged for a loan of $100,000 for the first stage, which opened in April 1983 as holiday cottages.

18 months later the second stage was opened.

Since being in operation, the board has paid all loan repayments, amounting to over $65,000 and capital expenditure $42,000, in addition to the maintenance and operating costs.

We are now in a position to contribute $40,000 towards the third stage with a cost of $120,000.

The Council has arranged for a loan of $80,000 for the balance, which will be repaid from our profits and will cost the ratepayers nothing, while making the property more valuable.

A complete financial statement is rendered at each monthly meeting of the board and a copy is forwarded to Council.

A yearly statement is presented at the annual public meeting attended by very few ratepayers.

‘Stop grumbling and uttering false statements among the people of our community.  I am available at most times to answer queries in a sensible manner.’
