Inquest on Tuesday into the loss by fire of Mrs Camp’s haystack at Springbank on 19 February.  W.R. Ridgway, coroner.

[The evidence is rather hard to follow and the following family tree deduced from the evidence may assist a researcher.]

Evidence was taken from all the residents of the farm and from witnesses who saw the fire – one at the Aberdeen Quarry and one at Copperhouse.  The jury ultimately decided it was probably set by person or persons unknown.

Mrs Grace Camp
