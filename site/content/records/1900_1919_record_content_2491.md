Burra Boxing Day Sports were held at Victoria Park.  The day started hot and windy, but was cooler later and the gate was £41-5-0, down only £7 on last year and was regarded as very satisfactory.  Cycling was the main draw.

The event of the day was the Burra Wheel Race over 2 miles.  The winner got £13 with the 2nd place £4, 3rd £2 and 4th £1.  Won by J. Bailey.

The pedestrian events were also well contested, though not as well as previously and the public was clearly less interested in these than in the cycling and indulged in other pastimes during them.  There was a successful concert in the Institute in the evening.
