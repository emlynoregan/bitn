Sport Report.

F.D. Scott recently rode from Adelaide to Melbourne by bicycle, being the first to do so across the 90 Mile Desert.  It took 115 hours 59 minutes.  He also broke the record for distance in 24 hours: increasing it from 220 to 223 miles.

A 5-ball billiard tournament for amateurs was begun at the Burra Hotel (Proprietor, Mr J. McClusky) on 14 January.  The first prize will be £5, 2nd £3, 3rd £2-10-0 and 4th a meerschaum pipe.

The committee for the proposed 50 mile bike race meets tonight at the Royal Exchange Hotel.
