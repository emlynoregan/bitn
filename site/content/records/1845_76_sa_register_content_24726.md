Local Government at Burra

A meeting has been held at Banks’ Assembly Rooms to consider the desirability of forming a District Council for Burra and its neighbourhood.  Perhaps nowhere in SA are the roads outside a major town so deplorable.  Before the area became settled and fenced travellers could strike out on a new track when the old became too cut up for use, but now fencing precludes this.  A Council for the repair of roads is essential.  About 30 persons attended the meeting, chiefly residents of the Burra townships.  Captain Killicoat JP presided.  Mr A. King strongly advocated the formation of a Council.  He suggested an area of about 80,000 acres extending north to encompass the southern half of the Hundred of Kingston and south to the Hundred of Apoinga.  J.R. Stephens proposed a Council be formed embracing the region suggested.  W.R. Ridgway thought this too large an area of useless country and wanted to include the Burra townships only.  Mr O. Harvey supported the proposition.  J.R. Stephens thought the district should be divided into wards.  Few of the roads would need to be constructed, just those of importance to trade.  Mr Moody was glad to see the move and thought it desirable to nominate Councillors and Auditors.  The district was divided into North, South, Redruth and Kooringa Wards with five Councillors; one each for the first three wards and two for the last.  Councillors chosen were:

North Ward	Mr J. Dunstan Sen.

South Ward	Mr McCulloch JP

Redruth Ward	Captain Killicoat JP

Kooringa Ward	Mr J. Drew JP

Mr H. Dawson

Auditors		Mr G.W. Goodhart JP

Mr W.H. Rosman

The roads beyond the limits of the proposed District Council are in consequence of the fences nearly impassable in places.
