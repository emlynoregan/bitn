Burra Student Boarding Facility

The Hon. Ross Free, Federal Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training has been invited to open the extensions to the facility on Sunday 24 July.  The extensions were completed in February this year and were funded through a Commonwealth grant through the Assistance to Rural Students Accommodation Program.  The facility currently accommodates ten students.  House parent is Rhonda Cooper.  The management committee thinks applications are likely to exceed places in the future.
