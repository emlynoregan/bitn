Broken Hill Distress.  The meeting at the Council Chamber on 23 December to decide on how to aid the Distress Fund was fairly attended.  Mr McCulloch forwarded £5 and J.R. Gray £1.  A committee was formed of the Council with power to co-opt others.  Subscription lists were got out.  An open-air meeting is called for Market Square on 31 December with the Mayor to take charge.  The cricket club will donate the gate money from the match against Jamestown.
