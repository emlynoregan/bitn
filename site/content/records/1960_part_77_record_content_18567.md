Burra Mine. The SA Government survey has found encouraging signs in its search for copper at the Burra Mine and has decided to spend a further £8,000 in addition to the £10,000 already spent.  The bore is down to 812 ft and will now be taken further.  Drilling is difficult as the bore has to be cased.  Polarisation techniques have indicated three anomalies worth further investigation.
