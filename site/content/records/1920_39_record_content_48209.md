Concerning Mongolata’s needs

L. Keith Ward Director of Mines writes to T.H. Woollacott 18 September.

Place prepared at the Government Battery for prospectors to wash their prospects.  No charge will be made for water, but the operations are to be done in working hours between 7.30 a.m. and 5 p.m.

Water will be supplied to W. Carpenter if he agrees to pay for it and a water meter.

The general suggestion about a subsidy for sinking, driving and costeening is too sweeping to be acceptable, but a workable proposal would be further considered.

A supply of explosives is being considered and a further letter will follow.

Further letter 23 October

The Government advises that it cannot act as a storekeeper and sell explosives from the battery in competition with private enterprise, but if miners were to establish a co-operative arrangement better arrangements could be made to purchase explosives from Elder, Smith & Co.
