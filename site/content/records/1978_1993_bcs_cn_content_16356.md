BCS.  Staff Profile: Julie-Anne Gray

I have just completed a Bachelor of Education at Sturt CAE, majoring in Drama-English and Science.  I am currently teaching a range of subjects from Year 8 & 9 English to R-2 Drama & Science.  I was born and raised in Adelaide and I am finding the history behind Burra very interesting.  For fifteen years I have been involved with netball and basketball and this year I am coaching the C1 & C2 netball teams and playing for the BBH team.  I also enjoy dancing, bike riding and water skiing.
