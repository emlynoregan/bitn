Burra Town Hall has become one of the favoured tourist destinations in the town.  The historic photographs, beautifully restored interior and the family history research facilities cause many to stay longer than they had anticipated.  The dressing up facilities provided for adults and children are also appreciated by many visitors.  The continuing success of this attraction depends on volunteers to staff the hall.  [An appeal is made for volunteers to help keep the place open every day from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.]
