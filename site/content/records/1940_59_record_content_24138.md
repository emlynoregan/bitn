Weather.  Splendid rains fell from Thursday night to Saturday morning, with gaugings ranging from one to just over two inches.  The falls extended right across the eastern districts and will provide feed and water for months to come.  Burra recorded 152 points and Koomooloo 180.  Morganvale at 212 was among the higher recordings and Ulooloo at 110 was at the lower end.
