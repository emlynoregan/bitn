Leighton and Gum Creek Schools.

F.G. Scholz chaired a meeting at Leighton Hall on 30 January to consider the very dilapidated state of the school.  The place needed rebuilding.  There are c. 30 pupils.  75% come from the east and a new school could be built further east, but recent closer settlement meant that in future more might come from the west.  Some thought two schools were needed.  The Gum Ck School has an average of 14 with 18 on the roll.  It is only a half time school and in future the inhabitants intend to erect a school and request a full teacher.

A motion called for the issue to be postponed for 12 months due to the bad season.
