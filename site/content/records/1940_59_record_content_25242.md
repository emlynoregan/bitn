Some members pointed out that many people were opposed to building a swimming pool because pools in other towns had proved to be white elephants and were expensive to maintain and unhealthy.  It was also thought that although the profits and money in hand from before the war would total about £1,000, the cost of a pool would be in excess of £2,000.  Others, led by Mr Jennison, thought that a pool could be built for £1,000 using volunteer labour and also the money raised before the war was held in trust by the Town Council and could not be used for another purpose.  The motion was carried by 8 votes to 4.
