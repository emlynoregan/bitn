Editorial on a serious sanitary consideration.  Mr A.H. Forder of Nelson Hills dairy says the Corporation rubbish depot is far too close to his place.  Mr Forder offers to exchange a piece of land to enable the depotâ€™s relocation.  There are several hotbeds of filth around the town where rubbish has accumulated.  Action is needed.
