RSL Notes.  [This was part of a continuing series of short articles.  I have not noted the previous ones, as they were of a general nature, but this one is of local significance in that it lists four common causes of failure of soldier settlers.]

Major factors leading to failure are:

Want of capital.

Want of home maintenance area.  That is the property is too small to generate enough income to support a family.

The unsuitability of the settler due to a large extent to war service and lack of training.

The drop in the value of primary produce.

With respect to (1) soldiers were allotted land and charged the full purchase price, plus advances for improvements, stock and implements.  This amounted to a mortgage on 100% of assets charged at 5½% to 6½%.  Even a capable and practical farmer could scarcely borrow more than 66% of the value of the land plus improvements and he can usually barely scrape along on that.  To add to the problem improvements were often overvalued.
