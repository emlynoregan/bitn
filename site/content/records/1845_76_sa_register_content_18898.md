Kooringa News, 24 August

Recent showers and plenty of frost have combined to cause sheep farmers to growl about the loss of lambs.  They are also concerned about the absence of shearers coming forward for the next season.

In the north many stations are quite bare of stock.  Those in this neighbourhood grumble much, but can be thankful conditions are no much worse.  Nevertheless, dust storms are prevalent on the Baldina Plain.

In mining, the Burra Creek party have begun work in earnest.  A second dray load of goods and tools have left for the Nackara Mine with two additional miners.  I have heard of £34 paid for half a share and know that £40 was offered for the same.  [In the paper of 31 August this was corrected to £34 for a full share.]

Miss E. Palmerston gave an entertainment at the [Burra] hotel on 22 August to a good house.

Police are on the track of parties involved in several cases of cattle stealing in the neighbourhood lately.
