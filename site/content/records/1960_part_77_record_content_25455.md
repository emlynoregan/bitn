Burra Town Council.  The Mayor’s Report 1964-65

The Council budgeted for a debit of £1,700 for the year and finished at approximately that amount.  Over the past three years the Council has expended over £3,000 on new plant and is now reaping the benefit.  The main improvement this year has been the erection of a new toilet block opposite the Town Hall.  The Council has agreed to clean up the creek area and develop a park which together with the swimming pool and proposed Caravan Park will create a real beauty spot for the town.

The Memorial Oval Committee has been financed to the extent of £500 to help with water reticulation.  The cemetery is nor a credit to the town and if looked after should not get into the condition it previously was in.  Thank go to the DC for grading etc. at the cemetery.

The old jinker has been housed in the main street.  Some ratepayers may think this a waste of money, but it is possibly the only one of its kind in Australia and a relic of early days in Australia.  It fits in well with the developing park and the National Trust building in the vicinity.

A spraying program has been effective in managing water tables.  Progress on eliminating horehound has been made, but it is slow.

The Council passed a vote of gratitude for the outstanding work in public affairs and town progress by the Mayor and Mayoress.

The Rural Youth Ball was a great success and raised £150.  The debutantes were presented to Mr & Mrs G. Gilfillan:

Valerie Griffiths	Marilyn Hirschausen

Beverly Atkins	Rosemary Brown

Margaret Murphy	Helen Phelps

Kathryn Simpson	Leonora Snell

Dawn Bogisch	Dianne Williams

Dianne Gill
