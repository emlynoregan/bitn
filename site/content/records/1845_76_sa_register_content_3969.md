Burra Burra Mines

Another survey took place on 27 September.  The miners were told by the deputed Directors that from the close of the week they would allow no grass-men more than 21/- a week in lieu of the 30/- previously.  The miners protested strongly that they could not get grass-men able to properly dress the ore for a guinea a week.  The Secretary told them that they must then be fools to be paying ore-dressers 30/- a week when they were only earning 15/- a week themselves.  He could readily procure men, as there were hundreds starving in Adelaide.

Can this be true?  I had always heard there was no starvation in this land of plenty.  If true, how is it that steps are not being taken to halt immigration?

A day or two later twelve of the grass-men went to the Mine Office to discharge themselves from the Mine and to apply for arrears owed to them.

The great engine at the Mine is expected to begin working in less than three weeks.

The Smelting Works are in full operation with six furnaces in constant use.  Sixteen more are to be built with all possible speed.

The Smelters’ Home, [later Opie’s Hotel] a splendid new house of entertainment, has been opened in the vicinity of the Smelting Works by Mr A. Wren.
