Burra Water Supply.

The local MPs Hon. G.F. Jenkins Commissioner for Crown Lands & Messrs Carter & Jettner visited on Monday and the Council informed them of deficiencies in the town water supply.  In some parts of the town water could not be got at 2 p.m. and in the higher parts of town there was no fire fighting supply.

Cr Pearce said that beyond the Kooringa Hotel for instance for four nights last week there was no water.  The Hydraulic Engineer has given only evasive replies.

Cr Woollacott said that to the Kooringa Hotel there is a 3” main, but beyond that only 1½”.

Cr Allen said that the position was similar at the back of the hospital.

Cr Riggs added his quota of complaints.

Cr Harris said in Chapel St no water was available for gardens until after midnight.

The Commissioner undertook to pass the matters raised on to the Commissioner for Public Works.
