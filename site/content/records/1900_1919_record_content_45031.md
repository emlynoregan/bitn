A.J. McBride offered £5,000 for lots 1, 2, 3, & 4 – not accepted.

The Buildings of the Electric Magnetic Separator Co. were offered, but received no bid.

After the sale A.J. McBride paid £3,000 for the mine with 262 acres of freehold and the mineral rights.  The liquidators still have to dispose of c. 350 acres.

It is expected the heap of tailings at the mine will shortly be treated profitably.
