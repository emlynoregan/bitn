The State of SA’s Roads [Editorial]

Everyone who lives outside Adelaide claims their road is the worst in the colony and no other can compete for ruts, bogs and broken bridges.  The Central Road Board seems totally unable to remedy the situation.  Residents at Gumeracha say they cannot get their produce to market.  The North Road beyond Gawler is in a state of nature; nothing what ever has been done to make it a road.  The residents complain loudly considering the value of produce sent down from this district and the amount of money spent on roads south of Adelaide.  A bridge is most urgently wanted over the Light; and that in time for the transport of the next wool clip.  Last year we are assured that no less than six persons were drowned attempting to cross it.  Half the price of land sold ought by the Constitution be spent on roads and bridges.  At the rate and prices that land is selling a good many roads and bridges should by now be appearing across the colony.  The Central Board should not be perpetually able to cry want of funds.  If it is not adapted for its object, let it be abolished.  If it the best method we can devise then let it be supplied with the necessary funds.
