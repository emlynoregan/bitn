Burra Primary School.   Headmaster Mr Ian Auhl, has been transferred for next year to Para Hills west Primary & Infant School.  Mr Auhl has been a man most concerned with the welfare of the children in his charge.  His replacement will be Miss Marlene Spratt who has been Deputy Headmistress of Northfield Primary School for the past four years.  She is something of a pioneer, being the youngest of three women who have been appointed to head larger State Primary Schools.  Another change at the school sees Miss Meredith Satchell transferred and she will be replaced by Mrs Carpenter.  Mrs Carpenter regrets having to leave the Kindergarten, which she has pioneered through its teething troubles.
