Fire.  On Friday afternoon between 3 & 4 p.m. a fire started in two places on Bert Finch’s property after the passage of a train.  Mr W. Nankivell, harvesting on his property, tried to extinguish the fire.  The alarm was soon raised.  The fire burnt 168 acres of grass and sheep yards and damaged two miles of fencing.  Mr Best lost 18 acres.  A wind change saved more country by turning the fire back on itself.
