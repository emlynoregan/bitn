Ulooloo Diggings.  The Northern Argus reports that two young men from near Watervale returned from the diggings with 1 oz 7 dwts of gold as the result of three weeks work.  They are convinced the field is payable, but the shortage of water for washing the dirt is a problem.  The deepest hole we have heard of there is about 20 ft.  Three Messrs Buzzacott have returned after three weeksâ€™ work with 4 oz of gold and are favourably impressed.  The diggers complain of grog-selling, but if the miners drink to excess it is hardly fair to blame the vendor.

News from the Ulooloo diggings this week is not encouraging.  There are still 100-200 persons there, but few are earning wages.  Still, the steady plodders are getting enough to keep them going and being their own masters encourages them to put up with privations.  They are convinced things would look up if the reef could be found and some are seeking it.  New rushes a few miles distant prove the auriferous area is extensive.
