Ruth Trevivian of Adelaide writes to the Editor.

As one who was born in Burra 70 years ago I watched the TV with incredulity and sickness the desecration of Market Square.  One of my first memories was being taken to the Square to see snow which had fallen through the night.  I walked through Market Square daily to get to school and loved the sweeping curve of the street.  I was interstate when the planned changes were given publicity and so could not register my indignation.  Now I wish to say I think it monstrous that it should be altered.  I donâ€™t recall there being accidents there, but if there were, I consider it due not to the layout of the streets, but to the condition or inexperience of the drivers.  Why the need to tamper with this lovely setting?  [The letter continues in this vein.]
