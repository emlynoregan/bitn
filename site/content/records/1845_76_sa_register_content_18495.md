Burra Mine

We learn by private advice from England that Mr J.B. Graham was in London in March trying to make arrangements for the introduction at Burra of Hendersonâ€™s patent for extracting copper from low grade ores.  We believe no conclusion was reached and it seems there is little likelihood of the parties coming to terms.
