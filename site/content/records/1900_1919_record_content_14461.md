The Burra Mine.  A glimpse of the underground workings shows that since the Burra Burra Copper Co. took over excellent work has been done.  Everything about the recent discovery is encouraging.  Work on the drive has been suspended while a ventilation shaft is prepared from the southeast drive to the northwest drive from Peacock’s Air Shaft.  Excellent milling material has been taken out in the process.  The first big lode struck since Captain Pryor took over was at the 60 ft level, but on testing the ground below that depth the lode was lost.  Then in another part of the mine the same quality ore was found at 115 ft.  If machinery was erected the mine could be transformed from its dormant state to one of great activity.  The reporter believed there was more ore in sight than 200-300 men could get out in several years.  It is a great pity the machinery is not quickly forthcoming.
