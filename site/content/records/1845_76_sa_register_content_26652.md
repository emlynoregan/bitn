Obituary/Inquest

An inquest was held at the White Hart Hotel on the body of an unknown man who died at Cartarpo Creek [sic] on Saturday evening 25 September.  J.D. Cave JP was coroner.

W. Cockrum, sheepfarmer, described meeting the man in Burra on 2 September and giving him a job as a shepherd, despite having doubts about his experience in that position.  [Much more detail is provided.]

He saw him last Monday and counted out a flock of sheep for him.  Cockrum then went north and did not return till Saturday, when he learned of the man’s death.  He thought the man was about 56, did not know much about the colony and was sober when taken on.

Thomas Roberts of Cartarpo described meeting deceased about three weeks before the death.  He described seeing the deceased every night for a week.

He was sent by Mr Cockrum to see how the man was getting on with the flock.  He went to Gabriel Cockrum’s place, but the deceased was not there.  He went seeking him towards Burra and while he was away the deceased had returned.  He saw deceased on 17 September when the deceased had said he was not managing well with the sheep.  Saw him next on Friday when he was by the fire in the hut.  Deceased said he felt very weak and had a pain in the stomach.  He was spitting blood and his legs were swollen.  On Saturday at Sundown the girl Jessie McDonald came and said she thought the man was dying.  When he went to the hut the deceased was outside the hut, dead.

Jessie McDonald said deceased had spent two or three days at Gabriel Cockrum’s and had gone then to live in the hut not far from the station.  The deceased had said he was 56 years old last June and his Christian name was Thomas.  On Saturday she had taken him some maizena at about 6 p.m. and had found him outside his hut, dying.  He was then breathing, but did not speak.

W. Peel Nesbitt, medical practitioner said he had examined the body of a man of about 60 in an advanced state of decomposition.  There were no external signs of violence and no reason to suspect foul play.  He believed the man had died of a disease of the chest, but there was insufficient evidence to say its nature.

Alfred Bradley, police trooper described the body when the matter was reported and outlined the meagre possessions.  Deceased was 5 ft 4 inches in height and had lost the forefinger of his right hand between the first and second joints.  The jury found he had died from natural causes.
