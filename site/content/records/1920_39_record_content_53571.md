Salvation Army Prospect Citadel Band visited Burra at the weekend.  The arrived in Kooringa about 7 p.m. on Saturday and were entertained by the Mayor T.H. Woollacott to tea at Mr Charles Parks’ tearooms, after which they played a few pieces in the Rotunda before marching to the Army Hall where they gave a first class performance before a large audience.

On Sunday they played selections in various streets of Kooringa and at 11 a.m. visited the Hospital where they presented a varied program.  The band played at the Kooringa Methodist Church service on Sunday evening when the seating accommodation was taxed to the limit.  This was followed by a concert in the Institute which was also filled to capacity.  The band was given supper afterwards at the rear of the hall by Mrs Hutchinson and members of Kooringa Ladies’ Guild, after which they started for Adelaide by motor, expecting to arrive between 2 and 3 a.m.

[Details of the concert etc. are reported in c. 1½ columns.]
