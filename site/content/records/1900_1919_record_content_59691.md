Burra Hospital Board.

ATNA advises the hospital will be registered for training, but while the patients average fewer than20 it will require five years training instead of four.

Matron (Sister Mildred) tendered her resignation as Sister Wood has returned from war service.

The Board discussed paying Sister Mildred for a period of illness some two years ago, but deferred a final decision to the next meeting.

Messrs McWaters & Radford intimated [presumably by letter] that they had tendered their resignations to the Chief Secretary.

Â£200 was received from the estate of the late H.H. Thomas.
