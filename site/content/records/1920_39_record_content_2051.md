Burra Town Council, 4 October.  [Check this date as it must be incorrect.]

Cr Treloar reported that the wings on the new bridge on the cemetery road were worse than expected and the SE one was in ruins and the others in a state of collapse.  Repairs are in hand.

[The problem may have been the pressure of the filling and the Council was divided on the responsibility of Mr Woollacott, who had supervised the construction â€“ though the overseer thought the problem was the small size of the stone chosen.]
