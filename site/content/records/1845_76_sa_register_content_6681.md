Kooringa News: The Flood of 8 June

Yesterday, Whitsunday, will be long remembered.  From about 3 p.m. it grew very dark in the southeast and continued to grow blacker with occasional thunder until 6.15 p.m. when a peal of thunder broke over the Mine and rain and hail began to fall in torrents.  This continued till 10 p.m. when it eased a little and the heavy weather passed to the southwest, though rain continued.  At about 3 a.m. numerous huts in the creek were washed out and their occupants forced to flee. At about 11 the Smelting Company’s bridge was washed away and after it in succession every bridge across the creek.  A survey of the wreck is awful and where the dispossessed will live is a puzzler.  A great many money orders have been lost and worst of all William Box aged 45, a widower with three children, the eldest 5 and the youngest a babe in arms, is also lost.  His housekeeper tells me that he went to bed about 11, but the baby was restless, and feeling uneasy about the flood water, she awoke him and he got up.  He put her and the children in a house on the bank, and with a neighbour began to remove the furniture, which was very good.  About 2 a.m. the water was about two feet deep in the hut and while he was removing an article the roof fell in, knocking his comrade on his face.  He managed to crawl free, but Box was knocked backwards and a large mass fell on him, trapping him.  It took until daylight to extricate the body.  He lies in a stable at the new public house awaiting the inquest.  It appears he also had £400, afterwards found in his box*.  Very few huts remain and those chiefly near the cemetery on the north side.  The township also felt the effects with stores being swamped and the street a complete river.  Last night it was three feet deep opposite the post office and it is now ankle deep there.  A quantity of flour was lost in the creek and flour is selling at 58/- per bag.  The Patent Copper Company has been stopped for want of fuel and wages at the Mine were reduced.

[*This statement regarding the £400 was later said to be incorrect by Sergeant-Major McCulloch in court on 18 June as reported in the Register of 25 June.]
