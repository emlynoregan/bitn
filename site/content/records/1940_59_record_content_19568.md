Burra Institute

A meeting of Council on 20 November decided to go ahead with the purchase of the Institute subject to ratepayer approval.  The transfer would carry a loan from the State Bank of SA of £3,160 at 4% interest to be repaid in half-yearly instalments of £112-14-2 with the right to pay off the whole or a portion at any time with three months’ notice.  A meeting of ratepayers will be called to approve the purchase.  100 ratepayers or one-twentieth of those on the roll could demand a poll be held to decide the issue.
