Christmas Message from Graham Kellock, Chairman of Burra Burra DC

When I took over as the Chairman six years ago I didn’t think I would be the last Chairman of the Burra Burra District Council.  The new Regional Council of Goyder will cover a much wider area, but should supply the same wide ranging services, but more efficiently.  This year has seen the sealing of the road from Morgan to ‘The Gums’ Station completed.  Early in 1997 work will start from the Burra end to the Robertstown turn-off.  The whole project will be completed in 1998.  Plans have been drawn up to seal the Kooringa Road in the near future.  This year Council has struggled to put its tourism budget on a more user-pays basis.  The art Gallery was officially opened on 5 October.  I thank the CFS and SES crews for their efforts in keeping the community safe.  Thanks also go to all Council staff and elected members for their efforts.
