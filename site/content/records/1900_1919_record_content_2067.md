Burra Slag Extraction Co.  In a terrible accident on Monday night E. McCann was caught in the rollers.  His left foot was caught and torn from his leg: the boot and part of his foot going between the rollers.  He was at once taken to the hospital where his left foot was amputated about three inched above the ankle.  He is progressing as well as can be expected.  Mr McCann was only recently married.

[Probably the Edward James McCann who married Annie Allen: check the marriage.]
