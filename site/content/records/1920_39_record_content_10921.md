T.J. Rule writes from Moonta explaining that contrary to statements made by the secretary of the Burra Coursing Club, he had not been written to twice to be a judge.  He got one letter on 23 May, dated 16th, but postmarked at Kooringa on 22nd.  ‘I was very disappointed and disgusted at the way your Secretary had treated me.’
