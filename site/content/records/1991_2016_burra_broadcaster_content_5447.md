Rick Williams, works manager for Burra National Trust, was digging a post hole at the Bon accord Mine site when the shovel disappeared down the hole.  He discovered some stone foundations and a twenty foot deep shaft, which was partly undermining a section of Linkson Street.  It will be further investigated, but is thought to be Dicksonâ€™s Shaft.  A number of shafts are believed to exist on the site, though none of them bore copper ore.
