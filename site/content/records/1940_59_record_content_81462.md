Mr Keith Crouch of the National Bank and his wife have been given a farewell by the Kooringa Methodist Sunday School and Ladies’ Guild on 9 May and by the Burra Football Club on 15 May.  Mr Crouch has been the Superintendent of the Sunday School, Captain/Coach of the Burra Football Team and also the Club’s delegate to the Burra & District War Memorial Oval Committee.  He was also Captain of the Kooringa Tennis Team and played in the Kooringa Badminton Team.  Mrs Crouch was a past Treasurer of the Kooringa Methodist ladies’ Guild.  Mr Crouch is moving to North Adelaide.

Dr T.J. Ashton’s 340 acres of freehold was sold to Messrs B.O. & K.K. Scholz, adjoining landowners, for an undisclosed price after being passed in at their highest bid of £27 per acre.

Weather.  In the last week Burra received 71 points and surrounding towns recorded more.

Mrs H. Cornelius and family of Burra have enjoyed meals from two outsized mushrooms that appeared in their hay paddock: one of 30 inches in circumference weighing 1 lb 6 oz and the other weighing 1 lb.

Mr Ron Sandercock has produced a film called Burra Burra, which will be screened in the Burra RSL Hall on 29 May.  It gives the history of the town and covers the industries and beauty spots and many local identities are to be seen in it.

Burra Rifle Club fired the 19th stage of the Carpenter Trophy over double 300 yards.  Best results were from R. Bernhardt, D.H. Field and M. Mitchell.

Mr Lance Fiebig began in the Ampol Trial on 18 May from Bondi Beach, Sydney.  There are eight SA entries in the 161 cars.  [Famous names among the drivers included ‘Gelignite’ Jack Murray and the radio & television star Jack Davey.]
