Vandalism.  Last week vandals smashed many of the glass domes and artificial flowers on graves at the Burra Cemetery.  Stones were found in 23 of the containers and forty or more containers had been smashed.  The lock on the door of the ladies’ public toilet was also smashed and any pennies it may have contained were missing.  Both matters are in the hands of the police.
