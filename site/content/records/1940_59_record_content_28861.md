Burra Town Council, 21 October

The cost for making the new road from the railway station to the station gates is estimated at £300.

It was reported that after inspection the Councillors were satisfied that the Cemetery Curator was doing his duty.

Council was responsible for keeping paths etc. clean, but weeds on graves were not included – the graves were private property.  Certain shrubs needed to be pulled out, seats painted and three holes in the wall needed repairing.

The Under Treasurer would be advised that genuine efforts would be made to build a swimming pool with the £400 borrowed from the Government.
