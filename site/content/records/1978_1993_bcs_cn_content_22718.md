Burra Sports Complex was gutted by fire last Thursday afternoon.

[There was no further detail except:

1.  A poem by Marg. Lloyd, which revealed inter alia that it was destroyed in just 30 minutes.

2.  A ‘Thank You’ by President Paul Wilson suggests that much of the history of the district sporting clubs was removed and at least some of the kitchen and other complex property.

3.  Both these sources are looking forward to rebuilding.]
