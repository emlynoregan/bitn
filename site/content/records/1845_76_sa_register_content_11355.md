Shingle Roofs

In the early days of the colony shingle roofs were almost universal.  The material was readily available and houses were far enough apart in the city to prevent the spread of fire.  Now the threat of fire is a serious problem and the insurance companies are raising prices to a prohibitive level on shingle roofed dwellings.  For some years a great many of the new building have either been roofed in slate or galvanized iron.  Hitherto buildings with shingle roofs have been able to be insured for 18/- per cent, but now the insurance offices require 34/- per cent, whilst buildings with roofs of iron or slate may be insured for from 14/- to 16/- per cent.  Although we think the increase more than was necessary to cover the risk, we acknowledge some such move was required for the general good.
