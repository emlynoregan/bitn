Income for the year to 14 November has been £1,453-7-11 and we ought to expect another £20 by year’s end.

Subsidy has been claimed on £672 from which the police moiety has to be deducted.  This was eventually reduced from £150 to £120 after much correspondence and with the aid of the District Members.  This will bring the claimable amount to £552.

On the amount spent up to June we should get the full subsidy and on that spent since, 75%, making about £500 additional.  There has been a delay in paying the subsidy on the Government side, which is not due to any Council fault.
