The Bon Accord Bridge has been demolished in the last few days.  It is understood to have been erected in 1898.*  E.R. Way & Sons of Thebarton won the contract to demolish and remove the structure.  The bridge will not be replaced, but a concrete causeway is likely to keep the road open.

[* The bridge was erected in 1892: see XV, 221, 7 Dec. 1892, page 3.]
