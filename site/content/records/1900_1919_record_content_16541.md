Rev. H.T.H. Wightwick has decided to accept a very good offer of a position in England.  He will be much missed here where he has shown himself able to adapt himself to any topic, social or otherwise and his discourses are always interesting.  He came to Australia about five years ago and first had charge of a church in Sydney and then in Pt Lincoln before coming to Burra about 18 months ago.  So far as he knows he expects to leave for England at the end of March.
