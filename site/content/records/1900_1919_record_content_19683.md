The work of firing up the furnace was undertaken on Monday and the first charge was prepared and went off without a hitch with molten slag flowing in about an hour.  Among those witnessing the scene was John Sampson who saw the first charge drawn from the old smelting works 57 years ago.  There will be three 8-hour shifts and a total employment of about 18.  The new process is a great invention and cheap to operate.  The blast is provided by a 17 h.p. oil engine with 9 oz pressure.  The water is recycled, though evaporative losses are likely to be about 3,000 gallons a day.  It is built to treat 30 tons of copper per day.
