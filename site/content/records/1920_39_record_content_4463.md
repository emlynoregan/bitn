Redruth Reformatory.  Last week’s Observer reported Lady Hackett’s recent visit to the Redruth Reformatory and says she realised the importance of introducing music to the girls and so she has set about getting funds to buy a gramophone and accessories for the girls.  The inference seems to be that the place was without music, but in fact they have had a piano since Mrs Holden’s time, a concert is held once a week and musical evenings given by local friends are not uncommon.  The initial performance of the Cheer-up Ladies Band took place at the Reformatory and other visits followed.  They have had a gramophone, but it was later broken by the girls.  The Observer says Lady Hackett had a heart-to-heart talk with the girls.  Her visit included a tour of the place and the daily round and in all lasted about 30 minutes.  The heart-to-heart can hardly have exceeded 5 minutes.  The girls have indoor games and also enjoy many outside pleasures – picnics, films, concerts and socials.  We understand Lady Hackett’s bridge party raised £25.
