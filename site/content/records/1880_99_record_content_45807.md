Sparks

Rain.

Farmers smiling.

A disease in fowls at Baldina.  They are dying off in large numbers.

Here’s some names: - Ching Bah, Yow Chung, Sang Fang and Gon Bung.

[Of these only Sang Fang is familiar from other references.  It is tempting to think that the last name may suggest that Sang Fang, who was a shopkeeper, has ‘gone bung’, but the first two names would still remain enigmatic.]
