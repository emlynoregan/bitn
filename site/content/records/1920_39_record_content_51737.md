Burra Town Council, 2 June

Â£1 was donated to Minda Home.

Approval that was granted by the Town Clerk to grade and gravel the Victoria Park bicycle track was endorsed by Council.

Sympathy was extended to Cr Jeffery for the recent serious eye injury he sustained.

Council will inspect the deteriorating Victoria Park wall to decide on repair or a replacement with a hedge or other steps.

The Mayor said unemployment in the town was rife and he deplored the lack of Council funds to assist the men.

Satisfaction was expressed at the reduction in the dog nuisance.  Applications are to be called for the

position of dog-catcher.
