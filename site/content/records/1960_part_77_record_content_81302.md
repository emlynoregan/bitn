Enrolment day for 1977 is Friday 3 December 1976.  The school has asked for a dental clinic to be established in Burra.  This has become more urgent since the local dentist, Dr C. Leslie Phillips, has decided to limit his practice to denture work and emergencies.  A Vacation Recreation Centre will operate at the school from 17 to 21 January.
