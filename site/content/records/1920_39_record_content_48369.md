R.J. Bernhardt asked Cr Bevan why the creek on Cow Dung Hill had not been repaired.  Cr Bevan said he did not know of such a creek.  Cr Jennison said it had been repaired once or twice, but storm waters washed it out.

C. Lynch asked if all Councillors were financial in regard their rates.  The Chairman disallowed the question.

Mr M.W. Bednall was confused regarding the various schemes for unemployment relief suggested by the Mayor and Cr Jennison at the recent Council meeting.  The Mayor said the Government had put forward various schemes: one would subsidise Council expenditure 75% for tree planting and beautifying the ground, another offered loan money at 3½%.  Bills for these two had not yet passed the Legislative Council.  To borrow money the Council needed ratepayer approval.

Cr Jennison said there was no proposal to borrow money.  It was intended the Council spend £25, attracting £75 from the Government to enable £100 worth of work.  The Government said men could take either rations and the 25% cash from Council or take it all in cash.  But the proposal was turned down by the Mayor’s casting vote.
