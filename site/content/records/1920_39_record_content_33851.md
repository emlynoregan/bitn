Miss Edith Bubb writes in support of the RSL members who wish to return the guns to the monument.  She says that untidiness should not enter the minds of those ‘who remembered the gallant deeds done by our boys in the world’s greatest (and cruellest) war.  Boys who gave life, health, limbs and saddest of all, reason, while capturing those (or similar) guns, which are now uncared for and placed away out of sight of the inspiring memorial standing in the Market Square in memory of our gallant dead, instead of “keeping guard” as they should for all time.’

‘Shall we dishonour their memory by forgetting the heroic deeds they did?  Our returned men wish the guns returned and replaced they should be and as speedily as they were removed.’ [Sic]
