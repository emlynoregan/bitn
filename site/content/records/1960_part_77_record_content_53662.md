Chapel Street Bridge.  When a loaded petroleum transport and trailer drove across the bridge on Wednesday some of the jarrah cross members gave way allowing some of the roadway to collapse.  The gross weight of the vehicle was about 36 tons.  The collapse occurred when the trailer was on the bridge and eighteen of the thirty-two drums of distillate slid into the creek.  They were reloaded per chain attached to a Council tractor.
