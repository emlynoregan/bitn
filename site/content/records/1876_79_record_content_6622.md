Editorial. The death of Mrs Statton after six days illness, which the jury said was brought on by stones thrown on her roof, came only a week after her marriage. This seems to have been a development of the reprehensible custom of `tin-kettling' so frequently kept up in this town. It is absurd and a nuisance and at anytime might be productive of a great mischief.

Mr Rounsevell has left the colony and we assumed he left his resignation behind him, but evidently not. We find Parliament assembled again and Mr Rees to do all the representing for the Burra District. Unless Mr Rounsevell returns very soon the vacancy should be declared and an election held as soon as possible.

The Post Office. Postal services are not good enough. There is one delivery a day in Kooringa, but none in Redruth. The mail cart goes to the railway four times a day, but only takes mail to Redruth twice. Redruth should get mail to and fro whenever the mail cart goes to the station. Redruth and Aberdeen should have a delivery every afternoon and Kooringa a second delivery at c.9.00 a.m.
