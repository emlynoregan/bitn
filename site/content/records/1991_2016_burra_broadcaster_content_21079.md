Floods on Christmas Day caused damage to property and roads.  Some Kingston St houses suffered water damage to carpets and a blocked culvert near the dugouts exacerbated problems in that area, causing mud deposits in some places and scouring in others.  The Council will seek assistance from the Local Government Disaster Fund for damage done in Burra, Robertstown and especially in Eudunda.  [Photo]
