YAPPA, the clothing company formed by 22 Year 10 students at BCS is selling its remaining stock of boxer short before winding up the company.  The whole exercise was part of their SACE Certificate studies.  Participants earn a Business Skills certificate.  Young Achievers Australia is the organisation which teaches students how to set up a business.  It also helps to find sponsors.  Students had to sell shares in the company and then contract out the making of the shorts at commercial prices.  Investors will receive back the value of their shares, plus perhaps a little extra.
