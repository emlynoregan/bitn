The Floods were the sole topic of conversation on Friday when farmers paid their weekly visit to Burra.  Despite the miles of fencing washed away, there were very few complaints.  Fencing losses are severe at World’s end, where Mr F.J. Duldig recorded 405 points and of that total 163 on Friday night.  Mr Ern Phillips recorded 317 points.  At Mt Mary it is thought the Burra creek reached its highest level in 40 years.  Balah and Redcliffe recorded lower totals, but at least an inch fell over that area.
