Editorial on The Town Council.

Over the last 12 months we protested against the folly of work in Fore St where £50 is wasted before roadwork begins.  The same money spent on Sancreed St would give a more direct and better approach to Redruth Hill.  We objected to the footbridge in Chapel St, where a proper traffic bridge should soon be built.  We were against taxing the stock sales.

But on the other side there have been splendid improvements in Commercial St, Market Square, the footways in Morehead St and satisfactory work on the Hampton Rd.  The inauguration of tree planting, kerbing and watertabling in Commercial St and Market Square is a good start on what must be extended to other streets.  Several much needed by-laws have been passed.  The tube well in Market Square will soon have its pump and troughs and become of practical value, and a seven acre recreation ground has been obtained for Kooringa.  In all the Council are worthy of ‘the gratitude and kindly remembrance of the inhabitants.’

The Inspectorship.  Mr Gray has resigned as inspector under The Board of Health and of Weights & Measures etc. and in that we lose a good servant, who gave many years to a most difficult task, acting without fear or favour and without officiousness.  We rely on such vigilance in a town where the water supply is from wells and the only receptacles for drainage in many places are blind creeks in the midst of houses.
