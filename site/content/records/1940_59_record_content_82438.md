Burra Town Council, 4 August

Council has offered two of the dressing rooms at the Town Hall to the M & BHA for a waiting room and clinic.

[They had been using the CWA Room, but Council had refused to allow the supper room to be used as a waiting room and the M & BHA were not prepared to use it as a clinic room only.]

A Public Meeting at Leighton with ETSA representatives was attended by 50-60 people.  Mr Wallace for ETSA said that in general the Trust would consider servicing an area when there was not less than one customer per mile and then only if consumers would use sufficient electricity to make it economical.  Accurate costs were not available for the Leighton area, but estimates for annual costs would be about:

Residence light and power		£15

Electric range	£12

Hot water service	£18

£45 p.a. [The paper of 19 August says this excludes the surcharge.]

Initial costs:

Wiring for 16 lights, range & hot water	£100

A medium priced range	£100

Hot water service	£130

Conversion of existing motors	£60

£390

ETSA will complete a survey of the area.  There was no satisfactory idea of a time frame for any supply to the area.  A survey will also be done of the area around Hallett as far north as Ulooloo.  If prospective customers there accept the Trust’s offer it will take about two years to complete installation unless a second gang of workmen is employed.
