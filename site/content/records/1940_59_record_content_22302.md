Obituary.  John Arthur Riggs died in his sleep at home on Thursday morning.  He was the eldest son of the late John A. and Elizabeth Riggs of Mullaby Station and was born in Burra in 1877.  For many years he managed Mullaby Station for his uncle Mr H.J. Riggs of Gawler.  When the station was sold, he took up pastoral pursuits in the vicinity of Burra and later retired to live in the town.  He took an active interest in the Methodist Church and Sunday School and represented the East Ward on the Town Council for several years.  His main sporting interest was the Burra Rifle Club, of which he was a prominent member and Captain for some time.  He married Alice, the eldest daughter of the late Captain and Mrs Polkinghorne of Williamstown.  He is survived by his wife, three daughters; Mrs John Marsh, Mrs Jim Marsh, Gladys and three sons: Linden (AIF, discharged), Alwyn and Ted (AIF, New Britain.)

[Born 22 November 1877 at Lady Alice Mine (Barossa District): died 12 July 1945, Burra.]
