Superannuation.  Councillors would like to see employees, many of whom are on or about the basic wage, have access to a superannuation scheme.  This, as contemplated, would produce a payout at 65 of about Â£700.  Unfortunately with the means test this would deprive the worker of the Aged Pension and yet provide a sum whose interest would be less than that pension.  The only way out would seem to be to do away with the means test.
