SA Mining Association

[Editorial]

The 5th Annual General Meeting of the Association was held and the Report of the Directors was presented.

Dividends already paid amount to £172,480 and the Directors seem perfectly warranted in promising two other payments of 200% in June and September.  There is no reason why this present prosperous state of affairs will not continue.

‘We venture to say there never ought to have been any serious interruption in that prosperous tide of affairs, which has so happily influenced the general progress of the colony.’
