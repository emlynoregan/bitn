Sgt R.G. Baynes writes from Gallipoli on 8 June.  He writes 1 column on the Anzac landing on 25 April.  He describes life in the trenches and complains that writing paper is very scarce: some soldiers are writing home on the blank side of the labels from beef tins.  [He mentions ‘Brose’ being wounded: a reference to his brother Ambrose.]
