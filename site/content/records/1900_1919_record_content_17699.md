‘Broadminded’ writes questioning whether Christians and specifically church-goers are more likely to lead purer and better lives.  ‘Is it not true that other factors play a more important part in forming character than mere belief – such as heredity, pre-natal influence, environment etc.?  As Pope wrote: ‘For forms of faith let senseless bigots fight; he can’t be wrong whose life is in the right.’
