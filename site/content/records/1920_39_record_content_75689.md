Girl Guides held their Annual Meeting 5 July and elected: President, Mrs John Barker; Vice-Presidents, Mrs D.M. Steele & A.L. Collins; Secretary, Mrs R. Jeffery; Treasurer Mrs W. Richards.

The Secretary reported a successful second year.  In the year though Mrs Carl Pearce found bringing up a small child and the work of Secretary was too much for her and we also lost Mrs C.F. Whittney as Brown Owl.  Mrs G.H. Dow, one of the Vice-Presidents also went to Adelaide to live. Miss Lott took over as Brown Owl.  Miss June Clifford took over as Guide Lieut. from Miss Margaret Pearce.  Free use of the CWA Rest Room has been appreciated.  Other activities are reported.
