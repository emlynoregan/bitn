[Recent photo of Burra Railway Station.]

Restoration work on the Burra Railway Station is making progress with tradespeople and volunteers co-operating.  Here the new roof is being installed.  Another part of the project is fresh painting.

[There is also a photo on page 9 of Roy Taplin preparing the front door for a new coat of paint.]
