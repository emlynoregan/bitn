Burra Town Council, 20 January

Cost for the Fire Brigade for the year: £78.

Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. is willing to give the Council the piece of land required for a road to the school and the land between the proposed road and the school if the Council pays the transfer fees and legal costs.  These would be about £10.  The offer was accepted.

Cr Morgan and the Mayor were given power to buy a new horse.  One of the present horses is too old to be used safely.
