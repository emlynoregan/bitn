The event was severely curtailed by the epidemic of gastric influenza which afflicted both staff and students.  Nevertheless on 20 December a varied and enjoyable program was presented and the main item cut was the Chinese play, whose main cast members were afflicted.  The concert is reviewed in a little over ½ column.  Due to the heat Dr Steele was brief in his speech as Chairman of the High School Council.  He thought that this would be the last such assembly at the Institute, as by this time next year the school would have its own assembly hall.  He spoke of the opportunities offered by education.  Referring to the departure from town of Mrs G.H. Dow and Rev. Redding he praised them both for their contributions to the High and Primary Schools.

The Head Master’s report was then read for 1937 and 1938 – due to the postponement of the 1937 break-up.

The three main events in 1937 had been:

The formation of the Parents & Friends Association.

Good exam results.

Winning the Mid-North High Schools Sports Shield.

In exam results the school recorded:

3 Leaving Honours passes.

5 Leaving Certificates.

8 Intermediate Certificates.

Much additional school equipment was also acquired and the Domestic Arts Centre was modernised.

1938 saw a record enrolment due to a large First Year class.

The staff changed almost completely.

Two junior teachers were appointed and the school had a staff of 5.  The Parents & Friends and the new High School Council elected in April, together with similar Primary School bodies convinced the Department of the need for immediate alterations to the school.  The new High School Library is expected to be in use by the start of 1939 and the Assembly Hall will give the school a more equal footing with others.  Money raised by the Parents & Friends Assoc. should fund a stage in the Hall and a bicycle shed and £25 goes to the library, attracting a £ for £ subsidy.  The new aids of cinema, wireless and amplifier have been used to advantage in 1938.
