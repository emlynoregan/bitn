Burra has a community enriched by history and community spirit and I see the possibility of serving on Council as an opportunity to make my contribution for the towns’ residents.

In particular I feel women in the Burra area do need to be represented at Local Government level.

I have a strong belief that Councils represent people and if elected will visit as many homes as possible to find out the views and ideas of residents.

Derek Rayfield (ex-serviceman & businessman)

Have lived in Burra for several years.

Would like to work for the improvement of roads and footpaths around Burra.

Secondly would like to place the town firmly on the tourist map.  With the mine closed and farmers in lean times, tourism is the other major source of income.

If not tourism we must attract other forms of industry.
