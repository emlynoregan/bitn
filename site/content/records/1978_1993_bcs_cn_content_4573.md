Burra Burra DC

The Council refuted a comment in the ‘Community News’ last week that night meetings of Council were being considered, following a suggestion from the Burra District Advisory Committee.  Most existing Councillors favoured day meetings and any change would be a matter for the incoming Council.

Telecom has advised that barring unforseen circumstances the changeover to an automatic telephone exchange in Burra will occur on 30 September 1981.  The newly erected Telecom building is on Kingston Street.
