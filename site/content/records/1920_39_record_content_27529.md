Burra Town Council

The Local Government Department has removed from the schedule of main roads the road to the station and that to the eastern boundary of Redruth.  It has made the main road out of Redruth the one past Sara’s and the sale yards.

Texas Co. was allowed to erect three petrol pumps outside its business premises.

T.H. Woollacott was granted permission to erect a house on section 3334 for Mr H. Morgan.  [This is a mistake, as there is no section 3334 and no allotment 3334 either within the Corporation area.]

Discussion on road maintenance dominated the meeting.

The main roads schedule was discussed and the Government will be asked to reinstate the road on the eastern boundary from the bridge to Abberton Park.
