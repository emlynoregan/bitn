Fire at Mt Bryan East on 11 January burnt grass on Mr Melrose’s, Mr Dunstan’s, Mr George Tiver’s and Dare Bros. properties.  In the evening a break away consumed Mrs Webber’s paddocks and E. Wilks’ crop was only saved by rain.  B.H.K. Dunstan lost most fencing, half his grass and over 100 sheep.  Others lost grass and fencing.  H. Tralaggan lost 12 bags of wheat, though about 170 bags were saved.  Over 3,000 acres were burnt, but all homesteads were saved, though some were threatened.
