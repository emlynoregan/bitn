Burra Town Council.

On Monday night the Mayor reported that Mr Sedgman of the Waterworks had written to the Hydraulic Engineer with reference to the recent fire drawing attention to the fact that the people had drawn water without first giving notice.  He told M-C Queale that he had exceeded his duty in using the hydrant and when he noticed the fire he should have returned to his office and written and posted an application to use the water.  The Department had now claimed the hydrant and taken possession of it.

Cr Killicoat suggested they inquire what notice they would require for use of water in the event of a fire.

Cr McBride suggested formal permission be asked for use of water in the event of a fire.

Cr Radford moved that and also to allow the Council to hold the hydrant.  Carried.
