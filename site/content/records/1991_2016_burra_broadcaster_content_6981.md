The Governor General, Mr Bill Hayden officially unveiled the restored S.T. Gill watercolours at Morphett’s Enginehouse in the Burra Mine Museum last Friday. District Council Chairman Graham Kellock explained how two of the paintings had been unearthed from beneath the stage of the Town Hall, while two were recovered from the Burra Rubbish Dump.*  The paintings had then been kept for some time by the State art Gallery before it was decided to restore them.  They had not been on public view for many years.  [Photo.]
