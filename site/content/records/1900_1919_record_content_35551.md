Burra Town Council, Monday.

The Council discussed the Columbia Boysâ€™ Brigade visit.  [See above.]

C.J. Pearce wrote that he was rebuilding and asked permission to erect a verandah and remove certain trees whose roots would injure walls.  The verandah was approved and the trees to be inspected.

The Town Clerk reported distributing 2,500 trees.

Cr Lane reported that children had pulled up 20 of the newly planted trees in Thames Street.

Cr Parks moved that water be laid on to the plantation opposite Lane Garden.

Cr Lowe moved that Jessie St be properly fenced.  The place was in a disgraceful state.  The fence should prevent rubbish blowing out.

There was discussion as to who owned the creek from the Black Bridge to the bridge near the railway station.  The Mayor said it was unclear.

Cr Lane moved that the Mayor and the solicitor (Mr Winnall) with the consulting engineer (From Turner & Robertson) form a deputation to lay the electric light scheme before the Minister.  Carried.
