150 Years of the Burra Police

When copper was discovered at Burra in 1845 the nearest police were two mounted constables 30 miles away at Bungaree Station, where they were busy protecting the local flocks of sheep.  In 1846 the Commissioner of Police, Captain Finnis came north to establish a police office and see to the appointment of a resident magistrate â€“ made necessary by the Burra Burra Mine and the increased traffic on the North Road.  Two mounted and two foot constables were allotted the area, though it took some time for them to arrive.  The 150th anniversary of police in Burra will be marked by the visit of the Police Band, which will present a special concert in Redruth Gaol on Tuesday 26 November.
