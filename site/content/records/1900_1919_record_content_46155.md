Anzac Day in Burra.  The Mayor presided at the Burra Institute with Rev. Father Kett, Rev. A.J. Finch, and Rev. D.B. Bridgwood.  (Rev. S.J. Bloyd was absent from Burra.)

Mr Crewes read the names of the Burra enlistees who had taken part in the Gallipoli Landing:

Newton King, Essen Rule, Fred Wheatley, Fred Harvey, George Thomson, Vernon Day, Hartley Harris, Arthur Stewart, Eric Roach, John Camp (killed) and Harry Skinner (missing).

He gave a short speech, followed by a few words from Rev. Father Kett, who recited the Charge of the Light Brigade.  This was followed by the hymn, For the Men at the Front.  Rev. A.D. Bridgwood then spoke and was followed by the hymn, Onward Christian Soldiers.

Rev. A.J. Finch was briefer, but equally full of the sentiments of the others and the evening closed with the National Anthem and God Bless Our Splendid Men.
