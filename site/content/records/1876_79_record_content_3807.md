Burra Cemetery. A letter to the editor poses a number of questions relating to the cemetery. SAMA gave the cemetery to a trust. The writer wants to know: Who were the trustees?

Did they appoint the late curator, David Wells?

Has the cemetery been properly conveyed to the Corporation? Could the trust spend cemetery funds on other matters? What happened to the £140 received from the late curator? Has it been kept separate from other Corporation moneys?

Can the Corporation use it for non-cemetery purposes?

Why, if it is still there, cannot it be used to put the cemetery in good order? He goes on to say that “the idea of a `trellised arbour' as a substitute for a mortuary chapel is delicious in its absurdity." A mortuary chapel is needed:

To obviate the necessity of very often taking the body a long way round to whatever church the deceased may have belonged to.

Because in this climate it is most undesirable, in very many cases, to take the corpse into a place of worship.

The conditions of the cemetery are much worse than under the curatorship of David Wells and so either the money mentioned above should be expended on the cemetery or the Corporation should carry out its duty from its other funds.

I am Sirs etc. Y
