Police Court, Kooringa, 25 November

Thomas Haldane was charged by Robert Henderson with breaking down his house door on 23 November and assaulting him.  Henderson said the accused came to his house at 4 a.m. and knocked for entrance.  When this was denied he forced the door open.  Henderson was greatly frightened by his demeanour and threatened to get a gun and shoot him.  Haldane then struck him and tore his shirt.  Others living near then came and got the defendant away.

John Tylor slept in the same room as Henderson and corroborated his account.

James Houghton lived nearby and came in after the struggle.  Defendant was present and did not deny the account Henderson gave of the incident as above.

Haldane said he had been living with the complainant and on being refused admission had pushed on the door, which had opened.  He had struck the complainant only when apprehensive that Henderson would shoot him as he threatened.

His Worship considered the charge proved and fined Haldane 40/- plus costs and bound him over to keep the peace for six months.
