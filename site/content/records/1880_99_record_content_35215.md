Local Industries No. 5: Burra Aerated Water & Cordial Manufactory

Located in Queen St: current proprietor, R.M. Birt.

The factory was established about 14 years ago by Mr Munro who sold it after about one year to Mr N. Lihou who carried on the business with two or three of his sons for about six years when he sold to Mr Birt.  A large outside business has been done which has encouraged the owner to a considerable extension of plant and machinery.  The main products are ginger ale, lemonade, soda water, and a range of cordials.  There is machinery for a much larger production than is presently provided.  On the ground floor there is a soda water machine capable of 200 dozen bottles a day.  The machine is worked by horsepower with a large horseworks erected outside the building with a set of pulleys and belts to direct the speed as required.  Part of the building has large troughs for washing bottles.  Beneath the factory is a large cellar used solely for the manufacture of cordials.  There is a journeyman manufacturer, a wirer, bottle washer, labellers, carters etc.
