Ratepayers’ Meeting

Last Thursday a meeting was held to discuss improvements to Market Square in place of the present structure around the pump.  There was a large attendance and Mayor S. Burns presided.

Cr Wise said it would soon be necessary to remove the present unsightly structure and also the trees, which were interfering with the pipes.  It was suggested that there be a wall topped with a steel railing; the enclosure to be in the shape of a horseshoe.

Mr George Sampson said that if something were done to improve the square he would be prepared to contribute a ‘fiver’.

Mr C. Fuss thought the Council was correct to consult with the ratepayers and he would like to see improvements if the costs were not too high.

Mr John Pearce would also support the work if at reasonable cost.

Crs Walker from North Ward and Lane & Ockenden from East Ward were opposed to any of the costs coming from their respective wards.

Cr W.H. Hardy supported the improvement scheme and thought it could be done for little cost to the Council.  He moved that the Mayor start a fund with a view to erecting a suitable enclosure in Market Square, that the Council be asked to assist and that the proposed structure be dedicated to the memory of the late King Edward VII, bearing a suitable inscription or stone and that the Town Council be a committee to attend to the matter on behalf of the citizens and the town.

Cr Wise seconded and Crs Walker, Lane & Ockenden withdrew their objections.

Mr John Drew then expressed his support, but said it might be best not to confine the matter to the town, but to invite the sympathy of the residents of the whole district.

Cr Hardy then said that if Cr Wise was agreeable, they would withdraw his proposal in favour of something along the lines suggested by Mr Drew.  Cr Wise agreed and Mr Drew then proposed:

‘That a public meeting of the residents of the town and district be called for Friday June 3 at 7.30 p.m., to discuss the whole matter and deal with same.’  Seconded by F. Treloar and carried.
