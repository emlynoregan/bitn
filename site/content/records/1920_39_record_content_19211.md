Redruth Methodist Ladies Guild

The inaugural gathering of the guild was on Tuesday 13 April.  President Mrs H. Alvey and Vice-President Mrs H.H. Thomas.  [The President proceeded to read the first annual report, so this was actually the first AGM rather than the first meeting.]

The report says the guild was formed the previous April with 8 members and met on the fourth Wednesday each month.  The Guild became responsible for church flowers and very substantial parcels of clothing have been sent to the Central Methodist Mission and old linen to the Burra Hospital.  A social and strawberry fete and Christmas tree were held to raise funds for alterations to the pulpit and choir platform.  £114 was raised.  The Guild will refurnish and recarpet that part of the church when the work is done.  The church properties have a debt of £600 and the guild will work over the year to reduce that.

Mr & Mrs Tom Tiver were farewelled by Redruth Methodist Ladies Guild on 13 April.
