Theft.  On 9 March 1963 Burra Dry Cleaners were broken into and a cash box among other things was stolen.  Now, when the garden block of the late Luke Day was being levelled, the box has been discovered.  It contained various papers and the war service medals of Mr Williams, but not the £7 in silver it had originally held.  Also in the box was a silver medallion inscribed ‘Best Player in Star Football Club 21/9/09’ on one side and the initials L.H. on the other.  It was probably removed from clothing left for dry cleaning and placed in the box for safe keeping.
