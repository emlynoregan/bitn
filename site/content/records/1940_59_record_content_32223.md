Burra Ratepayers’ Meeting, 30 June

The Mayor thanked ratepayers for re-electing him unopposed.  The Council was going through a tough post war time with rising wages and shortages of materials.  The Local Government Association advised that working costs had risen by 40% since 1939.  Last year the rates had been increased by only 2d and that had been earmarked for the Town Hall.  As a result Council finances had drifted further and without an increase in rates services would have to be curtailed.  The Mayor then read some estimates of the differences in costs between 1945-46 and 1946-47: Health £287 & £328, Administration £452 & £542, Parklands £63 & £58, Cemetery £117 & £132, Fire brigade £88 & £117.  The total amounted to £2589-10-11 for 1945-46 and £2594-12-9 for 1946-47.

[This hardly seems a sufficient difference following the figures stated.]

The total income for the first period was £2129-10-10 and for the second £2198-15-7.
