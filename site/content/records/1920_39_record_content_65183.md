 There were also falls in the agricultural areas.  A.F. McDonald near Hallett reports 120 points.  G.S. Nourse at ‘Melton Park’ Mt Bryan got 110 points in three showers.  Hanson received a downpour and Clem Bailey reports over 2 inches as a result.  Falls of around 2 inches are also reported from World’s End where the downpour caused local flooding and carried away much fencing.  Burra recorded just 14 points.
