Street Names.  It has been decided that street names will be installed as far as possible on existing posts.  [Whether vertically or horizontally is not clear from the report.  Cr Baulderstone favoured low down and vertical, but Cr Woollacottâ€™s motion was carried and it (at least as reported) seems not to indicate how the names are to run.]
