Redruth News, 8 January

The Christmas-New Year season saw few festivities this year.  The only public amusements were provided by Rev. L.W. Stanton, assisted by other ladies and gentlemen.  (Readings, songs and music.)

Though there are but few farmers in the immediate district, those have had a good year.  On the new land taken up at Gum Creek, Mr Bryan Flat, Springbank Flat, the Little Plain, Tothill’s Creek and Springbank, the yields are about 23 bushels per acre and on old land about 20 bushels.  It is a matter of regret that so little land about the neighbourhood is under cultivation and it is to be hoped that soon the plains around will be dotted with farmers’ homesteads.  The haystacks of Cobb & Co.’s paddocks are a splendid example of what Burra land will produce.

The Local Court heard a cross-information case today in which Mrs Hodge and Mrs Vincent accused each other of assault over some misunderstanding about a fowl.  Mrs Hodge swore Mrs Vincent threw a stone at her and then ran and pulled her to the ground and assaulted her for ten minutes.  She appeared, however, to have escaped serious injury.  Mrs Vincent on the other hand was black all around the eyes, her eyes were bloodshot, her cheeks were black and blue and her limbs were stiff.  She described how Mrs Hodge had pulled her to the ground, taken her head in both hands and bumped it hard on the ground and then knelt on her stomach and with both hands battered her eyes.  Witnesses supported Mrs Vincent.  The parties were bound over to a Local Court of Full Jurisdiction on 30 January.

In a case of animal cruelty Joseph Williams was sentenced to 30 days in gaol.  Mr Woollacott engaged him to drive two teams of bullocks from Pichi Richi to Burra, in company with Woollacott’s son, aged 14.

[This would appear to be William John Woollacott born 9 June 1852 and so 15 in the latter half of 1867.]

No time was specified, but eight days was mentioned.  Williams did the journey in four days, but Mr Woollacott said it crippled the bullocks, making them useless for months.  Williams blamed the boy for urging him on, but the lad denied it positively and swore that Williams had charge of the teams.
