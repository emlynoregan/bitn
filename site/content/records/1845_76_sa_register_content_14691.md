Kooringa News, 26 June

The first anniversary of the new Bible Christian Chapel was celebrated last Sunday.  Sermons were preached by Mrs Roberts and in the afternoon by Rev. J.D. Whittaker.  The building was filled to overflowing on each occasion.  On Monday a tea meeting was held in the old chapel, where more than 300 enjoyed ‘the cup that cheers, but not inebriates’.

Monday was a public holiday as mid-summer’s day (or rather mid-winter’s day).  There was a dinner commemorating the anniversary of the Miners & Tradesmen’s Club.  The Masonic Lodge also held a dinner and the following day saw the opening of the new Redruth Bridge.  The work for this was commenced on 25 January and work proceeded steadily except on one occasion when workmen had to wait for the delivery of material.  It is constructed on the laminated arch principle and has a span of 68 ft 6 inches, being built askew so that the span on the square is 60 ft.  The abutments and wing walls are of coarse hammer-dressed rubble masonry.  From these spring four laminated arches or ribs, bearing a framed wooden superstructure, surmounted by the roadway, which is formed of two transverse thicknesses of three-inch gum planking laid diagonally.  The side rails are of white painted deal.  The whole reflects great credit on the builders; Messrs Burgoyne & Baker for the carpentry and Messrs Tiver and Cole for the masonry.  I understand the cost is £1,400.  The only drawback is the approaches, the fences of which are but rough post and rail in contrast to the finished workmanship of the bridge itself.  The bridge has been available for use by the public since 6 June, though the official opening was not performed till the 25 June.  The appointed time for the ceremony was 2 p.m., but a sharp shower delayed it somewhat.  Soon, however, ‘two wagons from the Smelting Works, loaded with copper ore from the mine, took up their station on and near the bridge, followed by a train of vehicles and horsemen.  A carriage then drove up, containing Mr W.H. Challoner and Mr., Mrs and Miss Barker, who was the lady appointed to perform the ceremony.  Mr. Challoner having led up Miss Barker, she was introduced by Mr. Burgoyne, who then handed her a gaily-decked bottle of wine, which she smashed on the rail, naming the bridge “The Redruth Bridge.”’

Cheers were then given and Mr Barker, on behalf of Mr A. Macaulay, District Surveyor, who was unavoidably absent, declared the bridge open to the public.

About 50 attended the following dinner at the Aberdeen Hotel, though the absence of the music usual for such occasions rendered portions of the event somewhat tame and flat.  Some excellent songs did enliven the toasts.
