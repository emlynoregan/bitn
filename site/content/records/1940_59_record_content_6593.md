The Column ‘Burra Goes to Town’ was a feature recounting gossipy type information about Burra residents or former residents and connection now in Adelaide (or elsewhere).  Generally this has not been noted, but occasional items have been included.  It is of interest to note that quite frequently references are made to former residents now involved in war related work in the city.  In this issue for instance it is said that Mr H.F. Saunders is working at Holden’s munition works.  Miss Peg Thomas late governess at ‘The Gums’ is doing clerical work in connection with probable evacuees.  Mr G. Phillips late AMP at Burra is doing staff work at Keswick [Army base].

Murray Pens, late of Florieton is working at LCL Alkali Works at Osborne.
