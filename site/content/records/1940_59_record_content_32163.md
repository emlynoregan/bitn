Burra Jubilee Benevolent Society

There are 11 financial members and six or seven are active.  Monthly meetings are held in the Town Hall Lodge Room.  Donations of money and clothing etc. are distributed to the needy.  Firewood in winter is in demand and Christmas cheer is a traditional service.  Members will miss the visit to Mrs Klaffus on her birthday on 27 August, as she passed away this year aged 100.  The society obtained a self-propelled wheelchair for Mr Lomman.  The Chairman, Rev. A.S. Barrett, was a tower of strength till his transfer to Quorn.  We welcome Rev. Hobbs as his replacement.  Captain Cox of the Salvation Army was also a great worker, but has now left the district.
