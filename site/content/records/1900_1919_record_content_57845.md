Tar Paving has proved both sound and economical when done properly.  We look forward to a time when all the main roads will be paved.  In February a move was made to do all of Market Square and storekeepers promised 17 casks of tar towards this.  The work was not done due to a dispute over which ward should carry out the work.  I urged it be done at the expense of the whole town.  In the near future I hope to see the present enclosure enlarged to house a memorial to the brave boys who have made the supreme sacrifice in the Great War â€“ after which tarring can be completed.
