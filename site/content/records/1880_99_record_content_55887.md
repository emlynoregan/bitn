Editorial on ‘More Hankey Pankeys’.

The editorial revisits the last Town Council meeting and says that while in committee Cr Sampson told the guilty Councillors what he thought of them, but at first Crs Harris and Rabbich persisted.  Crs Sampson and West then signified their intent of leaving the chamber.  The junior North Ward Councillor then moved the doors be opened. And eventually this was agreed to, whereupon Cr Harris left, leaving four Councillors to conduct the business.  Until recently we did not have any idea of why Cr Harris behaved in this way.  We now hear he did not wish to have ‘every little twiddle-twaddle reported’.  If he would keep the twiddle-twaddle within himself he would have no need to be ashamed of what was reported.  There is further trouble ahead and if Councillors are not careful they will be plunged into difficulties.
