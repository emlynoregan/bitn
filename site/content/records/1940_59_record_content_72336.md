Burra Swimming Pool

The Mayor E.T. Baulderstone and the Chairman of the District Council Mr M. de N. Lucas have both endorsed the building of the pool.  Each has contributed £5 to start the subscription list.  Last week a deputation from the committee asked the council to consider two questions:

Will the Council apply for a Government subsidy of £1,500?

Will the Council approve the site selected by the committee for the pool?

On the subsidy issue Mr R. Jeffery tables the necessary information obtained from the SA Government Tourist Bureau, which handles such matters.  The town stands to gain a £3,000 asset for £1,500.

The committee guarantees not to draw on any of the subsidy until both it and the Council are sure the project can be completed.  Mr Topsfield spoke on the question of a site.  He said they had held negotiations with the Minister for the Army about the use of the Drill Hall site with its buildings and the Minister of Defence, Sir Philip McBride, has indicated he is interested in the proposal and will contact the Minister for the Army about the proposal.  If this site were freed it would save about half the cost of the proposal, but the committee asked the Council to approve the playground site, if the Drill Hall is not released.  The playground site has advantages for water supply, centrality, good access to schools and for tourists and for the beautification of that part of the town.

The Councillors said they were favourably impressed with the proposal and would inspect the area at an early date and indicated a favourable response was likely.

[The response of the Tourist Bureau to questions put are printed and essentially they said the Government subsidy had to be paid through a local Government body, but did not require a formal guarantee and could be paid in instalments as work proceeded, though that was not their preferred option, because in the unlikely event that the project was not completed, the subsidy would have to be refunded., which was of course an argument against drawing upon the subsidy in instalments.]

Voluntary labour could be valued for the purpose of calculating the subsidy.  The maximum Government contribution would be £1,500.

A subscription list has been established and donations will be acknowledged in the Burra Record.  Investigations into the old [pre-WWII] subscriptions showed that about £184 had been subscribed and of this about £60 had been expended in plans etc. leaving about £112, which was held in trust by the Burra Town Council and with interest had grown to c. £180.

Some people thought the sum placed in trust was c. £400, but they be confused with the Centenary Celebrations Fund, which was about that amount.
