Mt Bryan East Methodist Church celebrated the 25th anniversary of the opening of the building.  Twenty-five years ago the Mt Bryan East Church was in bad repair and it was decided to demolish it and rebuild in a more central location.  This was done.  Rev. F.W. Brasher put in considerable time to help the demolition.  The foundation stone was laid on 16 November 1912 by Rev. W.H. Cann then President of the Methodist Conference of SA.  Rev. Basher was invited back for the anniversary service and he came from his West Hindmarsh circuit and delivered two sermons.
