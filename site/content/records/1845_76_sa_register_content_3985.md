The Far Famed Burra Burra Mine

On the 17 October the Directors of the SA Mining Association held their 9th half-yearly meeting.  We deem it necessary to explain to recent arrivals why the report and associated documents do not appear in our advertising columns.

In September 1849 the Directors not only declared a repetition of those 200% dividends which had astounded colonists and electrified people in distant climes, but declared their ability to maintain these returns to the tune of 800% p.a.  We, being in possession of some very intelligible financial rumours we did not hesitate to put the several parties concerned upon their guard.  Firstly those officially responsible and those who stood possessed a strong pecuniary interest in Burra Burra affairs.  Secondly those who intended to become deeply interested in the mine and received as commercially orthodox every favourable report and believed everything that tended to exalt the renowned Burra Burra.  Thirdly those plodding colonists who were in danger of being induced to desert their desks and counters to rush to the ‘copper-field’ in the Californian manner.  And lastly those practical miners to whom we are so much indebted and who had been offered such inducements to leave their British homes in order to be come free and liberally remunerated labourers in SA, and whose legitimate earnings we feared would be improperly interfered with in the over-weening desire of the Directors to continue the payments of such preposterously large dividends.

The Directors grew so wrathful with us that they stopped their advertisements in this paper.  They also commenced nine actions-at-law against us.

The fate of the nine actions is well known.  Subsequent events and developments have shown that we were right.  Legal engines have ceased to assail us and a calm has settled over the troubled waters.

Though still no advertisements come our way.

The SA Mining Association was established on 16 April 1845.  The capital stock originally subscribed and paid up was £12,320 and so successful has the venture been that no further call has been made for funds.

The Burra Burra Mines were opened on the 29 September 1845 and the era of their astonishing productiveness may be dated from the following day.  Between 30 Sept 1845 and 30 September 1846 more than 6,359 tons of copper ore was raised and in the time to 29 September last the quantity produced has exceeded 37,735 tons.

Of this 18,567 tons realised an average of £14-10-3 clear of freight and charges and taking the whole produce of the mine at this rate, we should have the enormous product of £547,629-3-9.  However, prices in the British copper ore market in the last six months have fluctuated to the extent of £3 per ton and so this calculation will not hold up.  Nevertheless, the Burra Burra Mines to 29 September 1849 will be found to have realised a sum largely exceeding half a million pounds sterling, clear of freight and charges.

These returns have either already been obtained or are forthcoming from the (colonial) Patent Copper Co., to whom have been delivered copper ores exceeding 2,466 tons.

Against the cooper ores so delivered the Sa Mining Association has, in possession, reversion, or expectancy, sums amounting to £23,244-7-2, so that after allowing for £286-3-6 for the carriage of metallic copper from the Patent Copper Company’s works, the Association realises £5,000 more than if they had been sent to Swansea or any other copper market or smelter in Britain.

This result is an important feature of the Associations prosperity.  Although the ores sent to the Patent Copper Company do not have the greatest percentage of copper, they give a nett return to the Association of £9-6-8 per ton.  The richer ores sent to Swansea and elsewhere in Britain did not nett more than an average £7-6-1 per ton at the mines.

The dividend paid on 5 October was 100% and the Directors have expressed a hope that nothing will prevent a continuation of such dividends.  The whole of the dividends paid amounting to £135,520 represents 1,100% on the capital originally subscribed and have been paid from the actual profits realized from the working of the Mine from 29 September 1845 to 31 December 1947; a period of 27 months.

Independent of any mineral estate, the Association has lands, tenements, buildings, mining plant etc. giving a nett receivable surplus of £43,904-19-8 available for future dividends.

The Association’s establishment at the Burra Burra Mine (including 16 officers and two surgeons) is 726 persons and this is expected to increase considerably as a result of the operation of their powerful steam engine from today.  The population of the Township of Kooringa already exceeds 4,000.

The 30 fathom level is the deepest mentioned in Captain Roach’s report.  He expects from seven pitches at this level to produce 500 tons in a ‘take’ of six weeks.  In one lode he reports driving through oxide and malachite varying in length from one to eight fathoms with ore varying from 40-48%.

At the half-yearly meeting the services of the office-bearers was thankfully acknowledged.

C.S. Penny was elected to a vacant seat among the Directors.

Mr Brown unsuccessfully that the opinion of counsel be sought as to the practicability of dividing the £5 shares into five £1 shares and of opening an office in London for the transfer of shares and the payment of dividends to proprietors resident in England.  Mr Stocks Jnr seconded the first part of this proposal, but not the latter part because he wished to see the property confined as much as possible to residents of SA.   Mr C.S. Penny seconded the proposal for a London office.  Mr Peacock was opposed to any change.  The proposal failed.
