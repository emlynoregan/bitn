Obituary. August Frederick William Pohlner was born at Angaston on 5 June 1858.  As a youth he travelled sheep on his father’s property or took the herd to Bethany in the Tanunda Hills, now known as Mt Kitchener.  He received very little schooling.  He went to Hallett 76 years ago and pioneered the surrounding country.  In the early days the land was unfenced and he employed shepherds.  The sheep were yarded every night behind brush fences because of the menace of wild dogs.  He married Clara Brady of Mt Bryan just over 58 years ago.  The family comprised six sons and four daughters.  Two children predeceased their father.  Three sons enlisted in WWI and two served in WWII.  There are fourteen grandchildren.  Mr Pohlner died peacefully at Burra Hospital on 2 August after a very brief illness.  He was physically strong, mentally alert and enjoyed wonderful health almost to the last day of his life.  It had been 38 years since his last time in hospital and sixty years ago suffered a severe heat stroke.

In his younger days he was a very hard worker and his interests were solely in farming and grazing.  He was fond of horses and was a great horseman.  He worked until the last day before his final illness, inspecting a dam, attending to his sheep and repairing a fence.  That was the last occasion he drove his car.  Last year he drove some friends to the Angaston Centenary Celebrations.  Although he could neither read nor write, Mr Pohlner was a shrewd businessman and the last cheque he signed was for the United Nations Appeal for Children.  He helped others in a quiet way and would never leave a man in trouble.  Many years ago he had been a member of the Hallett District Council and was the oldest member of the Foresters’ Lodge in Burra.

[Born Friederich Wilhelm August Pohlner 5 June 1858 at Angas Park: died as August Frederick Wilhelm Pohlner 2 August 1948, Burra, residence Tooralie.]
