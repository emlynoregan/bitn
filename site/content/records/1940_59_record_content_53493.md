Galahs.  The District Clerk, Mr F.N. Fabian, has received several reports of considerable damage done by galahs.  Huge flocks are the result of increases in recent years and all types of crops suffer.  Robertstown also reports problems and landowners who poisoned them there then suffered from polluted water when their bodies ended up in dams and troughs.  Poisoned oats is effective, but sheep and other stock can be endangered.  Shooting is too expensive.  The matter will be raised at the next Mid-North Local Government Assoc. meeting.

Burra Hospital costs have been investigated and are reported to compare favourably with other hospitals of a similar size.
