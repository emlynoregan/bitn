Henry Pether.  The late Mr Pether was a printer by trade and had been employed by the Kapunda Herald and the SA Advertiser and when in 1876 F.W. Holder called for the establishment of a local paper in the then flourishing Burra Parliamentary Club, he was appointed to establish the Northern Mail in partnership with Mr F. Jarman.  This became the Burra News and is now the Burra Record, having passed from Mr Pether nearly two years ago.  Mr Pether took up farming at Mongolata, but was driven from there by a series of bad years and returned to printing.  His death was sudden.  It was only two weeks ago that he complained of a cold.  He leaves a wife and several children.
