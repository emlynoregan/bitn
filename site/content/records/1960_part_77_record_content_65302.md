The dominant item for the year was Peacock’s chimney.  Last year the stonework had been completed and the brick top begun.  After months of frustratingly slow progress the brickwork was topped, but so badly executed as to be totally unacceptable.  Eventually the contractor agreed and the brickwork was removed.  Before rebuilding commenced the contractor went bankrupt.  The services were then obtained of O’Neill & Clayton, who did a first class job.  Sir Mark Oliphant unveiled the plaque [at the completed chimney] on 8 October 1972.  In the year visits were made to Tanunda and Renmark branches.  Jamestown has given us a complete railway signal tower and signal.
