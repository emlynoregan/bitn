The Mayor said the agreement submitted by Mr Lewis was totally different.

Mr Winnall will be asked to draw up an agreement in line with the above clause and submit it to Council for approval and inform Bright & Bright that this was being done.

It was pointed out that this did not give Bagot, Shakes & Lewis the sole right of way along the creek.
