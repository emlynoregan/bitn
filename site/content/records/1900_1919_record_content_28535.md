Burra Primary School broke up on 22 December, but few parents attended due to the very rough weather.  Mr Scott the headmaster expects to be transferred from Burra and Miss Grosser on the staff has gained her BA.  [Personal interest: attending every day for 1910 were Maurice and Norman Fuss.  The prize for perseverance in 5th Class went to Manville Fuss, but this seems likely to be a mistake for Maurice Fuss.]
