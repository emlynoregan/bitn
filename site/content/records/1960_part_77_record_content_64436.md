Characteristics of the 1972 paper.

There was quite a reasonable coverage of local issues and with a fairly wide interpretation of ‘local’; ranging from Saddleworth to Hallett and Robertstown.

There are quite a few mistakes in setting, however, and not all are subsequently corrected, which leaves some puzzling items.  Some of the major news items are general interest, rather than local.

Allocation of material to pages is rather elastic, but the following is typical.

Page 1.

Solidly devoted to news.

Page 2.

Some large local advertisements with sports results,

Sales notices and public notices are sometimes here and sometimes on page 6 or split between the two.

Page 3.

Typically a heavy dose of large advertisements with perhaps one column of news.

Pages 4 & 5.

Generally little news except for sports results and often a large section of 50 and 25 years ago.

Page 6.

Large advertisements for about half the page.  The Cash Column (small classified advertisements) for at least one column.  Some public notices and other small advertisements.

Page 7.

‘Out and About’ – small snippets of local news.

Further local news and sports.  At least half a page of advertising.

Page. 8

Large advertisements for about four columns.  Reports from various District Councils and perhaps some other news.
