Notice.  Burra Town Council has appointed Arthur John Holness keeper of the public pound at Burra in place of M. Kellaway, deceased.  [CHECK: This seems to be Mary Kellaway who died on 10 March and was the wife of Stanley Kellaway.  But which Stanley Kellaway?  This does not accord with the database.]
