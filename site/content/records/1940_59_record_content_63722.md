First edition under E.E. & R.E. Angel

The Governor Sir Robert George & Lady George were in Burra on 25 May and were given a civic luncheon at the Kooringa Hotel [those present are listed] and then a civic reception at the Town Hall.  Whilst here they were the guests of Mr & Mrs Andrew Tennant at Princess Royal.  On Tuesday morning they inspected stud stock at A.L. Collins’s property at Mt Bryan.  In the afternoon the Governor visited Burra Primary and High Schools and after inspecting the classrooms the Governor addressed the assembled students, together with those from St Joseph’s Convent.

Lady George was meanwhile entertained by the ladies’ organisations in the town. Sir Robert and Lady George then visited the hospital.  Back at Princess Royal Sir Robert turned his hand to water divining and the rod also acted in the hands of Lady George.  In the evening Sir Robert attended Burra RSL Club where G. Stanley Hawker introduced the Sub-Branch President, C.H. Griffen and Vice-Presidents, V.A. Riggs and H. Cornelius as well as Secretary, J. Sorrell.

Burra Hospital received the Coronation Gift Humid Crib on 24 May in an attempt to save the life of a premature baby born that day, but the child lived only 20 hours.  Lameroo and Maitland later received two other humid cribs.  [Obituary: Paul Kemble son of George Kemble of Burra died 25 May 1954 aged 20 hours.]
