The National Trust in Burra sponsored a workshop on tourism on Thursday night.  It was addressed by two representatives from the SA Tourism Commission.  Ideas floated included adding food and drink stops to the Passport Trail and devising trail with different interests, such as artists and food & wine and an evening walking tour.  Ideas were discussed to attract more visitors in the slow months of January and February.  Ways of encouraging coaches to visit Burra are needed as well as ways to encourage longer stays.
