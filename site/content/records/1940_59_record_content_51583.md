Burra Town Council, 6 August

Council will visit the site of the proposed CWA avenue of trees on 7 August.

Matters arising from the discussion between the Burra Electric Supply Co. and the Council were discussed in committee.

The grant-in-aid for 1951-52 will be Â£441.

L.L. Fiebig asked that the property in Burra North, [which he wished to convert to a service station] be condemned as unfit for habitation.

There will be no further action on this until a report is received from the Health Inspector.

The Burra & District War Memorial Committee asked Council to give consideration to enlarging Victoria Park by closing roads on the north, east and south sides.

Council decided to take the initial steps to do this.

Burra Cold Stores was given permission to alter their shop front.

Davies Motor Co. was given permission to erect and extend an existing workshop at the rear of the Eastern Telephone Building.

Burra Electric Supply Co. was asked to take more care and not leaves holes for poles uncovered at night [as had recently been done in Queen Street.]
