Birds Shot in Burra

A few days before Christmas numerous birds were shot in one part of Burra.  Many were killed, but others were maimed and left to die a slow and painful death.  It is an offence to discharge a firearm within township areas and also a criminal offence to injure animals in such a way under the Animal Welfare Act of 1985.  If anyone has information, contact the police of the RSPCA.
