Princess Royal Feedlot

Early in 2005 Goyder Council approved a proposal by Simon Rowe for a feedlot on Princess Royal.

Mr Whetstone and Mr Lindner lodged an objection and subsequently appealed to the ERDC.

The ERDC overturned the Council’s approval on the grounds that the feedlot could threaten water resources from pollution or excessive use.

Mr Rowe held that these findings were inconsistent and had no solid foundation or evidence.  It focused on the risk the development might have on the water course as a resource.  The decision relied, he said, on anecdotal evidence of ground water levels and creek flow and not on evidence from observation wells.  The ERDC said the site itself was an appropriate land use and a feedlot would not cause a nuisance by reason of dust, noise and appearance and arrangements for run-off and disposal of waste were satisfactory and were unlikely to pollute ground or surface water.

Mr Whetstone cited the feedlot in Clare, where more than 5,000 cattle resulted in creek pollution and smell.  He was not against a feedlot; the issue was its location.

It is understood that prior to an application being lodges, a feedlot was up and running and according to Goyder Council planner, Mr John Brak, it was a case of processing the application as soon as possible.

The latest judgement in the case, in response to Mr Rowe’s second appeal has again rejected the application on the grounds that water use from the Burra Creek is unsustainable.
