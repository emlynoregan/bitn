W.H. Hardy has received news of a splendid gold find at Algebuckina Goldfields c. 30 miles south of Oodnadatta and he is seeking those who would form a small syndicate of c. £15 to £20 to meet the cost of placing him on the ground for 2-3 months work at what he is confident will be a payable thing.
