The Burra Show is to be held on Saturday 11 October.

This Jubilee Year Show, the society’s 109th, is to be a memorable one.

[This was not the 109th Burra Show.  The correct figure cannot be obtained by subtracting 1877 from the present year.  The first Show was held in 1877, but there were no shows from 1886 to 1893, apparently due to apathy, which provoked considerable comment in the local paper at the time.  The 1897 Show was cancelled due to the appallingly bad season and the 1914 Show was cancelled due to the combined effects of the outbreak of World War I and a devastating drought.  (The event returned in 1915.)  Twenty-five years of Shows from 1915-39 ended in 1940 when the Show was cancelled due to World War II.  The Show remained suspended until 1946, since when it has been an annual event.]

Special features for 1986:

Jim Kelly of Naracoorte and his bullocks

Blade and mechanical shearing competition and display of historic handpieces by Frank Doeke

Sammy & Samantha Seagull

Paul O’Bryan’s Band

Elders will show an historic film of a Burra Market sheep sale

Elders will arrange for a display from the shoe On the Sheep’s Back to come to Burra.
