Burra Burra Show Inc.  The committee has obtained the services of K.R. Crewes as secretary.

It has been decided to erect new sheep yards in cyclone wire and timber, in a different position.  These will eventually be roofed by iron from the eastern part of the fence, which will in turn be replaced by a cyclone fence.
