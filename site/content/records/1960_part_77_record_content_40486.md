Weather.  This season has had a pattern of weekly rains, which are hampering seeding operations, but benefiting pastures, filling surface catchments and replenishing aquifers.  Wheat already sown is doing well.  Some areas are suffering lucerne flea or mite.  Roads have suffered damage and streams are generally flowing.  Falls in the last week have been between 50 and 100 points generally.  Burra recorded 75 points.  [There is an extended summary of seasonal conditions.]

Burra Rural Youth held a trading table and contest in miserably wet and cold conditions and managed to raise $64 for Kathryn Whiteâ€™s entry in the Miss Industry Quest.

Members had a tour of the Clarevale Winery on the evening of 17 June.

Golf.  Children are annoying golfers at Burra by darting out and retrieving balls that are in play.  There is also a danger of their being hit.  [The suggestion was that they were unsupervised children of parents attending adjacent football games.]

Marrabel Catholic Church [of St Agnes] will celebrate it centenary with a service on 30 June, when Archbishop Gleeson will officiate.  [A brief history of the church is printed.]

Red Cross held a gold day at Burra and raised $53 for the cause.
