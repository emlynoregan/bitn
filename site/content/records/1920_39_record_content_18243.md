Burra District Council

Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. to be written to concerning the renting of a portion of their yards as a public pound in common with the Burra Town Council.

One monthâ€™s notice was given to all those with commonage stock on a stock road to remove same.

Salvation Army.  Ensign & Mrs Peek, after 12 months in charge, leave on Thursday for Moonta and were given a farewell on Monday evening.  Rev. Lee spoke in support of the work of the Army, but believed their policy of moving officers so often was not wise and an officer no sooner got into his stride than he was moved before he could see the virtue of his work.  Ensign Peek said he was glad he had been able to renovate the building (the third he had done in three years), as it meant his successor would be able to concentrate fully on the work.
