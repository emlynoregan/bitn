Obituary.  Marlene Kay Burton 30 January 1944 to 15 December 1993.

Mrs Burton died as the result of a traffic accident when struck by a car while a pedestrian on South Road at Black Forest last Wednesday.  She leaves a husband, Jack, and four children.  Mrs Burton was born in Adelaide and lived in Mt Bryan with her husband.  With farming, shearing and bee-keeping, they built a house for their family.  Their elder daughter, Darylee, is a double certificated nurse.  She and her husband, Garry Pelletier, returned to Adelaide last year from Hawaii, where they had lived since their marriage.

In November this year their elder son, Wayne, completed a degree at Adelaide University in Agricultural Science and is employed as a Research officer at Minnipa on Eyre Peninsula.  He hopes to go on to complete his PhD.  Younger son, Danny, has attended Norwood senior High School for the last two years and has just completed Matriculation.  He hopes to go on to tertiary studies in business or physiotherapy.  Daughter Julie completed her studies at BCS in 1990 and has been living for two years in England.  Accompanied by John Mackenzie from Kent, she returned to Mt Bryan to spend Christmas with her family just a week before her mother died.

Arian Garret in giving the Eulogy for Marlene described her as a most caring and generous person who was talented and participated vigorously in family and community life.  She was well known and respected throughout the district.  For many years she drove the school bus on the Hallett-Burra run.  She was dedicated to planting trees in the district and the people of Mt Bryan are arranging for a grove of trees to be named in her honour as a dedication to her commitment to Greening Australia.  These trees and the many she planted will be a lasting memorial to Mrs Burton.
