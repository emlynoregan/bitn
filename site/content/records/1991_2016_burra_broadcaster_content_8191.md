Back to St Joseph’s Burra School

The Back to Burra Schools Weekend is less than two weeks away.

The St Joseph’s School ran from 1871 to1970 and was situated behind the Catholic Church on Mt Pleasant Road.  It is now the Parish Centre.  On Sunday 22 October there will be a display of memorabilia of the recently sainted Mary MacKillop.
