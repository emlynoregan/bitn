The Burra Mine.  We understand that on arrival in Europe Mr Darlington wasted no time in giving instructions for the manufacture of the dressing apparatus to be used under the intended arrangement for removing the ore by means of open workings.  The whole of the ore on hand has been disposed of to the E & A Copper Co.  100 tons of copper have been exported to England for sale since last September and about 204 tons remain on hand.  The loss on the workings of the mine since September 1866 has been £10,833-19-6, including the cost of sinking Graves’ Shaft from the 20 fathom to 50 fathom level, the erection of the engine house and other outlay to the benefit of future workings.  A sum of £61,000 has been transferred from stock account arising from previous profits to meet this loss and that on purchasing and working the Karkulto Mine, leaving a balance to the credit of the profit and loss account of £32,761-1-10.  The debits include the subscribed capital of £12,320; balance of stock account, £49,280; forming together £61,600, the amount of the proposed capital for the future, besides £32,761-1-10as the credit of profit and loss, and £827-1-2 due to sundry creditors.  The credits, estimated at £95,188-3-0 include the value of fixed property, machining plant, stores, unsold copper, sundry debtors and cash.  Mr Darlington is believed to have secured the services of a competent agent, who is expected to arrive shortly to supervise the operations under the new system.
