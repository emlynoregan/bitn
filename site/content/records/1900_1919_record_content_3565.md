H.W. Collins sued J. Harris for travelling through his property on a stock route without notice.  As Harris had been doing this for years without complaint from Collins, it was suggested the case resulted from some disagreement between the two.  Mr Pendlebury, for Harris, managed to show the route was a public road and had been maintained, at least in part, by the DC.  Collins was unable to prove ownership of the land and ended up having to pay Â£2-16-0 costs to Harris.
