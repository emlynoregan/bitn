Silverton Railway.

A large and enthusiastic meeting was held at the Institute on Wednesday last chaired by Dr Brummitt. (Mayor).

A meeting in January, he said, had formed a committee to push for a survey of a direct line from Burra to the Barrier.  On 8 February Mr Rounsevell wrote that such a survey was promised and indeed a surveyor had arrived to commence the task, but had been recalled.  When the survey from Terowie was announced he had written again to Mr Rounsevell and received an assurance that the Burra survey would not be overlooked.  Dr Cockburn has since said a report will be obtained re the cost of getting through the ranges east of Burra.

John Dunstan jun. JP moved a lengthy motion calling for the construction of a railway on the shorter route via Burra.  The Government’s decision to go via Petersburg was hasty and against the best interests of the colony.  He developed an argument favouring Port Adelaide over Pt Pirie and other ports, bringing Adelaide nearer to NSW and opening up access to 2,560,000 acres of SA territory and then turned to Burra’s unlimited water supply ‘which is the best on the line for locomotive purposes’.  If the line goes via Petersburg water trains will have to run an additional 62 miles in dry seasons.

W.F. Coglin seconded the motion, which passed unanimously.
