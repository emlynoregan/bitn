Goyder Council will have to change the structure of its Development Assessment Panels, following recent amendments to legislation.  They expect it to raise significant problems.  The panels will now have seven members and one independent chairperson.  The aim is to make decisions more efficient.  The panels are to have fewer than half elected members, with an equal number of independent experts and an independent member as Presiding Member.  Council Planner, John Brak expected finding three independent specialist members for the panels might prove difficult.  Goyder Council held that the existing practice of five elected members and three community members as independents or specialists was working well.
