The Editor writes re the letter last week from the couple from Newcastle.  He is suspicious that they found the same problem at virtually every place they visited and wonders if anything or anyone could have satisfied them.  His experience is that ‘there is little to grumble about in Burra – the town is a heritage mecca and the people are genuinely very friendly’.
