Burra Girls citizens Clubs (YWCA)

The Aberdeen Club has been going for some time, but the Kooringa one only this year.  Last weekend the clubs met in one big gathering and Kooringa Girl Citizens were formally enrolled and initiated at the Redruth Memorial Hall.  The initiation was conducted at a service in the Redruth Church and Miss R. Bachelor was received as Counsellor.  Miss Welbourne from Adelaide gave the address ‘Play the Game’.  There was a Sunday Church Parade at Kooringa Methodist Church.  Rev. F.J. Barnes of Redruth preached at a community service in the evening when Mrs W. Hutley from Adelaide took charge.  On Monday evening the girls staged an entertainment for women and girls to raise money to relieve unemployment distress.  £5 was raised by voluntary donation.
