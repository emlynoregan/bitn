War News.  Preparations for war [i.e. with Russia] continue in England with a squadron preparing for the Baltic.  A British army of 50,000 is already advancing. [Presumably in Afghanistan]

NSW troops head for the front in Sudan while England buys cruisers and bids for a Turkish alliance and Russia masses troops in the Caucasus.
