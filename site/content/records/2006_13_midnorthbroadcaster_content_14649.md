Phoenix Copper reports excellent drilling results at its highly prospective Burra North Tenement.  This follows a five-hole drilling program only 800 metres from the famous Monster Mine.  Copper at 1.17% was found over 22 metres from 94 metres and there were areas of 7.92% and 4.73%.  CEO James Fox says the results represent a major boost for the company, which will continue to work in a highly significant and yet under-explored area.  These results provide a focus for exploration of the Monster Mine copper lode beyond the Reserve where mining is currently prohibited.

Adelaide based Phoenix Copper listed on the Australian Securities Exchange in February 2008 and is focused on the discovery of copper and gold within its 4,200 km2 exploration licence holding in SA.  This includes the Burra Region and Yorke Peninsula, where it is currently conducting exploration drilling at its Minlaton project with two drilling rigs in operation.
