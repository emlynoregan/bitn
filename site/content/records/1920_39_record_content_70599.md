Obituary.  Edgar Tiver of Hallett died 12 April after a long illness.  He was the second son of the late Mr & Mrs James Tiver and was educated first at Mr White’s private school and then at the Burra Model School and Prince Alfred College.  He later worked at the family store in Aberdeen now occupied by Messrs Sara & Co.  When quite young he left the store for Broken Hill and worked in a leading business there.  He also joined the Volunteer Fire Brigade there and helped fight the big Argent St fire of 5 November 1889.  Later still he went to Peterborough and joined the SAR as a signalman, working at various sidings on the Broken Hill line ending up at Oodlawirra in 1895 when he married Gertrude B. Goss, eldest daughter of the late Mr & Mrs Isaac Goss formerly of Aberdeen.  He resigned from SAR in 1904 and joined James Tiver & Sons which owned the Aberdeen store and also pastoral country.  From then on he lived in the Hallett district where he was a farmer and grazier.  As a young man he was a keen cricketer and he was a staunch Methodist holding most lay positions at some time including Sunday school superintendent at Oodlawirra, local preacher and circuit steward.  He is survived by a widow, two sons and five daughters: Mrs W.E. Hogan (Hallett), Mrs R.S. Honan (Hallett), Mrs F.T. Reed (Peterborough), Mrs P.M. Thomas (Clare), Mrs H.N. Thomas (Reeve’s Plains), Mr N.G. Tiver (Hallett) & Mr R.K. Tiver (Hallett).  There are 14 grandchildren.  Also survived by three sisters and four brothers: Mrs J.G. Sara (Aberdeen), Mrs A. Sara (Glenelg), Mrs A.J. Stock, Mr Charles Tiver (Glenelg), Mr George Tiver (Hallett), Mr Harry Tiver (Crystal Brook) & Mr Harold Tiver (Aberdeen).  [Born 12 October 1866.]
