Mr Miller [Giles Miller who died 1932 aged 89] who will be 83 in March was at the last Elder, Smith sale in Burra.  He lives in retirement at Hallett.  He was born in Hutt St Adelaide and at 21 came to Burra with his father as a carter for the Mine.  He took a small selection known as Camel’s Hump and later went to Blinman for two years carting ore from the mine there.  Later he took land at Wonna and finally a farm at Leighton where he stayed for 30 years before retiring.  In early days he helped his father moved Dr Browne’s goods and chattels from Booborowie to Buckland Park (Pt Gawler), returning with timber from Pt Adelaide to build the Mannanarie Homestead.  Tommy’s Gap at Cappeedee was named by the Blacks after Mr Miller’s father [Thomas Miller] who spelled his bullocks there for three weeks.  Mrs Miller died three years ago.  [Sarah Jane Miller, nee Pearce died 1922 aged 75.]
