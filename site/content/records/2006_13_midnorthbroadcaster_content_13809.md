Lane Crockett, General Manager Australia of Pacific Hydro, writes re alleged health problems caused by wind farms.  He challenges the assertion in a recent letter that ‘Peer reviewed medical research by suitably qualified persons is available …that clearly and unequivocally shows that persons living close to wind turbines may suffer a range of medical conditions.’

In fact:

Australia’s National Health & Medical research Council, Victorian Chief Medical Officer and SA’s EPA have all concluded that there is no scientific or medical evidence that wind farms have adverse health impacts.

Doctors for the Environment have supported this finding.

Public Health expert Professor Simon Chapman of Sydney University has recently published an article in the Medical Journal of Australia an article questioning who has fomenting community anxiety over this issue and questions the agendas of anti-wind farm groups.  Wind farms have been around for over two decades and yet claims that they directly threaten health are far more recent.  More than 100 million Europeans live within 10 km of a wind turbine and yet the issue is not on the radar of a single science academy in the world.

Pacific Hydro takes adverse health effects very seriously.  An independent report tested the levels of infrasound produced by wind turbines and the results showed they were well below perception levels and importantly well below levels produced by other natural and man-made sources.  One of the highest levels of infrasound was at a beach.

Various medical researchers and other academics have supported the claim that ‘there is no consistent evidence of any physiological of behavioural effect of acute exposure to infrasound in humans’ including Dr Gary Wittert, whose epidemiological survey found no correlation between increased prescription for related medical conditions claimed to be exacerbated by wind turbine operations.
