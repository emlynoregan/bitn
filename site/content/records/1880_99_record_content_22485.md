Editorial.  The editor takes issue with Cr Sampson at the last meeting of the Town Council when he complained about the unnecessary nature of much of the work done.  The editor thought the money well spent this year: roads and footpaths had been well and cheaply made and in doing so unemployment relief had been given to many a family.  It is true that much work is strictly unnecessary and that the Council is therefore collecting more than it needs and the rates could well be cut now.  A 20% cut is called for and indeed 30% if it were not that in the future all main roads in the boundaries will have to be maintained by the Council.
