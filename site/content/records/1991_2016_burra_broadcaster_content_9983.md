Booborowie Hall was the scene of a dance last Saturday to mark the 75th anniversary of the laying of its foundation stone.

Burra Picnic Race Clubâ€™s meeting at Thistlebeds on Sunday was a success, though sadly one horse had to be destroyed.

The Razorback property has been sold and Geoff & Rosemary Dare and family will consequently soon be leaving Mt Bryan.

Mavis Brooks, formerly of Barker Homes in Burra has moved to Adelaide.

Adam Simpson who is playing in the AFL for North Melbourne is the grandson of Len & Nancy Simpson of Burra.

Cheryl Day is the new face at the National Australia Bank.
