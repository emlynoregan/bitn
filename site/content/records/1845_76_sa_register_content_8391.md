Central Road Board

A letter was read from Mr Lawson of Gawler Town relative to the timber he placed under the bridges when the large engine was taken to the Burra Burra Mine.  He was willing to let the matter drop unless the Burra Company should claim the timber, in which case he would insist upon it as his right.  The secretary was instructed to write an answer that the Burra Company was making no claim upon the timber.

The Patent Copper Company wrote urging that some outlay be made on the Great Western Road from Kooringa to Port Wakefield, which had been declared a main line by the Legislative Council.

The Secretary was instructed to reply that at present the Boardâ€™s activities did not extend beyond the Gilbert, but the subject would be reconsidered when the means and staff of the Board were larger.
