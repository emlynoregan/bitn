NSW Gold

A private letter says a lump of gold weighing 46 ounces is going home to the Great Exhibition on the Thomas Arbuthnot, but the Captain has been unable to complete his crew, despite the offer of very tempting wages.  One merchant has shown in his office six pieces weighing collectively 9 lb.  It is announced there has been a big discovery at Maitland.

In SA there are rumoured discoveries at Mount Torrens and reports from Mount Remarkable, but these are unauthenticated.
