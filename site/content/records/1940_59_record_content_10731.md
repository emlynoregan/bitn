Council was under instructions not to construct and metalled or tarred roads and only to repair potholes.  Economy was being stressed during the war.

Regrettably streetlights had to be browned-out and occasionally were blacked-out.

The housing scheme was most successful and he had spent time and cash to bring it about.  As a result there were no empty houses in Burra and 40 families had been brought in, meaning at least Â£300 coming into Burra every fortnight.

Council had formed a War Damage Insurance Panel.

There were prospects for a good season and a reasonable price for farm produce.
