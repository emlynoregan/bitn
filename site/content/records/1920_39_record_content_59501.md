On Friday morning a big flood came through Thistlebeds.  The flows down the creeks which empty out onto the Eastern Plains will be of great value to the various owners.  Collinsville watercourse, Ulooloo Creek and Newikie Creek all ran strongly and the mail has been unable to get through to Ketchowla.

Torrential rain has fallen at Mt Bryan East area, but with no mail getting through there are few figures to hand.  Some of the falls from 4-11 January: Sturt Vale 453, Oakbank 408, Canegrass 401, Quondong 250, Old Koomooloo 162, Balah 212, Braemar 223 and Ketchowla 220.

Burra has registered 207 for the week, but falls have been very localised.  While the post office recorded 75 F. Harris in Kooringa reported 51 and at Aberdeen J.G. Wardle recorded 161.

Hanson and Farrell Flat had heavy falls, but Gum Creek got nothing.

On Wednesday the Burra creek flowed strongly from local flooding, but it has received nothing from further north.
