During the evening an interesting letter from Cpl J. Murison was read.  He is very near Belgium.  There was a postcard from Pte A. Wahlert and a note from Pte Page and a framed photo of Trooper B. Hill, who is so ill in Egypt.  So we now have photos of C. Lord, J. Bailey, J. Field, Winders, Wahlert and Hill.
