Obituary.  Alfred Stanley Barrett

Mr Barrett was born at Goodwood in 1887.  He was a member of the gifted Barrett family which conducted many evangelical meetings throughout the state.  When he joined his brothers he played the music at their meetings and the elder brothers gave the messages.  He became a Home Missionary and worked on Home Mission Stations where his practical help in building Churches was appreciated.  He was received into the Ministry in 1919 and ordained in 1923.  He worked in churches in the following circuits: Penong, Lameroo, Tailem Bend, Kulpara, Tumby Bay, Broken Hill, Minlaton, Nairne, Burra, Quorn and Woodside.  He married Miss Alice Whitbread on 20 August 1914.  His wife greatly assisted in the ministry.  Ill health forced his retirement, but he continued to do the work of his ministry through writing.  The funeral service was held in Redruth Methodist Church on Saturday and was conducted by the President of the Sa Conference Rev. B.H. Phillips, assisted by Chairman of the District Rev. C.F. Wells and the local minister Rev. M.A. Lind.

[Born 29 January 1887 Goodwood: died 17 September 1964 Burra.  He had been the minister for the Burra-Redruth Circuit 1943-47.]
