Burra Athletic Club. The fourth club meeting in Duff s paddock at Copperhouse last Monday started with a wet and boisterous morning, but by 11.00 a.m. the weather was improving and despite a strong wind events got under way at noon and in the afternoon there was a good number of spectators of both sexes. Results are printed. Prizes were distributed at the Institute in the evening.
