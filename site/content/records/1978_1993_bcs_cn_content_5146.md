Burra School and Community News

Exceptionally generous donations from local groups and individuals have eased the financial burden on the Apex Club and BCS in producing the Community News.  A management group will meet soon to plan for 1982 and to release a financial statement to indicate the level of support needed for 1982.  The future of the Community news depends on money to cover costs, but also on the goodwill and labour of many ladies in the community for typing, proof reading, art work, etc.  All are volunteers.
