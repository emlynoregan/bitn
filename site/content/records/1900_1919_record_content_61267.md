Peace Day, Hallett, Saturday 19 July.

Over £150 was collected for the Memorial Hall.  There was a procession from the Institute.  There was local indignation that Mt Bryan had insisted ‘our boys’ go there to play an association football match, but they had the satisfaction of beating Mt Bryan 2 to 1.  The procession left at 1.30 for the Recreation Ground where the National Anthem was followed by some stirring speeches from J.T.E. Richards, Chairman of the DC and others.  The children were given their Peace Medals and sports were played.  A social and concert was held in the evening and the hall was packed.  Supper concluded the evening.
