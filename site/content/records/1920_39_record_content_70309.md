Burra Swimming Pool Project

Another couple of columns are devoted to promoting the effort to get a pool.  The writer claims there would be no trouble collecting the money to add to the Council’s £400 and says that in the last week ‘authentic donations of £10 and £5 we heard of must have totalled well over the 70 mark.’  He cannot doubt that a working committee would easily raise the sum required.  ‘Not one parent or citizen has refused to give it his or her support.’

E. Steer	Has been teaching swimming for 45 years.  86 children had been taught at the Mine Pool in The Advertiser Learn to Swim campaigns.  He supported a citizen’s committee to promote a pool.

Walter Tiver	He was for a pool and against a grandstand.  Levelling the ground at Victoria Park would take a lot of work and money, as the side near the main entrance would have to be raised 6-8ft.

Dr W.E. Steven	He was for the pool and would donate £5.

Harry Mumme	Much in favour of the pool.

W.A. Harfield	A pool was a necessity.  He had lived in Jamestown where virtually all the children could swim and the pool paid its way.

S.C. Genders	Was for the pool.

F.T. Sara	Much in favour.

Rev. J.P.H. Tilbrook	Swimming is beneficial to every muscle of the body and is a great sport.

T.H. Woollacott	Mayor for 7 years.  Introduced the proposal and was disgusted that any other use of the money had been proposed.
