Kooringa Amusements

Mr Barlow assisted by Mr Baker made their debut at Ware’s Assembly Room on Monday evening, before a full house.  On the whole the entertainment was one of the most amusing, attractive and successful witnessed in this part of SA.  Most of the songs were rapturously encored.

[Note that this reference to Ware’s rooms is interesting in that Hoad’s list of hotels and publicans places Ware at the Burra Hotel from February 1858.]
