Burra Pre-School Kindergarten got away to a good start at the Parish Hall, but the number enrolled is far too small to enable it to continue successfully.  The committee feels that with suitable transport arrangements numbers will grow.  Arrangements have therefore been made with L. Fiebig to transport children to and from for 3d each way per child, collecting children at Sara’s Corner at 9 a.m. and at the Kooringa Methodist Church at 9.10 a.m. from 5 February.  Help keep the Kindergarten open by swelling numbers.
