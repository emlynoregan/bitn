Burra Waterworks.  The engineer reports the machinery is now working well and continually since his last report, except for the one and a half days taken in effecting repairs.  It is now working smoothly at Â¾ speed as any faster would fork the well in about an hour.  The town can be adequately supplied by pumping 16 hours a day.
