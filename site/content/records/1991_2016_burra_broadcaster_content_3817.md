Main Street Working Committee

A new committee of ten people has been elected.  The survey identified apathy and lack of courtesy as some of the problems of the district.  The committee will be named the ‘Burra Community Development Program’.

Other issues frequently mentioned in the responses were the lack of opportunity for youth and negative attitudes of traders.

Glenis Carpenter, owner of G.J. Creations, opened her lingerie shop on 18 April.  She manufactures a variety of lingerie as well as stocking nightwear, clothing, material and sewing needs.  [Photo.]
