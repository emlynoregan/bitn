Ratepayer of Burra Ward writes:

I hope the Council will bear in mind when they start receiving significant royalties from the Burra Mine that in the past Burra has paid higher rates than most of Adelaide suburbs.  Despite some reductions last year, further cuts could be considered.  The improvements to the Town Hall are to cost ratepayers $125,420 (thirty payments of $4,180).  This is mainly for office requirements, so why not wait a few years and then build a complex to meet all purposes.  In the meantime rent or buy a house or hall.  Make the scheme wait till there is cash on hand and save more than $50,000 in interest.  A more immediate need is an Effluent Disposal Scheme, Reconstruction of the Main Highway and water tables through Burra, redevelopment of the shopping area and cement footpaths and curbs.

If the Council could advise ratepayers of its long term plans it would get support.  Silence breeds rumours.

B.H. Rogers of Paxton Tce writes questioning the wisdom of proceeding with the Town Hall alterations and Council Chamber at a cosy of $75,000 plus interest.  He considers the signs for the future of the economy are not promising.  If the Mine should boom again the proposed changes might prove to be inadequate.  All in all the ratepayers need to consider the proposal very carefully.
