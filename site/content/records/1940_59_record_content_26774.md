Summing up the case against a betting shop Mr Brebner said the evidence against had been given by people of repute in the town.  Seven of the nine JPs were opposed to betting shops.  Only one minister of religion had given evidence; the rest were ordinary citizens.  Illegal betting might be apparent, but was not flagrant.  Evidence showed that illegal betting was now about half what betting had been in the legal days.  A betting shop would probably double the amount of betting.  It had not been shown that a town was deteriorating from the lack of a betting shop.  The public lost about £20 out of every £100 invested in betting shops.
