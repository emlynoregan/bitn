Burra Burra lodge MUIOOF Centenary.

This was celebrated on Saturday night with children’s sports at Burra North playground in the afternoon opened by Grand Master Bro. G.A. Brook.  W. Carpenter arranged the event very successfully.  The evening lodge meeting and social was at the Lodge Hall with a host of lodge representatives from the Kapunda district.  Mrs Sid. Scroop and daughters, Mrs G. Heinrich & Miss Aileen Scroop catered.  All was organised by the secretary of the Burra Lodge Bro. P.W. Hogan.  Toasts began with the Loyal Toast and then ‘Manchester Unity’ was proposed by M.T. Fuller to which Grand Master Brook responded.  The ‘Kapunda District’ was proposed by Bro. W. Carpenter to which Provincial Grand Master Townsend responded.   The Mayor F.T. Marston proposed the ‘Loyal Burra Burra Lodge and in doing so recounted the history of the Lodge.  It was founded in March 1849 with eight members (as noted from the last issue).  The oldest member till his death a year or so ago in his 90s had long been Mr James Jowett (who had died in Nedlands WA).

[James Jowett was born 1854, probably 3 May, and was a wheelwright in Burra.  He married Mary Statton.  He joined MUIOOF 21 March 1877.]

There were now about 400 members with over 100 juveniles.  The peak of the Lodge had probably been in 1933 when the hall was built, but it continues to flourish.

Grand Corresponding Secretary Bro. Brown supported the Mayor.  He said meeting were originally held in the [original] Burra Hotel.  PPGM Bro. Hogan responded.

The Grand Master then cut a huge centenary cake, the gift of PG Sister F.A.M. Scroop.

‘Lodge Doctors & Chemists’ were proposed by PGM Bro. Charles.  Dr Steven had been their doctor for many years and he was sure Dr Heddle would serve them similarly.  Chemists had been Rex Martin & Mr Coverdale.  Rex. Martin responded.

‘Our Ladies & Artists’ was proposed by PGM Badcock and Sister F.A.M. Scroop responded.  ‘The Mayor & Mayoress’ was proposed by GCS Bro. Ken White to which the Mayor responded.

Bro. W. Carpenter responded to a toast to himself.

Items between toasts were provided by Mrs L.H. Thomas, Mr Arnold Trueman, Mr L.H. Thomas (with encore), Miss Eunice Tiver, Bro. J. Carpenter & Mrs H. White was the accompanist.
