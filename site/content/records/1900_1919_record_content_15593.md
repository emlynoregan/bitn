Rev. S.E. Hansen (Lutheran) celebrated his 25th year as a minister on Thursday when about 90 people gathered at the Bright Church.  Rev. Nickel of Eudunda preached the ‘Jubilee’ sermon and Rev. Kempe of Balaklava presented Rev. Hansen with an illuminated address.  F. Duldig spoke for the congregation and presented an illuminated address and a purse of sovereigns.  Rev. Hansen has had a hard time of it since his congregations are widely scattered, ranging from Bright to Brinkworth to Allendale and east to the Murray, taking in Lindley, Shomburg [sic: for Schomburgk] , Bower and Eba.
