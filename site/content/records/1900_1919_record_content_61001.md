Eventually the committee’s report was adopted.

Mrs Hatherly had some concern about the voting and abstentions, but the Chair had nothing but contempt for abstentions.

There was a proposal before the committee that anyone who donated £100 be entitled to put a tablet in the hall to the memory of a fallen soldier.  Whether the donor’s name should also appear seems not to have been settled.

Mr Jefferies moved the method of raising the money be left to the committee.  Carried.

Mr Warnes then entered into an explanation of what had taken place in the lead-up to this meeting and made a response to the various writers to the Record, particularly the letters of Mr Pearse and Mr Hawkes.

There was a meeting at Market Square at which the Mayor invited the Chairmen of the District Councils to decide what scheme for a memorial would suit Burra and District.  When the meeting was held delegates decided they would go back to their districts and hold public meetings.  At the first public meeting I called only some 8 or 9 attended on a very wet night.  The meeting was adjourned.  At the next meeting a larger crowd attended and I put my case before the meeting: ‘I did not come here to drive something down their throats; I did not come here to say “You are not to support the Burra,” and I think you will bear me out.’

He then said the voting figures in the Record – 30 for and 1 against & 21 abstaining – were very misleading.

‘Those who did not vote were people who had lost their sons, and did not take part in the meeting.’

The Record reports my warning ‘Before you put this motion, which is a bit hard, think a bit.  You can’t go to the Burra without giving, and if you tie yourselves hard and fast to Mount Bryan you are wholly and solely on your own.’

But we are not hard and fast against Burra: Mr Jefferies said ‘We’ll put Mt Bryan first and then if Burra put up a scheme and we like it we can help them afterwards.’

Mr Pearse accused me of having influenced the vote, ‘but no man will move one of the best districts of people who know how to think for themselves.’

[After some nicely flattering comments about the local area and its people Mr Warnes goes on to say only 8-10 did not vote, rather than the 21 in the Record.]

He then turns to Mr Pearse’s suggestion he retire from public positions in Burra now he ‘has renounced the Burra’.

Mr Collins interjected: ‘It is the positions he would like.’

Mr Warnes agreed that was what Mr Hawkes and Mr Pearse wanted – ‘a clear run’.

[He then goes on about the Hospital Board and some of its woes, before running through other positions they may challenge him for if they wish.]

He is President of the Burra Show soc.

President of the Stock Owners’ Assoc.

He says he is on 14 or 15 committees [amended later in a letter to the Record to 28 -30.] and of them six or seven are in town. He was only paid for one position: managing Mr Tawke’s sheep shearing company.

He then takes offence at Mr Pearse’s comments that Mr Warnes finds the Burra Dead unworthy of consideration and therefore the living must be beneath contempt.  He stands by his patriotic efforts during the war.  He has never waited to be asked to subscribe to the various funds or the War Loan.  Mr Warnes then rehearses his credentials as a Burra boy and goes on to consider the supposed selfishness of Mt Bryan wanting its own memorial and says he thinks centralisation is one of the evils of the day.

If we are to be public spirited enough to support Burra then surely Burra should be public spirited enough to support Mt Bryan.  I say I have £100 for Mt Bryan, £100 for Burra and £100 for Booborowie and now I expect Mr Pearse and Mr Hawkes to match that.

Burra has done great things in the war effort, helped by people from the districts, but so have other places.  If you go to Clare you find the same societies doing the same work, but they don’t get on the chimney tops and advertise it.  Burra today has used Violet Day to gather subscriptions from the districts for gold medals for the boys who went from Burra.  The districts have already done that without going to Burra for help.

‘Mr Pearse says we are selfish, but I say the Burra is selfish, and has been right through the chapter.’

During the whole time Mr Crewes has been Mayor, the whole of the war, the District Council has never had an invitation to attend any public function in the Burra.  It is the same at Booborowie.  Before Mr Crewes came in there was always an invitation.  ‘They have taught us to run alone and now they don’t like it.’

They have not called a meeting at Hanson or Apoinga because Mr Hawkes is Chairman and he does not want them to go on their own.

[Mr Warnes then goes on to defend his position on the Mt Bryan District Council and he also itemises how he has helped young men returning from the war to get established by selling them land at low cost.]

As for the Burra including the district in acknowledgements, he mentions the Ambulances, which, when handed over, were given the appearance of having all come from Burra, when the people of Burra gave one and two gentlemen gave one and the money was collected from the district.

He reads out a report of Peace Day at Leighton, from when the decision was made to have a separate Peace Day was made.  He still believes what he said then.

Mr Rigby then spoke in support of Mr Warnes.

He considered Mr Pearse had taken the opportunity to settle old scores.

He said, ‘long before I came here I had heard of Mr Warnes, and his character, and it is useless for me to try to extol him in your minds.  I appreciate much a liberal-minded man who tries to live up to the reputation of manhood and makes his word his bond, but I do not wish to enlarge upon that.’

He was opposed to giving any help to Burra until the Mt Bryan project was completed.

He agreed that centralisation was the curse of the times.

Mr Warnes ended by saying: ‘The first thing is that the Burra Record should give us a big donation, because the people will want hundreds of papers.’
