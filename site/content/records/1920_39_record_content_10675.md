Hanson-Booborowie Railway

A meeting at the Booborowie Hall on 23 April discussed the Minister of Railwayâ€™s reply on the cost of the railway.  The meeting was unanimously of the opinion the railway should be built at the increased cost, given that the cost of money was now less.  Members for the district will be asked to arrange a visit by the Chief Railway Commissioner & the Chairman of the Railways Standing Committee and for them to address a public meeting.  The lack of a railway is seeing the land reverting to larger holdings and was a factor in the closure of the Booborowie Butter Factory.
