‘Pub Girl’ writes decrying the way hotel servant girls are sneered at by stuck up misses at balls etc. and condemned for dancing with shearers etc., but all the time the stuck up misses’ boy friends sneak in the back door to dance with them.  The girls should be commended for supporting their families instead of being subjected to jealousy because of their dancing habits.
