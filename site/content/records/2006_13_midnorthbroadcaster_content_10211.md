AGL’s Hallett 2 Wind Farm was opened on Saturday by the Premier Mike Rann with about 160 people attending on a very cold and windy occasion.  Hallett 2 has been generating since last year.  Mr Rann said more than $2 billion had now been invested in wind farms, which by the end of the year will contribute 1000 MW to the power grid.  This places SA ahead of its target to have 20% of its electricity powered from renewable sources by 2014 and on target for 33% by 2020.  He said wind farms were good for the environment and generated jobs and economic activity in regional communities.  AGL managing director said community support was a key factor for successful wind farm development.  He estimated that more than $2 million had been injected into the local economy and some 200 local people had worked on the project’s construction.  All service technicians at Hallett 1 & 2 are locals he said.  Lasting benefits to the community would also come from the community funds established for each wind farm project.

Wind Farm Protestors also attended the opening of Hallett 2.  Four opponents of further wind farms in the Mid North were on hand to make their opposition known: Dennis Dale & Liz Traeger of Yacka, with Bob Lamb & Ally Fricker of Brady Creek.  They held large placards decrying the loss of visual amenity and claiming that wind farms ruin lives.
