The Burra Regional Art Galleryâ€™s Annual Art of the Flower Exhibition for 2002 attracted more than double the number of entries for 2001.  68 pieces of art have been hung and they were complemented by displays of floral art over the weekend of 15-17 November.  A good crowd attended the opening on 15 November. The $500 prize went to Jacqueline Coates of Kapunda for her 1.2 m square oil on canvas entitled Sunflowers from my garden.  The judge was Linda Waldrum who has a Degree in Fine Arts and has moved to Burra from Queensland in recent months.  The curator was Carol Hancock.
