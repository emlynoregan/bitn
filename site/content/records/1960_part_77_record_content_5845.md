Fire.  A tractor is believed to have started a fire that burnt 1,000 acres of grass on Koonoona on Tuesday at about 1.30 p.m.  Units attended from Robertstown, Manoora, Eudunda, Burra & Saddleworth, but in the rough terrain it could not be completely extinguished, though it was controlled by 7 p.m.  No stock losses were reported and only slight fencing damage.
