He discussed various other tariff matters.

He mentioned the heavy cost of the Happy Valley Water Scheme and the contract with Messrs Martin & Co. for 92 locomotives.

He turned then to some issues with the pastoral country and thought in future more consideration would be given to the export of compressed fodder, wine, live meat and canned fruit.

He was disappointed with the yield this year of an av. of 4 bushels per acre for wheat.  Aid for farmers would be available.

He spoke of guaranteeing money lodged with the Savings Bank.
