Burra District Council Ratepayers’ Meeting, Friday last in Burra Institute.

Attended by the Councillors and about six ratepayers.  Given the problems of brumbies and unclaimed cattle, the Councillors were in favour of abolishing commonage within the District Council, but did not like to act without the ratepayers being consulted.

I.J. Warnes was in favour of the abolition.  Mt Bryan (where he was a Councillor) had cut it right out and so had Booborowie, as it cost them hundreds a year.  At King’s Well, Burra and Mt Bryan District Councils joined and Mt Bryan had the pleasure of dealing with strays from Burra’s commonage.  Mr Warnes gave examples of the problems associated with the strays.

He moved the adoption of the motion to end commonage.  Mr Brown seconded.

Mr A.B. Riggs said he assumed that a consequence would be the narrowing of World’s End Road to three chains with the balance allotted to farmers – a good thing.

The problems mentioned were dead horses that needed to be burnt, rogue bulls breaking down fences and entering paddocks and crops, feed being eaten out by unknown stock, rabbits and mongrel cows breeding.

Mr J.R. Rooke & Mr W.H. McWaters both spoke in favour of commonage.  Me Rooke said those who used it properly were being disadvantaged because others abused the system.  Mr McWaters spoke of a disabled man who could get little work, but lived on the edge of the common and survived by its use.  Mr Kellock said it was probably unfair to some, but there seemed to be no other way out of the difficulties.

The motion was carried with two opposed.
