Burra Hospital Board.

The tender of John Pearce was accepted for renovations to the nurses’ room and erecting a fence.

The old portion of the hospital building is to be removed.

The nurses’ bathroom is to be put in order.

Matron (Sister Solly) has resigned.

Mr Stevens, whose car accidentally damaged the hospital fence some time ago has complained strongly about the amount of the account sent to him.  It seems some other work was included in the account. A new account will be obtained.

The Matron’s position will be offered to Nurse Mildred and if she declines it will be advertised.
