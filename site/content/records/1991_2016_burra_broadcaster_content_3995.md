Burra Burra DC

Council decided to seek the aid of the Burra Pistol Club in controlling galahs.

$10,000 is to be earmarked in 1994-95 budget to amend the Burra Supplementary Development Plan to introduce an industrial area.  Council will investigate the purchase of 40 ha of suitable land not subject to flooding or near a waterway.

It was decided to fill in and landscape the old swimming pool, with the area to revert to parkland and the Building Inspector recommended that the ablution block be demolished.

Negotiations concerning the need for a change room continued with the Nursing Mothers’ Association.

It was decided to have the four S.T. Gill paintings, presently in poor condition, restored as soon as possible.  The quotation for this was $3,500 and in good order the paintings could be worth up to $80,000 each.

The Hon. Diane Laidlaw visited on 31 May to discuss the region’s submission on the Morgan Road.

It was decided to remove several trees, including two from in front of the Burra Post Office.

Council will not object to trading to 1 a.m. at the Bon Accord Hotel on Fridays and Saturdays.
