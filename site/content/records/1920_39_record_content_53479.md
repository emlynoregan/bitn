Obituary.  Charles E. Baker, father of Mrs George Melrose of Willogoleche Station died 26 October.  Mr & Mrs Baker came from England to live with Mrs Melrose eight years ago and they soon settled into the new climate and conditions.  Both took a great interest in local social and other activities and particularly those associated with the Anglican Church.  The deceased was a very energetic gentleman until his health began to fail in the last few months.  He was born at Montague Place, London in 1855, the son of the late Sir Charles John Baker and was educated at Haileybury College and then articled to Sir Hugh Hassard and Richard Webster, later High Chief Justice and Lord Chief Justice of London.  He was admitted to the Law Society in 1875 and was a Parliamentary Solicitor in Westminster for 50 years.  He was Secretary to the Non-County Boroughâ€™s Assoc. for 37 years and of the Urban Clerks Assoc.  He was a member for Kent on the London Metropolitan Water Board and for 35 years a member of the Beckenham Urban District Council and Chairman of it 12 times.  In the Great War he was a Machine Gun instructor for the National Guard and later a Captain in the Royal Fusiliers Cadet Battalion.  In 1879 he married Janet Duncan the daughter of William Duncan of Edinburgh and a granddaughter of Adam Black, a famous publisher and MP for Edinburgh.  Prior to coming to Australia in 1926 the couple had visited the country and had celebrated their golden wedding at Willogoleche.  There are two surviving sons in England and one daughter, Mrs Melrose.  There are three grandchildren.

[Registered as Charles Edmund Baker died 25 October at Hallett aged 78.]
