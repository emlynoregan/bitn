Don J. Kerin writes from the front in Libya, dated 25 April.  He is thankful for a Xmas parcel that he received only on Easter Monday, due to the rapid movement of the campaign, but he was none the less glad to get it.  He mentions going for a swim with Irvine Ogilvie and having a recent chat with Bill Johnson.
