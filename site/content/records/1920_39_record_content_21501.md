This has been a year of advance.  £41-14-6 has been received in building fees representing new building of about £12,000.  The Burra Institute is being improved with the addition of a supper room, dressing rooms and a larger stage room.  British Imperial Oil has bought Butterworth’s Mill and converted it to a bulk depot.  The SAR has provided an exit from the passenger station into Railway Terrace to do away with a crush at train time.

Steps are being taken to enclose the Soldiers’ Memorial and Rotunda with a suitable fence.  Mr Golding, architect, is advising and preparing plans.

The Roll of Honour will soon be completed and placed in the public reading room of the Institute.  This was possible when the Committee of ‘Back to Burra’ donated the nett profits of about £130 to the fund.

The Children’s Playground is also nearing completion.

We opened the year in credit £600-1-6 and will close in credit of about £200.  The upward trend in prices makes it unlikely we can reduce the rates from the present 2/9.

This year 300 pines were planted, but success with trees is difficult.  Many die and not a few are deliberately destroyed.  It is intended eventually to plant the creek as far up as Opie’s Hotel.

Victoria Park has been improved with the oval harrowed and replanted with couch.

The Children’s Playground is being established this year on land opposite the Roman Catholic Church and it will soon be completed.

The cemetery has recently been tidied.

The Local Board of Health has not had to deal with any serious outbreak of disease this year.  In the near future we expect the hospital to have a new Infectious Ward.

The lighting account payment of £434-13-3 looks very high, but it includes £138-8-9 due for payment in November 1925.  The actual 1926 cost was £296-4-6.  If possible lighting will be extended in 1927.

The Fire Brigade has not been called to any serious fires this year.

We have advanced £390 from the general account to maintain main roads and have asked for a special grant of £600 to complete the tarring to the Railway Station gate.

Rates collected were £2,326-6-7.

[The Ward accounts show the growing imbalance in ward incomes.  Allotted from rates were:

North Ward	£276

East Ward	£381

West Ward	£298]

Ratepayers’ Meeting

The Mayor regretted the retirement of Cr Kellock and with all deference to Mr Bednall he thought the people in West Ward should have had enough interest in the Council to put forward someone who had lived here at least a number of years.

F. Treloar regretted the Council’s apathy on Armistice Day and spoke in support of the work of the Mayoress.

Rev. Hewitson moved a vote of thanks for the ‘Back to Burra’ committee for the donation to the Roll of Honour.

Sitting Councillors then retired and appeared only reluctantly when the chair ruled (after some debate) that they should remain to answer any questions.

The Mayor said that they had only found out at the last minute they did not have a flag fit to fly on Armistice Day and the breach would not be repeated.

He believed no town in SA had better kept roads.  The town planned to tar the roads to the station and the hospital to the Council boundary and the eastern road as far as Abberton Park (not because he lived there, but because of the traffic).

Cr A.B. Riggs spoke in support of moving the boundary of North Ward to the south.
