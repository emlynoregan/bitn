Burra Institute, Annual Meeting

The Institute started the year in credit £251-9-5 and by December this was £186-2-7.  The money had been well spent on a splendid reading room for members.  Professor Henderson’s lectures had been fairly well attended, but they had hoped for better considering the expense.

Books now totalled 4,027

14 free scholarships for school children have again been given this year.

Membership	Dec. 1912	Double 25		Single 89	(114)

Dec. 1913	Double 24		Single 106	(130)

Messrs Fuss and Tiver were the successful tenderers for the new room at a cost of

£123-3-9.

A contract to replace forms with seats in the hall has been let and they should be installed within the next few weeks.  Provision has been made for operators of picture shows over the main entrance to the hall and has been satisfactory.

Mr Dane has begun an orchestral and choral class and we hope for a musical treat in the near future.

Elected for 1914:	President	C. Fuss

Vice-President	Rev. J.H. Nield

Treasurer	T.W. Wilkinson

Secretary	J. Drew

Mr Fuss said the committee would consider the suggestion to build a billiard room.
