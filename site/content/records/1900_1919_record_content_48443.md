‘A Burra Volunteer’ writes from Belgium dated 3 September, 10 September and 15 September 1916.  He is not named, but the details of life at and near the front extend for about 1⅔ columns.

Burra Boy Scouts have received a letter from Pte Horton Jennison about trench warfare.

Burra School held its speech day last Thursday.  The recently formed Fife & Drum Band of some 30 members played.  Mr Mundy reported 240 on the primary roll, comprising 122 boys and 118 girls.  Whooping cough and measles kept attendances low between July and October.   Mr Biddle, Headmaster of the High School said in January there were 38 pupils and 4 had since obtained positions while 4 had left the district and one girl was engaged in domestic duties to leave 29.  This was the greatest number in November since the High School was founded in 1913.  Attendance was not as regular as was desirable.
