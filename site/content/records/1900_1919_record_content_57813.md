PEACE

The message came through on Monday evening 11 November that Germany had signed the Armistice and hostilities had ceased.  Soon bells were ringing and hundreds of residents assembled in Market Square.  The Ladies and Menâ€™s Bands assembled and played the National Anthem and the Doxology was sung.  Tuesday was a holiday and the town was decorated gaily and a monster procession was formed of over 1,000 people at 10.30 a.m.
