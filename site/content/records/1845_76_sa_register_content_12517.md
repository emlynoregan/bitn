Kooringa News, 20 July

A young child has been lost at Baldina.  A child of a wood cutter named Campbell was sent to its father about 300 yards away where he was cutting wood.  It never arrived and has not been found despite intensive searches from Thursday to Sunday.  It cannot be doubted that it has perished in the bitterly cold and frosty nights.

[No corresponding death was registered.  John Stuart Campbell born to Charles Campbell and Mary Ann nee Wilson 6 December 1856 at Redruth is a possibility.  There is no registration of his death, but the same couple had another John Stuart Campbell born 6 September 1869 at Allens Creek, suggesting that the first child was dead by then.  This is also confirmed by a letter on the subject by the childâ€™s father; see 29 July 1859 page 3]
