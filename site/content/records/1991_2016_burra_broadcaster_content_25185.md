East Bungaree Stud is to be dispersed.  Due to a business restructure and growing demand for the finer woolled Hazeldean sheep on the East Bungaree Property it has been decided to disperse the East Bungaree stud flock in October.  East Bungaree’s origins predate Burra, when in 1841 the Bungaree Stud was formed.  In 1906 the Bungaree property was divided with each of founder George Hawker’s sons taking a part.  Edward purchased several other properties, including Belcunda, Caroona, Oakbank and lucerne country in the Booborowie Valley.  In 1937 East Bungaree Ltd was formed and the stud was known as East Bungaree-Belcunda.  When son Stanley Hawker died in 1979 the property was sold to W.H. Wylie, who made a number of changes.  The property reverted to the family in 1986 with its purchase by Andrew & Virginia Hawker.  In recent years the Litchfield family with the famous Hazeldean Stud near Cooma bought the property and now use it to promote the Hazeldean line of stud sheep and cattle.
