Kooringa News, 15 December

The weather has been hot and dusty.

Many miners have left for the Indigo diggings, travelling to North West Bend [Morgan] and then by river steamer.  Two carts full left on 12 December, another on 13 December and several had gone before.  Several were pursued to settle their accounts before they left the colony.

The driver of the Mount Remarkable Mail had a fit about three miles from Burra and had to be brought in.  It is supposed it was due to the heat on the long drive over the plains into Burra.

Mr Billing and his menageries leave here for Mintaro, Clare and other numerous places on the way to Adelaide.  He made a considerable stay here, but did not meet with the success that his collection and his exertions to please, merited.

A number of recent migrants have arrived to replace those lured to the Indigo diggings.  From the tenor of letters received here from the diggings not many more seem likely to be attracted there.
