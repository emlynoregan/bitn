Calici Virus

A report is printed on the recent spread of the Calici virus and its effect in greatly reducing the rabbit population.

There is a suspicion of human intervention in the release of the virus from Wardang Island, resulting in the outbreak at Yunta and in the Flinders Ranges.  The former outbreak has now spread to over 10,000 km2 and the latter to some 5,000 km2.  Pet rabbits need to be vaccinated.
