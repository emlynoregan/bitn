Booborowie Hall

At the last AGM of subscribers the President Mr A. Pearce announced that the last payment off the State Bank Mortgage had been made and the Hall’s financial position was sound.

Building additions and improvements are planned, but materials are hard to get and permits to proceed also need to be obtained.

The new floor was opened on 1 January and electric light has been installed.

The credit balance on 1 January was £310-0-9, with a fixed deposit of £50, War Savings certificates worth £200 and cash of £1-5-0 for a total of £561-5-9.

By 31 December 1946 this had fallen to £306-17-0 with the accounts for the electric light plant and installation yet to come in and also the account for the installation of the floor and ceiling.
