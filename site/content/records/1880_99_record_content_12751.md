Mr Rounsevell:

He briefly recited his views on taxation, believing the NZ model to be most unjust and iniquitous.  It permitted large landed proprietors to get off scot-free.  It would do away with improvements and cripple labour.  He though payment of MPs undesirable, but would support it if his constituents so indicated.

The candidates were then proposed to the meeting and the results were:

For	Against

Mr Rounsevell	51	26

Dr Cockburn	81	3

Mr Ridgway	16	0

Dr Stephens	45	1
