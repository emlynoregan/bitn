[The conclusion of his letter is bitterly ironic, as he had since been reported missing: later confirmed as killed in action.]

‘When we go into the firing line there are three things that can happen to us; if we are lucky we get a trip to another world; others not quite as lucky get wounded and go to Blighty; and there are the unlucky ones, those that get through safely and have to go in again, so it is a bit of a speculation with us as to which of the three is going to happen.’
