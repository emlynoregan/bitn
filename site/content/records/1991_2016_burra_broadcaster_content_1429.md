The Creation Bus is coming to town.  This is home to former school science teacher Peter Sparrow and their son Daniel.  It is part of an outreach program by Creation Science Foundation based in Brisbane.  It promotes the view that we did not evolve, but are ‘the products of creation as taught in the Bible’.

There will be an evening program on Thursday 1 July at BCS when Peter will also screen the creation film ‘The World that Perished’.  Other creation films will be screened on 2 July.
