Burra Races were held on Wednesday 6 April and were the most successful yet.  Facilities have been improved for owners, jockeys, horses and the public.  Since October there are new horse stalls.  On Wednesday 28 bookmakers turned over about £20,500.  Dust on the track and grounds were the main problem despite the use of 50,000 gallons of water to improve conditions.  The results are printed.  The main race was the Burra Handicap of £85 and a trophy valued at 30 gns and run over 1¼ miles.  The winner was Mr Smith’s mare Brilliant Queen, ridden by George Mules.
