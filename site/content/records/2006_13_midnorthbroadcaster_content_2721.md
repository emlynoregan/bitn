The 2007 Burra Antique Fair will be redesigned to encourage greater local participation.  It will be opened by ABC radio presenter, Peter Goers.  This year a second market/expo style venue will be set us in the BCS Gymnasium.  The aim of getting locals involved will include opportunities for groups to hold events and raise funds and such events will be able to be registered on the Antique Fair programs at no cost.  Entertainment for the fair will include Adelaide pianist Bruce Leach, Burra vocal talent Nathaniel O’Brien, Clare Concert Band and Bold as Brass.
