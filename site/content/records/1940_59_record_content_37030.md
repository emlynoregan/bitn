Sir Douglas Mawson, the noted geologist and explorer, visited Burra in the past week.  He is interested in mineral deposits in the district and was shown examples of talc and pottery clay by the Mayor.  The talc from Mr Norman Ford was judged by Sir Douglas to be of excellent quality and could become a valuable industry if it were proved in sufficient quantities.  The pottery clay was also of good quality.

[In the issue 71, 22, 8 June 1948, page 1 this information was corrected to say that the talc sample actually came from the Flinders Ranges, though the pottery clay was local.]
