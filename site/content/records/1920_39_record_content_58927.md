Mr & Mrs John G. Sara celebrated their Golden wedding on 9 December.  Both are children of pioneer residents of Aberdeen and were born at Aberdeen.  Mrs Sara is resident in the old family home from which she stepped forth as a bride fifty years ago.  Their only son was born there.  Mr Sara is the eldest surviving son of the late Mr & Mrs George Sara (Mr Sara Sen. was one of the old well-known firm of Sara & Dunstan, builders & contractors of Burra and Broken Hill.)  Mrs Sara is the eldest surviving daughter (Emma) of the late Mr & Mrs James Tiver, who previously owned the business now owned by Mrs Sara’s husband and son, Mr Frank T. Sara at Aberdeen.  They were married at Redruth on 9 December by Rev. G.E. Rowe.  Their family comprises one daughter Mrs Theo Carey of Broken Hill (Mr Carey is Chief Engineer at the Big Mine) and one son, Mr Frank T. Sara of Aberdeen, who married Miss Hazel Bartholomaeus, second daughter of Mr & Mrs Charles Bartholomaeus, now of Glenelg.  Mrs Carey has four daughters, the eldest of whom married Mr J.L. Watkins BE ICE (Lond.) Aeronautical Engineer. Another daughter, Jean, has just completed four years training on the nursing staff at the Broken Hill Hospital.  Mr & Mrs F. Sara have five children – four young daughters and a son.  All the close relatives residing in the Burra district that could attend were present on this occasion.  The reception and breakfast took place on the long verandah at the rear of their residence and there were just over thirty guests, plus children.  Mr Sara gave a brief resume of their married life.

Starting with very little they had made their first home at Terowie, where their daughter was born.  After a couple of years they moved to Cockburn and whilst there they saw the first engine cross the border into NSW.  Cockburn at the time was a great place for teamsters and at times hundreds would pass through the town with stores for Broken Hill.  There were no churches and the first service was held in their own business premises.  Among those who conducted services there were the late Dr H.T. Burgess LLD and Sir Frederick Holder.  After the railway reached Broken Hill they moved there.  During their stay there they had an interesting time and experienced many things including the big strike and a water famine.  Later they went to WA, but circumstances arose which drew them back to Burra.  Mr Sara took over the business and with the help of his son Frank had built up a thriving trade.  Now over 70, he was content to take life more easily and to leave the management to his son.
