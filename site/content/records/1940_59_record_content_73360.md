Burra Swimming Pool Committee has arranged for the Pt Pirie Scottish Pipe Band to be present at the return football match Past v. Present Players on 14 July.  It is intended that the band put on a street display also in Market Square at 1.45 p.m.  It is also hoped to arrange a Football Sprint Championship with two runners from each club in the Association to compete in full football gear.

Burra Hospital.  Matron Herbert has returned to Sydney and a previous member of staff, Sister Guymer, has accepted the position of Matron.

Mr W.H. Gare, who has been a director of Bence’s Ltd for about 26 years, is retiring due to ill health and was given a presentation of a travelling rug as a token of appreciation.

Weather.  With a recording of 428 points June was the wettest June for 40 years, since 559 points in 1916.  Creek have been running strongly and peaked on Thursday evening.  The small creek that crosses the Adelaide Road near the end of the bitumen ran a banker and stopped traffic.  The crossing at Gully’s Wharf was also running strongly and was still running well on Sunday.  On Saturday afternoon a driver got into difficulties on the way to Terowie at the Gully’s Wharf crossing and Mr Stan Irlam was asked to help move the car through the water.  Once it was across to the other side the driver went on without so much as a ‘thanks’.
