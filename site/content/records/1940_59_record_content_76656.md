Burra Branch of LCL.  At a meeting on 22 February the Hon. Norman Jude said every effort was being made to see the Burra-Adelaide Road was sealed as soon as possible. Bituminising costs had risen to Â£20,000 per mile and maintenance was as costly as for a metal road, though required less frequently.  The work already done was an excellent base on which to lay bitumen.
