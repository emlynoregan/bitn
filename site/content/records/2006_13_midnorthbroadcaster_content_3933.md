The Farrell Flat Management Committee will in future hold a Head Lease over all Council property in Farrell Flat, making it responsible for the Farrell Flat Memorial Hall, Duncan Park, the streetscapes and the Tennis and Golf Clubs.  The benefit will be greater town co-operation in dealing with the Council and in making various funding applications.
