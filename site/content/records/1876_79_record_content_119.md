SA Government Policy

[There is an article of just over one column reflecting on the policies of the Boucaut Government.  Boucaut had made much of stamp duties, but had been frustrated by the Upper House.  The Boucaut ministry fell on the 6 June and the writer considered the new Colton Government was an incongruous mixture of ministers.  Colton had announced extensions of railways and improvements to harbours and jetties.  Other matters were a water supply for Yorke Peninsula and improvements to the Real Property Act, land laws and mining laws.  Tariffs would be changes in the direction of free trade.  The most important new railways were to be to Government Gums 212 miles north of Pt Augusta, to open up new mineral areas and extend settlement.  The other line of importance was from Kapunda to Morgan to tap the river trade.  Other railways planned were to connect Pt Pirie, Gladstone and Jamestown and to connect the mining centres of Yorke Peninsula to the city via Barunga Gap and Hamley Bridge.  The extension of the Burra line to Hallett and eventually to the Barrier Ranges area in NSW was of greater concern to Burra.  The writer hoped the new Government would get on with its program and saw great hopes for the future in the growth of settlement and trade.]
