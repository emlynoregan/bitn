The Director of the SA Tourist Bureau, Mr Baker, visited Burra last Sunday with a photographer.  He judged the Burra creek Gorge to be a real beauty spot and a fine camping site, but too far from Adelaide for a day visit.  The party also visited Hallett and Dare’s Hill.  The latter earned a similar comment to The Gorge.  Burra could concentrate on providing day trips for visitors staying in Burra.  The old mine site is well worth half a day visit.  The verdict was that Burra has more to offer the visitor than most locals realise.
