Burra & District Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial.  Unveiling by the Prime Minister.

The Burra Memorial has not its equal in the country outside the large cities.  It is unique in design.  Some have argued that the sum of money between £2,000 and £3,000 should have been more usefully spent, but though there is some force in a utilitarian argument, there is much to be said in this matter for sentiment – that to honour the fallen we must have something that is solely theirs.  The cost in proportion to either the wealth of the district or to the sacrifices made by the boys is insignificant.  The crowd at the unveiling was estimated at 3,000 to 4,000 and there were over 100 cars in the square as well as traps.

The monument rises 40ft from the roadway like a miniature of the Nelson Monument.  There is a graduating base of about 14ft of granite, then an 18ft circular pedestal of polished granite surmounted by an 8ft bronze figure of an Australian soldier with fixed bayonet at ‘The Parry’.  The work is all Australian and was cast in Adelaide.  There are five bronze plates.  One bears simply the words: ‘Our Glorious Dead’.  Another ‘This memorial is erected by the people of this town and district in honour of their sons who died for King and Country in the Great War 1914-1919.  The plate on the opposite side lists the districts.  [This has since been replaced by the names of those who died in WWII.]  The remaining two plates carry the names of the 102 soldiers who fell in the war.

The figure was modelled by Mr Willmott of Messrs Pitt Ltd and was cast in five pieces by W. Dobbie & Co.  It weighs 10½cwt and is the largest piece of statuary attempted in SA.  Mr Tillett designed the memorial and carried out the construction and Mr Guy Makin was the honorary supervising architect.  The committee overseeing the effort had Mr E.W. Crewes as President and Mr G.E. Dane as Secretary.  The Salvation Army under Captain Heathwood provided luncheon.

The Unveiling

At 2.30 the Prime Minister, Mr Hughes, the Parliamentary Party, the Mayor, Town Council and Councillors of the District Councils took their seats.  Returned soldiers and nurses (80 & 3) assembled at the RSL Rooms under Surgeon Major Steele and Lieut. W. Carter and marched to the square where they formed up on three sides of a square around the monument.  Relatives of the fallen were accommodated in front of the monument.  The ministers of the town then conducted an impressive Church Parade assisted by Brigadier Hill of the Salvation Army.  A band comprising eight members of the now defunct Cheer-up Ladies Band and four returned soldiers supplied the music.

The Prime Minister then presented the soldiers with their War Service Medals.  The Mayor said the principal reason for asking the Prime Minister to unveil the monument was because he was known as the friend of the ‘digger’ both during the conflict and after the return from service.
