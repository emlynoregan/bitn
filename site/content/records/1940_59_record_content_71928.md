The Swimming Pool Committee held its first meeting last Thursday with H.J. Topsfield as President.  B. Gryst of the Savings Bank was elected Treasurer and R.G. Jeffery (High School Headmaster) became the Secretary.  Mr D. Bednall will draw up a constitution and rules.  The public will be asked to submit suggestions for a site, which should take into account proximity to the school, water supply, drainage and accessibility.  The committee will visit other pools to get ideas.  The need to include the Councils in the resolution is because their ultimate control of the project is necessary if a Government subsidy is to be paid, but this does not mean that either Council will be responsible for any of the finance involved.  All donations will be acknowledged in the Record and should be sent to the Treasurer c/o the Savings Bank.
