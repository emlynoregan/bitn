Letter.  Olive Oates also wrote suggesting that Mr Sturman could easily have clarified the positions of the churches with a few phone calls before making his unwarranted assertions.  ‘For Mr Sturman – a relative newcomer to Burra to make such unresearched, sweeping and ill-informed judgements is both offensive and unfair.’
