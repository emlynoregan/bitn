Burra Cheer-up Soc.

The Ladies’ band reluctantly farewelled Miss Frada Truscott on 18 June.

A photo of the late Lieut. R. Hawkes has been received and also of Sgt Ross Harris, Pte Jack Highett & Pte Tregonning.

The Ladies’ band visited Riverton on 20 June for a recruiting meeting.

On Monday 1 July there was a welcome social for L-Cpl Bernard Lowe, Pte C. Wahlert & Pte Rankine (a visitor).

As a result of Violet Day £100 has been sent to the Cheer-up Hut in Adelaide and £50 to the Salvation Army via Captain Trigg of Kooringa.

110 good novels etc. have been sent to the library at the Soldiers’ Hostel in Adelaide.

Pte Will Herbert was welcomed by the Ladies’ band etc. at the station on Monday despite the very cold wet weather.

The Ladies’ band has been invited to assist at Australia Day at Gladstone, Crystal Brook, Hallett & Laura, but has been unable to accept all – they will go to Hallett on 27 July.
