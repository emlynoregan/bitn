Lock-up stage was achieved about two weeks ago and final interior fittings are now being installed.  Fund raising by the various clubs appears to be in hand.  Local farmers have prepared soil for many hectares of crops.  25 volunteers raised $800 stone picking at Porter Lagoon.  The Committee won the tender for refuse collection in Burra, worth $4,000 p.a.  Other ways of contributing â€“ buy a brick for any amount over $2 or become a Foundation Member for $100.  Ordinary membership is $10.  The Buy a Brick total is now $515.
