Town Hall Chairs

When Wednesday night films came into operations it was decided to take the profits from them to buy folding chairs for the hall.  It has taken quite a while to accumulate the funds.  After various Councillors investigated possible chairs, which have to be comfortable, light and stackable, a type was selected.  It has been found that Matthew’s Emporium in Burra can supply them for £6-5-0 less 4%, delivered, while the best city price the Town Clerk could arrange was £6-12-6 less 2½% plus delivery charges.  As a result the Council voted to buy 104 ‘Royal’ chairs from Matthew’s Emporium.  They will complete the rows at the back of the hall.
