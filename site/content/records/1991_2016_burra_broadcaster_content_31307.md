Youth Conservation Corps Program begins.

Three young people have begun working in the program in the Mid North, with three spaces still available to interested parties.  One of the projects will be the Burra Restoration of Riparian and Grass Ecosystems Project.  It has locations in Mokota, Redbanks, Caroona Creek and Spring Gully Conservation Parks.  For two days a week over a twelve week period students will be involved in monitoring water quality, flora and fauna surveys, erosion control, pest control, revegetation, fencing, GPS mapping, site preparation and plant propagation.  On day three they will participate in accredited training.  After twelve weeks they will join a club where they will put together an employment portfolio and undertake job search training and work experience.
