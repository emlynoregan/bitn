Redruth Court, 17 February

Thomas Moyes, alias James Stewart was committed for trial at Gladstone for obtaining a horse and two £1 notes by false pretences.

Miss Hirsy, barmaid at Opie’s Hotel was charged with supplying a glass of beer to an Aboriginal native.  The lowest fine was imposed as the beer had been sold to a young man named McGrath, who had passed it on to the Aboriginal.  A similar case against E. Roach of the Exchange Hotel of supplying beer to Nanyeri was dismissed as the wrong barmaid had been summonsed. [But see appeal IV, 197, 7 April 1882]
