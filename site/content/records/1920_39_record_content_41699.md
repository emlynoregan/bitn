RSL Masquerade Ball was held 28 April in the Institute.  Excellent music, spectacular decorations and a bounteous supper helped to produce a great success.  Costumes were not numerous, but those who took the trouble were impressive.  ‘Captain De Galoot’ (Tom Canny)* mounted on a ‘horse – Phar-Lap’ (W.V. Bass & H.H. Byles) rode in and cut the ribbons!  Best dressed lady was Mrs A.L. Bence (1932 Follies).  Best dressed man was A. Molinari as the Duke from Rigoletto.  Most humorous and best sustained were Mr Jack Jones and Miss Stella Lawrence as a sundowner and his wife.  Music was by the Black Diamonds Band of Adelaide.

[* A very topical reference to the dramatic incident on 20 March 1932 when Capt. De Groot of the New Guard dashed up to cut the ribbon on Sydney Harbour Bridge ahead of Premier Jack Lang.]
