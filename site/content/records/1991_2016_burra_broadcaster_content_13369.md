BCS.  Eight students attended the Rostrum Voice of Youth Competition in Jamestown on 12 May.  [Title of event from Issue 313, 11 June 1997, page 3.]  Burra speakers did well without getting into winning places except for Rachael Vogel, who won a $40 cash prize and the chance to speak in Adelaide on 1 June.

[Though the report Issue 313, 11 June 1997, page 3 indicates the semi-final was in Port Augusta rather than Adelaide.]
