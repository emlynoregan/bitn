Burra Burra DC has acquired all the land previously controlled by the Burra Sports Syndicate and also, by the use of a subsidy has been able to acquire the ‘land over the road’ and so now the whole of the Burra Golf Course is Council land.

Robertstown Council has asked the Burra Burra DC for support in repairing roads etc. in the Burra Gorge Picnic Area at World’s End.  Council will inspect before deciding.

Accident.  An interstate semi-trailer loaded with 16½ tons of balled cotton [check: bailed?] overturned on the Mt Bryan Road at 3.45 a.m. on Thursday, while en route to Adelaide.  Driver Paul Kalas of Queensland suffered cuts and abrasions to his right arm and leg and a passenger Kenneth Joseph Freeman of NSW suffered minor injuries.  Damage to the trailer is estimated at $2,500.  Clode’s crane pulled the vehicle back onto its wheels.
