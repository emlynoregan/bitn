R.P. Brodie writes to take issue with Steven Reeves over the latterâ€™s recent letter about the RAG.  He says he was not aware that he needed to be incorporated before being entitled to express an opinion.  RAG incidentally does have minutes, but he had not expected to have to supply them over the phone to Mr Reeves when he rang.
