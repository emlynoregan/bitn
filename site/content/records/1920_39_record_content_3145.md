Obituary.  Mr E.C. Sedgman, the Chief Engineer of the Burra Waterworks, died suddenly from heart failure on Monday.  He was born at North Allendale near Kapunda on 17 November 1871.  He was the second surviving son of the late Thomas William Sedgman of Quorn and Mrs E.J. Sedgman now of Rose Park.  He worked for some time for the SAR and then at Bundaleer where he married Miss Frances Pawelski.  On the completion of the Bundaleer Reservoir he transferred to Burra in 1903.  He took a keen interest in sport and was a principal supporter of the Burra Boy Scout Troop.  He leaves a widow and young family of three sons and five daughters, the eldest of whom recently married Mr R. Schuyler of Aberdeen.  [Edward Charles Sedgman born 14 October 1871.]
