Elections.  Meeting at the Institute last Wednesday with the Mayor in the chair.

G.H. Lake.  Would not support a capitation grant in the life of the next Parliament, but had little else to say on policy.

W.R. Ridgway spent some time explaining why he was not reported in the Advertiser which was too busy supporting the Government, or in the Record which was too busy supporting its editor, Mr Holder, or in the Jamestown Review which was too busy supporting its editor, Mr Lake.  He thought the Government policy was good except for the progressive land tax, but made no other significant policy statements.

Mr Richardson has decided after going around the electorate that he is now in favour of a progressive land tax and for mining development and the Transcontinental Railway.

Mr T. Ward is for homestead blocks, but not at the expense of stock routes unless absolutely necessary.

W.H. Duncan believed if they went into progressive land tax it would lead to a single tax and land nationalisation. (laughter)  He was for a property tax and the Transcontinental Railway.  Like Mr Ward he thought the Government should be responsible for the control of noxious weeds and vermin on their land as much as the landowner is on his.  He favoured homestead block, but only on good land where something would grow.  He personally opposed payment of members, but would go along with public sentiment on it.  He was against local option, but if elected would support it with compensation.

F.W. Holder pointed out that he had not had editorial control of the Record for the last nine months and in fact both the Advertiser and the Register had published longer reports of his speech than had the Record.  He was glad the progressive land tax was being supported.

Mr Dunstan Jun. complained of a libel published in the Terowie paper comprising an advertisement inserted by a Burra elector and asserted his suitability for election, but had little to say on policy.

All candidates objected to Bible reading in state schools.

All except Duncan & Dunstan opposed a deposit by candidates to be lost if they obtained too few votes.

All supported free trade between states.

All supported local option with compensation except Richardson.

All favoured an 8 hour day in Government employment.

All were for free and compulsory education.

Only Mr Dunstan would make plumping illegal.

Ward and Richardson opposed single member electorates.
