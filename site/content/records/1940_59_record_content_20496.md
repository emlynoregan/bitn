An Accident.  Jim Reilly parked his car on ‘Cowdung’ Hill at Burra North on a windy day last week.  He left it in gear and chocked the wheel, but apparently the wind was strong enough to lift it over the blocking stone and begin it on its way downslope towards the showgrounds.  It ended up knocking down a portion of the Showground galvanised iron fence and came to rest quietly against a post.  When found it was quite undamaged and could simply be driven away.
