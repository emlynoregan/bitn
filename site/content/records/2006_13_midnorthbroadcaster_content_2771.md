Accident.  A semi-trailer loaded with 93 bales of wool rolled over on the notorious S bends just north of Mt Bryan on 27 February.  The accident occurred at 1 p.m. and the clean-up took until 7.45 p.m.  This bend at a long gone railway crossing was the site for a rear-end crash in 200, two roll-overs in 2005 and a single vehicle accident in 2006.  The cost of removing this unnecessary series of bends could be up to $1 million.
