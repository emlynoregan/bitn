The train speed was 18-20 m.p.h. and it stopped in 400 to 500 yards.

[The paper incidentally swaps between the train’s brakes and its breaks at random in discussing halting the train.]

The evidence of the driver, stoker and guard do not add significantly to what has been noted.

The number 10 up goods from Terowie had left Terowie with four red lights on to indicate a special was to follow.  The guard of this train said we passed the house of the deceased and he could have settled any doubt about the special by looking at our lights.

The verdict was:  ‘That the deceased William Davis, was accidentally killed by being overtaken by a special train between Mt Bryan and Burra Stations on Saturday June 28, 1890, while riding a tricycle in the execution of his duty.’
