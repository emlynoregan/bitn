The ambition had been to open the hall free of debt.  Money came in slowly until a gift of £1,000 from Mr James Reed.  Money then came in more quickly as the opening drew near and at the end Mr James Reed said he would make up any deficiency.  The cost was £4,400.  The building was constructed by Messrs T.H. Woollacott & F.M. Pearce supervised by the architect J.H. Laity.
