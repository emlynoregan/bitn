Accident/Obituary.  On 2 March William Thomas aged 4½ fell off the longitudinal beams of the ford near Aberdeen into the water and drowned.  At the inquest his sister Mrs Mary Elder said that her mother had gone to sew at Mr Goodridge’s.  Mrs Elder had sent the deceased and his little sister to the Mine Creek with dinner for her brothers, who were working there.  The deceased on his return said that in the afternoon he had to go to a place near the creek to get some grapes from a little girl named Davey.  She left the deceased playing outside his home some 200 yards from the creek and had told him not to leave, but when she returned half an hour later, he had gone.  Not finding him, she raised the alarm.  Lance Corporal Smith said they had searched till 1 a.m. and started again at dawn.  They dragged the creek at 7.30 and found the deceased in a six-foot-deep hole close to the ford near Dunstan’s.  The jury found that the deceased had drowned through accidentally falling into Burra Creek.   [The birth does not appear to have been registered in SA.]
