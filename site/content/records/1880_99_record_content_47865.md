United Friendly Societies’ Sports on 26 December have attracted 66 nominations for the cycle events including 22 from and near Adelaide.  This year the rules allow for mixed bicycle events.  Some think this is a mistake, but ‘Whip’ thinks ‘The graceful movements of the “little chaps” in spinning around the track will be the cause of much excitement and amusement’.

[Presumably this means both penny-farthing bikes and the then new safety bicycles were both allowed.]

Arrangements have been made to attach a carriage to the 5 a.m. goods train from Adelaide to convey contestants to the event.

Bicycle types include:	pneumatic racers

pneumatic roadsters

cushion

solid

ordinary racer
