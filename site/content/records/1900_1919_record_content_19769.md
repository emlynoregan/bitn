Burra Town Council.

The curator of the cemetery reports the wood at the morgue requires painting.  [A reference on 22 May suggests ‘the morgue’ was actually the mortuary chapel at the cemetery.]  He also requested a small allowance on account there were no burials in March or April.

It was resolved that four acetylene lamps be got and fixed to the lanterns now in use.

Mr McLaren is to remove the obstacle on the road at the rear of his premises.
