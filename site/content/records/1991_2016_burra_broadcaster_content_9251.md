BCS had a permanent Agricultural teacher for 1995 and as a result has been able to develop a long term plan for the Agricultural curriculum.  This will continue for 1996, with a vocationally based course in Year 11, said teacher John Agren.

Burra’s Years 6 to 10 students take Agriculture as a compulsory subject and it is an option in Years 11 & 12.

Two ‘farms have been used this year – one between the school and Smelts Paddock and the other at Kookaburra, behind the old Hampton Township.  Ten acres were cropped at Kookaburra and ten at the school – mostly by Year 11 students.

The land near the school has copper toxicity problems and animals kept there too long die from copper overload.  Onion weed and shallow soils also plague that site.  All classes had some exposure to the led steers project, though the main work there was done by Years 11 & 12 students.  The result had been considerable success at the Royal Adelaide Show.  Year 8 students had mainly reared the eight ‘bobby’ calves.
