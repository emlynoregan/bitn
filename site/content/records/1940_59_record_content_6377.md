The Local [Recruiting?] Committee was addressed on Sunday by Flying Officers Morphett and McLachlan of the RAAF Advanced Recruiting Committee.  The Mayor T.H. Woollacott was in the chair.  They stressed the importance placed on references supplied by local committees, school teachers and members of the Postal Institute.  Such references could mean that applicants were eventually promoted to commissioned rank in the RAAF.  It was important that committees held meetings monthly and were aware of current requirements for the RAAF.  One month they might need carpenters, but not the next month.  It was important that committees considered carefully what jobs the applicants would be suitable for.  Applicants through the local committees had the advantage of receiving their examination at an appointed time and of having their rail fares refunded.  Applicants could put in two applications; one for Ground Staff and one for Air Crew.  Films on the training of Air Force personnel followed the meeting.
