Catt Bros. Servwell will become Booborowie Welcome Mart after 12 years.

Oppyâ€™s Super Valu store in Burra will be renamed Foodtown.

The former names Servwell and 4-Square were owned by Independent Holdings, who have been taken over by the interstate company Davids and SA stores are now coming into line with names used by them in eastern states.
