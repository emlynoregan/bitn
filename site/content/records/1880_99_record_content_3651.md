He then moved to rescind the motion of 28 Feb. in which certain moneys were appropriated to the bridge in Kangaroo Street.  2nd Cr Lewis, who said he did not wish to be seen to have taken advantage of Cr Sampson’s absence on the 28th, though he claimed that he did have Cr Sampson’s approval for the original motion.  Sampson’s motion carried.

Cr Sampson then laid down a paper containing an appropriation for South Ward moneys.  The Mayor thought he was presumptuous to do so without having consulted either the other South Ward councillor or anyone else.

Cr Sampson demanded the withdrawal of the word ‘presumptuous’. 

The Mayor refused.

Cr Sampson then refused to read his appropriation unless the word was withdrawn.

Cr Lewis then produced a proposal for an appropriation for £160 for various urgent works in South Ward, with the remaining £50 to be set down for the Kangaroo St Bridge.

Cr Sampson then asked if that was not also a presumption.

After much loss of time it was apparent that the two South Ward councillors could not agree.

Cr Rabbich gave notice that at the next meeting he would move the whole council appropriate the south Ward money.

Cr Sampson’s proposal is then printed.  It contains no mention of funds for a Kangaroo St Bridge, but reveals that the bridge at the end of Welsh St, into Ayers St is known as Boundy’s Bridge.
