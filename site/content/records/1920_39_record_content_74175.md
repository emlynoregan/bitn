Burra Town Council, 20 February

Effect has been given to the proclamation concerning Ward Boundary alterations.

The Burra Hospital Board has declined to furnish a report of its doings to Council, but says it is within the powers of the Council’s representative on the Board to furnish such.

The Town Clerk reported the removal of battens from the bottom half of the shed at the Kooringa Children’s Playground.  The remaining battens will be removed and police asked to keep an eye on the place.

Tubercular Soldiers’ Aid Society makes its annual appeal.  Locally this was left in the hands of the Mayoress Mrs S. Kellaway.
