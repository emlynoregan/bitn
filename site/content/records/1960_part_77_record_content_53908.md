Litterbugs.  Gabriel Bammer writes on behalf of a group of University students who are usually the butt of criticism.  She expresses their disgust when they were at World’s End Creek recently when a group of local immature youths arrived with bottles in hand and proceeded to overturn everything moveable in sight and then to throw their empty bottles down to shatter among the dead trees and rocks.
