‘A Teamster’ writes from along the road to Burra Burra 7 October.

The ‘Press’ is solicited by the poor bullock-driver to help his starving team along the road, and through the ‘pinch’.  The Burra Directors have sought to diminish the pay of labourers and others at the mines to one guinea [21/-] per week.  This is unjust because the pay of labourers in Adelaide is 4/- per day [24/- per week] and at the hay and wheat harvest more.  Provisions are about 40% cheaper there than at the Mine.  We, the teamsters, sympathise with the demands of the labourers and insist on an increase in the price of cartage and can show you good and rational ground for such an increase.
