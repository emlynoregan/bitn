‘A Member of 11th Light Horse’ writes a letter dated 21 August recounting heroic stories of the Anzac Landing.

[This letter from an un-named soldier so long after the event and so very apt for the conscription debate and the referendum seems suspiciously like a plant.  It reads like a patriotic speech from E.W. Crewes or one of his ilk, rather than a genuine letter from the front, but perhaps it is what it purports to be.]
