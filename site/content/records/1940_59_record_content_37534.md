Burra Town Council held its final meeting for the current year last night.  Cr T.H. Woollacott expressed his congratulations and thanks for the fine work done by the retiring Mayor and Mayoress, Mr & Mrs H.J. B. Jennison.  He also asked that a minute of appreciation be recorded for the contribution of Cr S.J. Woollacott, who was also retiring.  The Mayor thanked Cr Woollacott and said no one knew the amount of work the job involved until he had experienced it.  He certainly now fully appreciated the effort of Cr T. H. Woollacott, who had been Mayor right through the war and had the courage and fortitude to continue despite losing two of his sons during that conflict.  He also thanked Council workers, his fellow Councillors and the Town Clerk and Mrs Jennison for her support.  Crs S.J. Woollacott and Baulderstone supported the previous speakers.  Councillors and employees were later entertained at the residence of the Mayor and Mayoress.
