Sir Charles McCann, Agent-General and Trade Commissioner for SA in the UK, visited Burra on Wednesday at the invitation of the Stud Masters’ Assoc. and the Stock-owners’ Assoc.  He delivered an interesting speech on problems confronting primary producers.  Sir Charles was introduced by the Mayor (F.T. Marston).  Sir Charles was accompanied by Sir George Jenkins, the Minister for Agriculture.  Sir Charles was also President of the International Wool Secretariat.  He said he regretted the high prices for wool which were driving consumers to substitute synthetic fibres, particularly in the USA.  Wool is fighting back with finer fibres down to 1 oz per square yard and with moth-proofings and shrink-proofing.  Successful marketing campaigns were being waged.

In the meat trade competition had been much affected by the Ministry of food in the UK buying in bulk during and following the war, but competition based on quality would return and quality producers would ultimately have the advantage.  SA frozen lamb now compared favourably with the NZ product.  Sir Charles regretted Australia’s lax approach to advertising its products compared with Canada, South Africa and NZ.  He favoured subsidising the importation of quality stock to improve blood lines.  SA had sent over 150,000 food parcels to the UK.  Many of the 2,900 Australian tourists who visited the UK last year had called at SA House near Marble Arch.

Sir Charles then answered questions.
