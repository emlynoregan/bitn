Royal Mining Co. held its half-yearly general meeting last Wednesday morning, 8 November at the Gresham Hotel in King William Street.  Mr H. Mildred MP took the chair.  Mr Tomkinson asked what had reduced the assets from £300 to £90 in the last six months and was told it was due to £37 to the secretary’s salary, £78 for Directors’ fees and the rest was advertising, stationery and travelling expenses.  He said operations at Karkulto had not gone well and the lease with the man in charge had terminated.  272 tons of iron ore at grass had not been sold.  The Directors still thought there were remunerative quantities of copper there, but they would leave any decision to the shareholders.  Mr Wilkinson moved that the Directors take the necessary steps to wind up the company.  He said the only persons getting a regular return from the company were the Directors and the £94 in hand would not keep the company going for another six months.  No progress seems to have been made since 1857.  [Further discussion is then reported.]  Eventually the motion was put and carried 15 to 8.
