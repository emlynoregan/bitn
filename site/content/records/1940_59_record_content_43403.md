The Annual Post Office Picnic was held at Gum Creek Station.  Last year the scope was extended to embrace all neighbouring officers and non-official post offices and this move was a great success.  This year even more people came and over 150 people attended.  Most offices from Terowie to Saddleworth were represented â€“ Clare alone contributed 47.  An afternoon of sporting events was enjoyed and the results are printed.  [The report runs to 1 column.]
