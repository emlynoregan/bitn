Letter.  Bob Skinner writes to express his appreciation of the array of correspondence in last week’s Broadcaster.  He deplores however, the tendency of too many to demean themselves by negative and personal criticism of people in Burra who have opposing views to their own.  The denigration and abuse of Dr Cross by most of the correspondents was most unfortunate and illustrates an appalling lack of positive debate.  It appears that it is the general opinion of most people that winning at any cost and criticising by downgrading your opponent is part of the scheme of life.  This is part of reality TV that appalled Bob.

He says that while well aware of the monetary benefits to Burra of the television program, the example set by this type of program, especially to young people is not one that encourages respect for other members of the community.
