Decimal Currency

With the Commonwealth Mint busy making the decimal coinage, they cannot manufacture more pennies and half-pennies.  These are in short supply, it is believed because people think they will be able to make a profit on them after decimal currency comes in.  This is not so; half-pennies, pennies and threepences will only be exchanged in multiples of sixpence, which have exact equivalents to multiples of five cents.
