William Killicoat is selling without reserve, at his residence near the old Smelting-works, Redruth, Household Furniture & Effects on 2 March.

An advertisement on page 3 advises the house is to let and says it is ‘At Burra Copper Works’: apply P.L. Killicoat, Abberton Park.

[Presumably one of the two attached houses just off Smelts Rd.]
