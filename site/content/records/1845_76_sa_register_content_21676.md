Burra News, 25 March

[On 12 March in NSW there was an attempt to assassinate HRH the Duke of Edinburgh by James O’Farrell.]

An address expressing sympathy to Her Majesty the Queen has been signed eagerly by all classes.

Obituary.  Mr Nicholas Opie of the Smelter’s Home Hotel, Aberdeen, died suddenly.

[Died 24 March 1868 near Aberdeen aged 46.  BISA says he was born 22 March 1822 probably at Wendron in Cornwall, UK.]

Accident.  Last Sunday Mr George Bennett was driving from Aberdeen to Kooringa with Mrs Bennett in the evening.  At the Mine Bridge a boy jumped up behind and distracted Mr Bennett, who accidentally pulled one rein the wrong way.  As a consequence the vehicle capsized from the higher to the lower road.  There were no serious injuries.

John Robertson, hawker, sent his four young children to school on Tuesday, but they failed to return.  They could not be found in the evening or that night.  At 11 a.m. today they were found on the Mine Hill.  They had slept in the creek all night.  They said they had not gone to school for fear of being punished by the teacher for some offence the previous day and were then afraid to come home for fear of being punished for not going to school.

William Henry Richards was fined £10 plus £1-16-0 costs for selling less than the minimum quantity of ale allowed by his store-keeper’s licence.

Two mule drivers were fined 5/- each plus £1 costs for riding on their mule wagons without having some person on foot to guide the mules.
