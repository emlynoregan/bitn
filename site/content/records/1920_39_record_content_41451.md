Weather.  Rain in the last week has totalled 135 points locally.  Not much fell to the east, though heavy rains in the Baldina Creek catchment sent a flood down on Friday that flowed 3ft deep over the ford, followed by a second flush an hour or so later.  Falls in the area seem to have been about 50 points.  World’s End did quite well.
