Numbering of Issues in 1931.

The year began with Volume 52, Number 1 on 7 January 1931.

And continued to Volume 52, Number 51 on 23 December 1931.

But there are a couple of anomalies:

Issue 30 is followed by issue 40, but then numbering returns to the expected sequence with 31, except that 32 is not used and 40 is used a second time when it occurs in its correct place in the sequence.
