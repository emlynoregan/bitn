The buildings in the old copper mine played an important part in the early days of SA and of mining in Australia.  They have been well publicised in recent years by the efforts of Mr Ian Auhl.  The Burra Corporation bought the mining area about ten years ago so that the relics could be restored to attract tourists.  Lack of finance has allowed little restoration, but extensive visits by tourists have occurred.

I like the suggestion by Mr Hope that the Morphett Shaft poppet head be restored.  I consider as many buildings as possible should be preserved and if this is not possible then the main round chimney stack should be placed as close as possible to Morphett’s poppet head.  I feel this should be a Commonwealth and State project, not just a local and SA project.  I agree with the District Clerk that local rates should not be used, but disagree that any royalties from the mine should have a low priority as far as restoration of historic items is concerned.  They should have a very high priority in this respect and he should realise the mine area was bought for historical and tourist purposes.  I trust the District Council will give the matter plenty of thought.  If any buildings are resited:

‘I hope they are placed in a position which will not spoil our pretty street, like the stone recently placed in Market Square.
