Burra Town Council, 21 May

Various minor works were approved.

There was a discussion relating to whether the Mayor and Councillors should be attending Anzac Day services in their official capacity.  Burra appeared to be the only place where they did not.  Cr Hammond said it seemed to have been a regrettable oversight where everyone involved thought someone else was attending to it.  Cr Kellaway said previous Anzac Days had been organised by the Mayor and so no official invitations had been sent to Councillors.
