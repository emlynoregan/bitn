Burra Town Council, 16 December.

Rev. R.S. Casely invites the Council to a special Hospital Service at the Kooringa Wesleyan Church on Christmas morning.  Accepted.

The bridge that was washed away recently in East Ward will be replaced as soon as possible for c. £8.

The Council will inspect a small creek in the North Ward near the Chinaman’s garden on Wednesday.

Cr Sampson referred to the auditors’ letter about Cr Rabbich’s statements at the North Ward Ratepayers’ Meeting.  The statements not only affected the auditors in their position as Council auditors, but in outside work as well.  He moved the Council had the fullest confidence in the ability and diligence of the auditors in carrying out their duties.

Cr Rabbich supported the motion.

He said the statements made in the letter were false, but Cr Winnall, having heard Cr Rabbich make use of certain remarks, differed.

Cr Rabbich then opened fire on the Town Clerk, but ‘His Worship distinguished [sic] the luminary at the proper time, so that it did not do any serious damage.’  [Extinguished perhaps?]

Motion carried unanimously.

A discussion was held on whether the officers ought to be appointed for terms from 1 June to 31 May, rather than for the calendar year.  The engineer and scavenger were appointed to 31 May 1896, when new arrangements will be made.

Cr Rabbich said it would be better to have 3 scavengers to distribute the money more widely.

Cr Sampson said it would lead to three Town Clerks and three overseers etc.

The Waterworks were discussed at length, but resolution of the issues was deferred.
