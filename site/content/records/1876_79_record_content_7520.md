Rev. W. Jenkin added a vote of thanks to the Mayor and Council. He admitted that he had last year been a political enemy of Dr Nesbitt, though in no other sense, but he had seen that Dr Nesbitt had attended most thoroughly to his duties and that the best course had been taken in the Fogg affair as further legal action would have just meant a loss for the town. He was grieved by the unemployment in the town in winter and did not know what many would have done but for the work provided by Council.
