Burra Burra Show Inc. AGM

President’s Report.

Regrets the death of D.E. Williams, one of the committee and a great supporter.

The sheep dog trials on 14 & 15 April drew many entries.

All officers were returned unopposed for the coming year.

The annual show in 1940 is scheduled for 28 September, a month earlier than usual.

The 1939 show on 25 October was held on a good day and attendance was good.  Entries were well up to previous years.  Financially on 1 January 1939 the overdraft was £320-7-5 and by 31 December 1939 it had been reduced to £179-18-1.  And with assets of £5,033-4-5 the position is sound.

A large crowd made the annual trip to Sturt Vale and this year’s trip is planned for 8 April when Me Codrington will again be present.

Officers for 1940:	Patron			Charles Bartholomaeus

President		I.J. Warnes

Vice-Presidents	A.B. Riggs & S.H. Robinson
