Obituary.  Mr Arthur John Allen died in Burra Hospital on Thursday aged 75.  He was born in Burra [Hampton] on 6 October 1880 and lived in the town until his death.  He was educated at Burra School and later worked in the Burra North Ballast Quarry.  In the 1890s he married Miss Edith Lihou and they had five children: Myrtle Mrs Hill, Jack, Ida Mrs Laidlaw, Fred and Jean Mrs Motherall (deceased).  After leaving the quarry Mr Allen took up machinery agencies and was a wheat agent at the Railway Station for many years.  In later years he was the Royal Mail contractor for the Eastern Pastoral Area.  He was a keen and active member and supporter of the townâ€™s football clubs.  He was secretary to the Football assoc. for a number of years and was secretary of the Kooringa Football Club when that team won the premiership in 1920.  Although in later years he did not enjoy the best of health, he was active until the time of his death.  His wife predeceased him in 1945.

[Death is registered for 14 September 1955.]
