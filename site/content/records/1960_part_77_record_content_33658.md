Burra Burra DC, 7 March

Chairman G.R. Finch reported on a ratepayersâ€™ meeting at Booborowie, which supported roadside cropping to provide public amenities.  The Booborowie Recreation Committee sent a letter re cropping leases.  Permission was granted for the committee to lease roadsides for cropping as per schedule provided the land cropped be no closer than half a chain from the centre line of road and the lessee is to be responsible for weed control for the term of the lease.  M.T. Carmody requested permission to crop the roadside for Hospital revenue and this was granted.
