Rev. Harry K. Bartlett will show a selection of lantern slides from his time in the South Pacific as a missionary.  Redruth Memorial Hall, Monday 27 July.  They will be of interest as they involve the territory involved in the Battle of the Coral Sea and the country where many of our soldiers and airmen are stationed.
