AGL has secured development rights for a proposed 90-135 megawatt wind farm to add to generating capacity at its existing Hallett peaking power plant.  Evaluation work is continuing in relation to the proposal announced in April 2004 to proceed with a $100 million+ expansion of the gas-fired plant, with a decision due in late 2005.  Construction of the wind farm is scheduled to commence about July 2005, with completion in late 2006.  Integration of the facilities will mean the existing gas-fired generating capacity at Hallett will be able to provide adequate back-up support to the wind farm, enabling continuous operation of the expanded power station during periods of high electricity demand.
