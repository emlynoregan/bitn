Aged Care.

Burra may receive up to four more lower-care aged places out of 24 allocated within the Wakefield Region.  If approved this may see some redevelopment at Burra Hospital to meet Commonwealth standards and providing a home-like environment for nursing home and hostel type residents.  This in turn means that acute services would be separated from the aged care component of the hospital.  No change to acute care is currently being discussed.
