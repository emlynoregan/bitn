S.J. Woollacott writes endorsing the desirability of launching a fund to save the old mine buildings and also that it be administered by the Burra Branch of the National Trust so that donations would be tax deductible.  He appeals for widespread support, repeating the oft-used phrase ‘Burra once saved South Australia’ – now it is time for South Australians to save part of Burra.  He was willing to start the fund with a donation of $5.00.
