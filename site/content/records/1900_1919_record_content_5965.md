The Coronation & the King’s Illness.

News was received the day before the coronation that the King was seriously ill and required an operation which was successful.  [Or as the paper said so far successful]  The coronation was postponed indefinitely, but expected in a few weeks if the King continued to improve in health. [It was appendicitis.]

The King’s illness caused some changes to the Children’s Demonstration, but news arrived too late to cancel it.  The special addresses and hymns to be sung at the Institute had to be abandoned.  The morning was cold with drizzling rain, but nothing could discourage the children on such a day, so they wound their way to the Burra School ‘with light hearts and cold feet’.  Several schools held their own celebrations, but in all some 800 children assembled and marched to the Institute amid numerous flags.

The Mayor, E.W. Crewes, addressed them at Market Square and told of the changes to the program due to the illness of the King.  They sang the National Anthem.  They then marched to Victoria Park where various games were enthusiastically entered into.  A saveloy and a roll for each child were well received.  Rev. T.B. Anguin gave the address for the day.  A stall had been arranged to provide refreshments for the public at everyday rates to the benefit of the Burra Jubilee Benevolent Soc.  Some £10-5-0 was raised.  The sun drove off the fog about lunch time and the afternoon was delightful.  At about 4 p.m. the final bag of treats was handed to each child.  In the evening an intercessory meeting was held and prayers offered for the King’s speedy recovery.  Amusements planned were abandoned.

The Burra Jubilee benevolent Soc. benefited by £22 raised by the Band concerts and by £10 [from the Children’s Demonstration] and this money will be much needed as there is much poverty presently in the town.
