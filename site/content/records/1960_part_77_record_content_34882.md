The ‘Murdered by a German’ Tombstone

The Burra tombstone which has perhaps aroused most interest reads:

ERECTED

HIS BROTHER SEAMEN

TO THE MEMORY OF

JOHN SMITH

OF LONDON AGED 20 YEARS

WHO WAS MURDERED

BY A GERMAN

IN THE TOWNSHIP OF KOORINGA

ON CHRISTMAS EVE

1849

‘Murders in the mining town were not altogether uncommon.’

Burra in 1849 had a population of some 4,000 and was a roaring town of eleven inns with hard drinking bullockies and hard working miners in crude dugout homes in the banks of Burra Creek, of an incredible mixture of wild Irish teamsters, of hard drinking and hard fighting Cornishmen, tough Welsh and German smelters and an even more incredible mixture of the dialects from every part of Wales, Scotland and Cornwall according to a visitor of 1849.  Christmas Eve was traditionally a time for letting off steam in the mining town.  Christmas Eve was one of the few holidays granted by SAMA.  Bare-fisted fights and traditional Cornish wrestling matches took place each year, generally behind the one-storied Miners’ Arms Hotel (now the Burra Hotel in Market Square).  Sometimes as many as 500 miners came to watch the action.  Fights would be coming off all the afternoon and evening, a ring formed and kept by three policemen, powerless to do anything but watch for fair play.  There was no 6 o’clock closing and often no Sunday closing.  It is no wonder the gaol behind the Redruth Police Station had to be enlarged and a new one built in 1856.  Violence was always possible on such occasions and on Christmas Eve 1849 it led to murder.

Mr W. (Bill) R. Marchant, son of the late Jack Marchant of Hanson, returned recently to Burra and visited the cemetery.  He was following up a hunch that his great-uncle Mr T.B. Marchant aged 33 of Mannanarie, who was killed in a fall from a horse in 1854, while riding from Mannanarie to Burra, might be buried in the Burra Cemetery.  He found the grave and headstone of his great-uncle and noted that unusually for a headstone the name was preceded by ‘Mr’.  He also noticed the John Smith headstone and decided to look up the story.

The SA Government Gazette of January 1850 records that a murder lately occurred at Kooringa, committed by a German named Gottlieb Kiernall.  The deceased was a runaway sailor from the Macedon and he came to the German’s house and asked for a light for his pipe.  A lighted candle was handed to him, but being intoxicated he let it fall and it went out.  He insisted on another light, which was refused and the door closed.  He forced it open using threatening language to the German, who then threw a stool at him and then several items were thrown by both sides.  The German then suddenly picked up an axe and struck Smith on the head and repeated the blow, killing Smith almost instantly.  The case was investigated by Mr Lane, who committed Kiernall for trial.

This was held in Adelaide 1 March 1850.

The SA Register newspaper reported that the judge in summing up said it was a sad case and the jury would have to consider what motive the prisoner had.  There appeared to be great provocation.  The deceased had thrown stones and threatened or attempted to set fire to the prisoner’s home.  The jury had to consider how far the provocation reduced the sentence.  After twenty minutes the jury returned a verdict of manslaughter.  The judge agreed with the verdict and sentenced Kiernall to be transported beyond the seas for seven years.  This meant to be sent to the Penal Settlement in Tasmania.
