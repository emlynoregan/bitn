Allison Barckey, an exchange student from Riverton, New Jersey, who is at Burra High School and staying with John & Bev. Dewhirst at Booborowie, makes some observations:

At home we learn to be more independent and here the teachers outline what is important.  At home we are given more assorted material and each must judge for himself or herself what is important.  At home I go to a private co-ed school drawn from a select group of the community.  At BHS there is a wider range and variety of people.  At home it is usual to change rooms and class levels for every class.  Here there seems to be little academic pressure among fellow students.  Living in the country is different too.  The atmosphere is relaxed, but with a quiet air of growth and change.  It has all been very fascinating and exciting and I cannot discover all I would like in my ten week stay.
