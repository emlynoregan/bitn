Mongolata Goldfield

Reprint from The Mail, Adelaide.

Less than four years ago Mongolata was a peaceful country place with no activity, then gold was discovered and since then £45,000 worth of gold has been taken and about 100 miners are scattered over the area digging out the precious ore.  The only machine to help miners is the air compressor of Byles’ Mongolata GM Co.  This company has taken more than £20,000 worth and paid £9,000 in wages and after other expenses has returned to its shareholders £3,642 in three dividends.

Those connected with the field consider it warrants diamond drilling to explore it further and needs an organised scheme for its development.  At present about 120 men are engaged in scattered groups, all getting gold and the battery is working 12 hours a day.

Recently W. Pexton put through 110 tons for 378oz at an average 3½oz per ton.  It is high quality and the Melbourne Mint increased the weight to 388oz to bring it to standard value.  Mr Pexton has some £3,000 worth of specimens in safe deposit.
