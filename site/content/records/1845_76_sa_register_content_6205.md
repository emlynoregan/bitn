‘Kooringa, Monday Evening, 12th May, 1851.

We are all afloat here, the heavy rains which have fallen the last few days, assisted by the immense drain last night and to-day, hade deluged us; Commercial-street (the principal one in the township) has all the appearance of a huge river running through the township into the Burra creek with the force of Niagara!  Empty casks, large logs of wood, and even a dray floated down the street at a railway pace.  The Creek presents a fearful sight; the water rose in half an hour to an unprecedented height, and those occupying huts excavated in its banks are at this moment floating their furniture out of the holes they have lived in.  Live stock, in the shape of fowls, ducks, and pigs, are going down the Creek for the fastest; and men are seen carrying away little pigs, women and children in all directions, to escape the impending fate of all those who for want of assistance must await the dreaded result of this formidable overflow.  It is reported that an infant belonging to someone living in the creek has met with a watery grave, but of this I can only speak from hearsay.  The goods in the stores and cellars of several tradesmen have already suffered much damage.  It is estimated by the manager of Messrs Boord Brothers’ establishment at Kooringa that their firm will suffer in this instance a loss amounting to upwards of £300.  I can only account for the sudden rush of water on this occasion by the hardness of the surface land, arising from the long absence of rain and the consequent impenetrability of the high grounds in the district, thus causing the waters falling on the surrounding hills to flow almost undiminished down to the valley in which the town is situated.’
