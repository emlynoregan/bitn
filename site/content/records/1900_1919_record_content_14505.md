Paull’s Consolidated Mine.

There is a little over 1 column report on this mine which is some 20 miles N-E of Leigh Creek.  Mr C.A. Fuss, one of the directors, reported to interested shareholders on Wednesday at the Institute.  Mr Winnall presided.  A recent visit convinced Mr Fuss that the mine had a bright future.  He expected recent ore to show 22% copper.  Various shafts have been sunk and samples suggest a large lode of good quality ore.  A larger plant is expected to be in use in about six months.  There are 600 shares in the company.  Cartage from Leigh Creek is £1 a ton, but less if back loading becomes available.  Rail costs 16/10 per ton to Wallaroo and smelting a trifle over £2 per ton.  The new plant is expected to cost £500.  20 men are currently employed.
