Morphett’s Enginehouse.  The restored/new balconies were officially opened on Friday 16 February.  About 50 people were there to witness the event.  Long-time National Trust volunteer, Helen Stockman and Goyder Mayor Peter Mattey each cut a ribbon to open the two balconies.  The view from the balconies is superb.
