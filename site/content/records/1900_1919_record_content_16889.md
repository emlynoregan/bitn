'Short & Sharp'

Scarlatina & colds are common in Burra at present.

Mr F.W. Liebing, a former teacher at Burra School and lately of Jamestown is said to be going to resign from the Department at Easter.

Rev. Wightwick has returned to England with 250 lantern slides to assist in talks about Australia.  [They were made by the Burra Record.]

Cricket.  At Victoria Park on Saturday Mongolata 148 v. Gum Creek 94.

Mrs Gerald Dow has survived a very serious operation in North Adelaide for the removal of a growth in the throat.

Mr Cyril McBride, eldest son of W. McBride, left Burra for Perth a few days ago.  He had been employed at Drew & Crewes.  He was a member of St Mary’s Choir, the Burra Orchestra and the Burra Musical & Dramatic Club.

Obituary.  R.Z. Jones has died aged 81.  He was a schoolteacher at Stony Gap for a number of years and later lived in a house now almost demolished in Commercial St.  He moved to Adelaide and then to Jamestown, where he lived with his son.  Mrs Jones died some eight years ago.  John, the youngest son, served his time as a printer at the Burra Record and is now in WA.

[Robert Zincraft Jones died at Jamestown 29 March 1906 aged 82.]

Mr J.C. Killicoat left Burra on Monday for Jamestown where he will conduct Messrs Strachan, Cheadle & Co.’s auctioneering branch.  He was a valued member of St Mary’s Choir, the Burra Musical & Dramatic Club and was on the committee of the Burra Racing Club.  He has been secretary to numerous dances and was a most efficient master-of-ceremonies.

Burra Town Council held a special meeting on 26 March and decided to take no action concerning the purchase of the slaughterhouse to be auctioned during April.  An ordinary meeting on Monday conducted routine business.

Accident.  Two horses attached to Mt Tom Halls’ cab became fractious at the station and after some interaction with Edwin Harris’s horse and dray they brought the cab into contact with the corner fence post damaging the cab considerably.

Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co.

A large belt wheel was cracked when it fell off the trolly because the horses moved and it had to be repaired at Henderson’s.  On Saturday the first run of the engine was made and it worked silently and beautifully.  We expect the bottom of the pool to be exposed at about 20ft.  Pumping should begin in about three weeks.  When we [Mr Davey] visited the Mine Mr Pryor ordered us away from the site and refused to talk to us.  But if we did not go to the Mine to see for ourselves the shareholders would have to rely on the information released by Mr Pryor and would not know the true state of affairs.  At present there is nothing showing that gives promise of anything valuable from a mineral point of view.  Work at Bunts’s Shaft continues and the intention of management is to get below the old workings.
