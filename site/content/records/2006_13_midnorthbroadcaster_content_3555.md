Goyder Waste Disposal.  CEO Stephen Kerrigan said the Council was looking to retain Hallett, but transform Burra & Eudunda sites to transport stations.  At the end of 2007-08 it is expected all other sites will close and those three would be developed into transport stations.

Peterborough CWA decided to close after its August meeting, ending 75 years of community service.
