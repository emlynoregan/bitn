Howell said he would rather go to jail than pay.

The bailiff had then seized the items as above.

The bailiff then claimed that Mrs Howell urged her husband to get a gun and shoot them and then get an axe and kill the horse – stick them with a knife.

Mrs Howell continually interrupted the evidence with dramatic gestures and exclamations of denial and was ultimately threatened with removal to the back of the court.

The bailiff offered to go to Mr Barker’s to ascertain the ownership of the horse – Mrs Howell insisted on accompanying him, riding with the two bailiffs in their buggy.  Howell followed with the dray.

On the way they stopped at Mr Jones’s at Mongolata and at his invitation had dinner.  Mrs Howell objected that she was left in the trap all the while.  After dinner the bailiff found that the Howells had gone off in the dray.  They followed the dray tracks into the hills and found Mrs Howell sitting in the dray in the ranges.  Mrs Howell interrupted to say it was on a three chain road short cut to Barker’s.  They went on and near Barker’s met with Howell coming back to say that Barker was not home.  The bailiffs decided to go into Burra.  Mrs Howell tried to eject the assistant bailiff from the dray and Howell seized the horse and tried to unfasten the reins.

Mr W. Moore, who had been picked up at Jones’s and was the son of E.A. Moore, the assistant bailiff, helped to restrain Howell who then rushed to the side of the horse and tried to unfasten the trace.

Mrs Howell suggested they go to see Mrs Barker and examine Mr Barker’s cheque book [as evidence of his ownership of the horse.]

They went to Mr Barker’s where Mr Giles ordered Mr Moore to drive the dray to Burra.  Howell again tried to unfasten the reins.  W. Moore then held Howell while the dray was driven off and Moore then made a run for the trap with Giles and they drive off with Howell heaving a large stone at them.

The cross examination by the Howells was dramatic and rather frenetic and in the end profitless for them.

E.A. Moore, the assistant bailiff gave evidence confirming that of Giles, the bailiff and W. Moore’s evidence was corroborative.

Mrs Howell said she was in bed very, very ill on 12 January and got up when Giles arrived.

She claimed ‘They have taken all I had . . . By burning me out and taking me to court.’

(Clarified after objection – that the ‘they’ of the burning were in fact unknown.)

She claimed that Giles had insisted on her going with them to Baker’s [whereas his evidence had her insisting on coming along.]

M-C Jemison, who was acting as court recorder complained that he couldn’t keep up with either the dramatics of Mrs Howell or the objections of Mr Winnall.  ‘I don’t know who is the biggest nuisance Mr Winnall or the defendant.’

After an amusing discussion about the absent witnesses, none of whom except the Barker girls had actually seen any of the critical actions, the case ended having given four hours of entertainment for the gallery.

The bench found the Howells guilty and fined them £1 + £4-8-0 costs.

Mr Winnall – What about the non-payment of the fine?

Bench – Can you pay the money?

Mrs Howell – No we can’t.

Bench – One month to pay or 14 days in jail.

Mrs Howell – ‘Do you arrest me now; take me as I am.’

‘The crowd left the Court feeling that they had been highly entertained.’
