Ratepayers’ Meeting, Thursday 26 November.

There was a large attendance with Mr Winnall in the chair.

Mr [C.] Fuss moved a vote of thanks for the retiring Councillors.

Mr Crewes said he would gladly retire in favour of another candidate, but as none had come forward he was willing to continue.  He referred to his report for the year.  He was glad to have upset the unsatisfactory electric light scheme proposed for £2,500, but would work towards an efficient scheme which would probably cost £5,000, but would light the whole town.  He thought the rates should be: General 1/-, Health 6d, Park Lands 3d and Lighting 3d.  The cemetery now had 960 vacant blocks.  He was glad to say the Council in 1914 had worked very amicably.  The tar-paving had been an unqualified success and would certainly be extended.

Mr Thomas McWaters promised do what the electors wanted.  (He had 25 years experience with the District Council before moving into town to live.)

A.J. McBride felt he could soon learn about municipal matters and would do his best.

C.D. Wilkinson said something similar.

J.C. Killicoat as candidate for North Ward thought the Aberdeen post office issue should be revisited.  He had experience of electric light and believed most schemes had failures due to lack of horsepower in their engines.  A fire brigade was very necessary.

Cr Walker would not like to leave the Council while the North Ward was in debt.

Mr J. Richards asked if candidates would get the dangerous ruins of the German Church torn down as they were ‘hanging over four feet’.

Mr Bevan said other premises were hanging over the footpath three feet.

The Mayor advised that all nuisances should be drawn to the attention of the Inspector.  He said the structure known as ‘Dead Man’s Bridge’ on Cemetery Rd was a disgrace.  The intention was to continue the road in front of Mr McWaters and put a new bridge in line with the present road.  The problem was funding.
