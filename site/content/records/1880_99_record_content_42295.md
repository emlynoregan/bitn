‘Sparks’ Column.  [The following extracts give a taste of the cryptic nature that often makes this column frustrating reading more than a century later.]

The stolen rope

An early marriage

Muffs colours are green

Rabbits on tee [sic] increase

No rain yet to fill dams

Try Unicorn bottled beer

Father’s come back again

Camelback on Friday last

Caterpillars in the eastern country

Can I get my hair cut here please?

Who sent that paper to Harry Vivian?

A great run on monckey [sic] soap for cleaning accoutrements of Mounted Infantry

The squatter’s life is not always a happy one – drought, locusts, rabbits and caterpillars

Councillor S – I know as much about, nonsense as you do

Councillor R – I don’t know if you do, and His Worship smiled

[Some comments make independent sense, some do so in the light of other articles, but some are destined to remain enigmas.]
