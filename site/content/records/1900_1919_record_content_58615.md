‘Koonoowarra’  Here the woolshed with two years’ seed wheat, a winnower, wool tables, etc. was destroyed along with six sheep.  Also lost were a calf, sheep yards, three large loads of firewood and two large haystacks valued at £300 each.  The stock had been mustered and run to fallow land, which left no time to save equipment, except for some harness from the harness room.  The cottage of the overseer, Mr Duell, was saved.  Here even the timber lining of the well was burnt to water level.  Fortunately a recent fire had burnt around the homestead allowing it and the large implement shed to be saved.  Poultry was largely killed by smoke without even being singed.  Damage is at least £3,000.
