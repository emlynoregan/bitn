Obituary/Inquest.  An inquest was held by Mr MacDermott on Friday afternoon at the Miners’ Arms on the causes for the death of W.H. Birbeck, an old and well-known resident of Kooringa.

Emma Nethick:

Went yesterday to the deceased’s office to get my husband’s club-card.  Got no response when I knocked, but could hear some noises inside.  Called Miss Splane and told her I thought Mr Birbeck was having a fit.  Looked through the keyhole and saw Mr Birbeck on his right knee.  Mr Splane and Mr Dawson came and sent for the police.

Police Trooper Hunter:

On arrival at the deceased’s office I broke a pane of glass in the window, opened it and gained entrance.  Saw deceased on his back on the floor and sent for a doctor.  The body was lying apparently dead without any signs of contortions.  Unlocked the door and Mr Splane, Mr Dawson and some others entered.  There was a tumbler under the table, a piece of paper on the table and two letters in a pocket book; one addressed to the N.G. of the Burra Lodge and the other to Mr Johnson.

The letters were read; they said goodbye to his friends, commended his family to their benevolence and made some reference to Lodge affairs, but said nothing directly of his intention to kill himself.

[Hunter went on to describe searching the clothing of the deceased and that he had found that the chemists (Dyer & Wilkinson) had not sold the deceased poison.  Deceased’s wife had some drugs in the house, but believed he had not known where they were.  She said the deceased had often complained of heart disease.]

Henry Dawson:

Saw deceased enter his office at about 12.30 p.m.  About two minutes later went to talk to him and found the door locked.  Asked him to open it and he did so.  There was half a glass of water on the table.  Spoke with him for about half an hour, during which time Greenwood and Mardon dropped by for a few minutes.  Deceased had complained of a pain in his chest during the day.  Am aware the deceased had been troubled by money matters for the last three months and there was an affair he had to settle last night.  There was some deficiency in the cash for which he was responsible as Secretary of the Lodge.  The amount was under £20 and I know he could not make it up, though he said he thought he could get it by the evening.

[The rest of Dawson’s evidence and that of Mr William Splane largely corroborates that already given.  John Potter, a spirit merchant, believed he was the last to see the deceased alive at about 3 p.m., but noticed nothing of significance.]

Dr Morgan:

Upon seeing the deceased he appeared to be dead.  As a precaution applied a stomach pump and artificial respiration, but to no avail.  The glass appeared to have held only a colourless liquid.  If a poison, it could only have been acidulated alcohol.  There was no sign or smell of a drug about the mouth.  A post mortem revealed all organs were in good condition except the heart, which showed disease of long standing and the brain, which was extremely congested.  The heart disease could have caused the congestion of the brain, which I believe was the cause of death.  If a poison had been used only a salt of morphia would have caused congestion of the brain.  While there is no evidence for such a poison in the bottles produced, I am unable to say whether the fatal congestion of the brain was caused by the heart condition or by poison.

Augustus Johnson said he was a close friend of the deceased and had known him to have suffered heart disease for some time.

Josiah Dennis, one of the Lodge auditors, explained some matters in connection with the cash defalcations of the deceased.

The Coroner is summing up remarked that there was no direct evidence  that poison had been taken by the deceased and if the jury were of that opinion they would return a verdict of ‘Died by the visitation of God’.  It was up to them to decide.

The Jury returned a verdict ‘That the deceased died from congestion of the brain, supposed to have been caused by the taking of poison.’

[William Henry Birbeck died 26 June 1862 at Kooringa aged 36.  SA Births CD suggests that he left a widow, Elizabeth nee Wright and four surviving sons born between 1852 and 1860.]
