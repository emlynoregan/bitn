James Tiver JP celebrated his 77th birthday last week.  He has lived in Burra for 51 years.  Mr Tiver with Mr Thomas Burgoyne placed the first bridge over the Redruth Creek, [the Burra Creek at Redruth] built the first Wallaroo Smelters in conjunction with Messrs Pulsford and the late David Bower, the first public house in Kadina, the first woolshed at Gum Creek, the first house for Alex McCulloch at Gottlieb’s Well [South of Terowie: Parnggi Well since 1918.] and had many large contracts in the northeast.  He has had the Aberdeen store for over 30 years.  He has five sons and five daughters – all married.  He and his wife are still hale and hearty and he is a typical Welshman standing something like 6ft and his sons and daughters are also tall.
