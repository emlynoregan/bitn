Obituary.  Mary Hardy, widow of the late W.H. Hardy of Burra, died in Adelaide on 20 February aged 79.

Mrs Hardy was born at Wirrabara 30 May 1861, the eldest daughter of the late Mr & Mrs W. Kroncke of Kooringa.  The family moved to Burra in her girlhood.  She later married Mr W.H. Hardy and lived in Burra until just before her death.  Thirty years ago she suffered a stroke and lost the use of her left arm.  Upon recovering, she did not allow this disability to affect her life and [after Mr Hardyâ€™s death in 1916] she lived alone until old age forced her to give up her home and reside with her daughter Mrs Bert Opperman.  From time to time she made periodic visits to other family members.  Prior to her death she had been staying with her daughter Mrs Winzer of Adelaide.  Until poor health intervened she had been connected with the Kooringa Methodist Church of which she was a regular attendant.  She had a family of 14 children, 11 of whom survive: Nell Mrs Ryan (Adelaide), Esther Mrs Bert Opperman (Burra North), George Hardy (Plympton), Vera Mrs Findlay (Adelaide), Annie Mrs A. Winzer (Adelaide), Marion Mrs Davey (Sydney), Ettie Mrs Drabsch (Adelaide), Stella Mrs F. Innes (Adelaide), Jean Mrs Drage (Pt Pirie), May Mrs McGee and Will Hardy (Adelaide).  There are 33 grandchildren and several great-grandchildren.  Her eldest daughter, Lily Mrs Bert Wise of Katanning WA died about two years ago and a son and daughter died in infancy.

A grandson Pte Rex Opperman is in the 2nd AIF and son-in-law Pte McGee is a member of the Medical Corp in Palestine.  She was buried in Burra on Friday.
