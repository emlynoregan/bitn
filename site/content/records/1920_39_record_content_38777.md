Mr & Mrs R. Bruce of Thames St celebrated their golden wedding on 9 July, but the social celebrations took place on 18 July with a family reunion at their residence.  Mr Bruce has been married three times.  From his third marriage all eight children attended.  The daughter of his first marriage Mrs Turley of Broken Hill was unable to attend.  He married his present wife on 9 July 1881.  The ceremony was conducted by Rev. A.J. Burt (now of Sydney, but then of the Primitive Methodist Church in Kooringa) at the home of the bride’s parents Mr & Mrs William Prior of World’s End.  The bride was their second daughter, Hannah.  Along with their four sons and four daughters the reunion brought together a number of grandchildren, great-grandchildren and other relatives.  Mr Bruce who is 89 only recently visited Broken Hill.  Mr Bruce was born 9 March 1842 in Northampton to Scottish parents, his father being a sergeant in the Grenadier Guards 11th Regiment who had fought in the Indian War.  In 1847 his father was a guard on a shipload of convicts sent to Tasmania and his wife and family came too.  They then went to Sydney and after he had completed his military service his father brought the family to Adelaide where Mr Bruce attended Pulteney Grammar School where the late W.B. Rounsevell was a school mate.  His father was then employed at the Wakefield by the English Copper Co. and Mr Bruce Sen. died there in the time of the Crimean War.  Mr Bruce Jnr then continued in the company’s employ in charge of the mules carting ore from the Burra Mine and was also a teamster for the Wallaroo & Moonta Copper Co.  The family then came to the Burra District where Mr Bruce was a teamster for the old Booborowie Station for seven years before taking a farm in the Light District.  Later he returned to this district; first to Flagstaff and then to World’s End where he farmed until retiring to Kooringa in 1923.  The family present were: Hannah Mrs J. Byles (Morgan), Ethel Mrs P. Marks (Meningie), Elaine Mrs S. Rawlings (Broken Hill), Elizabeth Mrs A. Hunt (Pt Pirie), R.W. Bruce (Burra), Albert J. Bruce (Burra), Colin Bruce (Burra), Joe Bruce (Oulnina Station and 19 grandchildren and 32 great-grandchildren.  [Richard Hamilton Bruce.]
