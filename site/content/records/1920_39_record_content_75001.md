F.T. Sara said he had heard of virtually no opposition to the change.

The amendment to use Burra Burra was carried on the casting vote of the Chairman S. Kellaway.

Rev. Andrews then moved Aberdeen post office be North Burra Burra.

Mr Riggs moved an amendment to North Burra and after discussion this was carried.

R. Humphrys then said it would be less confusing to call Kooringa Burra in that case and on the meeting agreeing to reconsider the matter it was agreed to change Kooringa to Burra.

The Mayor said the Council would move to implement the change as soon as possible.
