Agriculture.  The rains have come and grass has clothed the pastures.  There is hope for the next harvest.  Farmers are busy ploughing and harrowing and sowing, while those who acted early have wheat that is springing up nicely.

Burra Mine is currently employing about 200.  At the last ‘take’ some 300 tons of ore was dressed and the present ‘take’ expects to see about 400 tons.  It has all been dressed by hand and the aid of stamps.  Mr Darlington’s machine is still out of order.

Kooringa.  The township of Kooringa is rapidly filling up and old cottages are being put in order.  The Directors visited last week and have made several concessions to the tenants, which have put the latter in good heart.

On Whit Monday shops were closed at noon and many took advantage of the half-holiday to go to the cricket ground where a match was played between the married and the single, ending in a victory for the former.

On the same day the Bible Christian Sunday School celebrated its Anniversary.  Mr Rock, the resident minister conducted the services.  Mr William Davey has conducted the singing there for many years.

The Mount Razorback Wesleyan Chapel was opened near Mt Bryan by Rev. Stephenson on Whit Sunday.
