The Burra Council denies it ever agreed to do the Market St work to the satisfaction of the Road Board surveyor, though they accept a moral obligation to hand it back in at least as good a condition as they took it.  They have done more than this.  In fact on Commercial St and Market St the Council has expended £400 over the £400 special grant.  The Board has in fact withheld maintenance on those streets far beyond the sum used in covering the Board’s road in Commercial St, so that maintenance is still due on those roads.  Therefore the Council does not believe the Board will require them to do the very unusual amount of metalling required by the surveyor and hope the road will at once be placed under the care of the Board’s officers.  The Mayor and Cr Batchelor did not agree (as the Board has stated) to Mr Duffy’s requests, but only that the conditions of the contract should be fulfilled.  Mr Lane then explained the matter in some detail from the Council’s point of view.
