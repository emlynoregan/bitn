Redruth Court 20 June.

The Kotz v. Kielow case continued.  Adolph Alfred Kotz, father of the complainant, gave evidence he had seen the incident.  Theodor Kotz, aged c. 11 corroborated the evidence as did Clara Kotz, aged 9.

Mr Winnall, for the defence, asked for a dismissal on the grounds that the informant’s evidence had been most unsatisfactory and had been considerably corrected.  The evidence of the so-called witnesses was clearly unreliable.  They claimed to have heard a conversation at 350 yds.  Only one shot from the gun had touched the informant and it was reasonable to believe it was not direct but had dropped onto the informant’s shoulder.  The bench thought there was a case to answer.  The accused did not desire to give evidence.  Augusta Pauline Kielow gave evidence with a different version of the shots and said there were shot marks in her son’s hat that had not been there in the morning.  Eventually the case was dismissed with each side to pay its own costs.
