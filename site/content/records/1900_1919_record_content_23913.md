Obituary/Memorial Service for the late Jesse Humphrys: conducted on Sunday 11 April at the Wesley Bicentenary Church, Hanson by Rev. W.F. James.

Jesse Humphrys was born at Hassage, Somerset on 2 January 1835 to a large working class family.  He married Miss Flower, sister of Joseph Flower of Stony Gap and reached SA with his wife’s parents in 1854.  He worked for a few years for Joseph Turner at the Reed Beds and then for a few years on land he took up at Port Gawler.  He then moved to Stony Gap where he served as a Councillor and Chairman of the Apoinga DC and helped to build a hall for temperance and other meetings and also for church services and day and Sunday schools.  While at Stony Gap his wife and mother of ten children died and sixteen months later he married Mrs Turner of Black Springs who died in November 1902.  He let his farm to the Hon. W. Duffield & Mr Makin for 21 years and bought a farm near Hanson from Thomas Glasson and remained there till his death.

He was converted in 1862 under the ministry of Rev. T. Lloyd at ‘The Gums’ and the next Sunday walked 10 miles to Kooringa to hear Mr Lloyd preach.  For many years he was the leading man in the Hanson Home Mission of the Redruth Circuit.  For 25 years he and others worshipped in the Council Chamber where his eight sons and daughters were converted.  He was class leader and superintendent of the Sunday school at Hanson.  In 1899 Mr Humphrys put £20 into a savings account to start a church building fund.  A trust was formed and a 2-acre property was secured in Hanson, though little tangible activity took place for three years.  Rev. H.J. Pope, President of Conference laid one of two memorial stones and Mr Humphrys the other and on Good Friday 1904 the church known as Wesley Bicentenary Church was opened.  It had cost £315 and was free of debt.  Mr Humphrys was regarded as the father of Hanson.  He never fully recovered from a severe operation about four years ago and he died at Burra Hospital on 19 February 1909.  He desired to see a grand revival and to get a Sunday school hall built at Hanson and he offered £40 towards the latter.  Rev. James called for an account to be opened to build free of debt, the Jesse Humphrys Memorial Hall to stand alongside the Wesley Bicentenary Church and the meeting carried a resolution to effect that.  One of Mr Humphrys’ sons has promised £50 towards the new hall.
