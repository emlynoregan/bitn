Woolgrowers met in Burra last week and voted 107 to 30 to support moves to alter the fixed selling schedule of the wool stockpile to a more flexible strategy.  Countrywide the move has 90% support.  In the last six years the combination of drought and the stockpile has seen sheep numbers fall from 150 to 120 million.
