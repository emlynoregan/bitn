Local Court, 17 March.

W.G. Neville, landlord of the Royal Exchange Hotel, was charged with having in his possession a bottle of brandy alleged to be less than 25% underproof.

Over half a column of evidence in detail is reported showing that the Inspector was unable to explain the procedure for deciding if it was less than 25% underproof and the case was dismissed with costs.
