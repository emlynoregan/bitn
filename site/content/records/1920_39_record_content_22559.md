Burra Show Society

President I.J. Warnes reported on 7 March at the AGM.

He regretted the death of Mr Joseph Flower in the year and thanked members for re-electing himself as President for a further year unopposed.  The annual show on 26 & 27 October was again very successful.  Entries were a record.  Sheep entries were one of the largest ever and there are plans now to erect a sheep shed – perhaps at a cost of up to £1,000, but the committee will not go ahead without a considerable sum in hand from donations.  The show’s progress can be charted in its income:

[Much of which is from subscriptions.]    1919    £333

1920    £325

1921    £310

1922    £333

1923    £427

1924    £498

1925    £656

1927    £713

In 1926 subscriptions were £416-17-0, Entry Fees were £19-13-0, and the Gate was £276-15-6 for a total of £713-5-6.

Application has been made for 7 & 8 October for this year’s show.

The financial position is satisfactory.  Assets over liabilities £3,430-16-4.

The overdraft is £391-15-6.  [A detailed financial statement is printed.]

Improvements for the last year were the erection of a Fruit Shed, Dog Housing, Fowl Housing and the laying on of water all over the ground.  Last year over £600 was spent and this year £214-18-7.

A caretaker has been appointed.  Elected were Patron, C. Bartholomaeus; President, I.J. Warnes (for the 13th year); Vice-Presidents, M.A. Radford & S.H. Robinson.
