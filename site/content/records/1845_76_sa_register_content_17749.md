Kooringa News, 25 August

The roads have been so bad that several times recently the mail has been late.

The total amount gathered during the events to mark the Wesleyan Missionary Society Jubilee was almost £300.

Storekeepers are wondering if the Government will be as liberal in their terms to the squatters in renewing leases as the SA Mining Association are with their tenants.

In their case the more valuable one makes their property the more one has to pay for it should one desire a renewal of the lease.  On the other hand should it be a losing bargain, the lease is quietly dropped and very seldom is anything more heard of it.  The company’s remedy then is to pull the house down or let it for a low rental.
