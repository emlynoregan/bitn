The Burra Hospital Ball on Friday in Burra Town Hall was a wonderful success with door takings of $312 and donations of $52.  These, with a competition and prior ticket sales ensured a profit of $220.  This will attract a two for one subsidy making it effectively $660.  The ball was organised by nine staff members with Nurse R. McDonald as Secretary and Nurse W. Anderson as Treasurer.  [The report extends for Â¾ column.]
