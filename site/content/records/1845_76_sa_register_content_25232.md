Saddleworth Railway Meeting.   The meeting was held 25 June.  The report comes from the Northern Argus.

Delegates were sent from Burra (Killicoat, Dawson & Drew), Hanson, Clare, Saddleworth, Auburn, Tarlee, Rhynie, Waterloo, Mintaro and Riverton.  Captain Killicoat chaired the meeting.

Captain Killicoat said they effectively had only one train a day because the first did not carry third class passengers and the second did not carry first and second class passengers.

Mr Dawson called for immediate and radical change, saying, ‘that in no country in the world except here did it take eight and a quarter hours to travel 100 miles.’

Mr Moule proposed there be a morning and evening train each day for first, second and third class passengers and for the mail.

Mr Faulkner moved for the abolition of the fortnightly pay train.  The first train should stay as long as possible at Burra, leaving in time to catch the Kapunda midday train at Gawler.

Mr Hosier said the run between Burra and Adelaide should be done in 4½ hours.  It should leave Burra about 7 a.m. and Adelaide about 4 p.m.

A reduction in tariffs was discussed, but in the end it was deemed inadvisable to ask for that at present.

A proposal that each station on the line should have a goods shed was carried.

A deputation was elected to wait on the Commissioner of Public Works.
