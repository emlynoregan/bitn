Burra Town Council, 21 April.

The Postmaster-General advises that lighting at the Kooringa Post Office will be attended to.

SAR will further investigate the safety of the Bon Accord crossing.

Cr Walker gave notice of a motion to plant the three-cornered plot opposite the Royal Exchange Hotel.

Cr Parks reported that 150 trees were needed for West Ward.

Cr Walker said his ward needed the same number as last year (about 100), as all last season’s had died.

Council decided to order 500 trees.

R. Turner applied for a motorcar licence.  By-laws don’t cover this and information is to be sought from the Adelaide City Council.

[Judging from his advertisements this meant a licence to operate as a hire car or cab, rather than a licence to drive as such.]
