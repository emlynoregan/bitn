Council Tourism Policy

A public meeting at Burra Courthouse on Monday night called on the Council’s Resource Committee to produce a comprehensive business plan for the main individual tourist sites.  It has been asked that the plans show short term break-even points and eventual financial and community benefits.  About 150 people attended and local tradesman Alan Hall laid down the rules that allowed Council members, Chairman Graham Kellock, Tourism Resource Committee Chairperson Colleen Woodgate and Finance Chairman Jim Quinn opportunity to respond.

The tourism budget for this year came under close scrutiny.  Colleen Woodgate said the Council was working with the National Trust and Burra Traders Association to establish a Tourism Advisory Committee.

Len Bence said he thought Paxton’s Cottages were well run before the Council took over.

Councillor Quinn said the main hurdle before leasing the Caravan Park and Paxton Square Cottages was the outstanding loans on those sites.

Dick Cleland said as a Bed & Breakfast operator he felt uncomfortable with the Tourist Office acting as a booking agent and promoter of both Council run enterprises and private operators.

Chris Reed pointed out that tourism was estimated some years ago to bring more than $4 million annually into the district.

Andrew Gebhardt said tourism attracted significant federal and state grants – the main problem lay in ongoing staffing costs.

Councillors were pushed on the question:

‘Where do you stop subsidising tourist ventures running at a loss?’
