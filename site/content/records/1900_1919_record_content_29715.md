Burra Town Council, 6 June.

Mrs Smith replied to a letter from Council saying she had no road enclosed at the rear of her residence.

G.E. March similarly replied that the land concerned near the cemetery was not a road and he held a title from SAMA when he purchased.

E.W. Hawker was given permission to erect telephone poles in West Ward.

Thames St footpath and the road to the slaughterhouse are to be repaired.

H. Ockenden, the lamplighter, was given one monthâ€™s notice.

An advertisement was placed for someone to clean and light the lamps at 4/- per lamp per month.
