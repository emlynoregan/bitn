Ian Auhl’s Article on Captain Roach, Part 2

At Burra Captain Roach and fellow captains and office staff lived in a row of cottages overlooking the Mine.

Early in 1867 Roach received a confidential letter from Ayers, by then Sir Henry Ayers and Premier of SA, asking him to inform his brother officers of the suspension of all operations on the mine and than mining would become an open cut operation.

A month later he received a letter informing all officers that their services were no longer required.

At age 59 Roach found himself retired without a pension.

His salary had been since 1854 $900 p.a.

With his savings he bought an allotment in Gover Street, North Adelaide and had three cottages erected.  He was a bachelor and resided in the middle cottage – living on the income from the other two until his death in October 1889.

His funeral service was in the Primitive Methodist Chapel in Wellington Square (now owned by Channel 9).

His cottage is now owned and occupied by Mr & Mrs Murray Docherty and named Uraparinga after their former home at Williamstown.

Captain Roach’s headstone is well preserved, but is leaning precariously and is bare of any surrounds.

I would suggest it be made safe and given a modest surround and I am willing to arrange for this to be done.
