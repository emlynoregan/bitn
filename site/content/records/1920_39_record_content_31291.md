Obituary.  Murdoch Morrison who died on 4 July was a resident of the district for 73 years.  He was born at Inverness Scotland in 1844 and came to SA aged about 11 with his parents in the Royal Albert.  They lived in Adelaide for about a year and then at World’s End where his father tended sheep.  From World’s End Mr Morrison came to Burra and worked as a lad for several business people and then as a horse driver at the Mine.  From there he went to Baldina Station and remained for 18 years working for Mr William Barker, during which time he had many varied experiences with natives who were common out there.  At one time a group from the north camped near Chalk Cliffs and held a corroboree.  Mr Barker and Mr Morrison were invited and enjoyed themselves until the natives started throwing spears at each other.  They were advised to leave and found out later that the group was on its way to attack the Murray natives, but police stepped in and stopped it.  Later he and his brother Norman bought Westbury Farm just behind Flagstaff Hill and farmed it for a number of years.  While there he lost his first wife and his eldest son, Donald, who were accidentally drowned.  They sold eventually to W.H. Field and went to farm at Booborowie.  He retired to Burra in 1895.  His hobby was horses and racing and he trained and raced horses at picnic race meetings in his youth.  His first wife was Miss Jane Lambert and of four children only Christina, Mrs H. Schultz of Salisbury survived.  [This statement was corrected 50, 29, 24 July 1929, page 2 by adding John Morrison of Wilgena.]
