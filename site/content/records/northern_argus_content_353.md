Jubilee 150 Project

The working party reconvened on Friday.

Work remains to be done on the $30,000 Bon Accord Project.

$80,000 has been set aside for the Morphett’s Enginehouse along with $25,000 from the Department of Mines and Energy for the same site.  The building will be re-roofed, stonework repaired and re-pointed, the floors replaced and displays installed.  A partial re-timbering of the shaft is also contemplated.  The $210,000 earmarked for the Copper Interpretation Centre has been re-allocated by the Jubilee 150 Board.
