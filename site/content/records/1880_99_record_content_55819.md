Editorial on The Rabbit Question.

In recent years the rabbit has played havoc with crops and no solution has proved effective.  In 1879 the Rabbit Suppression Act was passed, but oddly in the event of the owner or occupier neglecting to carry out the Act no fine appears to have been provided.  The provision allowing the Government to take action at the owner or occupier’s expense proved unworkable.  Fines were provided for in the Vermin-proof Fencing Act 1890.  This complicated matters at court last Wednesday.  T.H. Pearse was served with a notice to destroy rabbits on 10 July and began operations, which have since continued.  Because he was not on a particular section when the Inspector arrived to examine it he was summoned and fined.  We consider all should be done to destroy rabbits, but when a person spends £130 in three months to do so and is still fined we consider him harshly dealt with.  Simultaneous action across the district is, we believe, needed.  The manager of Princess Royal was similarly dealt with.  The law appears to say one thing and mean another.
