J.C. Sandland writes in support of a stock tax.  He accuses the butchers who oppose it of having vested interests in an unlimited supply of cheap meat from beyond SA so they can sell mutton at 4½d per lb when they pay ½ a head, or beef at 4½d per lb, when it costs them 5/- for 100 lb.  [60d per 100 lb.]  The Holder ministry should hold true to their principles.
