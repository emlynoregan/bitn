Citizens’ Defence League.  A branch of the league was formed in Burra at a meeting in the Council Chamber last Wednesday chaired by Mayor S. Kellaway.  A committee of representatives from all sporting and public bodies was formed.  A meeting is to be held in January when a Staff Officer from headquarters will be asked to address them.  A letter from SA Defence League was read outlining the purposes – essentially the league was a non-political and non-sectarian organisation to promote militia forces and aid the Ministry of defence and act as a link between citizens and Government.
