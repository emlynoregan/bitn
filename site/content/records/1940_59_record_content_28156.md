Burra Burra DC, 5 August

Every effort is to be made to find and use a quarry not infected with noxious weeds.

[Wild onion had become a major concern at Burra North.]

The Burra Town Council enquired about getting footpath gravel from the Ballast Quarry, but at present the crusher there is out of order, so they could not be given an answer.

It was resolved to support Freer & Scottâ€™s application for a Sunday bus service between Burra and Adelaide.
