Redruth Methodist Church Trustees have had a new entrance porch constructed inside the church.  It is built of selected timbers and cathedral glass and is about 8 ft x 9 ft.  It will help exclude noise and drafts and provide a place where wedding groups can assemble and arrange trains etc. and where mothers with small children can sit if not able to remain in the church.  It is fitted with double swing doors and was built by R. Fuss of Burra North.  The architect was Mr Gordon of Adelaide.
