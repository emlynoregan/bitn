Anna Adams is the first Burra Hospital resident to live to be 100 years old.*  She was born in Mt Gambier.  Working as a buyer for Eudunda Farmers in Naracoorte, she met and married her bank manager husband of 71 years, who lived to the age of 95.  Anna moved to Burra five years ago to be closer to family.  She was a keen milliner and dressmaker and made two of her daughters’ wedding dresses and all their bridesmaids’ dresses.  She has three daughters, ten grandchildren and seventeen great-grandchildren.

[*This needs to be read with caution.  If true it may depend on the definition of ‘resident’.]
