Burra Town Council, 17 December.

The Local Government Dept. has forwarded a grant of Â£350.  [Apparently representing a reduced amount for main roads.]

An appeal for a full grant is to be made, as otherwise roads will deteriorate.

The rates were fixed as for 1917.

Cr Radford reported that boys were pulling down a portion of the just repaired wall at Victoria Park.
