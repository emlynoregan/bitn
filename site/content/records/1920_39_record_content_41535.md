H.J. Button writes about the Council’s representation on the Hospital Board, stating that the result of the situation is:

A severe censure motion that was never put.

He was ruled out of order three times.

Council has had no representative on the Board for three months.

His concerns were ignored.

He has been requested to resign from a seat he has never held.

Now the Chief Secretary’s Office has written confirming his stand that the Council and not the Local Board of Health must appoint the representative.  A copy of this letter is printed.
