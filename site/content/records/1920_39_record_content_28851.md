The erection of some £50,000 worth of new housing.

The opening of Children’s Playgrounds at Aberdeen & Kooringa.

The great increase of tarred road from a quarter of a mile to several miles.

Mr Treloar seconded the adoption of the report and especially thanked Mrs Collins for her work over the years.

Election speeches of candidates followed.

Cr Riggs outlined his experience as a Councillor for six years.  He thought asphalt and spremax were likely to prove superior to tar and thought a crusher for metal would be needed and would save money in upkeep sufficient to pay for the £45-£300 outlay.  Bridges he felt should come from general funds and not ward funds.  The Council presently had three horses (two past their prime).  He felt the rate would have to stay at 2/6. He favoured each ward getting £300 as this year rather than the 75% of rates collected in it.  As Mayor he would have the whole town’s interests at heart.

Mr Kellaway said he had been a Councillor for eight years and had experience as chair of all committees.  He felt many old trees should be replanted with ornamental ones.  He favoured the use of spremax on roads, but gravel for footpaths.

Mr Morton favoured solid work on roads that would last, but he is not reported on other matters of policy.

Mr Morgan thought too much was spent on roads and side streets needed attention.

Mr Wicklein asked about tarring Market Square.  Mr Kellaway was for it and Mr Morgan would wait to see the finances.  Cr Woollacott said it had been delayed by the monument scheme which was still undecided.  Crs Pearce and Riggs felt that finances were against it.

On the question of unclaimed allotments the Mayor said the cost of getting title was more than the value of the land.

There was a question about a water cart for Fridays especially, but the consensus was against it.
