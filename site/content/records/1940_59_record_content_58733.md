Burra Town Council, 8 April

Permission was granted for the Brooklyn Speedway SA to drop leaflets from an aircraft to publicise a motor racing meeting at Pt Wakefield on 25 April.

W. Kakoschke’s application to use the War Memorial Oval after the football season to train a pacer was refused du to conditions of the existing lease.

H.J. & J.B. Topsfield were granted permission for a new shop front on Pt allotment 70A.

A photograph of H.M. the Queen 20 inches x 16 inches at £6-6-0 is to be purchased.

The Town clerk reported the removal of netting protection around trees at the rear of the Memorial Oval.

Only two graves at a time are to be left open at the cemetery and the matter of filling those open to be left in the hands of the Mayor and Town Clerk [which sounds a bit sinister!]
