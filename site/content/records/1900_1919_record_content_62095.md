Thomas McNamara writes in reply to ‘Hanson’ of 24 September 1919 page 3, concerning the bad behaviour of a returned soldier at Hanson and explaining why behaviour that disadvantaged him was not entirely undeserved.  [He says that the returned soldier in question last harvest when carting materials for his fence passed his own crop and deliberately drove through a crop of wheat just coming out in head, for nearly a quarter of a mile that the writer had in shares with T. James (also a returned soldier).  This thoroughly destroyed a strip of crop and he has also for the last three months been passing through a road the writer was renting from the DC and leaving it open.  With such behaviour he cannot expect better from others.
