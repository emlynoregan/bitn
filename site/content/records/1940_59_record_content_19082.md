Burra’s Centenary

As the first move in the centenary celebrations in 1945 the Mayor has moved to have an honour roll in the Council Chamber to record the Mayors and Town Clerks of Burra.  Council has endorsed the move.

Mr Angus Rogers received a presentation of a chromium ink stand from his staff on his leaving the district after selling his business to Mr Donald P. Kerr.

The Davey family has collectively 88 years as Local Government Clerks; probably an unbeaten record in the country.

William Davey served 30 years as District & Town Clerk.

A.A. Davey served 25 years as Clerk of the Burra District Council.

E.J. Davey served 33 years as Town Clerk for Burra.

(E.J. & A.A. Davey are sons of William Davey.)
