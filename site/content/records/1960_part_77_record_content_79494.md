Corrections to last week’s History of the Burra Record.

E.F. Marston who took over the paper in 1913 did not run a photographic studio.  His predecessor Mr W.J. Davey did.

Mr Davey’s sons Harold and Billy continued to work for the Record until they went elsewhere.

The Record was then printed in premises occupied by Matthews in a section nearest Bence’s.

It was later burnt out.

We have a photo of the premises in 1913 with E.F. Marston, W.J. Davey Jnr and H.J. Davey standing outside with Arnold Gravestocks, another employee.  This has come from Ian Auhl on loan from Mrs Miriam Davey, widow of the late W.J. Davey Jnr.  We hope to publish it next week.  [They didn’t.]
