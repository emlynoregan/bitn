Redruth Gaol

The Burra Town Council has received a grant of $475 from the Government for the preservation of Redruth Gaol.  After a meeting between representatives of the Council and the National Trust it was decided to remove boxthorns and the present fences and then to re-fence the area granted to the Council, to renovate the façade and to give the building a facelift inside and out and to build an access ramp to the property.  The Tourist Bureau believes Burra has sufficient buildings to make it a first class tourist attraction.  Tours to Burra will be the next step to be organised.  The Corporation and the National Trust consider these moves are in the best interests of the town and deserve general support.

Redruth Gaol and Reformatory: Some Historical Notes by Ian Auhl.

The Gaol is important because it was the first to be erected in a country area.  This was because in the 1840s there were no other country towns of any size in SA.  The population of the Mine area rose to 5,000 between 1845 and 1850.  The population of Adelaide at the time was not much more than 20,000.  Redruth Police Station was erected in the late 1840s in the Government Town of Redruth, rather than in the SA Mining Association town of Kooringa.  A temporary gaol was built on the police block with stables for the police mounts and an exercise yard and cells.  This building still stands with a shingle roof, covered now with iron.  The new official gaol was built in 1856 at a cost of c. £3,800.  It included a residence for the Gaoler and two Turnkeys, with a kitchen, wash-house and storeroom.  There were three sells for males and three for females.  The cells were ceiled with four inch gum planks to prevent escapes.  The first Gaoler was Mr T. Perry (his wife was Annie).  (The present Tom and Anne Perry disclaim any relationship.)  The Gaol became known as Perry’s Hotel and this term was even used in the Law Court reports.  Mr Perry was keeper 1856-79 and he and his wife are buried in the Burra Cemetery.  Messrs Pollitt & Young were Gaol Keepers 1880-84 and Mr Criddle took over from 1885 till closure in 1894.  In 1858 Mr Perry complained that the Gaol was overcrowded with ‘prisoners and lunatics’.  Gaol sentences were handed out for offences that now would warrant only a fine and the court was always crowded to hear the details of the more horrible or salacious offences.  Court reports of the day were detailed and left nothing to the imaginations.  Today such reporting would bring action for libel.  When the Gaol closed in 1894 there were suggestions it could be used as an abattoirs and a freezing works.  For a few years it was occupied by the Woollacott family and Mr Stan Woollacott was born in it.  In 1897 it was renovated and became a Girls’ Reformatory.  The girls arrived in December 1897.  There was fist, second and third class accommodation.  The more incorrigible girls were sent from Adelaide.  About 30 girls were house, some as young as 15.  They worked in the garden, laundry, kitchen, rooms and the wood heap.  From time to time there were escapes.  The first matron was Mrs Holden and there was a sib-matron and a wards woman.  The cost was recorded as 17/5⅜ per girl per week.  The place was grim and forbidding as is its story.
