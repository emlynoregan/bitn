Obituary & Inquest.  The inquest was held at the Burra Hospital on 16 May into the death of James Hogan (aged 17) on 15 May, with P. Lane JP as coroner and John Snell as foreman of the jury.

Michael Hogan, father of the deceased described how his wife and he with James were going to Davis’s at Booborowie.  James was riding and his parents were in a cart.  James suddenly developed a pain in his head and he and his father changed places.  After a while James said he felt better, but a bit further on he collapsed and was speechless.  They took him home and sent for the doctor and priest, but he died about half an hour later.

Mrs Hogan gave evidence similar to her husband’s.

Dr J.I. Sangster gave evidence of finding a deceased bone in the skull that had produced an injury to the vessels of the brain and the immediate cause of death was bleeding on the brain surface.

The verdict was death by natural causes.  [Born 7 March 1869]
