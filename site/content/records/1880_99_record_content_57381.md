A Foot Race took place on Saturday afternoon between Tommy Halls and J. Conway on a 100-yard stretch of metalled road between the railway gates and the station.  Conway conceded 10 yards, believing that because Tommy weighs about 17 stone and he only about 9 stone 10 lb he could expect to win.  Tommy got in by a couple of feet and so won the £1 wager.
