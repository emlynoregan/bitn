Mr Lewis stated they admitted blocking up the watercourse if indeed it was considered one, but it had been to protect their own property.  The corporation had commenced the obstruction by raising the creek and had not seen the creek was kept clear.

His Honour said evidence conclusively proved the watercourse existed for nearly 50 years.  The owners of the brewery should be compelled to keep the creek open through their property and the Corporation help Mr Lewis see it was done.

As the case was one of principle only a nominal fine was asked for.  Fine 5/- + costs.
