Gold Fever

It is now useless to shut our eyes to the prospect of a large number of SA labouring men going to the gold-fields of NSW and Victoria, nor should we underestimated the disastrous consequences if at this particular season of the year there are insufficient men to attend to the actual necessities of the colony.  There is no doubt that the first group of men to leave for Melbourne may be of a class we are as willing to be rid of as to retain; the idlers, the dissatisfied, the reckless and the wild.  The prospects of realizing a fortune by digging in the earth for ready made gold will inevitable also overpower the judgement of many an honest labourer.  To try to appeal to prudence and caution will fail when the probabilities of individual success are so magnified.

We can only hope the fever will not be in a particularly malignant form and that the public press, and other forces acting to reduce the fever, will not be entirely ineffective.

The difficulty of abuse of our Emigration Fund will be great indeed.  Parties are very likely to use it to get to SA without any intention of staying here, but of moving on to the east immediately.

The discovery of a workable gold field in SA is very desirable at the moment, because it would reduce the abstraction of labour from our territory, though the immediate impact on other industries would be similar.

[The writer goes on to consider ways of forcing or inducing migrants to stay in SA.

We fear the risks of abuse of the Land Fund cannot be much diminished, but we fear that a suspension of emigrant ships we fear would be an even more serious evil.
