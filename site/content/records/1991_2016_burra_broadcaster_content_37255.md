The 125 km Burra Cycling Classic had to contend with blustery wind and of the 50 starters only 21 completed the course.  Six members of a visiting Chinese National Track team took part and though they had never raced on a road before, Xue Long Qu surprised all by coming 4th.  The eventual winner was Steve Cunningham.

Three races for junior riders were held:

U17 50 km:	won by Sean Boyle, the young rider who last year had a collision with a car at the event.

U15 30 km:	won by Shamus Liptrot.

U13 10 km:	won by Alexandra Parkinson.

Sundayâ€™s events involving laps around a town circuit were run in very wet and wild conditions.
