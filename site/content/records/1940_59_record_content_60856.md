Local Board of Health, 5 October

A report from the Central Board of Health inspector says that the bakehouse of J.H. Waters does not meet structural requirements of the regulations under the Act.

Mr Waters will be interviewed regarding the matter.

The inspector also recommended more frequent removal of rubbish from the town, especially in the summer months.
