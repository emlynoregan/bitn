‘Fairplay’ writes re football.  He questions the results of the Manoora game last Wednesday.  Burra undoubtedly got 3.2 (20).  Manoora got 3.10 (28), but then the field umpire cancelled the last goal making Manoora’s total 2.11 (23).  The second goal went between the posts but was certainly touched by two Burra men, but the field umpire would not agree even after Manoora said it was not a fair goal.  So the ‘real’ result should be Manoora 1.12 (18) to Burra 3.2 (20).  The field umpire was impartial, but made severe errors and should know much more about the game.
