BRTBA held its AGM on 28 August.

The Association decided it was best to have a working party set up to work with Mr Kerrigan to investigate whether BRTBA is the best organisation to take on the role of a CMC and if not to decide on who else would be suitable for the role.  [Rather than the ‘roll’ as printed.]  Sue Ryan was re-elected President.
