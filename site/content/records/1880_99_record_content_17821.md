Letter from ‘A Ratepayer’ about the habit councillors have of making good roads even to their own back doors, while others could not even get a rut filled in at their front doors.  He says in his rambles he ‘noticed a nice new street made at the back of the blacksmith’s shop and leading to no place in particular.  I was puzzled as to its use, but my mate, called me an ass . . . He told me it was a military road, to be used when the Russian cruisers sail up the Burra Creek!’
