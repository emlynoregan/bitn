9 March 1988

Merino Capital of the World

Burra will be proclaimed the Merino Capital of the World at 3 p.m. on Friday 11 March in Market Square by the Minister of Tourism the Hon. Barbara Wiese MLC.  [Picture of logo.]

This has been supported by the Burra Burra DC and South Australian Tourism.  There are ambitious plans to go hand in hand with this exciting venture.

Sign are to be unveiled at the main approaches to the town to the north, south and east.

Car stickers will be available.

The longest running series of Merino Field Days in Australia will follow the event: the first day being Monday 14 March.  Thousands of sheepmen and women from all over Australia make the annual pilgrimage to the district to see the vast cross-section of the Stateâ€™s Stud Merino industry displayed by stud masters.  This concentration of studs in one area, resulting in a minimum of travel for visitors has great appeal.  Of 353 studs in SA, 154 are in the Mid North.  More than half stud sheep produced in SA are produced in the Mid North and Mid North studs account for three quarters of the rams sold.  The number of rams sold represents 33% of the entire Australian Poll Merino Ram sales and 12.5% of Australian Merino ram sales.
