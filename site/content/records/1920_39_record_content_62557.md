Burra Town Council, 3 August

The Main Road grant was £400 to be matched with £100 from the Council.

Mr Edgar Pearce wrote asking the Council’s attitude to the fact that timber for tree guards was sourced from Adelaide with no chance for a local to quote. He also asked why local masons had not been asked to quote for the Soldiers’ Memorial job.

Cr Kellaway said the tree guards had been left to Mr Fairchild to arrange and he understood the latter had local quotes, but saved money by dealing with Adelaide.

The Council’s attitude favoured local business where possible.  The Soldiers’ Memorial work was being carried out by day labour.

It was decided to get a copy of the Civic Centenary Record of SA with the Council’s name engraved on it for £4-4-0 and for it to be lodged at the Library.

Underwriters advise that the power to the memorial must pass through 3 inch earthenware pipes.

Burra Racing Club.  A committee has preparations well in hand for a race meeting on 1 October.  Stakes amounting to £200 will be paid.  This will be the first race meeting for the club for seven years.  The committee comprises: N. Hiles Pearse (Chairman), P.W. Clark, M.W. Bednall, Andrew Tennant, C.V. Opie, H.F. Saunders, W.A. Harfield, G.S. Hawker and E.C. Collins.
