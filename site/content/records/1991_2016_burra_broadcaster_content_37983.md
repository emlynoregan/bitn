Letter.  C. Tiver of Burra writes that she and her brother, Don, met recently with Joan Sutton nee Davies and her two daughters, Kerry & Lindy, when they came to celebrate Joan’s 60th birthday.  This visit sparked memories of Burra during WWII.  Some of the memories that were recalled were:

Joan was one of the aeroplane spotters who operated from an observatory located in a building behind Matthews Emporium, where Décor Made Easy currently stand on Market Square.

[In 1910 the premises of the Burra Record in Market Square, which included a photographic studio, were destroyed by fire.  It took almost three months to return the paper to production in Burra and the photographic studio was also replaced as reported in the first issue of the paper after the fire: 13 July 1910, page 2 -

The photographic studio is now being rebuilt two storeys high* to become one of the largest and best lit studios anywhere.  [*But note that the report in the paper of 17 Aug. 1910, page 3 describes a three storey building, which photographs would seem to verify.

This building later fell into disuse and was available for the aeroplane spotters.

The Burra Record of 19 Dec. 1950, page 1 reported another fire:

Part of the back premises of Matthew’s Emporium burnt down during lunch hour yesterday.  Mostly the fire was confined to the two storey wood and iron building once used as a photographic studio.  The high narrow structure acted like a chimney.  Ray Bevan raised the alarm and volunteers did well salvaging lino, furniture and men’s clothing from fire and water damage.]

Miss Essie Brice was another of the spotters, who manned the observatory 24 hours a day in shifts.

There were many memories of musical performances of the period and of Joan’s participation in tap dancing acts under the leadership of Mrs Rae Corry.

Joan’s father, Viv Davies, ran the Burra Bacon Factory, located where McPhee’s butcher shop now operates.  [2 Market Street.]

An ice works was already there in operation when her father bought the business and they continued to make ice and send it to customers by train, wrapped in hessian and packed in sawdust to preserve it.

The pigs were slaughtered at ‘Cactus Farm’ [Section 1 Block 17 at the southern entrance to the town], where Sid Johnson and his family lived.

Ted Motheral and a Mr Spackman worked for Joan’s father, as did Joan and her husband, Ian Sutton.
