New Oddfellows Lodge Hall.

At Aberdeen on Wednesday Bro. August Bartholomaeus opened the new hall for the Loyal Aberdeen Lodge MUIOOF.  PG Bro. C. Fuss was in the chair.  Bro. Bartholomaeus was the oldest member in Burra and could look back 53 years to the opening of the Lodge in Burra.  The Lodge first met at the old Burra hotel, now the Hospital.  The Aberdeen Lodge was opened in 1858 and it met at the old Aberdeen Hotel and had upwards of 90 members in its first year, but after a while they moved to the old [German] schoolroom near the Court House in Redruth and met there for 38 years until it was destroyed by fire in 1910.  Some 487 members had passed through the lodge and over £6,700 had been distributed in sick-pay plus doctors’ money and funeral fees etc.  They had at present 137 members.  Various speeches followed.  The hall cost upward of £200.
