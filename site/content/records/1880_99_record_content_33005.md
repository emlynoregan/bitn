World’s End Church.  The opening services of the new building were interfered with last month by the heavy rain and were therefore continued on 30 June when Dr J.R. Stephens of Mongolata preached two sermons.  The tea meeting on Wednesday was largely attended.  John Lane took the chair and described how services began some years ago in the neighbourhood.  The expenditure had been about £100, exclusive of some gifts and a large amount of free labour and cash receipts had totalled about £80.

At the meeting Rev. H.T. Burgess undertook to get £6 if the congregation raised the balance there and then.  Subscriptions came in till the amount was raised and the church was free of debt.
