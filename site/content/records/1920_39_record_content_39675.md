Mongolata Goldfield

A parcel of 4 tons 12cwt from Flaherty, Bevan & Morgan’s mine returned 27 oz or almost 6 oz to the ton after battery and cyanide treatment.  The gold in the tailings was exceedingly fine.  The battery gold was worth £3-17-9 an oz and the cyanide treated tailings £4 per oz.  The tailings showed no free or visible gold.

Report of Mr Gepp & Dr Ward.  They concluded:

As the field was discovered only 10 months ago it is in an early stage of development, but the lode has been exposed at many points.

Lodes consist of quartz associated with limonite.  The richer portions are associated with the ironstone.  On the whole the vein stuff is sharply defined.

Lode structure is complex in a branching system of fissures and width is variable.  The system may be yards wide, though individual veins are small.  The system is of mostly complicated fractures.

The stoping of ore will produce workings of irregular outline.

So far little systematic work has been carried out and attention has focused on places marked by quartzose outcrops.

Very little loaming has been carried out systematically on the lower slopes of the steep eastern front.  Shoots of auriferous lode matter could be found at places between the more prominent quartzose outcrops.  [Loaming means washing the base of a hill to discover gold traces and so track back via the increasing number of grains to the lode.]

All work so far is above the water table, so as yet it is impossible to say whether any material secondary enrichment has taken place.

The cost of sending ore to the Petersburg battery is equal to about 6-7dwt gold and therefore only comparatively high grade ore is viable.

The lineal extent of country carrying good veins is known to be about 5 miles.

We believe the field justifies a light modern battery, even if it is found necessary for stacking of the tailings for later cyanide treatment when tonnage justifies it.  70% of the gold is recoverable by amalgamation only and 30% is in the tailings.

A suitable battery with building and accessory equipment could be erected for £500 to £1,000.

The Department of Mines has suggested the possibility of a portable battery, but the low cost of treatment will be influenced by keeping it running 24 hours a day six days a week.

One permanent supervisor would suffice if the suppliers of ore agree to supply the labour for the treatment and clean-up.

A good site in proximity to a bore is available nearby.

We believe the development of the field will be better fostered by a public battery rather than by subsidies to individual properties.

Some provision should be made for a water supply for the field without delay.

An increased ration for men who undertake hard physical work in an endeavour to become self supporting and who cannot at the present time supplement their ration from any source whatever should be granted.

The development of this goldfield should be continued.
