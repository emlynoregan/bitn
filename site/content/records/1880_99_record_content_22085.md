The SA Depression.  The Sydney Morning Herald reported on the depression in SA, saying that the reports reaching Sydney were much exaggerated, though the truth was serious enough.  The volume of trade has decreased by one fourth and real estate has decreased in value.  There are hundreds of unemployed and there is an outflow of population that greatly exceeds the inflow.  Bur it is nothing like as bad as in parts of Britain, with no signs of poverty in the streets, like shoeless children etc.  It has been coming for five years with a coincidence of failing wheat crops, low prices for wool and copper, and land speculation.  The failure of the wheat crop in newly settled areas has caused a collapse in Adelaide land values where speculation was rife.
