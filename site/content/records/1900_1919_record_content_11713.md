Obituary.  Rowland Rees, a former very active politician, died on Thursday aged 64.  He and W.B. Rounsevell sat for Burra in 1881.  Some years ago he went to WA, but had returned to Adelaide when he died.  [Somewhat more might have been expected by way of an obituary given that not only had he been a long serving local member of Parliament, but had been the architect for several notable buildings in the town.  He was born in 1840 and arrived in SA in 1869 on the Duke of Sutherland.  For Burra he designed Roachâ€™s Flour Mill in 1874 and in the same year the rebuilt Institute and the Redruth Wesleyan (later Methodist) Church.  He designed the Royal Exchange Hotel in 1880 for Aberdeen and was also responsible for the Koonoona Woolshed.  The registration says died 13 October 1904 aged 62.]
