Redbanks.  Recent discoveries have confirmed earlier hints that marsupial lions roamed the area in the last ice age.  Small fossil remnants had suggested this about six years ago.  Now a pelvis and arm bone of the Thylacoleo have been found near Diprotodon fossils.  It is believed to have been about the size of a large wolf or leopard and was Australiaâ€™s largest marsupial predator.  Thylacoleo carnifex had huge meat-slicing cheek teeth and retractable clawed opposable thumbs.  The Redbanks site is important as finds are near the surface and more intact than at other sites.
