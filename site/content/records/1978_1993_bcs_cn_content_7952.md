Fred Atkin Memorial Fund

Fred served the Methodist and then the Uniting Church faithfully all his life.  This fund has been set up in his name to raise money to upgrade the Burra Uniting Church and Sunday School.  So far $2,500 has been forthcoming and $1,810 has been spent repairing the church roof and the third phase wiring of the Sunday School has been completed for $528.  The Sunday School roof is in dire need of attention.
