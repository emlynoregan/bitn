Burra Hospital

Last Friday afternoon the Hon. Sir Lyell McEwin opened the new building at the Burra Hospital.  The Vice-Chairman of the Hospital Board Mr Eric Ashby introduced the Mayor E.T. Baulderstone, who extended a welcome to Sir Lyell.  The Mayor said that Burra had played an important part in the economy of SA for almost 120 years, first through the days of the copper mine and later with the sheep industry.  The Mayor also welcomed Mr G. Gilfillan, Matron Croeser and two Hospital Inspectors, Messrs O’Donnell & Kelly.  He also welcomed the presence of Miss Siegele who took up duties at the Hospital in 1924 and was appointed Matron six months later.  She held the position for ten years.  Mrs Peak and the Misses G. & E. Williams were representatives of pioneer families.  Mrs Peal and Miss Gertrude Williams were daughters of Mrs E.C. Williams nee Kathryn Watson, the first fully trained nurse at the Hospital, who came from England in 1876.  Other Hospitals were also represented at the opening.

Mr Ron Pearse spoke as Chairman of the Hospital Board.  He said Sir Lyell had been the obvious choice to open the building, not just because he was Chief Secretary and Minister of Health, but also because he had taken a personal interest in the Hospital.

Sir Lyell recalled earlier visits as the work was in progress and visits too when Dr Steele was in the town and the hospital faced drainage problems and all sorts of embarrassments. Out of these troubles had emerged the most attractive development seen today.  Burra was one of about three places which had started a hospital before any assistance was available from Government.  [He went on to recount how Government had moved from a pound for pound subsidy to a two pound for one pound subsidy and that subsidies now also covered furnishings and other items, which had only gained such recognition in recent years.]

Sir Lyell went on to praise the development plan for the Hospital and of course the Government policies supporting hospitals generally and their equipment.  He had words of praise for the contractor Mr Mass and the architect Messrs Stapledon [sic] & Michael.  He also had praise for the staff and the Women’s auxiliary and the Board of Management.

Mr Glen Finch moved a vote of thanks to Sit Lyell, which was seconded by Dr L.G. Miller.

Mr Pearse then handed Mrs John Gebhardt and Mrs Andrew Tennant Honorary Life Membership Certificates.
