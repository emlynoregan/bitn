Burra & District Swimming Pool

Only seven persons attended a public meeting to discuss the future management of the pool and this included the Mayor and two Councillors.  The others were two members of the Swimming Club and one newcomer to the town.  Discussion disclosed the view that the control of the pool by the Burra & District Swimming Club resulted in the needs of the competitive swimmer being placed before the needs of the public and casual swimmers.  A resolution was passed that a recommendation be made at the Swimming Clubâ€™s AGM that the management and control of the pool be vested with the Corporation and the Club concentrate on running competitive swimming.
