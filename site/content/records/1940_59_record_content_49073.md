Burra Town Hall Pictures

In 1949 Stan Woollacott, Councillor for North Ward, recommended the Council take over the moving picture rights for the community, when the lease expired in September 1950.  Cr Jennison introduced the discussion in July 1950 and reported on the experience of Pt Elliott in showing pictures.  Information was then sought from Pt Elliott, Pt Wakefield, Snowtown, Balaklava and Terowie.  Applications from several operators were also considered.  A visit was made to Pt Elliott and useful information also came from Terowie, Balaklava and Kimba.  The Council then sought tenders for projection and sound equipment and sought ratepayer approval to borrow Â£1,700 for its purchase.  When there was no objection to this, Cr Jennison moved that the Council take over the showing of films to liquidate the Town Hall debt and generate money for improvements, after paying off the equipment.  A committee was formed to run this community project.  The Chairman was the Mayor and the Town Clerk was Secretary.  Others were the Councillors with H.C. Davies and Rev. R. Pettet as Institute representatives.  Messrs Jennison & Davies became the picture buyers; Walter Nankivell was appointed Bio-operator with D. Halliday as Hall Manager, S. Scroop Assistant Hall Manager, and A. Brown and S. Kellaway Jnr as Door Stewards.  The pictures will operate from next Saturday, 10 February, when 40 guests, including G.S. Hawker MP and his wife, will see the project started.
