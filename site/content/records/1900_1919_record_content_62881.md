He commented on Cr McBride’s wish for a higher assessment and pointed out that when his assessments rose he had twice appealed against them – this year being the only person to do so.  No one who knew the Town Clerk would accuse him of dealing unfairly.  He thought electric light the only way out of the lighting problem.

Mr Kellaway thought the workers deserved a shilling a day more.

Mr Ewins said he was ignorant of municipal affairs, but would do his best in his new position.

There was then considerable interchange between Mr Winnall and the Councillors elect and Councillors on the increase in his rates.

All were in favour of tar-paving and keeping up and extending gardens.

Mr Davey defended the assessment and said other assessments had been raised.  Farmers’ Union had gone from £50 to £200.  He could have raised Mr McBride’s vacant land by 5%, but had only increased it 3½%.  There was no appeal except by Mr McBride who perplexingly now said his were not high enough.

All were in favour of tenders for leasing park lands.
