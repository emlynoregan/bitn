Burra & District War Memorial Committee celebrated its 10th birthday and reported steady if unspectacular progress.  This year the girls’ basketball court will be completed and it is hoped to provide some extra seating around the oval.  The committee this year took over afternoon teas and raised £75 for committee funds.  The AGM will held in the Council Chambers on Monday 23 September at 8 p.m.
