Mr Robins was bringing a load of wood out to Copperhouse on 24 February when the breech strap broke at the Aberdeen crossing and the load ran onto the horse which plunged and broke the shafts.  Both occupants were thrown to the ground and the son was badly bruised and received severe abrasions.  The horse made for home and was cut under her forelegs through the saddle slipping round.
