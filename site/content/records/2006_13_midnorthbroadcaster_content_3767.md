SAMDBNRM Board & the Bureau of Rural Sciences have initiated a Community Stream Sampling Project.  The Burra to Truro sub-region is one of four in the exercise.  Volunteers have done accredited training to ensure the integrity of data.  The surface water kits provided test salinity, nitrates, phosphates pH and turbidity, while the ground water kits test salinity and depth from ground level to water.  The Burra Community has shown enthusiasm for this project and data is starting to flow in.  [Photo of NRM Boardâ€™s project officer Caren Martin with volunteers Ally Fricker and Bob Lamb.]
