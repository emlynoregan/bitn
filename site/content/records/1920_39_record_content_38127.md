Rev. Father Morrissey has been appointed resident priest at St Joseph’s and took up his duties last Sunday.

Mr R.H. Bruce Sen. of Kooringa aged 89 went to Broken Hill for a holiday last Wednesday.

Weather.  Rain has fallen in the last week with some useful falls to the east of between 20 & 40 points.

Football.  At Burra on Saturday: Burra 11 defeated Eudunda 2.

The visitors were then entertained at the Royal Exchange Hotel by the Aberdeen Football Club and most went to a dance at Leighton, while some went to the local pictures.

Rev. G.C. Hutchinson visited Redruth & Kooringa Methodist Churches last week in the interests of Home Missions and showed the moving picture The Great North West.  Among the many interesting views were some of Wilgena Station with its great water scheme, the property of A.J. & P.A. McBride.

H. Raymond writes urging support for the concerts at Mt Bryan & Hallett on 5 & 6 May in aid of the Institution for the Blind which is struggling desperately in these hard times.
