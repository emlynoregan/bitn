Capt. J.A. Watt was in Burra on Thursday on his way to Quorn, where he has had the Grand Junction Hotel, but is relinquishing it on account of bad health.  He was in drapery some years ago in Kooringa and later went south in the same line.  Later still he was a commercial traveller for a large spirit firm in the city.  His heart has been giving him trouble for some time and though now rather better, he has been ordered a quiet and worry-free life.  While in Burra he ran the old Burra Volunteers and later the Mounted Infantry.  He served in the South African War, being mentioned several times for bravery.  He has lost four of his family recently by death.
