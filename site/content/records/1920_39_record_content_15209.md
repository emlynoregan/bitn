Burra Hospital Board, meeting of 23 February

The Board is still in dispute with the Government over funding.  The Inspector-General asks if the area asking to be excised from the Burra Hospital District and attached to the Eudunda Hospital was served by Burra.  He is to be advised that it is and that other areas like North Booborowie attached to other hospitals are also served by Burra.

Charge-nurse Seagle is acting-matron.
