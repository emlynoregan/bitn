The Smelting Co. in 1860 paid 20/- a ton for the supply of 600-800 tons per week.  Wood was obtained under licence. (Costing Â£5 for 12 months on Crown Land.)  Woollacott for instance sought a protection order for 8 squ. miles near Ulooloo Creek.  Wood had to be weighed and it was not unusual to see teams lined up 50 deep north and south of the Mine Bridge waiting their turn.  In 1860 wood licences were sought by Josiah Thomas, James Thomas, Luke Teddy, William Holmes & Henry Collins, of whom only Henry Collins of Mt Bryan survives today.  [He died 18 October 1929]

[Treloar then goes on to give prices for fodder from 1857 to 1860.]
