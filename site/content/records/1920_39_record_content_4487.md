The deputation from the Burra Ambulance Committee met the Council.  Mr Lane said that 12 months ago Dr Steele had suggested the necessity for a motor ambulance.  The idea was taken up and an ambulance was bought and a garage built for c. £360.  There was £10 in hand and a few bills outstanding. The deputation asked the Council to take over the ambulance.  Dr Steele thought that about half the annual cost would come from hire and the rest could be raised by an annual appeal.
