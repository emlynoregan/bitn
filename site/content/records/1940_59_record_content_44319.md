Redruth Methodist Sunday School celebrated the 25th anniversary of the opening of the Memorial Hall on 7 & 8 February 1925.

7 February 1925 Mr James Reed opened the Hall and Mrs W.H. Gare unveiled a Memorial Tablet.  Revs W.J. Mortimer & F.L. Rooney gave addresses.  The orchestra was conducted by G.E. Dane with soloist Miss Elsie Woolley.  A Public Tea and a Children’s Tea followed in Jubilee Hall.   In the evening there was a concert featuring soloists, the orchestra and the Aber-Koorie Christie Minstrels.

8 February 1925 there was a service by Rev. Mortimer and at 2.30 p.m. Mr Dunhill directed a farewell service at Jubilee Hall followed by a procession and opening service at the new hall.  Rev. Mortimer conducted the evening service.  The resident minister was Rev. Harry Alvery. [Sic: error for Harry Alvey.]

The ambition had been to open the hall free of debt.  Money came in slowly until a gift of £1,000 from Mr James Reed.  Money then came in more quickly as the opening drew near and at the end Mr James Reed said he would make up any deficiency.  The cost was £4,400.  The building was constructed by Messrs T.H. Woollacott & F.M. Pearce supervised by the architect J.H. Laity.

Now the staff is adequate, but the group of school students pathetically small.  Why is it so?  Centralisation has taken families to the city.  Perhaps teaching methods have not kept pace with the changes.  Or is it in this age we don’t need Christ?  These and other questions need to be answered if we are to preserve the Christian way of life.
