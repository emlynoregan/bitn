The Hindmarsh Salvation Army Band with Corps Commander Major H. England arrived on Saturday evening.  They gave a short open-air meeting in Market Square.  On Sunday at 9.15 a.m. a Knee Drill Service was conducted at the Citadel by Major England before the band marched to the hospital for a concert for patients.  At 11 a.m. there was a Holiness Meeting and there was a very large congregation for the evening meeting and an after-church meeting at the Town Hall.  The Band also performed at the Anzac Service at the invitation of the RSL.
