Election Matters.  A.D. McDonald writes explaining and defending the Liberal Union’s decision not to condone the actions of its former members in taking it upon themselves to stand for election and in putting up its own properly selected candidates.  He regrets that this has resulted in a three way contest, but insists an important principle is at stake.
