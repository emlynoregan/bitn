At the Reminiscent Meeting Mr Scott said he first came to Ironmine in late 1871 or early 1872, but was not at the first anniversary.  He said Mr T. Hutchins was the first Superintendent followed by Mr Bowen, Walter Fairchild and himself.  W. Fairchild said he first went to the Sunday school 57 years before.  George Goodridge looked back over 35 years and was a proud grandson of the late T. Hutchins, first Superintendent.  Over Â£18 was collected as a result of the jubilee services.
