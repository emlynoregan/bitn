Sgt Burt Broad was in the sea 21 hours before being rescued.

The plane in which Burt was travelling crashed into the sea 150 miles from Pt Moresby.  He and his companions were in the sea for 21 hours before rescue by a RAAF Crash Boat.  They were wind-burnt by day and frozen at night.  Sgt Broad has been in the army for 12 years, joining the AIF on the outbreak of war.  He and 27 others left Pt Moresby on 20 March for Home Leave.  The plane developed trouble in one engine and the pilot turned back, while the co-pilot threw out all possible gear to lighten the load.  After fifteen minutes the second engine cut out and the plane descended rapidly.  The pilot skilfully belly-landed the plane on the water at about 90 miles per hour.  There was no panic, but the passengers slid along the form on which they had been sitting and broke through the partition into the pilotâ€™s compartment.  Fortunately they did not end up in a tangled mess and everyone was able to walk out the back door and into the sea before the plane sank four minutes later.
