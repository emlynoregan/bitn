Burra Burra Mine

The Directors have issued their half-yearly report to shareholders.

In the past six months over 2,000 tons of ore have been obtained, an increase of 200 tons on the previous six months.  This is from open surface working and dressing the orey-slime in the creek and is estimated to contain 17% copper.  Also at the end of March last there was c. 834 tons on hand for a total of 2,836 tons.

2012 tons of this has been delivered to the English & Australian Copper Co., leaving 824 tons at the Mine.  Copper dealt with in the past six months has been 333 tons, of which 183 tons was the balance on 31 March and nearly 150 tons received from the English & Australian Copper Co.  Close to 212 tons of copper were sold in the colony, leaving of hand c. 121 tons.

The balance sheet deals with transactions for two years; 30 September 1866 to 30 September 1868.  Among the credits is a sum of £88,299 paid for wages, plant, stores, etc. and another of £6,963 as expenses of establishments, officers’ salaries etc. and another of £34,535 for Karkulto Mine, buildings, workings etc.

Graves’ Enginehouse has been erected and the shaft sunk to 50 fathoms and a level has been extended to the south, which can be united with Roach’s 50 fathom level by a few more feet of driving.

A prominent place in the report is given to Mr Darlington’s Report.  In accordance with this the present method of raising and dressing ore is to be discontinued.  Cupreous ground and lode stuff from the surface to the 30 fathom level or deeper if practicable is to be open-worked before any further progress is made on the lowest level operations.  The object is to utilise all the pillars and blocks between galleries and stopes, which are believed to contain thousands of tons of ore that is accessible without the heavy costs involved in deep sinking.  The new workings will employ machinery that will dispose of hundreds of tons of lode stuff daily and will concentrate ores intermixed with clay and stone and size the ore so as to render valuable stuff hitherto worthless.

At the same time a dressing floor to deal with the orey sand in the creek will be constructed.  The expense to carry out these recommendations is estimated at £25,000, an amount which can be raised from unrealised produce now on hand.  Mr Darlington has been instructed to obtain from England all the necessary machinery and appliances and it is anticipated that in 18 to 20 months the new process will be ready to start.  By that time it is probable the railway will have reached Burra and it is hoped the copper market will have improved.  Mr Darlington is of the view that the Directors were correct in putting a stop to workings there.
