Burra Show Society committee meeting last Friday to decide whether to hold the show in view of both the drought and the war.  John Melrose (by letter), T. McWaters, F. Duldig, J.E.H. Winnall and A.G. Gebhardt were for postponing on both economic and patriotic grounds.  A.D. McDonald thought it might still be re-organised as a Patriotic Fund event.  Winnall thought it would be a financial loss.  I.J. Warnes then came in and took over the chair from Thomas Sandland, apologising for being late.  He thought the catalogue should have been printed and he supported the show being run on patriotic lines.  This got support from Mr Bailey and F.G, Scholz.  J.Q. Hogan opposed it – he had never seen the country worse than at present.  A.G. Gebhardt agreed with that: at least for the country around Burra.  Thomas McWaters moved the show be postponed.  F. Duldig 2nd.  A.D. McDonald amended that certificates be awarded instead of prizes, no Government subsidy be applied for, and proceeds go to the Patriotic Fund.  A.E. McWaters 2nd.  The amendment was lost and the motion carried.  £10 to be donated to the Patriotic Fund.
