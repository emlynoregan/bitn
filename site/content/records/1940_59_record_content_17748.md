Obituary.  John Henry Honan died in Burra Hospital 5 May aged 86.  He was born on the ship Utopia when his parents were coming from England to Australia in 1858.  The family lived at Burra and then at Mt Bryan where Mr Honan later began farming.  Before the railway went to Broken Hill he carted goods from Burra to Broken Hill with horse teams and carted the first boiler to the mines there.  In 1882 he married a daughter of the late Mr & Mrs James Prior at Mt Bryan East.  Some 38 years ago he went with his family to reside at Hallett and for c. 30 years was overseer of works for the Hallett Council.  He was for a long period the Hallett correspondent for the Burra Record.  He leaves a widow, seven daughters, two sons, two brothers, 26 grandchildren and 15 great-grandchildren.  Two grandsons have fallen in the present war.
