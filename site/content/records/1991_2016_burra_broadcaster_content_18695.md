Goyder Council has called a public meeting for 28 April at 8 p.m. at Burra Town Hall to discuss the future of the hall.  Council has been unable to establish a community committee to manage the hall for several years.  During that time significant sums have been spent on improvements.  Questions to be considered:

How much more should be spent on improvements when other facilities are available in Burra?

Routine maintenance exceeds income, so how can usage and hire be increased to cover maintenance costs?

Is there a group interested in managing the building?

Is the community interested in the future use of the hall?
