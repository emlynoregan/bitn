The meeting resolved to authorise the Board to call a meeting to form a Women’s Hospital Auxiliary.

It was also recommended to the Board that it be reduced in size by having each of the bodies represented by one instead of two persons and also that the number of positions declared vacant each year be increased from 3 to 6.  It was also suggested the Board organise a wood day each year to reduce the cost of this item considerably.
