Obituary.  Matty Phillips, a long-time resident of the district, died last week.  [Notes from a CWA meeting published in the issue of 4 April reveal this was Mrs A.I. Phillips, known as Matty, from which we can say she was born Agnes Isobel Martha Lihou at Kooringa on 28 January 1906 and married Ernest Theodore Phillips in 1932.]
