Burra Swimming Pool

The excavation is now well under way, though it has been slowed by inclement weather.  The machinery was operated by Basil Taylor with experienced overseer Burton.  Various money-raising events are planned over the coming months and among them is a series of bridge evenings at the school.  Dances will be held and there will be an amateur Hour on 21 September, a Queen of the Swimming Pool Competition and a Miss Burra Ball.
