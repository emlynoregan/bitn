Editorial on the Role of Council.  With the really big works now done there will be a claim for maintenance of them and gradual extension of the kerbing, metalling and foot pathing.  The cemetery road must be done.

A Medical Officer must be appointed as required by the Central Board of Health.  The job will be thankless, as anyone reported or investigated will feel aggrieved.  A Â£20 fee could be squeezed from the present rate, but more would require an increased rate.  We cannot allow the Central Board to step in and make a costly appointment.
