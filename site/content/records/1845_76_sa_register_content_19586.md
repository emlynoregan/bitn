Kooringa News, 6 August

Recent reports of bank failures in England and Queensland seem to have led to a panic among locals at Burra on Saturday when they concluded that the National Bank in Kooringa was ‘broke’.  This spread like wildfire and the bank authorities in Adelaide responded by sending a special escort from Adelaide on Saturday afternoon with enough gold bullion to cover all the deposits at the Burra branch.  Last evening, Sunday 5 August our late respected manager Mr Wilkinson arrived with the necessary funds, having stated by telegram that the bank would open at 6 a.m. on Monday morning, prepared to pay all depositors their claims in bullion.  When the bank opened this morning there were no customers.  It was then closed and when it reopened at the usual time a few people took advantage of the offer to obtain gold for their deposits, but no unusual claims were made and the panic subsided.
