Burra Rangeland Action Group (BRAG) held its AGM last week.  Twenty-six landowners and pastoralists attended.  Mr John Oates was re-elected chairperson, a position he has held since the groupâ€™s formation in 2003.  Mr Oates said the group was very proactive in controlling pest plants and feral animals.  Some 22 properties are now involved from the Hundreds of Wonna, Mt Bryan East, Tomkinson, Rees, Mongolata and Baldina. They are particularly concerned with the control of African Boxthorn, feral goats, cats and foxes and of course rabbits.  The group is now ready to move into the next phase of biodiversity and water management.
