Burra Post Office has been sold by Australia Post, but customers will notice little change.  The present postmaster Mr Brian Hastelow has taken the option to purchase the premises and operate the post office under licence from 1 July.  He has been the postmaster here for six years.  The post office was built in the early 1960s.  The Area Manager Gerry Pollard said about 70% of post offices in Australia operate under the owner operator system.
