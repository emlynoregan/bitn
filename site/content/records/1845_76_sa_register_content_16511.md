Black Springs News, 2 April

The bridge over the creek where Mr Waite was swept to his death has been repaired.

A new schoolhouse in connection with the licensed public school in the course of erection in the central part of this locality will be completed in a few days.  This building will be much more eligible for school and other purposes than the dilapidated building lately used.

Divine worship has been instituted here and appeals are being made to erect a suitable place of worship.

Reports also speak of an attempt to re-open one of the abandoned mines in this locality, which would give an impetus to trade and an increase of population.
