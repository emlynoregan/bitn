Burra Town Council, 15 July

The Mayor’s allowance for the year was set at £100 and the usual committees were established.

Dr L.G. Miller was appointed Medical Officer of Health to the Local Board of Health for £25 p.a.

Subdivision of Allotment 61 of Section 1 was approved.

The portion of Kangaroo Street required by J.G. Carpenter will be sold to him for £10.

A notice advising the Council’s intention to level and reclaim a portion of Burra Cemetery containing allotments 542-699, 704-753 and 758 to 1,271 is to be inserted into the Burra Record for three consecutive weeks and in the Advertiser for three consecutive Fridays.

Burra Jubilee Benevolent Society held its AGM 16 July in the Mayor’s Parlour.  Elected: President, Rev. Drought; Secretary, Mrs H. Jennison and Treasurer, Mr F. Atkin.

In the year the sewing machine was repaired and lent to a family who will make good use of it.  A good second hand stove was supplied to one home and a holiday was funded for a young mother who much needed it.
