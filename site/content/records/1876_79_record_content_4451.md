The Loan Meeting is reported at length. Some 200 ratepayers attended. 
Cr Wilkinson said the income of the Corporation was £600 rates, + £200. Once they got rid of the overdraft they would in future have £500 to spend on public works and £300 for current expenses. This year they had to pay an old debt of £300 and had £200 in hand. This, with working expenses, accounted for the whole £800. The extraordinary expenditure of the new bridge had to be provided for in an extraordinary way, either by borrowing, or a special rate. He thought ratepayers would prefer borrowing. If this was refused they would have to take the £200 in hand to pay for the bridge along with £200 from next year. Only the year after next would they be able to spend the full £500 on town improvements. This and the two following years they would spend £800 and with Govt. subsidy, £1,600, less the £550 
for police, leaving £1040.

With the loan they could spend at once £200 with £500 more each other year, totalling £1,200 or with Govt. subsidy a total of £2,400, less the £550 for police, making £1,840, or £840 more than they could without the loan. The town desperately needs roads and footpaths to benefit workingmen and storekeepers. Before long it was expected the Govt. would abolish the grant-in-aid and therefore they should get what they could now. The plan was to borrow £400 and begin to repay after three years, paying off £100 in each year thereafter to eliminate the debt in seven years. The interest would amount to £176 leaving a clear gain to the town of £224, besides the immediate benefit from the roads, paths etc.

Cr Roberts 2nd.  Mr A. Harris spoke against the loan and moved no loan be allowed as an amendment. Mr Tiver 2nd — along with Harris he thought it was to mortgage all our property. Mr Geake spoke against the amendment — the ratepayers’ burden would not be increased by the loan and no extra rate was proposed. He felt the approaches had to be paid for and personally thought a 6d special rate the best way, but if not that then the loan. Otherwise there would be no public work carried out till 1880. It was no use crying that the council did nothing if it was given no money to work with. Mr Cave asked if the Govt. would not supplement the money spent to purchase the approach to the new bridge. They would not, said the Mayor. Mr Dawson opposed the loan. Mr Cave questioned whether the Govt. wouldn’t support a new road purchase. Mr Lane said the surveyor had asked the Corporation to try to get the approaches opened through Messrs Statton & Henderson’s yard and they had done so. Cr Roberts supported the Loan as being the best way of maximising the Govt. subsidy while it was still available.
