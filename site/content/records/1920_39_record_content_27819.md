Obituary.  John Wise died quite suddenly on 11 August.  His wife died in March 1928.

He was born at Gumeracha 9 June 1846 to parents who had arrived in SA in 1836.  He was connected to the Baptist Church at Kenton Valley, but when 21 took up land at Hallett where he joined the Bible Christians.  On 2 May 1871 he married Susanna Margaret White of Gumeracha at Kooringa Methodist Church.  They had 16 children and there are 62 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.  Their home at Hallett became the residence for pioneering ministers and John Wise was a local preacher there for many years as well as Sunday school Superintendent, circuit steward and Conference representative.  Some years later the family moved to Burra where he served the Kooringa Circuit.  15 years ago he retired to Prospect and was there associated with the Prospect North Church.
