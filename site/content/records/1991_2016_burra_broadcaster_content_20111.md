Burra Clare Snowtown Health Service Review

The Wakefield Regional Executive Group has decided to review health unit amalgamations to evaluate what has worked and what disadvantages there may have been.  The Burra Burra Hospital was amalgamated with the Clare District Hospital, Snowtown Soldiers’ Memorial Hospital, Lower North Community Health Service and Kara House to form the Burra Clare Snowtown Health Service.  The outcomes will inform future decision making regarding health service management structures in the Wakefield Region.  Health Outcomes International has been engaged to assist in the review.
