Editorial on the Burra-Silverton Railway in which the editor disputes the distances cited by the Commissioner and contending that a broad gauge line would only be £170 per mile dearer, not the £500 a mile cited by the Commissioner.  Water facilities on the Burra line would be much better.  In several seasons in the past water trains have had to serve Terowie from Burra and Petersburg from Yongala.  The reason teams go from Terowie is that the cost of 40 miles by rail is worth saving 15 miles of team carriage.  Despite this many teams still do go from Burra.
