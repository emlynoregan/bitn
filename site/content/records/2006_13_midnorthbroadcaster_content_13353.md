Phoenix Copper managing director Peter Dowd said he did not understand the decision, but that the company was committed to exploration outside the reserve in the Burra North prospect.  He would be contacting the Minister for further clarification as there were issues that were contradictory to what has been the case previously.  The company would not be taking their bat and ball and going home.
