The Burra Railway

A petition seeking the return of passenger train services to Burra and the Mid North will soon be tabled in the SA Parliament.  It carries over 1,000 signatures.  Burra Motor Inn proprietors Paul Henley and Robert Frischke initiated the move.  Even people who are pessimistic about the move think it would be a good idea.  The petition has been circulated widely through the region.  The reopening of the rail system would also have the potential to get some heavy vehicles off the roads.  Many believe that rail is critical in getting more industry to establish itself in the region and thus to provide employment.
