Burra RSL held its AGM on 16 February.  Elected were: President, C.M. Beckwith; Vice-Presidents, J. Battye & E. Peitsch and Secretary, R.W. Nankivell.  Mr Beckwith delivered the annual report.

On March 10 Burra hosted the Mid-North Conference, which was very educational and ended with a very successful dinner.  On 29 September officers from headquarters gave a series of talks on League matters.  The Anzac Day service was again conducted by the Ministers’ Fraternal and the Marananga Band attended and led the march.  Remembrance Day on 11 November was also observed at the Memorial and with addresses at the school.  The annual Ball was an outstanding success and the Annual Smoke Social also drew a full house.  The Christmas Party was combined with the Air Force Association and was a great success.  We thank helpers and purchasers for the success of badge days for Legacy, Poppy Day Appeal and Anzac Day Appeal.  The branch continues to support two Legacy Wards and special thanks are due to the Mt Bryan Legacy Committee.  Two cricket matches were played in the year with Farrell Flat and Booborowie Sub-Branches and two ladies’ evenings were held.  In the year the Club Rooms and Hall have been redecorated and special thanks go to Jim Kelly for this.  Various improvements to fittings were made and the verandah roof is being renewed by working bees.  Lisle Pearce has repaired Honour Rolls and Tables.  Mr V.A. Riggs has over 100 trees ready for planting next year.  Part of the area of Servicemen’s Avenue has been lost due to circumstances beyond our control and we are seeking an alternative site for further planting.

Mr Arthur Bence and Mr Tom Fuller were created life members during the year.  The Sub-Branch gave support to the Flood Relief Appeal on the Murray by financial assistance and the donation of 3,500 bags etc.  The constitution was revised.  Membership this year increased by 20 members to 128 financial members.  In the year we farewelled Mr Don Higginson, Lindsay Halliday and Spen Verrall.  Thanks are extended to all who assisted at functions and especially to the committee and the Ladies’ auxiliary.
