2nd Leader on Melbourne Cup Day: ‘The great racing carnival of Australasia’.

The editor was not sure such addictions to pleasure ‘do not tend to weaken character’ and he rather seems to hope that, though we must have recreation ‘the absorbtion [sic] by it and the intoxication of it will gradually die out as better aims and ambitions come in’.

Of course it was the gambling that he was most against.
