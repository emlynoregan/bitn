Burra Town Council is enquiring into the matter of placing street names in the town.  The Mayor made the suggestion and said the idea had come from a visitor.  It would be quite costly and would be undertaken gradually, starting with the streets branching off the main thoroughfares.  He said he had lived in the town for 25 years and did not know the names of a quarter of the streets.  Prices for same are to be obtained.
