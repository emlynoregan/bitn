At Burra Region Art Gallery 25 regional artists gathered for an artists’ professional development forum on 10 August.  On 12 August more than 100 visitors participated in an installation work depicting a fossilised Diprotodon skeleton recently discovered in the area.  This was facilitated by Marcus Possingham and Roland Weight.  The Band ‘Trochus’ from CASM, the SA Aboriginal Music School entertained the visitors and Burra Gold Club supplied the barbecue lunch.
