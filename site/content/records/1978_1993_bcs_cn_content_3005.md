The Police Lock-up and Stables

Since July students from Years 10 & 11 have been working in the old lock-up and stables at Burra North.  They have been cleaning up the area and carrying out simple restoration work.  They have removed weeds, dirt and rubble and lain out stone ready for the stone mason.  Woodwork has been repaired and painted.  The lock-up apparently dates from 1849.  It is hoped their work will be the foundation of ongoing restoration.
