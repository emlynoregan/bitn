Mayor W. Carpenter writes to say the Council cannot afford to do more than repair the fence at the Children’s Playground and clean the area up.  He suggests a committee be formed to make it a beauty spot.  Part of the adjacent creek area has been grazed in recent years, but it would be better served if stock were kept out and more trees planted and cared for.  The playground needs more modern equipment: some items are out of date and dangerous for young children and a fence along the road is needed.  Water, lawns and lighting would all be assets.
