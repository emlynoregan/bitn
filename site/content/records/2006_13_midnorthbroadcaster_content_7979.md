David Winderlich, Democrat MLC has proposed a network of Heritage Highways throughout the state.  A Copper highway could follow the old copper road from Burra to Pt Wakefield.  A South East Gold Trail could follow the route of Tolmerâ€™s Gold Escorts of the 1850s.  A Goyder Ghost Town and Station Trail could thread through the unsuccessful farming areas of the Mid North and Flinders Ranges, passing through towns like Hammond, Johnburgh and Dawson.
