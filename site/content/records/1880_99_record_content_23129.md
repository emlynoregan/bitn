Football.  (by ‘Quiz’)  There was no practice match because of the rain.  Terowie issues a challenge for a match on 1 September at Burra and calls for a return one in Terowie this season or a forfeit of £5.  ‘Quiz’ thought this rather silly impudence.  A trip to Clare had already been arranged for that date.
