Kooringa News, 14 March

Employment prospects in Kooringa are hopeless, with more men discharged every week.  The wider district provides no solution.  Generally the gold discovery at the Barrier Ranges is doubted here.  Letters coming from the area have not mentioned it and there is no report of shepherds deserting their flocks.

The unemployed met at the Redruth Court House on 14 March to consider the best means of getting work.  Mr MacDermott recommended the men elect two representatives to travel to Adelaide and have interviews with the contractors for the Roseworthy-Forresters Railway and the Pt Wakefield Railway, to see if work could be obtained there.  Mr MacDermott gave £1 to  the clerk of the court to be given to the men after a further £9 had been collected to defray the costs of the delegation to Adelaide.  Another friend left 10/- on the same conditions.
