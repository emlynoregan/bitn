Jazz in the Monster Mine in 2002 has secured Elders SA as the naming rights sponsor.  The event has been given the go-ahead by the Goyder Council.  The site is presently being used by the SA Diving School and site works are required to level the area and remove feral Aleppo pines.  The committee expects to sell all 400 tickets.  Profits from the event are earmarked for the maintenance of Burra’s mining heritage and for the upkeep of Sir Hubert Wilkins’ cottage.  The Twilight Jazz Affair, held for the past four years at Petherton homestead was able to raise much of the funding for the rebuilding of the Wilkins homestead.  The other fixture to use the mine site, the Adelaide Festival country event planned for Burra in mid-March 2002, has been cancelled due to lack of funding.  This had intended to use the grading floor area just inside the gate near Morphett’s Enginehouse.  [Photo showing Diving School activity on the shelf at the water’s edge.]
