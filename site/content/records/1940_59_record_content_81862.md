Burra Bowling Club.  D. Jacka Chairman of the Improvements Committee reported:

Last year we had a concrete floor laid and walls of the tearoom done and since then the building has been completed and painted for the opening of this season.  The banks around Ni. 1 Green were re-formed and a flagpole erected, donated by E.R. Davey.  Toilets were overhauled and a new noticeboard erected.  New canvas blinds were bought for the tearoom and shades have been placed around the greens.  The greens were top dressed.  The last existing old fence has been removed and a new fence erected on the new boundary.  Much work has been done by Bert and Ray Wardle and Bill Field in forming the new greens, saving about Â£150 in cost, before the job was handed over to an expert for completion.
