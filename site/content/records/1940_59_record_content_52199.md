Burra Burra DC, 1 October

Circulars were received from the Department of Agriculture about the spread of Myomatosis.

O.J. Oates has agreed to transfer a portion of land for the deviation of Road 46 to Clare provided the adjacent District Road between sections 2236 and 2245, and between sections 2235 and 2355, is closed and transferred to him.  The Commissioner of Highways seeks Council agreement.

The bonfire at Mt Bryan on 5 November was approved subject to the supervision of Cr Beckwith.
