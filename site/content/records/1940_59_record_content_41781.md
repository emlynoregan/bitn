Cr Woollacott thanked the Mayor and said in his time he had seen many roads bituminised and slag from the slag heap had been used.  He had been the first to realise its potential for roads and was sorry the Council had not purchased the heap.  He had been the main instigator in getting the shed built between Burra & Burra North and would request it be named the Woollacott Shelter.  The Mayor felt the Council would comply with the request.  Cr Bevan also thanked the Mayor for his remarks.
