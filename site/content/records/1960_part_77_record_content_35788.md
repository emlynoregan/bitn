Mr John Robert Barker marked the 50th anniversary of his elected as a Trustee of the Church of St Mary the Virgin on 7 August.  This is the longest anyone has held this position in the local church.  The family has a long association with the church, both in England and Australia and has always taken a keen interest in all church affairs.  His late father William Pitt Barker was also a Trustee of St Maryâ€™s.  Mr Barker is a widower who lives with his two step-daughters, Priscilla and Catherine Brown at the Baldina Homestead.  To commemorate the occasion Mrs Sibly entertained Mr Barker and the other Trustees at the Rectory on Sunday.
