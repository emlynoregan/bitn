Burra Burra DC.  Meeting of 16 July

O’Connor’s shed is to be used to store the baled cardboard and paper recyclable material collected from Burra.

A sign is to be erected acknowledging the work of Senior Citizens in the garden area along the Burra Creek.

Council will loan $3,500 to the Burra Art Gallery interest free for the opening of the gallery – the sum to be repaid by 31 March 1997.

Council will approach the National Trust requesting they take responsibility for the old Burra Record printing machinery on behalf of the Burra Community.
