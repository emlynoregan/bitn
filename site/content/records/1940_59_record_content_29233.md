Burra Town Council, 18 November

Council was invited to the opening of the new RSL Clubrooms.

Council agreed to supply the High School Council with sand and gravel for a cement cricket pitch at cost price.

The lane between Bence’s and Sara’s is to be bituminised from wall to wall to prevent the surface being washed into the drains and so blocking them.
