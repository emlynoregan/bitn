Burra Town Council, 20 November

The SAR says the station road will receive attention.

The Chief Secretary says he will gladly meet a deputation from Council about representation on the hospital Board, though he will not be in Burra in the very near future.

The Highways Department says it has rebuilding of the Bon Accord Bridge under consideration.

L.J. Eason, Head Teacher of Burra High School, thanks the Council for repairs to tennis courts and asks for costs so he can claim the departmental subsidy.

Cr Lee says Lewis’s Bridge was too far gone for repair and moved that a new bridge be repaired [sic: perhaps ‘prepared’] according to the estimate submitted by the Overseer.  Cr Carpenter seconded.

The Mayor queried whether it was needed at once.

Cr Kellaway moved it stand over till Council had inspected the bridge.

Cr Lee said a similar motion had been made long ago and there had been ample time to inspect the bridge.

Cr Carpenter said it had been inspected and the estimate of £22-10-0 for repair had been submitted by the Overseer.  The bridge was in a bad state.  Amendment lost and motion carried.
