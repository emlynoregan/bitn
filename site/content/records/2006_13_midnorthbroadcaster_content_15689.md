The Burra-Morgan Car Run last weekend created quite a buzz in Burra and that feeling continues today with a visit from the Warrnambool & District Historical Vehicles Club.  Twelve vehicles are involved in their trip to Broken Hill and while in Burra they will do the Passport Trail and most will stay at Paxton Cottages.  They are here for two days.

The Northern Automotive Restoration Club visited Burra on Saturday with vehicles that included a 100-year-old Vauxhall and a 1913 Triumph.

Activities at the weekend included a trip to Gallyâ€™s Meeting House at Farrell Flat on Sunday.

The re-enactment of the 1906 run from Burra to Morgan was a great success.  This was the third re-enactment of recent times, starting with the centenary event of 2006.  It is popular as a long run without traffic problems.
