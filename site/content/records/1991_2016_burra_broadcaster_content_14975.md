Public Meeting re Over-policing

More than 300 people attended the meeting called as a result of pressure on senior police to address allegations of over-policing.  Council CEO Steve Kerrigan acted as an independent convenor and said has view was that what was needed was an atmosphere of two-way commitment between the police and community.  Police were represented by Superintendent Dave Eason from Adelaide, Divisional Commander Jim Langmead from Pt Pirie and senior Sergeant Dean Harris from Peterborough.

Jim Langmead said police resources had been directed towards reducing the road toll through random breath tests and speed detection and they could make no apologies for that.

Local farmer Graham Kellock said constant radar guns and breatho’s in front of businesses were discouraging people from coming into town.

Matthew Reilly spoke of being inundated with complaints about police officers.

Rosemary Seaford said that as a representative of senior women, she described policing now as rude, arrogant, intimidating, threatening and demeaning.  She wanted a return to firmness and respect and called for respectful and confidential policing – to which she received a standing ovation.

Charlie Bourne, wishing to represent the younger generation, said he had no issue with the law, but urged officers to act with dignity and honour.

James Hawker spoke in support of Officer Russell Disher who is currently on stress leave.

Jack McMahon said you couldn’t umpire without a whistle and acting now could avert a problem down the track.

Chief Inspector Eason said everyone’s personalities were different and if they had genuine concerns they were there to see if they could fix it.

Gary Illicevs, a resident with 17 years police experience, said the police needed to have the confidence of the town – ‘we are not complaining about the law’.

Rosemary Seaford moved a motion prepared by a meeting of about 60 locals held the previous night:

‘That the residents of Burra and the surrounding districts object to the aggressive policing of officers Cousins and Kaiser, and the adverse affect [sic] this has on our community.  It creates a definite sense of loss for the community: that the SA Police Department note that this is a vote of no confidence in the two officers and that action be taken to replace them with officers respected, knowledgeable and experienced in community policing.’

This motion was amended to say that the Burra community wait until the police investigation is made until the issue of no confidence is further considered.

The amendment was carried 125 to 110.

Six people were then elected from the meeting to consider the issues raised with senior police and then report back to the community as soon as possible.
