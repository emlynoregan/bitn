Foxes are very numerous this season and with no young rabbits about yet, they are turning to the rabbits caught in rabbitersâ€™ traps.  One trapper recently found that of 120 rabbits in his traps only 20 were of any use to him because foxes had accounted for the remainder.  Unfortunately fox skins at present are fetching only 6d each.
