Immunisations.  Thirty-two children from Hallett and Willalo Schools were immunised for diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus on Wednesday 15 August.  For many it was the last needle in the course, but for others a further two needles will be given on 19 September and 17 October.  Only one is needed if children were immunised as infants.
