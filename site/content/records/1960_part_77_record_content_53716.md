Cattle for Koonoona.  Possibly the largest consignment of cattle ever to arrive in Burra by rail was unloaded yesterday en route to Koonoona.  The cattle left Oodnadatta on Saturday morning and were transhipped at Marree and Peterborough, arriving at Burra at 11.30 a.m. yesterday.  The mob of 510 cattle was walked to the property.
