Cricket.  The club met on Thursday evening at the Institute to wind up the season.  The best batsman for the season was J.P. Richardson with an av. 39.9 over 22 innings.  Best bowler was N.D. Keats and best fielding was by W. Tiver and J.P. Richardson, the latter was also best all-rounder.  Financially the year started badly with a deficit of £3-0-3, old matting and an unsafe pitch.  Now the club has a new pitch, good string matting and a good supply of tools in reasonable order.  20 matches have been played against outside teams of which 14 were won and 3 lost with 3 drawn.  Finances have been difficult, but after expending £41-2-10 the club ended with a credit of 13/1.  Concerts brought in £10-8-3 profit for the season.
