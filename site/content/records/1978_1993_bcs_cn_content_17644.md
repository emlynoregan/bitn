Burra Kindergarten

The introduction of CSO Rural Policy will see Burra Kindergarten sessions reduced from five to four a week for 1989.  The policy aims to provide four sessions for all pre-school children.  Burra’s loss will mean another centre will gain a session to make four.  Staffing at Burra will also be reduced so Burra will have 0.4 Director, 0.4 teacher and 0.2 aide – i.e. the Director and teacher for four sessions and the aide for two sessions.  The decision about which session to lose will be made at the AGM on 5 December.
