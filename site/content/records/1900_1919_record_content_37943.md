Burra Town Council, 4 May.

Bagot, Shakes and Lewis to be written to and told to remove verandah posts from the footpath.

Sympathy expressed for Cr Walker on his wife’s death.

Another appeal will be made to the Deputy Post Master General to get reduced telephone charges to Adelaide.

The Chief Secretary wrote re the Hospital Board.  The Board had 11 members and he had no power to admit more.  The only way to admit the Mayor would be to drop an existing member.  The Board had been asked to change its rules, but at present nothing had been done.

[The problem was that the previous Mayor, Mr McLaren, was still sitting on the Board, though correspondence in 1912 seemed to indicate that the Governor had appointed him for one year c. March 1912.  Mr McLaren took the view that he was appointed personally, not as Mayor, whereas the Council was of the opinion that he had been appointed as the Council’s representative and should therefore have resigned on leaving Council.  The fact that he had lost the election to Mr Crewes at the end of 1913 might have influenced his decision to stay on.]

Further correspondence with the Chief Secretary was initiated.

Cr Radford referred to an old shaft at the back of Fuss’s which had only a low fence to protect children.  The owners’ to be told to fence it or otherwise attend to the danger.  The owners were Sincock & Burchell of Moonta and the shaft was about 80’ deep.  The Council had fenced it on their behalf about 4 years ago, but last year Mr Woollacott had driven over the place and knocked the fence down.

Father O’Halloran is communicating with the Bishop re handing over a certain piece of ground in exchange for setting aside a certain portion of the cemetery for Catholic adherents.

Council will inspect the Market Square pump with a view to upgrading or modernising it.

There was debate about unsatisfactory acetylene gas lamps in streets.

The lamplighter’s pay is to be withheld until lamps are satisfactory.

A portion of Lane Garden belongs to the Hon. J. Lewis and he wants it settled with the Council legally.
