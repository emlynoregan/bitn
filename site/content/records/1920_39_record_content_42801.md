A.L. Clode asked to lease a piece of creek opposite the shop of R. Fuss; part of St Just St.  He would fence and gate it and pay 5/- p.a. for five years.

Cr March was in favour of granting the request, as it would prevent stock being taken through ‘Toorak’ as that part of the town was called.  Request granted.

The Town Clerk said in the month £62 in rates was collected including fines.  £70 of current rates were outstanding and £30 in arrears, mostly on unclaimed blocks.  Since the report was written a further £30 has come in.

Three men had taken cattle away from the Ranger as he took them to the pound.  Mr Bednall suggested they be asked for an explanation and to pay the Ranger’s fee of 5/- at least.  The penalty for interfering with an officer of the Council was £5.

The Mayor said dogs in the street were another problem.

Cr Bevan said the three young men didn’t know the seriousness of the offence and he moved no further action be taken if they paid the poundage fee, the ranger’s fee, the cost of the solicitor’s letter and apologised.  Carried.

Repairs were ordered to the street near Mr Villis’s, as Mr Short was almost isolated.
