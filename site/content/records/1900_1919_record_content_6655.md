The season.  The prospects in the Hundreds of Schumburg [sic] and Lindley are particularly bad with so little rain there is virtually no wheat up and little more grass.  Some farmers have lost all their horses and around Morgan things are worse if anything.

[These are the two most easterly Hundreds in the County of Burra and lie towards Morgan.  The Hundred of Schomburgk has since 1918 been called Maude.]
