Harry J. Williams of Mylor writes asking that his two sons be put on the Burra Honour Roll.  Both were born at Kooringa.  They are LAC R.H. Williams and AC1 H.W. Williams.  Mr Williams was born in Thames St in a house where the croquet green is now and is a son of the late Mr & Mrs W. Williams of Paxton Square.  His mother was for 45 years the caretaker of St Mary’s, an office his sister Edith now holds.  When in Burra he was a teamster carting wool for I.J. Warnes and A.J. & P.A. McBride.  He married Miss Hilda E. Williams of Ironmine.
