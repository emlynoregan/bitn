Frank Treloar: Looking Back (Continued)

Schneider’s was the first shaft fitted with an engine and boiler.  The boiler and engine were carted to Burra by Joe Freeman.  Later he kept the Pig & Whistle [Hotel] which stood on the allotment in Thames St opposite Alf Gebhardt’s new house.  Later it was found that a main water shaft with a powerful engine was needed and Morphett’s Shaft was sunk.  For this Ambrose Harris built the chimney stack at 11/6 per yard (demolished some years ago for building material in the town).  Thomas Paynter built the engine room.  The jinker to carry the machinery to Burra came out from England with it and William Woollacott got the contract to transport it to Burra – I believe for £500.  Two poles were fixed to the jinker so that four bullocks could work abreast and they started with 32 bullocks, but later used 40.  A plentiful supply of fresh bullocks was also needed to share the work.  Three bullock drays with accessories also came along.  The team for the boiler required four and sometimes six drivers.  The negotiation of the numerous creeks and gullies was a perpetual worry and cause of delay.  The eventual arrival had everyone turn out to see the event.  Of those who witnessed it few survive today: Mr & Mrs Sam Baker, Mr Elias Wilks, Mr Richard Reed and perhaps a few others.  William Woollacott was the grandfather of the present generation in the town.  The site of Morphett’s Shaft was chosen to drain the mine, but also to allow the water from it to be reticulated all over the mine by wooden overhead launders to drive waterwheels which would then power all the equipment to prepare the ore for delivery to the smelters.  There were six men employed just to keep the shaft in order (3 on and 3 off).  The late John Snell worked there for years and later his son Joe.  At its maximum it could pump eight strokes a minute, but it was rarely worked at more than six – each stroke raised 400 gallons.  For a 24 hour day of work it consumed 14 tons of wood: about 100 tons a week.  There is little wonder the area was stripped of timber.  There must be enough timber buried in the mine to keep the town in firewood for 25 years.  Morphett’s engine and pump allowed the mine to enter its period of greatest prosperity.

From the start there was a club and doctor’s fund to which men contributed 1/- a week and boys 6d.  It gave in return medical attention at 14/- a week.  A hospital was built opposite the Mill and Dr Mayne was the first medical man.  A reserve of 3,000 tons of firewood was built up and sawn timber was constantly arriving.  Henry Solly of Leasingham received £10 for delivering a special log for Morphett’s engine house and £14 for two very large stones.

The Fred Collins Family received farewells from the Masonic Lodge and Kooringa Methodist Sunday School that are reported.

Elizabeth A. Ward writes again expressing her dismay at “Bewildered’s” attitude and outlining her view that the guns that were so hard fought for represent the sacrifice of the men in the AIF and need to be kept and maintained.

‘On Guard’ also writes saying that the captured guns were placed by the monument to honour the fallen as they were captured from the enemy in those dark days and are now moved to a place of no importance.  The writer regards this as ‘a mockery to that silent figure’ on the monument.
