Obituary.  Henry Nourse Thompson, aged 82 years 6 months died at ‘Three Trees’ near Burra on 21 September.  He was born 15 March 1826 at Kings Lynn, Norfolk and came to SA in 1852.  He was thus a colonist of 56 years.  He was an accountant at the Burra Mine and later storekeeper there.  He planted the Moreton Bay figs at the Mine Store.  He was a great friend of Josiah Thomas’s father and for that reason Mr Thomas took the deceased to live with him at Three Trees.  He was there for 40 years.  One of his legs was amputated when he was 12 years old.  He was a well educated and widely read gentleman and was a relative of the Mine’s chief accountant, Mr Challener [sic] [Challoner]

[Henry Nourse Tomson died 21 September 1908 at ‘Three Trees’ near Burra aged 81.]
