Letter to Ed. from ‘Outsider’ complaining about the issuing of distress warrants for unpaid rates. As they have £245-7-5 ‘in hand’ they would be better advised to sort out the bridge approach muddle [Kingston St] and ‘getting a road opened from the north west corner of Paxton Square to Hampton so as to give access to Public School, cattle yards and Brewery (singular trio) before the hitherto liberal S.A.M.A. place too high a value on their land and make the affair [sic] to [sic] expensive . . .‘ There are ‘ample opportunities of displaying their genius without troubling themselves about Bridge abutments being a little asquue [sic]. 
[The editor is not sympathetic to these comments and he answers the points raised.]
