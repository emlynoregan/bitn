Ironmine Methodist Church Jubilee Services were held on 16 October.  Rev. R.J. Daddow, who preached there 47 years ago returned to conduct the services.  The church opened as a Primitive Methodist Church in 1871 and continued as such till Methodist Union in 1900.  Rev. Daddow also addressed the public meeting on Monday.  Mr J. Goodridge spoke of his first attendance more than 49 years ago.  Mesdames J. Goodridge and A. Smith took the collection and both had been present at the opening service.  The collection will go towards the Memorial Hall shortly to be erected to the Fallen Soldiers of Ironmine.
