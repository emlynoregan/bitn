The Government cannot allow a larger ration for one sector of the community.  Little timber is needed and is available locally.  If the men will submit a tender for the supply of 2,000 gallons of water a week we will do something.  It is not possible to forgo the motor licence fee.  Installation of a battery is not at present justified.  No arrangements can be made for free carriage and crushing of 10 tons of ore.  There is already provision for free crushing of 25 tons of ore from a new property, if it is deemed justified by the General Manager of State Batteries.  No preferential treatment concerning boots and clothing is possible.  The Unemployment Relief Council will soon issue clothing and some more tools will be sent.  A tent will be sent when the enclosed form is completed for the man needing one.
