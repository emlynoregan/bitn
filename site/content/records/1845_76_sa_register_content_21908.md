Burra News, 6 May

Accident/Obituary.  A 16-month-old child of Mr Richard Reed, sheep farmer of Wandillah, was sent out to play with the rest in the morning.  An hour later the child was found sitting in a small galvanised iron washing pan with its head hanging over the side, dead, but warm.  The pan contained about three inches of soapy water.  It is conjectured that the infant fell into the pan face down and struggled into a sitting position while nearly suffocated, and through its head falling over the side of the pan was unable to breathe freely and so died.

[Emma Reed born 6 February 1867 at Wandillah: died 2 May 1868 at Wandillah.]

Thanksgiving services were offered at all the Protestant places of worship except the Anglican Church last Sunday for the preservation of the life of HRH the Duke of Edinburgh.

The bridge across the Mine Creek is progressing favourably and does great credit to the contractors Messrs Tiver and Woollacott.  [The Mine Bridge]

The Burra Mine will soon wear a livelier aspect as it is proposed to begin erecting the engine house at the new [Graves’] shaft immediately.  From such a costly decision we infer that the Mine will soon restart underground operations.

Rev. L.W. Stanton gave another of his popular entertainments assisted by Mrs Smith of Redruth, Misses Young, K. Stanton, Drew and Dawson.  The object was to raise funds for the aid of the librarian Mr Cross who has been seriously ill and has not yet recovered.

[The only people of this name to die in Burra were Francis Cross who died 9 January 1872 aged 61 and his wife Sarah who died 13 June 1876 aged 69.  Their BISA entry says Francis was a labourer and tailor, with no  mention of the librarian’s job, but this could well have been something he turned to as his health failed.]
