Kooringa News, 5 May

Rev. J. Hancock delivered a lecture at the Mechanics’ Institute on Habit viewed in connection with the moral agency of man.  Rev. J. Warner presided and the hall was well filled.  J. Pearce and family provided musical accompaniment with voice and harmonium.

E.H. Grafe has been obliged to call his creditors together – business being flat and too much booking going on and insufficient money being earned for the working people to pay their way.

Messrs Jaffrey, Kingston and the Chief Secretary with Messrs Tomkinson and Cameron arrived last night on a visit to the mine.
