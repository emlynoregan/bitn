Obituary/Drowning.   Robert Dawson, son of Mrs E.J. & the late Mr Dawson of North Booborowie drove with Clem James of Booborowie (aged 14) to a waterhole on the property of Mr D.S. Craig on Sunday afternoon.  Mr Dawson dived in and after a few seconds came to the surface waving his arms, but saying nothing.  Clem James went to assist and twice tried unsuccessfully to get the deceased to the bank.  He then got assistance from J.M.S. Websterâ€™s place about half a mile away.  The body was eventually found in about 8ft of water.  Dr Steele attended.  It is thought that the deceased either fainted or had a heart attack.  Coroner E.J. Davey deemed an inquest unnecessary after hearing the police report.  Mr Dawson would have been 22 today.  [Robert John Dawson born 24 November 1905 near Strathalbyn: died 20 November 1927 at North Booborowie.]
