Burra Electricity

Mr Lea, Chairman of ETSA, said the Trust was very interested in Burra and could extend a line from Waterloo, about 25 miles, for Â£30,000.  The charges for electricity would be much lower than those presently made.  A shortage of labour and materials meant this could not be achieved before October 1953.  ETSA could take over the existing powerhouse at any time and boost the output, if needed, with a new engine, until ETSA lines reached Burra.  The Burra Electric Supply Co. has an agreement which terminates in 1952, but ETSA would like to see it carry on till they can take over in 1953.
