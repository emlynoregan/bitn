Burra Tennis Association will start matches on 16 October.  A new A2 Grade has been created from the bottom of last year’s ‘A’ Grade and the top of last year’s ‘B’ Grade, to even up competition and reduce the number of teams in ‘A’ Grade.  There will now be 8 in ‘A’ Grade, 6 in ‘A2’ Grade, 6 in ‘B’ Grade and 8 in Junior Grade.  There will be a total of 224 players each Saturday.  Regrettably Leighton Tennis Club has gone into recess.
