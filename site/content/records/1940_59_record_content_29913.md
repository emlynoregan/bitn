Burra Rifle Club.  The Defence Department has sent out a circular that all Rifle Clubs should be in full swing by March.  Members and intending members not in possession of a .303 will receive one after signing the necessary form.  Payment can be £4 cash or £4-15-0 at the rate of £1 p.a. with the 15/- waived if the member is ‘efficient’.  Ammunition will be plentiful: 100 rounds free per member on enrolment and 20 rounds for each efficient member the previous year.  Also on purchase, £2-10-0 per 1,000 rounds.  All rounds at prize meetings and 5,000 rounds for State Teams practices.
