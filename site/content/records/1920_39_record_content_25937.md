Deputy Director of Posts & Telegraph, Mr Ramsay, visited Burra on 20 February together with the District Postal Inspector, Mr A.W. White.  They were given a civic reception.  Cr Woollacott raised the question of the townâ€™s name.  Burra was not known to the Post Office and yet only Burra was known to the railways.  Mr Ramsay said the name of the town was not in his jurisdiction, but if the names were changed from Aberdeen and Kooringa to North Burra and South Burra there would be no objection as long as there were no other towns of that name.
