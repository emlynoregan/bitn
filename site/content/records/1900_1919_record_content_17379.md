Obituary.  Matilda Marie Dow, wife of Gerald Dow, died on 30 May, aged 32 in North Adelaide.

[Born Matilda Augusta Maria Oppermann 2 January 1872 near Redruth.]

Mrs G. Dow, wife of G. Dow, the popular relieving telegraph operator, died following an operation for cancer in the throat.  She was 32.  She was in fact entirely responsible for the prizes won at numerous flower shows under the name of her father Mr C. Oppermann.  Her displays were the greatest attraction of the shows.  She was also noted for her fruit displays.  She was a sister of Mrs E.A. Topperwein and Amelia of Parkside also William, Albert and Charles of Burra.

The late Mrs Dow complained of a throat affection last September and it was first thought to be the result of a severe cold, but was later discovered to be a growth.  Eminent city physicians said it was a most unusual case with the growth right in the larynx.  An operation never before attempted was performed about three weeks ago.  In spite of the seriousness of the operation the patient rallied and was bright and hopeful.  After a while the illness had to receive further treatment and even then she did not suffer a collapse.  The case was watched with keen interest by medical men, but on Thursday news was received of her sudden death and on Friday she was buried at Kooringa.  30-40 traps formed the cortege and members of the Lily of the Valley Tent IOR marched in front of the hearse.  Sister A. Snell read a Rechabite service at the graveside.  Rev. Ebbs conducted the church service.  Mrs Dow had taken a prominent part in church matters, especially in the annual strawberry fete.

For many years the Burra Horticultural Society had benefited by the contribution of the Oppermann family to shows and though the prizes were in the name of Mr C. Oppermann, the late Mrs Dow was entirely responsible for the unqualified success of her fatherâ€™s exhibits, for to her the growing, arranging and staging was confidently left.  How well she accomplished her work is still fresh in the minds of all lovers of flowers in the district.  Her displays were invariably the greatest attraction of the show, containing as they did designs novel and unique in addition to an array of beautiful colours that blended admirably together.  Her successes ranged from the miniature buttonhole to giant chrysanthemums.
