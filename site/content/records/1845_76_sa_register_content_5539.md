Cornwall & Devon Society met on 7 January, with Mr J.B. Neales, the permanent Chairman, presiding.

The Chairman said that the land purchased by him on account of the Gold Company entitled the introduction of 73 persons and the Emu Flats purchase to a similar number.  The orders had been handed to the SA Mining Association who had posted a notice at the mine calling on miners to send in the names of relatives they were anxious to have sent out from home.  The Directors selected the required number of the most eligible persons.  It was not generally known, or at least not generally acted upon, that the purchase of 80 acres entitled the buyer to introduce three adults to the colony.

[Neales then went on to list the amount of copper ore sent home from mines other than the Burra Burra and the Kapunda mines and said it totalled 10,000 tones, with a value of £150,000 at £15 per ton.  Also some £15,000 worth of silver-lead had been sent home from the Glen Osmond Mine.  These figures indicated the highly remunerative employment that awaited the skill and enterprise of the Cornish miner.]
