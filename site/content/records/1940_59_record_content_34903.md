Letter.  J. Leo Hawke writes as President of the Burra & District War Memorial Committee, to explain the apparent inactivity of that committee.

Firstly their appeal for public subscriptions seems to have been upstaged by the Red Cross Movie Star Competition.  Now that event is over, their appeal may again come to the fore.

Secondly the £400 voted to the project by the Town Council has not come to hand.  Apparently the Federal

Treasurer has ruled that no re-imbursement can be made if that money is expended, but he has granted the Corporation the right to raise a loan for that amount, which, if spent on the Victoria Park War Memorial project, will be duly reimbursed: one third by the Federal Treasury and one third by the State Treasury, leaving the Town Council to pay the remaining one third.

Mr Hawke can see no reason why, subject to approval by the Federal Treasurer, the Council could not raise a loan of £1,200 and get a £400 reimbursement from each of the Treasuries, leaving the Council to find £400, which they already hold in bonds and which was voted to the War Memorial Committee last July.

If this were to be done the Council would expend £400 instead of the £133-6-8, but would gain an asset valued at between £3,000 and £3,500.

To answer some critics, he explains why the development could not take place at the racecourse.

Legal advice was that unless the syndicate could transfer ownership to the Town Council or the War Memorial Committee the site would not qualify as a War Memorial project.

The syndicate believed that to transfer the site would be a breach of trust.

At a regular meeting of ratepayers on 14 July 1947 it was decided to erect a War Memorial at Victoria Park.

What are the plans for Victoria Park?

The oval itself is to be regraded to reduce the fall from east to west to 8 feet instead of the present 14 feet.

The oval will be planted with suitable grasses.

A saucer cycle track will be put down and a new fence erected immediately round the cycle track.
