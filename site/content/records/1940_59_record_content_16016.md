Salvation Army Sunday School Picnic was held at Sod Hut on 3 January.  Difficulties with petrol were solved when Mr Nankivell lent a spring trolly and Mr Irlam a horse team.  (The trip down took two hours.)  Sports were held after lunch.  They started back at 6 p.m. after tea and ended with an ice cream at Mr Wandke’s restaurant, courtesy of Mr R.T. Cox, Capt. Cox’s father.
