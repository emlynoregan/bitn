Burra Town Council

The Aberdeen Tennis Club, having spent £150 on its courts since the war, needed another £140 to bring the four into good order.  One donor offered £70 and the club can raise £35 and they appealed to the Town Council for £35.  The Mayor thought it was a good investment, as the courts were Council property.
