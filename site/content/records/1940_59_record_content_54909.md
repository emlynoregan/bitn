Football.  A chaotic game took place at Terowie on Saturday.  The umpire lacked control and the game was played to Raffertyâ€™s Rules.  The last quarter ran for 45 minutes before both captains and the umpire decided to call it a day, by which time it was so dark spectators could hardly distinguish the players.  It was then 5.45 and the time-keepers still maintained there was 1 minute 15 seconds to go.  Booborowie 14-23 defeated Terowie 7.13.

Hallett 8.16 defeated Leighton 5.5.

Burra 16.8 defeated Spalding 5.5

[The symmetry of these figures may be coincidence, but they look suspect.]
