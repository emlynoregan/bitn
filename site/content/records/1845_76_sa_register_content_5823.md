Kooringa Election

On 6 March a crowd of between 200 and 300 gathered at the Burra Hotel.  Mr W.R. Mortlock was voted into the chair and he outlined the reason for the meeting; to discuss the merits of the two candidates for the coming election.

Dr Bull said that at last their town with a population of more than 4,000 and the second largest in the colony was at last to have a candidate for itself.

Dr Bull asked what merits had Mr Kingston, judging from his speech the previous Monday.  His address amounted to little more than an echo of Mr Langâ€™s principles except on the question of the ballot, and on that he has no opinion at all.  Or at least not the courage to declare an opinion.  But no Burra Director, whatever superior claims he might have to Mr Kingston, will be the best member to represent our interests.
