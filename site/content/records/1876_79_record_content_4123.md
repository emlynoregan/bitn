Coaches now run to Menindie, Mingarie, via Umberumberka, Thakeringa & Mt Gipps. [Mingarie = Mingary, about 26 km before the NSW border on the highway/railway line, Thakaringa, about 14 km over the border on the road to Broken Hill, Umberumberka is just north of Silverton in NSW and Mt Gipps is N-E of Silverton in the Barrier Ranges. If it really is via these places to Menindie which lies to the SE of Broken Hill, it was a very roundabout journey.]
