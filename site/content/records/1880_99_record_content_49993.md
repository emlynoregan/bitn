Copper Comments: from a letter to the Advertiser by John Richards.

There are prospects of a rise in prices for copper.  A price of £65 per ton would be the equivalent of £95 per ton 20 years ago due to reduced costs of modern smelting.  In the 1850s ships changed from copper-bottomed wood to iron and use of copper fell, but otherwise it has risen.  Consumption per head:

in the USA:		in Britain

1850	0.550 lb

1860	0.405 lb

1870	0.603 lb

1880	1.006 lb	1880	2.477 lb

1890	3.002 lb	1890	3.084 lb

Electricity usage and communications offer a bright outlook.
