Letter from Doug Wiltshire, Burra

‘In response to the letter last week, several matters deserve comment.

Firstly, I did not circulate the Notice referred to. The Notice was photocopied and circulated by an unknown number of Councillors within one day of it’s [sic] receipt by them.

The Notice was marked Private and Confidential and was not intended to be made public, but having been made public by some of the recipients, there was no point in continuing to hold it confidential. Councillor Gill has actually done the community a favour by publishing it.

Secondly, the Notice was dated 18 November and served on the following day. Councillors were given 30 days to respond which they chose not to, nevertheless, the period specified was allowed. The Minutes of Council dated 19th November 2002, item 561/02 state “That Council reject the content of the letter received by each Councillor from Mr. D. Wiltshire and that although individual Councillors may seek their own advice, the Chief Executive Officer seek legal advice on the matter.”

Councillor Gill may like to inform ratepayers of the amount expended in legal fees on this and all other matters which have been the subject of my investigation, as there have been many, because this information would be in keeping with Council’s own supposed Policy of open, honest and transparent dealings with ratepayers, but I won’t hold my breath waiting!

Thirdly, Lawyers acting in this matter didn’t return from holidays until end of January 2003, and as there is still considerable evidence to be gathered before formal proceedings can be issued, it may be several months before anything materialises, considering the fact that Council continue to frustrate my efforts to gain vital information under Freedom of Information Requests, as they have done over the past six months.

Fourthly, Councillor Gill and others should be under no illusion that the matter will proceed to Court given all evidence being obtained. The fact that he and others may propose to renominate in the upcoming election is purely up to them, because they know the consequences proposed in the Notice served on them, and it makes no difference to proceedings whether they are in Council or not.

Doug Wiltshire. Burra’
