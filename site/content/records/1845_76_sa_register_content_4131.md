Burra Lodge of the Independent Order of Oddfellows M.U. assembled on Thursday 29 November to witness the laying of a foundation stone for a new lodge room about to be erected in Kooringa.  The lodge has been open about nine months and has about 100 members.  This has become too many for the large room at the Burra Burra Hotel, used until now for meetings.  Under the stone was laid a bottle containing a Burra Burra order for 5/-, a Patent Copper Co. order for 5/- , a Boord Bros order for 5/- and a Wrenâ€™s order for 5/-, a piece of refined copper from the smelters, a list of the brothers and a written explanation of the contents.  Rev. Bro. Pollitt delivered a short address.  The procession then returned to the Burra Burra Hotel for a sumptuous repast, at which almost 100 sat down.  The Noble Grand took the chair, supported by Rev. Bro. Pollitt, W. Lang Esq.; Bro. George Bull, Surgeon to the Lodge; Bro. Dr Chambers and other gentlemen.
