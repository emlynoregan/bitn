BCS.  An unexpected rise in school numbers this year has seen staffing levels remain unchanged at the year 2000 level.  In 2001 a five year program to repaint and repair the exterior of the school was completed.  Other improvements were the renovation and expansion of the administrative area, new locker facilities for Years 8 to10 and upgrading of the lighting in the Library and the Art Room.  The gymnasium floor was stripped, sanded and then resealed.  The pathway from the school to Bridge Terrace was resealed along with the playing area and the school farm on Brewery Hill now has a shearing shed.
