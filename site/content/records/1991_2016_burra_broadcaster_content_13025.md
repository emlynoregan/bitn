Letter.  Joe Kazimour of Joe’s Super Snacks, Prices Bakery and Golden Fried Chicken writes a very long letter, taking exception to the decision-making process re his illuminated sign that was recently disallowed for his business in Market Square.  Some of his points:

When he invested in the Golden Fried chicken franchise the deal included an internally illuminated two-sided sign designed to be set at 90º to the building and high enough for all to see.

When he applied for permission to erect the sign the initial reactions from John Brak and Douglas Alexander (Heritage Adviser) were so negative that he immediately regretted having placed the order for the franchise.

Although the sign carried a trademark registered all over Australia, the Council wanted a change of colour and design.

He agreed to mount the sign flat against the parapet.

He then found that a single-sided sign cost as much as a two-sided one ($500) so he opted for the latter and applied for permission to mount it at 90º to the parapet – and was refused.

Mr Alexander objected because:

This was contrary to what he was originally advised.

The site was highly visible in Market Square, the focus of the State Heritage Area, which would be adversely affected.

The corporate design and colouring are not sympathetic to the individual historic character of the square.

The sign would lead to the proliferation of similar inappropriate signage.

If Council did not adopt Mr Alexander’s recommendation it would be necessary to obtain the concurrence of the Development Assessment Commission.

Mr Kazimour then comments on the already installed illuminated signs – some at 90º to the buildings on the Service Stations, BankSA, Hotels and Lotteries Commission – BUT let’s not disturb ‘Big Businesses’.

Council voted to allow the sign 6 votes to 2.

Mr Kazimour then writes at length on the negative decision of the Development Assessment Commission and the biased way it rushed into its decision, railing against the role of the Heritage Adviser and the consequent negative impact on the town’s economic progress as the result of such heritage nonsense that is supported by ‘Douglas Alexander and his Heritage Stooges’.
