Much time was then spent on debating the raising of road metal and screenings for tar-dressing.

Further debate on weighbridges followed and Cr Kellock moved that Mr Rogers’ challenge to test his weighs be taken up: not to win the £10 on offer, but to satisfy the public of Mr Rogers’ honesty.  Carried.

The road from the gate to the station was in a shocking state.  The Town Clerk said the ganger had said the work done was temporary and it was intended to tar-dress it.
