Editorial comment on the Ratepayers’ Meeting.

The Mayor and present and intending councillors took seats on the platform except for Councillors Rabbich and Parks, who took chairs in the body of the hall.  Throughout proceedings this resulted in cries of ‘hear, hear’ from the floor and sounds of support for councillors’ speeches, which at first appeared to be coming from the general audience, but upon examination were seen to emanate from Crs Rabbich & Parks.  Other ratepayers’ found their performance quite amusing and ‘removed buttons in trying not to laugh too loud’.

Cr Rabbich trotted around the hall relieving himself of a whisper to one and then another.  When he said he had often run away from his tea to get to a Council meeting it could not be swallowed by the audience.  ‘Whoever heard of the infatuated Tom shying clear of good things to eat.  Not Much!’

‘Cr Hardy filled the part of “Can Can Billy” in a creditable style and evoked considerable laughter.  He said he had nothing to say about half a dozen times, and as often told the ratepayers he was reserving his most mysterious and sensational antics until a more convenient season.’

Mr T.P. Halls, who is running for West Ward almost, brought the house down when he told ratepayers they would see his views when he got into Council.

Mr Winnall made a favourable impression.

Cr Harris was subjected to cries of ‘That Wood’ from the floor: indeed he is often referred to by that epithet.  He said he would not again trouble the ratepayers.

Cr Sampson had a minor altercation with one questioner, but escaped uninjured and the meeting dispersed about 9 o’clock.
