In the past 17 years there have been 26 accidents her, three of them fatalities.  Following the recent death there of a Broken Hill youth on a motor cycle, the coroner, Mr M.C .Abbott, asked for an inspection of the site.  It is hoped it will soon be renovated to make a better angle for road safety.  In the meantime signage has been improved.
