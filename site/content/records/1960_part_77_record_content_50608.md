Obituary.  Mrs Marjorie Bell died on Sunday.  She was the widow of the late Rev. A.H. Bell, at one time Methodist Minister at Hallett.

[NOTE: corrected 92, 14, 14 Apr. 1970 page 7.  This report is not true.  Rev. Albert Bell was born 29 December 1896 Hetton Down, Co. Durham, UK and died 20 February 1963, Hallett.  See extended obituary 37, 9, 5 Mar. 1963, page 4.  He is said to have married a Miss Ivison Holliday.  The mistake came from the death of Marjorie Gladys Bell on 6 April 1970 at Brighton aged 79, the widow of an Arthur Hammond Bell.]
