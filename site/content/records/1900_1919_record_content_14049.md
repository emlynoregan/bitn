Messrs George & Harry Lockyer, after many years residence, are about to leave Burra.  Both were in partnership with their brother, Edward in the Unicorn Brewery, but this was disposed of recently and the hotels are sold or about to be sold.  George will go to the city and Harry to Robe where it is probable he will take a hotel.  George was a founder member of the Burra Orchestra as a violinist.  Harry served two terms as North Ward Councillor on the Town Council.
