Leo & Janet Sturmen of Burra write to complain that the Council has assumed a storm water easement across their property based on long usage, making a de facto easement, but they are refusing to acknowledge it as an easement required under the Local Government Act, which would appear on their title.  This debases the value of the property and creates a legal quagmire.
