Mrs Gwen Blight was presented with £208-10-0 before she left Mt Bryan to live at Tumby Bay.  Mrs Blight thanked all donors for the money and the help given to Clem during his illness and his term of office at Mt Bryan. [He had been the head teacher at Mt Bryan School, was a returned serviceman from WWII, and died in February 1954 after having a leg amputated.]
