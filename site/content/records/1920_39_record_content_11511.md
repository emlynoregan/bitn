[Note Ann Trotter married John Lavoun 17 Apr. 1856 and he died 10 Apr. 1880.  She then married George Jordan 7 Dec. 1885 and he died 7 July 1900.  Only six children seem to be registered in SA and of them only one marriage and one death is registered, though the spelling of the surname complicated searches as it appears variously as Lavine, Lavoun, Lavourn, Lavowrn, Lavann and Levan (at least).  No Louie is registered as being born in SA, but in 1962 a Louise Lavoun (single) died at Felixstow aged 88.  The married daughter alive in 1923 would seem to be Bessie, born 1 Aug. 1867, who married George Samuel Cryer at Pt Pirie in 1897 and died 15 Dec. 1938 at Adelaide.]
