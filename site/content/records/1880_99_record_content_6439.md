2nd Leader on The Land Question.

There seem to be three classes of selectors:

‘Those who have even this year, and still less last year [no?] reason to complain of loss as the result of their toil.  [The context implies the negative despite the actual words printed.]

Those who have failed in obtaining a return for their labour because of the exceptionally bad season.

Those who are on areas where only an occasional crop can be expected, and who will never under such circumstances be likely to make wheat growing pay.

The first need no compensation

The second must be assisted for their own sakes and the sake of the state.

The third should only be helped to go elsewhere, where a better prospect awaits them.

The Chief Secretary’s proposals roughly meet these cases as above.
