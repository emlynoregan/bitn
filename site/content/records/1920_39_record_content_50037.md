Once the Town Council sold the Kooringa Courts it would have no control over them.  The whole desire behind the move was to play Sunday tennis.  Even todayâ€™s ministers seemed to take little notice of Sunday tennis unlike their old time ministers.  In his opinion they were lacking in their duties in not trying to stop it.
