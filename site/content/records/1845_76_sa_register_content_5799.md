Kooringa Political Meeting

On 3 March a crowd of almost all the adult male population of the townships gathered at the Burra Hotel when it was known that G.S. Kingston has arrived.  Mr Lang also attended and the chair was taken by Dr Bull.

W.R. Mortlock proposed Mr William Lang as a suitable candidate and Mr John Wiltshire seconded the motion.

William Paxton proposed G.S. Kingston and was seconded by H. Chambers.

When called upon Mr Lang expounded on his political views, which were most liberal.

Mr Kingston said he was not aware of any of his actions deserving their disapprobation and he alluded to a placard he had seen that referred to a ‘purse-proud Burra Director’.   He did not think he merited this insinuation and said his principles were rather similar to those of Mr Lang.

There was a rather stormy discussion between the ministers of religion who were present, relative to the Government grant in aid of religion, which both the candidates were utterly opposed to.

A show of hands indicated a large majority in favour of Mr Lang.

A committee has been established among the tradesmen of the township to secure the return of Mr Lang free of expense.  He has said he will not canvass a single voter or spend a shilling on his election.
