Rev. Donald Redding, to be instituted as Rector of St Mary’s on 28 September, has just returned from a visit to London where he was born 35 years ago.  He came to Australia on leaving school in 1914 and worked on farms in WA and NSW before joining the AIF, seeing service with the 15th LHFA in Egypt and Palestine.  On returning he entered St Barnabas College in Adelaide gaining a Licentiate’s Diploma of the Australian College of Theology.  He was ordained a deacon in 1921 and a priest in 1922.  He has been Curate of Christ Church Mt Gambier for three years.  On his visit to London he was presented with the Freedom of the City, of which City his father was a deputy alderman for many years.  On his return to Australia he has been in charge of parishes at Robe, Waikerie, Pt Adelaide and Henley Beach and from 1929 to Easter 1933 at Maitland.
