Agriculture: Co. Burra agriculture for 1876-77. 14,778 acres sown to wheat of which 10,404 acres were reaped with 3,577 cut as hay & rest lost. The yield was 52,092 bushels at av. 5 bushels per acre.

Cf. previous season 13,109 acres yielded 140,861 bushels at an av. 10 bushels 45 lb/ acre

Difference due to drought. Areas getting over 5 bushels should make a profit, though not a great one. Prices were up & a 7 bushel crop was as profitable as an 8.5 bushel one the previous season. The drought had hit pastoralists worse.
