Flower entries were down, but standards were maintained.

Needlework entries were well up with a good juvenile section, but the CWA section only had two entries.  The standard was very good.

School Displays were pleasing with entries from Burra High and Burra Primary Schools, Burra Kindergarten, Leighton, Farrell Flat, Mt Bryan and St Joseph’s Convent.

Art entries were down and the standard was not particularly high. Some sections were poorly represented.

Budgerigars were of a good standard and bantams a creditable display.

Poultry entries were not high, but included some nice birds.

The pigeon section was a big improvement on 1967.

The cooking standard was down.

Grain and fodder entries were good, but few.

Goats were of an exceptionally high standard.

Sheep entries were down, but quality was good.

Fruit and vegetable entries were few, but of good quality.

Flowers were good for late in the season, especially in pelargoniums, fuchsias, poppies, cinerarias, stocks and anemones.

Floral Art was good, with the flowers fresh and of excellent quality.

Horses-in-Action produced very high standard jumping.  Novelty events were keenly contested.

Wool entries were well grown with good character.
