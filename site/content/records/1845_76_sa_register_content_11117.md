Kooringa News

The Church of England Sunday School was to have had its annual treat on Friday 9 October, but inclement weather saw this deferred to Saturday 10 October.  The Bishop had just arrived from Adelaide and he and Rev. Ibbetson met the children in St Mary’s Church.  After the children had been examined by the Bishop they formed a procession through Kooringa and Aberdeen to the parsonage, where they were greeted by a hymn from the German Choristers.  A booth had been erected to accommodate 150 and tea was prepared for the children.  After that tea was served to the adults.  A general scramble for nuts and sweetmeats was then enjoyed by the children.  Bishop Short distributed prizes to the boys and Mrs Short to the girls.  The Bishop delivered an impressive address to the children and the German choristers concluded the event with a hymn.  There were 180 children and 100 adults present.

The Bishop and Rev. Ibbetson have just started on a missionary tour to the far north, making this the eighth tour by Rev. Ibbetson.

The mail cart arrived this afternoon (Friday 16 October) at the usual time, but instead of the mail from Adelaide it brought the mail sent from here yesterday morning.  It seems the blunder occurred at the Kapunda post office.  An express has been despatched this afternoon, so as to reach Kapunda with the mails before the time for starting in the morning.
