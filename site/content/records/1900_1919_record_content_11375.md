Burra Waterworks.  The Government authorities are engaged in flushing pipes and raising stopcocks â€“ some of which have been seen for the first time since they were installed.  Most are in better condition than expected.  An oil engine will, in future, do the work of the boilers and save the cost of fuel etc.
