Burra High School

Mr E.C. Allen MP asked the Minister of Education to report on the inspection of the site recently and to say when the new Burra High School would be commenced.  [He provided background information of the present situation with its 100-year-old building, shared site with the Primary School, temporary classrooms and crowding at the present site.

The Minister said the inspection confirmed the need for a new High School.  It was presently programmed to have the new school ready for the start of 1974 and an endeavour would be made to advance this date, but that would depend on Commonwealth funding.  The existing building would then be upgraded to meet the needs of the Primary School.
