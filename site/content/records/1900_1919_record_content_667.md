Obituary.  G.A. Gebhardt died on Friday [16 March].  He was born at Duderstadt, Hanover, Germany in 1833 and arrived in SA in the Ohio in 1858.  He proceeded to Burra and took up butchering before turning to pastoralism.  He bought Mt Cone from the Crown and leased Pualka [sic] soon after he improved it and subsequently sold it.  It is now known as part of the Paratoo Run.  He then purchased Markaranko Station, a lease on the Murray, which he held for 19 years.  He worked very hard improving his properties and fighting vermin and other odds, like bad seasons.  He added to Mt Cone by purchasing land from Mr Lewis in 1871 (Wildotta), where he built his residence of Mackerode.  On retiring he went to live in Glenelg.  At one time he had the best flock of Lincolns in the colony, but the run was later restocked with Merinos.  He recently acquired both Pareora and Corryton Park.  In 1875 he and his family took a twelve month trip to Germany.  He leaves a widow and seven children: Messrs Charles E., L.W., & A. Gebhardt of Mackerode and A.G. of Pareora (Pt Wakefield).  He also leaves two brothers and sisters.

He was, in retirement, a member of the Lutheran Church in Flinders St, Adelaide.

[Gustav Adolph Gebhardt died 16 March 1900 aged 66]
