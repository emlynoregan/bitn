R.J. Phillips writes in response to G. Barnard.  He thank the latter for raising the level of the debate and goes on to say that some of the trees being planted are inappropriate.  Eucalyptus spathulata for example tends to split and fall over, while Eucalyptus sideroxylon rosea, which has been planted along the bank behind the Council Chamber has not only obscured the archaeological value of the area, but will threaten the building when they reach their full height of over 100 ft.

[He goes on to list a number of other unsuitable imports from elsewhere in Australia and to suggest that species truly native to the area are being overlooked.]

He ends:

‘So – G. Barnard, I believe it does matter what sort of trees we plant, and how and where we plant them.  You may find ‘The vegetation of SA’ by R.L. Specht and ‘Native Trees of SA’ by C.D. Boomsma interesting reading.’
