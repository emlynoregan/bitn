W. Anderson, a candidate for West Ward, would also be for economy.

Mr Lane asked how they would handle the Waterworks accounts.

Mr Sampson they could be done by the Town Clerk and he be paid pro rata.

The Inspector’s work could be done in 3 days a week and they would get 50 offers to do so at £3 for what now cost £5.

Cr West wondered whether nuisances only occurred on 3 days a week.

The mayor did not give a report, as the requisition did not refer to the past.  He would do so at the annual meeting.

Mr Holder said there was no such thing as the annual meeting under the Act.

The Mayor said he supposed he would shortly call a meeting.

Mr Kitchen wondered if any Council worked on the lines proposed by Cr Sampson.

Cr Sampson thought about four, but couldn’t name them.

Cr West said that Cr Sampson was either under a great error or was wilfully false.  They had great difficulty last year, and had always found that Cr Sampson would try to get his own way by foul means if he could not by fair.

Mr Holder moved a vote of thanks to candidates and to the Mayor for presiding.

‘He was not altogether sorry that ratepayers had had such an opportunity of seeing the kind of wrangling that had taken place at nearly every meeting of the Council during the past year.’
