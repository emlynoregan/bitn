Cr Marston said the amendment was ridiculous.  It was telling a body that had spent hundreds of pounds on improvements that it had no control over what was virtually its own property and in any case where would they find their authority to order players off the courts?

Cr T.H. Woollacott said it was not permissible to play cricket on Victoria Park on Sundays and the same should apply to the Aberdeen Courts. The Adelaide City Council did not allow Sunday Sport in the Parklands.

Cr Marston said Cr Woollacott had been using that bluff for too long and it was time he stopped.  A minute in the Council books of about 1938 allowed the Cricket Club to play occasional games there on Sunday and the City Council did not stop sport in the parklands on Sundays, with the exception of Adelaide Oval.

The Clerk confirmed the existence of such a minute.

The Mayor then said there should be a By-Law against Sunday Sport and he wished someone would give a Notice of Motion accordingly later.

Cr Lee said there had been similar trouble over Sunday Sport at Victoria Park some time ago and it had been found they could not stop Sunday Sport providing no admission fees were charged, because the land belonged to the people of Burra.

Cr Baulderstone suggested that Cr Woollacott change the wording of his amendment to ‘ask players to refrain’.

Cr Woollacott refused.

The Mayor said he appreciated Cr Woollacott’s position, but felt in the absence of a By-Law he did not have the power to banish players from the courts.

The Clerk pointed out that since new By-Laws had been adopted in 1938 the Council could not prosecute unless there was a By-Law.  At the orders of the Mayor, he could tell players to get off the courts, but he would have no authority to do so.

Cr Woollacott then agreed to use the word ‘refrain’ in his amendment.

On being put the motion was carried with Crs Marston, Lee and Baulderstone supporting it and Crs T.H. & S.J. Woollacott opposed.

[The newspaper report does not report the fate of the amendment, so it is not clear whether the motion passed was as amended or as proposed by Cr. Marston.]
