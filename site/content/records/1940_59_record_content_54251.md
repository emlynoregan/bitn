Victoria Park

The Memorial Oval Committee is trying to make a playing oval that will be an asset to the town.  The scheme started in 1947.  The oval now looks like a football ground.  Couch grass and clover were planted last year.  The couch did not germinate, but the clover did, along with natural grasses.  In spring there was vigorous growth.  The Committee now believes the best way to generate interest in the project is to get the ground used for games.  The cricket clubs have been playing there and it is hoped the football club will decide to use it this season.  More work is to be done in the form of a grandstand, gates etc.  The park is to be a Memorial to Heroes of World War 1940-45 [sic.]

Mr Leo Hawkes as 1st President did much work to get the project started.  Jim Rowe, his successor, is keen to keep the project on the move.  H.J.B. Jennison, the present Chairman, is anxious and wiling to see headway maintained.  The property belongs to ratepayers and was originally a Memorial to Queen Victoria.  The aim is to foster good clean sport and provide a playing arena for today and for those to come.  People are asked not to condemn the endeavour without coming to see what has been achieved.  More help is needed and donations of time, money and materials are sought.
