1933

Staff was E.A. Haese Headmaster, Beryl Dunstan, Olive Prior and Mabel Dunstan.

B. Dunstan was transferred early in the year to be replaced by Marie Coghlan.  The enrolment was 52.

The school owned two typewriters.  On 7 June J. Gibbs addressed the school on the dried fruits industry.  On 6 September the school went to Balaklava for the combined sports using Hill’s bus, Thomas’s buckboard, Fuss’s lorry and Hutchinson’s and the Headmaster’s cars.  A mass meeting of parents was held to hear the report from a delegation to the Minister of Education concerning fees for High School students.  The school was divided into two ‘Houses’ for the first time.
