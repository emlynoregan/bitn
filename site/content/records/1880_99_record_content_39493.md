Characteristics of the 1890 Paper

The paper continued to be published twice a week: on Tuesday and Friday.

The paper began the year with F.W. Holder as proprietor, but apparently with W.H. Hardy as actual editor, writing the editorials and leading articles.  His distinctive style is evident in many articles as well as the leading one.

Page 1 continued to carry the larger ongoing advertisements, mainly local, but also some more widespread.

Page 2 carried notices, adverts for sales, classified advertisements and generally the sort of items that changed weekly like entertainment, church services and council notices.

The news came in a section almost unbroken by advertising.  There were regular reports on sport, both local and worldwide.  There were correspondents’ reports from other towns in SA and local news often in brief paragraphs under ‘Current Topics’.  Letters to the editor were fairly common, but court reports were neither complete nor common.  Hardy’s leading articles must have been out-of-step with the views of most readers and those who could cope with his rather purple prose must often have disagreed with his conclusions, but probably few bothered to read them.

Page 3 is where most of this news had to be, almost always pushed on by the editor’s efforts.

Page 4 carried poetry, short stories, essays and other non-news items.  The year began with the paper carrying a serial here, but apparently significant numbers of readers bought only the Friday edition and so this was replaced by complete works.  There were also advertisements, especially for patent medicines.

On 16 May P. Murrie became the proprietor and editor.  The style of the editorials changes, though it is not clear whether Murrie wrote the leading articles or merely supervised Hardy more carefully as they continue to be quite left wing.  The arguments seem to become rather more moderate and the prose more coherent.  Some of the other leading articles seem still to read like Hardy and there are several noms de plume that must be him.  He is certainly the ‘Erratic Correspondent’ and very likely ‘Ajax’ and possibly others as well.

The ‘Sparks’ column reappears with its very brief comments on the local scene.  These comments are often frustratingly cryptic with references to apparently interesting events that are not elsewhere reported, but in too brief or oblique a way to now be interpreted.
