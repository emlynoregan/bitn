Burra Train Service.  The Saturday trains have been restored after a long gap.  A midday train now arrives from Adelaide, with an afternoon service to Adelaide.  Continuance of the services would depend on patronage.

The Railways Commissioner said that owing to the difficulty in obtaining crews to handle heavy freight, it would not be possible to reinstate the Wednesday service.
