Burra Burra Show Inc. held its AGM on Thursday

Improvements of the ground are proposed, in preparation for the show’s centenary event.  [1977]

An appeal for $4,000 is being launched.  One aim is for new toilet facilities.  Elected were: Patron, Rex Warnes; President, Graham Kellock (re-elected); Vice-Presidents, Ron Shipard & Neil Hurst and Secretary, Darrell Field.

The President’s Report showed a successful year with above average attendance on a fine sunny day.  The Minister for Agriculture, Hon. T.M. Casey, opened the show.

Art was well supported, but photography was disappointing.

Cookery was well supported.

Needlework was strongly contested.

Produce entries were rather low.

Schoolwork made a good display.

Fresh fruit and vegetables section deserves better support from the home gardener.

Flowers and Floral Arts sections had a good display following a good season.

Birds were strongly supported with good displays.

Wool received many entries.

Sheep entries were again disappointing.

Goats had a good display.

Pigs drew only one exhibit and the cattle section was similar.

The dog display was only average.

The Motor Cycle Trials were a successful innovation.

Horses in Action were popular and entries were of a high standard.

The Shearing Competition was popular with spectators, but entries were down a little.

Miss Show Girl was revitalised this year.

Sideshows were well supplied.
