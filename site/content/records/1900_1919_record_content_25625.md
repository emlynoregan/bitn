Viceroy Tea Carnival

A great crowd assembled on Victoria Park on Saturday to witness the balloon ascent arranged by Messrs Wilkinson & Co. of Adelaide as a novel way of advertising their Viceroy Tea.  It created a big sensation.  The inflation of the balloon was watched with great interest.  At the report of a pistol shot, it was released and rose quickly some hundreds of feet, carrying with it Rinaldo, seated comfortably on a trapeze. At the climax he hung by his toes on the fast drifting balloon and then, hanging by his hands, he turned a complete somersault before taking his seat again.  The crowd cheered.  Another pistol shot was the signal for him to drop from the balloon and his body fell towards the earth rapidly, but suddenly a parachute opened and Rinaldo was seen seated on the trapeze, from which he saluted the crowd with a cheery wave of his hand.  Eventually he landed somewhat uncomfortably in P.L. Killicoatâ€™s woodheap at Abberton Park, sustaining a shaking and several cuts, but with his grit and determination undiminished.  W.J. Richardson brought Rinaldo back to Victoria Park in his motor car.
