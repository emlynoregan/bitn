Evan George, Independent Candidate for Burra spoke at the rotunda last Friday.  He had represented the electorate from 1930-33.  He had resigned from the ALP due to the pre-selection process, which had disenfranchised members of the Affiliated Unions.  He outlined his past actions, supported the Wheat Storage Bill and the Mortgagers Relief Act.  He opposed five-year Parliaments and supported the Morgan-Whyalla pipeline with benefits also for Burra, Jamestown, Pt Pirie, Peterborough & Pt Augusta.  He believed that as it was related to national defence the Commonwealth should bear half the cost.  He was for preferential fares and freights and for the abolition of High School fees.  He denied absolutely that he was financed by the Protestant Federation.
