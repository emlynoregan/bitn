Fire

An inquest was held on Saturday at the Pig & Whistle before Mr MacDermott SM into a fire that had broken out that morning on the premises of J.N. Bennett, consisting of a large shop, three dwelling houses and four cottages.  It was thought the fire originated in an old hay shed in the occupation of Mr T. Bath.  The fire spread very rapidly and in a short time the shop and attached houses, which were all built of wood, were utterly consumed, as were the roofs of two or three of the cottages.  Had it not been for timely assistance the fire might have spread much further and done considerably more damage.

The jury of respectable men was headed by Mr John Winnall.

William Lewis:

Was shaving when someone said there was a fire in the shed where Mr Bath kept hay.  First saw the fire in the southwest corner of the shed.  Mrs Richards gave him a bucket of water which he threw on the fire.  Mr Bath and others came and all worked hard to extinguish the blaze.  Some adjoining houses were partially unroofed to prevent the fire from spreading.  It took about 2Â½ hours to put the fire out.  The fire originated in a paling place containing hay and some salt.  Did not know the origin of the fire.  The shed was about 8 or 10 ft from the bakehouse at the back.

Albert Gibbs:

Saw the fire at about 8 a.m.  First thought it was a chimney on fire, but then saw flames coming through the palings.  Thought then it could have been put out with a few buckets of water, but not thinking clearly, he ran to give the alarm to the neighbours, telling them to get their money and children out.  Mr Bath came soon after.  The fire was in the front of the building opposite the schoolroom.  Besides the wooden buildings there were two houses burnt and one destroyed. He had heard nothing as to the origin of the fire and had no opinion himself.

Charles Oldenschlagel:

Was at work in his shop when he heard the alarm raised.  He rushed out and saw Mr Lewis with buckets of water, trying to extinguish the fire. Thought the fire must have started in the shed at the bottom, at the back right hand corner.  He had not heard complaints regarding ashes being thrown out, but believed Mrs Langenberger had made complaints.  Threw two or three buckets of water on the fire but smoke prevented his entering the shed.  Was about to pull down some palings when Dr Mayne forbade him.  Had never noticed sparks coming fro m the bakery chimney.

Bertha Langenberger:

Was in my kitchen baking some cakes when I saw the fire and took my pails of water to Mr Moore who threw them on the fire.  Mrs Moore did the same.  She had never complained of ashes being thrown there.

Thomas Bath:

At 8.30 came to his office and was soon afterwards informed of the fire.  Called for water and fetched some wet blankets.  When he returned the fire had already spread from the shed.  Though it likely the fire originated from ashes thrown out.   Neighbours generally threw ashes out near his shed.  There was a heap right against the palings.  The young man in his employ whose business was to go there did not smoke.  He rented the shed from Mr Bennett and his loss would be inconsiderable.  All the cottages, some of which were partially destroyed, had back doors and may have thrown ashes near the shed.  Had no doubt the fire originated at the back of the building near the ash heap.
