The Local Board of Health discussed the problem of non-delivery of milk.  Cr Marston said there was much to be said for the position of the milk producers.  He suggested that the Board recommend to the Primary Producers Assistance Board that the price in Burra be 5d delivered and 4d at the dairy.  The Mayor did not agree with the suggestion, but thought they should ask the Prices Commission to investigate the matter at once.

T.H. Woollacott said the matter was largely out of their hands.  A new milk vendor was talking of starting to supply milk here.  The price demanded by the vendors was too high, as milk could be landed in Burra at 1/8 a gallon.  [2Â½d a pint] In most parts of the state the price was 4d a pint and in Adelaide was delivered to the doorstep in sealed bottles for that.  He would like to see the settlement of the dispute through a meeting of the Burra producers and the Prices Commissioner.
