Burra School Visiting Day last Friday drew many parents to the school.  The new Progress Certificate came in for review.  To get one three things are considered:

A pass in an examination set by the headmaster in November each year.

The last two years’ scholastic record.

The teacher’s estimate including evaluation of speech, alertness, attitude and general ability.
