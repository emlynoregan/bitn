Obituary.  Mr Philip Oates died at his residence in Prospect 25 July aged 96.  He was a former resident of Burra, having come to SA in the David Malcolm in 1848; the same ship that brought the late William (Tailor) Pearce to Australia.  We believe he was the first farmer in the Ironmine district.  He was mentally alert to the end and quite well until the last year.  John Oates of Aberdeen and Edward Oates of Kooringa are sons.
