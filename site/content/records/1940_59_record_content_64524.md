Notice.  The Registrar General of Land Titles advises that he intends to grant title to Glen Roy Finch of Burra, grazier, by right of possession, unless a caveat is lodged within two months, with respect to Allotments 2, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, & 13 of block 2 of Section 78 in the Hundred of Kooringa, of which the registered proprietors are Samuel Mutton of Kooringa, Minister; Matthew Henry Furniss of Burra Mine, Accountant; William Phillips of Kooringa, Miner and Robert Mutton of Kooringa, Miner.

[Block 2 of Section 78 was subdivided in 1859, probably by Matthew Henry Furniss.  It was named Ashmore and was located west of Westbury and southwest of Copperhouse.  The trustees were, of course, all dead by 1954:

Samuel Mutton ?-?

Matthew Henry Furniss c. 1825-1895

William Phillips: there were three or four of this name in the Burra area about 1859.

Robert Mutton c. 1792-1873 or according to BISA c. 1808-1873 (well actually it says 1973!)

Ashmore failed to develop as a town, though a handful of poorer houses were erected.]
