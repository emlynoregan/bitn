Creeks are running strongly and on Tuesday morning last week the stream at Taylor Street ford was about 40 yards wide and at Young St Ford it was c. 4 ft deep.  A NSW panel van tried to cross here and was washed across the ford and trapped under the bridge.  The occupants escaped and the van was eventually recovered with the aid of the District Council tractors.  (A photograph appeared in Fridayâ€™s Advertiser, but was wrongly described as at Gum Creek.)
