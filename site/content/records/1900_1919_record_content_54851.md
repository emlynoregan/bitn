He reported on the impact of the war on the district – mainly with respect to volunteers for the front.

The season had been generally splendid, though somewhat varied due to the mice plague which affected both the sown seed and the bagged wheat awaiting transport.  Pastoral interests had a good year with a heavy lambing and good prices and feed is currently good with good prospects for the next season.  In fact everything was good except for an increase in the blow-fly problem.

Membership was stable.

The Sheep Show was cancelled due to heavy rainfall at the time it was scheduled and creeks made it impossible to move stock.

The Dog Trials were a great success.

The Show on 24 October was an unqualified success and gate money was up again.

The luncheon provided by the ladies was especially helpful in making the show a success.

They began and ended with a credit balance of £75.

Elected were

Patron		Hon. J. Lewis

President	I.J. Warnes

Vice-Presidents	T. McWaters & A.D. McDonald

Members’ tickets had been 10/6.  This was rescinded to allow for an increase to £1-1-0, but now to cover all functions of the society held throughout the year.  This change will be further discussed.
