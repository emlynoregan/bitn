A Blue Light Disco Committee has been formed.  This idea has been operating in SA since August 1983.  The movement aims to provide a disco-type entertainment for those under 18, free from drugs, alcohol and violence.  The disco is run by off-duty police officers assisted by volunteers.  The disco opens at 7.30 p.m.  Doors close at 9.00 p.m. and then no-one leaves until 11.15 p.m.  The disco closes at 11.30 p.m.  Burraâ€™s first Blue Light Disco will be on the Sunday of the October long weekend at the School Gymnasium as part of the Copper Festival.  Tickets $2 from the Burra Police Station from the end of this month.
