Littlejohn said, even if true it did not follow he had been drinking there and whenever he left the works, as his business compelled him to go anywhere and everywhere, he always shuts off steam and leaves the engine secure.

An argument over procedural matters followed.

Basically Crs Linkson & West objected to receiving written testimony since Littlejohn denied some of the content and would be unable to question the testee.

Littlejohn denied that the engine was working at the time he was using the crossing, because he had been reading a meter at the station (sometimes he goes through the fence and sometimes over the crossing) – there were other details and then the question: Will you swear now that you never left the engine while it was working?

On my oath I will swear I have not at any time left the engine while it was working.

Littlejohn swore he was not at the Bon Accord between 2 and 4 on 30 December.

Mr Morton swore he had not known Littlejohn to leave the engine running.

Mr Rule said the same: he said the engine was not running between 2 and 5 o’clock – steam was only got up after 5.

Crs Hardy and Kitchen then tried to have the written evidence received.  After argument Cr Hardy moved the Council adjourn so that Messrs Hunt and Preece could attend.

Meeting reconvened 20 February.

[This is printed as Jan. 23 and corrected by hand, in pencil, on the bound copy.]

Mr Hunt said that Littlejohn had once stated he had only left the works on two occasions to go to the Bon Accord for tobacco and matches – he could not say of anyone was in charge or not – told this in January – couldn’t be sure of the date – he understood Littlejohn to have meant while the engine was in motion.

Mr Preece said the day he went to the station he had met Mr Littlejohn coming from the crossing – he could not give a date.

Cr Parks moved that the Council take no further action in the matter in reference to the statements made by Councillor Kitchen against the engineer.  Cr Kitchen 2nd.

Crs Hardy, Kitchen and Parks for.

Crs Walsh, West, and Linkson against.

The Mayor cast his vote for

Cr Linkson moved that the evidence brought before this Council does not substantiate the charges laid against the engineer.  Cr Walsh 2nd.

For, Crs Linkson, Walsh and West.

Against, Crs Parks Kitchen and Hardy.

The Mayor cast his vote against.

[The Mayor thus voted that no further action be taken, but would not agree that the charges were unsubstantiated, which seems a somewhat odd position to adopt.]
