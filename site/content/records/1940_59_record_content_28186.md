Mrs Klaffus celebrates her 100th birthday.

Mrs Klaffus of Burra was born at Hahndorf on 27 August 1846.  Despite her great age she lives alone and mainly attends to her needs.  She has a keen wit and sense of humour.  She reared a large family from two marriages and helped to clear the land.  When young she could wield an axe with most men and at one stage cut six wagonloads of wood in one week.  To celebrate her birthday she was visited by the Mayor (Mr H.J.B. Jennison) and Mrs Jennison, Cr Carpenter and a number of citizens.  The Mayor said it was the first time he had attended a 100th birthday party.  She lives alone, does most of her own housework and cuts her own wood.  One staunch friend Mrs E. Wohling, visited her daily.  There was a sumptuous afternoon tea provided by Mrs Wohling and Mrs Klaffus cut the beautifully decorated cake and related some of the more humorous incidents of her long life.
