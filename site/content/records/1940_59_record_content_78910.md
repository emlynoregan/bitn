Burra Burra Hospital, Annual Meeting last Tuesday.

Improvements for the year have seen the kitchen modernised, renovations in the staff quarters, installation of a central hot water system and the purchase of a new resuscitator.  The water system is a circulating type allowing instantaneous hot water everywhere without any run-off.  A Women’s Hospital Auxiliary was inaugurated under the Presidency of Mrs Herb. Riggs.  The hot water system cost £4,078, half of which comes from a Government subsidy.  The resuscitator was made possible by a donation from the Mosey family of £50 to perpetuate the memory of Sister Mosey, who joined the AIF in 1914-18 and was at one time a Sister in this hospital.  The total cost is c. £130 and it will be subsidised.  A sale of unwanted goods in the year raised over £400.

A shortage of trained staff remains a worry and the hospital is grateful for the assistance of those in the district with nursing experience.  We were lucky to have Sister Pearse and Sister Greenhalg for over six months.  Sister Betty Ford is now Acting Matron.

Report of Dr Pitcher.

Dr Pitcher was glad to report a more stable staff this year.  402 patients were admitted, 142 operations were performed and 63 babies were born.  There was an average of 14 patients per day.  There is a pressing need for an ambulance in the district – although this is not the responsibility of the Hospital Board.  Thanks go to Mesdames Odgers, O’Sullivan, Young and others who have helped in times of staff shortages.
