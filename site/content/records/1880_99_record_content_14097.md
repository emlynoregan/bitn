The argument of the deputation on the Burra-Silverton route is reported in just over 1 column.  Their argument was that the Burra route took the railway through developed wool country with sheep stations on both sides, and the eastern lands were being opened to settlement.  Adelaide was the obvious and growing port for both the wool and Barrier traffic.  Broad gauge or a dual gauge line would suit intercolonial trade.  The Burra Hills were a minor obstacle and after that it was all flat and water was available.  To the north there were hills at Hallett and Gumbowie.  The Terowie delegation had proved the Barrier trade needed to be connected to the city and the port and this ruled out a route via Petersburg, but Burra was an even better choice in this regard.  The Commissioner disputed the distances they cited, but in any case was clearly more attracted to the shorter narrow gauge connection to Petersburg over 152 miles compared with their broad gauge of 182 miles.  He said broad gauge would cost an extra Â£500 per mile.  He also believed his preferred route passed through more productive country.
