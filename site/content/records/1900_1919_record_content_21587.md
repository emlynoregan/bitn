Terowie Races, also on 18 March, were very successful and the report runs for over 2⅔ columns. There was a sensation in the Handicap Jumpers’ Flat over 1½ miles when it was found that two of the horses had been doped.  Someone apparently got to the feed of J.C. O’Dea’s horses, Donnybrook & Imagination.  After the race Donnybrook collapsed and Imagination, who came 2nd, was frothing at the mouth and looked bad.  The veterinarian surgeon Bickford was telegraphed for and the horses have been saved.
