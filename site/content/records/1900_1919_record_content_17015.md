The Booborowie Methodist Church supper in connection with the thanksgiving services developed into a disgraceful fracas last Wednesday.  The supper was eaten and the public meeting that followed was concluded when the unsuitable behaviour of one male present towards one of the ladies stirred up old conflicts and a disgraceful brawl followed involving as well ‘Billingsgate Galore’.

[The report is flowery and indirect and names no names, but about ¾ column in all is devoted to what was clearly an amazing conclusion to a church function.]
