Redruth Court, Monday.

Three landowners were charged with not destroying rabbits.

J.A. Riggs 1/- + £2-2-0 costs.

P. Nankivell 1/- + £1-1-0 costs (Nankivell had pleaded guilty.)

[The fines were £5 reduced to 1/-, presumably on a first offence basis, but the 1/- suggests that the JPs thought the law absurd, which on the facts outlined would seem to be the case.]
