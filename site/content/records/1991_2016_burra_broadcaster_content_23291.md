Burra’s Senior Citizens have won a grant of $1,000 for their gardening group to install a watering system, the building of a low bluestone wall around the display garden and perhaps the purchase of a bench for the area.  They have been working on the garden for 13 years now.  The grant comes from the 2000 Community Gardens Grants run by Australia’s Open Garden Scheme and ABC Radio.
