Koonoona Stud celebrates its centenary with its annual Field Day on Thursday. It was founded by Hon. Walter Duffield and Mr T.S. Porter with 50 selected ewes from ‘Hill River’ and rams from Mount Crawford.  It remained in the same ownership till 1875 when Mr Porter retired and was replaced by Col. F. Makin.  When Mr Duffield died in 1880 the trustees of the estate administered the property till 1918, when it was sold to the beneficiaries and the then manager, Mr W.G .Hawkes.  The name was changed then to Koonoona Proprietors.  Mr Hawkes retired in 1930 and his son, Mr Glen Hawkes, acquired an interest as Managing Director, which position he held till his death in 1961.  The present Managing Director is Mr R.K. Pearse, who first came to Koonoona in 1938 as a jackeroo and returned as manager in 1952.  The present overseer is Mr R. Osborne.  The first Field Day (then called an Inspection Day) was held in 1946.  Koonoona was the first SA stud to fly rams to the Sydney Sheep Show and the first SA stud to sell a ram in Sydney for 1,000 guineas.  Since 1910 it has been a closed stud, producing a particularly even type of sheep that have proved their worth in all states and New Zealand with a reputation for heavy wool cutting ability.  It comprises 22,600 acres and presently carries 16,000 sheep.
