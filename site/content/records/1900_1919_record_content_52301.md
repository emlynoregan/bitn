Mr Davey: Board members had told him there was no hope of a reconciliation.  When put to Dr Ashton he had said that because the Board had backed the nursing staff he would decline to enter the institution whilst the present Board controlled it.

A letter in the paper had said there was nothing to prevent either doctor practising at the hospital.  It was strange that in the past month there had been one week when it was without any medical man at all.  It was time the Chief Secretary took the matter in hand.  The Board had to retire or be told by the Government to go.  Ratepayers should see proper men were nominated and they should not allow the present Board to renominate themselves.

J.G. Sara moved a lengthy amendment asking the Chief Secretary to take such steps as he may deem necessary to get the hospital functioning properly.

H.H. Thomas 2nd and spoke in support and favoured leaving the resolution with the Chief Secretary.  He did not believe either party had been guilty of any serious misdemeanour.  The whole thing was trumpery and above all needed speedy resolution.

Cr Radford said the whole thing was a disgrace to someone.  He supported the amendment, believing the original motion went too far.  He believed the whole thing went back years.  They had heard Dr Ashton’s defence, but there were always two sides.  He thought the Board had some right to an enquiry.  The old practice of the Board had run up expenses and the Chief Secretary had called for economy. And this had caused trouble in cutting expenses.  The matter wanted thorough sifting.  The Board had taken a stand which reacted on the members.

Mr P. Roach asked: ‘Why did the Board dispense with Dr Ashton’s services?’

Mr Crewes said he privately had no objection to telling ratepayers the reason.

If ratepayers subscribed £1,000 p.a. they could elect their own Board.

Mrs Ashton said Dr Ashton had never been given a reason for his dismissal.

Mr Lawn asked Mr Davey if anyone had been refused admission since the trouble began.

Mr Davey believed not, but a number would not seek it.

The Mayor explained that under present arrangements the Board was appointed by the Government and on the expiry of their term they signified to the Chief Secretary if they were willing to continue and were appointed as a matter of course.  He did not know who sent along nominations when a vacancy occurred.

The amendment was lost with only eight supporting it and the motion carried overwhelmingly.

T.H. Woollacott asked if it were true the military authorities had cabled for Dr Steele’s return.  Mr Crewes said he didn’t know.  A delegation was elected to take the decision to the Chief Secretary.
