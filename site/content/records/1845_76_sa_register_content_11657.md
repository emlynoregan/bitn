Henry Ayers Secretary of the SA Mining Association writes to the Editor in response to the suggestion that the Directors should induce residents to improve the appearance of Kooringa:

The leases are granted on generous terms for 21 years at the nominal rent of from £1 to £5 per half acre for town lands.  Persons applying for extensions to leases have always been liberally treated.  From time to time the Company has spent large sums of money on improving Kooringa, including cleaning the streets, but it can scarcely be expected that a company that laid out the township some 12 or 13 years ago, should be expected to continue to make bridges, repair streets, and act as scavenger.

‘It is time that the inhabitants made some effort to remedy what I most willingly admit to be a very serious evil.’

[The editor urges the residents to at once petition the Government for the extension of the Corporation Act to the town.]
