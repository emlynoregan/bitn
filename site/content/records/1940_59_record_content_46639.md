Wilcannia & Points North, Part 1

Wongalilli Station NSW

[There is a lengthy article on this station and a series is carried on weekly until 5 September.]

Twenty years ago Lou Billings was manager of Oakvale Station, when he was granted Wongalilli Station – then unimproved except for one bore.  Recently (1950) Mr Billings bought Glen Bower Station near Burra and Wongalilli now runs under the management of Frank Heinrich, formerly of Burra.  Some four weeks ago a party of Burra people heard that Wongalilli was a sportsman’s paradise and decided on a trip to see.  This series of articles resulted.  Three cars took Mr & Mrs L. Hawke & son, Mr & Mrs J. Hill, Mr & Mrs B. Nicholls and Mr & Mrs F.T. Marston.  Encounters with kangaroos, wild ducks and wild pigs were expected.  The route was first to Broken Hill and thence to Wilcannia before heading 43 miles north to Reg. Nevan’s holding ‘Ulaili,’ on  the Paroo.
