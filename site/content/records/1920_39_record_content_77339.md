Mongolata Goldfield

Baldina Mongolata GM Syndicate for fortnight to 2 December.

Leane’s Adit.  At 70ft level continued the main drive to 16ft, driving south on a 3” leader showing no values by pan test.  Three days prospecting on Farnden’s Hill brought no results.

Will now begin working at the 90 & 100ft levels.
