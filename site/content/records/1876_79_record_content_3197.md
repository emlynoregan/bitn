A group of seven waited on the Commissioner of Public Works to refute the need for an undercrossing near the Bon Accord Hotel.

The Mayor thought he had given adequate notice for the water supply meeting and considered that the whole question should be brought to the notice of the Commissioner of Public Works as it affected the whole town, not just part of it. Cr Roberts moved that the question of a water supply for the whole town be a matter of concern to the Government with representations made from the Members for the District. Carried.

The Mayor and other councillors will attend the Commissioner when he visits shortly.
