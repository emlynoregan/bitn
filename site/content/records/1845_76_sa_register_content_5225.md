Public Meeting at Kooringa on the New Constitution

The appointed day for the meeting to discuss the new constitution at Kooringa was Monday 11 November.  In honour of the occasion flags fluttered over the principal stores and larger shops, some of which were decorated with evergreens; especially the emporium of Marks and Gollin.  Business seemed to continue unabated and the Mine and Smelting Works were operating as usual.

At 3 p.m. crowds assembled at the Burra Hotel until it was ‘necessary to adjourn to the pile of buildings recently added to that extensive structure, and known as the “Oddfellows’ Hall and Kooringa Assembly-room,” a splendid apartment (the second in the colony), fifty-eight feet long, thirty-one feet wide, and eighteen feet high, lighted from each side and one end by well-proportioned windows.  There were upwards of two hundred persons present.’

[This seems to be the first report that clearly identifies the Oddfellows’ Lodge Hall.]

W. Lang, the Resident Magistrate took the chair pro tem.

He had called the meeting in response to a requisition for a meeting to discuss getting adequate representation for the towns of the Burra Burra Mines in the reformed Legislative Council and to consider whether the time had come for forming those townships into an Incorporated Borough of Kooringa.

Mr Lang introduced the reasons for the meeting and was then voted into the chair.

Rev. Cheetham proposed: ‘That this meeting congratulates their fellow colonists on the prospect of the arrival of the new constitution as the advent of Representative Government.’

He gave a lengthy speech on the virtues of representative government and believed it would prove a much more economical form of government.  It was also desirable on the ground of equality and liberty, both civil and religious.

Mr E. Fitzgerald seconded and made a few remarks.  Carried unanimously.

Mr Fitzgerald then moved: ‘This meeting is of the opinion, in order to secure the full benefit to arise from the new Legislative Council, that the franchise should be enjoyed by every freeholder and leaseholder, and by all persons occupying premises of the annual value of £5 and upwards.’  Seconded by Mr Godfrey.

Mr Fitzgerald had argued the importance of a proper number of representatives, so that their community should have full weight in the Council.  It was also important that those representatives should understand their wants and fairly express their wishes.

‘The resolution did not go to the length of demanding universal suffrage, but it approached it as nearly as possible, consistent with the necessary precautions to keep in check the mere outcasts, the wandering vagabonds of society, whose habitual tendencies would prompt them to injure rather than serve the public they preyed upon.’

He considered that a £5 franchise would place political rights in the hand of every industrious man and would not disqualify any honest or virtuous male adult.

Mr Burgess craved the attention of the meeting that he might remind them that the effect of the resolution must be to disqualify fully two-thirds of the inhabitants of Kooringa.  One half of the young men present at the meeting would be disqualified by it.  It would disqualify the respected son of their much esteemed chairman.

The Chairman said: ‘Serve him right.  He should qualify.’  (Roars of laughter.)

Mr Burgess asked whether the inhabitants of the creek would be more honest, industrious, thrifty and intelligent if they were translated from their humble habitations to the best houses in the town.

He might not entertain views in accordance with the majority, but nevertheless he would move an amendment in favour of universal suffrage.  He also pointed out that a number of men resided by agreement in substantial houses owned by the Copper Company and occupied without a lease and without the payment of rent.  They would be disqualified under the £5 criterion.

Mr Lang reminded then that the original wording was that the occupied premises had merely to be worth £5 annually.  Mr Burgess pointed out that the valuation would be difficult to establish as there was no assessment in the town.  In any case he believed universal suffrage was the inherent right of the race.

He therefore moved his amendment: ‘That all residents in the borough 21 years of age and untainted with crime should enjoy the franchise.’

Mr Budd admitted that at home [i.e. in the UK] he was a Chartist, but that was very different from being a Red Republican.  He supported Rev. Burgess’ remarks.  All had the right to the franchise whether they were without a sixpence in their pockets, or the opulent lords of broad acres.  He seconded the amendment.

Rev. Pollitt spoke in favour of an educational test for the franchise.  He doubted the wisdom of giving the vote to those who were illiterate, who neglected the education of their children, and who were ‘regardless of their character here or their fate hereafter’.

‘He was certain that no honest and industrious man need be six months in the colony until he could qualify under the resolution.’

Mr Pearce addressed questions to the last speaker through the chair.

Could more than two-thirds of the population of the Burra townships read and write?  And if not should the remainder be disenfranchised?  Would occupants of houses of annual value of £5 be disenfranchised if they could not read and write?

Mr Pearce said there were many intelligent young men living in Kooringa who chose to live in lodgings as best suiting their needs at the present.  He suggested it was unjust to disenfranchise a young man who might be saving money for a marriage or whose wife had not yet followed him to his new place of employment.

Mr Pearce supported universal suffrage as in the amendment.

Rev. Cheetham also supported the amendment for similar reasons.
