Burra High School Speech Night.

[This report is badly mangled in the paper, with bits and pieces scattered through parts of four pages, but not in the right order; sometimes not even in the right order within a given page.  I have assumed the right order to be:

Page 1

Page 5, bottom half of column 5 (Summary of year’s work)

Page 4, column 1 to bottom of column 4

Page 8, columns 3 & 4

Page 5, top part of column 4.]

The speech night was held in the Burra Town Hall 18 December.  Mr P.H .Quirke MP was the guest speaker and was accompanied by Mrs Quirke.  He gave a forceful talk on the stages of education for life.

Headmaster Mr Jeffery’s Report: the 45th Annual Report for Burra High School

The school began the year with an enrolment of 75.  No staff changes occurred during the year.  Of eleven candidates who sat for the Intermediate, ten gained full certificates and the other enough to add to in the future.  Ten credits were obtained.  In Leaving (after Supplementary Examinations) three certificates were gained out of a possible six.

[The report then cites the outstanding Intermediate results as:

Jeremy Cookes 	7 subjects with 1 credit

Richard Freer 	7 with 1 credit.

Robert Lott passed 	7 with 1 credit

Margaret Hopkins 	7 with 1 credit

Marcia Terry	7 with 1 credit

Jill Lucas	6 with 1 credit]

BUT this does not agree with the results printed early in 1956 in 87, 4, 31 Jan. 1956, page 6:

Robert P. Bourman	8 (3)

Jeremy E. Cookes	9 (1)

Richard G. Freer	8 (1)
