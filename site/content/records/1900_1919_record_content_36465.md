Burra Institute.  On Friday 12 December Theatregraph Pictures will present Quo Vadis, the 8,000’ film (2½hours) as run at West’s in Adelaide for five weeks.

The Committee met on Monday.  It recommended shelving all around the new library, the same height as the present shelving and that the old library be used as a cloakroom.  The latter decision was deferred.  168 chairs are being obtained for the hall.  To make seven rows of 12 chairs each side of the aisle.  The chairs will be bracketed into sets of three.  C.J. Pearce will do the battening.  Chairs will be oiled and varnished.

It was resolved to get some protection for the lantern at the picture show.  At present people crowd around it and it would be surprising if an accident did not eventuate.

Messrs Fuss, Harcus and the President (S.M. Lane) will arrange for a stand.

Subscribers number 130.

Some cracks in the Council Chamber ceiling will be examined.

Seven boys and seven girls from Burra State School will be given free subscriptions.
