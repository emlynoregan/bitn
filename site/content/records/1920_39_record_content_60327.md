Samuel Baker is believed to be the oldest surviving man born in SA.  He is in fairly good health physically and mentally and has his hearing and sight intact.  He came to live in Burra in the early 1850s.  He was born 17 March 1840 near where Holy Trinity Church now stands on North Terrace, Adelaide.  He was the son of James and Hannah Baker who arrived in SA by the Buffalo in 1836.  His parents lived first on North Terrace Adelaide and later moved to East Terrace.  His father started a business in Hindley Street as a butcher.  Mr Baker remembers the opening of the first bank in Adelaide on North Terrace.  His parents took him to the occasion in 1845.  It created much excitement among the Aborigines who were all around them at the time, brandishing their spears.  As a young lad he played on the banks of the River Torrens with native children and with Harry Wilkins, the father of Sir Hubert Wilkins.  He was fascinated by the way the Aborigines speared fish.  He was baptised at Holy Trinity and remembers attending divine service there with his parents.  With his boy pals he saw the arrival of the early Governors, Sir Henry and Lady Young, when they arrived by coach from Port Adelaide.  ‘Black Thursday’ was another memory, when he saw men and women kneeling in prayer in the streets, fearing the end of the world.  Birds flew into houses seeking refuge and other fell dead from the trees.  He witnessed the first arrival of a consignment of gold from Victoria under Capt. H. Tolmer.  He and Harry Wilkins walked to Glenelg to see The Old Gum Tree, where the colony was proclaimed and also to the old Cremorne Public House on Unley Road to watch the elephant there, which they used to help feed.  This place was an old time zoo and of great interest to the lads.  When quite a youth he left Adelaide and came to Burra, but returned to see the celebrations for the 21st anniversary of the colony in 1857.  On returning to Burra while in his teens, he worked for the late Joseph Ford and later at the Burra Mines.  He also worked for the late David James of Kapunda and William Hanford (known as Sydney Bill). He also carted on the roads in the early days, travelling from Burra to Pt Adelaide and back.  When the Victorian gold rush was on he went there, but failed to make his fortune and returned.  In 1887 he went into business with his son-in-law, the late J.V. Lord at ‘The Pinnacles’ near Broken Hill, but kept his home at Redruth.  Mr Baker was one of the first members of the Burra Show Society.  He was an enthusiastic gardener and for many years staged wonderful displays of flowers, fruit and vegetables and he still takes an interest in his garden, being seen only a week ago raking over a bed newly planted, his tall figure bent over, keenly intent on his job.  Breeding game birds was another hobby and he still possesses some prize birds of which he is very proud.  He has been a member of the Redruth Methodist Church for over 60 years and attends service whenever health and weather permit.  He enjoys chatting about the early pioneering days.  He married Miss Ann Edwards, who arrived in SA with her parents in the Richardson in 1848.  Her father came out to take charge of the refinery for the Burra Smelting Co.  Rev. Thomas Lloyd conducted the ceremony at Kooringa in 1862.  The couple enjoyed 73 years of happy married life before Mrs Baker died 8 August 1935 aged 94 years 7 months.  They reared 13 children of whom 11 survive:
