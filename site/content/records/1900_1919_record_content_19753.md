Letters to the editor re the libel case with J.S. Pryor are printed.

‘Sympathy’ extends sympathy ‘in your recent trouble’. 

‘We hope that you may long be spared to vindicate right and expose wrong wherever you may find it for the good of the public.’

‘Cousin Jack from Moonta’ [in dialect] writes to say he “ ’ope that your friends will come forward and pay the bill for ’ee.  I do see by your paaper that you have ‘ad over £25 sent ’ee, and I do feel purty pleased at this ’ere, because it is better than tributing with a surly old boss to meddle with ’ee, and try to clip your wings and run up costs.’

‘Justice’ considers the editor ‘a MARTYR to the CAUSE of TRUTH.’ And trusts the day will come when ‘TRUTH and STRAIGHTFORWARDNESS obtain the mastery over hypocrisy, vice and unscrupulous dealing however thickly such undesirable attributes may be covered over by deceit.’

[A donation was enclosed.]

‘Creek Ore’ writes with a small donation and would have sent more if he had ‘any valuable assets, such as was lately said to be found in the Burra Creek (vdie [sic] last balance-sheet of the B.B.C. Co.)’

‘Shareholder’ writes thanking the editor for his stand.  ‘Your references to the property have not been shaked in the least notwithstanding last week’s paper’.  He encloses an amount collected since the last issue.
