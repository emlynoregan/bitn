Obituary.  Mrs John Sampson of Burra North died last Sunday at Burra Hospital aged 92.  She was the second wife of the late John Sampson of Bridge Street, Kooringa.  She was born at Brandford in England 19 July 1849 and came to Australia on the Ashmoore, arriving on 26 September 1883.  She was married on 17 January 1885 at Kooringa to Mr Sampson, who had a grown up family.  After her husbandâ€™s death many years ago, she sold the old home and went to live at Redruth, where she lived alone, enjoying good health until the last year or so.

[Although the death is registered as Elizabeth Sampson who died 21 September 1941 at Burra, the marriage to John Sampson in Kooringa on 17 January 1885 gives her maiden name as Eliza Francis.  He gave his age then as 53 and she said she was 30, but if the age at death is correct, she was about 35.]
