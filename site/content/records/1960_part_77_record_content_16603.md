Rev. Father Laurence Joseph Quinn aged 31 was ordained on Saturday at St Joseph’s in Burra by the Bishop of Pt Pirie, the Most Rev. Dr Bryan Gallagher.  It is the first ordination in Burra after 81 years of St Joseph’s existence.  About 250 attended the two hour service at 9.30 a.m. and 140 attended a reception afterwards in the RSL Hall. Father Quinn is the second son of Mr & Mrs J.T. Quinn of Mt Bryan.  On Sunday Fr Quinn offered his first Mass and Benediction to a congregation of about 320 members of the parish.  Before entering the seminary six and a half years ago Father Quinn studied Latin to matriculation standard in one year (instead of the usual four).  He was tutored in this by Fr Hughes.
