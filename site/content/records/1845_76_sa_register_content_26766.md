Political Meeting at Kooringa

About 100 people attended a meeting at the Institute on Thursday night to consider the present political situation.

I. Killicoat JP presided.  He said he believed the Government was go-ahead and was acting in the best interests of the colony.  He referred to the proposal to extend various railway lines to open up the country and provide facilities for settlers.  He acknowledged that this would require more revenue.  The Government had proposed stamp, legacy and succession duties, which had passed the House of Assembly, but been blocked in the Legislative Council.  The Government felt that this was a vital part of their policy and had asked for a response from the electors.

Dr Stephens proposed that the meeting supports the policy proposed by the Government for the construction of railways and other reproductive work.  He spoke of his recent visit to the USA where the spread of railways was essential in the development of the country and its resources.  [His argument is reported at length.]

Thomas drew seconded and Mr Owen Harvey spoke in support.  He supported the bold move to borrow £3 million to build 500 or 600 miles of railway.  He had originally signed a petition against the Stamps Duties Bill without due consideration and now supported the Government’s proposals.

Captain Sanders thought that if the policy had a fault, it was in not being bold enough.  He was confident that the railways would open up agricultural land and bring rich mineral resources into production.  The cost of borrowing £3 million would be only 12/- per head of the population and was an investment about which future generations would rejoice.

W.R. Ridgway also endorsed the policy and the proposal was carried without dissent.
