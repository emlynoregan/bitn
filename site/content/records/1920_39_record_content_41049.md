Burra Burra Show Inc.  Committee meeting.  On the year’s transactions the society was £5 to the good.  There had been consideration of running a flower and poultry show in conjunction with the dog trials and the Produce Committee recommended this with the program modelled on the Yorketown Society with some alterations as suggested by Mr R. Fuss.  The report was adopted after discussion.
