[*This assertion is something of an exaggeration.  Robert Woollacott may have been the first to die in France (on 28 September 1915), but in Gallipoli and the Middle East earlier deaths were: A.E. Egan 25 April 1915, H.W. Skinner 2 May 1915, J. Camp 15 May 1915, C.A. Kuchenmeister 5 September 1915 and P.D. Killicoat 19 September 1915.]
