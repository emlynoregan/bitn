Burra Town Council, 5 February

Provision has been made for the public to use the telephone at the station.

The Railway Commissioner has agreed to a cab stand parallel to the station verandah, but not at the south end of the building.

Dr Ashton has applied for kerbing to be removed at the rear of his premises to allow him to build an entrance for a motor.

The Mayor reported the failure of a picture show for the Save the Children Fund on 1 February.  There had been no publicity and when only two or three people turned up the evening had to be abandoned.

Cr Kellaway resigned as Council representative on the Hospital Board as he was unable to attend meetings.  Cr Riggs was appointed in his place.

Councillors for each ward are to report next meeting on where they require street lights to be placed.

Cr Hammond was welcomed.
