Accident.  On 25 March in the early hours there was a two-car accident at the junction of Rymill & Jaffrey Streets, Burra.  There were no injuries, but substantial damage to vehicles.  It was caused by one vehicle travelling carelessly through thick dust.  [Rymill & Jaffrey Streets do not intersect: perhaps Rymill & Peacock Streets â€“ unless that section of Peacock St has been renamed.]
