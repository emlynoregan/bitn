Church of England Day School break-up was held on 18 December.  This school was fortunate in escaping the impact of whooping cough that was so prevalent this year.  This school has had a very successful year.  The prize list is printed and the Rector’s speech is reported at length.  Financially times were very hard and they had been compelled to find a teacher for the lowest salary.  There had been 19 applicants and it had been decided to give Miss Orr the chance to stay on.  There were two conditions attached.  On the first and third Sundays in the month pupils were expected to attend Divine Worship in charge of their teacher, when a brief children’s service would be held.  Secondly if she left the premises at lunch time she had to take the children with her.  (That is those who took their lunches to school.)  A program of entertainment followed the Rector’s address before the Mayor distributed prizes etc.
