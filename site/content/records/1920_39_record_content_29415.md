Church of England Day School

The first break-up day drew a large attendance to see the work done and to hear the report of progress made.  The Rector reported good progress.  The school was inspected and met with approval.  The yard is to be smoothed: at the present being very rough for play.  Secretary Mr J.F. Stephen read the report for Miss Orr.  School began 1 February when 17 children were enrolled.  The number is now 24.  Desks were obtained like those used in Government schools.  The Bishop visited on 14 May during the holidays, but most pupils came along anyway.  The school put on the operetta Snow White in the second term.  Mid-year exams were very successful.  At the final promotion exam only 3 or 4 pupils with very broken schooling were not promoted.  Numbers next year are expected to be 26.  A pleasant program was rendered.  Prizes were distributed and then Father Christmas came and a Christmas tree was revealed on the stage.  Gifts were distributed.
