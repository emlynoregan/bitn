Kooringa Methodist Sunday School held its annual picnic last Saturday at Stone Chimney Creek on property lent by Mr Herbert Morgan.  The weather, though fine was very boisterous.  The large marquee gave a degree of comfort despite the occasional whirls of dust and myriads of flies.  Sports were conducted in the afternoon when it eased somewhat.
