Inquest into Lasscock’s Fire, 20 April 1900.  E.W. Crewes, coroner and W. Davey, foreman of the jury.

Lascock:

Closed the shop at 6 p.m. – went to Mr Page’s till 8 p.m. – don’t smoke and know of nothing to cause the fire.  From 8 p.m. was at the Commercial Hotel – was told of the fire about 10.30 p.m.  Was carrying about £255 worth of stock for the Federal boot Co.  Know of no one threatening me and was giving up the agency of my own free will.  Had the key with me.  Lost my working tools and books.  Valued the former at £30, though they would cost more to replace.  Kitson repairs boots and left the place before I did.  He smokes.  Stocktaking was due, but was delayed at the request of Mr Bradley for the Boot Co.  I always settled with the company at stocktaking

Charles Bradley.

Took stock on 21 November 1899 and called again last Wednesday, 18 April.  Didn’t think there would be a deficiency of more than c. £20.  The value of stock would have been £266-17-3 less £10-1-6 I received since.

Kitson.

Left the shop at 4.30 p.m.  Was opposite about 10.05, but saw no fire then.

Two employees of the Commercial Hotel saw the fire and raised the alarm.

The verdict was that the origin of the fire was unknown.
