Letter from W.H. Hardy calling on the Mayor and Crs Tiver and Anderson to resign and urging a public petition to urge the same.  Following the deputation of ratepayers from the recent meeting the Mayor promised that the council would consider the request made by ratepayers, but though Cr Sampson asked them to do so before opening applications they ignored the deputation and tried to settle the matter of the Inspectorship without referring to the ratepayers’ request.
