The Children’s Jubilee Exhibition Excursion will involve about 200 teachers and other adults and 500 children.  No children under the age of 7 will be allowed on any account, including babes in arms.  The detailed instructions provide for two adults to every eight children in a compartment.  Children’s names will be recorded on a card to be given to the headmaster at the Riverton stop.  The train will run right into the Exhibition Grounds - arriving at 10.00 a.m.  The extra adults will not be required to keep with the children, but must re-enter the train in the Exhibition Grounds.  At noon on the lawns the children will receive a paper-bag containing a roll, a saveloy, a bun, an orange, and will get a cup of tea.  Adults are to make their own arrangements.  The children will assemble again before 4 and be addressed by the Mayor of Adelaide and the district MP before boarding the train, which must leave at 4.25 to arrive at 8.30.  The train must not be late or it will have to run behind the regular train, which would delay it till 10.00.  Parents should provide all children with food to eat on the journey in both directions and warm wraps for chill air at either end of the day.
