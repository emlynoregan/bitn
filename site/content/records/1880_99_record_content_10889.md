Redruth Court, 10 October.

Geach v. Jones

Geach applied for support for their child.  Jones swears the child is not his and that he has never had any improper intercourse with Geach.  The bench queried why, if that was the case, Jones had not defended the breach of promise case that Geach had brought the previous month in which the verdict went against him for £150.

Jones was ordered to pay £2 per calendar month.

In an unusual case Gustav Gebhardt had dismissed a man and his wife because he could not stand, and she would not cease, her constant hymn singing.  The man was a boundary rider and his wife a cook.  The couple sought £38-17-7 damages for unfair termination of contract.  The bench ordered they be paid 30/- that was owed them in wages, but dismissed the claim for damages on the grounds that her annoying practice was ‘a sufficient excuse for discharging a servant.’
