The Mayor was determined to have the Waterworks in credit in his term.  There was a leakage of 24,000 gallons a day.

Mr Jordan said Messrs Snell, Cook, Wilkinson, Urwin & Sons, Lane and himself did not use any water at their business places.  His Worship – Well, I don’t believe that.

Mr Jordan – none of them have taps on.

A certain user had recently been found by meter to have used 50,000 gallons when he thought they had used 20,000.  His Worship said they wanted to act fairly to all.  As soon as possible all old meters would be replaced and he guessed all would be surprised.  He said the Waterworks had been constructed on the guarantee principle and not on the concession.  The concession had only been available about ten years, 

Mr Wilkinson – longer than that.

Cr West – 14 to 15 years.
