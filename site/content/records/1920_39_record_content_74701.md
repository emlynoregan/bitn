Burra Town Council, 17 April

The Minister of Railways replies that the opening of the Ballast Quarry would receive attention in due course.

Messrs Aberg & Sons applied to have the property now occupied by Mrs Liebeknecht licensed as a slaughterhouse.  Granted.

Cr Robinson said several dogs were digging up the lawn round the Rotunda.  He wanted to know if the Act had been strengthened to allow action to be taken.

The Town Clerk said it was presently before Parliament.
