Tennis.  With so many tennis players in town there is a shortage of courts.  There are eight senior and two junior teams and at times local teams with scheduled home matches have to play away; for example at Leighton.  Five courts are available at Burra North as well as those at the school.  Planned building operations at the school are likely to deprive players of the use of four of these.  It is planned therefore to lay down six courts on the area of the former lawn courts.  An application has been made to the State Committee of Regional Employment Development for $13,000 to cover the cost and for two netball courts â€“ one at Aberdeen Oval and one at Burra War Memorial Oval.  With the building of the new clubhouse for the Burra Golf Club the present clubhouse will meet the needs of tennis players.
