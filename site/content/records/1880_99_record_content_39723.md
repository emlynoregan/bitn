Editorial on Ourselves.

With the switch to a weekly paper we will publish a weekly supplement containing 14 columns of literature and 8 to 10 columns in the paper itself.

The reasons for the shift are:

Most readers are farmers who as a rule get their mail once or twice a week and so often receive both issues of the paper together.

Most advertising clients appear to prefer their announcements to be weekly.

In the last six months Friday editions have been increasing in circulation and we believe the change will boost our circulation.
