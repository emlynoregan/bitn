Burra Town Council, 3 October.

The Mayor reported meeting the Engineer-in-Chief about the Ballast Quarry siding and that work on the Bon Accord Bridge would be completed in a few weeks.

Cr Hardy drew attention to the ‘contemptible and corrupt garbled statement published in the Burra Record of Wednesday last and said to be a report of the proceedings of the last meeting of the Council.

Cr Hardy wanted the Mayor to ask the Town Clerk to call upon the paper to correct the ‘garbled and misleading representations as published.’

The Mayor thought it was ‘inexpedient to do so’.

Cr Watt thought Cr Hardy’s question was a direct insult to the proprietor of the Burra Record and that it was ‘disgraceful’.

Cr Parks agreed.

Cr Kitchen said he was absent last meeting and that the ‘minutes and the report does [sic] not appear to correspond’.

As Cr Watt explained the Town Clerk only takes down motions and a question or two and leaves out the discussion.

Cr Hardy sought to make a personal explanation and insisted the Record’s report was incorrect.

Cr Watt showed Hardy a clipping from the Kapunda Herald: ‘What about outside misrepresentation that you write?’

Cr Hardy: ‘How do you know what I write?’

Cr Watt: ‘Anyone can tell your writing.’

Cr Rabbich said the motions as put and seconded should be reported correctly and they did not appear to correspond with the report.

The Mayor said: ‘I am pleased . . . the reported left out some glaring statements which would have made the discussion ten times worse.’

Eventually the Mayor suppressed discussion and proceeded with business.

The Engineer-in-Chief wrote asking for the right for the ballast siding to cross necessary roads.

Cr Watt moved it be granted.  Cr Linkson opposed it unless the Railways Department agreed to fix gates at each crossing.  Adding another line at the Bon Accord crossing would increase the danger there.  The siding would in fact decrease employment by cutting out a number of teams currently employed.

Cr Rabbich said in compensation more men would be employed in the quarry.

Carried with only Linkson opposed.

Cr Linkson asked the Mayor if he was aware that Mr Queale was engaging single men from elsewhere when local men with families were unemployed.
