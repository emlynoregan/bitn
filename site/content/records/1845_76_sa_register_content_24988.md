‘A South Australian’ writes, concerned about what the colony will do with all its wheat.  He says this year there is 800,000 acres under wheat, expected to yield 12,000,000 bushels.  2,100,000 bushels will be needed for seed, leaving 9,900,000 bushels for export.  After allowing for flour production this means some 260,000 tons for export.  This is more than double the 1870 total.  Victoria will be in surplus and NSW will require perhaps 25,000 tons.  Other established markets another 24,000 tons, leaving a surplus of 211,000 tons.  He recommends shipping it to England despite the somewhat lower returns expected from that market.  He has no doubts that the rising SA wheat production means that in future the surplus will have to find markets in Europe.
