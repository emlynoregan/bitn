The fire underscored the need for a better water supply.  Willing workers saved the surrounding buildings, but a reel would have helped greatly.  Even better would have been a large supply of water fed by gravity as suggested recently by Dr Brummitt.  A reservoir of 80,000 to 100,000 gallons on the hill would supply water for troughs, water carts, pipes to the larger houses and an abundant flow in case of fire.  As the supply would only go to those who wanted it there would be a great advantage over a Government scheme where all would have to pay.  Furthermore the profits would go to the town.  We are glad that the Town Council took the matter up favourably at its last meeting.  It now awaits a report from a competent engineer re costs and practicability.  This should be a scheme for the whole town and not just one ward.  Revenue then would also be the property of the whole town.

At least the purchase of a reel would not be very costly and would protect business premises.

The total loss from the fire is estimated at c. £4,000, almost all of which is covered by insurance.  Nothing was saved from the four shops.  Drew & Co.’s stores and other large shops on the other side were saved by willing work and the change and then drop in the wind.

As a consequence there will be no supplement for this or the next two issues.
