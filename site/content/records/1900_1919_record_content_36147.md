Burra Institute Committee considered new chairs to upgrade the seating from backless forms.  Sufficient blackwood chairs to replace the form in the back of the hall will be bought at 5/10 each from C.J. Pearce & Son.  The Hall Committee will determine numbers.  The committee will report next meeting on the shelving needed to convert the present reading room as a library.  The committee agreed to allow the hall to be used for Methodist services while the new Kooringa Methodist Church was being built.  (At a charge of 7/6 a time.)  Dr Brummitt has returned his photo in oil, renovated.
