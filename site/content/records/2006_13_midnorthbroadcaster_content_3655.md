Burra Railway Station will be 125 years old this year.  There are talks of a proposed presentation to be made on 16 October.  Brian Leedham of the Australian Railway Historical Society has proposed the celebrations and said it could lead to celebrations every five years, with a big one in 2020 when it will be 150 years since the arrival of the railway in Burra.  A back-to-Burra for former railway workers is another idea for the celebration.
