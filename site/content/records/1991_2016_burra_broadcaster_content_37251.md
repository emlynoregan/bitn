Letter from Patrick Vagueresse, pointing out that recently Bob Greet was mowing the grass at the showgrounds, when he struck something that destroyed his mower.  He suggests that the town should rally round and give Bob about $500 to allow him to replace the mower.  The Royal Exchange has started the ball rolling with c. $50.
