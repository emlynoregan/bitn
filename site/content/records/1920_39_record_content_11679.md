Burra Town Council, 1 October.

L.H. Foote asked that the reserve near Mr Lowe’s late residence be reserved for a children’s playground.  A public meeting will be called to form a committee.  The request was granted.

Cr Kellaway has been moved to Pt Augusta and was granted two months leave.

A public meeting has been called about the Japanese Relief Fund.  [An earthquake hit Tokyo on 1 September.  In the quake and subsequent fire 180,000 died and more than half a million homes were destroyed.]

A telephone is to be put on to the Town Clerk’s residence.

Wandering stock continue to be a nuisance.
