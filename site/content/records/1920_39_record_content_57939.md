Baldina Mongolata GM Syndicate for the fortnight to 21 September

Driving in Lean’s Shaft continued from the 92 ft level.  The north drive was extended to 12 ft and the south to 16 ft.  In the north drive the lode is split into two seams.  In the south drive towards Pexton’s, the seam on the west wall is getting a little wider.  There is some colour in the north drive, but none in the south drive.

Erecting a windlass and collar on Farnden’s Hill, to sink on a new seam.
