Glynne & Sue Ryan have developed their restaurant business since arriving in Burra five years ago.  Their small farm opposite Redruth Gaol has been known for its red deer since the time of its previous owners, Neil and Robyn Page, but venison is only one of the many dishes on the menu.    Glynne and Sue have also been involved in the community; Glynne with TAFE classes for chefs and Sue with movie nights at the Burra Town Hall and involvement in the Rock nâ€™ Roll Weekend and Jazz in the Monster Mine.
