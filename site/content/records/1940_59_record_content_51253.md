Gipsies.  A group of some 20 Gipsies passed through Burra last week and en route they invaded Sid Johnson’s Northern Café where they insisted on ‘Blessing’ his hands and ‘Blessing’ his money.  After they had gone he found that some £60-£70 of his money had gone with them.  He jumped into Mr B.H. Rogers’ Jeep and caught up with the party on the Adelaide Road.  His recent active role in the boxing ring enabled him to ‘throw his weight around’ to some purpose and he got his money back.
