Obituary.  Last evening Mrs A. Prosser, a resident of Burra, died after a few days’ illness.  She was born at Kooringa in 1875. [Numbers indistinct]  Mrs Prosser was the eldest daughter of the late Mr & Mrs E.A. Moore and had lived practically all her life in Burra, but for a short period.  Her first husband was Mr Robert Stewart [whom she married in 1895] and who predeceased her [in 1920].  She afterwards went to Victoria where she married Mr A. Prosser and then later returned to live in Burra.

[Actually she married John Archibald Prosser 1 September 1921 in the Methodist Manse at Kent Town SA.]

She was a member of the Kooringa Methodist Church and Guild.  She is survived by her husband and an adopted son, Mr Robert Stewart.  [Apparently born Carrie Harriet Moore, but the birth is not registered in SA.  She died 3 January 1942 aged 67 according to the registration of death.]
