Weather.  The heavy rains earlier this month closed the Barrier Highway in several places between Hallett and Cockburn.  The Paratoo Creek ran two metres above the Three Sister Bridge 20 km west of Yunta.  Pastoralists report widespread damage to dams, wing-banks, fencing and floodgates.  The Burra-Sturt Vale Station road has been under water in more than a dozen places between the homestead and the station boundary.  It will be weeks before that route is open. Water flowed between the homestead and the menâ€™s quarters for three days and the homestead itself was flooded for the first time since 1926.  56 of 67 paddocks had water flow through them, but it has not yet been possible to ascertain stock and fence losses.
