Burra Primary School

At the annual meeting of the Primary School the question of inadequate accommodation was raised.  At present 1½ classes are being taught in St Mary’s Parish Hall, involving students walking between the two buildings.  While fairly satisfactory at present, it would become unsatisfactory in winter.  It was suggested the present assembly room be used for the classes.  There is a room in the school unfit for use and which the Department has failed to renovate.  The Department excuse has been lack of finances, but it could possibly be on next year’s estimates.  J. Wohlers, Secretary, said local finance could be arranged if the Department repaid it in the next financial year.  The Department will be informed of this.  At present the school has four rooms and 250 pupils.
