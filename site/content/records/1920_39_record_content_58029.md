Basketball.

Men’s Red 59 defeated Gold 35 and White forfeited to Green.  Later in the report it says Green 33 defeated White 29, but White had to use two players from Gold to make up a team.  [Perhaps we can reconcile the two statements if the substitutions didn’t allow the match to count in the premiership table.  Or perhaps White forfeited part way through the game.]

Ladies’ Gold and Green drew with 10 goals each after extra time.
