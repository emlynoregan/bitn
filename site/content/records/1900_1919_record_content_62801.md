Visiting Day at Burra School is reported in 1½ columns.

At the end of 1919 there were 151 boys and 132 girls on the roll with an average attendance of 227 for the year.  The Children’s Patriotic Fund was closed last June and final returns showed Burra School contributed £491-16-4 and purchased £115 of War Certificates.

Mr Hitchcox, head teacher, gives a report.

Mr Biddle, head of the High school also reported.

1919 was a poor year for numbers there with only 17 as against 42 at the start on 1918 and at present there were only 11.  Of the 42 in January 1918, 26 were starting their first year and of these 7 removed from the district, 12 left at the end of the year and 7 are at school.  Of those who left most had just reached 14.  They have missed a golden opportunity to obtain a sound education.  As a consequence Miss Jones was transferred to Gladstone High where they can maintain an attendance of c. 40.  Influenza had also affected attendance this year.

Last year the exams saw several successes: Alma Wicklein, Grace Lloyd & Gordon Forrest gained their Junior Commercial Certificate.  Johanna Francis passed in five subjects, but failed in one compulsory one and subsequently passed the short course teachers’ exam.  Ian Finch & Cliff Bartholomaeus passed the Junior Public Certificate.

The High School is in a very precarious position and it is not likely to continue unless numbers rise.
