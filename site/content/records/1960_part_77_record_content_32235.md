Mr Bryan Tennis Players are disappointed that no one from any club in the Burra Association came to their American Tournament, although they patronise other clubsâ€™ tournaments.  Thirty-four Mt Bryan players competed with two from the Cavandale Association and two from Georgetown.  The trading table did well and in all club funds will benefit by $70.
