Editorial on the rates.  The general rate must remain at 1/- in the £, but the health rate will have to rise if we want rubbish removal more often than every 15 or 16 days as at present.  It is currently 3d in the £ and raises about £150.  At 4d it would raise c. £200 and allow for a better service.  Yet we hope for no increase this year.
