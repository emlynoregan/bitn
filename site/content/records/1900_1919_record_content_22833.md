Rabbit Law.

A 1-column article is devoted to a case highlighting a new tough law on rabbit eradication, under which, if rabbits are found on a property after notice has been given to clear them, the plaintiff is guilty of an offence regardless of the effort made (or said to have been made).  High Benjamin Knuckey Dunstan of Mt Bryan East was fined £1 + £3-12-0 costs.
