Accident.  In the early hours of Sunday morning a male driver veered off the road in Market Street and collided with a signpost and a tree and demolished a fence.  There were no serious injuries, but considerable property damage.  [The accompanying photograph shows the complete destruction of the fence between the former Smelters’ Home Hotel and the adjacent garage building along the Market Street frontage.]
