World’s End Methodist Church was broke into in the early hours of Sunday morning.  It had been set up on Saturday night for its Thanksgiving Service.  A window was broken and some of the produce spattered over the walls.  Vases of flowers were knocked over and some boxes of produce were found outside the church.  Members cleared up as well as they could and the service went ahead, but it lacked the usual feelings associated with thanksgiving.  Windows in a nearby unoccupied house owned by Mr Ken Phillips were also damaged by rifle bullets.
