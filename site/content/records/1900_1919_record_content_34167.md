Cr Wicklein introduced the idea of lighting the town with electricity.  Surely, he said, if smaller places like Crystal Brook and Jamestown could make it pay, Burra could too.  The initial cost would probably be c. £5,000, maybe less.  At Gawler it was £4,000, but the plant had to be doubled due to demand.  He moved the clerk obtain all necessary information.  The Mayor was aware of the great satisfaction expressed in Gawler.
