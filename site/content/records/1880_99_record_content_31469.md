title: Obituary.  H. Taylor went missing out east about 2 years ago and his body has
  now been found on 9 Jan. 1889 at Oakvale.  Death appears to have been from natural
  causes as his pocket book containing money was with him and a billycan with his
  name scratched on it.  [The paper actually says a search was conducted 2 years ago
  for a man missing from 3 Jan. 1886, so one might assume either one or other of these
  figures is probably wrong.]
