Cadet Corps

There is a reference to several local members of the Army Cadet Corps based at Clare, which seems to be the first reference to cadets for a long time and begs the question of whether something had happened to the Burra Corps and when â€“ perhaps a change of where it was based?  [The 411th Unit is mentioned in January 1992 as raising the flag on Australia Day.]
