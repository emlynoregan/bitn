CWA annual meeting was held on Friday afternoon.

Mrs Warnes as President said they had been granted affiliation with the National Council of Women.  This organisation will tender the Duchess of York a reception on 2 May in Adelaide and tickets are available.  Sister Bottrill of the DTNS (District Trained Nursing Society) gave a talk.

The DTNS was begun in England in 1860 and started in SA in 1893 by Rev. B.C. Stephenson, Hon. Dr A. Campbell MLC and Miss Edith Noble (a pupil of Florence Nightingale) and was financed by Sir T. Elder & Mr R. Barr Smith.  There were now 29 districts.  It was primarily intended for the very poor, but nurses were welcomed in many other homes, many of whom responded generously.  Branches now extend from Marree to Mt Gambier.
