Mt Bryan Hotel has made a commitment to provide live entertainment.  They have tried mud wrestling, which was a popular, but will be deferred until summer.  ‘Scanty’ pizza waitresses are proving popular.  Belly dancers and other surprises have been planned and this week they feature the local four-piece band, ‘Four on the Floor’.
