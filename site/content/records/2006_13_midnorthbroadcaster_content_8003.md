Burra Hospital Early Days

This historical account of the hospital was told by Alice Peak and Gertrude Williams, daughters of the late Catherine Watson who was the first trained nurse appointed to the hospital staff.  She arrived from England in 1876 on the Oaklands where she served as a nurse for passengers.  Instead of returning to England as planned, she agreed to go to Burra where a trained nurse was required.  She arrived to very primitive conditions with the hospital was a converted hotel.  Her first meal was served on the end of the kitchen table from a tin plate and pannikin, while the cook washed up on the other end of the table.  An early achievement was the use of china for staff and patients.  Domestic arrangements were crude, with waste materials thrown into a disused shaft on the hospital grounds.  When she first arrived she was disturbed by the constant noise of the stamps (ore crushers) but this did not last long, as the mine closed soon after her arrival.  Little surgical equipment was available and when an emergency arose and a saw was needed the kitchen meat saw was used to amputate a man’s leg.  Operations took place on the old bar counter.    When a typhoid epidemic broke out during the building of the railway to Terowie patients were so numerous that beds were made up on the floor of the old bar.  Gradually the situation improved.  The bar became the women’s ward and the long room became the men’s ward.  Smaller rooms were used for domestic purposes.  After two years Nurse Watson decided not to return to the Royal Berkshire Hospital in England, where she had been trained, but instead to marry C.C. Williams of Burra.  A short time after her marriage the Burra Hospital purchased its first surgical instruments and Dr Brummitt came and took her to see them.
