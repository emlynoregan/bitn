Obituary.  Edith Beryl Oates died recently – a sister to Jack Oates & Joan Carter nee White1 and a daughter of the late P.V. Oates and his wife Ivy nee Rosser.2

[Edith Beryl Oates was born 17 September 1916 at Redruth.  She died according to Burra Family Database 31 December 2002, but cemetery records show burial at Burra on 6 February 2003 – one at least seems likely to be wrong.

1 This makes no sense and should say:  Joan Carter, formerly White, nee Oates.

2 This is an error.  She was the daughter of Percival Victor Morris Oates and his first wife, Ivy Rosser Tiver.]
