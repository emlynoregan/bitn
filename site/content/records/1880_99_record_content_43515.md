Burra Town Council, 9 December.

The Mayor was too ill to attend.

Cr Rabbich was eventually voted into the chair

Crs Watt, Parks and Rabbich became the Public Works Committee.

Crs Linkson, Hardy & Kitchen the Finance Committee

After considerable discussion the Finance Committee was also appointed the Waterworks Committee.

Cr Linkson was adamant that the Mayor should be present for these decisions and at this point left the room and would not vote.

[He must have returned at some point as he appears subsequently in the report.]
