Burra Town Council sat on 4 February as a Court of Appeal. Various appeals against the assessment are listed.  M.H. Tiver appealed for a portion of Abberton Park and had it reduced 50%.  Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. had a block of land near the showground reduced from £40 per acre to £16 per acre, as that was what they paid for it on the open market.

Drew & Crewes had the assessment on the old store at Aberdeen reduced by 50% and the premises in Kooringa reduced from £360 to £320.

B.L. Symonds’ Bon Accord Hotel was reduced from £150 to £100.
