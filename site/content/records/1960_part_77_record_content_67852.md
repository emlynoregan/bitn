Following house-breaking and larceny reports on 17 July a 31-year-old Burra woman was sentenced to three months for receiving money knowing it to have been stolen.  (She received it from her children.)  A 16-year-old youth and a 15-year-old were charged with breaking into premises.  The 16-year-old was sent to McNally Training Centre till 18 and the 15-year-oldâ€™s case is being reviewed.  A 14-year-old youth is also on remand.  A charge against an 11-year-old female for receiving stolen money was found proved, but dismissed under the Juvenile Courts Act.  $220 was recovered and will be returned.
