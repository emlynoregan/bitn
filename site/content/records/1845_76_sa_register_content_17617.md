Kooringa News, 23 June

Everything remains dull.  Drays are absent because from the state of the roads they are unable to come on.

There was rain on Sunday and Monday.

Monday was a general holiday, but few people were about because of the rain.

We hear that a number of miners are preparing to leave for Wallaroo as soon as things get going there.
