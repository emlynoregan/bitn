Football begins next Saturday.  The Football Commissioners of the Mid North and the North Eastern League have met for the first time in many years to discuss some difficulties, mainly in respect to granting clearances and issuing permits.  One of the issues was the matter of players between Aberdeen and Burra and this was resolved with a number of automatic clearances between the clubs to close a matter running for a long period of years.
