Parliamentary Visit

Hon. McInnes Commissioner of Public Works, Messrs McHugh & George District MPs, Mr Eaton Engineer-in-Chief, Mr Green Engineer for Water Supply & Mr Butfield District Engineer for Water Supply.  Meeting at the Council Chamber in the evening.

Mr Woollacott asked if a telephone could be fitted to the home of Mr Isaac the local engineer for water supply, as it was important in the event of fire.  Water supply in parts of the town remained very poor with either small and/or corroded pipes with attendant problems for gardens, septic tanks and fire.  The houses in upper Kingston St had very poor supply and as they were new the fault must lie with the mains.   23 chains of 4” main were needed.  Many 2” mains led from what was currently only a 3” main.

The case for the stock agents was put by Mr Max Pearce, local manager for Elder, Smith & Co.  The stock yards have three sets of troughs capable of watering hundreds of sheep, but the supply from a very old corroded 2” main is totally inadequate and the yards are practically without water and this is imperilling the very survival of the market.  We are having to make alternative watering arrangements.  A new larger main is essential.  Ken Drew manager for Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. endorsed this.  Bert Symonds of the Bon Accord Hotel said he paid £20 p.a. in rates and got nothing for it.  The supply would not flush out the systems.

At Mongolata drinking water was being supplied from the Redruth Reformatory and this was to an extent satisfactory.  A different solution was necessary to supply a battery.  Water could either be taken from a local bore to a tank at the site or from an on-site bore or from Baldina Creek some six miles away.  There were some 300 tons of ore at grass.  A battery would stimulate production as low grade ore would not stand the cost of bags and cartage.

Mr Hogan chairman of the Prospectors’ Assoc. said they were grateful for the drinking water, but development of the field relied on the erection of a battery and water supply for it.

Cr Bevan endorsed the Mayor’s remarks and said an on-site bore was the best answer.  He believed Byles’ would employ 50 men if the battery were there.

Mr McHugh supported a bore on the site.

Mr George supported the request and thought the field had gone beyond the experimental stage and now deserved support.

Mr McInnes referred to the dire financial times.  If a scheme did not return 5% it had to be supported by taxes in some other form.  He would give the Burra problem serious thought.  There were other country and metropolitan areas in equally bad circumstances.  He thought the telephone request might be granted without further consideration.  He believed an on-site bore at Mongolata was a reasonable request and as it would aid in providing employment would be given very favourable consideration.  He did not think it likely the Minister responsible could increase rations to men who were working, but he would see what he could do.
