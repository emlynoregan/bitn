‘A Resident’ writes suggesting that the Special Magistrate should have dealt with such cases as recently brought under the Thistle Act which dates from 1862 and has had a number of Amending Acts.  It is unfair to expect JPs to have to cope with such.  Also the sitting day should not be a Monday, as when counsel is required from Adelaide they must come up on Saturday to be in Burra for court on Monday at 10 a.m.
