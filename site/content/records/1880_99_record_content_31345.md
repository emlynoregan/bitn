2nd Leader on the Balance Sheet of the Burra Town Council.

The Balance sheet of the Council is suggestive of changed times and of why the Council has been inactive of late.  There was a time when over £1,000 p.a. was spent on public works and now the total income for the year is a long way under £1,000.  We believe few places have as much to show for past spending as Burra.  Not only in the mass of trees which add so greatly to the town’s appearance, but also in the streets and footways, which are a vast improvement on the quagmires and dust holes of a dozen years ago.  Now conditions are very different and the Council has had to work hard to make ends meet.

In 1886 public works expenditure was £1,227-9-11
