Influenza in Burra

Sister Leonard answers criticisms of the Isolation Hospital.

When she was interviewed the Isolation Hospital was without patients.

We found the hospital comparatively comfortable.  The walls are grey rather than white; otherwise it looked very like any hospital ward.  A canvas ceiling has been put in place; otherwise it was like it was when the patients were taken in.  The hall was cut off by a partition.  Beds were of a good type (better than those at the Exhibition Isolation Hospital in Adelaide).  Blankets were new and adequate.  The building was airy, which is good for pneumonia patients.  The ceiling had never dripped on patients.  As for the transfer of Mrs Medwell: Nurse Miriam Pearce had been sent with the ambulance.  Mrs Medwell was wrapped in four blankets and a rug and placed on a mattress in the ambulance with hot water bottles at her feet.  The alternative story was gossip started in Aberdeen for unknown reasons and there are independent witnesses to the truth.  The staff at the Isolation Hospital are Matron Leonard, Nurse Miriam Pearce, Nurse Birdseye and Miss Robin VAD, an orderly and a cook.  There are stoves for heat and several armchairs and deck chairs.  Matron and the nurses are accommodated in tents.  Once the hospital is properly organised Matron Leonard will probably be recalled.
