Spalding Railway.  Residents in Booborowie District are loud in condemnation of the Railway Commissioner’s preference for the junction at Riverton.  They claim the Riverton-Spalding line runs too close to others, while the Farrell’s Flat option saves £300,000 and opens up new country at less expense.
