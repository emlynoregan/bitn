Burra-Adelaide Road Race was organised by the League of Wheelmen from Market Square on Saturday.  The race over 118 miles was not well publicised this year and fewer people came to see the start.  The Mayor welcomed riders.  Next year he said he understood the race would finish in Burra as it had last year.  Several riders said they preferred a Burra finish as riders tended not to disperse at the end as they did with an Adelaide finish.  This year Keith Thurgood was fastest and Richardson of Mt Gambier was the winner on handicap.
