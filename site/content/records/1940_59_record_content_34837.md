The Editor comments on a letter received on the subject of Paxton Square.  The Town Council has decided to have the area examined by the Health Officer.  The writer of the letter is quite wrong in assuming that the Council wishes to turn out into the unfriendly environment the sixty souls who live there – only a dozen of whom are men.  The people there seem oblivious to the fact that the Council is seeking to obtain for them good drainage, decent floors and lavatories and such things that make for comfortable and healthy living conditions.

‘A Denizen of the so-Called Semi-Slum Square’ writes suggesting the aim of the Council is to turn out the inhabitants who ‘are grateful for a home, however cramped, in these days when many families are homeless.’

The writer says the occupants cannot be blamed for the archaic drainage, which is just a wearisome progression of a bucket to the paddock.  ‘We ask your sympathy and help instead of being worried and heckled.’
