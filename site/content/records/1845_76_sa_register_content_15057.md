Obituary/Inquest.  An inquest was held yesterday at Gum Creek Station before Mr M. MacDermott SM to inquire into the sudden death of Donald Ross who had resided there.

Margaret Ross:

Am wife of the deceased.  He went to Adelaide last Thursday week and returned last Friday in very poor health.  He had spent two nights in Kapunda and took some medicine there.  He had great difficulty in breathing, but would not keep to his bed. He had pains in his lower chest and sometimes spat up blood.  He died at 1.25 a.m. this morning.

Alfred James Williams:

Last Sunday I called to see deceased who was up and dressed.  He looked very feverish.  I asked if he had been drunk in Adelaide.  He said not, but from his appearance I thought he had been.  He complained of a bad cough and difficulty in breathing and pain in the lower part of his chest.  He had medicine from Kapunda.  I made him go to bed and applied a mustard poultice to his chest.  He did not appear dangerously ill at this time.

Dr T.H. Mayne:

Having seen the body I am of the opinion he died from inflammation of the lungs.  There were no marks of violence visible on the body.

The jury returned a verdict of death from natural causes.

[Donald Ross died 4 November 1861 at Gum Creek Sheep Run aged 45.]
