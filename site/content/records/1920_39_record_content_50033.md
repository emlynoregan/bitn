The Kooringa Tennis Club’s desire to purchase the tennis courts was discussed.  The mayor said quite a lot of people had spoken to him concerned about Sunday tennis.  Cr Dow said it was in the Council’s power to prevent Sunday tennis.  Cr Bevan was strongly opposed to it and considered a 99-year lease as at Aberdeen was sufficient.
