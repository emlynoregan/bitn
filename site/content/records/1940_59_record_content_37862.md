The Adelaide-Burra Cycle Race

Officials of the League of SA Wheelmen met with locals in the Council Chamber last Friday.  Mr Garth, Secretary of the League, said they had taken on board Mayor Jennison’s suggestion that this year the race would run from Adelaide to Burra.  This would make the event somewhat more gruelling because there was a gradual rise in elevation from Adelaide to Burra.  He hoped for good local support and for some form of entertainment on the night before the race.  Mr R.A. Bevan pointed out that the date proposed for the race was 11 September and that would coincide with the local football grand final, which would interfere with support for the race.  Mr T.C.A. Radford pointed out that it was possible there would be a Lightning Football Carnival at Booborowie on the 18 September.  Mr Garth said the League would postpone the cycle race to 18 September.  It was also resolved that Burra would donate a £10-10-0 trophy to the winner and £5 to the first country rider to finish.  Mr Garth said it was expected there would be about 120 riders and officials in Burra on the night of the race.  The race is expected to finish at about 3 p.m. at an exact point to be decided by the Town Council.
