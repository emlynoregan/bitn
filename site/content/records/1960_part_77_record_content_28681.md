Wool was well represented.

I regret to report the deaths of two valuable supporters: Mr J.R. Field who was a member of the finance committee for a number of years and Mr Roy W. Lloyd who was a head steward and exhibitor for many years.

Thanks also go to Mr Bob Fuss for his ongoing work in altering fixtures and undertaking repairs.  He has been doing this for years and we hope will do so for many more.

Thanks also go to our secretaries Mr & Mrs Barry Taylor and the society will be the poorer for their transfer to another district and, of course, thanks go to the Vice-Presidents and the committee.
