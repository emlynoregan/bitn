Burra Defence Rifle Club.  Last Wednesday at Burra, Burra 715 defeated Kapunda 666.

A match for a marble clock was fired at the local range on 24 & 27 October.  Of 23 competitors S. Moore topped the score with 89.  To win the clock the contestant has to win three such contests so time will tell who gets it in the end.
