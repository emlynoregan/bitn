5BCS Radio

Volunteer students play music and make announcements via a loudspeaker into the amphitheatre during lunchtimes.  There is potential to broadcast to the town using the FM transmitter purchased in 1993 with funds provided by CAP.  Trial transmissions were made in early 1995, but proved to interfere with TV reception â€“ especially reception of Adelaide stations and so radio transmissions were suspended.  A new trial of transmissions is planned to measure the extent of the problem and to investigate remedies.
