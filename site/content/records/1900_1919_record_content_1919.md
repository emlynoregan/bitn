Burra Flower Show was held on Wednesday at the Institute.  There were no money prizes, but 1st and 2nd prize tickets were awarded.  The weather was not very conducive to a good display, but there were over 300 entries.  Old exhibitors did well and the names of Oppermann, Baker and Fuss were frequent and a number of young competitors were also evident.  Attendance was not so large as would have been liked, but was sufficient to make ends meet.  Results are printed.
