Burra Community Development Program Committee at their first meeting since the AGM decided to change their name to ‘Main Street’ and to use the slogan ‘Bringing Burra Together’.  The Chairman is Richard Holbrook.  The name will better connect in people’s minds to the successful ‘Main Street’ program, which focuses on regenerating the commercial centres in many rural townships.
