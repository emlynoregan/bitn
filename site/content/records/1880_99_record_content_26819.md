Burra Town Council: The Mayor’s Report for 1887

The year 1887 was one of severe depression throughout the colony.  The completion of the railway from Petersburg to the Barrier Ranges has heightened the depression locally.  Burra must expect further loss of population and business.  Some money has been saved by making the stationmen inspectors: saving a salary.  Town revenues are falling and Government subsidies are on the point of ceasing.  Next year we will receive all local licence monies and other fees in return for getting the responsibility of maintaining all roads in our boundary.  We shall receive from the Government an annual allowance, which will probably allow three stationmen to be paid to maintain the main roads and other thoroughfares.

This year started with a debt of £382-11-2 on the general account and ends with one £182 less as estimated to 31 December.

The depreciating value of properties in Burra means that the old assessment was

£14,431-4-0 and the new assessment £12,034-10-0.

£100 of bonded debt was repaid this year.  [£200 bond falls due on 1 April 1888]
