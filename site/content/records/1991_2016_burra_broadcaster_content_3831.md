Ian Auhl writes:

During a recent visit from Cr Colleen Woodgate I learnt that BCS has no qualified secondary History teacher.  If this means that no History is being taught at BCS, it needs rectifying.  Australian History should be part of the curriculum and I would be dismayed to find that no local History was being taught at some stage of schooling in Burra. Much has been achieved by a series of locals in the protection, preservation and restoration of Burra’s sites and buildings.  But it should be remembered that the basis for this work has always been historical research.  Ongoing research is needed for example into the historic roads to Burra (undertaken by Mr R.J. Noye of Clare) or the story of Burra since 1877 or the history of the Burra Smelting Works.  Of concern too should be Burra’s claim to be the Merino Capital of the World, which currently seems to be based on little except the assertion that ‘the Collinsville Merino Stud consistently receives record prices for rams’. (Tourist Brochure)

What item is there in Burra to show a tourist who is interested in the ‘Merino Capital’ idea?

‘At present it seems to me that the title (dating from 1987) was [an] after thought riding not so  much on the merino’s back but on Burra’s role as a historic mining town.’
