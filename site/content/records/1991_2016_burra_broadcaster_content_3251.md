Undertake promotion in conjunction with other interested groups, like the National Trust, the Regional Tourist Association and local traders.

Exercise delegated powers to spent funds and make decisions, including staff appointments.

A Burra Tourism Executive officer will be appointed on a two-year contract with responsibilities including:

Management and supervision of operations at the Tourist Office, Paxton Cottages, the Mine Museum and the caravan Park.

Promotion of Council facilities.

The presentation of regular reports and recommendations.

Consultation with local interest groups and traders.

Other staff:

Tourist Office – 3 part-time counter staff

Secretary – 1 half time employee

Handyman – 1 half-time employee

Paxton Cottages – 1 caretaker and 3 casual cleaners

Caravan Park – 1 caretaker

Mine Museum – 3 casual guides

It is estimated that the extra costs to change the management structure would be $8,000 in the first year.

Since Geoff and Sylvia Pearce retired the Council has operated the Caravan Park with a minimum of staff and effort.  Without an on-site manager the use of the park has declined and some complaints have been received.

The Various Section 199 Committees held their last meetings in February.  Council will be receiving a report from each committee recommending future action with reminders of forward planning undertaken and possible projects and commitments already made.  A mixed reaction has been evident in comments passed on to Council and although it is regrettable that some people feel ‘left out’, Council will still need the support of the comments during this new stage of developing the Council’s tourism.
