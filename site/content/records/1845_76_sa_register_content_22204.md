Country Breweries

[There is a lengthy article on Country Breweries: Fotheringham’s at Gawler, Allen’s Creek, Burra, Oakbank, Auburn, Clare, Strathalbyn, Penola and the Auburn Aerated-Water Factory.]

The Burra Brewery is managed by W.H. Williams and is celebrated for its very superior XX and XXX ales.  It has every appliance for the successful working of a brewery without the aid of steam power.  An excellent malt mill has recently been brought from England.  The machinery is driven by horsepower.  The tuns, coolers, boilers and other stationary apparatus are on a large scale and can turn out more than the Burra market in its present depressed state can consume.  The cellar is well adapted for storage, being hewn from limestone rock.  In it are twelve troughs, each capable of supporting five hogsheads.  Near the brewery is a galvanised iron store to house the malt and malt mill.  Adjacent is a stone house occupied by the cellarman and a four stalled stable, cart sheds and other outbuildings.  A convenient distance away is Mr William’s residence and neat garden.  The prospect of the railway and the re-opening of the mine encourage Mr Williams to continue in business.  As much as 48 hogsheads have been brewed weekly.  Four horses are at present employed on the works.
