Red Cross Society Adelaide writes to the local secretary Mrs Marston concerning the donations sent for Christmas Cheer.  As there are only three soldiers at present at the Consumptive Home on North Terrace £6 has been sent instead to Kalyra where there are nine soldier patients and £4 to the Consumptive home instead of £10 to the latter – in anticipation of Burra’s approval.
