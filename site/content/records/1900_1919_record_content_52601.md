Mr Winnall continued, saying that Dr Ashton said Terry was not drunk when he called on him.  We called on Terry, who admitted that he was drunk on his return and he said he had no complaints of neglect to make.  This was the first conflict with Dr Ashton.

Dr Ashton interrupted to claim that Terry was browbeaten.

Mr Winnall reverted to the minute of 15 August 1913.

Dr Ashton complained that an enteric patient of his had been allowed to get up during the night and he asked if the nursing staff could be considered satisfactory if that happened.  The Matron explained that the patient had sat up in bed during the absence of the nurse who was busy with a patient in an adjoining ward.  She had left a convalescent patient on watch and he reported to the nurse as quickly as possible.  The resolution was passed ‘That the action of Dr Ashton in making a complaint against the nursing staff of neglect of the enteric patient is very unfair.’

[This case was that of Mr Riese who was a delirious typhoid patient who died suddenly when sitting up in bed.]

Mr Winnall continued.  The patient was a ward patient with no special nurse and the nurse in charge had to treat him with other patients.  Dr Ashton says in his letter that the Board minute says he had been cruelly unfair to nursing staff, but I did not say that.  At the next meeting there was an apology for his absence and then he left the district, coming back after two years.

[Earlier in the statement this time interval was said to be from January 1914 to August 1915.]

When he returned he accepted an appointment as a medical officer of the hospital and remained so until he said he would not come to meetings whilst that resolution remained on the books.

Dr Ashton again interrupted: ‘History repeated itself.  It occurred again.’

Mr Winnall continued.  Dr Ashton wrote that certain enteric patients needed special attention, which the Matron said was impossible with the present staff.  In view of the Riese case Dr Ashton asked for steps to be taken to remedy this.  Mr McBride went out at 10 p.m. to obtain another nurse.

Dr Ashton interjected that it only happened because he said if a death occurred he would not sign the certificate and would write to the coroner.

Mr Winnall resumed.  Mr McBride did it: he went and got Nurse Fuss at 10 o’clock at night.

Mr Winnall then turned to orders for surgical instruments, which he said amounted to £15 worth, which were ordered without any Board knowledge or approval, after the Doctors had just submitted a list for £2 worth.

Dr Ashton returned in August 1915 and there is a resolution of the Board that he be appointed medical officer in place of Dr Sangster and in October 1915 a resolution of the Board asked the Doctors to attend meetings of the Board.  On 9 March Dr Ashton was written to drawing his attention to the closing portion of his letter of the 16 February and asking him to explain it.  He did not reply.

On 30 March 1916 Dr Morris, Inspector of Hospitals, attended a special meeting of the Board and Dr Ashton was asked to attend to thrash matters out, but he did not.  On 13 April a letter to Dr Ashton asked for a reply to the Board’s letter of 11 March.

Dr Ashton’s reply of 27 April was then read.

[This letter went back to revisit the Riese case and on that basis said conferences with the Board had proved unsatisfactory.  In reporting the incident to the Board Dr Ashton said he recommended that further nursing staff be obtained and this, he said, was interpreted as an attack on the nursing staff and the resolution ‘That Dr Ashton had been grossly unfair to the nursing staff’ was passed.  The letter went on to say that this was an improper way to receive suggestions from the medical officers.  It continued:]

It was in view of this that Dr Ashton’s letter was written in the last epidemic, when again there were delirious typhoid patients and the additional necessary nursing staff were not forthcoming.  In regard to the resolution of the Board that medical officers get permission of the Local Board of Health before sending infectious cases to the hospital we submit that cases are recommended by us as fit cases for treatment in hospital in a medical sense in our capacity as private medical practitioners and the Board has no power to dictate the conduct of our private practice, but can refuse patients admission at their own discretion.  Hence the terse acknowledgement.  We feel we should not be implicated with the financial side of the institution and the Board should make its own arrangements with the Local Board of Health for the responsibility of payment for infectious cases.  The lack of such arrangements complicates the conduct of private work in the town.  The resolution of the Board placing obstacles in the way of admitting children of tender years is especially prejudicial to the interests of children suffering from diphtheria and other acute diseases requiring constant skilled nursing.  We have no desire to interfere with the Board’s legitimate powers, but draw attention to the fact that the hospital has only two fully qualified nurses plus the Matron who has many administrative duties.

Mr Winnall then said the Mayor knows we have no claim against the local authorities in infectious disease cases unless they are admitted by the medical officer of the district or town.  As they come from many districts we suggested that the consent of the Local Board be obtained so we might collect the fees from the Local Board of Health concerned.  The Adelaide Hospital has consent without getting it in every case.  We have an agreement with the Burra Town Council.  It would be an easy matter to get into communication with the town or district clerk for the necessary consent.

Dr Ashton interjected to dispute the ease of doing this.

The discussion then moved to the issue of the admission of babes in arms.  Dr Ashton saying it was a question of saving lives.  There was nowhere else to send them.  To which Mr Winnall’s reply was that the hospital did not have the staff to deal with babes in arms and could not accept them.  They (the Board) have had to complain to Dr Ashton for doing it.  He then said the nurses were not getting the lectures required.

On 16 April 1916 there was a resolution passed asking for a conference with the Doctors.  The Doctors refused and sent the letter cited of 27 April 1916.

A further special request to attend was sent on 18 May, with no action from the Doctors.

Dr Ashton then conveyed through Mr Hawkes that he would not attend until the resolution of 15 August 1913 was rescinded.

It was then that the matter was referred to the Chief Secretary, through a letter drafted by Mr Hawkes as already outlined.

A further effort to meet with the Doctors was made in July 1916, but nothing eventuated and on 14 December Mr Crewes reported that the committee had still been unable to arrange a meeting.

The matter was again referred to the Chief Secretary on 14 September 1916, saying a meeting with the Doctors had not been possible and the Board could not carry on the management under the present circumstances.

The Board had then let matters drift.

A full explanation was made through the Inspector General of Public Hospitals.

After we discharged Dr Ashton as a medical officer me did all he could to hamper us.  He sent a telegram to the Chief Secretary about patients not being admitted and to the Inspector General that we would not admit an indigent patient requiring observation.  When I rang him Dr Ashton said the patient’s name was Harrison and I knew Harrison was earning £7 or £8 per week and we could not admit such as an indigent patient.

Dr Ashton’s Dismissal.

The hospital was short staffed and a series of appendicitis cases were coming in.  The staff was overworked and having a difficult time.  The Matron asked if operations could be arranged for early morning or late afternoon to ease staffing arrangements.  Dr Ashton refused to be accommodating.  He would arrange an operation for 10, turn up at 11.45 and run through the dinner hour.  When Matron remonstrated with him he told her she was ‘Too damned tired.’

Nurse Fuss said ‘I won’t stop if Cr Ashton is going to contradict his orders the way he does.’

Mr Winnall said despite advertising it was impossible to get nurses and if the Matron were to leave they would have to close.  There was a cancer case and Dr Ashton said he would operate in the morning, but in the morning he changed his mind.  Winnall then took the decision to admit no more until staffing improved.  He wrote to Dr Ashton asking that he put his instruction to nurses in writing – the nurses had been frightened after the Riese case.  Dr Ashton refused to write instructions and we decided he had to go.  There have been cases where Dr Ashton has operated in an emergency.  We appointed him honorary surgeon so he could come in and give the anaesthetic or carry out the operation if necessary.

Dr Ashton asked: ‘You did not seriously expect me to treat wealthy people without any fees?’

Dr Morris said that he thought there had been a misunderstanding.

There was then a discussion about who paid fees and who did not.

In the Adelaide Hospital there were no private patients, so it was different.
