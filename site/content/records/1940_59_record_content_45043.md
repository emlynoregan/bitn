Eastern Station Country

Mr Binks-Williams of Elder, Smith & Co. Ltd and John Kellock have just completed a 500 miles trip around the eastern plains from Burra.  They went as far as the NSW border with Oakvale Station.  Mr Kellock says he has never seen the country in better condition.  Mr Williams says the Adelaide Hills have not looked better in spring.  They found an amazing amount of water in small alkes and lagoons.  One Oakvale depression that has not held water since 1938, now has water up to 12 feet deep and up to three quarters of a mile across.  It should last as a water source for up to two years.  In country that usually has about 7 inches a year, 11.32 inches have fallen since 1 February.  Oakbank, with a similar average, has recorded 19.45 inches since May 1949.  The wool clip is heavier than usual.  Pasture growth is dense and fresh, though not particularly high, but it will be if there are rains in August and September.  Morgan Vale, about 120 miles from Burra has installed a pedal wireless and contacts the Flying Doctor Base at Broken Hill three times a day.  A private airstrip is being prepared at Oakbank to accommodate the Flying Doctor.
