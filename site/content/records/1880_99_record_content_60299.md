Obituary.  Mr Thomas Warnes, well-known and successful pastoralist and woolgrower, died at College Park on Wednesday.  He had been ill for some months.  He arrived in SA in 1855, going first to Mt Gambier for a few months before returning to Adelaide and then making his way north.  He did different kinds of work till 1862 when he leased the Princess Royal Block from the Burra Mining Assoc. and started sheep farming.  He lived there for 24 years and in 1868 he also took a pastoral block, which he named Koomooloo in 1875.  Later this became Old Koomooloo and in 1872 he sank the first dam there and gradually improved the property year by year.  In 1885 he and his family moved to Old Koomooloo to live, but when the lease expired in 1891 he did not renew, but moved to Koomooloo and formed another station with new buildings etc.  He was a very successful woolgrower, taking highest prices at Adelaide for many years and winning first prize for wool at Adelaide Shows.  At the Adelaide Jubilee he got the first two awards for wool from saltbush country and the following year at the Sydney Centennial Exhibition carried off the gold and silver medals for rams’ and ewes’ wool.  He was a member of the Vermin Board and in 1890 joined the Central Land Board for three years.  He also served on the Burra and Mt Bryan District Councils and for a time was a director of the Alma Gold Mining Co.  In summer he and his family lived at Glenelg, where he was an active supporter of the Commemoration Day Carnival.  He was a judge at the aquatic sports there and a member of the Holdfast Bay Yacht Club and the Austral Club.  Mrs Warnes died about two years ago.  He is survived by five sons and four daughters.  He was buried in Burra on Friday.
