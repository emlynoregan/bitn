I am past the tired stage of getting up at 4.15 a.m. and flying by 5.30 a.m.  The motto here is safety and believe me they stick to it.  The flying is done high up and all acrobats always wear a parachute, so really it is safer than walking across King William Street.  I know you will be pleased to know that John McBride is in the same hut with me at Camden.  He is the only son of Norman McBride of Kia-Ora Station.
