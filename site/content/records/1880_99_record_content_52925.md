Fitzgerald Bros. Circus.  At the circus this afternoon, the male Nubian lion attacked the tamer.  This lion had made a terrible onslaught on the tamer in Sydney recently and was behaving sullenly.  After exercising the females the tamer entered the cage armed with an iron fork which the attacking lion despatched with a swipe of its paw.  The captain then fought the lion unarmed and fought him to the back of the cage.  Then though entreated to get out by Mr Fitzgerald and assistants he renewed the struggle.  After a struggle of eight minutes the tamer was rescued by assistants using a long iron bar through the bars of the cage.  His clothing was shredded and his arms lacerated, but overall he was not seriously injured.  The lacerations were however, deep to the bone on the right arms etc.  [Having read this far the readers discovered they had been conned by a publicity piece from the circus.  This is merely a reprint from the Albury Daily News of 27 September 1893.]
