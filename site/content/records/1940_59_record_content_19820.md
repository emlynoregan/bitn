E.J. Sara writes about the damming of the creek.  He suggests a lock across the creek near the Mine Bridge.  She says when she was a school girl Mr Jaffery, Manager of the Bank Of Australasia at Aberdeen had a fine rowing boat and my mates and I were privileged to be rowed from Roach’s Mill to the ford near the Aberdeen Croquet Club.  The boys also took some of us across in flat bottomed boats.  There was a road of ford of slag across the creek between Roach’s Mill and the Mine Bridge that kept water back.  Frogs are not heard in the creek today, but were a usual sound then.
