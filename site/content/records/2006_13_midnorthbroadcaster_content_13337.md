Burra Mine

SA Mining Minister, Tom Koutsantonis, has rejected Phoenix Copper’s application to lift the protection status of the Burra Mine site.  This follows a long wait by Burra residents who have formed divisive opinions regarding the proposal.  The Minister said he had decided not to lift the reserve because ‘the heritage value of the site is too great’.

‘It’s time to mine other regions.’

He also said that to set conditions would involve ‘too many politics’ to allow it to proceed.

Although Phoenix was a good company, the return would not justify the angst.  Phoenix will still be able to explore and mine in and around Burra, but the Minister said he ‘can’t in any good conscience allow them in the Monster Mine’.

Goyder Council Mayor, Peter Mattey, felt that compromises should have been discussed.  He believed they could have opened up part of the mine site.  He felt the community was leaning toward the possibility of exploration.

He thought Phoenix would probably go on looking around the perimeter.

National Trust SA President David Beaumont expressed relief at the decision.  He said the Monster Mine was of national importance and has been nominated for World Heritage listing as a trans-national component of Cornish Mining Sites.  The site also protects important remnant grassland and 24% of the indigenous species have conservation ratings at the national, state and regional level.

Phoenix Copper managing director Peter Dowd said he did not understand the decision, but that the company was committed to exploration outside the reserve in the Burra North prospect.  He would be contacting the Minister for further clarification as there were issues that were contradictory to what has been the case previously.  The company would not be taking their bat and ball and going home.
