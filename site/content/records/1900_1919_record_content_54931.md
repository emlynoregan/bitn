Burra Hospital Board.

Nurse [B.M.] Fuss resigned as charge-nurse.  Accepted.

The Chief Secretary asked for any comments on the Board of Enquiry findings.  The Board was quite happy to regulate the admission of patients and to establish a proper routine of hours for ward visits, operations and other necessary matters.

The recommendation that the rules be brought into line with the Act of Parliament was acceptable as far as not permitting the Mayor to be an ex-officio member of the Board was concerned, but not acceptable as far as refusing paying patients was concerned.

Mr Radford moved that the Board objected to the exclusion of paying patients and to the exclusion of the Mayor being an ex-officio member.

Mr Crewes 2nd Mr Radford’s amendment, saying the Chief Secretary of the time said he intended extending the concession to all towns with hospitals.

Mr Winnall said he would be agreeable to making a suggestion that the Mayor be appointed every time, but not that it be imperative.

Mr Crewes thought a change of Government could mean fighting the whole issue over again.

Mr Dane supported Mr Radford’s amendment.

Mr McLaren said as the hospital was vested in the Corporation, provision for a representative should have been made in the trust deed.

Mr McLaren said he was not appointed as Mayor.

Mr Radford said the Council had thought that he was and it was therefore surprised when he continued in the position.

The amendment was carried on the casting vote of the chairman, Mr A.J. McBride.

The Board agreed that Friendly Soc. members and infectious disease patients should only be admitted under arrangements made with such societies and the Local Board of Health and only patients unable to pay be admitted free of charge and in emergency and accident cases the board should consider each patient’s circumstances.

The Board thought the appointment of a medical practitioner as a salaried Government Medical Officer was inappropriate in the absence of Dr Steele.
