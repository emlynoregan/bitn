Burra Town Council, 2 March

Highways Department advises that to conserve manpower only main roadworks of urgent necessity would be done.

The Burra Electric Supply Co. was ordered to brow-out all streetlights and to reduce their number to that stipulated in the agreement with Council.

Figures showed that a truck was much cheaper to operate than a horse and dray, but there is the issue of conserving petrol and this question will be further considered.
