Burra History.

This article was reprinted from the Mail of Saturday 17 October.

Eighty years ago on 15 October the first half-yearly meeting of the mine proprietors was held in Payne’s Auction Mart Tavern in Hindley St.  A shepherd named Pickett first revealed the potential wealth of Burra in 1845.  Soon hundreds of people had visited Burra.  There was only one way to get ownership of the ground and that was by a special survey of 20,000 acres.  As two groups known as the Nobs and the Snobs couldn’t agree to combine they put up £10,000 each and resolved to draw lots for the copper-bearing property which was divided into northern and southern blocks.  The northern section called Wheal Grey after the Governor fell to the SA Mining Assoc. consisting of Captain Allen & Messrs Stocks, Beck Hallett, Bunce, Penny, Graham, Featherstone, Waterhouse, Sanders, Peacock, Drew, Bouch, Smith and others.  The southern section named Princess Royal was represented by Messrs Aston & Grainger, Captain C.H. Bagot and the owners of the Kapunda Mine, two parties in England and Messrs T. Shepherd (Hindley St), Joseph Johnston (Reedbeds), F. Dutton & G. Tinline.  It soon became apparent that the Snobs of the north got everything and the Nobs had nothing and a few years later their property was sold to Alexander McCulloch for 18/- an acre.

The first shot on Wheal Grey was fired 29 September 1845, blasting a large mass of rich ore.  The SAMA had been formed with a capital of £5,000 with liberty to increase, but the quality of the deposit was that no further call was made.  The first provisional committee comprised: Jacob Hagen, Samuel Stocks Jnr, Charles Beck, Henry Mildred, W. Peacock, E. Solomon, J.B. Neales (Government Auctioneer), W. Paxton, John Ridley, G. Bean, J. Dickens, John Newman, George Stevenson (Governor’s Secretary), G.S. Kingston, Michael Featherstone & J.B. Graham.  Samuel Stocks Jnr was the first chairmen and later Resident Director on the mine at £400 p.a.  He was then succeeded by Charles Beck as chairman.  In 1847 three dividends were declared in four months amounting to 200%.  Returns in the first five years were equal to £115 per share.

The railway did not reach Burra till 1870.  For some years ore was carried to Pt Adelaide on bullock drays for shipment to Swansea for treatment.  Later smelters were erected.  In 1859 employment peaked at 1,179.  When gold was found in Victoria in 1851 the exodus left the mine with only 100 workers.  One large engine was left on the road halfway to the mine.  Water rose in the mine and operations had to be confined to the higher ground.  Miners were imported from Cornwall.  The water was then pumped out and mining resumed.  By 1877:

Copper ore won	234,648 tons

Nett amount realised in Adelaide	£3,110, 911

Cost of production	£2,284,325

Paid in wages	£1,400, 988

Paid in Dividends	£826,586

Water and falling copper prices brought the mining operations to an end.  It was not liquidated till 1916 because a vast amount of township and pastoral property remained for realisation.  The liquidator was Mr Howard W. Lloyd and a final dividend of 3/7½ a share was paid.  Only desultory attempts have been made to find further deposits.

The mine is not much more than a large open cut with deepest workings of only a few hundred feet.  Perhaps when copper prices rise the work may begin again.  In the meantime Burra is one of the most important stock centres in the north.

Once upon a time the hills were lightly timbered with gum and sheoaks.  Kooringa means Sheoak Creek.  There were acres of scrub and valleys were prolific in vegetation and the hills and dales were clothed in wild flowers.  The timber all went within 12 years and vast herds of goats used for milk stripped herbage clean to the roots.  Since then the municipal authorities have done much to plant trees and an avenue was planted from Kooringa to Aberdeen as a memorial of Queen Victoria’s Jubilee, when Sir Frederick Holder was Mayor.  (Later a Premier of SA and first Speaker of the Commonwealth House of Representatives.)  There are remains of primitive dugouts in the clay banks of the Burra Creek – masons being scarce and the cartage of building materials by bullock dray not feasible, so the miners ‘dug in’.  These rude houses were unhealthy, unsafe, unsanitary and badly ventilated.

Later scores of cottages were erected by the company.  The directors put up a school, church and hospital and provided a fine recreation ground.*

There was once a gaol in Burra and in later years it was used as a girls’ reformatory.  Mrs Holden (mother of the chairman of Holden’s Motor Bodies Ltd) was matron there for some years.  The municipality was proclaimed in July 1876 and Philip Lane was the first Mayor.

Many old hotels have gone: the Pig & Whistle, Miners’ Arms, Bushman’s Home, Smelter’s Home & the White Hart.  Alfred Barker, father of the late John Barker, kept one of them.

Why is it named Burra?

The minute book of SAMA says:

‘The mines are Named the Burra Burra mines from their being situated near the creek of that name, and the word Burra meaning in the native language “great”’.  Signed by Samuel Stocks Jun.  First Chairman of Directors, but the secretary (Sir Henry Ayers) pencilled in:

‘Not native, but Hindoostanee.’

Before 1845 coolie shepherds had been employed in the area by the pioneer pastoralist James Stein.  The name sounds Aboriginal and appears widely throughout the Commonwealth with a wide variety of meanings in different languages.  Stein, who had the country before the copper discovery, was a brother of Anne, Countess of Fife, and his father sat in the House of Commons for Bletchingley.  He died in poverty at Mt Gambier in 1877.

[* The directors gave the land for the school and church and provided a hospital for mine employees.  The town hospital came later when the original Burra Hotel was purchased for the purpose.  The land for the recreation ground was provided, but not the cost of fencing or development of the site.]
