Fire broke out in Whitney & Tiver’s Garage about 12.40 Monday night.  It was noticed by Bruce Morgan of Aberdeen.  The fire station was alerted and water turned onto the fire, by which time there was fire right along the ridge capping.  A fused wire seems to have been the likely cause.  Though the garage was full of cars only one suffered damage when it received a badly scorched hood. Damage is estimated at £200 to £300.
