Victorian Bushfire Appeal

Members of the Sing Australia Burra Choir together with local businesses raised $4,000 in the Victorian Bushfire Relief Appeal Community Singalong at the Burra town Hall on Sunday afternoon.  Around 80 members of the public joined in the singalong and donations of goods and services were auctioned to raise $2,367.  Donations increased the total to $4,000.  Event co-ordinator and choir leader John Fuss was amazed by the generosity of the public.  The event was organised very quickly from an idea that came to John on Tuesday.  A separate sum of $470 was raised for disaster-struck animals.  As well as thanking all donors and the public, Mr Fuss gave special mentions to Darryl Venning for gathering all the lots from businessmen and to auctioneer Andrew Butler.  Afternoon tea followed the singalong.  [Donors are listed.]
