The Recent Kooringa Floods

It is estimated that more than £2,000 worth of property has been destroyed in the floods, in addition to a large sum of money said to be lost by those living in the banks of the Burra Creek.  As a result money is scarce and trade dull.  The general calamity to those who lived in the creek, who generally hide their treasures for safety’s sake in little holes made in the walls of the caverns in which they live, is proof of the need for a banking agency in Kooringa.  It is to be hoped the day is not far distant when some banking accommodation will be afforded the tradesmen of Kooringa as well as the industrious workmen.  It is understood that the Burra Company has decided to erect a large number of additional cottages so that there will be no excuse for living in the banks of the creek.  Very many of the huts have fallen in, and we are gratified to learn that as soon as new cottages are completed the Company intends to unfit the banks of the creek for the excavated huts now so numerous in them.  The unfortunates washed out of the creek are deeply indebted to the Rev. James Pollitt and Mr & Mrs Powell for the kind attention they have received at their hands.
