Burra Town Council, 4 April

Resolved on Cr Robinson’s motion that the wheel of the war gun near Dr Steven’s be repaired.

Aberdeen Ballast Quarry.  Many thousands of yards of ballast have been taken from the quarry on Elisha Ford’s property and at times 50-60 men have been employed.  Why it has been closed in favour of a quarry at Sleep’s Hill is not known – at the time the contractor said he could supply it as cheaply as Sleep’s Hill Quarry.  Cr Lott said the Council should move to have the quarry re-opened.  Cr Jeffery said he had argued at the time with the Commissioner who tried to convince him it was as cheap to carry ballast to Terowie from Sleep’s Hill as it was from Burra.  A motion for a deputation to wait on the Commissioner on this matter was carried.

Burra Town Council decided last meeting to buy a watercolour of Kooringa depicting the Burra Mine in the days before the open cut.  Mr H. Dingle of Adelaide has offered it to them for £3, though he had paid £5 for it.

Mr Davey the Town Clerk had written to P. Milner asking him to have a look at the picture.  The latter had said it was a painting of the Mine in 1847 and should be of value to the town.

Cr Lott moved that it be purchased (he had seen it).  Motion carried.
