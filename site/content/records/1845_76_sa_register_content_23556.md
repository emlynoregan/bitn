The Opening of the Northern Extension Railway: a History of the Line

While the desirability of a line to Burra was long acknowledged, the financial lessons from earlier construction discouraged an expansion of the system.  Several surveys were carried out to select a route as preliminaries to Parliamentary approval.  Eventually there was enthusiasm to extend railways and attention focused on a line from Roseworthy or Freeling up the Gilbert Valley towards Mt Remarkable.  In 1866 a select committee decided it was worth immediate consideration.  In 1867 the then Commissioner of Public Works, Mr Santo, supported by petitions from inhabitants, and sympathy in the House introduced a Bill to extend the line then authorised from Roseworthy to Foresters, to Redruth.  The Bill was passed with great enthusiasm and a loan of £264,000 was specifically approved for this extension.  The line from Roseworthy to Tarlee (Foresters) was built for a little over £5,000 per mile.  Beyond the route takes 46½ miles to reach Redruth following the course of the Gilbert through fertile agricultural country, much of it already taken up.  The construction took two years and a few months.  Compensation for land acquisition was kept to £110 per mile.  Mr Haynes had the first contract for earthwork and masonry for 7 miles from Tarlee.  Mr Bloomfield then had a contract for 14 miles and Mr Walker one for the following 14.  Messrs Fry had the next 11 miles and Mr Tiver the last half a mile to the terminus.  There are no major engineering challenges in the line beyond Tarlee; nothing to compare with the bridge over the Light at Hamley Bridge.  The Gilbert and Wakefield are crossed with 60 ft spans.  The masonry has cost about £400 per mile.  [Details of earth moved and of cuttings and embankments are given.]  Sleepers were supplied by John Rounsevell and are solid gum 9 ft long, 9 inches wide, 4½ inches thick.  3,000 cubic yards of ballast is laid per mile, giving a depth of 8 inches.  The permanent way is of wrought iron rails 40 lb to the yard.  There are eight stations on the route and strict economy has been observed in their construction.  They are plain, but where necessary good stone houses have been erected for the stationmaster.  The goods sheds are generally roomy, being from 60 to 100 ft long by about 56 ft in width.  They have stone foundations, timber framing, galvanised iron cladding and wrought iron principles for the roof.  Extensive platforms have been provided and cranes and other facilities for large traffic, along with facilities to handle stock.  Station buildings and associated features cost £14,500, which is rather more than estimated.  The contractors for this work were Messrs Sara & Son, Schroeder & Wishart and J. Tiver.  The fencing is in wire with cast-iron straining standards set at intervals of 600 yards.  Intermediate standards are of T section wrought iron 14 ft apart.  [Further details are provided.]  The fence is strong and good, capable of resisting the ordinary pressure of small and great cattle and immune from damage by fire and requiring little in repair.  At £340 per mile this exceeds estimates by £120 due to difficulties with the material supplied.  Mr P. Galt the Resident Engineer has superintended the entire construction.
