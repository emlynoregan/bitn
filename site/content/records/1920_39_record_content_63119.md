The Mayor said he felt proud of the achievement of his fellow townspeople.  Hundreds of still and moving pictures had been taken of it and Burra had never had such wonderful or so cheap advertisement.  Mr Hans Heysen, the renowned artist, said the Burra Float was the most complete unit in the pageant and leading citizens of other towns had asked that it might visit their localities.
