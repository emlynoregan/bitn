History of the Burra Record by Ian Auhl

Supplied by the Burra History Group

• The paper began on 30 June 1876 as The Northern Mail [The premises was on part allotment 72 Commercial Street, in 2017 this is the property opposite the roadhouse]

• Six months later it changed its name to The Burra News and Northern Mail.

• In July 1878 its new editor. Frederick William Holder announced its new title would be The Record.

• On 4 October 1878 the name changed again to The Burra Record.

• It had taken a long time for Burra to get a local paper. Compare its starting date with The Kapunda Herald (1864). The Kadina & Wallaroo Times (1865) and The Northern Argus (Clare. 1869).

• Burra had to make do with printed handbills for advertising and a town crier.

• The cost originally of 3d made it too expensive for many and kept its circulation low; 600 by the end of 1876.

• In October 1878 Holder became the sole proprietor.

• Under Holder the paper flourished. He became Mayor of Burra in 1886 and again in 1888, having been elected to Parliament in 1887. He was later Premier of SA on two occasions.

• In September 1880 Holder announced they would move next door because the original office (in Commercial Street) was about to be demolished to make room for two new shops to be built for Messrs Drew & Co.

• Three years later on 6 January 1883 four shops on Market Square were destroyed by fire: Lane's Saddlery, Geake's store, Packard's Solicitor's Office. Doe's Hairdressing Salon and the Burra Record Office.

• Despite the complete destruction The Burra Record appeared later that week, having been printed in Adelaide.

The shops were rapidly rebuilt.

• Late in 1883 the paper was issued twice a week and the price fell to 2d.

• In 1890 Holder sold the paper to Mr P. Murrie Jnr.
