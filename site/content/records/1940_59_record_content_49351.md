CWA Visit by Countess of Albemarle

Uncertain weather caused the rally to be transferred from the Playground to the Town Hall on 3 March.  The hall was nearly filled.  Lady Albemarle was accompanied by Mrs Burton, Divisional President of the CWA; Mrs C.M. Octoman, State President; Mrs Dolling of the State Council; Miss Wein-Smith, Group President; Mrs I.J. Warnes, founder of the CWA in SA; Mrs Andrew Tennant, Burra President; Mr W. Carpenter, Mayor of Burra and Mr Stanley Hawker MP for the District.

Mrs Burton spoke of the purpose of Lady Albemarle’s visit and the Mayor welcomed her, as did Mr Hawker.  Mrs Octoman introduced Lady Albemarle, who brought greetings from the Women’s Institutes in the UK.  She then spoke of their meetings and their Choral Festival in the Albert Hall in London with a choir of 8,000 voices.  Miss Wein-Smith proposed a vote of thanks.  Lady Albemarle was the guest of Mr & Mrs Andrew Tennant at ‘The Gap’ for the weekend.
