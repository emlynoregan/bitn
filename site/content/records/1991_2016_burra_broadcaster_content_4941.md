Redbanks Reserve

Redbanks has been a popular community recreation area for many years.  After it became popular with motorbike riders and off road recreation vehicle users, a number of accidents led to the Government closing it in December 1992.  It was then declared a Conservation, Recreation and Education Reserve under the control of the Burra Burra DC on 26 November 1993.  The reserve was closed to the public pending a draft plan.  Off road recreational vehicles will not be allowed back.  The draft plan suggests:

The removal of feral animals

The prohibition of dogs and cats on the reserve

That horses be restricted to defined areas on a trial basis

The continuation of the ban on off road vehicles

The plan also addresses maintenance, visitor access and future management.  The draft is available at the Council Office and public comment is invited.
