The Burra Art Gallery has an exhibition of photographic works that was opened by the well-known Terowie photographer John Ogle.  The exhibition features photographs by Brokenshire, Jenkinson and Wooler of the early years of Broken Hill.  Also on display is the somewhat ugly emu egg inkwell that was kindly gifted to the Burra Burrs DC from the Lane Family descendants of Burraâ€™s first Mayor, Philip Lane.
