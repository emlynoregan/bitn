Goyder Council will increase its rate income by 11.25% for 2008-09.  CEO John Brak said this increase, which would yield and extra $300,000 will only offset the rising cost of maintaining machinery, the 40% rise in the cost of bitumen and the cost of maintaining gardens etc.  The changeover to transfer stations from dump sites as required by the EPA would also add to costs.
