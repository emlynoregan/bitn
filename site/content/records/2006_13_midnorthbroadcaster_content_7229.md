Market Square Museum has reopened after being closed for a month for renovations.  The interior has been completely redesigned to closely represent the way it used to be, to the delight of volunteer, Linda Rooke.  The attached home at the rear has also been repaired and redecorated.  The front will operate as a lolly shop with an attached museum.  The shop is currently open 2 p.m. to 4 p.m., but this could be extended if the National Trust can get more volunteers.  [Photo: Linda Rooke in the shop.]
