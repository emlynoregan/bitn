Burra Mine.

The Director of Mines, Dr L.K. Ward, has written to the Burra Progress Assoc. asking for a more detailed proposal concerning the opening of the Burra Mine.  He says he needs costs for:

Reconditioning Morphett’s Shaft to 600’

Reconditioning Graves’ Shaft to 300’ and extending it to 510’.

Equipping both with poppet heads and winding apparatus.

Buying and installing duplicate pumping appliances for both shafts and a sinking pump for Graves’.

A specified amount of crosscutting from both.

Connecting with, or installing electric power as needed.

Keeping water pumped out during the development program.

Purchase and installation of compressed air units as required.

He also needs details of the proposed company, of staff and their qualifications and experience and of the nature of the title to the mine.  In addition he needs information on the amount of capital subscribed or promised.
