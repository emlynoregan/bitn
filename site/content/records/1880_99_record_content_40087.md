‘Puzzled’ asks who runs the Burra Hospital.  Does it run in the interests of any particular religious organisation in town as a list of Board members suggest the possibility?  Who recommends new members?  The new board included gentlemen ‘who have scarcely been in the town a week, whilst there are dozens of old residents who deserve the honour (if there is any)’.  It appears these public matters are run by cliques.

The editor suggests a letter to the chairman of the board might throw light on the matter as he cannot.
