The Eastern Selectors.  The local MPs Holder and Rounsevell presented a petition to the Commissioner of Crown Lands on Wednesday from 37 selectors in the Hundreds of Baldina, King and Rees, setting out their difficulties.  When they selected their holdings it was expected they could be successfully cultivated, but this has proved impossible and in the whole district more seed wheat has been sown than wheat has been harvested.  The majority of selectors have now expended all their capital and cannot even migrate to other parts of the colony.  The proposed District Council Act will bring further costs they cannot meet.  They ask for a reduction of rent to 2d an acre.  The Commissioner has refused the request because such a move will fall within the powers of the new Lands Boards which are due to be initiated ‘at an early date’. 

A similar petition from occupiers of educational and miscellaneous leases was also denied.  The Commissioner said he had no power to reduce such rentals and could only suggest surrender on payment of three months rent in advance.
