Obituary.  Mr Horton Joseph Barraclough Jennison

Mr H.J.B. Jennison died at Burra Hospital on 8 October at the age of 69.  He was one of the town’s best known and most respected businessmen, citizens and philanthropists.  He first came to Burra in 1914 when his father was appointed minister of the Redruth Methodist Circuit.  Later he married Miss Reta Thomas, daughter of Mr & Mrs H.H. Thomas of Aberdeen.  Mr Ray Jennison of Burra is a son and two daughters, Barbara and Josephine are married and living in Melbourne.  Another daughter, June, is deceased.  Mr Jennison established the firm of Jennison’s Tyre Service in Commercial Street and was an active partner in the firm up to the time of his death.  Mr Jennison loved his family, his town, his country, his church and his fellow men.  For two years in the 1940s he was Mayor of Burra.  He was always dignified, loyal and eloquent, making him a capable Mayor whose service will not be forgotten.  He was one of the forces behind the establishment of the Mar Memorial improvement Committee and rendered valuable service as a Justice of the Peace.

Mr Jennison was a volunteer for service in both World Wars.  The continued welfare of ex-servicemen was close to his heart and he was active in the local RSL sub-branch, serving as its President for some time.  He was also most dutiful in attending to the needs and education of Legacy wards.  He gave more than a fair share of his time to local schools.  For many years he was a member of the Primary School Committee and of the High School Council, being Chairman of the latter from 1953-64.  When the present House System was established at the High School in 1961 he consented to have one of the Houses named after him.  One of the last memories many students will have of him will be his presence at their sports day this year, urging on his House.

He was an ardent Lodge man, being a member of several.  He was Right Worshipful Brother in the Grand Mark Lodge and Lodges were well represented at his funeral.  He was a staunch member of the Redruth Methodist Church and since its amalgamation with the Kooringa Circuit, of the new Burra Circuit.  He was a Church steward and Circuit Steward for Redruth 1939-42 and Secretary of the Redruth Trust, which he served for many years, from 1951 till his death.  He was born on the Mission Fields of Fiji and was the local Secretary for Overseas Missions for a long period.  The funeral was held most appropriately at the Redruth Church, which he had loved so well.
