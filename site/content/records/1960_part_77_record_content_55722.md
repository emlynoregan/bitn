Burra Mine

Samin Ltd’s plant has now been commissioned and has a treatment capacity of 250-300 tones per day and is working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  The stock pile is being roofed to reduce dust and keep ore dry during wet weather.  The finished product is a black powder of copper oxide assaying at 70% copper and will be shipped to smelters or to chemical plants.  Washed ore is loaded into five large tanks of some 350 tons capacity and subjected to four days of leaching with a 10% ammonia solution.  The solution containing some copper is pumped into the product recovery section where it is washed and steamed to recover any remaining copper and ammonia.  These washings are made up to strength by adding fresh ammonia and become the leach solution for the next tank of ore.  The copper rich solution is steamed or boiled in an evaporator and the ammonia is driven off and reclaimed in the scrubbing section, to be reused once the copper precipitates as copper oxide.  After steaming the evaporator is discharged into a thickening tank and the oxide settles to the bottom and the clear hot water overflows from the top of the tank to be used again.  Copper oxide is removed from the bottom of the tank as a black slurry and pumped to a continuous filter which removes most of the water, leaving a semi-dry cake of copper oxide.  In total 46 are employed at the mine and of the 10 staff members 5 are local.  Of the 21 employed on plant operation 16 are local and 15 are employed in quarrying.  When the fourth permanent Housing Trust home is completed two will be occupied by members of Samin and two by Roche Bros.

There are ten transportable houses; seven occupied by Samin employees and three by employees of Roche Bros.  The company has also bought three established houses in Burra, occupied by Messrs:

H. Rich, Operations Manager

A. McFarlane, Metallurgist and Mill Superintendent

N. Van Buuren, Works Maintenance Engineer.

Roche Bros have bought a Burra North home, which is occupied by Mr Lyle Quinn.
