Rabbits. There is a fear that some Legislative Councillors with pastoral interests hope that rabbits will drive farmers off grazing land. Some farmers are indeed in the position of deeming it futile to plant grain as they reap less than they plant. Things are very bad east of Burra at Baldina and Mongolata and also further north at Banbury. At Mongolata for instance on 3 of 2,000 to 3,000 almond trees remain on F.T. Jones property, and then only because the dogs were tied up next to them! This was a loss of £200. Mr Moyle got only 5.5 bags of wheat from 60 acres instead of an anticipated 600 bushels - a loss of £ 115l8/-.
