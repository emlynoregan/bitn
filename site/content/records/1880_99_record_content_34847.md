Christmas Eve in Burra was lively.  The town was decorated with greenery brought in by the cartload and used to festoon the business places.  The weather was bright and pleasant and the streets were soon thronged with young and old.  By the time it was getting dark the pavements were impassable.  Business places were all decorated and doing good trade.  After tea the crowds forced the use of the roadways and the sound of children’s trumpets filled the air.  The Salvation Army appeared with its music, but failed on this occasion to draw people away from other attractions.  Mr Wheatley’s Band appeared in front of Bath & Pearce’s while Davey’s Band was at the pump.  Business places were packed and it was generally deemed the best night’s business since the mine closed.

Christmas Day.

Cricket was played in the afternoon and the Burra Cricket Club with 5 for 131 defeated a team of 15 visitors and local players, 53.  For Burra, Parks took 8 and Herbert 6 wickets.

The Wesleyan Church had the Friendly Societies’ Church Parade at 11 a.m. and Davey’s Band led the Oddfellows, Foresters and Rechabites from the Institute to the Hospital and thence to the church where Rev H.T. Burgess preached.  During the service Davey’s Band played inside the church.

Kooringa Primitive Methodist church held their usual tea meeting.

The Anglicans had Holy Communion and Matins at St Mary’s.

The Salvation Army held its usual form of worship.

Boxing Day saw the Foresters’ Picnic and Sports at the Burra Oval.  Wheatley’s Band led them there soon after 11 a.m.  There was a large attendance.  £19 was taken at the gate and a large program was successfully carried out.  The results are printed.

There was a ‘big go’ in the evening at the Salvation Army ‘where a monster tea-fight was held to which a large number sat down’. 

No larrikinism was reported for the holidays.

Mr W.T. Rabbich’s essay on Christmas won the recent Christmas Festival and Exhibition in connection with the Wesleyan School, Kooringa.  Rev. S.F. Prior of Adelaide was the judge.  The essay is printed in c. ¾ column.
