Mr Ron Thamm from Burra St John’s Ambulance Brigade gave an interesting talk on mouth to mouth resuscitation.  The secretary’s report showed an average attendance at the clinic of 40 per month. Sister McMahon will retire at Christmas and from 10 July Sister Moody will come from Balaklava every alternate Friday.  On 24 April Lady Bonython opened the Burra Clinic.  Thanks to the CWA for the use of their rooms and to Mr Baulderstone for the use of his parlour for clinic days.
