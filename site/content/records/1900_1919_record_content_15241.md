Obituary & Inquest.  The late M-C Jemison who died at Kadina last week leaves a wife and six children.

M-C Jemison’s life ended sadly at the Central Hotel in Kadina on Sunday 5 November.  He will be remembered in Burra where his term was marked by a variety of unusual circumstances.  About 3years 8 months ago he was transferred to Wallaroo and later to Stirling.  He resigned from the police and kept a store at Paskeville.  His death was sudden, but not entirely unexpected.

A letter from Mrs Jemison caused P-C Baker of Kadina to seek him out and he was found to be very ill at the Central Hotel.  Blake asked him to go home, but by 11 o’clock he was too ill to travel and appeared to be having a fit.  He had been drinking whisky and an envelope nearby bore the word ‘strychnine’, but he denied having taken any.  He complained of head and chest pains, but insisted they were only ‘the old complaint’.  When the doctor arrived he was already dead.

Ebenezer Phillips of the Salvation Army has spoken to him on Sunday morning at the railway station when Jemison had admitted he had contemplated suicide and said he had been fighting the night before and expected the police were after him.

Dr Powell said the symptoms matched strychnine poisoning.

Mrs Jemison said her husband had recently taken to drink because of severe head pains and the previous Saturday he had experienced a fit and for fifteen minutes they had thought him dead.

The verdict was death by poisoning but with no evidence to show whether by alcohol or strychnine.

[Joseph Richard Jemison was born 28 November 1863 at Pt Elliott and died 5 November 1905 at Kadina.]
