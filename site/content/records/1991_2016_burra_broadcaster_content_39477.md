Bill Phin recently celebrated his 90th birthday.  His father, Bill Phin Senior, started Phinâ€™s Store at Hallett in 1926 and the family sold the business in the mid-1960s.  Bill Jnr worked at the store and married Booborowie girl, Maisie Pearce.  Bill and Maisie moved to Booborowie many years ago.
