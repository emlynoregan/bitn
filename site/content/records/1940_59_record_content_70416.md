Mt Bryan CWA will soon move into its own room in the Mt Bryan Hall.

The Hall committee has disposed of the billiard table and when some minor repairs are completed the room will make a good home for the CWA, which recently contributed Â£30 towards the cost.

Quite a deal of money will soon have to be spent on maintenance of the hall.  A large bonfire was held on Guy Fawkes Night in the school grounds and everyone enjoyed the fun, except for Guy, who was tossed unceremoniously on the fire to end the evening.

Mrs W. Carpenter Sen. is 87 today.  She was born in Burra.

Grasshoppers.  The Department of Agriculture is preparing to carry out aerial spraying for grasshoppers where swarms are large enough to justify it.  The co-operation of landowners in reporting swarms is urged.
