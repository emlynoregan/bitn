Burra Bowling & Croquet Clubs opened their season on Saturday afternoon.  During the recess a clubhouse of £400 was erected.  There is a ladies’ room, a men’s room and a kitchen with verandahs on the east and north sides.  The only unwelcome guests on the day were the locusts, which hardly made for good bowls.  They hope soon to install electric lights.  In the absence of Mrs Gebhardt though illness, Mr Gebhardt called on Mrs Marston to break a bottle on the threshold to open the clubhouse.
