Burra Political Meeting

A meeting at the Burra Burra Hotel on Monday drew between 200 and 300 electors to hear Mr Morris Marks explain his political views.  William Young was called to the chair.

Mr Marks said he was responding to a numerously-signed requisition from Clare and Burra people.  He was a man for public rights.  He was Liberal in principle, would promise nothing, but would do his best to promote their interests.  He was concerned that large sums of money had been expended in getting migrants to come to SA, when it was known their real destination was the eastern colonies.  Many stayed only a few days in SA before starting for Melbourne or Sydney so that SA had all the expense, but none of the benefit.  He felt that the system of selling crown lands required change to enable the poor man to obtain land without paying an exorbitant price.  Taxes should rise for those holding vast stretches of land that were uncultivated and unimproved.  The farmers should pay less tax.  Education was important and teachers should be paid more.    He favoured the construction of railways as a means of developing the agriculture of the colony, which was being held back by the high cost of transportation.  The roads south of Adelaide had been maintained, but those north of Gawler had been totally neglected.  Even if this was not a great agricultural area, it was a great wool growing and mining district and if the mines failed it would severely affect the whole colony.  He favoured distilleries.  He advocated a simpler land transfer system.  He favoured free trade.  Mr Woollacott proposed Mr Marks as a fit and proper person to represent the District of Burra and Clare.  A show of hands resulted in ten for and one against the proposal.
