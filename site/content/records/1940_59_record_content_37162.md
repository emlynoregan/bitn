Ernest Edward Spec Davies, of Stone Hut, ganger for the SAR:

On 5 May he and his wife were driving from Morgan to Burra.

They encountered a man standing alongside a bicycle and he recognised Weiss.

They gave him a ride into Burra and he told them he had a bullet wound in the foot.

As he was about to get into the car Weiss said ‘I don’t know but what we ought to go back for the girl.’

He added ‘There’s a girl back there with a bullet wound in the stomach – possibly serious.’

He also said ‘It may be just as healthy if we did not go back.’

‘Witness took Weiss straight to Burra Hospital and immediately took him to Police Station.’ [Sic -?]

Witness said he did not the wounded girl in the house much consideration and he did not want to go back because Weiss had said it might be just as healthy if we did not go back.
