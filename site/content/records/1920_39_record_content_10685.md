Burra Hospital Board met on 23 April.

There was considerable discussion about the case of the recent hospital porter who seems to have been posing as a returned soldier under the name of Kennedy.  He had served well till he had a breakdown.  A new porter called Watson, from Adelaide, has been appointed.

[Evidently at the previous meeting or the one before the matron had been asked to resign.  The report on 11 April of the meeting of 26 March mentions advertising for a matron qualified in medical and obstetrics nursing, but says nothing about resignation, neither is there a mention in the 7 March report of the meeting of 26 February.]

The matron has not handed in a resignation and is asking for a Board of Inquiry.  Chairman (W.G. Hawkes) then said her resignation would be required at once, that having been decided.

Two applications had been received from Sister Crawford and Sister Muriel Johnson and the latter was appointed.  About two weeks later Sister Lang’s resignation had not been received and the House Committee advised her that her agreement with the Hospital Board would expire on the date arranged for Sister Johnson to take up her duties.

Immediately after the meeting.  [Presumably that of the 26 March.]  W.G. Hawkes told matron her resignation must take effect from a month from that day.  He waited a week, heard nothing and spoke to her and said it must be sent in at once and take effect a month from that day.  [2 April, so resignation 2 May.]  Another two weeks passed and hearing nothing the House Committee then wrote as above [a few days before the April meeting].

Mr Warnes said that in such a case the Board discharged her.

Mr Warnes asked if the reason was the excessive running costs of the hospital in the last three years.

Mr Hawkes said that and the inharmonious relations with the Board.

Mr Warnes suggested that the Board’s actions seemed precipitate – advertising the position three days after asking her to resign, given they had taken three years to find fault with her.  He also suggested she should have been accorded more restrained treatment as a returned nurse.  [Mr Warnes had been in Sydney on 26 March.]

This caused general dissent.

Dr Steele [who had also been absent on 26 March.] then said that he thought it had all been done on the spur of the moment.  He felt she should have been allowed to put her case at a Board meeting.  He questioned the propriety of the action taken: ‘no notice was given to the doctors or anyone else that such a move was contemplated’.

Mr Collins then objected to Dr Steele being allowed to speak.  Dr Steele asked the Chair to note that a member objects to the responsible Medical Officer speaking at a Board meeting.

Mr Warnes wondered why the matter had not been reported fully before.

It was pointed out that the Matron’s uniform allowance was due in May and that the Matron had not taken all her holidays – in fact only once in the three years.  The Board then voted to give her the uniform allowance and one year’s holiday allowance.

The Government was supposed to be subsidising the income 30/- in the £, but the Council had contributed £647 and the Government had so far paid only £250.

The Matron sent an undated letter asking to appear before the Board.

Dr Steele wrote saying in such a vital matter as the position of Matron the Medical Officer should have been present.  The Board received the letters.

As the Board would not consider his letter Dr Steele said he would forward a copy to the Inspector General of Hospitals.
