Burra Community Development Committee has been allocated $132,000 to establish a telecentre at Burra Town Hall with the aim of it becoming a viable, self supporting community enterprise.  It will feature computers and internet access, one-on-one and group training using Microsoft Office products and other software, including the use of the digital camera and scanner.  Photocopying, scanning and secretarial services are also on the drawing board.
