BCS.  The foundation stone of the old school building was laid 120 years ago on 27 February 1877 by Thomas Bath.  It was built to accommodate 800 to 900 students at a cost of £6,976.  Construction was by G. & W. Sara and Dunstan.  The opening of the Burra Hospital took place on the same day.  The town celebrated with a half holiday – shops closed at noon and miners had time off.  Sir Henry Ayers opened the hospital and after ‘a capital lunch’ the official party proceeded to the Burra Institute, from which a procession was formed to go to the school site.  It was led by the Burra Brass Band, followed by 20 Freemasons, Oddfellows, Foresters and Rechabites, each order in full regalia.  At the rear came the members of the Ministry present, the Mayor and Councillors of Burra, Mr Bath, etc.  A crowd of almost 1,500 gathered at the school site, where Mr Bath as the earliest established businessman laid the foundation stone with a silver trowel made by Alfred Day, an Adelaide jeweller.  The band then played the Song of Australia and the crowd then gave three cheers for The Queen, three for Mr Bath and three for the ladies.  The official party ended the day with a fine dinner and the usual speeches.  For the general public there was a musical and literary entertainment at the Institute.
