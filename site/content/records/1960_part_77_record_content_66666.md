Hedley Scholz writes a long letter on behalf of the Eudunda Actionist Group of the League of Rights.

[Generally he fears the introduction of a socialist state by the Whitlam Government and a move towards a totalitarian state.  Governments which are elected on the basis of promising the most benefits from the public treasury are inevitably followed by a dictatorship.]
