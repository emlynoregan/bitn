Redruth court, 9 July.

Reed was awarded £8-12-6 in a claim for carting wheat for Whinham & McEllister.

Henry Price and another claimed £200 from William Henderson in breach of an agreement to give the plaintiff time to chaff certain stacks of hay and to hold over a summons on condition of the plaintiff’s handing over a policy of insurance on the said hay to the value of £200.  The defendant said he had refused to accept the policy on advice from John Sampson as it offered no security and was thus unacceptable.  Henderson apparently failed to write to Price acquainting him of this fact.  Verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of £5.

Resumed hearing of the police v. Elijah White.

Patrick Murphy said the defendant had stopped him outside Wilkinson’s shop and asked him if he was going to subscribe to Young’s defence.  Refused to give anything and the defendant made use of bad language.  By then a group almost as bad had gathered round.  The defendant called as a witness Abraham Fordham and James Kennedy who said White had used language as bad as the defendant’s.

White was fined 10/- (or 48 hrs.)
