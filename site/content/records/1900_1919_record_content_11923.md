Editorial on Seasonable Hints

The writer urges greater conservation of water.  The writer felt that even in bad years when crops failed, the average farmer should be able to conserve enough water to sustain a few acres of feed for some cows, some fruit and some vegetables and so be able to provide their own food and generate some income from eggs, butter, bacon, cheese, fruit and vegetables.
