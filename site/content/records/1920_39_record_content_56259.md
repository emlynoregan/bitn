Obituary.  William Robert Stewart died at his residence ‘Petherton’ Mt Bryan 9 June aged 59.  He was the husband of Myrtle Stewart.

Mr Stewart had suffered heart trouble, but had been quite well to within a few minutes of his death.  We understand he collapsed while attending to his car radiator preparatory to going to church.  He leaves a widow, born Myrtle Wardle, but no family.

[Born 29 February 1876 Goolwa.]
