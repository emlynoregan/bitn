Senior Citizen of the Year: Ivan Hirschausen

When he first left school he obtained work in the building and painting business.  He spent four years in the Army during WWII.  In 1951 he and his brother Les set up a carrying business, which continues today with his sons.  He has also conducted a wood yard, thus employing many people in the community.  He has an outstanding record as a player and supporter of many local sporting bodies and is a life member of the Burra and the Aberdeen Football Clubs.  He was a player for twenty years.  He was generous with his help in building changing rooms and the grandstand at the Burra Oval and in building the Aberdeen Clubrooms, which have now been donated back to the community for the Burra Community Activities Centre.  He was also a great supporter of the Aberdeen Tennis Club over many years.  He has been notably generous and kind to people less fortunate than himself, especially the elderly and unemployed.  He comes from a family that has lived in Burra for five generations.
