Pam Marlow’s Model of the Burra Mine in about 1860, housed in the Bon Accord Mine Museum, is now nearing completion after some four years of labour.  About half the time was taken in research and development of techniques.  The model is part of the Burra Burra DC’s Jubilee Project.  The model is at a scale of 1:87, which allows for about half a square kilometre to be displayed.  The model shows the mine in its peak of prosperity.  The general landscape has been created from plaster over chicken wire to which individual module boards containing groups of building fit.  This has been done because Pam has lived at Aldgate and Pinnaroo since 1983 and this permits her to work at home.  The model will be open to the public view from 5 October.
