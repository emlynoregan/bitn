The Sheep Sale of 16 October is reported.  Sheep from NSW once walked to Burra by three roads: the peg-line, the middle track and the railway line track â€“ all of which are still used.  In the 1890s yardings of 40-45,000 occurred.  Now numbers are smaller, but still almost 20,000 were yarded on Friday.  The sale went off very well.
