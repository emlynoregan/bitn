Easter.  The annual church festival was held on Easter Monday.  Over 200 persons sat down to tea at the Grammar School, which was crowded with tables three times filled.  The room was decorated with green boughs, artificial flowers and scriptural texts.  Some youths displayed their agility on gymnastic apparatus and other games were played with enthusiasm.  In the evening at the Burra Hotel Assembly Room Rev. Stanton put on an entertainment of music and singing by Mr Dashwood and lady members and readings by himself.  The readings were a mixture of didactic, pathetic and humorous.  Attendance was estimated at c. 400.  Â£6-10-0 was raised for the Female Orphan Home.
