A list of those who gave short speeches is printed.

The oldest past member present was believed to be Mrs Jettner – first President of the Guild.

Performers in the afternoon included:

Mrs Alderson (recitation)

Mrs Humphry & Mrs Miller (duet)

Mrs Satchell nee Mavis Fairchild (two solos)

A long, but incomplete list of those who had some connection with the church and returned for the occasion is printed.

A correction is made to say the Steward’s Report was by Ray Lloyd.
