Inquest on the Market Square Fire.

Held at the Burra Hotel on 8 January with Dr Brummitt as coroner into the destruction by fire of a block of buildings owned by S. Drew & Co.  W. Davey Sen. foreman of the jury.

William Waterhouse - clerk of the National Bank, Kooringa.  Noticed the fire in Doe’s shop at 2 a.m. and alerted P-C Johnson.

John Kennedy - tailor.  Was called by Mrs Snell at c. 2.10 a.m. who said there was a fire.  Ran and called Mr Wade, my employer.  Saw fire in Drew & Co.’s shops.  Ran across to it and met P-C Johnson.  The fire was then in Doe’s shop.  Broke into Mr Geake’s shop and got the books and cash box.  Then climbed onto the verandah roof of Mr Geake’s.  People then began to arrive with water buckets.  No idea of the fire’s origins.  Fire was then confined to Doe’s, next to Geake’s.  Held a bill of sale over the shop fittings and household furniture and was paid the amount of £50 on Saturday after the fire upon putting the bill into execution.  Was paid by cheque from Mr Akhurst, solicitor.  Don’t know how Doe stood financially.

P-C J.W. Johnson.  Mr Waterhouse reported the fire.  Found Doe’s shop on fire: seemingly in the south-west corner and spreading towards the front.  The wind was then from the south-east and Geake’s shop was in danger.  Broke open Geake’s and Lane’s and procured the cash box, safe and books.  Wind then shifted to the north-west and flames travelled along the roofs of the four shops, which were all ablaze within twenty minutes.  Mr McBride and others helped to get the safe from Mr Packard’s office and the things from there and from Duff’s office.  Was of the opinion that the fire originated where there were some marks on the wall caused by some inflammable material.

James Edward Doe - hairdresser.  Left the shop at 9.20 p.m. Friday leaving no light burning.  Had about ten gross of matches in fixtures next to Mr Geake’s.  The contents were insured.  All the matches were tandstickor: did not keep safety matches.

[Doe admitted being in some financial difficulties, but said his creditors were not pressing and he had always satisfied them by part payments and secured renewals.  There was then some discussion about insurance during which it was revealed that some of the stock was insured by his suppliers in their own name - an action he says was unauthorised by him]

Thomas Richardson advanced the money on Saturday to pay the bill of sale after the fire.  Last took stock in September when stock held over liabilities left him £200 to the good.

S.J. McCallum - manager of Mutual Fire Insurance Co. of SA.  Smith and Grant insured the stock of James Doe of Kooringa for £400 in their own name as creditors: a policy last renewed on 20 August 1882.
