Burra Town Council, 23 November.

Minutes of the meeting of 16 November read.

Cr Ridgway moved that such of the minutes as apply to the suspension of works in North Ward be erased on the ground that it would have the effect of rescinding the minute of 16 May which cannot be done except by a motion of which notice has been given.

Minutes carried as amended.

Cr Ridgway referred to a leading article in The Advertiser which said the Commissioner of audit held that the Burra Town Council had got at the Government to the extent of £140.  This was due to a query for the Crown Lands Office whether £217 received by the Council as private subscriptions had been supplemented.  This sum referred to tree planting and paving and the Town Clerk’s explanation had apparently satisfied the Commissioner otherwise they would not have received the Grant-in-Aid in full as would no doubt be reported later in the meeting.  He moved the Town Clerk reply to the article.  Carried.

Cr Ridgway also claimed to have been vilified by Cr Sampson at the ratepayers’ meeting in Redruth.  Cr Sampson had claimed that his efforts alone stopped £150 more being spent on the footpath to Aberdeen and that there was no minute on record as to the ford near Opie’s Hotel.  Cr Symons also spoke disparagingly.  He moved that both Councillors be asked to withdraw their remarks.

A long and stormy discussion ensued.

Cr Symons said he was willing to withdraw any imputations on brother Councillors.

Cr Sampson said that remarks in the Record that £120 more would have been spent on the Aberdeen footpath, but for him, were incorrect.  What he had actually said was: -

‘but for calling the public meeting the Council would have been committed to spending £120 extra’

He had also been under the impression that there was no minute as to the Aberdeen ford.

The matter then dropped.

The Grant-in-Aid of £535-7-11 was announced by the Town Clerk.

A letter from the Crown Lands Office said £18-4-9 had been remitted on account of the overcharge for the constable at Redruth (and was included in the £535-7-11).

The Public Works Committee allow the Town Clerk to define and set out a road towards Baldina from the Smelting Works Stables.

Cr Ridgway withdrew his resignation at the request of Crs Tiver, West & Coglin.

Cr Ridgway gave notice of a motion: -

‘That the road on the western side of the railway be made from the gate to the boundary.’

Resolved that the Council will not in future pay for repairs to the pump in Market Square, but they will be divided between East and West Wards equally.
