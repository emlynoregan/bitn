A Bolt.  Clem Pearce was crossing the creek at the old White Hart Hotel ford when part of a load of loose timber moved and touched the horse which bolted, throwing Mr Pearce and some of the load into the creek.  The horse went around the corner into Morehead Street and then turned left at Fuss Bros. and went up the hill towards the reservoir, past Winnall’s house and was coming down the hill when the reins got tangled in a wheel and pulled the horse up suddenly, pulling it down and capsizing the dray.  In the outcome the only real damage was a broken rein.
