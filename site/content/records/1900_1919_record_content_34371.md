Burra Town Council.

Burra Burra Copper Co. writes saying they have placed the question concerning the purchase of frontages to the creek in Kooringa before their Board.

John Harvey has tendered his resignation as Overseer and Curator of the Cemetery.

A new footbridge is to be erected at the rear of the Burra Hotel.

Cr Walker moved for a fenced plantation in the triangle opposite the Royal Exchange Hotel.

Cr Lane opposed it as it was a bad corner and the enclosure would block Mr Pascoe’s business.

[Mr Pascoe owned a barbershop situated on the south side of the triangle.]

Cr Parks thought it would create a dangerous corner.

Cr Lowe said it would be no more of a block than the Rotunda in Market Square and make no more dangerous a corner.

Cr Walker said the suggestion came from those now opposed and he thought it would make a beauty spot.

Cr Lane admitted it was his idea at first, but after inspection he thought it undesirable.

The motion was lost.

A new fence will be put around the park in Aberdeen, comprising 4 wires and a top rail – 5’ in for the convenience of pedestrians.

[It is not clear what parkland is meant here, but Reed’s block was usually referred to as the Aberdeen Reserve and given the recent debate over Ridgway’s Parkland it is most likely to refer to that.  This was the parkland on the west side of the creek immediately south of the Aberdeen Bridge.]
