Burra News, 2 September

Rev. Stanton and friends organised an entertainment at the Mechanics’ Institute last Monday.

[The program is reviewed.]  The takings were to aid the librarian Mr Cross who, though too infirm to work, managed to keep himself and a wife respectably clothed on an income of £12 per year.  The sum of £4-18-0 was raised.

The Wesleyan Mutual Improvement Association put on an evening’s entertainment on Tuesday with recitations, a debate, a short farce etc.
