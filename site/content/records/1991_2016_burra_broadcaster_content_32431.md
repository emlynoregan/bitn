Real Estate

Alfred Street, Hallett, St Catherine’s Anglican Church building.  $30,000.

[This church had not been used for several years, but it seems a little odd that it was offered for sale here and yet the final closing service was in March 2004.  It had been consecrated in September 1957 on a bitterly cold and snowy day.  See Issue 640, 24 March 2004, page 3 for the closing service that was held after the church had been sold.]
