Burra Town Council, 4 July

The Telephone Dept advises that on reviewing the circumstances it has dropped its claim for damages when a tree being topped broke wires.

T.H. Woollacott was granted permission for extensions at St Joseph’s Convent.

The Council inspected the late Mrs Howell’s property, but will have to do so again, being under a misapprehension about the alignment.

Cr Kellaway moved that five chains of kerbing be done in Graham.  Frank Reed’s offer to supply 2½ chains if he could get the stone from the Council Quarry was accepted.

Trees near Mr Blunt [in St Just St] will be topped.
