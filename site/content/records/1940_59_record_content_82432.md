Burra High School has been reclassified as a Grade 3 school instead of a Grade 4 and it has been feared this might mean the removal of the present headmaster Mr R.G. Jeffery.  As it is thought this would be detrimental to students in mid-year, the Burra Council has written to the Minister of Education urging that Mr Jeffery remain at Burra at least until the end of the year.
