Council Amalgamation.  58 people attended the ‘Have Your Say’ meeting at Robertstown.

Council Chairman Denis Keller outlined the proposal.  The present proposal to merge with the Hallett, Burra Burra and Eudunda Councils followed exhaustive consultations with those councils and also with Saddleworth-Auburn, Clare, Riverton and Morgan in varying combinations.  The perception that Burra and Eudunda’s debt structure was excessively high and unmanageable was totally unfounded.  Burra’s total debt was $793,556, but 58% of that was self-supporting and 42% was met by Council revenue.  It also had cash reserves of $337,000.  Eudunda’s total loan commitments were $355,309.  Its self-servicing loans were $15,339 and $89,168 was funded by Council cash and investments totalled $72,000.  A general show of hands at the meeting favoured the proposal.
