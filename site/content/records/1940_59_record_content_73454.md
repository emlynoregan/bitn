Burra Ratepayers’ Meeting on 2 July attracted only 20 people including the Mayor, Councillors and Town Clerk.  The statement of receipts and expenditures showed the Council had done a good job in completing works and in maintenance and ends the year in a sound financial position.  The Council controls an area of 3,015 acres and within it are 30 miles of district roads and 9 miles of main roads.  The major cost is the maintenance of roads and much effort has been put into sealing these roads to reduce maintenance costs.  This year’s purchase of a small tractor and associated equipment has meant many small jobs have been carried out without having to obtain machinery from the DC.  Tregoning [sic: for Tregony] Street was ripped and regraded.  Railway Terrace was re-surfaced and Thames Street was completed.  Parts of the main roads were also resurfaced.  Council contributes about 26% of the cost of the Burra Fire Station, which is currently in a good state of repair.  The two playgrounds are in good order, thanks to the Burra Progress Association and Mr Reed of Burra North for new equipment.  Only a few trees were planted this year, but some were made available for the Ex-Servicemen’s Association for the ‘Avenue of Memory’.  Council is concerned about noxious weeds in the area and is concentrating on eliminating horehound in certain areas, using expensive sprays.  This aims to gradually eliminate the problem in time.  Sprays have also been used to reduce weeds at the cemetery and efforts there will continue in the next year.

A major item this year was the clearing of the underground drain from the front of Bence’s to the creek in Chapel Street and as this might have been the first clearing since construction, many loads of silt were removed.  Following this there were many complaints of bad odours from the drain, perhaps because the silt used to absorb liquids entering the drain.

Numerous cases of poliomyelitis have been reported through the year and it is to be hoped Burra will be an early inclusion in the itinerary of the Salk Vaccine Caravans.  Children from 6-14 will receive three injections – the second one month after the first and the third seven to twelve months after that.

The Town Hall has had repairs and maintenance and a new convenience provided for the residence.  A special fund set aside for Town Hall improvements has increased to £291 with £70 from the CWA and £50 from Rural Youth.  Two public meetings called to address this matter had to be postponed due to no attendance.  Another will be called in the near future.

The Burra Pictures have been doing well and the debt has now been reduced to below £1,000 and should be written off in about two years – three years ahead of the schedule set in 1950.

Negotiations are under way to obtain new seating for the dress circle.  The estimated cost will be c. £500.  The mid-week screenings were designed to finance the refurnishing of the hall.

‘Following a suggestion from Mr R. Fuss, the Council examined the possibility of removing the shelter shed from the main road to a position in Market Square and upon a decision being made the work was supervised by Mr Fuss and the shed transferred.  This will be painted when the weather permits and should provide some shelter for those persons who travel to and from Burra North by bus.  I extend my thanks to Mr Fuss for his interest in this matter.’

During the year a committee was set up under the chairmanship of H.J. Topsfield to see through the swimming pool project.  This will be an excellent asset to the town in that everyone will be given the opportunity to learn to swim as well as providing healthy recreation.

The War Memorial Oval work has continued and there are plans by the committee for further improvements.

A looming expense for the next year is the repair of the bridges throughout the town, for which material is being obtained.

The ladies convenience near the Fire Station will be enlarged because of increased tourist traffic.

Concern was expressed at the failure of ratepayers in East Ward to nominate a Councillor, which resulted in the added expanse of a supplementary election.

Finance

The debit balance was the lowest it had been since 1949, at £262-5-11.
