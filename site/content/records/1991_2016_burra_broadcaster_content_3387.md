Circus Royale

[An article elaborates on the Circus Royale situation â€“ saying that permission to use the oval was given despite concerns that heavy equipment could cause damage, as it had done in a case several years earlier.  Circus representatives offered a $500 bond and permission was then given, but the management then pulled out.

The article does not explain why.]
