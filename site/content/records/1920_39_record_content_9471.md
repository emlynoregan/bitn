Burra Mine.  Rumours have been afoot about the re-opening of the mine.  While these are considerably exaggerated, A.J & P.A. McBride have retained the services of Mr de Faur who some six years ago had a fair measure of success in treating the dump heap for copper.  Experiments will decide whether it would be economic to treat the dump.  If a means can be found to do this then low grade ore at the mine would be economic.  There are an estimated 250,000 tons of tailings.
