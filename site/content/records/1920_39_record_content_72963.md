Obituary.  Percy W. Clark who died on 7 November was born in Croydon England 19 December 1864 and came to SA with his parents in 1877 on the Forfarshire.  After his education he spent time on sheep stations before joining the Police Force and was stationed in many places and finally at Kooringa.  After two years here he resigned and with Mrs Clark took over the Commercial Hotel from Mrs Harry Vivian.  The couple ran it successfully for 13 years till retiring in 1927 when they took up residence in the home of the late Hon. John Lewis.  He married Miss Emily O. Schrader, a daughter of the late Mr & Mrs Heinrich Schrader a late well-known musical family in Adelaide.  They celebrated their golden wedding on 12 April.  There was no family.  Mr Clark supported sports keenly and was a member of the committee of the Burra racing Club since 1914, being Vice-President in 1926 and Chairman 1927-30 when the club went into recess until 1936.  When it was reconstituted he became the first Chairman of the Company in 1937 until he retired in June 1938 in favour of M.W. Bednall.  In his time on the committee the track was railed in 1919 for £81 and horse stalls worth £120 were erected the same year.  Additions to the totalizator worth £120 were made in 1920.  The biggest race meeting was in 1922 with stakes of £630 and 20 starters in the Burra Cup.
