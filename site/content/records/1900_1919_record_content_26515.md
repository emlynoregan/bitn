Hanson Methodist Church held its harvest thanksgiving services on Sunday 20 March.  Rev. T. Weatherill preached twice and the building was crowded both times.  The usual tea meeting on Good Friday saw a happy contingent arrive from Burra by train.  An open-air meeting was held, the crowd being so great.  Rev. Nield gave an address on local option.  Proceeds amounted to Â£14.
