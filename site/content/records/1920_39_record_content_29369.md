Editorial on the imminent departure of Mr Maurice Collins after a record six years continuous service as Mayor of Burra.  Mr Collins has in that time given his best and Mrs Collins has done a great deal as a ‘silent worker’ assisting her husband.  She has done much to assist the less fortunate in the town.  Now Mr Collins has become a Member of the House of Representatives.  At a meeting of Council on Monday it was decided to give them a public farewell and some small memento in recognition of their service to the town.  The Council decided if it is convenient to have the ceremony on Wednesday evening 30 January.
