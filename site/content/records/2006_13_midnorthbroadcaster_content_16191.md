Peter Brodie writes re Burra Hospital:

The title to Burra Hospital and all its cash and assets has been transferred to Lower North Health Advisory Council; through the efforts of the acting CEO.

A member of the LNHAC told me we would be better off now, which would be as reassuring as knowing that as ‘my home and all my assets and any cash I might have are transferred to somebody else I will be better off’.

A Poem by Max Fatchen written in 1956-57 about The Burra-Hallett Road is printed.
