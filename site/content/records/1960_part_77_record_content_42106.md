Burra Swimming Pool.  There was a pleasing response for the working bee at the pool on Saturday.  While only three adults and ten children were there in the morning, about 32 people arrived in the afternoon.  The first coat (a sealer) was put on in just over four hours.  Unfortunately bad weather prevented further painting on Sunday and this has been postponed till next Sunday.  The opening of the pool is scheduled for the first Saturday in November.  The paint being used is an Epoxy Resin based paint, which should give a smooth finish and is hoped, will not lift with normal use.
