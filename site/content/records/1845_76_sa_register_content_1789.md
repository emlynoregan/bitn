A Traveller writes:

Can you inform me what remuneration has been received by the discoverer of the Burra Burra Mine?  It is currently reported he has received nothing from the ‘Snobs’ and that the ‘Nobs’ gave him only £20 at the time of the discovery.  A subscription by the draymen on the road is reported, but it either was not done or it slipped through someone’s fingers before getting into the right hands.  Are the Burra Burra proprietors too poor (in spirit) to pay him?  All the colony has benefited, so why not make an appeal to the public?  He is an old man and in the usual course of events cannot have more than a few years on earth and those should be comfortable, ‘he should not be left to earn his solitary livelihood in a shepherd’s hut.’
