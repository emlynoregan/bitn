Official Presentation of the Furniture to the Burra Town Council

For many years the furniture in the Town Council Chamber has been anything but a credit to the town.  Some months ago the Mayor made an effort to refurnish the Chamber.  He made a quiet appeal to a number of the old families of the town and district and received a most generous response.  The Chamber is now most handsomely furnished.

Mr A.B. Riggs said it was in honour of the Diamond Jubilee that the furniture had been presented and he has been deputed to hand it over officially to the Council, however, as one of the pioneers of the district, Mr W.G .Hawkes, was present he would ask that gentleman to act in his (A.B. Riggs’) place.

Mr Hawkes said he hardly knew why he was chosen, as he had never been a member of the Council, but he was pleased to say a few words.  He made reference to the photos of the various mayers on the walls and said he ‘would like to see the photographs hung in order, the first Mayor first and so on.’

Mr Hawkes formally presented the furniture to Council and apologised for the absence of L.W. Gebhardt.  The Mayor formally accepted the gifts and thanked the donors.  Crs Jennison and Walsh added their support.  The donors were:

Mayoral Chair	L.W. Gebhardt

Roll-top Desk	W.G. Hawkes
