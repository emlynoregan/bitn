Weather – Floods

A storm brought rain to Burra last Wednesday, but the centre of the storm lay to the east.  Locally only about 16 points fell with another 3 on Thursday.

On Thursday the news from the east was of much greater rains.  Thistlebeds got 160 points and all dams were full.  Redcliffe reported 70 points, Woolgangi 93, Lagoon 94, Koomooloo 30, Poonunda 84 and Princess Royal 67.

Then on Thursday afternoon very black clouds developed and again it looked darker and heavier to the east and south with a great display of thunder and lightning.

Mr Jennison & party were returning from Morgan and about three miles this side of ‘The Gums’ he got bogged hopelessly and they were forced to spend the night in their sedan car.  He walked back through the slush to ‘The Gums’ in the morning and got a team of horses to pull him out.  It all had to be repeated a few miles further on.  The telephone line was down, but on Monday N. Hiles Pearse got through and reported the heaviest fall in April for 50 years.  The homestead recorded 173 points, but the western end of the run got over 3 inches.  The lightning was ferocious and accompanied by hail.  Watercourses came down carrying away miles of fencing.  Dams were flooded and some banks washed away.  Sheep too had been washed away – at least 30 drowned at one dam and overall losses are yet to be counted.  Klaebe’s Creek had never been known to flood, but it carried away huge gums and spread all over the country.  The first fall Thursday had begun at 3 a.m., but it was another in the afternoon that had done all the damage, coming after the 90 points recorded earlier.

He also reported that Baldina Creek had come down through T. McBride’s Redcliffe and parts of Mr Mosey’s country carrying away miles of fencing there.  So great was the flood that at Watson’s 35 miles from Thistlebeds Station the water was running a quarter mile wide and six inches deep.  We believe it is the first time Baldina Creek has reached such a distance.
