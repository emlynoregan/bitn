Kapunda News, 20 June

Having had occasion to travel lately, I must call attention to the abominable state of the Main North Road, about two miles on the Adelaide side of the Light Bridge and also another section of a few hundred yards, two miles closer to Adelaide.  Both are between fences, and cut up to a depth of about two feet, so that it is only with difficulty that any vehicle can be dragged through.  I saw two of the Copper Company’s drays stuck there last week, though with light loads and double teams.  ‘It is strange that while the Willunga, Mount Barker and other roads are metalled throughout, this one should have patches left in a state of nature, although five times more wealth passes over it than is conveyed on the above mentioned roads.’

The mule teams, with a return load of hay, timber, barley, etc. passed through on Saturday evening en route to the Burra.
