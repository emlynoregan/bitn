W.T. Rabbich writes a letter in response to ‘Hypocrisy’ re the charity for the Bulli families where 83 men and boys died in a firedamp explosion.  He points out that at least here families have able-bodied men who can work when work becomes available - the Bulli families have lost their breadwinners.
