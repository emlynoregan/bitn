Burra Amateur Swimming Club has been given permission to use the Mine Pool from A.J. & P.A. McBride.  A shallow area has been fenced off for non-swimmers.  A working bee is called for Saturday to attend to other improvements.  ‘Learn to Swim’ will commence on Saturday 27 February and run to 5 March.  There will be a carnival on opening day.
