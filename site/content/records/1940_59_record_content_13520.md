Burra Town Council

The RSL invitation to the Anzac service was accepted.

Senator P.A. McBride sends on the Minister for the Army’s response to the query on the late advice of casualties.

The Deputy Controller of Lighting Restrictions advises that blackout restrictions have not changed.

Town with more than six lights within 100 miles of the coast must restrict lights to 100 watts and screen them from the sky.

The Mayor took up the issue of one market day per month.  His view was that it was a victory for the city over the country.  The mill was being destroyed at the very time the Government was talking of construction.  It its present state it would now be an eyesore as well as a danger.  The owners should be made to clean up the mess.

Cr Kellaway agreed the destruction was a calamity.  It seemed to him the company would not operate a country mill that was not at a water-head.  He agreed the Council should see the place was completely dismantled.

Cr Bevan said nothing could be done about the stock sales.

Cr Harvey said they had to back the Government with a war to win.

Cr Kellaway did not see it as a great penalty.

Cr Marston said he would agree if he thought one market day a month would achieve the savings in manpower etc., but he believed it would take the same resources to run one large sale as two smaller ones and trucking the sheep would be a problem and he doubted the railway’s capacity.

Cr Harvey agreed with much of that, but disagreed with remarks about handling and suggested Senator McBride and Mr J. Duncan-Hughes be approached for advice.  Carried.

Various routine matters followed.

Various light poles are rotten and the electric Supply Co. will be asked to rectify the matter.
