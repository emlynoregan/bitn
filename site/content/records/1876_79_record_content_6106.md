Council has received a letter from the commissioner re a report from the Hydraulic Engineer. The Engineer approves of the proposal to obtain water from the well near Kooringa and the supply will be ample for this end of the town. He even proposes carrying the pipes on to Aberdeen. This idea is mistaken as Aberdeen already is well supplied from the bon Accord mine which is much nearer and also we believe on a higher level. The estimated cost of the scheme for two standpipes, one in Paxton Square and one in Market Square, is £800. The cost of maintenance is £100 p.a. + 6% of the establishing cost for an annual total of £148. The engineer does not favour private services for what seem to us insufficient reasons. Without this few people would live near enough to the standpipes to dispense with the water cart and this will restrict consumption almost as much as it is now. Once we allow private services consumption will rise and it becomes a remunerative undertaking. One firm in Kooringa alone expected to use £20 worth a year if the pipes were laid on to their business, taking water at 6/- per 1,000 gallons, which is the price for private services at Aberdeen. This should allow the £148 cost to be easily recouped. Then a free trough in Market Square could be easily funded by the Corporation. It would have been better if the Corporation had to deal with one body instead of with SAMA for the well and the Govt. for the pipes. The Govt. should, as at Aberdeen, have secured the rights over the well.
