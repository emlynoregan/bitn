M-C Queale’s evidence is largely repetitive also, but adds information about the alleged robbery from Harold Escott’s room.  Miss Minnie Escott reported this about 7 a.m. on the 17 March, saying he was missing £42, a gold watch, pendant and chain and a safety razor.  Asked Harold how he came to have £42.  £17 was a cheque from Bagot, Shakes & Lewis, £25 was from G. Marshall in Adelaide in payment of a gambling debt (details of which are given).  On the night of the murder Harold said he had ridden the mousy-coloured horse to McCarthy’s.

Mr Winnall appeared for Harold Escott and asked the courtroom be cleared of children.

Herbert Allchurch, Detective, gave parallel evidence about the tracks and the alleged robbery.  Confronted with the findings of the tracker, Harold Escott made no reply.  The police checked his story about the gambling debt, but could find no evidence he had sent the telegrams he had claimed to have.  He then changed his story and said a man called Murphy, who was with him at the races, actually sent the telegrams.  They found Murphy had sent one telegram to Marshall at a hotel.  Harold Escott had said four or five telegrams had been sent to Marshall c/o P.O. Adelaide.

Harold Escott was called, but refused to answer any questions.

The jury found that Mr William Escott Escott’s death on 16 March 1915 ‘was caused by some person outside the office window.  From the evidence placed before the jury we consider that person was Harold Escott.’

Mr Lane committed Harold Escott to stand trial at the next Criminal Sittings in Adelaide.
