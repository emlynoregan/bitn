The Institute Association wrote saying that it was necessary for there to be a ratepayers’ meeting to approve the Council’s takeover of the Institute and the consent of the Institute subscribers or Trustees, before the Institute could be transferred to the Council.

The Association will be informed that a ratepayers’ meeting had been held and A.B. Riggs (Institute Secretary) be written to asking him to call a meeting of the subscribers.

It was resolved not to act on A.B. Riggs suggestion that the Council strike special rate of 1/8 for three years to pay for the Institute.

The Council’s contribution to the Hospital will be £170 for this year.

A minute of appreciation was recorded for the way His Worship had handled the Housing Scheme, which was proving beneficial to Burra.
