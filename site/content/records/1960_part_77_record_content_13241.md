Burra High School.  The Jubilee History continued by R.V. Mueller.

1953

Staff were H.O. Pederick Headmaster, Ivor Burdon, John Deer, Joan Hallewell, Ronald Walker and Helen Inglis. Enrolment was 64.  On 5 May a new bus arrived to convey students from Hallett and intermediate areas.  A lengthy article in the Record called for better co-operation between the Primary and High Schools in organising similar functions and generally for more congenial relations.

1954

Staff: Roy G. Jeffery was Headmaster with Ivor Burdon, John G. Deer, Richard Pillar, Gwendoline Jeffery and Helen Inglis.  SA Governor Sir Robert & Lady George visited during the year.

1955

The staff was unchanged except that Mrs H. Kowald replaced Miss Miller [who is not mentioned as being there in 1954.]  The enrolment was 70.  On 29 August there was a trip to Adelaide with visits to Motteram’s Biscuit Factory, British Tube Mills, Port Adelaide, Outer Harbour and GMH.
