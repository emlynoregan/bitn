Letter.  Anonymous writes complaining of the apathy that prevails re the periodic reviews of Goyder Council’s composition and structure.  Two written submissions and one late submission was a very poor response from 4,000 ratepayers.  By a small majority Council decided not to change anything.  Goyder has one Councillor per 311 ratepayers.  The average across local government is one per 551.  Your response is encouraged by way of a submission by 29 July.
