Redruth Methodist Circuit Paddock comprises 20 acres and was newly fenced last year and was then practically without trees.  Four enclosures have been made: Elm, Jubilee Square, Union Corner and Shady Nook.  On 19 July Remarkable and Aleppo Pines, Sugar Gums and Pepper Trees were planted in the enclosures.
