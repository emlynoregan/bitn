Seaside Trip to Semaphore.  1,300 persons availed themselves of the outing.  The weather was perfect.  Many availed themselves of a trip to the city while there.  Bathing was popular and the stunts of Captain Butler in his aeroplane were much admired.  The 7.30 train arrived on time, but the 8 p.m. train was overloaded and only reached Burra at 2 a.m.

Donors from Burra paid for Captain Butlerâ€™s display.
