Burra Rifle Club held its AGM in the RSL Hall on 6 July.  Elected: Captain, J. Brown; Vice-Captain, T. Brazil; Secretary, R.G. Bernhardt, Treasurer, R. Kellock and Armourer, J.H. Schwier.  Mr A.G. Heinrich was made a life member.  In the year the ‘Darton Cottage Trophy’ was donated by Mr Sid. Williams and won by the club’s oldest shooter Mr Jim Schwier, who is over 70.  The Marksman’s Trophy went to Herb. Byles, who also came second in the Mildura Queen’s Shoot.

Norm Solly of Clare won the Champion of Champions’ Shoot at Auburn in October, where the teams’ event was won by Burra.  In the Union shorts Burra came first in the handicap event and second in the Marksman’s.  We lost two members in the year by transfer to other centres: Dick Pillar and Ivor Burdon.  In the Country Teams’ Championship Burra was not among the winners this year.  In the second match of the year a record of 13 possibles were scored and in all 60 possibles were scored in the year.  In the Queen’s Prize Shoot at the Dean Range Tom Brazil failed by one point to win a Queen’s Badge.  Thanks to Messrs Riggs Bros & George Morgan and to Mr & Mrs Carpenter for the use of their land as a range.  [Report in 1½ pages.]
