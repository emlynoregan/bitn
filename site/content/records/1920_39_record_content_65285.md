Mayor T.H. Woollacott took exception to the statement as expressed in last week’s paper that Sgt Kain was not accorded a farewell.  In particular he objected to the assertion that frequently some folk who had been in the town only five minutes were accorded a blare of trumpets etc.  People who had been in the town twenty years like relatives of the Mayor and Arthur Harris had not received send-offs.  Inspector Kain had only been in the town two years and ‘he did not regard it as part of his duty to organise public farewells to people who had not taken an interest in public affairs.’

‘If residents had friends leaving the town it was up to them to give them a farewell.’

The Council had done its duty and sent Inspector Kain a letter of congratulations on his promotion.

The Councillors generally agreed with the points made by the Mayor.

The Editor says that he also agrees with most of the remarks made by the Mayor, but that he cannot understand why the Mayor should have thought the article referred to himself.  That is beyond the editor’s comprehension.  The Mayor’s name [or position] was not mentioned.  ‘The appeal was and is for a worthy cause and no one wishes the Mayor to have anything to do with it if he does not so desire.’
