Anzac Day Concert

An enthusiastic crowd filled the Burra Town Hall to hear the Burra Sing Australia Choir present an evening of war time songs last Wednesday evening.  The choir was joined by members from Jamestown led by Chris Thomas (son of former Burra Uniting Church minister Malcolm Thomas).

Burra Branch of the Red Cross served tea, coffee and Anzac biscuits in the interval.  Poems with an Anzac theme were read by Jan Tiver and Don Lloyd, while Nan Annells read a letter sent to his mother by a Burra digger in 1915.  Burra choir director John Fuss said he was thrilled by the turnout, the reception received and the interaction with the audience.  This was the choirâ€™s first Anzac Day concert, but people have been asking for another.  The proceeds from ticket sales and donations raised about $850, which is to be donated to Legacy.
