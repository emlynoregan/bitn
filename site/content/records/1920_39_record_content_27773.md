Burra Town Council, 20 August

There was a considerable discussion about whether the Councillors and specifically the Chairman of the Public Works Committee had authority to tell the Overseer what to do between meetings.  The Mayor ruled the Overseer did not have to take orders from Councillors between meetings.  Crs Woollacott & Riggs wanted a definite ruling from Council, but the matter seems to have been dropped with the Mayorâ€™s ruling prevailing.
