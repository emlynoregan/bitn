‘Citizen’ writes praising Mr Pearse’s literary skills in his recent long letter, but finding the argument nonetheless unconvincing.

‘Fairplay’ takes issue with Mr Pearse.  Combining his definition of wowser with his assertion that 98% of Burra people were not at the races, he concludes that Mr Pearse is asserting that 98% of Burra people are a bad lot.  [Actually Mr Pearse said that 98% of those present were not from Burra.]

He doubts if Mr Pearse is broadminded when he suggests boycotting Burra businesses.  Does Mr Pearse give a half holiday on full pay to all his men and maid servants on the day of the races each year?
