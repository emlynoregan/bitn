Burra Town Council, 18 December

The conference with the AWU about wages for employees will be held 12 January.

The Town Clerk reported a sound financial position with the Council at present in credit £443-6-1 with outstanding rates of £563.

The next meeting will be held 15 January.

The conference of Council and Institute Committee resolved that notice for a meeting in the hall be by three days in writing, or in an emergency by permission from the President.

If a collection was taken up the committee is to be entitled to normal hire fees.

The Mayor thought this unreasonable as the patriotic meetings etc. would have to be advertised and it cost money.

The Town Clerk thought the Council would be patriotic enough to reimburse the Mayor for such expenses.

It was resolved the agreement would lie on the table till the next full meeting of Council.
