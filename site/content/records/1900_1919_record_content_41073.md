Cr McBride acknowledged the Hon. J. Lewis’s generosity, but pointed out that the present condition of the property would involve the Council in very great expense.  Perhaps it would be better if it were transferred to a private trust.

The Mayor said in the first place the Council stood to lose £13-£15 p.a. in rates.

Cr Radford said the Council should have a full report from the Inspector and Health Officer to put before Mr Lewis.  Carried.

A letter will be sent to Mr Lewis outlining the Council’s position.
