Editorial on the Town Council and the Waterworks.

The Council is annoyed with the Waterworks Department, but it is behaving unreasonably and petulantly.  Extension after extension has been allowed to the mains even though the Department knew its plans were being disarranged.  The contract with the government is for it to fully equip the works and then to charge interest on the capital to be paid, we believe quarterly in advance.  The first quarter might have been demanded over four months ago, but has not been till now and so the council has been able to collect water rates in advance of payment.

The two things that have angered the councillors now are: -

1.	The slowness in supplying a new engine

2.	The slowness in getting good title to the land on which the shaft stands.

They seem to see injustice everywhere they look.

They need to remember that since the work started the length of the mains, the number of the services, and the consumption of water, have all a good deal more than doubled, so it is no wonder if the engine ordered months ago is insufficient, but the Department has no other use for it and it will be ample for winter needs.  They promise to supply another if it proves insufficient in practice.

As for the other matter the Council are not responsible for the land, they merely rent it from the Government.  Let the Government see to its own title itself.

If a shed is wanted and Council are prepared to pay the interest, then the Government will surely build it.

They have contracted to pay interest on the cost and can be expected to be told the total cost.  That information they have.  Do they really expect to see an itemised account so they can challenge anything deemed excessive?
