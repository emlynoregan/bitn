Kapunda Musical Society’s Mikado season was a great success.  The society now regretfully bids farewell to Mr Richard Walker and Miss Helen Roberts who now leave Kapunda after producing the 1971 production of The Mikado.  The production contributed to many district charities including the Burra & District Swimming Pool.
