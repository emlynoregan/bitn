Mt Bryan Methodist Church.  The foundation stone of the new church was laid 23 January 1937.

For 23 years the church has been an iron building.  Present were: Rev. O.L. Noske of Hallett (Circuit Minister), Rev. W.H. Robinson (Secretary of the SA Methodist Conference), Rev. J.P.H. Tilbrook (Redruth), Rev. A. Dyer (Kooringa), Mr A.D. McDonald MP, Mr L.G. Golding (Architect) and F.M. Pearce & Wall Bros. (Contractors).

Rev. Robinson laid the stone.  The old structure had been intended as a Sunday school and then was also used as a church.  Previous donations and money laid on the stone total Â£150.  The ladies have also raised a healthy amount.  Tea followed in the Mt Bryan Memorial Hall followed by an entertainment, which concluded with the farce A Leg of Mutton.
