Obituary.  Mrs Joe McIntyre formerly of Booborowie died at Port Pirie on 11 September.  She came to Booborowie in 1912 with her mother, two sisters and a brother, as one of the original settlers on the North Booborowie Estate when it was allotted for closer settlement and apart from a brief period lived in Booborowie for the rest of her life.  She married Mr Joe McIntyre and they moved to Yarcowie, but on her motherâ€™s death Mr & Mrs McIntyre moved back to Booborowie and carried on the farm for a number of years.  She was known in Booborowie and district as Lil Jones and was a gifted pianist and vocalist, giving her time at many charitable functions during WWI and was organist for a number of years at the Catholic Church.  With failing health she went to live with her son and daughter in Port Pirie about twelve months ago.  She is survived by a son, Jock and daughter, Margaret as well as by two sisters and five grandchildren.
