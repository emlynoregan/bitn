Burra RSL Wives Group AGM was held on 6 March and was very well attended.  President Mrs Hawker read her report.

For the year their main work had been sewing and knitting for the war effort.  They had also supported Anzac Sports Day.

Secretary Mrs Coverdale also reported.  Membership had risen in the year from 60 to 86 – though quite a number had recently left the district.  Average attendance at meetings was 30.  In the past 13 months they had produced 385 woollen garments, 1,093 handkerchiefs and face washers and 8 bundles of magazines and books.  On Anzac Sports Day when £994 nett profit was realised their share had been £131-18-2.

[Other money raising efforts are detailed.]

During the year 75 parcels had been sent to men in the Fighting Services.

Elected: President, Mrs Hawker; Vice-Presidents, Mesdames H. Jennison & R.L. Steele; Secretary, Mrs A. Coverdale and Treasurer, Mrs R.J. Lloyd.

As an instance of their work, this month’s parcel to headquarters had contained:

19 pairs of socks

11 balaclava caps

1 pullover

70 handkerchiefs

29 face washers

A large number of magazines.
