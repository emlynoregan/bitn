Characteristics of the paper in 1961

In a number of ways it is disappointing.  Coverage extends to Spalding and Riverton, so there is less on Burra, but that is not the principal concern.  Articles frequently fail to identify which town they are about, at least not until you are well into them.  An example is an article headed ‘Swimming Pool Competition Completed,’ which does not indicate it is about Riverton until almost half a column into the report.  Another example informs us that Mrs King has been appointed a Senior Assistant without telling the reader at which school.

Typographical errors with jumbled lines, incorrect spacing or omitted words or lines are all too common.

Most of the news (other than sport) is on page one and photographs are a welcome, if occasional, addition.  Some news extends to other pages, but sport dominates there, though even the sport is not consistently reported.

The CWA gets particularly good coverage and as usual football is extensively reported.  Coverage of other sports is not very consistent; no doubt reflecting the inconsistency of the clubs’ publicity officers.  District Council meetings are generally well covered, but little of the information is of interest at this distance in time.

A sitting Councillor died without comment in the paper.

A welcome feature was the inclusion of some local photographs, though they were a week or two after the event by the time the plates got back for printing.

Note that this summary has generally ignored events reported from Riverton, Spalding or Saddleworth.

Page 1

Entirely devoted to news and photos of local event or people are not uncommon, though somewhat delayed.

Page 2

Advertisements for sales, entertainment, public notices and the like.

Page 3

Often a continuation of page 2 content with some large advertisements.

Pages 4-8

Dominated by advertisements of considerable size.  Most are two columns wide by 3 inches (7.5 cm) in depth or larger.  News here is dominated by sports results.  ‘The Christian Message’ is a regular column of fluctuating size.  CWA news is significant and the activities of the schools get good coverage.  News of any sort rarely exceeds 1½ of the 6 columns.
