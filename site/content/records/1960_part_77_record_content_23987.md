Bowls

Burra hosted the Champion of Champions matches on Saturday.  62 bowlers contested the title.  The final in the rinks competition saw Clare White (Alick Byrne, Max Hand, G. Tilbrook & Ray Leak) defeat Clare Red.  In the singles final Harold Crump of Burra was defeated by Gerry McDermid of Auburn.

Les Phillips Vice-President of Burra Club welcomed guests and A.J. Cornish [perhaps: not very clear] President of the Mid North Association also welcomed contenders.  A fine luncheon was served at the RSL Hall and morning and afternoon teas at the clubhouse.  Last Thursday Harold Crump won the Burra Club Championship for the second year in succession, with Edgar Pietsch as runner-up.  He also skippered the leading rink in the teams’ event – Burra Green, which won the 1964-65 Mid North Association Pennant.
