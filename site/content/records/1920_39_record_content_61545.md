Burra Town Council, Tuesday last.

Burra Electric Supply Co. says it would supply electricity for a 5 h.p. pump under reasonable conditions, but would need first to know what type of pump was contemplated and the amount of water available.  [See more at page 1 discussion.]

Council decided to start digging holes for tree-planting.

Cr Jennison said he hoped if unemployed men were given the job they would be supervised because he was sick and tired of seeing them loafing and wasting the town’s money.

The Mayor thought that while this might apply to one or two Cr Jennison had no right to say all loafed.

Cr Jennison took offence and said ‘he was not at the meeting to be chastised by the Mayor or to see the ratepayers’ money wasted by countenancing the paying of loafers.’

The Mayor said under some schemes men were employed who were not employed on a decent wage, but were expected to work for rags.

Cr Kellaway said some had to be put on who were not fit to do a day’s work.

‘It was all very fine for the ratepayers to say that Council by putting these men on was wasting money; the Council was not.’
