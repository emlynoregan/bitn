Burra Meals on Wheels celebrates its 45th anniversary this year.  There are a declining number of clients due to deaths and relocation to nursing homes.  Frozen meals are supplied to clients at Hallett, Spalding, Booborowie and Andrews when needed, as well as hot meals locally.  Volunteers include Jan Tiver and Betty Thamm with 45 yearsâ€™ service, Judy Eberhard (40 years), Avis Webster and Claire Taylor (30 years) and Celine Stockman and Pauline Venning (20 years).
