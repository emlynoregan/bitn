Weather.  Severe weather conditions around the district early last week brought heavy rain and destructive winds.  Significant damage to homes and property was reported from Spalding, Gulnare and Burra.  What seems likely to have been a low level tornado swept across the district on Monday 21 September.  Bill stockmanâ€™s Glendale property about 10 km west of Burra was struck by it and large gum trees were ripped apart.  The same storm was probably responsible for removing the roof from a house at Spalding.  At Glendale the house, sheds and windmill were spared, but trees were reduced to splinters and others had upper limbs torn off.  Adjacent crops were completely flattened.
