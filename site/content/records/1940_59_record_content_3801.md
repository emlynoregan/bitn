Armistice Day was commemorated at the Memorial yesterday at 11 a.m.  The presence of Flying Officer Goodman, Dr Shortridge RAAF and several men from the recruiting train added prestige.  The Mayor, clergymen, Salvation Army officers and a good number of returned men and members of the 2nd AIF also attended.  The city service was relayed by amplifier, courtesy of H.J.B. Jennison, and afterwards prayers were recited by Rev. Gray.
