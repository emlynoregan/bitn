The Lewis Board of Management met for their final meeting on 10 February.  The Board is being disbanded under the Council’s restructuring of its tourism operations.  Formerly the Lewis Trust, the Board has overseen the restoration and administration of Paxton Square for many years.  In the late 1970s Burra was receiving much favourable comment as a visitor destination, its heritage was acknowledged and the scene was set for a developing tourist industry, but accommodation was a problem.  After a decade of restoration the square set the scene for this type of accommodation and since then many cottage bed and breakfast establishments have been set up in Burra.  The Burra Motor Inn has come on stream as well.  Burra is now well served with accommodation.  The entire Paxton Square is booked out for Easter, when the Riley Car Club will be in residence.  Some of the many involved in the square’s restoration have been Andrew Gebhardt, Bob Lewis, the late Ted Baulderstone and the late Brian Bevan.  Shortly the Burra Burra DC expects to appoint a Tourism Executive Officer to oversee the management of the Council’s Tourism ventures, of which Paxton Square is but one.
