Burra Rangeland Action Project has become the biggest of its kind in the Mid North and has achieved good results in the control of boxthorns, pepper trees, foxes and feral goats.  The benefits to native vegetation are becoming apparent.  Late in February 780 feral goats were culled in a 1,000 square kilometre area from Redbanks to Ulooloo Station.  An intensive fox baiting project would begin this month with three baitings per year.  Burra Rangelands Action Group Chair John Oates said there was great promise in the project.
