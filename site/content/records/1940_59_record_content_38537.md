The Annual Methodist Concert at Mt Bryan is reported in ½ column.

The Kooringa Methodist Young Worshippers League celebrated their anniversary twice this year.  On 22 August the original day set aside proved to be unpleasant and many of the scholars were confined to their beds with colds.  The anniversary was therefore celebrated again on the following Sunday.
