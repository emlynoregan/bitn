Goyder Ratepayers’ Action Group (RAG) is seeking a meeting with the Minister for State and Local Government Relations (Gail Gago) over the Goyder Council’s Draft Annual Business Plan.  Group spokesperson, Helen Szuty said they were seeking discussion concerning the council’s consultation process on the document.  Many issues were discussed at Meetings of Electors and fifty resolutions were carried at the Burra Ward Meeting of Electors, she said.  At last Tuesday’s meeting Councillors spent 40 minutes discussing issues contained in a budget summary and then resolved not to conduct a rate review and to develop a Burra Caravan and Camping Park Plan.

Such a plan already exists as part of a wider plan adopted in 2004.  Council fulfilled the minimum public consultation requirements of the Local Government Act and its own Public Consultation Policy, hearing a presentation on the business plan by herself and Des Woolley.  Ms Szuty said she raised a number of matters which required further explanation for adequate comprehension and recommended that Councillors defer adoption of the Annual Business Plan until issues raised at Meetings of Electors could be included.  There had been no discussion in Council of the matters raised.  Minutes say the presentations were ‘heard’.  The Local Government Act 1999 requires they be ‘considered’.  The RAG remains dissatisfied at the Council’s response.

Council CEO said that the Council had exceeded its own Public Consultation Policy by advertising in four papers and on the Council website with respect to matter.  Copies of the draft Annual Business Plan were available at the Burra & Eudunda offices for 25 days prior to the meeting, rather than the minimum 7 days.  Interested people were invited to attend the council meeting to ask questions and make submissions relating to the plan or to make written submissions relating to it.  No written submissions were received and only two verbal submissions were received at the meeting and those were considered prior to the adoption of the plan.
