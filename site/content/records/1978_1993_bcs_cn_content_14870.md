Burra School & Community News

It has been decided that the paper will continue using volunteers to type it and for setting out.  It will be printed by Trevor Walshaw at the new printery in Commercial Street.  Trevor has generously offered to do this at greatly reduced rates as a community service.  Commercial advertising should be directed to Trevor at his printing office for inclusion as an advertising insert.  Please keep your donations coming in, as without them this community service cannot continue.

SA CWA State Choir will present a Pleasant Sunday Afternoon Concert at St Mary’s Anglican Church in Burra on 30 August.

‘Let’s Not Forget’ is a project commenced over six years ago by members of the community and has just been completed.  It is an obituary index taken from the Burra Record of deaths in the district from 1848 to 1976.  [The pre-1876 references must have come from other sources.]

The Library Board especially acknowledges the contributions made by the late Anne Perry and Shirley Thamm.  In all 12 volunteers recorded over 6,500 entries.  The book is available in a limited edition from the Burra Community Library at $25.
