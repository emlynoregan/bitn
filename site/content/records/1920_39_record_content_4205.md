Obituary.  As feared last week the death by drowning has been confirmed of Donald Kerin employed on Oakvale Station.  On 8 May he went boating on the lagoon â€“ a sheet of water quite a mile across and did not return.  The next morning the paddles were found on the north side of the lagoon and the stern of the boat was sticking up some 200 yards out.  Police were notified and dragging operations began.  M-C North of Kooringa attended.  The body was no recovered till Thursday.  Mr Warnes attended on Friday and decided an inquest was unnecessary, recording a death by drowning.

[Donald John Kerin born Silverton NSW 1891]
