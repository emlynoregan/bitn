The Burra Mine

The road into the Burra Mine has been closed and work is being carried out.  It will be sealed and safety rails and drainage will be part of the upgrade using funds from the State Government Special Local Road Fund.  The State Government will provide $200,000 and the Council $100,000.  The road will be sealed from the entrance on the main road to Morphett’s Engine House and up to the lookout.  Completion of the reconstruction is expected by the end of July with sealing to occur during the warmer months.  Access from the lookout to West Terrace [i.e. West Street] will be closed with detour in place until the end of July.
