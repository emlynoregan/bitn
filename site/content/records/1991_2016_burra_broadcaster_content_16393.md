The centre would explain how the mine worked, how it gave the almost bankrupt colony a sense of well-being and how the town represents the earliest example of transplanted Cornish mining and domestic architecture in Australia.

The application also seeks to link Burra with Federation through the person of Sir William F. Holder, a resident of Burra 1876-91, being Mayor of the town on two occasions and Premier of SA in the 1890s before being elected to the first Federal Government in 1901 and becoming its first Speaker.  The centre would feature a Sir William F. Holder room.
