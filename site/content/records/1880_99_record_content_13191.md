Answers to Correspondents.  A correspondent had clearly asked the penalties in law for interruptions to religious services following the recent letters about the Salvation Army.  The editor cites the Criminal Law Consolidation Act Section 420, which provides for imprisonment for any term not exceeding two years with hard labour.  The Police Act Section 80 provides for a fine of Â£2 for each member of a band playing an instrument after being warned to move on.
