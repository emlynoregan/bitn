Burra on Canvas.  Twenty-two artists displayed their works on Burra at the Burra Hotel on Friday evening.  All except the spritely 75-year-old Miss A. McNamara were amateurs.  The group was welcomed on Thursday by Council Chairman Mr Roy Jeffery.  The works were executed in a variety of media.  The group has such an outing annually and has previously visited Pt McDonnell and the Flinders Ranges (twice).
