Aileen Moorhouse of Burra writes expressing appreciation for the efforts to present the film Breaker Morant.  It was transferred to the Town Hall because of the inclement weather, but the food was wonderful and the presence of Commander James Unkles who explained his attempts to have the cases reviewed was appreciated.
