The Holidays.

Stores were closed for three days last week and one this week with an afternoon also.  The crowds parading the streets on New Yearâ€™s Eve were fairly large, but smaller than for Christmas Eve.

New Year passed of largely without incident and the upsetting of footbridges etc. was almost entirely dispensed with.  The famous pick and shovel bridge [sic] of a few years ago being largely responsible for the present state of affairs.

[But surely pick and shovel bridge should read pick and shovel brigade?]
