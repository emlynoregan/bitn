Burra Slag Extraction Co. has ceased operations to a date to be fixed, due to the low price of copper and the poor returns from the remaining portion of the slagheap.  It is somewhat surprising that the whole heap was not processed as only about a month or two of supply remained.  The machinery will remain as it is thought some use might be made of it in the event of something being done with the Burra Mine property.
