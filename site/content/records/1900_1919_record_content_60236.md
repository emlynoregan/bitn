M.A. Radford writes objecting to some of the phrases used by F.H. Collins in his correction of the cricket report of a ‘draw’ recently.  He finds some phrases rather strange and had one not know the writer to be a ‘sport’ they may have taken offence.  He in turn corrects Collins’s use of ‘Kooringa’ instead of Burra as the team name.
