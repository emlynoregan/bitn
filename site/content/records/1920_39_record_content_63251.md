[Introduction]

Burra was founded in 1845 and has a story of Progress and Achievement only made possible by sheer grit, determination and loyalty of the early pioneers and the residents of the present day.  From mud huts and dugouts in the banks of creeks Burra’s sons went forth to gain fame in Parliament, on the Law Benches of a young state and into unknown Central Australia to found huge sheep stations.

Many once famous mining towns are little better than Ghosts of the past.  Not so Burra.  While clinging to the traditions and proud of their old copper mines, the citizens have turned the district into the greatest sheep and wool centre in SA.

Solidarity is Burra’s watchword.  It is the solidarity of its citizens with their solid support for the commonweal of the town that has been the secret of the town’s success.  It can be seen in the massively built public buildings, churches and bridges and in the solid support of the Empire in the Great War, with hundreds of men who volunteered and the tens of thousands of pounds raised.  In a more modern example of the town’s progressiveness, it did not wait for Government aid to put down bitumen streets.  More recently it was seen in the achievement of the Burra Floral Float.

Town Beautification

When copper was discovered in 1845 the area was part of a sheep run with a creek running through the plains between the hills.  Along the creek were stately gums and in the valley and on the surrounding hills were short mallee, Sheoak, pines, mulga and other trees, excepting for the ‘Bald Hill’ known also as Bank’s Paddock or [later] as the Brewery Paddock.  This massive range was never tree covered.  The mines had a great demand for fuel and in a few years the country was denuded of trees from beyond Black Springs to the south and to Ulooloo in the north.  Burra was a bare, ugly town practically until 1886, when trees were planted either side of the Kooringa-Aberdeen Road and the road named Jubilee Avenue.  Those on the western side did not thrive, but those on the east flourished and now form a pretty drive between the two towns.

From then on trees have been planted at intervals to convert the old town into one of the prettiest in the north.  As a Centenary gesture 600 more trees have been planted to add to the town’s beauty.
