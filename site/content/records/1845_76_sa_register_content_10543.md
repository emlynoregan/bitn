Burra Burra Miners’ & Mechanic’s Institute

The foundation stone was laid on Thursday afternoon (26 February) by Special Magistrate Mr J.W. Macdonald in the presence of about 200 tradesmen and others.  Mr Macdonald, in a few words, showed the advantages of such an institution and the necessity for all classes to combine to reap the benefits and the greater the number assisted, the greater would be the benefit to each individually.  Rev. Matthew Wilson offered a prayer to the Institute’s success.  In the evening there was a tea and speech making.
