District Council of Burra.

W.F. Coon is occupier of Copperhouse lots 13 & 14.

Goldsbrough, Mort are willing to let part of their yards for a pound, but ask how many are needed and what rent is offered.

John Copley of the SAFU store has left the firm and was farewelled on Thursday evening by the staff.  Bert Aldridge presented him with a leather case and travelling rug.  (The rug was a Victorian Retsol rug made at the RS & S Geelong Woollen Mill.)

Burra Reunion.  Each year since 1923 old Burra residents have met annually at the Botanic Gardens, Adelaide, mainly due to the efforts of Mr Charles Forder.  This yearâ€™s meeting is to be on 27 February.
