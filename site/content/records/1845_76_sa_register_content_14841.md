Accidents.  Mr Stewart Sen. was recently out in a cart or on horseback and was later picked up unconscious and unable to recall what had happened.  While he was lying at home in great pain a horse and cart, which had been in charge of his son, came home without a driver.  A search found the young man who had been lying for about two hours suffering from a compound fracture of the leg.  He was carried carefully home and attended to be Mr Wilkinson of Kooringa.  It is understood both sufferers are progressing favourably.
