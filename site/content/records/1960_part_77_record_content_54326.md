Carols in Market Square was held in fine weather and attracted a large gathering.  Compere was Rev. John Stephenson with Mrs J. Oates at the piano and the lessons read by Mrs M. Odgers, Edith Carpenter, Rev. M. Edwards, Rev. Stephenson, Alan Baulderstone and Ian Allen.  The children of St Joseph’s Convent presented the usual tableau.  The Methodist Church Choir rendered pieces from the Cantata Night of Miracles with soloists Mrs Carpenter and Mr Allen Edwards.  Donations for the evening raised $55 for Save the Children Fund.
