Numbering of Issues in 1937.

The year began with Volume 58, Number 1 on 5 January 1937.

And continued to Volume 58, Number 51 on 21 December 1937.

There were however, a number of irregularities:

There was no number 17 in this volume with issue 16 on 20 April & issue 18 on 27 April.

No. 26 was used for both the issue of 22 April and that of 29 April.

No. 43 was used for both the issue of 26 November and that of 2 November, but the number on the paper of 2 November is corrected by hand to 44 in the microfilm version, otherwise No. 44 was not used.
