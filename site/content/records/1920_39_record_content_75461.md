The Frank William Cook Case

Further details are offered from the Adelaide Police Court.

At Clare he obtained petrol by pretending to be a doctor and beyond Burra by making a young man think he was armed.  He was charged with the theft of a coupe worth £250 the property of Alberta Birbeck of Magill Rd Norwood on 5 June.  He said he was making for the NT.  He admitted cutting phone line three times at different stations.  He also admitted cutting fences.  The incident when he pretended to be armed was at Braemar.  He said he didn’t know if his female companion knew the car was stolen, but thought she might have had suspicions.  The article includes two photographs; one of Jimmy James the Black-tracker and the other of James with five of the police involved: M-C Dodrell (Kooringa), Det. Francis, M-C Cunningham (Hallett), Sgt Edington (Redruth) & M-C Martin (Redruth).
