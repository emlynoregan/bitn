Burra Town Council, 1 August

Following a request from the Badminton Club prices will be obtained for fluorescent lighting at the Town Hall.  The club would pay for one or perhaps two, depending on the cost.

The chief Secretary advises that at a conference held last week the Burra Electric Supply Co. set an excessively high price for the purchase of its undertaking, out of all proportion to its value to the Trust and unless the company reconsiders its offer, the Trust could not entertain the question of a supply to Burra.

Mr Hawker will be advised and be asked to meet the Council about this matter.

A letter will be written to the Commissioner of SAR about the continual late running of the Broken Hill express, asking that the timetable be adjusted.
