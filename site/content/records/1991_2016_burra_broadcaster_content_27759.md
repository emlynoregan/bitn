Goyder Council Office Renovations

The renovations to the Council Offices are underway with stage 1 on the north side of the building likely to be completed in June.  The present offices will then move to the north side while the main meeting room area is completed on the south side.  The present doors to the RSL rooms will be filled in and the main entrance to the building will be through the present Council door.  The angled reception desk will then be to the left as you enter with staff offices along the northern wall.  There is a central private interview room and general office area where the Civic Centre was.  A garden bed will be established outside the window facing the creek.  Of the $700,000 to be spent on the project, about $100,000 will be for air conditioning.

[A plan of the project is printed.]
