Kapunda’s loss.  The opening of the Burra railway has reduced the Kapunda line from the main one to a branch.  It reduced Kapunda’s direct communication with the north and has reduced the town to two mails a day to Adelaide.  The local paper protests against the discontinuation of the noon train and wants a direct postal link with Tarlee to maintain proper communications with the north.  A road eastwards to the Murray is another strongly desirable feature to keep the town growing.

Gawler Station.  The local paper is concerned that with the opening of the Burra line passengers for the northern trains must cross a number of tracks to reach them.  This is always dangerous and a light footbridge over the lines is needed before some fatality occurs.

Northern Mails.  The new railway means that mail comes to Kooringa by train and the coaches for the north can leave some hours earlier than previously, getting over a considerable portion of bad road before dark.  26 August was the last day a coach ran between Kapunda and Kooringa.  The last coach was an occasion of some éclat.  The driver, Palmer, one of the most experienced whips was in charge of six in hand and a large number of residents saw them off.  Mr Barnes the guard blew some unusually lively noted on his bugle.  The road was in such a fearful state that the first-class team struggled to get through the mud.  Now it has been replaced by the easy and speedy locomotion by rail.
