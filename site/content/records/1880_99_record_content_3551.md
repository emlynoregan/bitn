Election Meeting at Midwinter’s Baldina Hotel, Tuesday.

Mr Rees and Mr Ridgway took seats at the front and Mr Ward stayed at the back as a spectator.  Mr Rees took credit for the opening of new lands for farming and sympathised with the plight of the eastern plains farmers.  226 persons had petitioned for the land to be opened due to the stoppage of the Burra Mine.  The Hon. A. Blyth, Chief Secretary, said the area was ‘outside the rainfall’ [i.e. beyond Goyder’s Line] and therefore not under the Act for selection.  Mr Rees had moved the lands be opened which implied the abolition of the line of rainfall.  There were now 500 families settled on it.  On 3 Nov. 1873 he had asked for all lands beyond the rainfall line to be included.  Mr Ward had tried to get the water frontages and stony ridges reserved and so leave the land in the hands of the holders of runs.  At this time Mr Ward had prevailed.

Mr Ward frequently interrupted the speaker and finally cried out that this was ‘a b****y lie’ and the speaker was the ‘biggest b****y liar in South Australia’

Rees produced letters from Messrs Carr & Krichauff supporting him and denying Ward had opened the lands.

Mr Ridgway also spoke on reforming the land laws and granting concessions to those who were already on the land.

Mr Ward then came forward and attacked the ‘Burra Record or rag or bug or whatever it was’.  Mr Rees had accused Ward of being in alliance with the pastoral interests - Simms and Chapman - but Ward said he had opened up the lands at Caltowie in 1872 before Rees had even arrived in the colony.

Rees interrupted that he had by then been in the colony 2½ years.  Ward conceded Rees’s role in Baldina, but maintained that he had already seen the elimination of the line of rainfall at Caltowie and in the north.

There was further agitation about a fund being raised to influence the election in favour of manufacturers.  [Mr E. Lipsett’s name was bandied about, but in rather a confused context in the report.]
