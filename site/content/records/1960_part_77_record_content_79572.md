Burra Bowling Club.  The President’s Report for the 1975-76 season is printed in 1⅓ columns.

Neil Hurst was the Club Champion.

Johnny Hill and Kies van der Does won the Championship Pairs.

The January and Easter Open Tournaments were financially successful.  The Associates have again supplied catering arrangements for these tournaments.

The sound financial position of the club has been considerably aided by the success of the bar and thanks go to Clive Neill as bar manager.  The good condition of the greens is a tribute to the work of Edgar Pietsch.
