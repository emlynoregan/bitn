Burra Railway Station.  Restoration work on the station is progressing.  Local tradespersons are carrying out the work.  The work has been financed by a State Government grant.  Roy Taplin is project manager.  He has already ripped up old floorboards and sorted out the plans for electricity and water supply.  Paul Wilson will carry out the re-roofing and Neil Schiller will attend to salt damp problems.  Phil Colls has repainted chimneys and Roy Taplin has worked on the gables in preparation for the roof work.  Volunteers are needed to prepare walls etc. for repainting and to dig holes for floor stumps.  Working bees will be held on Sundays at 9 a.m. commencing on 29 November.
