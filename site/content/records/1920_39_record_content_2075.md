Mrs Charlotte Theeuff of Kooringa was 87 last Friday.  She is one of the oldest colonists, having arrived in SA in 1838 in the Buffalo with her parents Mr & Mrs Press.  She recalls Adelaide of those days quite clearly, when Government House was a weatherboard building.  The family settled at Hindmarsh.  In 1852 she married William Theeuff and went to Mt Lofty, living in a dugout and thence to Sheoak Log and afterwards to Gawler before settling at Government Well at North West Bend, where most of the children were born.  In 1876 they came to Kooringa.  She had 15 children, 11 of whom reached mature years.  After her husband died she took to nursing.  Two sons and six daughters are now alive: James Theeuff of Oulnina Station, Charles Theeuff of Belah Station, Mesdames T. Ford (Kooringa), George Hill, Elisha Ford & T. Drury (Adelaide), Shepherd (Broken Hill) and Miss B. Theeuff who resides with her mother.  William, George and Emma Theeuff died some years ago.
