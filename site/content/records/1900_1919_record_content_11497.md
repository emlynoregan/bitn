Burra Show at Victoria Park on Wednesday

The morning was fine, but heavy cloud gathered by lunch and there was a light shower in the afternoon.

Attendance was lower than expected, but the show was good even if there is room for many improvements.

Agricultural products were only fair due to the poor season.

Dairy produce was about the same as last year.

Poultry was better and the local club members showed some excellent birds.

Draught horse numbers were up and some fine animals were shown.

Cattle filled the yards this year.

Dogs were more numerous than usual.

Sheep were the best ever seen in competition in Burra.

Gebhardt Bros. had not shown for some time, but this year came out in force to win the bulk of the prizes.

T.H. Pearse & Son of ‘The Gums’ were to the front in the aged ram class with two enormous sheep.

Implements were shown in greater numbers than previously.  This year’s flowers and cookery were poor.

The school class showed a falling off.

W.I. Short sent along one of the best collections of vegetables ever seen at a Burra Show and won most of the prizes.

E.J. Harris had a fine lot of bacon and also bulk honey and jams etc.

The sideshows filled an interesting part of the show and there was an evening concert in the Institute.
