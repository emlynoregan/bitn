On Friday Mr & Mrs Stephens held their examinations.  The infant school is conducted by Mrs Stephens, assisted by an intelligent monitor.  Here there are 40 boys and 26 girls.  The pupils displayed quietness and decorum and a proficiency that is testimony to the superiority of the Lancastrian over the old-dame-school system in the management and instruction of the young.  In the evening the upper school was examined by Messrs R.G. Wilkinson, Forder and Stephens and Rev. Davidson in geography, reading, spelling, history, mental arithmetic, etc.  The whole result was most creditable to both teacher and students.  Four of the most advanced pupils assist Mr Stephens as monitors and they were examined separately.  They competed for a prize, but were so evenly matched that it was only with difficulty that the decision was finally in favour of a boy named Williams.  After this Mr Stephens entertained the students with a series of dissolving views.  He also revealed that unknown to him, a group of gentlemen who took an interest in the school, had sent a parcel of books to be distributed as prizes.  The Magistrate Mr McDermott is to be commended for his interest shown in visiting all the examinations of schools in the district, even at some inconvenience to himself.
