Obituary.  Mr Friedrich Schuppan died 21 July at Emu Downs.  He was the last of the original farmer-pioneers, having settled here with his parents in 1870.  Even in his youth he took a keen interest in community affairs.  When the Apoinga DC was formed he was elected a Councillor and served continuously for 25 years.  He had a genial disposition and a great sense of justice.  He took a lively interest in the Lutheran Church.  For a long time he was a lay reader and until his death a trustee and elder of the church.  He was born in Germany 1 January 1852 and emigrated with his parents in the sailing ship Bielefeld, which arrived in Melbourne in February 1859.  They came at once to Pt Adelaide by steamer.  The family went first to Hope valley and then to Modbury for three years.  They then moved to Mt Torrens, Springton and North Rhine, where they stayed till 1870.  Mr Schuppan married Miss Johanna Auguste Eckert on Emu Downs in 1879 and the couple celebrated their golden wedding six years ago.  In the early days he cut the crop with a sickle and scythe.  He saw the bullock wagon give way to first a buggy and then a motor car.  He died aged 83 years six months and leaves a widow and a son and daughter: Mr Ted Schuppan of Emu Downs and Mrs A. Schwart of Waterloo.  His younger daughter was the late Mrs W. Heinrich of Apoinga.  There are 17 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren.
