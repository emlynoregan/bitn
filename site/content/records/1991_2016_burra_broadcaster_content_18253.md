Goyder Council will close its Hallett Office from 1 February.  This has followed the general request of Hallett residents, who wish to utilise the building for other community activities.  Lachie Gosse, Chairman of the Hallett Community Management Committee, said the committeeâ€™s decision was unanimous.  In future dog licence payments, rates etc. can be paid at the Post Office, which is open five days a week, rather than at the Council office, which was open only one day a week.  Tammy Liebhardt, who has staffed the Hallett Office on Fridays, will continue to work at the Burra Office.
