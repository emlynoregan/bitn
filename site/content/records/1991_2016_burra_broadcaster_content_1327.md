The 2nd Annual Antique & Decorators’ Fair drew an estimated 2,000 people to Burra last weekend.  The event was well received by both townsfolk and visitors.  Both the quality and quantity of goods on display was impressive.  Market Day on the banks of the creek brought colour and life to the weekend.  Buskers, stalls and clowns gave a carnival atmosphere to Market Square.  Dave Cotton’s Puppet Theatre entranced the youngsters.  Stallholders reported a good level of interest.  Paul O’Bryan and Billy Dee entertained the late nighters.
