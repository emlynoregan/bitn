J.E. Hogan writes of the sacred nature of Anzac Day and how over the years homage has been paid to the illustrious dead on the day â€“ a feeling only increased by the passing of the years.  How regrettable then that the District Council of Burra Burra should either force or allow its employees to work on Anzac Day.  He calls for an apology to the local branch of the RSL, failing which a public meeting should call on the Council to resign.
