Broken Hill-Burra Barrow Push

Committee member Chris Reed offers some thoughts on strategic considerations for competitors.

Hallett has an all day barbecue planned as part of the push.

The Dampier Salt Shakers are the favourites to win after winning the 1984 and 1985 Burra-Broken Hill races.  The Port Hedland team (formerly the Pilbarrow Pushers) are expected to offer them strong competition.  Other favoured contenders are the Daydream Team (Broken Hill) and the Burra Breathers.
