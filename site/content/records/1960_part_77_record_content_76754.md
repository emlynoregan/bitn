Kooringa Methodist Ladiesâ€™ Guild celebrated its Golden Jubilee in the Church Hall on 17 September, amidst thunder, lightning and squally showers.  A large number of past members returned for the occasion.  Mrs E. Baulderstone made the cake, which was iced by Mrs Zanker and was cut by long-time members Mrs R. Jennison, Mrs Nell Pearce and Mrs Dick Smith.  Eighty-seven-year-old Mrs Kellock, who attended, was a foundation member.  There was a program of entertainment and a delicious afternoon tea.  Among returning members were Essie Morrison, Betty Palmer and Joyce Martin.  Proceeds were $107.61.
