Burra Waterworks.

A deputation of the Mayor, Councillors and leading ratepayers met the Commissioner of Public Works on Wednesday to request that the Burra Waterworks be placed under the control of the Town Council.  The Mayor, P.L. Killicoat, said the offer was to lease the Waterworks for £300 p.a.  Under the old system of rating, which was adopted in Burra, people not connected were not rated.  In 1885 the Government collected £509-19-0 and in 1886 £597-7-0, including £113 from the Locomotive Dept.  The cost of working machinery and measuring the water was £223 p.a.  The Government collected on a large area of vacant land not considered accesible [sic] [assessable?] by the Corporation and they thought they could run the works cheaper than the Government.

Mr Ridgway thought it was hard they had to pay 5% when other parts of the colony paid 2½% and also the present rating system fell unfairly most heavily on the non-consumer and the small consumer.  The Corporation would only charge 1/6 per 1,000 gallons.

Mr Lockyer said the works were initiated by a number of gentlemen who guaranteed the interest on the understanding that the SAR would take water, which it did for a number of years.  (The Commissioner said the water did not suit.)  Well, said Lockyer, they were using it now for locomotive purposes.  When the Government handed the works over they made an excessive valuation of the old works at Aberdeen for which they had been receiving £10 p.a.  The Corporation could work them more cheaply than the Government.

Mr Rounsevell said Burra people felt they had not been treated fairly.  The Locomotive Dept. had not taken the water Mr Lumley of the Public Works Dept had indicated in 1883.  The Government had not kept its contract.  The estimated cost of the works was far in excess of reality.  The price of £420 was far more than the Government need ask for.  The SAR used the water in the past and then suddenly found it unsuitable and yet were now using it again.  It seemed that it was only suitable when the Government ran the Waterworks!

Hon. H.E. Bright supported Mr Rounsevell.

Mr Holder said the old works in Aberdeen had cost about £250, but were put down by the Government at £960.  It was wrong to ask the Corporation to pay interest on losses accrued through bad management.  The extensions had cost no more than £5,000, but were put down at £8,000.  They were prepared to pay 5% on the real cost, but not on £8,000.  The railway claim of unsuitability of water was nonsense; they had drawn water from the same source for years.

The Commissioner of Public Works, Hon. A. Catt, agreed that the Council could run the works more cheaply: ‘The excessive cost of the works had been brought about by their own neglect in allowing the meters and mains to get into disrepair.’

[‘Their’ in this sentence presumably refers to the Council when they were running the works.]
