Cr Bevan suggested one permanent employee be stood down two days a week or one week in four.

Cr Pearce said that up to this night the Council had an overdraft of £1,100 and as there was only £1,400 in rates they could not go on helping the unemployed or the next Council would have no revenue at all.  Prospects for next year were no better.

Cr Bevan said one applicant for relief work owned two houses and rented one.

The Mayor said he knew of only one such case and he was worse off than owners of none.  He is owed £35 in rent and is responsible for the rates on both.

The Mayor thought the tree trimming in Chapel St was severe.  Cr Pearce said the tops could not have been merely trimmed.  Cr Allen did not think it was too severe.

Cr Button said a number of the pines would soon have to come out, as they were rotting at the roots.

Mr Bednall wrote sending an account for £1-1-0 instead of £5-5-0 for the preparation of the transfer of the road to the school, explaining it was because of the benefit to the children.  Received with thanks.

The Mayor complained of people using the Burra Children’s Playground as a toilet, which was pure larrikinism, as there was any amount of conveniences.  He suggested police attention be drawn to the problem.

The Town Clerk said the town conveniences were also much abused.
