Burra Burra DC, 2 March

Following objections from C.P. Thamm and Brian Thamm it was decided not to proceed with the closure of Stronach Street.

Council resolved to borrow $20,000 from the Savings Bank of SA by means of a debenture loan for a period of 5 years at 7.1% p.a. interest.

Council said it was in favour of preserving as many of Burra historic buildings as would interest tourists, but the sum envisaged to resite the chimney and other mine buildings was beyond the Councilâ€™s resources.  It would make available a suitable site and render whatever assistance was possible.

There was a letter from Alexander re the closure of Elphick Street.  Plans to be signed.
