Burra Meals on Wheels stalwarts were among workers acknowledged at a gathering at The Alan Scott Memorial Room at Morphettville Racecourse last month.  As the only foundation members in Burra still with the organisation, Betty Thamm, Anne Finch and Jan Tiver were each presented with a large vase in appreciation of 40 years service.  [Photo.]
