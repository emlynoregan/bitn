The Warren Bonython Memorial Walk will be held on 6 October along the Heysen Trail.  Warren Bonython was a pioneer of the Heysen Trail and patron of the Friends of the Heysen Trail from 1986 till his death in April 2012.  The trail runs 1,200 km from Cape Jervois to the Flinders Ranges.  The idea is to have 1,200 walkers collectively traverse the 1,200 km walk in a single day.  The trail will be divided into 60 sections of between 16 and 30 km in length.  [Details of how to become involved are printed.]
