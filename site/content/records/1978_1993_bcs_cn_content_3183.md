Burra’s 103rd Show [Actually the 88th Show.]

The weather was cold and windy, but the show drew a large crowd with gate takings of c. $2,400.  The show was opened by Mr Grant Andrews, General Secretary of the United Farmers & Stockowners’ Association.  In the pavilions art and needlework were particularly well supported this year, though entries were fewer in Horses-in-Action.  The screening of the silent movie of the lead-up to a sheep sale at Burra in the 1930s was popular.

‘Belle of Burra Burra’ will be repeated on Friday 17 & Saturday 17 October.
