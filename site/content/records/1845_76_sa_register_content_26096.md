Redruth Court, 6 November.

This case ran from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. and created great interest.

On 9 June Mr Keilor was returning to his home from Burra in a German wagon, when he was stopped and robbed of 32/- about two miles from the Mule Camp on The Emu Flat Road.  He was struck on the head and according to his statement lay on the road for some time.  On partially recovering he wet to two houses to enquire the way, but was taken to be intoxicated.  He did not get home till the following morning, although the driverless horses returned home about 9 p.m.  He told others he had been robbed by two Englishmen in two wagons, with a yellow dog.  He and his wife decided not to institute proceedings, but to see if a second attempt would be made.  They went to Burra together on the 17 June and on the way home a man got into their wagon at about the same place as the robbery had occurred.  When the woman screamed and Keilor raised his whip, the intruder escaped.  Keilor was satisfied that the man was Fogarty and, an information having been laid, Fogarty was duly arrested and locked up.  After appearing before a magistrate Fogarty was charged with the robbery of 9 June and the attempted one of the 17 June.

After Keilor’s evidence had been partly heard the case was adjourned and Fogarty released on bail while he sought legal advice and witnesses.  When the case was resumed the case was dismissed by the Magistrate.

The case on 6 November was brought by Fogarty alleging injury due to wrongful arrest and false imprisonment.  He claimed £100 damages.  Mrs Murphy gave evidence that on 9 June Fogarty had driven a spring cart with her, to his own home at about 6 p.m.  Evidence of Keilor’s actions after the first robbery was given by James Parker and his wife (Caroline), George Hare and James Warren.  John G. Heinrich testified to having travelled with Keilor as far as Sod Hut Inn, where they each had two glasses of beer, and afterwards till their roads diverged.  He said Keilor was perfectly sober then.  Keilor and his wife gave the same evidence as at the former trial.

The magistrate ordered a nonsuit, with each party to pay his own costs.
