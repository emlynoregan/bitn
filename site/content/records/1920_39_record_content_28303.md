Mr & Mrs H. Garfield James were given a farewell social in the Methodist Lecture Hall last Monday evening before they left the town.  Mr James had been in the town for 16 years and had been a strong supporter of the church.  (His father was Rev. W.F. James.)  Mrs James was the daughter of Mr John Harry.  Mr James had served the firm of Drew & Crewes during his time in Burra and was thanked by E.W. Crewes for his service to the firm.  John Drew on behalf of the Sunday school spoke more directly to Master Alfred James.  Mr Jamesâ€™ successor will be Mr Finlayson.  Presentations were made.
