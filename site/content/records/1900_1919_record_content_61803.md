Burra Town Council.  Following approaches from the Peace Day Committee the Council resolved:

To hand over the £30 it had in hand from 1915 as a Memorial Committee and to allow the Peace Day Committee to handle the matter.

To inspect the proposed site on 20 September at 10.30.

In response to the Burra Football Association’s concerns about the state of Victoria Park it was decided to inspect it on 20 September at 10 a.m. when the Cricket Club’s concerns will also be considered.

There was debate over a new assessment with Cr McBride desiring an outside evaluator, but finally the old assessment was adopted.

Letters from W. March and E. Hopkins will be referred to the Council solicitor for advice on prosecution.  [Concerning the destruction of trees.]
