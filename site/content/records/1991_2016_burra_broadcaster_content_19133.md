Mt Cone Conservation Reserve

The Minister of the Environment Mrs Dorothy Kotz officially announced last week that 464 ha north of Mt Cone had been bought under the Natural Heritage Trust National Reserve System Program for almost $420,000.  The reserve contains a significant proportion of tussock grassland, 99% of which has disappeared from SA and about 40 other plant species.  The area had been farmed by the Gebhardt family for almost a century.
