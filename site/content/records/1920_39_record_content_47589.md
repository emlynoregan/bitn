Burra Town Council, 4 September

M.W. Bednall forwarded £21-9-6 as part proceeds from the sale of unclaimed allotments with £15 to come.

Thomason & Field applied for a petrol pump licence.  (Decision held over.)

The horse offered by C.E. Thomson proved unsuitable.

A number of minor works were approved.

Consideration of employment for the unemployed as suggested by the Unemployment Dept. was referred to the Finance Committee.

That the area referred to in (1) be marked in white paint.

That a light on the rotunda illuminate the area in (1).

A licensed vehicle stand be made on the west side of the rotunda.

That the above be effective at once.

It was also resolved that vehicles over 156” long be banned from parking between the National Bank and the Roman Catholic Church gate.
