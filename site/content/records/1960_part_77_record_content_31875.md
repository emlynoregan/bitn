Cricket.  Mokota Association

North Booborowie 6 for 165 defeated Burra Footballers 130

Hallett 145 defeated Leighton 117

Spalding 5 for 17 [sic] defeated Koonaburra 152.  [Clearly an error, but the runs cited only total 153 so the truth is not easily discernible.]

Hallett 145 defeated Leighton 117.
