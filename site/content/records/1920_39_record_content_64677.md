Memories of Burra by Elizabeth A. Ward

The Burra Smelting Works

I suppose there are few people remaining in Burra who can remember the smelting works in their glory, or as the men would say, “going full blast”.  I saw them once when I was a child about six years of age.  I was taken by a party of ladies who had a permit for the visit and the whole scene left such an impression on my mind that I have never forgotten it.  It was on a Saturday night.  The vast piles of buildings lit up by the glare of the furnaces stands out clearly.  These were at the Redruth end.  Confronted by a great wall we entered by a great doorway.  Then we passed through an immense courtyard paved with cobblestones.

At another opening an official met us and conducted us to a place of safety.  We were now in a vast building.  Two wooden galleries, an upper and lower ran though the building.  These were supported by pillars of masonry.  Two large platforms divided by a road were in the centre of the building.  On these were the furnaces and their brilliant glare and heat was intense.  Great clouds of steam and smoke flared and rose in colours streaked with black and grey at one place, and a great smell of sulphur.  Men moved about, their shadows showing up like giants dangerously close.  Chains clanked and wheels creaked and hammers pounded.  The back of the building was in darkness like a vast cavern.  Throughout all there came a sound of breathing from the huge bellows.  One of the furnaces was being opened as we passed and a stream of molten metal poured out into some receptacle.  Men stood at either side with long pieces of iron shaped like an inverted letter ‘L’.  With these they pulled out pieces of unmelted ore and slag.  Others ladled out this molten metal with big ladles with very long handles into iron pots like old fashioned wash hand bowls.  These also had long handles.  These were carried to the moulding floors.  Here were beds of wet sand on which impressions of slabs were found.  The hot metal was poured into these forming when cold slabs about the size and shape of tombstones.  They were, of a dark green colour, smooth on one side, on the other shiny and ribbly in appearance.

The whole scene was intensely weird.  Many years afterwards I had the opportunity of seeing a very large and properly illustrated copy of Dante’s Inferno.  The pictures of that awful book vividly recalled my visit to the smelting works.  It was a strange place to take a little child into.  Little did those ladies think that a little girl standing so quietly by was taking it all in and that after a lapse of nearly seventy years would be able to describe the visit.  It was all so unusual and fearsome, but I am glad now of the memory.  We passed out at the Burra end.  The old chimney was smoking and a great glare was coming from the Works.  As we came down the hill the lights of the township were showing in the distance.

Turn back! Oh turn back

Old time in thy flight

Make me a child again

Just for tonight.
