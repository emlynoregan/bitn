The Mayor said he had neglected to mention the removal of the railway fence and the straightening of the road near the Bon Accord Hotel.  He said he had done his best and thrown his weight behind the patriotic efforts.  The Council had worked as a happy family with some differences of opinion, but no bickering.  The town was badly lighted, but it could not be improved without raising the rate.  Dead Man’s Bridge was an eyesore and a danger and he would like to see the road straightened.
