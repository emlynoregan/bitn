George Ramhit, cook at Mt Bryan Station was charged by Frederick Page, labourer, with assault.  After evidence of assault by both parties and a claim from Ramhit that his assault was in self defence, the court rules that it was indeed self defence, but he had used unnecessary violence and fined Ramhit £1 + 15/- costs.
