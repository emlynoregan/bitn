Burra National Trust has decided to sell the old Burra Record printing press for scrap.  It has lain in pieces at the Bon Accord Museum for some 14 years and cannot be restored.  An identical working press is on display at the Pinnaroo Printing Museum.  [Photo.]

[This must have been both disappointing and annoying for many people in light of what efforts had been made to secure the press in 1988-89.  This is reported in the Burra School & Community News of 24 May 1989

Burra Printing Press

Last year the appeal to raise funds for the purchase of the Burra Record printing equipment and other relics saw about $4,200 raised â€“ a shortfall of $1,800.  Recently the Advertiser Newspaper Limited donated $1,800, which has been received on behalf of the town by the National Trust Chairperson Maureen Wright to complete this important historical purchase and secure the collection for Burra.  The donation followed a suggestion from Burra resident David Bunney that the Advertiser be approached.  It is hoped some time in the future to set it up and have it working again.  It is certainly a valuable collection.]
