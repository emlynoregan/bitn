Frank Treloar has decided to move to Adelaide to be nearer his family, in part due to the continuing ill health of his wife.  49 years ago he was appointed manager of Gum Creek Station, which he retained for 18 years before moving into Burra.  For 27 years Mr Treloar was DC Hanson Clerk and Secretary of the Burra Hospital as well as being active in all town movements.
