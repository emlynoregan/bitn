Mongolata.  A party organised for 18 December went off quite well with games and items interspersed, but somehow Father Christmas failed to appear to the great regret of the younger folk.  Things improved with the arrival of the Salvation Army on the following night and this time Father Christmas did appear and distributed presents to each child, handing out a useful gift, a bag of sweets and a balloon.
