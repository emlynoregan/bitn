‘Anti-Monopoly’ writes complaining of the operation of the Land Boards in allotting blocks of land to applicants.  Recently with 70 applicants for 8 blocks in the Hundred of King, two of which, consisting of 43,072 acres, went to Messrs T.W. Warnes and J.F. Warnes, sons of a member of the board.

The editor suggests it may be due to clause 36 of the Crown Lands Amendment Act 1889 which gives preference to those who would personally reside on the land for at least six months in every year.  If it is not the reason the correspondent has a remedy.
