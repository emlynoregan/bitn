Burra Town Council, 7 May

Highways & Local Government Dept. approves the transfer of surplus funds from Smelts Road, Young Street and Ayers Street to Railway Terrace.

SA Government Tourist Bureau advises the Minister has approved a subsidy of up to £1,500 for the Burra Swimming Pool.

The Manager of the Savings Bank of SA sought approval for the removal of a large pine tree in front of the Bank’s residence in Thames Street.  Approval granted and other trees will be planted in that vicinity.

The footbridge near the Bowling Club will have its decking repaired and the footpaths approaching it will be gravelled.

A letter of appreciation will be sent to Mr R. Fuss for his advice and assistance in moving the shelter shed to Market Square.

Cr Lehmann moved that shrubs near the shelter shed be trimmed to a smaller size.

Cr carpenter reported on inspections and suggestions about the swing bridges.
