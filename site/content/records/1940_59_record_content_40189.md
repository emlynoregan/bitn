Clay Deposit.  A large deposit of kaolin has been opened by Messrs Morrison Bros. on the property known as Motherall’s in the Hundred of King some 18 miles east of Burra.  12 months ago while fossicking for gold they sent a sample to the Mines Department and Mr Dickenson, Director of Mines, reports it was an off-white clay which would burn buff at 1,100°C.  The Littlehampton Brick Co. has ordered 41 tons of it and it is possible there will be other users interested in pottery and fire bricks.  If, as rumoured, acid-proof brocks can be made from it, this material is much sought after.  The clay resembles chalk, is free of grit and has no smell.  Morrison Bros. say when pulverised and mixed with water it makes a splendid whitewash and thus could be excellent as a base for kalsomine etc.   Rail transport is holding up deliveries.  As well as hundreds of tons of white clay there is a deposit of yellow clay suitable for ordinary bricks.
