Weather.  Good rains have fallen in the last week.  The total of 149 points brings the monthly total so far to 231 points.  It was widespread over the agricultural areas, but did not extend to the east.  While it was raining heavily here on Tuesday night and Wednesday, eastern residents were being choked by severe dust storms that rained gravel onto roofs that sounded like heavy rain and great damage was done to the surviving feed.  Snow fell on Tuesday at Mt Bryan during the storm.
