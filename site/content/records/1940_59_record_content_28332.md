Burra-Adelaide Cycling Classic

The first Burra-Adelaide race to be contested since 1940 was held last Saturday.  Sixty-six competitors were seen off by a large crowd of Burra residents.  This year the first prize was Â£45 and entrants ranged from 17 years of age to 57.  The youngest, B. Feeney, had a 25 minute start (the limit was 45 minutes).  T. Reynolds was 57 and had a 35 minute start.  Mr Peter Borowski of Burra used to compete in the event as a junior rider.  The Mayor, H.J.B. Jennison welcomed riders and officials and wished them well.  Mr T. Reynolds had only missed one race since the event started in 1910 and that was the 1921 contest.  His Worship saw off the first group.

After a 45 minute wait the scratch men were called to the line: Dick Humphrys, Keith Thurgood & J. Conyers.  The best time was ultimately recorded by Keith Thurgood and on handicap the winner was S.A. Cameron, who had a start of 39 minutes.
