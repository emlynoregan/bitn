Opening of the Monster Copper Mine

A few days ago we said the SA Mining Assoc. had sent a party of men to the Burra Creek to commence operations at what is now generally known as the Monster Copper Mine.  A gentleman formerly connected with the paper has since visited the site and brings back more flattering accounts of the prospects of success that those hitherto received.

Last Saturday he found four dray loads of ore had already been sent to Adelaide and ten loads were piled up ready to be sent.  Eight men only had raised this in a single week.

The face of the hill has been opened in three places:

About 100-150 yards above the ‘bunch of ore’ giving rise to the Monster Mine.

At the extreme lower end of that bunch of ore on the surface.

300 to 400 yards below it, near the base of the hill.

At the first site a square hole 4 or 5 ft in width found ore near the surface and further development was deferred.

At the second site a rich start par excellence resulted in an opening some 16 ft wide and 6 ft deep was made and in following the ore this increased to 21 ft wide and no depth limit has yet been found.

The third site had an opening some 15 ft wide by 5 ft deep and from it a mass of ore equal in quality to the Monster Lode has already been raised.

The limits to these ore bodies have not yet been ascertained.

Another batch of miners has been sent up and it is expected they will be able to produce 60-80 tons of ore per week for some time to come.

This success immediately poses the problem of transporting the ore to Adelaide and then of its shipment to England.  The amount predicted above would require about 60 teams of bullocks (at 8 per team) to move the ore to Adelaide.  Then there is the need to find shipping to England.

A spring of first rate water has been found only a few hundred yards from the mine, with an excellent site for a township adjacent.

The Directors should lose no time in laying out a town and administering to the comforts of the men, for in this area the heat is as intense as the employment is exhausting.

The quality of the ore may be inspected at Mr Stocks’s stores.  The shareholders of the Mining Assoc. have good reason to congratulate themselves on their prospects of success.
