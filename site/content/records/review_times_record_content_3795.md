Terowie & Hallett Institutes may face closure.  This will be discussed at the next Hallett DC meeting.  District Clerk Mrs H. Blieschke said there was a move by the Libraries Board of SA to phase out book borrowing from Institutes.  Borrowers could be serviced through public libraries at Peterborough and Burra.  Hallett had 58 subscribers.  The Executive Director of the Institutes Association Mr R. Broad said the phasing out was part of a 1978 agreement to gradually dissolve town institutes by 1988.  In 1978 there were 165 institutes in SA, but numbers have since dwindled.  The buildings that once housed institutes would probably be handed over to local government authorities.
