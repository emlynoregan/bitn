F.M. Jefferies writes expressing deep regret at the way the Burra Burra DC has dismissed the overseer after 32 years of faithful service.  He does not accept their reasons for doing so – namely the need for a younger man and the lack of a certificate.

Mr Alex Burton has a wealth of experience and practical abilities and has never been absent from work for one day through sickness or other reasons.  He has saved the Council thousands of pounds because (even without a certificate) he had the ability to repair engines of trucks, tractors, and other equipment.  He is entitled to better treatment.  ‘I understand Mr Burton was regarded by the Inspector of Highways as one of the most efficient overseers in the Northern area.’
