BCS.  The Kooringa building is receiving a facelift to the value of $90,000 from the Department of Housing and Construction.  Walls and window frames will be renovated.  The building will also be re-painted, including the roof.  A stone mason is currently at work.  In the longer term it is planned to re-roof the building in about 1991.
