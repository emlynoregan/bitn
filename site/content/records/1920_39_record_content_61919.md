[There are several errors in this list:

*In November 1888 P.L. Killicoat was elected unopposed for 1889, but on seeing the election results he immediately resigned, citing personal reasons.  In fact it seems he was unwilling to work with Cr Sampson.  As a result of nominations called for 24 December 1888 F.W. Holder was elected unopposed and served as Mayor for 1889.

†In November 1901 Alexander Harris was elected unopposed for 1902, but he died on 25 December 1901 without attending a meeting of Council.  E.W. Crewes was elected unopposed to replace him on 10 January 1902 and served as Mayor for 1902

‡Given that Alexander Harris had died 25 December 1901, this is clearly wrong.  J. Sampson Jnr was elected in November 1902 to serve as Mayor for 1903

§A new Act of Parliament, effective 2 November 1934 changed the Municipal Year from a calendar year to run from July to June.  The life of the 1934 Council was extended to the 1st Saturday in July 1935 so the last three entries should be:	1934-35	T.H. Woollacott

1935-36	T.H. Woollacott

1936-37	T.H. Woollacott]
