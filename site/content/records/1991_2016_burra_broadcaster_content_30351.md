St Johns & Burra

St John First Aid personnel in their black uniforms have been servicing the community with first aid for more than thirty years.  In recent times they have split from SA Ambulance service (in green uniforms), but have continued with first aid courses and equipment. Their continued presence in Burra will be decided at a meeting to be held 2 March.  Burraâ€™s Gail Edwards has been very involved in St John work, but has had to cut back.  The continuation of a cadet unit requires a suitable number of adult supervisors.
