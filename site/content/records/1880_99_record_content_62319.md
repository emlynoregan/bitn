Fire.  At 2 a.m. on Saturday Mr Lapidge, the Waterworks engineer, was roused by Mr P. Roach who resides close to the Waterworks, and told that the place was on fire.  Knowing where to put his hands on the necessary appliance and having the full force of the water he was able to save the building.  When they arrived the blaze was curling almost over the engine-house building and it was impossible to save any of the woodheap.  The hose was kept playing on the roof inside the building.  The large gate was thrown open to assist in protecting the workshop and tying an old coat over his head Mr Lapidge rushed through the flames to unlock the street gate and pull the works cart from its shed which was by then ablaze.  By this Mr Roach had roused Messrs Gurry and Lawler who worked hard to save the other buildings.  Mr Davis then arrived and was sent to inform the police and the Mayor.  By dawn nothing but glowing cinders remained of the woodheap and water had to be applied till about noon to put out all traces.  A high north wind made it all the more dangerous.  The only damage to the building was a scorched facia board.  About 16 tons of wood was lost and more had to be purchased for the engine to start on Saturday.  Pumping had stopped on Friday at 12 oâ€™clock so there was a lapse of about 12 hours from the stopping of the engine to the starting of the fire the origin of which is a complete mystery.
