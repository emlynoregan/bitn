The Burra National Trust will have guides to take people around the Trustâ€™s Malowen Lowarth Cottage (Hollyhock Garden) over the October long weekend.  The cottage is one of the 1850s cottages in Paxton Square on the eastern side of Paxton Square [Kingston Street].  The cottage committee had spent many Thursday mornings preparing the three-roomed cottage.  It features authentic polished-earth floors and canvas ceilings in two of the rooms.  It is furnished with articles from the mid nineteenth century.  About 200 items are used in the display.  It is intended to set up a cottage garden with a vegetable patch and flower bed of marigolds, daisies and geraniums.
