Mt Bryan FFCF ended their 1945 drive for funds at an evening at the hall on Friday 13 April.  This year’s drive raised £265-16-6, which was an increase of about £50 on last year’s effort.

The event was also held in conjunction with a social to farewell Flight Sergeant Bob Collins, who was home on leave.  Mrs M. Gebhardt made the presentation on behalf of the Cupboard Fund and Eric Murray the one on behalf of the district.   Mr T. Quinn spoke feeling about the contribution of our boys to the war effort and Flt-Sgt Collins suitably responded.

During the evening a two minute silence was observed in respect of the later President Roosevelt.  After that Mrs Max Pearce sang the American National Anthem most majestically, the audience remaining standing throughout.
