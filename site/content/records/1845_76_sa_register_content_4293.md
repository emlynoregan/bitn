Meteorological Observations at Kooringa.

For the month of January 1850 temperatures taken at 10 a.m., noon and 3 & 4 p.m. are printed, together with barometric readings at 10 a.m.  The readings were taken by Adie’s patent sympiesometer* at the Smelting Works at an elevation of 1,500 ft.  The average of the temperature readings outlined above for the month was 76.66°F.

The article described the passage of a marked cold front on 28 January.  Before the front the town experienced a sultry hot northwest wind.  At the approach of the front there were enormous columns of dust in an immense whirlwind accompanied by thunder and lightning.  Darkness, greater than that of a total eclipse descended on the town and then, after about a quarter of an hour the southerly wind prevailed and a refreshing shower of rain fell.

[*Sympiesometer: a barometer in which there is gas above the column of liquid in the tube, so that the pressure of the atmosphere act against the pressure of both the liquid and the gas, a thermometer being attached for the correction of the readings.  Obsolete.]
