Poor lambing rates have been blamed on foxes, which in turn have been blamed on myxomatosis.  The success of myxomatosis has caused a fox plague.  In Victoria pastoralists say foxes are worse than for many years.  Locally lambing rates of 50% or less are being blamed on the same cause.  Some farmers are claiming a rate of only 30%.  One man claims to have killed 40 foxes in three weeks and others claim 50 in the same period.  At Mt Bryan and Mt Bryan East poultry has to be very securely locked up at night or foxes take them.
