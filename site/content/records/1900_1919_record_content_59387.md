Ethel Langley writes contradicting Mr McBride’s assertion she is an uncertificated nurse: she holds the 3-year’s certificate of a county hospital in England.

Mr McBride contacted the paper and said he had not referred to Nurse Langley as unqualified and the report was in error.

The paper regrets the apparent misunderstanding of its reporter.
