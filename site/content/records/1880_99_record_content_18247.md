Entertainment.  John Roach’s Ballad Concert and Entertainment in aid of the Children’s Hospital last Monday attracted a full house with some being turned away. The first item was the ‘Ten Little Nigger Boys’: a well-trained troupe of youngsters who later returned to sing ‘Little Brown Jug’ and again after interval.  The night raised over £15.
