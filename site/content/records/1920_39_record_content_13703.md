The North-Eastern Plains are in a bad way with sheep dying in all directions from lack of food and frosty nights.  The worst area is Nackara to Olary which has had no rain of value for 3Â½ years.  No rabbits are to be seen, having been starved out.  Lambing rates are c.30%.  Around Cockburn things are better; summer rains having helped and lambing rates there are very good.  To the south though one pastoralist lost 1,000 newly shorn sheep in one night due to severe frost.  Ewes are also seen bogged in dried out dams with lambs being attacked by crows.
