H.O. Pederick, headmaster of Burra School, asked the Council to construct a road from the school to the top of the hill, as the existing road was too rough for the school bus and the pick-up point by the Drill Hall was too far away for supervision.  He asked for the repair of the road from the school to the saleyards.  The Council will hold an inspection.
