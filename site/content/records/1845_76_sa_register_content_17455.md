Kooringa News, 18 April

Scarlatina and whooping cough are very prevalent and several have fallen victim to the former.

Fire is reported to have destroyed a number of huts and stockyards on Mr McCulloch’s run at Gottlieb’s Wells.

On Friday Burra and Clare Cricket Clubs played a match on the flat at Aberdeen.  Burra 54 defeated Clare 35 & 18.  An eight a side scratch match followed and was also won by Burra.  They all then went to the Miners’ Arms for dinner.

Miners are keeping a careful watch on the strike at Wallaroo.  Many have been there and returned unable to obtain wages sufficient to compensate them for the annoyance they had to suffer from the captain who a short time ago was one of themselves.
