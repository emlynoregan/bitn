Roger Cross writes reminding readers of the sacrifice of 22 Burra soldiers at the capture of Villers-Bretonneux on 25 April 1918 and listing their names as Arnold, Bishop, Collins, Cruickshank, Dew, Dearlove, Dixon, Gallagher, Gilbert, Gillett, Green, Howells, Kelly, Kemble, Lea, [sic: for Lee] Lacey, Muller, Pederson, Riggs, Rogers, Sommerville & Tiver.  (80 other young men of Burra district lost their lives on service during WWI.)

[This is an odd claim because their dates of death and sometimes places are widely different.

In 2014 Roger Cross researched and initiated an addition to the Burra War Memorial on which the information given is more reliable:

Mike & Lynn Wildash have left the Burra Newsagency and Brett & Jean have taken over.

Anzac Day prompted a short article by Michelle Osborn on the Burra Cheer-up Society and on Pte George Albert Williams.  The Cheer-up Society was made up principally of young women who provided farewell socials for departing volunteers and rousing patriotic welcomes on their return.  It also raised money to aid soldiers and for the Adelaide Cheer-up Hut as well as providing woollen comforts, Christmas boxes etc. for the troops.  When the town’s Coronation Band ceased to function due to its members largely volunteering for war service, the women formed the Cheer-up Ladies’ Band to provide patriotic music in Burra and elsewhere in SA for fund-raising events and at the station to welcome returning men.
