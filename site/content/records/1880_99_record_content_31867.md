Charles Woodruff & John Martin were charged with receiving bran, pollard and chaff stolen from Dempsey, Wilkinson and Sandland, auctioneers.  William Sandland gave evidence of losing the goods over eight weeks.  A boy named Thomas Highet was looking after it.  The total value of lost material was c. £7: the charge relates to a small quantity taken on March 4 and valued at 8d - taken from the stables at the Commercial Hotel.

Thomas Highet (16) said that nothing took place between himself and Woodruff.  He gave Jack Martin some bran, chaff and pollard on 4 March.  ‘Have given it to him five or six times, about three or four times a week for three or four weeks.’  [This doesn’t seem to make much sense.]  ‘Did not promise me anything for it - he has given me drinks.’

Woodruff used to ask me to give him a bit of chaff.  The lot on 4 March was c. half a bag.

Woodruff gave evidence on behalf of himself and the boy Martin who was under his charge.  He claimed he only got musty stuff that would have been thrown out.

Woodruff was sentenced to three months and Martin was discharged.
