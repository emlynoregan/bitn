BCS.  Interschool sports between Eudunda, Kapunda and Burra schools were held at Eudunda.  The BCS sports day was held on 28 April.  The lack of enthusiastic involvement by many students indicated the need for activities to involve the many not taking part in championship athletic events.  Steele House was the clear winner.
