CWA

Mrs I.J. Warnes convened a meeting in the hall adjoining the show office on 5 November.  The hall was crowded.  Mrs T.R. Bowman of Adelaide also attended to give advice.  She was President of the National Council of Women in SA and could speak of the great benefits the CWA had brought to Queensland and NSW.  She had approached Mrs Warnes at the suggestion of the heads of the organisation in NSW & Queensland.  Preparatory discussion with clergy, philanthropic workers and prominent people of the district had followed.  Mrs Bowman outlined the aims of the CWA:

Improve the welfare and conditions of country women and children.

Draw together country women, girls and children.

Bring opportunities for recreation.

Encourage study of local municipal and district affairs in a wise and kindly spirit.

Promote educational facilities in the country.

Secure better provision for safeguarding public health, especially of children and securing better medical and hospital facilities in the country.

The CWA if formed would operate from a country centre.  The National Council of Women could not do these things which were not meant for the city and it had too many other issues to pursue.

The CWA motto is Loyalty to the throne, through service to our country by country women to country women.

Mrs Bowman said she would like to see the central movement of the Association start in Burra and would like to see the northern towns form an Association.
