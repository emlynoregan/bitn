A Bolt.  T.P. Halls and two friends were thrown from a sulky at Mitchell Flat on Sunday.  When a reluctant horse was given ‘a moderate supply of long oats’ it leaped forth snapping the traces and dashed off, pulling Halls over the rein guard and shooting his companions from the vehicle.  Fortunately a shaking was the only consequence.  The horse got to Baldina Creek before being recaptured.
