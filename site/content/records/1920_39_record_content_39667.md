Kooringa Methodist Church held its anniversary on 18 & 19 October.  A former pastor Rev. Edmund Smith now of Mile End conducted the services.  A good congregation attended.  Rev. Smith said his family’s connection to Burra started in 1847 when his grandparents and their family lived in a dugout on the tributary to the Burra Creek in the vicinity of Dead Man’s Bridge.
