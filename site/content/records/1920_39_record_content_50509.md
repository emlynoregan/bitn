J.H. Pearse & Sons Write complaining that travellers have again been leaving gates open on the Burra-Morgan road through their property.  This recently allowed recently shorn sheep out of the home paddock and required a re-muster aggregating at least 30 miles with horses already weary from constant riding.  The offer Â£5 for information leading to a conviction.  The writer admits that some of the cattle ramps are a bit rough and that perhaps people are using gates rather than negotiate the ramps and then leaving them open in protest, but such people are drones in the community.
