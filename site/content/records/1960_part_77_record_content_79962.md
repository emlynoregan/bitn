Notice.  The National Bank of Australasia gives notice that the weekly agency conducted at Hallett since 1909 will close on 29 September 1976.  This change has been brought about by declining use of the service as many clients now prefer to travel to Burra once or twice a week to shop and attend to banking business.

G.R. Spafford

Branch Manager, Burra.
