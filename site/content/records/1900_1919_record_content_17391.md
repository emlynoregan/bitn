Court.

Much of the page is devoted to reporting the case of Jack Gray who was accused of stealing a pair of boots.  The case is remarkable for the sloppy prosecution and the manner in which the bench appears to have accepted doubtful evidence.  Later evidence suggests the charge was utterly wrong and that even if Gray was guilty of something it wasn’t what he was charged with.  It all reads like a botched job, but in any event he got two months.  He was charged with stealing a pair of boots from M. Pederson, but it became clear that they had actually been taken from Kelly’s trap in Aberdeen.  He should have been charged with being in possession of items reasonably believed to have been stolen.  The report of the court hearing extends for 2⅓ columns and there is a further ½ column of editorial comment reflecting on the inept way the case was handled by the policeman, M-C Clarke.  The writer concludes that the bench would have been quite correct to have dismissed the case.
