Jo Gebhardt writes defending the culling of pepper trees and explaining why it should be done:

They have become a weed in many areas and are particularly damaging on the floodplains of the Burra Creek.  They are a significant threat to native vegetation and some landowners are spending significant money to control them.  Although it may be wonderful to contemplate that Chilean muleteers may have introduced them, we would have been better off if they had not, just as we do not now celebrate the introduction of species like Horehound, no matter how historic it may have been.
