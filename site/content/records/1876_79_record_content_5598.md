Deputation to Govt. Kingston Street Bridge. There was a deputation to the Hon. T. Playford, Commissioner of Crown Lands, on 27 Dec., comprising Dr Nesbitt (Mayor), Cr Batchelor & F.W. Holder. They sought a Govt. subsidy for expenditure on the Kingston St Bridge approaches. The line of road in question was formerly [though the paper says formally] on the schedule of main roads, but was taken off.  The approach would cost £450. Purchase of land	£175

Transfer of Title	£25

Filling etc.	£250

If there is no subsidy then a special grant is sought, as such a sum out of a year's rates of only £600 was unreasonable.
