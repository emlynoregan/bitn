Burra Town Council, 3 August

The Kooringa-Aberdeen Road only now needs rolling for repairs to be completed.

The question of the SAFU corner was raised and it will be inspected.

Cr Riggs moved that Sara & Co. be asked to sell the rectangular piece of land on their corner.  If Council cleared away the old building on it a good view of the road could be obtained.
