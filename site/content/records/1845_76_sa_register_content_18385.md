AS Mining Association [Editorial]

The 20th Annual Report of the SA Mining Association.

The Directors began with a complaint about the state of the copper market.  (The February news from England shows the price continuing to decline.)

From their last report the Directors note a further depression of the copper price by £6 to £9 per ton.  The latest price at the time of writing the report was £96 per ton.  This seriously affects the profitability of working the Mine.

No dividend is declared in the present report, though there is the prospect of one when the copper and ore on hand are disposed of, as the sale of these at current prices will swell the profit account to £12,695, which would pay the usual dividend and leave a small balance in hand.  At present the amount of undivided profit is £8,755.

For the six months to 30 September 1864, 3,773 tons of ore were raised at an outlay of £34,631-12-11 or £9-3-7 per ton.  This realised £47,409-13-6 or £12-11-4 per ton, leaving a profit of £12,778-0-7 or £3-7-9 per ton.  This profit has been increased by £800 from rents and £5-17-6 from fees, to a total from all sources of £13,583-18-1.  Out of this the 55th dividend amounting to £12,320 was paid on 3 December.

The Captain’s report is favourable.  There are a great number ‘of unworked pitches on hand which would be worthy of miners’ attention if they were to call that way.’

Ore is still being raised at Karkulto, but none has been sampled in the last 9 weeks.
