Takati Mine.  Connection has been made to lower workings by an inclined winze.  This gives access to all the mine without using the main shaft.  The richest portions of the lode formation are being followed underground at various depths and from a recent crushing of c. 50 tons about 2 oz per ton were obtained.  Prior to this crushing 311¾ tons had returned 846 oz 15 dwt 8 gr.  The shaft put down on this property by the Baldina Company to try to locate Pexton’s Lode is 50 ft deep.  A recent crosscut west picked up the lode and 99 ft was driven on it northwards.  The lode did not, however, disclose payable ore.  The crosscut was then put out an additional 33 ft west.
