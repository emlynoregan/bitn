Mongolata Gold has moved into new premises at 1 Commercial Street.  It has a bigger space to display its range of malachite, crystals and minerals, as well as gemstone jewellery.  It has added solid pine furniture and other items, including doors painted by artist Jim Dunstan [photo] and pottery by Ronda [sic?] Dunstan.  Kevin and Barb are also continuing to offer mine tours and cemetery walks.
