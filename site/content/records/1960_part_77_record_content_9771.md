Obituary.  Richard (Dick) Crang died in an Adelaide Hospital 24 January.  He spent five years in Burra at Elder, Smith & Co.  He joined Elders in 1932 at Wentworth NSW where he was born 49 years ago.  He came to Burra in 1935 and enlisted from here in June 1940 in the 2/7 Field Regiment AIF.  After the war he opened Elder’s Kingscote Branch and from 1947 to 1951 was manager at Pt Augusta.  He then spent five years as a Branch Inspector before opening Elder’s Alice Springs Branch in 1956.  Ill health forced a transfer to Adelaide twelve months ago.  He is survived by a widow and two sons, Bill and Richard.

[Born 24 June 1912 Wentworth NSW.]
