BCS held a Sheep Management& Innovation Field Day at the schoolâ€™s Brewery Hill on 9 October.

Guest presenters, students and interested producers attended.  Ian McFarlane of SheepCorrect SA organised the event.

Justin Lines of Mt Bryan described how rotational grazing on improved pastures allowed increased flock size and had other benefits.

Jodie Reseigh led a walk looking for native pasture species and participants were surprised to identify at least 16.

She described the benefit of having native pasture species.

Daniel Schuppan spoke on matching nutritional needs and pasture quality and supplementary feeding.

Michelle Cousins went through the benefits of electronic identification and drafting.

Darren McEvoy of Heiniger BioClip demonstrated the BioClip wool harvesting system.  Lambs were injected with a protein which causes a break in the wool.  A net is placed over the animal and four weeks later the net is removed and the wool is harvested.
