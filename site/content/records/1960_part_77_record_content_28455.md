Willalo Methodist Church will honour district pioneers at a service on 20 March.  Newly installed lighting will also be dedicated in their memory by Rev. David Pill.  The early lamps have been retained, but converted to electricity.  The occasion is also the 38th anniversary of the church, the foundation stone of which was laid by Mrs Hanlin in 1927.
