The four new cottages will be opened next Sunday by Mr Ron Pearse, the Board’s first Chairman and will be named after the Board’s current and second Chairman, Mr Ray Jennison.  The ceremony will be at the cottages in John Barker Street, just behind the first row, which were built in 1973.  They were designed by the Brown falconer Group with Andrew Davies in charge of the project.  The local firm of D.T. Jacka & Co. were the builders.  This will bring the Barkers of Baldina Cottage Homes to eighteen.  Nine in the first group and five in Chapel Street.  The former will be known as the Ronal K. Pearse Cottage Row.  The Board is a non profit making organisation and is now incorporated under the Retirement Village Act.  To date three of the cottages have been leased.  Each unit has a bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, dining/sitting room, front and back verandahs, carport and private garden.
