Burra Silos

The new wheat silo at Burra Railway Station took its first grain on 9 December 1963 and filled within seven days.  Heavy intakes began on 13 December and by the 20th the capacity of 100,000 bushels had been reached.  [Daily intake figures are printed.]  Since then there has been direct loading via the conveyor to the rail trucks, which elevates the grain at 70 tons per hour.  Trucks carrying 40 tons can be loaded in 15 minutes.  [This doesnâ€™t seem to conform to the rate cited.]  Inferior wheat still has to be bagged and stacked.  With silos filled throughout the country there is not the storage space to separate hard and FAQ wheat and this will cost growers 3d to 4d per bushel on their hard wheat.  At Burra only 12,000 bushels have been able to be taken and trucked directly as hard wheat, with the rest taken as FAQ.  Wheat came first from the early harvest areas of Peterborough, Yarcowie and beyond Spalding and this meant that some Burra District wheat had to go to silos at Farrell Flat, Saddleworth, or even Wallaroo and Adelaide.  The Burra silo has taken 200,000 bushels so far this season, with some 20,000 still to come.  Photo of loading wheat into a railway truck.
