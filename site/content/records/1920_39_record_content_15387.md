Four sailors arrived in town two weeks ago from Pt Pirie and camped near the railway station.  They obtained employment at the Aberdeen Reservoir except for one who was ill and went to hospital.  On Saturday, while drunk, two were stripped to the waist fighting while the one who had been ill fed their campfire with their shirts.  The language was particularly indecent.  Fines of 5/- + 10/- costs were imposed on each of James Rogers, Alfred Susans, Lewis Hastings and George Dollimore.  An old man, Martin Christenson, was charged with being drunk, but failed to appear and it was learned he was in hospital.  He was convicted without penalty.
