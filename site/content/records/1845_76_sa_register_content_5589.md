26 December 1850.  Left Port Wakefield on the mail cart at 5 a.m. and breakfasted at Dunn’s – within a short distance of where the remains of the wife of the maniac Fry were discovered.  More than 30 drays were camped there.  The water is almost black due to the lining of the well with green gum and the smell it fetid, but it is otherwise good.  Saw five or six eggs of the native pheasant – a bird slightly larger than a pigeon with an egg the size of a swan’s; fragile and pale pink, it is laid on the ground and hatches in the sun’s heat.  At 10 a.m. started again – twelve to fourteen miles through pine scrub with bush fires all round.  At last we reached Hoile’s Skillogalee Creek.  There we met, as usual, a drunken mob of bullock drivers, playing cards, drinking, swearing and fighting.  They are so little trusted that the landlord hold the nobler with one hand and takes the money with the other.  ‘They are the most debased set of animals in South Australia.’  The horses had strayed, delaying us for three hours.
