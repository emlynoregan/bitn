Burra Town Council, 7 April

A request was received from RSA to restore the guns to the memorial site in Market Square.

Cr Allen moved the request be not granted and Cr Pearce seconded.  He said no arguments were advanced other than that the RSA was not consulted.  The memorial was a beautiful tribute to the memory of our fallen soldiers.  The guns would be like erecting ‘a monument to the devilish ingenuity of mankind’.  He would be agreeable to going to the expense of mounting them where they were.

Cr Woollacott took exception to Miss Bubb’s letter in the paper.  He felt it was an insult.  He then proceeded to attack her personally for not volunteering for the front as a matron.

Cr Kellaway moved an amendment that they be put in the rotunda enclosure on suitable foundations.  Cr Morgan seconded this, but the Mayor ruled it out of order.  The motion was carried.

The Mayor and the RSA had sold buttons for the Tubercular Soldiers’ Aid Society on 21 March to the value of £19-1-6.

Various minor works were approved.
