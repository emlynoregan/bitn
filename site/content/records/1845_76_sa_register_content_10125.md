Gardens in Kooringa.  Some fine vegetables have been cut from Mr Varcoe’s garden, including some broccoli weighing from 10-12 lb.  On Saturday some fine cauliflowers were sent into the township from Captain Isaac Killicoat’s garden.  He has a garden of 13 acres at Abberton Park.  One of the cauliflowers weighed 42 lb and was 51 inches high with the diameter of the flower 13 inches.  The diameter of the top leaves was 40 inches and of the stalk 11 inches.  The survey for the railway from the Burra to the Murray runs through the garden.
