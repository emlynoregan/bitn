Farrell’s Flat School break-up of 19 December 1934 is reported.

Burra High School Annual Break-up Celebration of 19 December 1934 at the Burra Institute

Takings at the door amounted to just over £20.

The entertainment began promptly at 8 p.m. and after very creditable performances marred only by a lack of volume from some, the headmaster gave his report.

Mr Charlesworth said that with the introduction of fees it had been feared that enrolments would fall, but 51 students had enrolled in February.  He stressed that no fees were charged for pupils under 14 years of age, not if parents could not afford to pay them and when they were charge it was according to the ability of parents to pay.  Despite removals and illness during the year the average attendance was c. 44.  There had been several staff changes.  In February Miss Parry took the place of Miss Coghlan and Miss Waterhouse had taken Miss Dunstan’s place in Domestic Arts.  In the May vacation Mr Haese had been transferred to Peterborough after being here since 1926.  Mr Charlesworth was his replacement.

This year two students sat for the Leaving and 5 for the Intermediate Exams, but of course the results are not yet known.  The Minister of Education Hon. S.W. Jefferies visited in July and he was pleased with what he saw.  An Old Scholars Assoc. was formed and a number of pleasant and profitable re-union functions had been held.  Electric light has recently been installed through the efforts of the High School Council.  Average attendances had been: 1931, 52.8; 1932, 46.3; 1933, 43.7 & 1934, 44.

Dr Steele said a few words as President of the High School Council urging people to keep their students at school and of the necessity of this if the school was to continue.  He favoured raising the school leaving age to 16.  The Mayor Mr T.H. Woollacott was then called upon to make the presentations.

The second half of the concert program followed presentations.

The school banquet was held at the school on Thursday 20 December on which occasion the headmaster announced Miss O.C. Prior had been transferred to Adelaide High School and Mr Roy Jeffery had been appointed in her place.

Burra Primary School

Certificates were distributed on 20 December 1934

The headmaster Mr J. McConnon introduced the Chairman of the School Committee Mr A.B. Riggs and he thanked Mr Riggs and the committee for their assistance in getting electric light installed in a classroom, the off ice and the corridor [sic: it does say ‘a classroom’] and he thanked the Burra Electric Supply Co. for extending the main to the school without charge.  Mr Bednall was also thanked for his efforts in this matter and for presenting the school with a wireless set.

Qualifying Certificates were then presented to:

Geoffrey Rosman	Clare Penrose	Mary Jesser
