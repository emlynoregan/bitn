Burra Cycling & Athletic Club Boxing Day Sports at Victoria Park

There was an excellent program that was carried off without a hitch.  There was only one mishap that resulted in some painful gravel rash, but no serious injury.  The organisers were disappointed with the support shown by the town, nevertheless the attendance showed that interest in this kind of sport, so long dormant in Burra, had been awakened.  The Burra District Band played throughout the day.  In the evening a ball was held in the Oddfellows Lodge Hall, Aberdeen.  Results are printed.
