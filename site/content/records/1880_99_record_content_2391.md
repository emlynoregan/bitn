The Railway Openings.

The Port Pirie line has been the best paying in the colony and its extension was easily justified.  The Hallett-Terowie line is 20¼ miles long and runs nearly due north.  There is one intermediate station at Yarcowie, 14 miles from Hallett.  The steepest gradient is only 1:85 and that only for a short distance out of the Hallett station yard.  No cutting or embankment is more than 8-9’ and bridges are small, though there are numerous small culverts.  Rails are 50 lb per yd while on the narrow gauge Jamestown to Yongala line they are 41 lb per yd.  The expenditure on the Hallett-Terowie extension was £124,711. (£132,000 was budgeted for.)

Jamestown-Yongala Junction (Petersburg) is 21½ miles.  Terowie to Quorn will be 94 miles.  There is no precise cost for the Jamestown-Yongala Junction section, though the engineer’s estimate is £141,079, but the real cost should be somewhat less.  Yongala is the intermediate station 15 miles from Jamestown.  The new town in section 26 at the terminus is Petersburg, 73½ miles from Port Pirie and 154 miles from Adelaide.  Earthworks here are slightly heavier, but not much and there are only a couple of small bridges.  The ruling gradient is steeper at 1:40 just outside Jamestown Station and the next worst is 1:67 and a 1:72, but not for far.

On 14 December a special train left Adelaide early with the Governor and the official party.  [They are listed.]  The Governor was greeted at Burra by the Mayor, while the trail was fuelled.  A large crowd waited for the train at Hallett where the Chairman of the Hallett DC greeted the Governor.  The Governor, Sir William Francis Drummond Jervois, responded.  There was a pause at Ulooloo platform when it was found that the platform encroached on the carriage steps.  There was a further stop for speeches at Yarcowie, where Robert J. Fisher JP obliged and the Governor replied.
