J. Harry’s birthday.  (Reprinted from the Bendigo Advertiser.)

Joseph Harry of American Gully was 83 recently and he and Mrs Harry will celebrate their diamond wedding on 23 May 1934.  He was born in Burra SA and arrived in Bendigo aged 2.  His father, attracted by gold came by boat to Melbourne and made his way to Bendigo in 1851 and was among the earliest there.  In 1852 he went back to his family in Adelaide with seven or eight companions, with accounts of the wealth to be won.  This was the first overland trip from Bendigo to Adelaide.  On reaching Adelaide Mr Harry lost no time in taking his family to Bendigo and they went to live in a hut near where the Princess Theatre now stands in View Street.

[A story of an attempted robbery of gold from Mr Harry Sen. is recounted.]
