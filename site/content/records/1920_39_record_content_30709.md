A Political Meeting at Point Pass is reported at length.

Speakers were A.G. Cameron MP & M. Collins MHR.

Mr Collins when he spoke expressed his disenchantment with Canberra and the Government.  He was against the expenditure taking place on Canberra – he would have scrapped the whole city.  Now £250,000 was to be spent on the War Memorial.  He also spoke against the poor attendance of members at sittings.  He said it was a pity to see good legislation turned down because it was put up by the Labor Party – though they would do the same thing if they were in power.  He wanted to see the abolition of State Parliaments and have the states run by a commission of half a dozen clever businessmen.  Neither Liberal not Labor will do anything for the producers.  A Country Party is essential.
