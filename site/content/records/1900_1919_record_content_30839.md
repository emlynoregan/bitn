Burra Town Council, last week.

Postal authorities in Melbourne have referred the request for a lamp to the Adelaide authorities.

The Local Board of Health reports the incidence of infectious diseases for the year:

Erysipelas	3

Enteric fever	3

Pulmonary TB	3

Whooping cough	4

Measles	26

Diphtheria	34

These last two were not local outbreaks and the epidemic in both was widespread in Adelaide and other country areas.

The report favoured the introduction of the pan system instead of cesspits.

The new council met on 4 December.

Mayor’s allowance was set at £15.

The Salvation Army is to be given a final notice to meet near the rotunda.
