Hallett Railway Station has been renovated to improve accommodation for walkers on the Heysen Trail.  It was originally converted in 1992 when bunks, a pot-belly stove, sink and toilet were installed.  Now a rainwater tank has been installed, an interior wall knocked down, changes made to the plumbing and a coat of paint applied.

Other sites in the area are also getting some attention.  Mt Bryan East School will be inspected and shelters along the White Hill Road and Caroona Creek will be improved.  The trail comes from Willalo through Hallett to the summit of Mt Bryan and then to the Mt Bryan East School to Tooralie Gorge and south to Caroona  Creek before turning back through the hills along White Hill Road.
