Phil Rule of Hamilton Place, Adelaide, writes wondering if sports at Burra could be given a boost by making the racecourse property into a Community Sports Arena.  He suggests that if it is done it be called the James Gallagher Memorial Sports Ground, in tribute to the man sho did much work and dug deep into his own pocket to support sports in Burra and was the first Chairman of the Syndicate which started the idea of the grounds many years ago.  The avenue of pines could be named Birdseye Avenue in honour of the late Alf Birdseye, who planted and tended the trees in their early stages.
