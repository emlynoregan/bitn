Capt. McNamara VC made a somewhat botched visit to the town.  He flew in to publicise the Peace Loan, but having induced businesses to close for a couple of hours to maximise his impact, the Captain failed to appear until 5.45 p.m., by which time only the Mayor and three or four others were there to see him.
