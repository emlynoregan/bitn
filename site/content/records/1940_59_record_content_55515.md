Burra Pre-School Kindergarten.  A special general meeting was held on Friday 4 July and it was decided there was no option but to close.  After paying all debts, there will be about Â£8 cash, which will go to the Burra Hospital for the use of children patients.  Donated equipment can be reclaimed or after 26 July will be sold or given to the Burra Hospital if suitable.  Barbara Mellor, Hon. Secretary.
