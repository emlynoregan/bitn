Obituary.  A memorial service was held in the Kooringa Methodist Church last Sunday for E.T. Prior & Mrs W. Geake.  [The only male Prior to be registered as dying in SA in 1936 was Elijah Thomas Prior on 13 August at Kooringa aged 75 who was born at Nelson (Burra) 4 April 1861.  This seems to be a somewhat belated memorial service.  His death is only referred to as being ‘recent’.]
