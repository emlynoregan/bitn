Today there was excitement at the arrival of several specimens from the section recently leased by Messrs Bath and Bosance.  They are splendid examples of copper ore.  A stone seven feet from the surface was broken by Captain Killicoat and assayed by Mr A. Thomas of Kooringa.  It gave a produce of 55%.
