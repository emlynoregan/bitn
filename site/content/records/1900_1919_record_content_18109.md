The Burra Show was a great success at Victoria Park on Wednesday with c. £70 taken at the gates.

The weather was threatening with wind and dust until 9 a.m., but then a change brought good conditions.

Agricultural products could have been much better represented, but those on show were of the first quality.

G. Bailey scored the prize for wheat and Thomas Reynolds of Booborowie that for chaffed hay.

In Dairy produce the best collection and display was by E.N. Finch.

Draught stock was only a small section, but the quality was very good and much the same applied to blood stock.  Roadster stock was of good quality and a popular section.  Horses in action were as popular as ever.

Cattle numbers were up and better than formerly.

Dogs were good this year and though some years have seen more greyhounds there have not been better.

Pigs were not numerous and Hon. J.J. Duncan was the most successful exhibitor.

Agricultural implements could have been more numerous, as they attract great interest.

The exhibits of local coach-builder Mr S. Burns attracted interest: express buggy for C. Parks, masher cart for T. Pearse of ‘The Gums’, a hooded buckboard for J. Reed, a jump-seat sulky for Mr Neate and a masher cart for T. Turner.

The wood-chopping contest caused much excitement and the crowds left other attractions when it was announced.  Four contestants put in an appearance and the winner was E. Cahill from WA, ahead of local Sam Finch.

Sheep entries were better and larger than previously and additional pens had to be erected.  T. Sandland won Champion Merino Ram as well as Special.  He also won the pen of 5 rams.

Poultry entries were a record.  Messrs Flamank & Dennison were the most successful, having sent along between 60 & 70 entries.

Flowers were hardly up to earlier years’ standards and entries were well down.

Cookery entries were up.

The small display in the School Class section is disappointing and will have to be worked up.  Needlework was the one area of first-class work.

In fruit and vegetables Ah Chin practically scooped the pool with exhibits far superior to any hitherto seen at a local show.  His collection was a credit to any gardener.

The Terowie Brass Band played throughout the day.

A committee of ladies ran the refreshment booth better than ever.

E.J. Harris displayed an impressive pyramid of dairy produce of a great variety of product and great quality.

F. Harris showed a fine collection of dried fruit from Renmark.

Miss McMinn’s & Mr W. Bentley’s pupils displayed some really creditable paintings.

The concert in the evening was a great success.

The list of prize winners is printed.
