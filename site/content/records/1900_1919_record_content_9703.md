Burra Waterworks.

A deputation from the Town Council waited on the Commissioner of Public Works.  Originally the works were estimated to cost £3,600, but this crept up to £8,000 before they were completed.  The Corporation has leased the works for upwards of 15 years and water consumers here have had to pay nearly twice the amount of the general rate for the whole town and yet the cost of repairs means that even now the half –year’s rent cannot be met.  The deputation seeks the writing down of the capital account from £8,000 to £4,000 and the replacement of the present engine and pumps with modern equipment and that a new and larger reservoir be constructed with an additional main from the pumping station without increasing the capital account.  If neither of these is done the Corporation seeks to buy the system at valuation.  Mr Foster, the Commissioner, said that Burra was a town and not a country water district and towns in districts similar to Burra paid nearer to 10% than 2% which was about twice what Burra paid.  The Commissioner was willing to send the revenue accountant up to have the matter investigated, but he knew what the result would be – the Corporation would want to continue it themselves.  He would not sell at valuation.
