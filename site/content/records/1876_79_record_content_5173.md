Letters to the Editor. 
Thomas D. Jackson writes from Waukaringa announcing the sudden death of Henry Slate on the 27th Oct., leaving a wife and 9 or 10 children in Kooringa. Waukaringa inhabitants subscribed about £25-10-0 for the family and call on the paper to open an account to accept further donations.  [Henry Slate (age not given) married Eliza Edwards at St Mary’s Kooringa 19 September 1865. They had 7 girls and 3 boys: the first born 9 October 1866 and the last 24 October 1878.]
