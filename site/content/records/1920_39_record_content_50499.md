‘Try Again’ writes about the road between Dr Steven’s and L. Gordon’s homes, which is said to be an eyesore.  Some two years ago this road was cleared and a side path was gravelled.  Now apparently some unknown people have again deposited rubbish there.  This is no reason to close and sell the road.
