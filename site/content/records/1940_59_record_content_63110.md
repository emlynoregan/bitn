Burra District Council is concerned that insufficient action has been taken to destroy rabbits as required and the pests are in great numbers in the Gum Creek area.

Burra Burra Show Inc. held a general meeting on 6 April at which Rex. C. Warnes was elected President.  A minute of appreciation was recorded for the work of the past president, W.H. Lloyd.  The Governor will be invited to open the next show on 9 October.

The Secretary, Mr H.L. Foote, tendered his resignation.

Mr R. Fuss offered to further improve the flower pavilion with tables down the centre, his labour charges to be donated to the society.

The Society is seeking a date for Sheep Dog Trials.

The number of sections in Horses in Action will be reduced to conform with other shows.

Burra Burra DC has a huge job in keeping about 800 miles of district roads in order and it will be made easier by the approval recently granted for the purchase of a very heavy grader.  A sum of £10,000 has been spent on district roads during the financial year.  Forty miles of road have been formed in the Booborowie area.  The Council has applied for a grant of £21,800 for 1954-55 to enable the upgrading of Main Road 45 between Burra and Black Springs, with second priority to the Lochiel-Burra Road and the main streets in Hanson & Farrell Flat to be bituminised.  The cost of roads is very high.  Work to bituminise the Mt Bryan main street cost £3,000, of which £1,100 was for the bitumen alone.  The DC will sell some town allotments on which rates have been unpaid since 1940.
