The King’s Birthday Honours List included an MBE for the Mayor, T.H. Woollacott Esq.  This is the first time a Burra Mayor has been honoured while in office.  A former Mayor, Sir Frederick Holder was knighted [later in life].  Thomas Henry Woollacott was born in Burra in 1882 and entered the public life of the town in 1922 when he was elected to the Town Council as a representative for North Ward.  He held that position for eight years before being elected Mayor in 1930, a position he held until 1937.  This was a difficult period for the town, due to the depression and Mr Woollacott worked very hard to alleviate distress among the townspeople.  In 1936 the state’s centenary celebrations coincided with the Diamond Jubilee of the Burra Corporation and His Worship organised a drive to have the Council Chamber furnished in an appropriate manner with the handsome furniture it now contains.  In 1937 Mr Woollacott retired as Mayor, but again sought election in 1939.  Again he was in office during a difficult period, as war broke out.  Since then he has carried out his pledge of loyalty to King and Country and has steered the town through those difficult years.  He and the Lady Mayoress have sent three sons and one daughter to the fighting front and two of those sons have paid the supreme sacrifice.  In 1940 His Worship was inspired with the idea of getting non-working city dwellers to come to the country to live, thus providing housing accommodation for munition workers in the city.  He handed this idea to the Chief Secretary, who saw the opportunity offered and put the plan into operation.  As a result there was an influx of soldiers’ wives and others to Burra, where Mr Woollacott was kept busy finding accommodation for them, meeting them at the station, and helping to get their furniture into their new homes, and generally seeing them settled in.  The idea has spread to other country towns.  In 1944 he asked the Hon. Norman Makin & Mr A.E. Smith MHO to arrange for a clothing factory to be established in Burra.  Since the outbreak of war he has been the chairman of all recruiting committees and War Loan committees connected with Burra and is also chairman of the Burra and District Soldiers’ Welfare Committee and the Burra centenary Celebrations Committee.  It is only fitting that he should be Mayor during this important year and we congratulate him on the honour conferred upon him.
