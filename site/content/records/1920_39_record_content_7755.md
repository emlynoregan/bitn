Burra Town Council, Monday.

The Immigration Dept. desired the Council to institute a welcome committee for the British lads coming to Australia for rural work and to report from time to time on their progress.  The committee is to include a minister from each denomination.  The Mayor thought it was more of a matter for District Councils and perhaps a meeting could be scheduled for a Friday when pastoralists and farmers would be in town.  The Mayor was for action.  Cr Collins was for letting the matter lie on the table.  Cr Kellaway saw it as a political ploy for lowering wages.  Cr Collinsâ€™ motion to let the matter lie on the table was carried.
