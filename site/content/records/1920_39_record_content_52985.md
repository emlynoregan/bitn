Mongolata Goldfield

Baldina Mongolata GM Syndicate.  The battery has crushed 4½ tons of ore for 1oz 15dwt per ton without tailings.

Continued sinking the shaft to 20ft with values c. 2½oz per ton.  The seam continues the same width and is still going down on the under lay at about 1ft per 4ft.

Byles’ Mongolata GM Co. 21 September

200ft level.  No 1 winze advanced to 220ft.  Water inflow is too strong to continue.  Crosscut 10ft above water level extended to 32ft in lode, but in the last 5ft there were only traces of gold, though earlier up to 10dwt per ton.  Work will cease in the crosscut for now.

92ft level.  Crosscut to connect with main tunnel behind the shaft on the west side advanced to 13½ft.

52ft level.  Southwest crosscut advanced to 38ft on 4ft-wide lode showing 3-5dwt by pan test.

A new shaft has been started farther west.

Baldina Mongolata GM Co. has 4 parties of tributers working at present.

Golden Harp.  No. 1 Shaft.  North drive advanced to 68ft on a 2ft-wide lode very broken yielding 5dwt per ton by pan test.

No. 2 Shaft.  North drive advanced to 17ft on 3ft-wide lode of low grade ore.

5tons of 1st grade ore and 15 tons of 2nd grade ore was taken from the winze at 400ft level for the fortnight.  25 tons of 2nd grade ore was taken from the 52ft level.

Curlew.  14½ tons crushed for c. 51oz or c. 3½oz per ton without tailings.  This mine produces the best gold in the world, realising 6-7/- an ounce higher than any other gold sent to the Melbourne Mint.

Block 8 crushed 26 tons for 8½oz with cyanide still to come.

Fred Lewis’s Claim has now been successfully floated as the Mongolata South GM Syndicate.  It has a good lode showing and good prospects.

Jack Kellaway’s Claim has been floated as The Burra Mongolata GM Syndicate and should soon be on the map.

As previously reported new ground continues to be pegged and big results are anticipated for the field.
