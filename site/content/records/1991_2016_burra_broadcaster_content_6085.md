Burra Burra DC

Ursula Street lighting is being investigated â€“ in part to reduce the problem of urinating in that alley.

A piano will be relocated from the Town Hall to the Sports Complex.

Council decided a Dry Area adjacent to the Burra Creek picnic and barbecue area was not appropriate.

Council has been asked to investigate the future of the Burra Squash Courts.

A local resident has been given permission to use the unused concrete footbridge for testing his ideas for waterproof doors over the next three months.
