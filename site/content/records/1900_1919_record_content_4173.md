Obituary.  Former Bible Christian pioneer James Blachford, an old resident of the huts in the Burra Creek, has died and a memorial service was conducted by Rev. W.F. James at Redruth Methodist Church last Sunday.  [Registered as Blatchford]

James Blachford was born at Stoke Climsland, Cornwall 2 December 1808 and began work at the age of 7 for 18d a month.  His mother died when he was 13, leaving a brother aged 9 and a sister aged 11.  The father left the children to care for themselves.  James eventually went to live at a public house and dancing and wrestling were his favourite pastimes.  At 24 he married Eliza Skinner.  He never went to school, but learned to read and write.  At 26 he converted to the Bible Christian Church at Tinhay in Devon.  A few years later he was widowed with two small boys and subsequently married Charity Jury who survives him.  He began to preach and soon a chapel to seat 200 was built.  Early in 1847 he spoke to James Torr, an uncle of Dr Torr of Way College and they decided to go to SA which was much talked of in England on account of the Burra Mine.  Torr went first and Blachford followed in May 1847.  He preached on the ship with revivalist fervour.  The ship arrived in September 1847.  His family shared a building with the Torr family for three months before starting out for Burra in a bullock dray: a journey that took six days.  They lived in a large room at the mine shared by many families for many weeks before Blachford dug a hut in the bank on the north side of Welsh Creek near the Smelting Works.  There were then some 4,000 in Burra and two churches: a Wesleyan and an Anglican.  The Primitive Methodists held services, but lacked a parson and a church.  Blachford met John Stephens whom he had known in England and they decided to hold prayer meetings at Stephen’s home near Redruth where it seems there were then no services.  Before this could happen Thomas & John Pellew, John Halse, and many other Bible Christians arrived from England.  Thomas Pellew was appointed Class Leader and 15 persons attended the first Sunday morning.  James Blachford preached his first sermon in the open air about 52 years ago.  John Halse, John Pellew and Blachford preached in turn.  After vainly trying to get land at Redruth and Aberdeen, a site near the present Kingston St Bridge was obtained from the mine Directors at a peppercorn rent.  After difficulties a church to seat 200 was built.  Mrs Blachford sewed the calico ceiling.  All bills were paid as due.  A Sunday school was established and a choir formed.  There were many conversions and 47 members.  All this was accomplished before the first two Bible Christian ministers arrived in December 1850.  They found a large congregation, a church worth £400 with a debt of only £30 that did not bear interest.  Rev. James Row settled in Burra and succeeded well till the Victorian gold rush which took almost all the men to the diggings.  James Blachford went twice, where he did well briefly and preached too.  On returning to Burra he was a butcher near the Primitive Methodist Church in Kooringa before moving to Upper Wakefield.  Here he slowly built a congregation and a church was built and a Sunday school conducted by him for over ten years.  From Wakefield he moved to Watervale and kept a store where he gave good service to the church and contributions to the circuit rose from £20 to £80 p.a.  23 years ago he went to Adelaide and stayed there the rest of his life.  In his 86th year he would preach three times a Sunday, walking to his appointments.  He continued to attend Class Meetings in Gilbert St after his 92nd birthday.  His son Henry was his sole support and he died tragically in January.  James Blachford died on 10 September in his 93rd year.
