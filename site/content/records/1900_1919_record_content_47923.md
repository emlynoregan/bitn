‘Billy Shugg’ writes in Cornish dialect.  He wonders why the paper reported not a word of the ‘grett hindiggnation meating’.  [This appears to be the meeting referred to by ‘Jimmy’ where Mr Crewes berated non-volunteers and from comments it appears to have been on the subject of ‘Billy Ewes’ conscription referendum.  Jimmy’s reference suggests the meeting was held on Friday 1 September, but I can see neither any advertisement announcing such a meeting nor any report of it other than the references in this pair of dialect pieces.  Even ‘Billy Shugg’s’ complaint elicits no editorial explanation.]
