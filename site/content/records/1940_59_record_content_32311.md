Burra North Red Cross held its AGM 2 July in the Croquet Club Hall.  Elected:

President, Mrs H. Jennison; Vice-President, Miss M. Rogers, Secretary, Mrs M. Miels; Assistant Secretary, Miss M. Pearce and Treasurer, Mrs S. Scroop.

The secretary reported they has 102 members.  There had not been a great deal of fundraising this year.  They had donated £10 to the local Hospital, £5 to the Food for Britain Appeal and £5 to the TB Hostel Appeal.  During the year there had been several combined meetings with the Burra Branch in an effort to raise funds for local projects, but nothing had materialised.

Early in the year 27 certificates were awarded to members for faithful service during the 1939-45 war.
