Jim & Ronda Dunstan write expressing their agreement with the decision not to approve development of the Stony Gap wind farm and hoping that TRU energy will abide by this ruling.  As well as the potential health issues they believe the decision will aid in the preservation of remnant Peppermint Box Grassy Woodland and Iron Grass Temperate Grassland and the pygmy blue-tongue lizard.
