Five girls escaped from the Redruth Reformatory on the night of 14 September and have been recaptured.  Two were found by John Sandland at Norman Farm east of Burra.  Two turned up on The Gums Station on the Eastern Plains last Thursday in a starving condition and Mr Pearse kindly returned them in a buggy after feeding and nursing and a dayâ€™s rest.  On Monday the fifth was brought back by Mr Robert McBride who found her wandering on the travelling track in Baldina District.
