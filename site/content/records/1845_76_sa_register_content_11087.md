Burra Burra Benevolent Board

R.B. Robinson (Chairman), Rev. D.J.H. Ibbetson, Rev. J.G. Wright, Messrs Challoner, Watts, Hampton & Pascoe.

Relief was given to two destitute widows.  One was granted 10/- per week and the other was given £2 to proceed to Adelaide with her two small children, where further assistance might be given by the Destitute Board.

A poor woman who arrived a few days earlier from England, and who was confined in a hut in the creek without any means of support, was also given assistance.

Four poor men, who have been only a few days in the colony, and who are disabled by affliction, were considered destitute.  One, with a large family, was allowed 15/- per week and the other three 10/- per week each.

Total relief granted for the month was £14.
