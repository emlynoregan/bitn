Local Court, Kooringa, 26 August.

John S. Malling charged William Nicholson with unlawfully carrying away carpenter’s tools from his house while Malling was in Adelaide.  He had taken them to Penwortham and used them to work on Rev. Bagshaw’s house.

Nicholson said the complainant’s wife had given him the tools; which she denied.

Nicholson said Malling owed him more than £20 in wages and this complaint was taken out of spite.  He had brought the tools and was ready to return them.

His Worship considered the charge made out and in consideration of the return of the tools imposed a fine of 1/- with 28/- costs.

John P. Winchcombe charged David Ballard with assaulting him.  On 29 July the defendant came to Winchcombe at Apoinga with a whip in hand and asked him why he had stated untruths about him in the newspapers.  When Winchcombe refused to fight him, Ballard struck him two or three blows before someone intervened and took him away.

Ballard said he had been provoked by lies put into the paper by Winchcombe about him in connexion with a drunken woman who was in court in Kooringa a few days previously.

His Worship said that such might be pleaded in mitigation; it did not excuse the assault.  After reading the newspaper account His Worship said he could not see anything to provoke the assault.  He imposed a fine of 20/- plus 27/- costs.

John P. Winchcombe charged Joseph Jones with taking away a bridle.

The evidence reveals a rather trivial matter and Jones was fined 5/- with 27/- costs.
