Supreme Court of SA.

Addressing the Grand Jury with respect to the Gottlieb Keirnall case, His Honour said:

‘Presuming they (the Grand Jury) were satisfied of the manner by which the deceased came to his death, and on that point the evidence appeared conclusive, they would have to consider what motive the prisoner had for killing him.  It would appear the deceased gave very great provocation.  He threw stones and threatened or attempted to set fire to the prisoner’s house.  It was for them (the Grand Jury) to consider how far the prisoner’s provocation would reduce the prisoner’s offence to manslaughter.  To constitute the crime of murder malice aforethought was a necessary ingredient.  At the same time, it was not a slight provocation that would so far justify the slaying of another as to reduce the crime to that of manslaughter.  His Honour concluded his remarks, with reference to this case, by reminding the Grand Jury that he would have to address another jury more fully on the subject afterwards.
