Letter.  A.A. Davey writes re the apathy shown regarding the Burra Institute.  He cannot believe that after all these years of existence, there can be no committee of management.  He had seen the Institute survive the Boer War and the Great War and now appeal for subscribers to rally around and help to tide the Institute over the strenuous time they were all going through.
