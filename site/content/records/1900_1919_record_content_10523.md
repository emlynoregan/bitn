Thomas H. Broad is 78 and is holidaying with his daughter Mrs Bell of Mt Bryan.  He came to Burra in the early days as a wheelwright, being paid Â£1 a week.  He was successful for a while at the Victorian goldfields and on returning became a successful sheep farmer at Sod Hut for 25 years.  He then sought better land in the Hundred of Bright which proved to be disastrous.  He has three sons and seven daughters: Mrs Nicholls (WA), Mrs Bell (Mt Bryan), Mrs Hopkins (WA), Mrs Burton (MT Bryan), Mrs Hare (Burra), Mrs Kutchenmeister [sic] (Burra), Mrs Bell (Kapunda), John (WA), Thomas (Burra) & Henry (Qld).  Mrs Broad at 74 is in good health and presently living with Mrs Hare (Kooringa).
