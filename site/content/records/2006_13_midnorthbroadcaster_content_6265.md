Burra Community Library celebrated its 30th birthday on 24 September with a gathering of about 30 people including the past Head Librarians.  Shirley Thamm was there after 21 years in the History Room helping enquirers.  Mary Woollacott, who has been there longer than most can remember, read a poem summing up the library and its changes over the past 30 years.  Colin Fidock, who was the first Head Librarian, attended with his wife, Dani.  [Photo of the four Head Librarians: Colin Fidock, Tess Hopkins, Beth Wiley and Bev. Low.]
