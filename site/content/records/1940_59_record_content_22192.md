Burra & Hallett Branches of the Fathers’ Association met on Friday night at the Burra Town Hall.  President T.H. Woollacott read a remembrance ‘to the memory of our sons and daughters who have given their lives for their King, Country and Home’ and the audience responded ‘We Shall Not Forget’.  He said these sort of social occasions cemented a feeling for the common good of the members of the services and of the country.  The Fathers’ Association represented support given to thousands of service men and women throughout the Commonwealth and its membership was growing rapidly.  He was supported by Cr Kellaway, Mr G.H. Dollman, the President of the Hallett Branch, Mr Miller and Vice-President, Mr W. Phin.  [Speeches are reported.]

The Burra Branch had c. 28 members and much of its success was due to the enthusiasm of the Secretary, Mr W. Carpenter.  They expected soon to have a Women’s Branch.

The evening also had musical items.

Mr A.B. Riggs moved the vote of thanks and in doing so noted that the Burra Town Council had only taken over the hall on the previous Monday and this was the first function to be held in the [newly named] Burra Town Hall.  Mr Alf Walker seconded the motion and Mr Fitzgerald and W. Carpenter responded.  Mr H.J.B. Jennison spoke on behalf of the RSL.  Mr Fitzgerald said the boys never got a good spin after WWI and they were determined that after the present war they would get a fair go.

Mr Jennison recounted his own experience after WWI.  He was just over 18 when he enlisted and 3¼ years in the army and was wounded twice.  After the war he wanted to take up a trade, but could not be apprenticed because he was over 21 years of age.  He took up wool classing under a vocational training scheme of the time and was paid 42 shillings a week while learning.  Having got his certificate he applied for a job, but the firms concerned went back on their promises to employ returned men and he spent three months at Mt Barker doing nothing.  One day he took a motorcycle trip to Burra and Mr George Thorpe of Eyles & Crowle [sic: for Eyes & Crowle] had given him a job as grease boy at the magnificent salary of 25 shillings a week – not much a reward from the people of the country for such long service in the army.  Such things would happen again if the RSL and the Fathers’ Association did not fight for better.  Supper followed.
