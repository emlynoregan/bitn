Miss Elsie Daenke, daughter of the shipping representative of Elder, Smith & Co., and a friend flew up to Burra from Adelaide on Sunday to go to church at Kooringa Methodist Church and returned after lunch with friends.  Elder, Smith & Co. have become the booking agents for Australian Aerial Services Ltd. and the trip was arranged by the Companyâ€™s agents in the Bell Bird, a DH 50 machine with a Siddeley-Puma 240 h.p. engine and accommodation for four.  They departed Albert Park at 8.55 a.m. and arrived in Burra at 10.10 a.m.  This was the first passenger aeroplane to arrive at Burra and at departure time 30-40 cars had arrived to see off the visitors in high wind with cold driving rain.  Barney Rogers assisted in getting the plane airborne at 3.10 p.m.  They arrived at Albert Park, 90 miles away, at 4.30 p.m.  Aeroplane taxi work has become popular interstate, but is in its infancy in SA.  Pastoralists are making greater use of such services daily.  The cost is 2/- per mile and the plane can carry four passengers.
