W.H. Challoner writes from Burra Burra Mines 5 June.

Today I examined the bones and agree with the very exact description given by Mr MacDermott.  My impression is that they are the remains of a gigantic member of the Phascolomy family.

(Editor: Mr Waterhouse, Curator of the Institute Museum is now at Kooringa to examine the bones.)
