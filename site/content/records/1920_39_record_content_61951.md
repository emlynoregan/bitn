John Jenkin was the first dayman at £2-2-0 a week.

First auditors were John Armstrong and George Woerner.

The first Councillors:

North Ward	G. Sara and A. Bartholomæus

Middle Ward	R. Sanders and E. Lipsett

South Ward	Joseph Roberts and John Snell

This year as a centenary effort the Government granted £110 for tree planting.  The Council has added £100 and citizens have contributed a total of £101.  Under this grant we are planting 650 trees in streets and reserves.

Council proposes a swimming pool for the town.  In my opinion this is absolutely necessary to keep out town up-to-date and I am asking for all assistance citizens can give.  Many towns smaller than Burra have pools.  We have a first class site, plenty of building materials and water.  The Council is very enthusiastic over this scheme.

Relief work this year has enabled the employment of most men for short periods at full wages and there was a special grant at Christmas time to help the unemployed get a little enjoyment at that time.

The cemetery occupies something over 7 acres and has over 4,000 graves.  The Council does its best once a year at least to clear all undesirable growth and generally keep it tidy.

The Park Lands are being cared for and when the present tree planting is completed the Burra Creek alone will be one of the prettiest parks in the country.

Street lighting is being adequately supplied by the Burra Electric Supply Co.  The incoming Council will consider a proposal to floodlight the Fallen Soldiers Memorial.

During the year we received visits from Sir George Ritchie (Chairman) and Mr V.C. Ryan (Organiser) of the [committee for the] Centenary of the State.

This year is also the Diamond Jubilee of the Town Council and I thank the leading townsmen for their aid in refurnishing the Council Chamber.

On behalf of the Committee, I call on everyone to do his or her share in the Back-to –Burra Centenary Celebration from 2-8 October.

[The Town Clerk, Mr E.J. Davey then read the proclamation of Sir Anthony Musgrave, Governor of SA, when he proclaimed Burra a Municipality.

The Mayor then said he would like to mention several things the Council planned to do in the coming year.  Actually he began with a discussion of the refurnishing of the Council Chamber, in which inadequate old cedar chairs, not fit for the use of visiting dignitaries, had been replaced by chairs donated by various men of the town.

He then went on to further detail about the tree planting scheme and the proposal to better light Market Square and place floodlights at the foot of the Fallen Soldiers Memorial.  He said they would also have to consider the widening of the Mine Bridge.  Its narrowness made it dangerous and in the process the footbridge would have to be done away with or improved.  It was not a very respectable looking thing anyway.]
