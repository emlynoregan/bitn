Column by ‘Fossicker’

There is a suggestion that legislation might be brought to bear on owners of inoperative mines.

‘Fossicker’ is clearly against the Boer War:

‘But what’s the fight all about, anyway; is it worth the candle?’

He quotes a Sydney Journal re J.D. Cave: ‘the best known and physically, perhaps, the biggest figure in SA municipal politics outside the city. For thirty years he was at the Burra, for some time as the colleague of Treasurer Holder, who got all his financial experience as the local town clerk.  Also as expert flower raiser – a chrysanthemum and some other things are named for J.D. Cave.’

Why is there yet no stir about municipal elections?

‘Fossicker’ adds his support to Forder’s well-wishers.
