Resident Magistrate’s Court, Kooringa, 9 December.

Alexander Middleton was charged by John Solomon Barnett with having, while in the complainant’s employ, sold a piece of brown holland, value 7/-, and not accounted for the money.  (Adjourned from 29 November.)

After Middleton had been discharged in September or October Barnett’s brother had told him that Middleton had sold some brown holland to Mrs O’Leary, which he had not accounted for and which he denied selling.

Lewis Barnett said that the defendant and another employee named Gregory had gone out in a cart hawking goods.  When they returned the piece of holland was missing.  Middleton said he must either have left it at Mrs O’Leary’s or lost it.  All other goods were accounted for.

Mr Fitzgerald, acting for Middleton, asked if witness had ever written to his brother suggesting that this mistake on Middleton’s part provided a good reason for breaking the six month contract between them.  Witness said he could not remember.

Mary O’Leary said her husband kept the Sod Hut public-house.  She said the defendant and Gregory had visited her and she had bought several articles including a piece of brown holland.  The yard measure was left behind at her house.

Other evidence was given, but His Worship said the error charged in this case might be accidental and he could not see it in any other light.  It was proved that the holland was sold to Mrs O’Leary and the defendant would have to pay for it and the costs of the proceedings.
