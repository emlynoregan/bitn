Burra High School Speech Night & Prize Giving

The entertainment portion was a great success.

Headmaster’s report by Mr L.N. Easson.

The school opened 30 years ago.  This year the library had been renovated.  28 new students enrolled at the start of the year to bring the enrolment to 62.  The highest enrolment during the year was 66, one more than the previous year.  By exam time it was 59, an improvement on 1942, as was the average attendance of 57.  The school was thankful to the Town Council for the use of Victoria Park for sport.  For Patriotic Purposes the school raised £83 in cash, £24 in waste products, £23 in toys and £220 was invested in War Savings.

Two old scholars, Lt L. Thomas & PO Brian Riggs had particularly distinguished themselves in the war effort and unfortunately four had died on active service: Clyde Sellars, Noel & Roy Woollacott and Robert Walker, while Ken Fuller was reported missing.

Eight students passed the Intermediate and others had gained subjects in that and in the Leaving and Leaving Honours Examinations.  He gave recognition to the work of the staff.  Miss Brooks would not return in 1944.  Mr Goldsworthy would attend Teachers’ College.  Dr Steele presented the prizes.

R. Aughey	Maisie Pearce	Eileen Hogan

Doug. Satchell	June Bourman	Keith Bailey
