The Gulf Road Re-enactment will begin in Burra on 13 October.  Bullocky, Mr Jim Kelly and his team will cart copper ore from Burra to Pt Wakefield over the historic 96 km route.  The teams will leave Burra at 10 a.m. after a Bullockies Breakfast on the banks of the creek.  They will be seen off by Mr Kym Bonython the Chairman of the Jubilee 150 Committee.  The plan is to travel about 5 km a day and to pass through Hanson, Farrell Flat, Mintaro, Leasingham, Auburn, Hoyleton, Halbury, Balaklava and Pt Wakefield.  The route was pioneered between 1849 and 1857 as an attempt to reduce the cost of transporting ore by bullock the 160 km to Pt Adelaide, where it was shipped as ballast on wool ships sailing to Wales.
