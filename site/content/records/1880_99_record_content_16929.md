Travelling Stock Routes.

The Mayor took the chair at a meeting at the Institute on Wednesday to discuss the Government’s proposal to cut up and lease travelling stock reserves.

J. Lewis moved that the meeting condemn the proposal.  If some people abused them or used them illegally that could be remedied.  If income is needed a small tax could be charged on stock not going to or from market.  The Government perhaps wanted to force the use of railways, but from Burra it would cost 1/- a head and a loss of condition, compared with 2d a head and good condition on the stock route.

Stock could not travel on a chain road and even a three chain one would not allow flocks to pass.

T. Fairchild 2nd and said abuses could be curbed and should be because while they were largely used by adjacent landowners and others sponging off the feed they might as well be cut up.

Cr Coglin said he knew of several flocks regularly kept on the routes.  Motion carried.

J.B. Davidson moved that the properties of adjacent landowners would decrease in value as a result of cutting up the routes- rather remedy the misuse he said.  J.F. Duff 2nd.  Carried.

Cr Coglin moved they be maintained for bona fide travel as originally intended.  Carried.
