Burra Kindergarten AGM on Monday 1 March was poorly attended.  The Kindergarten Management Committee and the Parent Auxiliary were merged to reduce the number of meetings and officials to be elected, but it proved impossible to elect a President, which creates many problems in running the Kindergarten.  The AGM will reconvene on 15 March.
