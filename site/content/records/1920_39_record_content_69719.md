Perry Bros. Circus arrived on Thursday and it was very hot.  In late morning four elephants came to drink at the Market Square trough and kept their attendants busy for some time pumping water.  After drinking they filled their trunks with water and bathed themselves and each other thoroughly; the two larger ones paying particular attention to the younger pair.
