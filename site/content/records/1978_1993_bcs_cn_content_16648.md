Burra Yacht Club

The Bicentennial Regatta is being planned and the club has hopes for many entries in this year’s events.  At the Club’s AGM recently it was decided to donate $4,000 to the Burra Council towards the new toilet block on the creek and $100 to BCS and $100 to the National Trust for special projects.  The club also regretfully accepted the resignation of Chairman Glen Ward and member Pat Greet.  Office bearers this year: Chairman, Peter Reilly; Vice-Chairman, H. Bernhard; Secretary, D. Parnell and Treasurer, M. Reed.
