[The article is a review of a general report on 12 years of the Burra Mine’s operations.]

The aggregate value of the ore raised in that time is stated to be £1,712,370-11-11 and the cost of production is put at £1,017,757-4-3.  This means the nett profit has been £694,613-7-8 or 68¼%.  This is an almost unparalleled return for a mining operation and has earned the Burra Mine a world-wide reputation.  Of course all mines head either towards the exhaustion of the resource or at least to the point where the cost of production matches the value of the produce.  From September 1850 to September 1851 24,867 tons were raised, which realised £ 242,781-15-10 and which cost in production £127,528-8-0, leaving a nett profit of £115,253-7-10.  Against this in the last whole year available, March 1856 – March 1857 the ore produced was 10,961 tons, the price realised was £171,403 and the cost was £128,780, leaving a nett profit of £42, 622.  The average annual nett profit for the 12 years is £57,884.  The nett profit for the last whole year is thus £15,262 below that average and the last half year profit available, from March-September 1857, is £17,678, which if doubled for the year would give a nett annual profit of £35,356 or £22,528 below the 12 year average.  Profit has been falling over the last 18 months despite increased amount of ore being raised.  While some of this decrease is due to a fall in the price of copper, which in 1856 was £17-6-6 per ton and in the last period to £15-6-1.  But more significantly the cost of production has risen from £8-13-8 per ton to £12-4-4 per ton; an increase of £3-10-8.  The return shows that the nett profit over the last six months is lower than at any time in the past 12 years.

[The past 12 years’ results are then presented in a table.]

It is notable, however, that while the nett profit for the last 3½ years has not equalled that of the first five years, it has exceeded that of the intermediate 3½ years and it is possible that the results of the next 18 months, completing a five year period might keep up with the average.
