Burra Burra Hospital

In response to a community questionnaire the following recommendations have emerged as a Community Statement on Health Planning Issues.

Services which are vital to the district and must be based in Burra to maximise their effectiveness:

Acute Hospital services including general surgery, existing specialist surgery and obstetrics services.

A counselling person (s) for stress, drug, alcohol etc.

Accommodation for relatives of patients from outlying areas.

Increased aged accommodation and outreach services for the districtâ€™s frail aged.

2.	Services which would be additional to the above, but which are not considered to warrant implementation at the expense of any of the above.

Speech Therapist

Dietician

Physiotherapist
