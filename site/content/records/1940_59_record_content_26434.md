Diphtheria Immunization

The Local Board of Health for the District and Burra Town Councils will conduct a campaign to immunize children between 6 months and 12 years.  In the last 40 years diphtheria has killed more than 1,500 children in SA.  Parents are advised to obtain a Form of Consent from the Secretary of the Local Board of Health, (Mr A.J. Hill) or from the Head Teacher at the nearest school, complete it and return it before 31 May 1946.
