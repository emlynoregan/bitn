Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co.  When shares in this company were bought it was generally understood things might happen when the price of copper reached Â£70 per ton.  It has been that for several weeks.  Residents are wondering if the directors intend carrying out their promise.  The 25th Half-yearly Report is just to hand and profits from house rents, grazing rents, royalties and tributes plus interest, exceeds expenditure.  The directors are awaiting a further increase in the copper price before getting in outside capital.
