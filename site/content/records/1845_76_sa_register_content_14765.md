Kooringa Post & Telegraph

A ‘Kooringa Tradesman’ writes 24 July:

It seems that our Legislature has decided that the Post Office shall be moved to the Telegraph Station despite a memorial to the Postmaster-General and a petition to the House of Assembly.  Our objection was not so much against the amalgamation as against the position of the Telegraph Station as a Post-Office.  Had there been no Post-Office at Redruth it would have been near the truth to say that the Telegraph Station was in a central position, but there is one at Redruth and it is untrue to say that the Telegraph Station is central to Kooringa.  The nearest house is 150 yards away.  It has now been said by a competent engineer that it will cost £100 to make a safe road for the mail cart to go and return and the Government proposes to spend a further £200 to provide Post-Office accommodation at the Telegraph Station.  The interests of economy might be served by locating both departments in an office in a central part of Kooringa.  Let the Station-master keep his suburban residence and attend the office in office hours.  For every Redruth resident who would have to come a little further to send a telegram there would be 100 Kooringa residents or more who have to call at the Post-Office.
