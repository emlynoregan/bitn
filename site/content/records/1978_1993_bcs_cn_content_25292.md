Kathy Sleigh

Aged 22 and hold the position of itinerant teacher, which involves much outback travel to visit remote and isolated students.  Last year my position was based at Yunta.  I visit 23 families with a total of 36 students from pre-school to Year 11.  Visits to the host school are arranged for the students and there are plans to take some BCS students to visit some of the isolated students.  [Photo.]
