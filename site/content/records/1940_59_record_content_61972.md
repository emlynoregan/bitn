Burra Hospital Board

A list of required items will be circulated to ladies’ organisations.  Repairs to the tennis court have been deleted from the list for the time being.  Dean W. Berry notified the full contract price with alterations at £23,887.  This was passed for payment.  The fifth progress payment was made, bringing the total so far to £12,200.

Notification was received of conditional subsidy for 1953-54 of £3,520, an increase of c. £260.  Attracting trained staff remains a serious problem.  The overdraft stands at c. £5,000, but should ease by c. £400 by 31 December.  Mr Marston congratulated Mrs Tennant on the success of the Ladies’ Fete on 4 December, which raised about £667 for essential maintenance.
