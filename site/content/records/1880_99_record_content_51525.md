'The wife of Martin Pederson of Kooringa gave birth to triplets on Thursday night last.  The mother and trio are in excellent health while the father is proud of his little visitors.'

[Unfortunately this optimism was not justified:

The triplets were born 12 October

Elizabeth Pederson aged 33 died 4 November from pleurisy and pneumonia and the triplets followed from want of breast milk:

Alice died 1 November 1893

Lilian died 4 November 1893

Elizabeth died 20 March 1894]
