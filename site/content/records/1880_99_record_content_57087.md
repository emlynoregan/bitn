Council Tenders.

People are expressing dissatisfaction that Council departed from its specifications for the building of a dry stone wall to protect a footpath in East Ward and so expended money that could have been saved.  Had Mr Rogers known that tenders were required for a lime and sand wall he would have submitted one, but he was boycotted and the work let for £2-5-0 a chain that could have gone for £1-19-0 a chain.
