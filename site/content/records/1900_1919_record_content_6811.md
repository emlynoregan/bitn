Burra School held its visiting day on Monday and ‘the children were put through their facings’ [?] by the headmaster, Mr F. Fairweather, and acquitted themselves very well.  The modern system seems to induce the students to study their lessons with much interest.  Unfortunately the school is short staffed due to economic circumstances.  The school was addressed by Rev. T.B. Anguin and Dr Sangster, Chairman of the School Board of Advice, distributed certificates.
