Advt.  Queen of Wands Café opened in Burra on 1 July.  Jay Phypers says he has been kept busy.  Originally from Booborowie, Jay has moved back to the district after time as a bouncer in some of Adelaide’s top night spots.  He has also run a café in Adelaide.  Also running the café is Kellie Riekstins, who worked for five years in the kitchen of the Burra Motel.  The café caters for all budgets with everything on the menu below $10.
