The arc lamp.  The chain of the arc lamp broke one night last week as W. Geake was putting it up after the moonlight period.  He caught the lamp as it fell and only narrowly escaped being precipitated some 12ft to the ground.  On recent nights it has burnt fairly well and on Friday actually managed to keep alight till 10.30!
