The Advertiser Tour.  The Mt Barker-Burra stage finished in Burra on Saturday, but only a small group attended the finish, which had to compete with the football final.  Fifteen riders contested the finish, which was won by K. Stewart of Victoria.  Local people presented the stage winner with a 5 guinea trophy and £12 cash, with £13 going to other places.  The Mayor greeted the riders.  Many more people were on hand for the start of the fifth and final stage at 9 a.m. Sunday in Market Square.
