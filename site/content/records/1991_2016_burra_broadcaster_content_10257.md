Burraâ€™s Cultural Weekend brought the town alive.  A record crowd attended the 5th Antique & Decorating Fair.  Market Square was decorated with balloons.  The Gallery had a display of photographs by Dick Cleland, a barbershop quartet wandered the town centre and four poets provided poetry readings.  Martin Johnson conducted a poetry workshop.  On Saturday night the Dennis Sheridan Swingtet played for a dinner dance at the Burra Hotel.  Food outlets and antique shops did well over the weekend.
