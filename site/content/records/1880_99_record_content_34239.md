Burra Waterworks.

As wished for by ratepayers the Council resumed control of the Waterworks in March with a three-year lease.  Council has to pay interest at 5% amounting to £425-6-0 p.a.  Costs to the Corporation including sums owing to the Government in March being £663-7-10.  Rates to date are £521-6-8 with more to come and it is expected the year will conclude with a small credit balance after meeting the old debit of £69.  115 spare meters were returned to the Government and earned £324 credit.
