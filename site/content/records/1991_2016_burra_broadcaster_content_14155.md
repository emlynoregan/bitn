Mongolata Gold Mine has been the focus of interest by the mining exploration company Redfire Resources for a number of weeks.  They were investigating the feasibility of open cutting the hill currently being mined by Kevin Wallis and eventually they would focus on the possibility of mining underground in the sulphide zone below the water table.  In the 1930s the Mongolata Mine yielded about one ounce per ton with occasional richer pockets of gold.  An open cut would require the movement of some 45 million tons of rock to yield perhaps 4 grams per ton.

Kevin Wallis continues to make wages out of his gold mine using traditional mining techniques.  Byles Mine faces the east, with the main adit dug into the hill some 250 m and finishing c. 60 m below the surface.  A narrow set of rails runs along the mine adit, which is shored up with timber and which passes various side drives and dead ends before opening up at a main shaft to the surface.  Tunnelling proceeds beyond the end of the rails.  The adit slopes slightly upwards to facilitate the removal of ore in trucks holding almost a tonne.  The side drives indicate the amount of work done in the 1930s.  Around a bend is a second major shaft that plunges to the water table at the 420 ft level.  The water table is 100 ft lower than when the mine closed at the end of the 1930s.  Kevin has had a relatively safe operation, except when a false floor collapsed, burying him waist deep at the next level.

Years ago specimen gold was stored in wheat bags in the underground gold vault.  In the 1930s one 6 kg specimen of gold was found in the hills behind Wildildie and there were other finds almost as good.  Kevin has encountered some small richer deposits and some veins average 300 ounces per ton in the old diggings.  Kevin uses the old 10 stamp crusher that originally came from Mt Grainger near Oddlawirra in 1933.  It accepts ore up to 4 inches in diameter, crushing it to sand.  This is then washed down over large amalgam plates, copper sheets covered in mercury to which the gold grains attach.  This is then retorted, evaporating off the mercury, leaving a gold ‘sponge’, which is then melted into a gold bar.

During its busy phase in the 1930s Mongolata had a cluster of miners living nearby, with a general store and post office, with mail delivered twice a week and fortnightly church services.
