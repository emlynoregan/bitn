Letter.  Karen O’Brien writes about Nathaniel O’Brien (8), saying he sang for the ‘Touchdown’ production on 6 December, entertaining the people of Burra, the Miss Popularity contestants and the production crew at Morphett’s Enginehouse prior to the elimination of one of the girls.  He also sang in his own home to winner Jesse, which will be televised back in New Zealand.

‘Hope you can print this as an encouragement to all young talented performers.’
