A procession then crossed the bridge comprising the Band, Members of the town Council, MPs, Main Road Board, two trollies lent by T.F. Robertson the railway carrier, laden with wheat and Unicorn beer and then other vehicles.  They then returned across the bridge and were photographed by Messrs Bentley and Thomas.  There are eight spans of c. 30‚Äù with piers made of three rolled steel piles braced together with steel crossheads and masonry abutments.  The openings are each spanned by five rolled steel girders carrying jarrah decking metalled over.  The three central girders are tested to ten tons and the outside ones to five tons.  At 1 p.m. a banquet was enjoyed at the Bon Accord Hotel.  The three politicians present made speeches with undoubtedly pointed remarks in them and there were the usual toasts.
