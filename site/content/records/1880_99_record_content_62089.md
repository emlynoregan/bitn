Advt.  Luke Day has been appointed agent for T.R. Meinrath, Bottle Merchant of Adelaide, to buy marine store goods – bottles, bones etc.

[The advt. also denies that ‘a man named Lewis’ has any right to operate in my [Day’s] name – ‘I have no connection whatever with him.’  It would be interesting to know if this Lewis was the Aaron Lewis, a coloured man and marine store dealer, who featured so prominently in a court case in 1893: see the paper of 3 May 1893.]
