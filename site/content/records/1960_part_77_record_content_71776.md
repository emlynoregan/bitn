A telephone exchange was established c. 1920.  When Mr Syd Robinson took over the Hanson store in August 1948 the office moved there and operated until last Friday â€“ the last working day before 30 June.  He and Mrs Robinson have given sterling service to the district over the past 26 years.  They will continue to live at Hanson in retirement; the store having been closed several years ago.
