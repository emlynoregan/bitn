The New Lamps.  A new arc lamp and three ‘Best’ lamps have arrived.  The arc light has been placed on the corner of Henderson’s blacksmith’s shop and the ‘Best’ lamps are in front of the Institute, on the bridge near Hon. J. Lewis’s, at Neville’s corner and on the Black Bridge.  [Which unaccountably makes four!]  All of them are giving trouble, but Mr J. Harvey the lamplighter expects they will yet give a good light.
