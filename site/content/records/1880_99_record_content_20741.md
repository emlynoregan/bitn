Obituary.  The Rev. J.Y. Simpson said at her funeral that the late Mrs Bickford was born at Dodbrook in South Devon in 1813.  After working for some years in SA the couple returned to England in 1876 owing to Mr Bickford’s ill health. They returned to SA in 1879 and laboured at Port Adelaide and Burra before settling at Parkside in 1884.  Mrs Bickford died after a long illness.  She had a long history of service to Aboriginals.
