H.J. Dunn has recently retired after serving 50 continuous years as a Councillor and 47 as chairman.  He served 26 years as Chairman of the Waterloo DC and when Waterloo was amalgamated in 1932 he then served as Chairman of the Saddleworth Dc until his retirement on 30 June last.  In the last five years of service he had retired to Glenelg, but made the 70-mile trip to Saddleworth each month.  He received an MBE in 1947 for service to Local Government and for patriotic activities.  In conjunction with his son Kevin, of Black Springs, he built up the stud known as ‘Barton Hill.’
