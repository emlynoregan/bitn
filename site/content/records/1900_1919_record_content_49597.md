Obituary.  Mr D. [David] Radford died at his residence ‘Condellara’ in Aberdeen last Thursday [15 February] aged 80.  He was born 4 April 1836 at Exeter, Devonshire.  The following year his parents migrated to Australia with their family of six sons and three daughters in the Prestonjee Homanjee  [Pestonjee Bomajee] with Lt-Col. George Gawler on board.  They arrived at Holdfast Bay 12 October 1838.  After four years in Adelaide they went first to Encounter Bay and then to Greenock where they raised sheep.  This was successful at first, but later failed due to scab in the sheep.  In 1852 Mr Radford and some of his brothers went to the Victorian gold fields.  They were successful and returned to SA briefly before a second visit.  The second time they returned to SA by means of a boat they built at Swan Hill.  A few years later Mr Radford prospected with others for gold in New Zealand, but this was unsuccessful and the party suffered privations.  In 1872 he was part of a party led by John Ford to the Northern Territory for the Yam Creek Gold Mining Co.  The Hon. John Lewis was also a member.  Several members lost their lives in the wreck of the Gothenburg, including Mr Thomas Radford.  Mr Radford then turned his attention to farming at Clare and Angaston in partnership with some of his brothers.  In 1879 he took up land near Gordon for sheep farming and later continued in this line to the east of Burra, remaining there till retiring to Burra.  In 1861 he married Martha Smith, daughter of the late Samuel Smith of Angaston, but she died soon, leaving one son and he remarried in 1865, Jane Roberts of Angaston, daughter of the late George Roberts.  He took no part in public life, through a hearing affliction, but he took an interest in the Redruth Methodist Church.  He leaves a widow, five sons and a daughter: S.O. Radford (Durban, South Africa), D.H. Radford (Burra), M.A. Radford (Burra), F.W. Radford (Burra), G.L. Radford (Sydney) and Mrs John Bowman (Leighton).  Also 13 grandchildren.  He was the last of his generation to die.
