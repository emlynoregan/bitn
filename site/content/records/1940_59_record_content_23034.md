‘Bronco’ George White, aged 67, has written from Nedlands, WA, asking to be remembered to old Burra friends.  He spent his youth in Hallett and later worked in the district.  He was a champion buckjump rider, showman colt-breaker and steeplechase rider.  He was also a noted poster artist and musician.  Today he is almost blind, but says he can still stand on his head and perform acrobatics.  He recalls that when he was about seven, his parents went to Burra shopping and in their absence he climbed on the roof of the school, walked all around the guttering and ridge capping and stood on his head on the chimneys, just to amuse the other children.
