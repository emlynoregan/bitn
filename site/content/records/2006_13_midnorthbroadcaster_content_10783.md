Burra Lions Club seems likely to return following a community meeting last week.  The meeting was chaired by Don Pritchard of Clare who reported ‘plenty of interest’.  A follow-up unofficial meeting was scheduled for 6 October at which it is hoped there will be even more active community people keen to re-form the club.  There was considerable interest in involving young people and Yvonne Bradford of Clare spoke about women in Lions.
