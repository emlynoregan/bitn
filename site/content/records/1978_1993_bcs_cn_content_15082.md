Burra Community & Sports Club Inc.

The club is no longer involved in the rubbish pick-up business in Burra.  For the past five years the club has had this contract and rostered two persons on for Burra North and two for Burra collections.  All started at 6 a.m. on Friday mornings; rain or shine.  During the period some 300 persons have participated and they comprised probably the most unique group of ‘garbologists’ in Australia, coming from all walks of life.  They included doctors, lawyers, policemen, nurses, domestic staff, mechanics, stock firm people, teachers, semi-drivers, ETSA & Telecom workers and many more.  Andy & Leslie Phillips made their trailer available every Friday.  Thank you to all who were involved.
