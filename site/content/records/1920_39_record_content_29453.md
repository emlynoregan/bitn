Burra Town Council, 7 January

Road signs are to be erected at G. Roger’s corner pointing to Adelaide, Clare etc.  [Cactus Farm]

And also in Market Square, though funds did not permit one at Sara’s Corner.

[This follows the visit of an Inspector (of what is not stated) and the source of funds is not stated.]

Council was invited to the opening of the Aberdeen Croquet Club on Saturday 16 February.

Mr M. Collins submits his resignation as President of the Memorial Committee and Roll of Honour Committee.

The Inspector again referred to the inadequacies of the water supply.

Cr Woollacott moved that a deputation wait on the Minister.

Cr Woollacott then disputed the Mayor’s ruling that a Councillor could not bring forward any work at a Council meeting – it could only come through the Public Works Committee.

Cr Woollacott accused the Mayor of not putting the motion re the Finance Committee report ‘fairly and squarely’.

The Mayor insisted he withdraw.  Cr Woollacott said he had ‘twisted the thing’. 

The Mayor insisted he withdraw ‘twisted’. 

Eventually Cr Woollacott withdrew.

The Town Clerk said Cr Woollacott had paid men on Christmas Cheer work £33-1-2, but had not put in the correct form for the Government to credit them.
