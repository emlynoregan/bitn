Burra Burra DC has expressed concerns re design features of the new Burra Swimming Pool.

They are concerned it has an inadequate ballast tank, causing increased costs due to water loss and possible damage to the new filtration plant.  A report was presented to SACON last week and Council expects that the fault will be remedied before next season at no cost to either the Council or BCS.
