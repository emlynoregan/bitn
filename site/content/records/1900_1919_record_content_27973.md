Mc Brides Homes.  Five cottage homes built opposite the Kooringa Methodist Church by Mr J.M. McBride for the use of the poor were opened on 24 October by Rev. Vivian Roberts, President-elect of the Methodist church of SA.  The site was previously occupied by old mine cottages for over 50 years.  The new ones were built by John Pearce & Sons to Mr McBrideâ€™s orders.  Mr & Mrs McBride attended, Mr McBride handing over the keys.
