John Shipard writes complaining that ratepayers in Goyder are not getting value for money.

He writes a second letter in response to an advertisement seeking public comment on the naming of the park at Burra North located by Smelts Road, Ludgvan St and The Crescent.

[At least from the establishment of the playground there in 1923 this area was known as Lowe Park.  It was named after Mr Charles Lowe 1854-1925.  Until 1921 he lived at Redruth where he had a bakery near to the park.  He was also a member of the Town Council, representing North Ward from December 1907 to November 1913.]

Mr Shipardâ€™s advice was to subdivide the area adjacent to the derelict tennis courts into six new housing blocks for sale to the public.  This would provide housing in Burra where there is a genuine shortage as well as generating employment.  The completed development should then be named the Scroop Estate.

In the light of a response in issue of 8 August this needs more detail
