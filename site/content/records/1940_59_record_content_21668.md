Red Cross Drive.  A meeting at Burra Institute on Friday night decided to elect two Queens for a Red Cross Drive to be completed by 30 June.  Mrs A. Tennant said there had been Red Cross drives in the past two years and the men had taken over most of the work of doing so. A letter from the Burra Centenary Committee asked that no subscriptions be solicited by Red Cross after 30 June, so as to give the committee a chance to make the Centenary Celebrations a success.  Mr Marston said the letter had been discussed at length and the Committee was fully behind the Red Cross, but felt that the town had supported the Red Cross and the FFCF splendidly for many years and it was now time to do something for the town.  Mr Bevan agreed and said with so much money raised and leaving the town, businesspeople were complaining that business was falling off.  He understood that the Red Cross and FFCF had considerable funds invested in bonds etc.

Miss Rogers said Burra was in the Urban Section of Red Cross and any drive organised could continue to 11 August and Burra had to elect at least one queen or not be credited with any funds raised during the year.  Mrs Tennant said there had been a drive every year and Burra should continue to support the Red Cross.  The drive should run to the middle of July because the FFCF drive was still in progress.

The Mayor said Burra had done a lot for the nation and was behind all patriotic movements, but he felt it would be a gracious act for the Red Cross and FFCF to stand down for now and allow Burra to celebrate its centenary in a fitting manner.  At the end of those celebrations the people would again support them.  After further discussion it was finally resolved that two Queens be nominated and that the three Red Cross Branches in the town work quietly until 30 June.
