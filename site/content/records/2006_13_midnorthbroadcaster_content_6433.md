A Kitchen Garden Program costing some $12.8 million has been launched in primary schools nationwide.  It caused Don Lloyd to recall his teacher Colin Morrison launching a garden patch at Burra Primary in 1947.  The school sold cabbages, cauliflowers, lettuce, broad beans and turnips to raise money for the then non-existent Primary School Library.
