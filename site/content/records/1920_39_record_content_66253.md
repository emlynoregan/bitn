Car Accident.  On Easter Monday morning between 10.30 and 11 a.m. on the road leading to Diprose’s Bridge three miles east of Burra a motor buckboard driven by Keith Lower of Kooringa collided with a car driven by Hugh S.T. Warnes of Chalk Cliffs Station.  Mr Lower had with him his tiny son and daughter and Mr H. Hood – all on the front seat.  They received only minor injuries.  Mr Warnes suffered facial injuries and severe bruising and is in Burra Hospital.  The head-on collision badly damaged the front ends of both vehicles.  Stan Woollacott came across the scene and drove the injured to the hospital.
