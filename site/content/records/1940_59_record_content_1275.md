Burra Rifle Club held a small bore competition in aid of the Trench Comforts Funds.  There was a good attendance and as well as the men there were quite a number of women who gave ample proof of their abilities as rattling good shots.  The Comfort Funds will benefit to the extent of Â£4-10-0.  [Results are printed.]
