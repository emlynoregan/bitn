Up Town Gallery is the name for a new art gallery being established by retired couple Julie & Tom Marshall who have recently moved to the town from Charters Towers in N. Queensland.  Julie said she had always wanted to own her own gallery.  They have spent the last couple of months renovating the historic building [formerly part of Sara’s store at Burra North] that now boasts several large viewing rooms.  The gallery was officially opened on Saturday and the event was well attended by locals and visitors alike.  [Photo of owners in the gallery.]
