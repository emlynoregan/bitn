Proposed Caroona Creek Conservation Park

A biological survey of the area by the Department for the Environment & Heritage and the SA Museum and local volunteers in late October revealed three previously unrecorded lizard species and Bolam’s Mouse, a native, but sparsely distributed species – listed as endangered in NSW and presumed extinct in Victoria.

Lizard species were:

The Pink Blotched Gecko

Broad-banded Sandswimmer

Western Bluetongue

The park lies c. 50 km north of Burra on the western edge of the Olary Plain and contains the Tooralie Gorge.  The discovery of the lizards is a range extension for their species.
