About 50 members attended the first AGM on Saturday.  K.C. Sandland Senior Vice-President took the chair.  The state executive was represented by three members.

Dr Steele was elected President and Vice-Presidents were S.M. Lane & Messrs Swift and C. Jones.

Mr Fearby outlined plans for the election of a state executive and said the League had grown from 2,747 members in 1 January 1918 to c. 13,000 on 30 June 1919, or 92% of all returned soldiers.

The Burra Branch had 140 members and in the past year income had been £525-8-6 and expenses £393.  There was £221 in hand, but, said Mr Broderick, a problem loomed.  Much of the income in the first year came from donations and this would not continue.  Subscriptions were only £40 and £100 had been spent in salaries.  Business methods would need to be employed.

Mr Sandland said this attack was unwarranted and no money had been squandered.

Mr Lane said he didn’t think Mr Broderick’s remarks were intended as an attack, but merely raised the question whether it was possible to continue with subscriptions only.

Mr Carter said Mr Broderick obviously thought they could not afford a paid secretary

Mr Broderick said he was not criticising the secretary or the executive, but they must try to arrange finances so ordinary expenditure was met from ordinary revenue.

Miss Dorothy Hawkes was presented with a certificate of appreciation for work done for the branch.

The Secretary’s report reveals expenses for the year of £90 for salaries and £11-10-0 for expenses.  Cash donations were £65 and furniture donations worth £168.  £27 for repairs was paid by the building’s owners, representing the first year’s rent.
