Burra Benevolent Society, 13 December

President J. Thomas was welcomed back after a serious illness.  Some very useful parcels of clothing have been received and are acknowledged.  Some 28 or more names were set down for a Christmas box of 7/6 each; a nice help to brighten the lives of the elderly at this season.
