Burra Swimming Pool.  The proposed pool will cost over £1,000. Mr Golding, architect will supervise.  The Government has supplied £400 and local donations and promises have increased this to £550 so far.  Before we start we need at least £800.  Next Friday we start a mile of pennies when the Mayor will start at Bence’s corner and lay 240 pennies donated by Clarkson’s Ltd.
