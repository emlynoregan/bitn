Agricultural produce was very good this year.

Dairy produce was much better than last year and one of the finest displays ever in Burra.

Home made sweets were very good.

Poultry was much improved this year though there were few pigeons.

Draught stock was well represented.

Ring events were delayed by the luncheon until 2 p.m. and marred by the rain after 3 p.m.

Cattle were poorly represented and pigs also very limited.

Dog exhibits were up and of good quality, especially the greyhounds.

Sheep, as mentioned, were excellent, the competition was keen and the judging difficult.

Agricultural implements were well represented.
