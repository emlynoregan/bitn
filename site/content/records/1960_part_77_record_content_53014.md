Burra Mine

The Mine area has been closed to the public for safety reasons.  Large earth-moving machinery is moving through the area.  Recently a near fatal accident occurred when a big fully-laden water tanker was climbing out and encountered tourists heading down in a car.  The car driver did not reverse out and it was only with difficulty that the truck driver was able to engage reverse gear and control its descent to the bottom.  It could have careered out of control to the depths below.  Once the eastern side is fenced the District Council will complete new scenic roads to enable operations to be observed.  A new access road ahs been opened to the rubbish tip from opposite the hospital and the Burra North access has been closed.

Mining equipment is arriving at the Burra Railway Station.  New site offices will arrive tomorrow.  Building of offices, amenities block, control rooms and magazines will be carried out by Jaxon Constructions Ltd.  McMahon Constructions Pty Ltd will be responsible for earthworks and concrete construction – both are subcontractors for T.C. O’Connor & Sons.  Roche Bros are building the main haulage road for the quarry or mine to the primary crushing area and the main Fines Dam.  They have been moving 4-5,000 yards a day and it will be necessary to move another 140-150,000 yards to provide a cutting down to the mine.
