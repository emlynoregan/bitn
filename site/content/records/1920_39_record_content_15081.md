Mr Reed was presented with a bound address.

Mrs W.H. Gare unveiled a memorial tablet.

In September 1915 Mrs Gare began a monthly collection towards the building.  Though the sum raised was not large it had kept the project ever before the minds of them all.  The tablet read:

‘Methodist Memorial Sunday School.  This building was erected in honour of the oast Officers and Teachers of this school 1924.’

In the entry hall are life-size portraits of Mr Ben Preece, the founder and Mr A.H. Forder the first secretary.  Also two Rolls of Honour showing 58 scholars who had enlisted for service in the Great War and that twelve had made the supreme sacrifice.

The assembly hall is 46 ft x 35 ft and 18 ft high and will accommodate over 300.  The platform at the northern end is 20 ft x 9 ft and 33 ft high.  On the eastern side are five classrooms: four are 13 ft x 9 ft and the fifth is 12 ft x 13 ft.  On the western side another entrance leads into the library 13½ ft x 9ft and this opens into the secretary’s office 13 ft x 12 ft and from that into a crush hall 19¼ ft x 12 ft on the northern end of which is the ladies cloakroom, lavatories etc.  West of the hall are the Kindergarten and Beginners Departments: the first 25 ft x 25 ft and the second 16 ft x 13 ft.  The Primary Department is north of the hall and in the northeast corner is the kitchen 13 ft x 13 ft.

Speeches were then given by the visiting clergy.  After the meeting in the hall a tea meeting was held in Jubilee Hall and in the evening a first class concert was given in the new hall.

On Sunday the morning service was held in the church and Rev. W.J. Mortimer preached.  At 2.30 p.m. there was a short farewell service in Jubilee Hall conducted by Mr E.W. Dunhill.  At 3 p.m. Rev. W.J. Mortimer conducted a service in the new Sunday school and in the evening he preached there again to a crowded room.  At the conclusion of the evening Mr James Reed handed over a cheque of something over £70 which more than covered the outstanding deficiency.  Miss Bubb on behalf of the Soldiers’ Aid Society presented a beautiful brass jardiniere as a tribute for the society’s use of Jubilee Hall.

The report includes a photograph of James Reed.
