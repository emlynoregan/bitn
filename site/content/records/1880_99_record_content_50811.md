Burra Town Council.

The Mayor reported that the Finance Committee was satisfied they were in a very satisfactory position.

Cr Hardy asked if the Mayor had seen the report in the Record stating that No. 2 Reserve at Redruth is now planted with trees.

Crs Linkson & Walsh pay in expenses, which amounted to £1-18-0 less than last year.

‘This should be looked into and no doubt it will.’

The Mayor thought it an unfair statement and said a number of trees planted last year were growing.

Cr Linkson said ‘Only ten.’

The Mayor: ‘and the number planted this year is 100 less.

Cr Linkson: 80.

The Mayor considered it unfair representation and maintained that last year the trees were properly planted with proper tools ‘this year it was only ‘pig-muzzled, and the trees were thrown in.’
