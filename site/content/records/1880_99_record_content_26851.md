Waterworks

These have been under the Town Council control for nearly three years on a lease from the Government and they have this year made a considerable loss due to:

Decreased consumption due to falling population

Decreased consumption due to a wet year

The Railways Department reverting to using its own well for engine water

Costs have been reduced somewhat, but the Government interest could not be reduced and it is presently 5%.

Railway consumption would turn the deficit into a credit, but the Mayor has been unable to achieve that and an analysis of the two sources of water supports the Railway Department’s choice.

Mr Holder saw no alternative but to ‘throw up the lease’, though that will be a decision for the newly elected council.

‘I would advise that the lease should be renewed for three months to enable the Council to make up the deficit of £142-12-9 which now exists, and then finally surrendered.’

‘A sum of £249 is due to the Government, but the current water account assets and outstandings balance this.
