Burra North Red Cross Circle Formed.  Many felt that more could be done if there were a separate circle at Burra North because many found it impossible to get to meetings at Burra.  The new circle would meet on the first and third Wednesday s of each month in the Aberdeen Croquet Hall at 2.45 p.m.  Mrs F. Sara has been elected President.
