Burra Town Council

The report of the meeting gives a somewhat fuller account, but is essentially the same as in the editorial.

Mr & Mrs W.H. Turner were given a valedictory social at the Bible Christian Church last Monday.  They are residents of 30 years with 28 years connection with the church.  A substantial meal was followed by speeches at a public meeting attended by over 100 with Rev. E.J. Kemp in the chair.  They were presented with an address and an enlarged photo of each.

A Firing Match at World’s End last week saw 5 civilians narrowly defeat 5 members of the Burra MR.

The Cantata, Mildred & Patty is reviewed in over 1 column and highly praised.  The Institute hall was crowded.

School Floral & Art Exhibition prize list is printed.

Bible Christian Church Trustees for the last seven years have paid £25 p.a. plus the interest, leaving a debt of £225 on the large church.
