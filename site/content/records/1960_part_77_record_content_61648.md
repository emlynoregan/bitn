Burra Burra DC will celebrate its centenary to coincide with the Copper Festival.  The District Council was proclaimed 28 November 1872.  The Town Council did not appear until June 1876.  The first meeting of the DC was in S. Drew & Co.’s office on 9 December 1872.  Cr Isaac Killicoat was appointed Chairman.  Other Councillors were H. Dawson, S. Drew, J. Dunstan & D. McCulloch.  J. Dunstan Jun. was appointed Clerk pro tem.  Meetings were held on alternate Thursday s at 10 a.m. with the second meeting in the old Burra Hotel.  On 26 December 1872 J.D. Cave was appointed District Clerk and Collector at $150 p.a.  Messrs Cave & Goodfellow were appointed assessors at $40 each.  On 10 March 1973 Mr Tiver’s offer of two rooms at $48 p.a. was accepted for one month as the DC office.  On 6 February 1873 it was decided to call tenders for an office in suitable premises in Aberdeen, Redruth or Kooringa.  On 30 September 1873 the Secretary of the Institute advised that the Council could use the Institute for meetings at $40 p.a. provided the agreement was for one year.  It was resolved that the offer be accepted provided a new room was built for the clerk’s office by the end of three months.  The clerk was instructed to move furniture, safe etc to the office 23 December 1873 and Council evident met there from that date to the present time.  [This last statement is not correct.]

[The following clearly reprinted an item written in 1935.]

In 1935 the Councillors were as follows:

N.H. Hearse [sic: error for Pearse], elected July 1914, appointed Chairman 1 July 1921 & served as such to the final meeting* – a period of 21 years.

J. Kellock elected 10 June 1916 – 19 years

R. Warnes elected 12 June 1920 – 15 years

E. Finch elected 29 October 1921 – 14 years

H.W. Tiver elected 4 July 1924 – 11 years

W.H. McWaters elected 4 July 1925 – 10 years

G.G. Hawkes elected 15 July 1927 – 8 years

[* This apparent anomaly in referring to a last meeting in 1935 for an institution having its centenary in 1972 occurs because from 1872 to 1935 there was a District Council of Burra.  In 1935 the District Council of Burra Burra was formed by the merger of the DCs of Burra, Hanson, Booborowie & Mt Bryan.]

A.A. Davey was appointed Clerk 9 July 1910 and held the position for 25 years.  J.J. Parker was appointed Overseer 10 June 1921 and held it to the present – 14 years.

The final meeting of the Booborowie DC was held 29 April 1935.  Offers to buy the Council furniture were refused as too low.  The chair of the Council was presented to the Booborowie Hall Committee.  The Council recorded a minute that it strongly disapproved of the amalgamation of the district and was not satisfied with the findings of the commission, as the Council was large enough to function on its own.  It was resolved that the Clerk be supplied with a reference.  The Council would have been 60 years old on 5 May.

The final meeting of the Burra DC was on 26 April 1935.  With the merging of Councils the new body comprised: I.J. Warnes as Chairman with Councillors H.C. Atkins, J. Kellock, A.D. McDonald, E. Finch, H.E. Edwards, F.G. Scholz and T.J. Wedding, with G. Powell as Clerk and Overseer.

Aberdeen Oval has recently been improved.  More parking space with a good view has been made available, but now some people at the end of the match are driving across the oval instead of using the tracks provided.  On a wet day this could spoil the surface for the rest of the season.  The cost of erecting fencing would be an unnecessary expense.

Burra Burra DC will borrow $10,000 at 6.2% as a debenture loan over 10 years, to finance the new toilets and office additions, which will include a fire-proof strong room, a storage room and an office machinery room.  The public conveniences will open onto Chapel Street.

The Highways Department is acquiring land at Farrell Flat to remove the sharp bend at the end of the Farrell Flat by-pass.
