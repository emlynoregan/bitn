The Burra Creek is riddled like a honeycomb.  From the bridge a fine view of the Mine on the west and of the Smelting Works on the east is obtained.  Both are astonishing, given the age of the place; less than five years.

I took up my quarters at the residence of the hospitable clergyman and sallied forth to visit the place.  From the top of the hill the whole Mine with its pumping engine, numerous shafts, whims, jigging sheds and appurtenances, beds of assorted ores, men and animals, noise and activity, burst upon my view.

I descended one of the shafts 35 fathoms and, accompanied an obliging miner with a candle in one hand, now stooping, now crawling, now ascending, now descending through gallery, pit, adit, level etc.  The commentary suggested that the mine had been sinking, filling up places and rendering some very dangerous.  The ore seemed to be mixed with the earth, not in veins.

I then inspected the jigging sheds – jiggers are simply an oblong box sieve suspended, holding a barrowful of ore, connected with a handle, which is jerked up and down by a man, the sieve being in a pool of water, constantly supplied by a stream which runs through the whole shed, and coming from the engine shaft.  The engine is a ponderous piece of machinery which drains the whole mine of about five acres.  It drives three or four pumps, the largest with a bore of nine inches and the depth of the shaft is 45 fathoms.  It supplies water, which is of quite good quality, to Kooringa, Aberdeen and Redruth.

28 December 1850.  I visited the Patent Copper Company Works; a mass of buildings with nineteen furnaces at work.  I saw the process of casting.  A row of iron moulds are placed around the furnace; one or two men fill them with the smelted ore; no all at once, but at six different times, each time with an iron ladle holding fourteen pounds; this is poured in, cools immediately; another is supplied and so on, until the six are completed.  They are then turned out, separated, and their edges cleaned by boys and men.  There is a sawmill attached for cutting the firewood to the required lengths.  In the large yard adjacent the ore is mixed before smelting with the proper proportions of coal, iron ore and limestone; the whole being reduced to the size of pigeons’ eggs.  From thence it is conveyed to a large funnel over each furnace.

We then visited one of the holes in the creek and found it very neat and clean and in one part an attempt at finery.  It was very cool, but I was informed, very close at night, there being no ventilation.  They are whitewashed inside and sometimes outside and most have paling verandahs, lean-tos etc.  The chimneys are mere holes opening from the footpath above, with a tub or two and a few clods put round.  As you pass you always know what is being cooked and there are many tales of fish or fowl disappearing up a chimney, having been hooked by a practical joker.  The secret of selecting such a place is that it is rent free.  Sickness prevails much and it is no wonder; the refuse is cast before the door.  Pigs and children were numerous.

All the houses are built of substantial stone, but irregularly disposed, something like Adelaide of ten years ago.  Rent is high, 10/- for two or three rooms and water 2/- a load.

The general currency is orders from the two great companies.  Also the Aberdeen Hotel issues and Hutchings and a host of grocers.  This is certainly a bad system and the only excuse is the scarcity of cash.  A branch bank is most desirable.

29 December.  I went to church in the morning and evening.  At present it is in a temporary place, the future schoolroom.  The Wesleyans are the strongest body.

30 December.  I was up at 4 a.m. for a start for Adelaide and we left a little before 6 a.m. with rain.  It was a miserable day with pouring rain from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m., wretched horses and worse roads.  Sod Hut, which is a stone building; Apoinga Mine, Tothill Scrub and Sheoak Log, which is a stone house, scarcely excited a look and so at length to the warmth of Mr Young’s Hotel at Gawler.

31 December 1850.  Up early to travel to Adelaide, arriving at 1.30 p.m.

W.A.C.
