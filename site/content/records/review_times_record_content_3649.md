BCS.  Four students from the schoolâ€™s Student Representative Council will attend a course run in December at the Burra campus of TAFE on how to run meetings.

It has been decided that the existing brown windcheater will remain as an option for students, with the jumper being used for more formal occasions.

Principal Mr R. Henderson has been appointed principal of Oakbank Area School.  The new principal at Burra will be Mr M. Day, presently principal of Coober Pedy Area School.

An outbreak of Rubella among primary school students has now been cleared up.  At one point about two thirds of one junior primary class had been affected at the same time.

Rubella vaccinations for Year 8 students would probably be in March next year.

Two students, Petrea Piggott of Year 9 and Justin Hall of Year 12, have been chosen in the State Team for the National All School Athletics Championships to be held in Sydney in December.

Petrea also qualified for the Under 16 national championships in Adelaide next March.
