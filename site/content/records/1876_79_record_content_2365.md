Letter to Ed.

Sir.

To say that there is not a lot of low-lived thieves prowling about the neighbourhood of Redruth would be something untrue. Last night at about half past eight, as my daughter went out the back door to bring in clothes from the line, one of these midnight marauders suddenly made a bolt from under the line, and in his haste tumbled down at the end of the house. The girl immediately told me. I at once rushed for my revolver, but true to his colours, when I went out he was non est.  I would caution him not to make his appearance there again, or I will shoot him down like a dog.

I am, Sir & c., REVOLVER Redruth, May 31, 1877.
