Football.

[To add to the confusion of last weekâ€™s report a reprint of details of the Football Carnival at Mallala gives the final scores as North-Eastern 13.1 defeated Barossa Light 11.7, which is also not near the margin cited last week, and not the figures quoted either.]

Basketball

Hallett 32 defeated Burra Comrades 23

Spalding 8 defeated Terowie 7

Leighton 14 defeated Booborowie 12

Burra Rovers 48 defeated Yarcowie 8

In a lightning carnival at Booborowie on 15 June Terowie 11 defeated Booborowie 3 in the final.
