Obituary.  Josiah Thomas who died at ‘Three Trees’ near Burra on 15 May had lived in the area continuously for 81 years.  He was born in the parish of Whendron at Forestgate near Redruth, Cornwall on 6 March 1845, the youngest son of the late Mr & Mrs John Thomas.  They migrated to SA in 1848 on the William Money.  Though not quite 3 when they arrived Mr Thomas had a hazy recollection of being carried ashore by sailors.  Mr Thomas Sen. had an engagement as an underground manager at the Burra Mine and they went directly there by horse dray which was rather quicker than a bullock dray.  They lived first in a paling house at the mine and he was educated by Mr H.N. Thompson, a clerk at the mine.  At 10 he went to work and at 18 his father died leaving him ‘Three Trees’.  He was always a great reader.  He was a successful grazier and farmer despite the setbacks of droughts, fires etc.  Mr & Mrs Thomas celebrated their diamond wedding on 11 January 1929.  [An error: see below.]  They were married in the old Church of England near where Mr G.H. Dow’s residence now stands in 1851 [sic: clearly an error because they were married 15 February 1869.]
