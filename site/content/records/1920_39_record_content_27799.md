Fracas in a Fish Shop.  Mr N. Antonas who has recently begun business with a fish and chip shop in Young St was the victim of an unprovoked attack.  Three men, John Patrick Bambery, Henry Morris and Arthur Henry Dowd came to the shop for a fish supper about 9.30 p.m. on Friday evening.  They had been drinking and with little warning Bambery attacked Antonas with a chair and Morris joined in.  When Antonas escaped out the back door Bambery and Morris set about destroying the property.  The front window and every other were smashed, the furniture broken, a dresser pulled over and a large amount of crockery was broken.  At Court J.G. Sara postmaster of Aberdeen gave evidence of the affray.  Sgt McDonald gave evidence of the capture of the defendants and of the damage.

L.R. Fuss, contractor, gave evidence of the damage done to the building which he estimated at c. Â£10.

Bambery & Morris were remanded for sentence at the criminal sessions.

Dowd, who had not taken part, was charged with having no visible means of support and sentenced to 14 days in Adelaide Jail.
