Interview with Len Bence

Len says he wishes he had been born in the period of Pissarro, Monet and Van Gogh.  The early impressionists got away from detail and produced a style Len Loves.  When he taught oil painting, he would give students a brief look at a painting and then ask them to go away and paint it – they would have only an impression of the image to fall back upon.

Watercolour is Mr Bence’s first preference, but it is difficult and requires great care, as a single mistake screws up the work.  Painting in oils is more relaxing – mistakes can be scraped off and corrected.  His favourite subjects have been landscapes in Italy and France, but he also loved Burra scenes and its lovely bluestone buildings.  About 30 years ago he sold the Drew & Crewes Building in Commercial Street and he and his wife Muriel then ran a gallery in a cottage on Bridge Terrace [in Paxton Square].  At that time it was in poor condition and without electricity – but they did well for some years.  He enjoys sketching outdoors, rather than from photographs.  Painting has been an occupation and a hobby and he says you needed to view it as a job to be done, even if at times you didn’t feel like it.  [Photo.]
