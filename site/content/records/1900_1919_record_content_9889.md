Rev. W.F. James was farewelled at a tea-meeting at Jubilee Hall on 5 April.  W.A. Rabbich, as senior warden, presided.  An illuminated address was presented.  The Rev. James’s achievements in three years have been extensive repairs to buildings, a reduction in church debts, the enlargement of the late Primitive Methodist Church and its renaming as Jubilee Hall, for Sunday school use.  The Wesley Bicentenary Church at Hanson was built and opened free of debt.  Over £800 has been raised by special effort.  Membership has risen.  Thanks were also extended to Mrs James and their son Alfred for their help in many ways.
