Trip to Robertstown. Described in some detail by a correspondent.

The drought had reduced rabbit numbers considerably.

World's End P.O. is little used as it is out of the way, but will doubtless soon move to the new township [Lapford] which has just been surveyed 14 miles from Kooringa near the Burra Creek.

At World's End the creek is clean and fresh with beautiful gums. Crops from here on were better.

At Spring Hut Creek there was good water at 2 feet all year and several settlers use this resource in summer.

There was ripe oats here in sheaves.

Emu Flat in H. of English is 3 miles by 15 miles and has clumps of mallee, gums and pine.

Brady Creek empties onto it and there is a lagoon which last winter extended to 200 acres and attracted ducks.

This area had beautiful wheat paddocks.

On the north side of the flat is Robertstown.

Mr J. Roberts, formerly of Kooringa has a good stock of goods and runs the P.O. with mail 3 times a week to Marrabel.

There is a blacksmith and wheelwright, but as yet no hotel.

The German chapel has all services in German and the small Bible Christian Chapel on the western side of the plain is connected with Kapunda Station, but is now closed.

Mr. Roberts has agreed to let Primitive Methodist services be held in his house until a chapel is built.

Redruth Bridge. The Midland Road Board surveyor found rotten planks and ribs and while no immediate danger, it needs repair and a warning sign should be erected in the meantime. It should be replaced with an iron bridge of the bow string type. The present span is 7I'3" and locals say this is insufficient in floods and causes water to build up behind it.
