Businessman Dick Smith has established a fund to restore the Mt Bryan East birthplace of Sir Hubert Wilkins.  A local body has been formed to oversee the project, with a major event planned for October next year.  Mr Smith has raised $50,000 through an appeal in the Australian Geographic Magazine.  The house is to be thoroughly restored through the National Trust.  It lies on land owned by Brian Guthrie, which Mr Smith has offered to buy out of his own pocket.
