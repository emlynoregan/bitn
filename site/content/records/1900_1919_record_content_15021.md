Burra Mine

The reporter was told by Mr Pryor, the manager, that it has been decided to pump water from the open cut to a depth of 50ft.  The contract is understood to have been signed and the operations will begin in a couple of months.  This is a commendable action.  This will enable work to be done on a huge body of ore that was passed in the last drive and expose what ore was in sight when the mine shut down.  About 20 tons of ore has been sent away – estimated at 20% – from the drive being developed.  The result of the pumping will decide if it is worthwhile putting in the machinery to treat the ore here.  The directors are hopeful and intend to lose no opportunity that the pumping discloses.  Residents are looking forward to good times and a revival of the town, though it is not likely much progress can be made before the New Year.
