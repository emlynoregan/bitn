Advt.  Authorised by Andrew S. Gerrand urging no change to the licensing arrangements for hotels and against the prohibition push in the Local Option Poll on 26 March.  If, he says, the move to reduce licenses is carried, one third of each class of licence (hotel, storekeeperâ€™s or club) in the district so voting, will go in 12 months, and a licence holder would receive not one penny compensation.
