Deputation to the Minister of Local Government

Following the public meeting at Booborowie over the increase in rates, a deputation has waited on the Minister, the Hon. G.T. Virgo.  They pointed out that grants to the Burra Burra Council have decreased by $50,000 over three years.  They sought increased funding to enable the budget to balance without the current increase in rates.  The increase in rates was a response to the sharp decline in Government grants for road works.  As a result of the previous Government policy the Council had built up an efficient plant and staff and incurred debts in the purchase of equipment, which had to be serviced.  The deputation had complete confidence in the Council, but could not accept the hardship caused by the rate increase. They provided figures to support their claims:

Money collected in rates 	1971-72	$80,370

1972-73	$99,276

Government Road Grants	1969-70	$141,976

1970-71	$131,512 (difference is a carry forward)

1971-72	$107,415

1972-73	$81,990

Comparison of different Council rates within a ten miles radius for similar land:

Burra Burra DC	890 acres	rates $259.76

Adjoining Council	868 acres	rates $134.40

Another adjoining Council	875 acres	rates $265.14

This shows our rates are equal to one and well above the other, showing we are pulling our weight as ratepayers.  The town is awakening to tourism and visitor numbers are growing, but a great need exists for a sealed road in an east-west direction.  There has been a general increase in the revenue allotted to the Highways Department, but the debit orders to the northern areas have remained constant and to the Burra Burra Council have been reduced.  Rate income must be reduced by $20,000.

This can only be done by:

Reducing the rural activities of Council.

Disposal of plant and equipment.

Retention of plant and equipment, but operating on a reduced scale with retrenchment of five or six men.

Highways Department provides grant allocation to enable the Council to meet loan and operational commitments until the rural community recovers from the restricted fianc√© that has been and largely still is in place.

The Government supports the Council to provide for tourist activity in Burra as the rural sector has provided the present facilities and services.
