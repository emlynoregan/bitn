Schools’ Exhibition and Sports

On Monday 5 October a procession of children from Burra, Copperhouse, Ayers, Leighton, Hanson, Gum Creek, the Church of England Day School and St Joseph’s Convent School departed from the Burra Institute to take part in the Burra & District Schools’ Centenary Exhibition. Nearly 800 children marched to the strains of the Burra and Leighton Schools’ Drum and Fife Bands.  Burra School presented a Tableau on a lorry depicting the ceremony at the Old Gum Tree when SA was declared a colony.  Copperhouse School had a float illustrating work on the Burra Burra Copper Mine at Morphett’s and Ayers’ Shafts.  This was awarded first prize.

At the Burra school steps the President of the Burra School Committee, Mr A.B .Riggs, welcomed the Minister of Education, Mr Jefferies.  The Mayor made supporting remarks and the Minister responded before declaring the Exhibition open.  Dr Steele moved a vote of thanks and was supported by Mr G.F. Jenkins MP.  The visitors then moved inside to the exhibition of work.  The large junior room held displays from the various primary schools.   [These are then described at some length.]

The Burra High School had a particularly interesting show in the science room where various clever demonstrations were given by the Second Year boys.  In another area various hobbies were displayed.  The Domestic Arts and Woodwork displays were impressive.  In the centre of the Domestic Arts display was a beautifully iced Centenary Cake, the work of the First Year students.  The Second Year girls had set out an invalid’s tray and a traymobile equipped for afternoon tea.

The afternoon was devoted to sports activities from 1 p.m.

[These are described and the results printed in about 1⅔ columns.]
