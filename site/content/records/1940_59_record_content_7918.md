Letter.  Pte Ronald Schaefer writes to Edgar Atkins of Hanson.  He tells of the dismal desert landscape of Egypt.  He was working on the boats involved in the evacuation of Greece.  He was then posted as missing, due to an unfortunate mistake.  He has worked in a General Hospital in Egypt, seen a lot of Alexandria, visited most of the typical tourist sites of Cairo and been swimming in the Mediterranean.  He was then posted to Palestine, which was a much better country than Egypt.  He writes of visiting Haifa, Nazareth, the hills of Galilee and was anticipating a trip to Jerusalem.
