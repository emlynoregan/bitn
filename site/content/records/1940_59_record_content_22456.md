Burra Men’s Branch of the LCL held its annual meeting on Friday in the Eastern Telephone Building.  President Mr O. Finch read the annual report.  He referred first to the progress of the war, the Commonwealth Government and the death of Prime Minister Curtin, the prevailing serious drought and the formation of the Liberal Party of Australia, before moving on to consider local issues.

Locally they had been honoured by the visit of Mr P.A. McBride to outline the perils of the Referendum and urging the necessity of a No vote.  On 27 October Mr M.S. Edwards had resigned after being their secretary for 22 years, due to his leaving the district.  They had also lost the secretary of the Women’s Branch when Miss Wilkinson died.  A plebiscite was currently underway to choose between P.A. McBride and H.H. Shannon to contest the Wakefield Division in the next Federal Elections.

Guest speakers were Mr A.P. Blesing, former Minister of Agriculture and Mr A.D. McDonald MP.  The former spoke mainly on anomalies regarding prevailing wheat prices and the latter on the recent achievements of the state government, especially the Mr Bold Reservoir, the Morgan-Whyalla Pipeline and the development of the Leigh Creek Coal Field. Future problems being addressed included a Government Housing Scheme and the general modernisation of hospitals.
