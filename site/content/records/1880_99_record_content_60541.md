James Fletcher sued his brother William Fletcher for £47 in wages.

James Fletcher said he had been manager of the Bon Accord Hotel from 19 July 1895 to 13 July 1896, when he was dismissed by the licensee W. Fletcher.  He had given up a position of 15½ years as timekeeper with the SAR.  He had no money to invest, but his brother had said come anyway and share the profits of the business.  In February when the tax returns were done his brother instead made up his account amounting to £40 for him and between £20 & £25 for his wife, who had served as a waitress.  He had nothing to do with the banking or the financial side and from February regarded himself as a servant.  He had received sums from his brother amounting to £23-15-0 and £1 since his dismissal.  His wife was dismissed one week later.  Other than this sum he had received only an occasional glass of beer, plus 6d now and then for a hair cut and 3d for shaves.  He said he received £130 p.a. as timekeeper for SAR.

Catherine Fletcher, his wife, had thought her husband was in partnership with William Fletcher until February when she was put on wages of 10/- a week.  She had been a waitress before and considered 10/- a week very low.  She did not have access to the till and very seldom served at the bar.

William Fletcher said he had offered a partnership initially for £50. His brother said he couldn’t, but offered by letter to put in £30.  His brother had access to the till and ordered beer on his own account.  Did not consider he owed anything.  It was not necessary to employ the defendant and his wife’s services were unnecessary.  He did not dismiss his brother, but said one of them would have to go out of the business.

The SM said no agreement had been signed, nor was the plaintiff’s name on the licence.  He found no evidence that any partnership was ever intended and gave a verdict with costs for the full amount claimed.
