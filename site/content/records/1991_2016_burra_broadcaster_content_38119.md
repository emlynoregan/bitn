Feedlot Stopped

The Environment, Resources & Development Court has reversed the Goyder Council’s decision to allow a feedlot to be established on Princess Royal.  Judge Cole ruled on 23 November to uphold an appeal by Graham Whetstone and David Lindner against the decision of Council made on 15 March 2005.  Mr Rowe said he would be appealing the court’s decision.  Council planner John Brak said Council will meet on 20 December and will discuss whether it would participate in any further action.  Judge Cole said the feedlot may be an acceptable land use in the general  farming zone and was sufficiently remote from neighbours that it would not have a direct impact with noise, dust or appearance, but the question of the impact of taking ground water on surface and ground water had not been addressed.  The court had not received evidence from the Observational Wells Network.  Whetstone and Lindner presented evidence of declining water levels in bores and other evidence from expert witnesses suggested the water use presently in the Upper Burra Creek sub-catchment was unsustainable.  The Council had not addressed itself seriously to water use and relied upon the EPA, which had not addressed it either.
