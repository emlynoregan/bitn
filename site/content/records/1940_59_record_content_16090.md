Fire Brigade.  Mr O. Finch has complained to Council that when the recent fire occurred on his property it entered the Town Council area and yet the Fire Brigade did not attend.  As a town ratepayer he felt entitled to its attendance and had the fire not been stopped it would very soon have endangered town buildings.

Cr Lee said the Fire Brigade was not permitted to attend fires beyond the area covered by water mains.  Had the members gone they could not have taken fire fighting equipment with them.

Cr Kellaway said it was heading for the railway cottages and many people thought prevention was better than cure.

It was resolved to get a ruling from the Fire Brigades’ Board on the extent of the Council’s power to order action in such an event.
