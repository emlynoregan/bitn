Kooringa Court, 11 August.

Thomas P. Halls was charged by L=C Thomas with using threatening language in Market Square on 10 August.  He pleaded not guilty.

Mr Howard of the Burra Hotel sent for the police because Halls was causing trouble.  L-C Thomas said Halls had defied him to try and lock him up said:

‘I “done for” one man and I’ll do for you.’

Thomas then said ‘I immediately caught him and threw him and put the handcuff on him.’

Thomas also said there had been a struggle at the cells and the defendant threatened to kill him.  Halls was fined £1 or 14 days on the threatening language charge and £3 or 1 month for assaulting L-C Thomas.  He said he would pay the fine, but asked for one week to pay.
