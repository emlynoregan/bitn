Obituary.  John Quinn Hogan who died 14 March was born at Smithstown in County Clare Ireland in 1842.  He arrived in Australia c. 1870 and went to work for his cousin the late John Hogan of Tarlee for eight years.  In 1878 he married Elizabeth Kain, only daughter of Martin Kain of Hamley Bridge.  He then farmed at Hamley Bridge and Lindley with little success before taking Government contracts, including large ones at Wadnaminga and Cockburn.  About 1890 he took a selection at Leighton.  In 1894 he became clerk and overseer of Booborowie DC and held the office for 22 years.  He had also been the Chairman and Councillor of the DC of Stockport and took a great interest in shows at Tarlee, Kapunda & Burra.  He was active in the Catholic Churches at Tarlee and Booborowie and also in Leighton Hall.  He is survived by a widow and ten children: Messrs J.F. (Booborowie), Martin, Tim, Frank & Patrick (Leighton), Thomas (New Zealand), Michael (Adelaide), John (Hanson), Mrs W.F. McIvoy (Booborowie) & Miss Leah Hogan (Leighton).
