Pte William Arthur Jarmyn who enlisted from Mt Bryan soon after the outbreak of the war has been awarded the Military Medal.  He was one of three brothers who enlisted in the AIF.  The MM was given for outstanding bravery in the Greece-Crete Campaign where he held a bridge with the aid of a machine gun for three days.  He was captured and placed in an Italian POW camp from which he escaped, but was captured and placed in a German POW camp.  He now lives with his mother on Semaphore Road at Exeter.
