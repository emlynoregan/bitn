Mr R.J. Noye of Saddleworth writes an article on the rise and fall of the Apoinga Smelters.

A small piece of cast iron handed in to Saddleworth District Historical Society has proved to be one of the few remaining links with this pioneer local industry.  It is part of an ingot mould from the Apoinga Smelter, which flourished and then died over 100 years ago.

After the discovery of copper at Burra in 1845 a never ending stream of laden bullock drays wound its way to Port Adelaide.  At the wharves it was auctioned and most was purchased by the Swansea (England) [sic] Smelters.  With little or no competition the mines were not receiving a fair price for their ore.  The SA smelter was to be one of the answers to this lack of competition.  The first smelting attempt at Burra failed miserably and some years passed before the town had its own efficient works.  Meanwhile some South Australians with overseas experience and their own patented copper refining process were attracted to the dense forest of peppermint gums then at Tothill’s Scrub about 20 miles south of Burra.  This was an ideal fuel for their smelting furnaces, which at their peak used 150 loads of wood a week.  These men, Penny and Owen, began planning as early as 1847 and in June 1848 they were ready for building to commence and drays carrying fire bricks, clay and ironwork left Adelaide for Tothill’s Scrub.  Batches of Burra ore were bought and in January 1849 the furnaces produced their first batch of molten copper.  The single stage process was claimed to produce copper as tough and fine as any made overseas using up to seven processes.  Later that year works at Burra and Yatala near Pt Adelaide came into production.  Initial difficulties were overcome and by March 1849 a ton of copper per day was being produced.

This was increased to 50 tons per week by 1851. By then the works supported a village of 100 people living in c. 30 houses with a post office, hotel, blacksmith, shoemaker and general store.  Apoinga seemed set for a rosy future.  The discovery of gold in Victoria dealt a staggering blow.  Almost every able man rushed to Victoria to make (as he thought) his fortune.  Production at Burra fell and the Burra Smelter closed down.  The reduced production was sufficient to keep Apoinga going.  Penny’s men wanted to leave, but they were under contract and he held them to it.  They dealt with this very effectively.  When the slag was drawn off they ensured a generous amount of good copper went with it.  Expenses thus remained high, but production of copper fell.  The works were forced to close and the men rushed to the gold fields.  Some years later when the works were re-opened for a short period a huge lump of solid copper was found at the bottom of the furnace and it took eighteen bullocks to drag it out.

Today sheep graze over the site and all that remains is the slag heap and a scattering of firebricks, still bearing the imprint of a long forgotten brick maker called Ramsay.  The ranges to the east and west are still heavily timbered.  The only remaining building in the village is the hotel, fairly sound considering its age.  Today it is empty.  A few more years will see the last remnants of the Apoinga post office’s mud walls dissolved away.  More permanent are twisted jagged lumps of slag to remind us of a remarkable, but shot-lived era of colonial enterprise.

More could be told of Mr Penny and his fear of escaped convicts and his petition for police protection and the challenge to his patent by the mighty Patent Smelting Co.
