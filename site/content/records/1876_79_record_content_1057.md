Burra Hotel Closes - Built c.30 years ago by Paxton with agreement of SAMA; the landlords have been Wren, Mason, Barker, Ware, Kent, Robinson, Lamb and White. Under Lamb it went into decline. About 1848 a large assembly room was added which was much used for social occasions and was where the town's Friendly Societies usually met.
