Obituary.  Mrs Robert Sharpe who died recently in the Burra Hospital was the only daughter of the late James and Elizabeth Honan and was born in Burra 24 June 1859 and when she was 12 months old her parents moved to Logan’s Gap on the Burra to Kapunda Road.  Her father was employed carting copper between Burra and Kapunda.  Later they lived at Caroona Station where her father was employed by Messrs Richards & Alfred Hallett.  Later still they came to Burra again and she was educated under the late Dr Stevens [i.e. Stephens] and his daughter Julia (later Lady Holder).  Some years later her father went back to work for Hallett Bros at Mt Bryan.  Here she met and married her first husband Mr Stephen King. And lived at Ruparra near Hallett where her husband was farming and grazing in partnership with J.G. Kelly.  The death of Mr King left her with six children and she returned to live with her parents.  In 1915 [actually in 1905] she married Mr Robert Sharpe who was born in London in 1854 and who survives her.

From the first marriage the family is: Mrs H.J. Dunn (Black Springs), Mr John King (Adelaide), Mr Stephen King (Mt Bryan), Mr Edward King (Tarlee), Mr Albert King (Hallett) and the late James King (Hallett).  There are 19 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.

[Born Sarah Ann Honan born 25 July 1859 Baldina: died 19 October 1931 Burra.]
