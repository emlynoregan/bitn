Burra Mine.  Ore Dressing Machinery.

Captain Sanders, the manager of the Mine has for some time devoted much attention to the economical separation of the ore from its attendant waste.    G.R. Lowe tells us that the Burra ores are acknowledged to be some of the most difficult to separate in the world.    Their respective gravities being nearly alike, they have been quite impossible to separate by mechanical means.  Captain Sanders has now devised a jigger that has been in operation for about six weeks with markedly successful results.  This follows a small model he trialled six months ago.  It is what is known in the field as a piston continuous jigger and once started and properly supplied with ‘stuff’ it is not necessary to stop it for adjustments.  Such jiggers are divided into two or more compartments to classify the ores as they leave the sieves.  Generally these divisions each have a piston, this appliance, however, has only one piston; which acts on the various compartment simultaneously.  The second and third compartments are fitted with an adjustable sheet iron slide between the piston and the sieve, and which regulates the action of the piston thereon.  The piston and sieve are each 11 ft long, the latter being 2 ft 9 inches wide.  The piston is worked from overhead, an adjustable crank being fixed at each end of a strong shaft, to which is fitted a heavy flywheel to ensure regularity of action.  The tail end of the jigger is fitted with a skimming box, into which the waste is deposited as it leaves the sieve.  This is capable of holding about a ton of stuff.  By having a skimming box attached in this manner it allows the sieve to be submerged to a considerable depth in the water, and in practice it is found that a very important point is gained; for by this mode much less fine ore is discharged with the waste, as the stream of water required to be constantly running over the length of the sieve has not such a disturbing influence on the fine ore as in the older methods of treatment.

[The description continues with considerably more details.]

The jigger has been erected to receive the stuff from ten head of stamps, and to replace one known as a Moonta jigger, which was found to be unsuited to the class of ores obtained at Burra, the fine stuff from the stamps completely choking it and making no separation of ores from the waste.  The new jigger will handle four tons of stuff per hour.  Captain Sanders has taken no steps to protect his invention, saying he would gladly see anything done to effect a saving in mining operations.  On going through the mine I was much impressed with a new and powerful crushing mill, which I am informed, puts through about 70 tons of stuff per day.  The ores from this are put through to the floors the same day, the waste going to the stamps and through the jigger as before mentioned, being thus made ready for the market; in fact the whole of the stuff raised in the mine during the day being treated, all the ore that it is possible to extract from it by mechanical means is taken out, and is ready for the market in the evening.
