Kooringa News, 25 February

Burra Burra Mine

Burra was astounded on Thursday 21 Feb. when all men employed at the Burra Mine, including officers, were given notice that their services would not be required at the end of the present take in seven weeks time.  Business people in the town could face endless embarrassments and thrifty and industrious men could foresee no means of obtaining employment before starvation overtook their families.

There are many unemployed already and many have recently come from Wallaroo through those mines being overcrowded.  On Sunday allusions to the calamity were made from all pulpits and the consolations of religion were urged upon all.  At present no orders have been received to stop work in the new shaft.  A hope is held that some tributers will be allowed to continue, but many feel this is an illusion as the mine has become too costly to pay for working at the present price of copper.  The first batch of men, numbering 56, was discharged last Saturday and more will be discharged each Saturday until all are gone.

On Monday many men sought to see Mr MacDermott SM who granted an immediate interview.  Spokesmen were J.M. Patterson of Copperhouse and Charles fellows of Kooringa.  They said that on Saturday 24 tutworkmen, 7 mechanics and 25 surfacemen had been discharged and all but two of them were married with large families.  Due to the high price of provisions in winter many had only just paid off debts incurred then.  Mr MacDermott promised to do what he could and would write to the Government to urge public works.  In fact he had written three weeks ago on that subject.  There was a regulation in the Destitute Board that relief was not to be granted to a family of an able bodied man.  He would, under present circumstances, disregard that regulation and would promise the men that their wives and children should not starve while they were away seeking work.

Mr Fellowes said many could not go.  They were without money due to such low wages lately.  He himself had only earned £45 at the mine in the past 12 months.

Mr MacDermott said the contract for the Dry Creek loop line had just been let and miners were a very suitable class of men for the contractors to employ.  Mr Patterson said that may be so, but how were men to get there without money.  Mr MacDermott said ‘Where there’s a will, there’s a way.’  Empty wagons left Burra regularly for Adelaide and the Smelting Company’s teams were always on the road and either of these means could be had for a small consideration.

Mr Patterson said he had just returned from a 300 mile journey to the north and east and had frequently to pay 1/6 for a meal.  No one could travel without money for food and lodging.  Mr MacDermott said he could not advise them to stay in Burra as ‘it was the worst place in the colony for them’.

The men thanked him for his kindness.  About 60 men were present.
