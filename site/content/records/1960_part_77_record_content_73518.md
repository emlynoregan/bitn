Community Teaching Comes to Burra.  Recently introduced electives have introduced the idea of community teaching on a small scale with parents coming into the school to teach and children going into the community (garages) to learn.  Mr Slater introduced the study of the local history of Burra and the children outlined visits and visitors for a five week period.  The children made the contacts and arranged tentative bookings by phone and followed up with a confirmation in writing.  Visits were followed up with verbal and later written tasks.

Program:

Animals, old people and food.  A talk at the school by Mr W. Broad.

Visit to ETSA.  Mr Martin gave a talk assisted by Mr C. Broad.

Visit to Cemetery.  Talk by Mr T. Perry.

Visit to Dugouts.   Mr [S] Woollacott gave a talk.

Visit to Brewery Cellars.  Mr Woollacott showed the group through.
