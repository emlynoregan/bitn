Burra Town Council, 19 December

The Inspector reported finding seven head of stray stock by keeping a man employed for 12 nights for several hours a night.

The Town Clerk has written up the old assessment with alterations, showing an increase of £298 due to new buildings.

The Public Works Committee recommended various road works etc. retarring of bridges, rebuilding the guard fence at the Bon Accord Bridge, which is rotten, and tarring the footpath from R. Fuss’s to the Kooringa Post Office.  Also work on Railway Terrace and purchase of a motor lorry.  These recommendations are to be considered next meeting.

Silent cops are to be painted white for 2ft around them to make them visible at night.

Cr Collins moved the Kooringa Methodist Church trustees be asked to rebuild the wall at the back of the church which is dangerously overhanging the footpath.  Seconded by Cr Allen.

Cr Harris said it had been like that for 20 years and was no danger.  He moved for no action and was seconded by Cr Pearce.  Carried.

The road which Mr Beckwith has asked to be opened will be opened.  Mr Blunt had said that he had bought his block on the understanding he had a 99 year lease on the road.  The Mayor said such a condition could not be correct.

Cr Pearce said the trees on the road were more of a nuisance than Mr Blunt’s fence.  Directly opposite the approach were at least 39 big gum trees in the centre of the road.  There were also 50 loads of rubbish.

[This discussion would seem to relate to the disposal  of land in St Just St where the surveyed road is much wider than would be needed for traffic and had come to contain what was effectively a piece of parkland: a situation that still exists, if not perhaps in exactly the same form as in 1927.]

Cr Woollacott said the gate on the creek previously promised was quite sufficient for the convenience of Mr Beckwith.  [Without further investigation this is not clear, but it may suggest access (perhaps to a road) in approximately the position of the modern walking/bicycle path.]

Various minor road and drainage matters were attended to along with weed destruction.

The road at the Bon Accord Bridge is to be inspected, as it has drainage problems and a dangerously abrupt shoulder.

Complaints have been made that the water supply in parts of the town, particularly in Paradise, is totally inadequate.  A bigger main is needed.  A letter is to be written to the Hydraulic Engineer’s Department.

Hanson Christmas Tree etc. was held at the local school on 17 December.

Burra Rifle Club.  The 13th stage of the Abberton Park Trophy and the Christmas Shoot were held.  For the Christmas shoot best results were from V.A. Riggs, H.G. Oates & C.W. Pearce.

For the 13th stage the best were V.A. Riggs, G. Herbert & H.G. Oates.
