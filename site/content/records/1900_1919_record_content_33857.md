Miss Sharrard [or Miss Sharrad, depending on the sentence in the report] was given a social in Leighton Hall.  She had been teacher at Leighton ‘for no long period’ and was leaving to get married.

[Strangely ‘she’ is also plural in some of the report, but there is no clear reference to the second (or indeed more) Miss Sharrard or Sharrad!]
