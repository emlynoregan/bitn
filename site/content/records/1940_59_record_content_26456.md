The Burra Benevolent Society benefited by £168 from the estate of the late Mrs Mary Thomas.  The Society has been going for 49 years.  [As for the Hospital bequest, I have not been quickly able to trace who this was.  There doesn’t seem to be any wife of Josiah Thomas who died about this time.  A Miss Mary Hannah Thomas died 3 November 1945 aged 78, so could the paper be confused?  Mrs Mary Thomas, widow of Josiah Thomas died in 1932 – did it take that long to finalise bequests?]
