Burra town Council representatives visited the Renmark Effluent Drainage Scheme and said they were impressed.  The co-operation given by the Public Health Department was excellent said Mayor E.T. Baulderstone.  Representatives of seven Councils attended the field day.  Problems caused by underground water and cracking soil had been solved using Ceramiflex flexible plastic jointed clay pipes.  The scheme would cost ratepayers about $20 p.a. for the average property.  An impressive aspect was the way in which soil was removed from the trenches, carted away and returned when filling was needed.  The streets were thus kept free from unsightly heaps of soil and dust problems were reduced.  The speed of laying the pipes at up to 1,000 feet per day was also impressive.
