Court Pride held their annual picnic at Princess Royal on Wednesday in perfect weather.  Two years ago there were twenty good on the books and now there are 92 with 30 added in the last month and there are proposals to bring the total to over 100.  Another ¾ column of detail is given as well.  There was a procession from the Institute at 9.30 a.m. via Market Square to Dr Sangster’s.  After three cheers for the ‘Court Surgeon’ the Doctor gave a brief address after which they marched back to market Square and boarded trollies, cabs etc. for the journey.
