Burra Burra DC, last Tuesday

A meeting of ratepayers has been called to consider the Councilâ€™s options in the face of large wage increases and rising overhead costs.  The question of lining the Burra Swimming Pool with fibreglass will have to be considered.  It removes the need for repainting every year and resists the growth of algae.

At the last meeting of Council on Tuesday Cr W. Brown was re-elected Chairman with Cr R.J. Jeffery as Deputy Chairman.
