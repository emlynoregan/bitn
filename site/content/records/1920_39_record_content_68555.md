Department of Mines Report for September 1937

Takati Mine.  The usual mining and prospecting continues.  A connection for ventilation purposes has been made with Baldina Mine.  A recent gold specimen ore patch yielded an estimated 250oz with the largest specimen 12½” x 8½” and 1” to 1½” thick, comprising gold with iron oxide, weighed 13½ lb and estimated to hold at least 100oz of gold.

Baldina Mine has yielded some quantity of specimen gold recently and had some good crushings.  It is proposed to equip the shaft with headgear and hoisting plant.

Wildildie Mine.  Two pairs of tributers are at work.  The ore vein is carrying a little gold.

Central Mine.  Prospecting continues.

Curlew Mine.  Good specimens from the north end.

Eastview Mine continues to produce crushing ore and some prospecting continues.

Byles’ Mongolata Mine.  Where gold was first discovered the main shaft has been continued and water level reached at 281ft.  This is the deepest working on the field and further sinking will enable the nature and value of the vein system to be determined.

Golden Harp Mine.  (Also owned by Byles’ Mongolata) A vein with some gold is being worked.

The Mongolata Goldfield has so far produced 7,433 oz of gold bullion, valued at £29,697 exclusive of premium.  The main contributors are:

Byles’ Mongolata	3,246oz 	£12,857

Takati	1,930oz	£7,717

Curlew	1,216oz	£4,932

Baldina Mongolata	932oz	£3,791

Eastview	428	£1,676

Wildildie	146	£577

The premium more than doubles the value and was received on all these amounts.
