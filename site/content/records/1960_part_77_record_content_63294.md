Obituary.  Mr ‘Joe’ Lloyd apparently suffered a heart attack at about 8 a.m. Saturday while driving west between the ‘Field’ and ‘Tiver’ properties in the Hundred of Hanson.  The car ran off the road, knocked down 72 ft of fencing and came to rest against some rocks after the motor stalled.  Mr Lloyd was discovered by a passing motorist.  Police and Dr L.G. Miller attended.  The car was hardly damaged.  [Page 3 adds that he was aged 66.]

[Joseph Lloyd born 23 September 1906 Hundred of Morgan: died 30 September 1972 near Burra, residence Burra.]
