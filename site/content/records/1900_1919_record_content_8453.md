A Bolt.  On Monday evening Master Keith Roach was thrown from a trap when the horse bolted.  The horse had tripped and fallen, breaking the shafts, before dashing off down Kingston St from Mr Joraslafskyâ€™s into Bridge Tce where the trap ran into a post and was smashed up.  Keith was only bruised.
