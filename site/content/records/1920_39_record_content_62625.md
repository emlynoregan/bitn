Burra Centenary Celebrations Committee met last Wednesday.

The School Committee reported matters well in hand and rehearsals under way.

The Floral Float is being made locally and is taking shape.  The design shows sea horses driven by a sea goddess and ridden by sea nymphs.  The float will take part in the Floral Pageant in Adelaide on 18 September, and will also appear in the Burra procession in Burraâ€™s celebrations.  The other float being made by Burra Pioneer residents in Adelaide will also be brought to Burra for the procession here.
