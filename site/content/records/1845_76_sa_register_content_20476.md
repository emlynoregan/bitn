Kooringa News, 8 May

The railway to Burra is the cause of much agitation again.  A preliminary meeting was held on Tuesday 3 May and a public meeting was arranged for the next week.  When it is considered there are many thousands of tons of ore lying useless at the Mine, which would pay handsomely if cartage were cheaper, all must admit the force of Burra’s claim for a railway.

Prospects at the Mine are very bleak, with men leaving the district daily.  Many of the best men are going to Victoria where wages are particularly good for skilled men.

The complimentary dinner at the Burra Hotel was a complete success.

Accident.  Am itinerant fiddler at the Burra Hotel was kicked in the chest and chin by a horse last week.  He fell back on the ground and his breathing became slower and slower until it stopped.  He was presumed dead when Dr Mayne came, but after the doctor had inflated his lungs, poured stimulants down his throat and applied artificial respiration, the man quickly recovered.

Princess Royal Mine is attracting great attention with 16 pitches let. The lessees Messrs Brenton & Farley expect to employ 100 more within a month.  It is said the reason for the mine’s earlier failure was the high rate of wages.  This will prove a great benefit to unemployed miners if the expectations of the proprietors are met.

Heinrich Sievert was charged today with stealing a hat, the property of Corporal Shaw, from the dining room of the Burra Hotel on 2 May.  He was committed for trial at the next Local Court of Full Jurisdiction.
