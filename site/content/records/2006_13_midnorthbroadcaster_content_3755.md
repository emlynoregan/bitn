Tony & Sandra Snook decided to sell the Mobil Roadhouse after five hard working years.  The handover to the new owners will be on 14 September.  The roadhouse is open from 7.30 a.m. to 9 p.m.  Prior to the roadhouse being there the site had a mixed history.  Prior to 1966 it was two separate blocks.

Block A was owned by James Waters 1875 to 1883.

Block B was owned by James Williams White 1877 to 1906.

The blocks were merged in 1966.  From 1966 to 1972 Lionel Hedgland Packer took ownership from Frank Ernest and from 1975 Raymond & Lola Jennison were owners till Tony and Sandra Snook bought the roadhouse from them.  Resident Mavis Spackman said some 60 years ago it was a fish and chip shop and before that a gramophone shop and when she was about 10 it became the fish and chip shop.

The new owners are Tony Gisi and Lisa Smedley.
