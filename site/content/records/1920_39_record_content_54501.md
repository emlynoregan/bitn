Burra High School.  The Intermediate results are very good.  Four of the five who sat gained certificates.

Joy Bentley	8 subjects (2 credits)

Clem Davey	7 subjects

Kathleen Drew	6 subjects

Jean Neil	5 subjects

Frank Pearce	6 subjects (1 credit), but failed to get a certificate because he failed English; almost certainly due to severe illness in the fortnight before the exams.

Laurie Walker passed English to complete a certificate.
