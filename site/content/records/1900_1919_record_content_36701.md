Mr J.T.F. Johnson head teacher of the Primary School said there were 248 on the roll, 215 had been examined and 187 promoted (92 boys and 95 girls).  For the first time this year the head teacher had promoted the students.  Previously they had been examined and promoted by the inspector.

Mr Johnson made special reference to the work of his assistant of 3 or 4 years, Miss Bullen, who had done great work with 70-100 children under her charge.

He made an appeal for more regular attendance, saying that children who came only 3 or 4 days a week were a drag on the progress of the whole school.

For the High School Mr Statton said they had begun with 30 students and dropped to 28 with an average attendance of 25.  As this was the first year of the school there were no public examination results to report, though 4 pupils had just sat for the Public Exhibition Exams and 1 for the Junior Public.  These results were not yet to hand.

The school had a library of c. 140 volumes, some lent by the students.

Sports were not neglected and two football matches had been played against Riverton, resulting in one win to each school.  A cricket club had been formed and the boys were very keen.  The girls had engaged in basketball in winter, but as novices had not played inter-school matches yet.

The Dux for 1913 was Harry Collins.

Mr McLaren for the School Board gave and address as did the Mayor Mr E.W. Crewes.

Mr Winnall explained the Instituteâ€™s donation of 14 free subscriptions to pupils and then Mrs McLaren presented the prizes.  The list of prize-winners is printed.
