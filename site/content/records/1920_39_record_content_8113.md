‘Ratepayer’ writes in reply to Mr Melrose denying that he is too mean to pay rates to aid the poor.  He suggests the donors should build a nice little [maternity] home rather than erect one in the back yard of the Burra Hospital at great expense to be supported by the ratepayers.  The writer goes on again to complain of the lack of consultation with ratepayers before such expense was incurred.

[The editor points out that the intended wing would be on the town side of the hospital facing the main road, rather than in the back yard and that the hospital and that the hospital tax for ‘Ratepayer’ would not exceed 15/- p.a.]
