The All-British League met at the Institute on Thursday evening with the Mayor presiding.

He said the League was not out to make enemies or say nasty things about anyone.

Mr J.H. Clouston, Mayor of Pt Adelaide and General President of the All-British League spoke of its aims:

Foster national ideals and keep alive patriotic spirit.

Defend British freedom, rights and privileges against German aggression.

Defend British industry and labour against German competition.

Fight German influence in social, financial, industrial, municipal and political life.

Guard against the ascendency of any language over English in state-aided schools.

Remember the Lusitania, the rape of Belgium, Nurse Cavell’s murder, etc.  He spoke of the League’s growth and against Germans in high places – naming Messrs Meucke & Basedow, who had been MPs, and of Mr Schomburg and of German language in schools and German language newspapers, which had continued till recently.  Mr Owen-Smyth also spoke on the history of German aggression since 1863, of German economic plans for domination and the need to buy nothing of German manufacture.  Rev. John Warren then spoke on the German goods issue and the need to drive all Germans from public office.  During the evening the Institute Orchestra played and the Messrs Ewins and Glenister sang a duet.  [Somewhat ironic given that Glenister was born Schneider.]
