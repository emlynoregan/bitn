Burra Burra Hospital Inc.  Annual Report

The Board of Management will have to rely on public support for the next 12 months even more than it has in the past year if standards are to be maintained.  Thanks are extended again to the sewing ladies and other donors for their continued support.  The Government has indicated a strict budget for the coming year.  Average bed costs have risen by $7.76 to $30.22.  During the year there were 386 patients admitted and 355 were discharged.  There were 703 out-patients and 101 operations were performed.  During the year a new boiler was installed and air-conditioning placed in the Nursesâ€™ Home and in the remaining private rooms.  New beds and a new deep freeze unit have been purchased.  We regret losing the services of Sister Oates, who took a position as Matron at Kimba Hospital.  Matron and the other nursing and domestic staff have done excellent work.  Meals on Wheels has continued to operate efficiently from the hospital.
