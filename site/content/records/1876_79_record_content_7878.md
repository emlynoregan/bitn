Burra Town Council has resolved to ask the government for £500 to assist in cutting down the bank near the Institute and widening and raising the road into Kooringa to make access to the town easier and suitable for more traffic.

Steps are to be taken to secure a recreation ground for the town. Mr Ullmann has offered gum trees to be planted when the site has been obtained.

The Mayor said his idea was they should request a special grant to cut down the bank and raise the road from the new church to the Commercial St Bridge.

Sir Henry Ayers had been asked about a recreation ground site and he asked that they put the request in writing.

The Commissioner of Public works has notified the Council that a gong would be placed at the Aberdeen railway crossing.

The police payment issue was discussed, but not resolved.
