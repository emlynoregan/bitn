W.H. Lloyd was re-elected as President.  The Society made a loss over the year of about £60, but the Government subsidy is yet to come in, which should see the account make it into the black.  About £70 was spent on improvements. New sheep yards and pavilion should be erected by the time of the next show.  The last show was opened by the Premier, Hon. T. Playford, on 14 October.  Attendance, estimated at 3,000 was very satisfactory.  There were 340 entries in the ring events.  Gate takings were up.  Sheep and wool did well, but it is intended to further encourage entries here with the new yards and pavilion.  Over 30 entries were made in the sheaf-tossing, which was a new event.  The pre-show ball was a success, but it could be more profitable if held a few weeks earlier, so the show’s Luncheon Pavilion could be used and a less elaborate supper would help in this regard.  Sideshows were more poorly represented because the date clashed with other shows.
