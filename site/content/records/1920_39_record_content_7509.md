Burra Football Assoc.  Thursday last.

Farrell’s Flat withdrew, considering that North Booborowie was too far to go to play.

Games with the Mid-North Assoc. were agreed to for 5 June at Saddleworth and 26 June at Burra.

Umpiring positions were settled.

Adoption of the Hills’ Assoc. rules was debated and they were ultimately adopted in part.
