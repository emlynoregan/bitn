Burra Primary School Welfare Club held its AGM 6 March.  Membership for the past year was 36 and average attendance 21.  The big project was the erection of the luncheon room at a cost of £1,200 and we look forward to furnishing it and putting it to use.  The school picnic was held at Gum Creek.

Mr Pattrick was farewelled in April and a very successful ball was held the same month.  The year ended with a Christmas Party for the children on break-up day.  The free milk scheme has started since school went back.  This was one of the things taken up by the club.  The boys from the Garden Club donated £50 towards furnishing the lunch room.  We have purchased a tea urn.

The treasurer reported income of £334, expenditure of £670 and a bank balance of £170.

Elected: President, Mrs E.T. Baulderstone; Vice-Presidents, Mesdames D.H. Field & A.D .Radford; Secretary, Mrs C. Phillips and Assistant Secretary, Mrs J.C. Morrison.
