New Traffic Laws

Motorists are now permitted to complete a right hand turn against a red light at intersections with traffic lights.

Vehicles at stop signs will have right of way over vehicles approaching from the left.  Once a driver has stopped at a sign ordinary right of way will prevail when he moves off.
