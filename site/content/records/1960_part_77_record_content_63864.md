Miss Gertrude Jordan writes from Ashfield, Sydney of her memories of the day her brother Arthur climbed the old Smelts Chimney and she enclosed a photo of her class at Burra School in 1897 or early 1898.  In a PS she adds: ‘I can remember when Mr Holder (Sir Frederick Holder) had a lot to do with the Record.’

[See Burra Record 57, 45, 10 Nov. 1936, page 3: Memories of Burra by Elizabeth A. Ward.  Arthur Jordan was at the time a schoolboy of 12 years of age, son of the late J.D. Jordan, watchmaker, of Kooringa.  Arthur Dawson Jordan born 8 March 1873 Kooringa: died 28 October 1965, Gawler.  See also 88, 5 (4), 9 Feb. 1965, page 6. Gertrude May Jordan 1882-1973.  Note if she was born in 1882 she was unlikely to have been at school as late as 1897 or 1898.]
