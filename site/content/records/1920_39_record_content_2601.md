Mayor’s Report 1920.  (S.M. Lane)

Six new residences have been erected in 1920 at a cost of £11,000 with two others under construction.

An ambulance has been acquired from the Dept. of Defence for £200.

During the year the town subscribed £26,000 to the second Peace Loan.  Its target had been £30,000, but considering previous efforts the sum raised was very successful.

In late 1919 it had been decided to build a new bridge in Ayers St using the Commonwealth gift of £240.  This had to be completed in 1920 and has cost the Council a considerable sum.  The new bridge removed a very nasty turn and makes Ayers St practically straight from Welsh Place.

The Council intends Market Square to be tar dressed as soon as the Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial is erected.

Over 100 trees have been planted in the park lands and a ticket office erected at Victoria Park and loam placed on the oval.

The cemetery is well kept.

At present there are seven electric street lights and the acetylene lamps are also operating more satisfactorily.

The grant for main roads (6½ miles) is £310 p.a., which is quite inadequate.  A fair proportion is tar dressed and this consumes £150-£170 p.a.  The main road to the station is not kept as it should be due to inadequate funds.

This summer the Government will redeck the Bon Accord Bridge in reinforced concrete at a cost of £700.  Mr J.A. McBride has given to the Council the Hampton Quarry, which supplies the town’s kerbstones

The town is in a good sanitary condition.

During the year the Council and town suffered a great loss in the death of Cr George Sampson.
