Burra Town Council.

In reply to a question of Cr McBride’s on notice, the Town Clerk said the cost of tar-paving roads was:

£69-18-1 for 21 chains [c. ¼ mile or 422 metres.]

£60-14-3

To metal a road cost £10-15-1 a chain [or £225-16-9 for 21 chains], which without tar lasted about 3 years.

Cr McBride said this cost only represented repairing and the original cost of tar was c. £8 per chain.  There were 6½ miles of main road in Burra and a grant of £400, which represented c. 15/- a chain, so it would not be possible to keep other roads in repair if £3 per chain went in tar dressing.

Someone needs to be sent to Adelaide to see how it is done properly.

Mr McBride and Mr Crewes than had an altercation over whether a Mr Brown had or had not told the Mayor that the Burra tarred roads were a credit to the town.  The Mayor said the road from Dalgety’s to the bridge was perfect for tarring and should be done.  Cr McBride disagreed.

The motion to tar the road was lost.

Monday.

Cr McBride said the present street lamps were very unsatisfactory.  Of the twenty, half were never lit.  There were ten days a month they were not lit at all, so effectively they were paying the lamplighter 9/- a day to light 20 lamps.

The Mayor said the present generators were unsatisfactory.  To go back to kerosene would be to go back 50 years and in any case lamp glasses had risen in price by 300% and the result would be even worse than the acetylene.

Cr Harris said he had been talking to the lamplighter and all but three lamps were going all right.

The Mayor said there were two or three lamps belonging to the old Band that might be used.  The Town Clerk reminded them that they were German and parts were hard to get.

Particulars of the most recent streetlamps are to be obtained.

Cr McWaters moved that the request of the lamplighter for more pay be refused.  Carried.

Captain Truscott of the Fire Brigade said that at present the reel was a fowl roost and was rusting and unless some arrangements were made he would refuse to take any further part in the brigade.

Council will inspect the situation.
