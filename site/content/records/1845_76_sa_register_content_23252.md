Three or four years have worked a marvellous change in the aspect of affairs at the mines. No great time has elapsed since they were appropriately described as a hive of human industry.  Clusters of workmen were engaged in the important duty of digging out the green ore.  Below ground were hundred of miners, one set succeeding the other in perpetual relay.  On the surface nearly as many were employed in the processes of raising, dressing and smelting.  The activity was reflected in the trade of the adjoining townships of Kooringa, Redruth, Aberdeen and half a score of smaller villages, all sharing the prosperity of the SA Mining Association.  The stoppage of the Burra workings was an ill day for them.  Businesses lost the bulk of their custom.  The streets lost much of their traffic.  ‘An appearance of antiquity and the reality of decay settled down upon the whole place.’
