Goyder Council CEO Steve Kerrigan writes in response to recent letters published from Mr Douglas Wiltshire, which make serious allegations against the Council:

So far Council has avoided responding to these matters in the belief they should be resolved through the channels established under legislation, but the latest notice published on 13 November has forced this response to totally reject his inferences against the integrity and performance of my staff.

Mr Wiltshire has referred over 30 issues to both the Ombudsman and the Minister of Local Government over a two month period, involving significant staff time on almost a daily basis.  Council recognises its duty to respond to reasonable requests for information and clarification of issues placed before Council.  However, the number of requests and responses required is becoming unmanageable and is in danger of infringing on the ability to provide those services to the community required by the Local Government Act.  Most issues raised are either within the discretion of Council or are matters the Council considers to be entirely without foundation and which will be defended in court by Council if necessary.  Anyone interested in changing the Councilâ€™s direction should consider discussing issues with current elected members.
