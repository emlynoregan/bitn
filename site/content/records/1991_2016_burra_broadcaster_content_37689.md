Letter from Valerie Rivers – posing three questions about the Market Square redevelopment:

Who makes the decisions coming from the Council Chambers, elected members or paid employees?

Why can’t decisions that have been made be changed when enough qualified objections are raised?

How can restrictions of traffic flow and the lessening of the ease of parking increase commercial activity in Market Square?
