Redruth Girls Reformatory is to be closed.  Official advice was given to the Matron on Friday.  The Salvation Army will take over the work at Enfield.  We believe there should be an investigation into the affairs of the State Children’s Council.  Its President, Mr Huntley, has spoken of the difficulties of appointing staff and a Matron and said that a Matron frequently had to be appointed without experience – there have been only three Matrons in 20 odd years and Miss Bubb was previously Matron of Parramatta Industrial School.
