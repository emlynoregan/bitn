Booborowie Memorial Institute Opening.

The hall is a spacious 80ft x 37ft x 24ft with a hoop pine floor and there are 16 high windows.  There is also a 20ft x 40ft supper room and it is lit by petrol gas.  The hall is of stone construction.  The architect was Mr H.E. Fuller of Adelaide and it was built by Messrs Lampe Bros. of Spalding.  The Chairman of the committee Mr W.J. Ashton introduced Mrs I.J. Warnes who opened the hall with a golden key made by Mr Spencer, jeweller of Burra.  Mrs Warnes then made a speech.  (Mr Warnes was in Melbourne.)  Mr Ashton said a hall had been suggested at a meeting on 14 March 1914, but the war had intervened and the matter dropped.  When peace came it was decided to build a main hall and then later two rooms at the front.  P.J. Redden was secretary till he left the district and then Mr Cousins took over.

Dr Steele then spoke as President of the Burra Sub-Branch of the RSL.  Mr Crewes, Mayor of Burra, also made a few remarks praising the spaciousness of the hall.

In the afternoon Booborowie defeated Burra in a football match.  [Scores not given.]

A great crowd attended the evening concert, which was followed by a supper and dance.

The Incidental Fund Committee provided afternoon tea and supper.  Over the two days of opening celebrations on 21 September and 12 October over Â£400 was raised.
