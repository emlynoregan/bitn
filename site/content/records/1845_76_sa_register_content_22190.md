Redruth News, 8 July

Samuel Bailes is believed to have pillaged a number of huts on his flight from the Clare District to the North-Eastern Plains.  On 8 July he was charged with stealing from the hut of James Rosser, a shepherd on Paratoo Run, one canteen valued at 4/-.  On 2 July Patrick O’Neill Police-trooper and Trooper Catchlove arrested Bailes at Annattra on several charges of horse stealing and hut robbing.  Rosser’s name was on the canteen with the prisoner and it was recognised by Rossiter along with a chain and strap.  Bailes was committed for trial in Adelaide and was taken by the troopers to Clare, where other charges were to be preferred against him.

William Walsh alias Walter beadle was brought up on remand, charged with altering a cheque at Kooringa on 30 June, drawn by R. &. P. Couch, from £4-14-3 to £64-14-3.

Mr S. Drew of Samuel Drew & Co. said the prisoner had purchased c. £5 worth of drapery goods on 30 May and tendered the cheque in question as payment.  As the amount was large and the man unknown only about £16 in cash and goods was given for it, with the balance to be paid on Monday morning, when the prisoner promised to call for it.  He did not.

The bank returned the cheque unpaid and he notified the police.  Corporal Shaw found the prisoner on the other side of the Murray, en route to Victoria, still in possession of the goods bought from Mr Drew, who identified them.

Richard Couch said he has paid the cheque to a man named James Linch on 18 May for lamb minding – it was drawn for £4-14-3.  James Williams gave evidence that he saw Linch and the defendant in the Pig & Whistle and saw Linch give the prisoner a cheque and saw the prisoner write something on it.  He also heard the prisoner say he would go with the cheque to Drew’s and later saw him coming from Drew’s with a bundle.  The prisoner was committed for trial in the Supreme Court.
