Burra Coppertown Festival

There was a marked lack of support for another festival at the meeting held on 26 March.  If there is no indication of better support at the meeting to be held on 9 April in the Civic Centre at 8 p.m. the committee will have no option but to conclude that the community neither needs nor wants a Bicentennial Festival in 1988.
