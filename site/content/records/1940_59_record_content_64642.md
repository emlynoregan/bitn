Burra Town Council, 2 August

After inspection it was decided to lay concrete slabs over the water table in front of H.J.B. Jennison’s petrol pumps.

E.D. Reed applied to purchase a portion of streets in Section 2071, Hundred of Kooringa, on the south side of allotments 40 & 31, known as Victoria St [Hampton.]

The ranger is to be asked to pay more attention to straying stock.

A dozen flowering gums will be planted near the basketball courts.  Kurrajongs will be planted on the west side of Paxton Terrace, opposite Mr Lott’s.

Flowering gums are to be planted near the residences of P.V. Oates and H.J.B. Jennison.
