New Burra Hospital Services

Burra Hospital has begun a program to give local residents access to services for which they had previously to travel.  Country Health SA and Lower North Health services director Gary Stewart said the trial program for people with cardiac or respiratory problems has been successful and will continue.  The program focuses on physical activity to assist with rehabilitation.  Previously this had involved travel to Clare or Adelaide.  Funding had been by CHSA, but now Burra has access to Multi-Purpose Service funding.  This decision will involve a reduction of one bed in hospital capacity, but this could be reactivated if required.  There is also the opportunity to upgrade the accommodation for some of the nursing home patients, to give better access to bathrooms and toilet facilities.  These improvements will not compromise the number of beds available and are a great outcome.  Darryl Venning, who is a member of the Local Health Advisory Council, has convened the first of a series of local meetings to discuss the present and future health service needs of the Burra Community.  He said many people did not realise Burra Hospital has access to many allied health services, such as mental health, podiatry, occupational therapy and physiotherapy.  Speech therapists and opticians come to Burra and work out of the hospital, so it is important that we use what services we have so they can be retained.
