Gary and Gail Edwards at Aberdeen Roadhouse have the SA Farmers Fuel logo on their petrol pumps.  Gary said the pricing policies of the major companies do not allow them to offer country customers what outlets in the city can offer.  SAFF delivers to rural community stores, service stations and roadhouses in conjunction with the on farm deliveries and they have a policy of not being undersold.  He says it seems Burra fuel prices have dropped since it was known a SAFF outlet was coming.  [Photo of Gary & Gail with price sign ‘Unleaded 91.9’]
