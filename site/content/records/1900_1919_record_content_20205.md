Joseph Tobin has returned to Burra with his brother Thomas, after the death of their brother Michael.  Michael was speared by an Aborigine at Wadda Walla in WA on 6 April.  The deceased was in a party opening up a stock route from the gold fields to the far north, led by A.W. Canning.  He was speared twice, killing the native with a shot as the second spear was launched.  He was conscious for 17 hours after the attack, but knew he was dying.  His name is perpetuated in Tobin Lake.  The fatality was some 500 miles from Wiluna and news did not get out until 5 July.  [Tobin Lake is a significant one that crosses the Canning Stock Route at approximately the latitude of Onslow on the coast of WA.]
