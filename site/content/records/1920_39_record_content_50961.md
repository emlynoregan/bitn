C.J. Pearce was tendered a surprise evening last Saturday by the Adelaide Officers of the Albert District No. 83 Rechabite Lodge, marking the 58th year of his services as local Secretary of the Rose of Sharon Tent.  Mr Pearce who is 78 still holds the office and looks fit for some years yet.  Arrangements were made by William Geake & Edwin Harris, two old members of the lodge.  The cost was borne by the District Executive Committee and all senior members of the male and female Rechabite Lodges, the honoured guest and his wife and family were guests of the committee.

Other visitors came from Hallett, Mt Bryan, Leighton, Ironmine and Hanson, while Mr E.J. Davey represented the Foresters Lodge and C.R. Bevan the Oddfellows.

Bro J.V. Earle (Pt Adelaide) presided.  The evening began with the singing of the ode and then Mr Pearceâ€™s granddaughter Miss Nancy Pearce played a piano solo.  Bro Earle introduced the evening and said Bro Pearce had also been Secretary of the Juvenile Tent for 53 years and Secretary of the Female Lodge for 43 years.  He was supported by Bro Lewis (Pt Adelaide) and Bro S.J. Goldsworthy.  Misses Beth Haese & Nancy Pearce then played a piano duet followed by a speech from Bro Blight.  Mrs Max Pearce then sang a song and Bro Bowey (Enfield) spoke.  Messrs Bevan and Davey added their congratulations followed by Rev. G.C. Hutchinson and C.E. Thomas.  Maude Riggs then gave a recitation and the Chairman presented Mr Pearce with a handsomely framed emblem and Mr Pearce responded.  He said that when he took over as Secretary 58 years ago the Lodge met in the Baptist Church, now the Council Depot.  Later they moved to the Institute where they still met.  His predecessors as local Secretary had been the late David wells, then Mr Shapley, David Anderson and then himself.  He mentioned the long and happy relationship of the Lodge with the various medical officers resident in Burra: Drs Dashwood, Cave, Nesbit, Brummitt, Sangster Sen. & Jnr, Ashton, Caw, and now Steele & Steven.  Bro Bowey followed with a comic recitation and Bro Earle with a comic dialogue.  Supper followed.

On Sunday morning a Lodge Parade was held at Kooringa Methodist Church when quite a number of members attended in full regalia.  The service was conducted by Bro J. Earle assisted by Bro Lewis and Bro Bowey delivered the address.
