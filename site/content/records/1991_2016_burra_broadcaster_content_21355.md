The Mid North tourist Assoc. at a meeting in Burra last Thursday debated the need for a change of name for the region.  Tourism SA proposed a change from Classic Country to Clare Country.  Tourism operators were unhappy with this.  A motion was passed to advise the Minister for Tourism that it should be called Clare Valley/Mid North.  Recently eight regions were reduced to four [for funding purposes] and this forced the Mid North to be joined with Yorke Peninsula.  Classic Country was recently asked to disband as soon as possible by Tourism SA and the MNTA has agreed to this from 30 June 2000 to enable present marketing commitments to be completed.  Tourism SA apologised for not sending a representative to the meeting, which consequently was unable to get clarification on some points raised.
