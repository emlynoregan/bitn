BCS was opened by the Minister of Education Dr Don Hopgood last Friday.

Mr Ian Allen on behalf of the School Council, Parents & Friends’ association, staff and students, welcomed the visitors and introduced the Principal Mr Chris McCabe.  He said that as most people knew, the Minister of Education had accepted the offer of $20,000 from the community to extend the size of the gymnasium.  He called on Mr Ray Jennison to hand over the Council’s contribution of $10,000.  Mr Jennison said the very welcome decision of the Government to build the new school ended a 30 year battle featuring small periods of optimism and large periods of pessimism.  He said the thought at first of a 20 acre site outside the town was horrifying.  The new school surpassed their wildest dreams and as a Council they were proud of the Community Library.  Burra was placed in the vanguard of new developments and concept and we thank all who had faith in Burra and worked to achieve this magnificent result.  We thank the Government and the Public Buildings Department for giving the Burra Burra DC the earthworks contract, which enabled the Council to hold onto their workforce – it was in effect a grant of $130,000 to the Council.  The decision to have a full-sized gymnasium when the opportunity was offered was an easy one.  Mr Jennison then handed over the cheque, saying: ‘If the Hon. Minister accedes to all our requests for the next twelve months, we’ll probably sign it.’

Mr McCabe then introduced Mr Ron Thamm to hand over the School Council’s $10,000 cheque.  Mr Thamm said it was fitting that Burra should start the second century of education with a facility of this magnitude and grandeur.  He said this is to me a day of thanksgiving and a day to recall the many organisations and people who have played a role and have contributed to the project.

[He went on to mention Mr Birdsie, the architect, the present Government, Mr Claude Allen, Dr Hopgood, the Education Department, past and present District Councils, School Councils and committees and the Public Buildings Department.]  He then handed over the $10,000 cheque.

Mr McCabe called on Dr Hopgood to officially open the school.  Dr Hopgood drew attention to the vast number of people and organisations that have come together to make such a project possible and to make it a success.  Apart from building a school for the children, the Education Department wanted the people of Burra and the surrounding district to share and be part of the new school.  A key feature was the recreation facilities and another was the Community Library.  The Department of Further Education had also made a valuable contribution.  He hoped the co-operation evident to date would long continue.  [He then went on to develop the idea of whole community involvement in education with wide ranging use of school facilities every day of the week and throughout the year.]

He was sure a problem solving and child centred approach was the way forward.  He said budget constraints would prevent this type of facility from being put everywhere in SA, but future building programs would certainly aim to be as flexible as possible so they could accommodate where possible community purposes.  He said community education required some definite guidelines:

An openness of attitude and ease of access for people of all ages.

The community needs to be actively engaged in the education process.

A loose relationship with other services is essential.  Too often schools have been seen as the only resource for the community.

It must be realised that Community Education allows for extensive involvement and community participation in the school and for school participation in the community.  Schools can make their resources available to the community and the community can reciprocate.

In some schools like Burra’s this sharing can become quite complex with special management groups and committees to co-ordinate participation.  He ended by praising the Public Buildings Department, which had completed the project sixteen weeks ahead of schedule and saved on the budgeted cost.  He declared the school open and granted a half-holiday.

Mr McCabe called on Mr Graham Gunn, Member for Eyre, to propose the vote of thanks.  Dennis Thamm and Roxanne Hall, representing the students, presented a collection of Burra booklets to Dr Hopgood.
