Johnny Green.  For perhaps eighty years the figure of a miner stood on the poppet heads at the mine until they were burnt down and his limbs fractured.  On Monday Cr March said the figure is at the Council Depot and he urged the repair and re-erection of the figure, perhaps near the Mine Bridge.  The Mayor said such had been suggested some years ago.  The structure would have to be substantial.  The overseer said some iron bars were available that would place the figure at 25ft.  The figure had been reconstructed and only needed a bolt or two to make it right.  Cr Jennison said some form of inscription was needed.  Cr Bevan suggested that Mr Treloar might provide that if approached.
