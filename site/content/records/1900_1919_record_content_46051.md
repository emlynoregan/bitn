On 16 December Dr Ashton wrote that the Matron had told him it was impossible with the present staff to give the special attention he needed for certain enteric fever patients during a recent severe outbreak.  He asked for steps to remedy this deficiency.

The secretary asked for clarification of the closing statement, which referred to the consequences of this problem in Reice’s and similar cases.

An Acknowledgement has been received signed jointly by Drs Ashton & Williams:

‘Your notes of the 11th inst. have been received.’

The Board was indignant at what seems to have been a decision not to answer their request at all and were also annoyed and puzzled by Dr Williams’ signature, as the case referred to occurred before he was in town.

Mr Gebhardt wanted individual replies.

Mr Crewes thought the Doctors should be asked to a conference with the Board and Mr Warnes so moved.

Mr Hawkes said the letter was not only rude, but also intentionally rude and a conference would achieve more than letters, which could easily lead to unpleasant developments.  Motion carried unanimously.

The Board agreed to meet with the Local Board of Health on the issue of responsibility for the payment for infectious diseases cases referred by them to the Hospital.  Mt Bryan Local Board of health wrote accepting responsibility.  Hallett agreed to pay without accepting any responsibility to do so.  Their attention is to be drawn to the Act.

Mr Hawkes said something had to be done about the Isolation Ward.  It was an abomination and a veritable death trap: like a camp oven in summer and an ice-chest in winter.  It was an iron structure.

Mr Warnes moved the Government be written to pointing out to them that the Board felt it endangered the life of any patient placed in it.

Other urgent work was cellar accommodation, ward wash-up house and a ramp to the new buildings from the operating theatre and the removal of some of the old buildings.  Request that they be allowed to get the work done locally, but at Government expense.
