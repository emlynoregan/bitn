Health Report

Dr Steele: Very little infectious disease this year.  As usual in late summer and early autumn there were some cases of typhoid fever – this year not many – 10 in all.  Though some were serious, no one died this year from typhoid.  It is a pity that septic tanks are not cheap enough to be made compulsory.  Attention to disinfection of pits is important and cans and pits should be fly proof.
