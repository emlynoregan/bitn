Deputation on Morgan-Burra Road

Representatives of the Burra, Spalding, Robertstown and Morgan District Councils met with the Minister of Roads, Hon. G. Virgo, introduced by E.C. Allen MP on Wednesday.  They were concerned to see the Burra-Morgan Road sealed to encourage tourism, especially in view of the relocation of the Morgan Dock Yard.  They received a cordial reception and a sympathetic hearing and an investigation was promised.
