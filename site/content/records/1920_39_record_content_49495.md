Burra Amateur Swimming Carnival, 10 February

The event was somewhat marred by the weather and by the failure, for no explained reason, to start on time at 2.30 p.m.  The carnival actually started at 3 p.m.  Intermittent light rain spoilt the afternoon, despite which attendance was good.  The arrangements made by the secretary were excellent and visitors unfamiliar with the pool were astonished to find such a nice sheet of water in such unusually rugged and beautiful surroundings.  Many improvements had been made with racing strings and lines of bobbing corks.  [Principal organisers are listed.]  Entries were good in both swimming and diving.  A splendid exhibition of diving was given from the cliffs by L. Winkley, R. Thorpe, D. Halliday and J.M. Tiddy.
