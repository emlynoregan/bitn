St John’s Ambulance, Burra

Ron Thamm will be presented with a long service award for work with the St John’s Ambulance Brigade at a ceremony and parade in Adelaide in October.  People are eligible after twelve years and Mt Thamm has been associated with the Burra Branch since its commencement in 1960.

The Base Radio for the St John’s Ambulance will be housed at Burra Hospital.

Negotiations with the District Council will see the EFS sharing the transmitter equipment to be erected on Nankivell’s Hill.
