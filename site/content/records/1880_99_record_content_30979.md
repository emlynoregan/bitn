Vandalism.  Early Monday morning two men were discovered breaking down the trees in the reserve at the end of the Kingston St Bridge for Christmas tree use.  They were not residents, but had undertaken to get greenery for decoration.  As they had no money they were given 21 days.  By law they were liable for a fine of up to £5 or three months and to pay damages, which were estimated at £2.  Five trees were destroyed.
