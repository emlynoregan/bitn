Pigmy Bluetongues

The year 1959 saw the lizards spread as far as Marion and now this critically endangered species has been found at only 22 sites in native grasslands with a population estimated at anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000.  The recovery team was founded in 1993 when Pigmy Bluetongues were first rediscovered near Burra.  The team lapsed due to lack of funding, but was restarted in 2004.  Threatened Fauna Ecologist Julie Schofield said the lizards had some fascinating features:

They eat insects

They are very territorial

Females are longer that males and can carry two babies at a time

The mother cares for the young for some time – unusual for lizards

The recovery team is monitoring several populations to learn more and is attempting to get a certain number of populations under a heritage-conservation agreement, which involves liaising with landowners and making them aware of the lizard’s requirements.  BCS has a population on its property.  Mapping populations is another aim.  Their fragmented population makes them critically endangered.
