Accident.  On Friday Mr J. Davey, employed by Drew & Crewes of Kooringa, was pouring bisulphide of carbon into a pint bottle when it ignited.  Some spilled onto his trousers and burnt holes there as well as on his socks and shoes.  Water soon extinguished the flames on Mr Davey, but great care had to be taken to prevent the spread of the fire to the shop.  Mr Davey was only slightly burnt himself.  The cause of the fire is unknown.
