The meeting on 21 July decided to have a railcar from Adelaide for the show, and to cut out the train from Terowie, but get a quote instead on a railcar.  The rest of the report deals with the prize list for the annual show and other arrangements for that as well as a report from the Northern Shows Association.  Burra was allocated the date 22 October.
