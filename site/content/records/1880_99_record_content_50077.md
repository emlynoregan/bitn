Obituary.  Mr John Roberts, a very old Burra resident died last Saturday.  He came to Burra in 1850 and carried on a grocery business for several years.  He moved to Robertstown about 26 years ago and set up a store there.  That town is named after him.  He died from mortification setting in following cutting his toenails.  The funeral was largely attended in the Kooringa Wesleyan Church with Rev. R.S. Casely officiating.  [Died 20 May 1893 aged 76.]
