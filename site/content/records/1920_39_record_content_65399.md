Tom Canny writes condemning the Mayor’s remarks on the departure of Sgt Kain as being in poor taste.  He and the Council decided that ‘highly paid citizens should not be farewelled’.  This is an attitude not borne out in the light of previous occasions.  [Some details in this letter are corrected in the next issue.]
