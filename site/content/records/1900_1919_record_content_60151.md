After a little fencing Mr Crewes said it was Mr Winnall.

The latter said it was common practice to sound out potential members and he had done so before the letter from the Chief Secretary had been written and had not tried to persuade anyone.

Mr Crewes then withdrew his remark in connection with the letter, since Mr Winnall assured the meeting he did not know about it, but not his remarks about interviewing residents.
