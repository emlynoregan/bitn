Obituary.  Mr John Drew died at his residence, Mt Pleasant, Kooringa, on 15 August.  He is a descendant of families that arrived here in the 1840s.  He had been ill for some weeks from heart and lung problems.  He was born in Kooringa on 7 September 1868, the eldest son of the late Mr & Mrs Thomas Drew and educated first at Mr White’s School and then at Prince Alfred’s College until he was 17, after which he went to Pt Pirie to work for Messrs Prest Bros., of which an uncle, Mr W. Bosomworth, was a partner.  When Messrs John, Charles & Thomas Drew, trading as Samuel Drew & Co., retired, Mr John Drew jun. came from Pt Pirie in August 1889 and with the late E.W. Crewes took over the business as Drew & Co.  This became Drew & Crewes and after some years, Drew & Crewes Pty Ltd.  As a young man he was much involved with football and cricket and is said, when playing a Country v. City match to have hit a ball over the pickets and into the River Torrens.  He was an old member of the Rifle Club and played bowls.  He was a member of Burra Light Horse under Major Watt.  He was also a long serving member of the Burra Institute Committee and President more than once.  He was a member of the Town Council and Mayor*, during whose term the avenue of pines leading to the cemetery was planted.  He was also a long serving member of Kooringa Methodist Church in which he held all offices in turn and was a member and secretary of the Trust till his death.  He was for 40 years Superintendent of the Sunday school.  On 29 September 1892 he married Miss Catherine E. Goode, 2nd daughter of the late Mr & Mrs B.P. Goode of Pt Pirie.  Three of four children survive: Ken M. Drew (Burra), Doris Mrs R. Scott (Barmera), & Mr John T.P. Drew (Leighton).  His second son, Alan Drew, died as a result of a car accident last year.  There are eight grandchildren.
