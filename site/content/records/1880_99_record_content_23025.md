A New Local Government Bill was introduced which would have divided the settled areas into 42 relatively large shires, while leaving the Incorporated Towns outside of them.  Shire 26 would have been made from the merging of the Districts of Apoinga, Burra, Hallett, Mt Bryan, Baldina (comprising the Hundreds of Baldina, Bright, Bundey & King), and Mongolata (comprising the Hundreds of Mongolata, Rees, Tomkinson & that part of the Hundred of Hallett then outside of the District Council of Hallett).  The various District Councils then in existence would have become something like wards in the new shires.  The shires would control all main and district roads, be Boards of Health, Drainage Boards, and have the power to initiate gas and waterworks, to create industrial areas and exercise rabbit control.  [Needless to say such a wide, sweeping reform was beyond the power of an unstable Government with a hostile upper house.]
