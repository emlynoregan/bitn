Mrs Annie Seal (Kooringa Hotel).  The Inspector reported it was properly furnished and clean with a billiard room, but no sample room.  There was an acetylene gas plant, but currently used kerosene lamps.  There was stabling for 11 horses and the sanitary arrangements were pits.  The police supported the application as did several witnesses.
