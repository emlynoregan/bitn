Flinders University has selected Burra as a prime site for archaeological and cultural tourism research.  The project was initiated by Burra Branch of the National Trust and is also supported by the Regional Council of Goyder and the Mid North Regional Development Board.  Mr Peter Birt, a graduate researcher, has been given a scholarship for this work and will be based in Burra.  Dr Claire Smith of Flinders University will supervise.  Initially archaeology will concentrate on the dugouts of Mitchell Flat and will involve both graduate and undergraduate students.  Burra has been identified as the most significant colonial town we have and a perfect town to study multiculturalism in Australia.  Research on marketing tourism will also be undertaken.
