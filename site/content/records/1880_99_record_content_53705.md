‘Whip’ Sporting Notes

The Burra Homing Club race from Manoora last Wednesday was won by E. Lewis’s bird, but the result is marred by the failure of the timekeeper to notice the arrival of E.W. Crewes’s Prosperity, which quite likely got in first and was only later found in the loft by its owner.

Today’s intended race from Riverton has fallen through because several birds sent to Riverton for a training race last Wednesday have not returned.

Since writing this the wing of Mr Crewes’s Prosperity has been found between Saddleworth and Manoora, attacked by a hawk.
