Town Council

Cr Drew has moved the sale of the £100 bond, held by the cemetery, and the money go to the South Ward, together with any surplus from the slaughterhouse, for improvements to roads.  Cr Ridgway doubted the Council’s authority to do this and so information on that will be sought.

We regret that the Council has decided not to go ahead with the Thames St Bridge.

Market Square Well has reached 200’.
