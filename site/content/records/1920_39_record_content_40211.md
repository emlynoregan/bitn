Weather.  Thunderstorms have dropped patchy but useful rain on the eastern country.  71 points fell at Braemar with 98 at H. Dearlove’s and 1½” at Ketchowla.  Some places however, were below 50 points.  At ‘The Gums’ one end of the station got 86 points while the homestead recorded only 30.  Canowie recorded 316 points in four days in December.  Spalding was delighted with 3” in 70 minutes on Thursday, but Burra has received nothing.
