Porter’s Lagoon Aquatic Sports – Porter’s Lagoon Boat Club

The third annual event was held on 30 January.  The day was rather too hot, but that did not deter visitors.  From early morning till 2 p.m. cars arrived in a steady stream and by then there were about 600 parked on the north side of the lake and over 3,000 people.  Four years ago it was a useless strip of water, but for some time now it has acted like a magnet.  Much is due to Mr Harold Atkins, President of the Club, who has spent both time and money in promoting the Club and its activities.  He is of course aided by good helpers and a powerful committee.  For such a large crowd there were deficiencies: notably a lack of adequate changing facilities, seats and toilets.  No one anticipated attendance would double last year’s.  Miss Pratt and her army of assistants coped with the luncheon and refreshments etc. and the couple of sideshows did good trade.  Even the copper attendant handing out hot water collected £13.  The Point Pass Band of 18 players enlivened proceedings.

The water is described as 2 miles by 1 mile ‘with ample and varying depths’.

The failure of the advertised hydroplane to appear was a disappointment.  The craft, called the Missossi, was damaged the day before and held at Eudunda for repairs.

A.W. Sampson, State Amateur Diving Champion, gave an exhibition, as did H. Taylor, Australian Amateur Swimming Champion.  The former dived from boards at 7’6” and 15’.

Captain P. Head’s dinghy overturned and caused some concern briefly.

The aquatic events are then described in detail.  The local swim for Mr F. Spencer’s trophy was won by Mr Rollo Hawkes.

The northern side of the lagoon has now been fenced and trees planted, diving boards and a small jetty have been erected and a large swing, two change houses and luncheon sheds.

Gate receipts were £137-15-9.  (Gross takings being c. £150.)  Clear profit from this and other sources is expected to be about £100.

Perhaps some shore events and more sideshows and hurdy-gurdies etc. would be a welcome addition.  There are moves to form an amateur swimming club.

[The report in detail extends for about 2½ columns.]
