Copper Mines.  [The article begins with references to copper discoveries in the far north of SA.]

While speaking of copper mines we may refer to that of Captain Walter Hughes on Yorke’s Peninsula within about four miles of Port Riley.  It has been rather quarried than properly worked.  The first shipment was made by the schooner Daphne, which brought 50 tons to Port Adelaide this week, but there are nearly 1,000 tons at grass.  It is said three times that amount could be raised in a short time.  The ore is supposed to be 26-28% copper and contains sufficient iron to work as a flux with the ore of the Burra Burra Mine.  We understand arrangements are likely with the Patent Copper Co. [i.e. the English & Australian Copper Co.] who have sometimes used Karkulto ore for the same purpose.  The location of the new mine is most favourable, with ore capable of being carted to the seaboard for 8/- per ton compared with the Burra to Port Adelaide cost of 50/- to £3 per ton.
