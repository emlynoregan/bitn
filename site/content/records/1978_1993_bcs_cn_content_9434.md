Doreen Baulderstone Memorial Fountain

Mrs Baulderstone was the last Burra Mayoress, having served in that capacity for some 15 years.  She was a tireless worker for the community, also serving with Meals on Wheels, Uniting Church Fellowship Guild, the CWA, Red Cross, Adelaide Children’s Hospital Auxiliary, Burra School Welfare Club and the M & BHA 9for which she had Life Membership).  She also did much work for the Lewis Trust.

A group of ladies met last Tuesday at Mrs Lola Jennison’s and decided to build a fountain to her memory in the quadrangle of the Burra Hospital.  This area is currently undergoing redevelopment as a pleasant all-weather recreation area and garden and a fountain would be an elegant addition.  To raise funds a giant trading table is planned for 22 June.
