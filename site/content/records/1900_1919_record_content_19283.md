Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co.  Mr W.A. Horn has put down £10,000 deposit and secured a three-month option over the mine.  This is a much more businesslike deposit than the £250 put down the other day.  If satisfactory arrangements can be made it is believed Mr Horn will begin to gat things going even before the three months are up.  It did not take him long to float the Great Cobar Mine.  The remaining tributers are not doing so well and on Saturday three left to ‘crack stones’ for the Corporation.
