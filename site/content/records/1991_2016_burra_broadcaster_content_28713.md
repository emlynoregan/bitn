The Visitor Centre Working Party has recommended offering a lease of the Visitor Centre to BRTBA from 1 January 2003, with the Council making an annual contribution of $35,000 towards the running of the centre.  The Council has agreed with an amendment that the Council’s contribution be reduced by $2,500 p.a. after the first year, to reach $25,000 in 2007.  The Association has expressed its ‘in principle’ support and was willing to have representatives on a board of management, together with those of Goyder Council and the National Trust, who have vital interests as owners of the Burra Passport Key Tour, but it wants a review after 12 months and the roles of all parties to be negotiated.  It asked for any losses to be under-written by the Council, which was not a working party recommendation.  The working party expected the Centre to have an income of $30,000 from 30% of the Passport sales and $35,000 from Council and $5,000 generated from BRTBA membership.
