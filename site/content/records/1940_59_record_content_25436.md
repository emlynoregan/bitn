Burra Golf Club

Every Effort is being made to revive the Golf Club.  A meeting was held in the Lodge Room at the Town Hall last Wednesday.  Dr Steele convened the meeting.  He said the club had gone into recess in 1942.  Mr Pontifex as acting secretary said there were no records of activities since then, but the club had a credit balance of Â£3-0-5.

R.H. Smith moved the club be resuscitated and Miss Marj. Davey seconded.  Elected were: President, Mr R.H. Smith; Vice-Presidents, Messrs McGrath & M.G. Dobson; Secretary, Clem Davey and Treasurer, Mr F. Pontifex.
