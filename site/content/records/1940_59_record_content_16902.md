Storm Passage from

Being upset.

A small plate attached says it was presented by William Stodder 20/8/24.

Rumour says it was found in the Baldina District.  It would be interesting to know its origin.  The three fragments of the plate originally placed at Memory Cove are preserved in the National Gallery, North Terrace, Adelaide.
