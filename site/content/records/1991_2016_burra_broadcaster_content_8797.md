Letter.  Ian Auhl writes, pointing out that the J150 year has seen an emphasis in Burra on history, heritage and tourism.  There will naturally be a reaction in the coming year and a need for a balance between heritage, tourism and Burra’s role as a service centre.  He suggests part of the answer is as it has always been – loyalty to the town and its institutions with local shopping and the use of local services.
