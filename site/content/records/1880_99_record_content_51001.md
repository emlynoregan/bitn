Grow said Murphy wanted an outrageous £12 and later £10.

Thomas Murphy, his brother, gave similar evidence.

The horse had been bought from Bagot, Shakes & Lewis for £4.

C. Grow said they had both started from the standpipe in Market Square.  Murphy was ahead and whipping his horses all the way, keeping Grow against the side of the road, ‘we were racing’, ‘if Murphy had given me a fair share of the road the accident wouldn’t have happened.’

The accident occurred when Grow pulled to the near side to allow the passage of a vehicle coming the other way.

Thomas Hastie valued the horse at £5.  The verdict was for £5 with each party to pay its own costs.
