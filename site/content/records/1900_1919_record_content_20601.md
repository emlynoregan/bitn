Football.  The Kooringa Football Club social at the Burra hotel on Tuesday is reported in 2 columns.

W.H. Hardy took the chair.  Speakers expressed their disappointment at the failure of players to turn up after being picked for a game.  This resulted in teams sometimes starting with as few as 12 players.  The second round had as a consequence not been finished as the Ramblers and Aberdeen were unable to finish the season.

[The report also reveals that by the time speeches had started some of the crowd had consumed plenty of alcohol.]

Mr Macindoe reported results:

Team	Played	Won	Drawn	Lost	Points For	Points Against

Kooringa	13	11	1	1	847	242

Aberdeen	13	4	2	7	260	408

Ramblers	13	2	1	10	227	624
