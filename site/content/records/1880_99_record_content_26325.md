Editorial on the opening of the railway to Silverton last Friday.  This and the connection soon to Broken Hill effectively annexes the Barrier mineral district to SA.

‘Of course the fact is patent to all that the opening of this new line means a death blow to the prosperity of Burra, whose chief trade for years has been with the north-east of South Australia and with the west of New South Wales and south-west of Queensland . . .’

But the development of the mineral interests could never have been done by teams.  A population of nearly 10,000 in the area comes mostly from SA.

Not only has the Barrier district afforded employment for otherwise unemployed people in the colony, but tradespeople almost everywhere have benefited from the circulation of the cash derived from these.  Bad as times have been, they would have been much worse, but for the Barrier.
