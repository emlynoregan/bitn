Goyder Council has agreed to lease the Burra Visitor Centre to BRTBA for two years.  For the National Trust, this leaves the way clear for negotiations on the management of Council owned sites.  The Trust is proposing to lease Council’s tourism sites (excluding the Visitor Centre) for the price of the Council’s share of the Burra Passport.  This will be considered at the November meeting of Council.  If there is no agreement, the Trust will revert to managing its own sites after 31 December 2002.
