Cricket.  Serjeant Buzfuz, in his cricket notes, says the Aberdeen team had Herbert and Butterworth from the Burra team in their side.  [‘Onlooker ‘ disputes this, regarding Herbert as a genuine Aberdeen player this season.]  Buzfuz says there are no rules preventing a person from being in more than one club anyway, and such is common in Adelaide.
