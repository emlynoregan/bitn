Burra Burra Hospital Inc.  Board of Management 31 August.

Mr E. Finch was elected Chairman for the coming year.

Enquiries are being made to secure a washing and drying machine.  Manufacture of this type of machinery is still controlled, but the Board hopes for a satisfactory report soon.  In the meantime the Board thanked Mr Bachli for lending a wringer until the Hospital property could be repaired.

For August there was a daily average of 25 patients and on 31 August there were 33 patients.
