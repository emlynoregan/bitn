Centenary Education Week

[An extract from an article by the Director of Education W.J. Adey provides some useful points of reference from the history of education in SA.]

There was virtually no Government involvement in education in SA for the first ten years of the colony.

In 1844 there were 26 schools in the colony with a total attendance of about 719.  Of the total 14 were in the city, 6 in the suburbs and 6 in the country.

The Collegiate School of St Peter opened on 11 July 1847 in the Trinity Church Schoolroom, with 11 boys.

Pulteney St Church of England Grammar School opened in May 1848.

Prince Alfred College began in 1867.

In 1849 the Legislative Council passed an Ordinance setting up a Board of Education with provision for a capitation grant to augment fees teachers received from pupils.  It was criticised for providing State Aid for sectarian teaching.  A new Education Act in 1851 licensed school teachers and fixed salaries.

There was a University Act in 1874 and primary education was radically changed with the Education Act of 1875.  This established a Council of Education, which was empowered to establish public schools, appoint teachers and inspectors and to define courses.  Attendance was to be compulsory from 7-13 years of age and fees ranges from 4d to 6d a week, though indigent children were excused from payment.

In 1892 education became free for most students.

In 1905 primary school instruction was broadened and a state secondary system was established.  Adelaide High school was opened along with nine district high schools.

The 1915 Education act provided for the establishment of primary, secondary, technical and agricultural departments.

The first Government secondary school was the Advanced School for Girls at Grote Street, established in 1879 and some higher work was done at Sturt Street School from 1900, but the SA Secondary System as such dates only from 1907-08.  It now provides a good general education for those leaving at the ages 15-17 to enter the commercial or industrial world or home occupations as well as providing further courses for those wishing to follow higher professional callings.  There is an Agricultural School at Fullarton and 20 technical and trade schools.
