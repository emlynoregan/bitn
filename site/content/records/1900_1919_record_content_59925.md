Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial Hall v. a Soldiers’ Monument.  Last Thursday a meeting was held to elect two representatives to attend a further district meeting to resolve the question.  About 20 attended and E.W. Crewes took the chair.  The Mayor said he had for some years advocated a memorial for fallen soldiers.  At the last meeting held it had been unanimously decided to erect a memorial of some kind in Market Square and that was generally accepted till a few weeks ago and he had received many promises of support.  Recently the RSL had sent invitations to the District Councils to send delegates to consider erecting a memorial hall in Burra.  The Town Council had not been invited and even after discussing the omission with the secretary of the RSL no invitation had been received.  The Mayor was given to understand that the proposed hall would cost c. £7,000.  The RSL had accommodation that, though not good enough, would serve for the time being and he did not like to see division on the matter.  He had called this meeting to appoint delegates to meet others from the district to reach a final decision.  It would be thought to be folly to erect a building costing £7,000 that would need a caretaker otherwise the upkeep would be heavy.

W.D. Thompson, secretary of the RSL explained that the calling of the meeting short circuited extending an invitation to the Town Council.  The returned men felt they had a right to put forward a proposal if they so chose.  Their proposal was to erect a memorial hall for c. £6,500, not a hall for entertainment or meetings.  Each district would have a bay in the hall for war trophies and memorial tablets and perhaps some guns in the central space.  The League was trying to win, but not to force the people’s hands.  Two plans were being considered.

A large hall with shop front and arcade with residential quarters and overhead offices with the rents to pay for the upkeep.

A hall with bays and lawns in front at a smaller cost.

Cr Radford was sympathetic to the League, but felt it had erred in not inviting town delegates.  He thought the hall very ambitious and in 40-50 years the returned men would not be here.  Adelaide had only raised c. £6,500 for a hall.

The Mayor said delegates had already resolved on erecting a Market Square memorial.

Cr Radford thought they had agreed to erect something in Burra.

Mr Sara said if the Mayor is correct then no further delegates are needed.

The mayor said the previous meeting had directed delegates to hold local meetings and he was to hold one in Burra.  This meeting should appoint two delegates and instruct them to vote one way or the other.

Mr Thompson favoured the memorial hall, which would be more like a museum, not a meeting hall and he said he already had one promise of £1,000.  He moved the meeting support a hall.  2nd Mr Lott.  Mr McLaren moved a further public meeting be called.

The Mayor could see no reason for a second meeting – this one had been sufficiently advertised.

Mr Winnall thought it beyond reason to ask the district to support a £6,500 museum of no utility, which would cost a lot to maintain.

Mr Thompson said the League would support anything decided by the district.  He could not say it would do so for this meeting alone.

Cr Radford thought the meeting could not instruct the delegates how to vote.

Mr Ruthven said there was no use appointing them if the meeting couldn’t instruct them.

In response to a question the Mayor said the monument was expected to cost c. £1,500.

The Mayor & Mr Winnall were elected delegates.

Mr Thompson moved the meeting adjourn to a date fixed to ensure a full public meeting.

Mr Winnall said if Mr Thompson’s motion was lost the question would be settled in favour of a monument as that is the position of the Mayor and himself.

The resolution was put and lost.
