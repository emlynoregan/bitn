Burra Institute Annual Meeting was held on Monday.  M. Pederson, the retiring President, took the chair.  The Institute is about £4 overdrawn, which is a good result for a year in which the Delco system of electric lighting was installed for c. £270 and a new piano was bought for £134.  J. Drew was elected President with E.J. Harris as Vice-President, C.D. Wilkinson as Treasurer and Mr Penrose as Honorary Secretary.
