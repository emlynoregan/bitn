Burra Town Council, Special Meeting 15 May.

There is printed a long report from F.W. Holder, Town Clerk, on the need for an accurate town survey, but since this will require an examination of all titles where subdivision has occurred - perhaps of half a dozen within a hundred yards - the job is much bigger and thus more expensive than first thought.  Only Redruth was laid out by a Government Surveyor.  Different surveyors, not always in harmony, have laid out Kooringa, Aberdeen, New Aberdeen, Millerton, Graham, Llwchyr, Roach Town and Hampton.  Much of the town’s building etc. has been taken from iron pins placed in the ground, but they and the field books disagree with the registered plans and much delicate adjustment will be needed.  The work must be done accurately or not at all and every passing week increases the difficulty.  No large saving of money could compensate for an inaccurate survey.  The very least that is needed is a plan of 40’ to 1” and even at that an encroachment of 4’ would appear as only 1/10”.
