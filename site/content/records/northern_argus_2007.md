Burra Lutherans gathered last Sunday at the site of the original Lutheran Church in Burra for the dedication of a memorial cairn opposite the Court House in Burra North.  The cairn was erected by Roger Frahn and Owen Schulz and identifies the nearby ruins as the foundations of the original church built in 1851 to serve the needs of families who came from the Harz Mountains in Germany as smelters.  Not long after being built it was nearly deserted when the men went to the Victorian goldfields. It was later rented to a lodge and was destroyed by fire after one of its meetings in July 1910.*

[There are several errors in this paragraph:

Construction was begun in 1851, but abandoned in 1852 when the walls were about four feet high.

When men returned from the goldfields it was completed and finally opened for service in September 1861.

It was used by many different groups over several decades.  The Aberdeen Oddfellows’ Lodge seems to have met there for most of the building’s existence.  The building is reported as burning down on the evening of Wednesday 20 July 1910.  Since the lodge meetings were held on alternate Thursdays, this was not following a lodge meeting.  Earlier in the night Mr C. Lowe had been in the premises cleaning the lamps, but no cause for the fire could be established.]
