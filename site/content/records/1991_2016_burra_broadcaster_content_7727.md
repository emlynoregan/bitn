SA Government wishes to halve the number of Councils.  They have said they wish to reduce the number to 59 rather than by one third or to 34 as recommended in the MAG Report.  Councils will be given three months after the appointment of the Board to propose voluntary amalgamations.  The Local Government Board will facilitate assistance so that formalities can be completed in time for the 1997 Council elections.

Councils who do not nominate a proposed amalgamation will be assessed and the Board would then make recommendations on amalgamating to improve efficiency.  A ratepayersâ€™ poll would then follow.  The proposals are different from the recommendations of the Ministerial Advisory Group, which reported last month.
