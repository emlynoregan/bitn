The Melbourne Cup Luncheon was again very successful.  The very talented Woodville Madrigal Choir very capably led by Mrs Rosemary Nairn (nee Reed) entertained the 150 guests.  A cheque for $1,000 will be presented to the Burra Hospital, being the proceeds from the luncheon.  It will be for an emergency resuscitation unit.
