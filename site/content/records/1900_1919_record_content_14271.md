Dr Sangster jun. writes taking issue with the leading article of 21 June.  He denies emphatically that ‘when the girls are once sent there their lives are blighted and opportunities of amelioration lost’.  There are many letters at the Reformatory from former inmates which will refute that.  ‘That they should resort “to actions to deprive them of life” is as difficult to understand as the motive underlying many similar cases in public life.’

We are informed that the public is indignant.

‘In what way, I ask, have the public ever shown the least interest in the working of the institution or practical sympathy with the lot of the girls?’

Dr Sangster also takes issue with describing the staff as a ‘Brigade of four women’ and the insinuation that the matron was light heartedly enjoying herself while the girls were miserable in durance.

The editor claims that he gladly publishes the letter if by doing so ‘The feelings of our correspondent as well as those of others connected with the Redruth Reformatory will be much alleviated when they see it in print.  He claims to have no axe to grind.
