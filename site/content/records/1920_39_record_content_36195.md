Mongolata Gold

Since the last report we have seen further samples of stones from the claim of H.A. Byles absolutely studded with coarse gold.  They were taken from an old claim originally pegged by a prospector named Bywaters some 4-5 years ago.  He has worked it intermittently since, but not of late.  This claim has now been registered by H.A. Byles who has worked it since 8 October.  The greatest depth so far reached is only 4ft.  The country is rugged and hilly.  There is an opinion that alluvial gold might be found further down, but that is on freehold and the claim is on leasehold.  Two big stones from the claim are said to show what is known as bar gold.  Mr Rampton is another prospector very satisfied with his claim.

There are now 20-30 claims pegged out, but shortage of water is a problem: it has to be carted in from Baldina Creek.  The main shows are on the west side of the hill, but there are reports of a find on the east side too.  We have been told that Mr John Moulden now of England and a brother of Sir Frank Moulden who is connected with BHP was staying with the late F.T. Jones, a former Mongolata pastoralist, some 20 years ago and then expressed the opinion that there was gold in three or four hills there.
