Coca Cola Games

Four BCS students represented the school in the Country West Zone at last weekendâ€™s Schoolboys & Schoolgirls Championships.

Cheryl Day won gold in the U15 400 m, silvers in the 200 m and the U19 4 x 400 m relay and a bronze in the U15 100 m.

Adam Day won gold in the U19 400 m hurdles and silvers in U19 400 m, 800 m and 4 x 400 m relay.

Tasma Wooton won gold in U19 Javelin and the U19 discus.

Petrea Piggott won gold in U19 400 m hurdles and in the U19 4 x 400 m relay.

Later in the report it says Petrea also secured a silver in the 4 x 400 m relay [presumably in a different age bracket] and bronzes in the U17 javelin and the U19 400 m.
