Goyder Council and A. & K. McBride have settled in court a disagreement over a contract of sale involving O’Connor’s shed, with the original deal being kept.

Council minutes from February 2002 record a contract of sale between the Council and A.P. & K.L. McBride.  This was reported at the time as involving the transfer to the Council of five vacant allotments on Taylor St and one on Cooper St and four blocks at the south end of the town, earmarked for cemetery extensions.  The shed and its surrounds were to be transferred to McBrides.

Council CEO said the Ombudsman was called in at the request of local resident Doug Wiltshire, to look at the sale process.  The Ombudsman recommended Council advertise and seek comment on the disposal of community land.  Council’s interpretation of the relevant law was that this sale of land that had been advertised did not need to be further advertised.  After the Ombudsman’s advice the Council was faced with proceedings from McBride’s seeking that Council abide by the sale contract.  Council settled the matter in the Supreme Court last year, with both sides agreeing to pursue the land transfers as in the original agreement.  The contracts and agreements were finalised in March this year, subject to the blocks next to the cemetery being subdivided.  The land transfers went through the Lands Titles Office last week.

O’Connor’s Shed (now McBride’s Shed) was bought in 1989 by the Burra Burra DC in a deal including the tourism bus.  The Council at the time saw the usefulness of continuing to use the site for unhitching road trains and allowed truck operators to use the site free of charge.  Attempts to sell the shed and surrounds in the early 1990s ran into problems due to saleyard access issues and also due to the risk from flooding.  A more recent contract with the Ngadjuri Aboriginal Group also fell through when funding was found to be unavailable.
