I would like to draw the attention of Burra residents to the necessity of completing the Burra Motel project.  The project is within striking distance of raising the finance.  The town would greatly benefit from the increased tourism.  SA is just beginning to see progress in this type of accommodation, which is booming in the eastern states.  Tourism has been growing as we know from the caravan park.  This venture using local finance will keep the returns in the district.
