Cheer-up Society.

The Cheer-up Society, which worked from 1914-19, has been re-established in the [Adelaide] Cheer-up Hut.  Mrs Seager, who was the organiser on the Great War writes again of the rebirth of the organisation and calls for support, not by forming yet another wartime society, but perhaps by utilising the CWA.  The present organiser is Mrs D. Hay.  At present over 1,200 meals are served free to men of the Army Navy and Air Force.
