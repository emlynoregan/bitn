Obituary.  Mr Fred Wheatley died at Colac Victoria late in October aged 76.  Mr Wheatley spent many years in Burra and was at one time employed by the late S.M. Lane as a saddler.  He was bandmaster in 1911 of the band that was dissolved owing to WWI.  He served in the original 10th Battalion as bandmaster and as far as can be ascertained his death leaves Mr H.P. Harris as the only ‘Burra boy’ who went through the Gallipoli Landing as an infantryman.  [Frederick Wheatley born 11 February 1879 Kooringa and therefore aged 79.]
