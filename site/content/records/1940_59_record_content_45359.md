The Anzac Service in Market Square drew 400 people.  This was less than previously because Booborowie and Farrell Flat conducted services of their own.  The Salvation Army was not present either, as in the past year Bandmaster Heaven had died and the band had broken up.   It is now being re-formed.  Mr Tom Roberts, kettle-drummer, headed the returned men.  Mr Roberts recently arrived from England and was in the British army in the war.  Rev. L.H. Pitman conducted the service.  Lt Exon of the Salvation Army gave the address.  Wreaths were laid:

E.R. Davey as President of RSL

R.C. Lott as President of the Air Force Assoc.

J.R. Field for the Demobilised Soldiers’ Assoc.

A.B. Riggs for the Fathers’ Assoc.

F.T. Marston as Mayor of Burra

E.E. Finch for the District Council.
