Weather.  Last week was most changeable.  A thunderstorm on Saturday produced heavy rain for about 20 minutes with a great deal of thunder and lightning.  About two hours later hailstones the size of marbles fell, followed by an even heavier rainstorm.  The creek rose and washed away the recently constructed ford at the Pig & Whistle.  Redruth received only about half the rain recorded in Kooringa where water penetrated a number of premises and caused considerable damage.  Sunday was unsettled with sun and some showers.  Petherton received about 1½ inches of rain in 20 minutes while very little fell between Mt Bryan and Burra.

At Hanson a flash of lightning wrenched the hook from Mr Geyer’s hand as he was mixing concrete and concrete splashed in his eye causing him to be laid up for a few days.  A carpenter at Hanson was also slightly shocked by a nearby strike.
