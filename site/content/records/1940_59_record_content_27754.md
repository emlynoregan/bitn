The contractors expect to complete the building approximately in October.  It is our intention to open it free of debt and this can only be done by the co-operation of all.  Our objective is to raise only Â£600, with donations acknowledged in theis paper and with records kept in the club rooms.  We would also appreciated any donations of suitable furnishings.
