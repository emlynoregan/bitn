Travelling Stock Roads.

P.L. Killicoat presided at a meeting at the Institute last Friday night re the closing of travelling stock reserves.  J. Lewis JP spoke first.  In 1860 it was found necessary for pastoralists to have wide roads for travel and in 1861 a petition to the Commissioner of Crown Lands asked that all new surveys be provided with 20 chain routes.  Up till then only 1 chain width roads had been provided.  The later Hundreds thus had 20 chain routes.  In 1886 some people petitioned for such routes to be cut up and added to their properties with some bad consequences.  In 1889 a committee chaired by Hon. J.J. Duncan sat for 13 days on the matter and concluded that the routes should be retained for their original use and recommended that stock roads be dedicated as travelling stock reserves.  The road now particularly in question is between Baldina Creek and Apoinga.  The petition to cut it up is based on vermin and noxious weeds in it, but the income from commonage on it more than meets the cost of controlling vermin and weeds by the DC.  The present Government favoured 3 chain roads.  Lewis did not agree – they would result in animals of poorer condition with poorer wool.  When forced onto made roads stock create great damage, especially in winter.  Railing sheep costs £40 per 1,000 compared with £10 or less for droving.  Cutting up the roads would see very few new landowners and the idea of workingmen’s blocks between Baldina and Apoinga was an absurdity.  The Advertiser writer was quite wrong to assert that the move met with general support.  Mr Lewis moved the Government be asked to remove from sale all land used and known as Travelling Stock Reserves. [And a whole paragraph more of detail.]

Mr Alford supported the above.

10,000 sheep on a 3 chain road meant only the front sheep got feed.

J. Melrose of Ulooloo gave support in a letter.

E.W. Crewes was puzzled to know who expressed the support claimed in the Advertiser!  He moved that where such reserves have been let on miscellaneous lease so much as necessary for travelling stock be cancelled.  Mr Scott 2nd and cited a nearby case where much harm had been done by the loss of the reserve with little benefit to anyone in return.

Mr Nobes, manager of Parnell & Bowman, Moonta, was a heavy buyer of stock at Burra and agreed that if routes go the town’s popularity as a market would decline.

Mr Alford moved the Government allow holders of workingmen’s blocks on stock roads to exchange the same for other lands if available and agreeable to present holders.  2nd J. Lewis and carried.
