Ray Carter, Secretary of the Black Springs Hall, writes spelling out with great clarity why charges for hall use need to be made and attacking the ‘anonymous’ Leighton writer whom he identifies as living at Black Springs when the hall was built, in the house ‘commonly known as a post office’ and saying he had ‘only about 250 yards to journey to get to the meeting’, but apparently decided not to attend because dances might be held there.
