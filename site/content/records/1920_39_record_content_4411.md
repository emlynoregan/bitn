Burra Brass Band meeting last Monday.  Mr E.C. Hammond resigned as conductor on account of the lack of interest shown by members from the musical point of view.  They could put up the same class of program they had been giving at any time with one or two rehearsals, so it was a waste of time having one rehearsal a week.  The Band will go into recess until another conductor becomes available.  The Band is reported to be in funds and has donated Â£1-1-0 to the Kerin Relief Fund.
