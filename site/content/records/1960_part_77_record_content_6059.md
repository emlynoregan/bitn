Booborowie Hall Recreation Committee has undertaken a cropping project in the Booborowie Parklands for improvements to the hall and the recreation ground.  When the project began in 1959 the first season was very dry and only 21 bags were obtained and this was kept as seed.  The 1960 season was more successful and the committee was able to sell 89 bags of grade 3 and 186 bags of grade 4 as well as keeping 21 bags for seed.

[Details of who did what are printed.]  A larger area will be sown this year than the 27 acres sown last year.

[Details of working bees are given.]

As a result of the committeeâ€™s work so far a tank has been erected alongside the windmill and pipes laid to both toilets, paths have been laid and grass cleared.  At the end of the football season it is intended to grade the oval and install a cricket pitch to centralise sporting facilities.
