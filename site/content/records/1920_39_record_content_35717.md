Rev. E.S. Jew preached at Redruth on Sunday evening.  He was riding his motor bike home to Hallett when about three miles outside of Hallett his lights failed.  Soon after that he collided with another motor-bike with a sidecar that was also unlit.  He was thrown off violently and fractured his jaw.  Mr E. Thomas, on his way home from church, found him and took him to the Burra hospital where he will be for several weeks.  It is believed he told the other driver he would be all right and taking Mr Jew at his word he went on his way.

[This last sentence was corrected in the next issue: he remained with Rev. Jew until help arrived.]
