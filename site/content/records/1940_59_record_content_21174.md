Rev. & Mrs Martin was recently farewelled from the Burra-Kooringa Methodist Church, after a stay of three years.  Rev. Martin had come out of semi-retirement to meet a need resulting from war conditions.  Mrs Martin had been a splendid support for her husband.  A presentation of a handsome travelling rug was made.
