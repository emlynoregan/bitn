Advt.  Burra Pictures.  The secretary of the Burra Town Hall Picture Committee reports a drop in attendance for the past financial year of 416 or 9% and consequently a loss of $110.

Attendances:

If attendances do not significantly increase serious consideration will have to be given to closing down the Town Hall Pictures.  This would be a pity, but it is hardly worthwhile obtaining the better films available if the residents are not going to patronise them.  Three persons work voluntarily each Saturday night.  It costs $17 plus the film hire (average $24) to put on a show.  To cover this attendance will have to rise considerably from the present average of 87.  One need to lift attendance is the better behaviour of children and teenagers present.  Parents could help by coming along and keeping their own children under control.  The outcome is in the hands of the residents of Burra.  It is stressed that the aim of increasing attendance cannot be achieved without a great improvement in the behaviour of the children attending.  The committee has found it necessary to abolish the front stalls and charge 30c for children anywhere downstairs â€“ they had been buying 20c seats and moving into 30c seats during the program.
