Mongolata Goldfield

Mongolata Central GM Syndicate

Contractors are clearing up mullock and stripping back south of old workings.  Advanced 5ft on a slight underlay.  The bottom is slate on which is a 15‚Äù layer of ironstone and quartz showing traces.  A small fissure in this contains gold varying from traces to 10dwt.  The country is much disturbed.

Baldina Mongolata GM Syndicate directors visited on Monday.  Matters are looking promising.  A recent crushing of 17cwt realised a handsome return of 12oz, but for 1grain.
