Temperance in Kooringa

Mr John Williams of Barossa gave an able lecture to about 300 persons in the Bible Christian Chapel at Kooringa on 30 July.  He spoke for one hour and forty minutes on the Maine Liquor Law in the USA. He was loudly applauded at intervals and sat down to enthusiastic applause.  Mr J. Rowe, the Bible Christian minister presided.  The meeting was unanimously in favour of the Maine Liquor Law.  There are monthly lectures in Kooringa on temperance.  The last two had been given by the Bible Christian ministers Messrs Rowe and Ridclift.  A great many have taken the pledge in the last three months.
