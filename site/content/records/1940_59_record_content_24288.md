The Fathers’ Association has passed a protest motion objecting to the way in which some servicemen and returned prisoners of war were being discharged from the services while being in an unfit state of health to return to civilian life.  There were also complaints about ex-servicemen being charged excessive prices for furniture.  Mr A. Walker moved that the State Council form a committee to advise soldiers on the purchases and another to assist them with the purchase of business/business properties.  There were also questions concerning the provision of houses for ex-servicemen on blocks in the district.
