Whyte Yarcowie Institute has, on application of the trustees, been dissolved and the Institutes Association of SA then offered the Hall to the Hallett DC.  The Council decided that taking over the hall was not in its best interests and a public meeting of residents then decided to take over the hall as an incorporated body.
