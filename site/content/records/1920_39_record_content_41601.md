Local Board of Health

Cr Bevan repeated his question.

The Mayor said Cr Button’s term would expire in a few weeks.

Cr Bevan said they should appoint a new man if Cr Button would not act.

Cr Button said he was not properly appointed and it was the Council’s duty to make the appointment.

He read the letter, already published, from the Chief Secretary.

The Mayor dissented, asserting that the Council and Board of Health were two departments of the one body.

Cr Button dissented from the Mayor’s interpretation.

The Mayor said that the Local Board of Health had always made the appointment.

Cr Button thought the Chief Secretary should know what he was talking about.

The Mayor thought they needed to see all the correspondence.

Cr Bevan thought the Hospital rule was definite.

The Mayor: ‘You young councillors don’t understand this and should not interfere.’

Cr Sampson asserted his right to speak, saying they were not here to consider what had been done in the past.  Because other Mayors had followed the wrong procedure did not make it right.

Cr March wondered why all the argument – why not simply get an answer to the question asked?
