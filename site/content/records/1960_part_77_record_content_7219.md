St Mary’s.  The back-to-St Mary’s Day at Burra was believed to have attracted the largest congregation ever, with approximately 400 at the dedication service.  The dedications (as listed last week) were performed by Rev. R.S.T. Pettet, who was also the celebrant.  Mrs Herb Riggs was convenor of the Guild group who had the tremendous task of serving a buffet luncheon in the RSL Hall and also afternoon tea.  At the 3 p.m. Thanksgiving Evensong Rev. K.T. Jenkins, Chaplain of St Peter’s College, was the preacher and Rev. R.S. Jenner of Burra read the lessons.  The organist was Rev. John Hopton whose father was a former Rector at St Mary’s some 40 years ago.  St Joseph’s Church committee sent greetings and best wishes that were much appreciated.
