Burra Picnic Race Club held a meeting at Thistlebeds Station on Saturday and drew a bigger crowd than in past years with more horses competing and more entertainment for the children and adults.  Club President Chris Taylor and Secretary Reva Cullen said they were very pleased with the success of the day.  A memorial plaque was unveiled to the memory of the late Sadie Radford commemorating her work for the Royal Flying Doctor Service.  Peter Reilly was also presented with a plaque in appreciation of the work and services he has supplied at the track over the years.
