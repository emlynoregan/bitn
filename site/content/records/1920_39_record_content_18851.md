Burra Show Society.   AGM at Eastern Telephone Building 1 March

President I.J. Warnes reported:

The death of James Gallagher was a severe blow to the society.

The Dog Trials were successful; with more entries including from interstate.  The horse events helped the gate.

The Annual Show on 27 & 28 October brought a large crowd, but the second day was windy and dusty which kept many away.  The two day event was a success and entries were more numerous than ever.  Sheep were also well represented and it was pleasing to see smaller producers taking part.

Financially the position is sound.

Assets are valued at £3,050-5-3 and we finished the year with an overdraft of £352-12-1.  The last year, leaving out improvements, showed a profit of £187-14-9.  There was a loss on running special trains of £20-6-5 and on the souvenirs of £18-18-4.  Improvements had cost £620-7-1.  The gate takings rose 33% and the number of members rose 10%.

Improvements.

The railway has been completed and fenced and was used for the first time on Show Day.  The Industrial Hall was doubled in size.  Cattle and sheep yards were enlarged, as was the kitchen.  Two additional tanks were installed.

Mr Radford, as Vice-President, moved the adoption of the report and expected that the next show would see a substantial reduction in the debt.  Mr Bednall offered to act in an honorary capacity for legal advice.  The offer was accepted.

Elected were Patron, C. Bartholomaeus; President, I.J. Warnes; Vice-Presidents, M.A. Radford & S. Robinson.

The committee presented Mr Warnes with a cabinet photograph of each of the 30 members of the General Committee plus the Patron & President.  They were beautifully arranged and framed and were the work of Mr F. Spencer.  Mr Warnes thanked the committee and was clearly astonished and moved by this surprise presentation.  The Secretary, Mr Edwards was voted a salary of £100 p.a.  A list of donors to the New Show Grounds is printed.
