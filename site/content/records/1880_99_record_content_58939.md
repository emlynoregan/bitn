Characteristics of the paper in 1895

Characteristics essentially unchanged from 1893.

Page 1

Large advertisements, some not local.

Page 2

Smaller advertisements.  Local businesses along with sales and public notices.

News sometimes gets a start, but often only a little and it is frequently pushed onto page three before it gets a start.

Page 3

Largely local news and reports from correspondents from surrounding districts.  Occasional pieces from further afield and a few items of humour.  The ‘Sparks’ column continues to be somewhat enigmatic at times.

Page 4

Larger advertisements, mostly not local.

Numbering of issues in 1895.

Numbering of issues in this year was chaotic.  Volume XV continued from its start on 7 December 1892 and ran for the whole of 1895.

Numbers began with 321 on 2 January

And ran to 328 on 27 February and in this sequence 323 & 324 were not used 328 was used twice and 322 was used three times.

On 6 March the number sequence jumped backwards to 310 which had not previously been used in Volume XV.  310 was used twice and then the sequence continued to 327 by 25 December, but with extreme irregularity.

The issues are numbered as follows.  In this sequence the number in round brackets indicates the total number if times used in Volume XV to the end of 1895 and the number in square brackets indicates the times used in an earlier sequence and the year in which this occurred.

310 (2) [1, 1894]

311 (7) [5, 1894]

312 (3 or4) [1 or 2, 1894]

313 (3) [2, 1894]
