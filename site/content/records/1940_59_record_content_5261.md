H.E. Fuss writes as Rector’s Warden to correct the misstatements contained in the letter supposedly written by ‘Olive Bence’.  And he adds ‘I say supposedly deliberately’. 

‘A more vicious and vindictive attack would be hard to find.  A writer who descends to personal abuse, admits the poverty of criticism.’

In fact the Rector holds very liberal ideas on Sunday sport.  If the writer receives very little benefit from worship at St Mary’s ‘it is quite evident that she does not realise, that in religion, more so than in other things; the amount of benefit received, is entirely governed by the amount given.’

Congregations at St Mary’s have fallen, but this is from an entirely different cause from any lack of leadership.  The decline started well before the arrival of Rev. Gray and since he has come 75 members of the Parish have left the town and only 9 have come in their place.  The Rector is to be congratulated for keeping things going in the face of such losses.
