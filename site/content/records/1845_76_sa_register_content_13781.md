Kooringa News, 12 November

Thomas Stewart was arrested by Trooper Simpson on a charge of stealing a £5 note from his companion.  He appeared in court yesterday and was committed for trial at the Supreme Court.

Yesterday the band played in front of the Institute before Rev. W. Davidson took the chair and introduced Rev. T. Lloyd, who delivered a lecture on ‘Self-improvement’.  Mr J.R. Stephens was to have shown a series of dissolving views afterwards, but this had to be cancelled due to technical difficulties.

Shearing in the district is rapidly drawing to a close and several loads of wool have passed through the town in the past week.
