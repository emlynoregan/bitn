Railway Meeting at Mintaro

The meeting took place at the Devonshire Hotel on 17 June.  Mr Thomas Priest took the chair.

[The arguments are already well noted.  The emphasis that distinguished Mintaro concerned the reliance of farmers in that area on Burra as a market and therefore they were most seriously affected by the stoppage of the Burra Mine.  This was stressed in a speech by W.H. Rosman Jnr.

Mr George Faulkner said: ‘Many like himself had got what he had mainly through having a good market at the Burra.’

The first resolution said the line from Forresters to Kooringa was extremely desirable.

The second resolution said that as the great surplus of labour in the colony was mainly owing to the high cost of transport and low prices for produce, and given that the railway would in great measure remedy this, it should be proceeded with at once.

The third resolution said that as a great calamity had overtaken the colony and particularly the northern areas, the Government was urged to mitigate that evil by the immediate construction of the proposed railway.

The fourth resolution urged construction simultaneously at various points along the route.

The resolutions all passed without dissent.

The petition to the House of Assembly was then read and procedural matters agreed to.

[Much more detail is presented.]
