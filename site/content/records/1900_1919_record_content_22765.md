The Tilly Kubel Case.  [Further details occupy 1½ columns.]

Matilda J. Kubel (Tilly) went missing on Wednesday.  Pearl Montgomery, the nurse girl, found her missing at 6.30 a.m.  Two letters in her room instructed Mrs Sangster what to do with Tilly’s machine and money.  The bed had been slept in.  Searches were instigated.  Mrs Sangster and the Doctor are at a loss to explain why Miss Kubel disappeared so quickly.  Tilly had not complained of being despondent and had been an excellent servant.  There was a belief she had thrown herself into the Mine Pool, but it has been dragged and it is now thought she may have thrown herself down a shaft.  The Doctor doesn’t believe this, as she had access to poisons in his dispensing room had suicide been her intention.  Dynamite in the Mine Pool on Monday failed to lead to any discovery.  Her sister at Farrell’s Flat (Mrs Przibilla) was notified.  A reward for information has been posted.
