Burra Progress Assoc.  AGM was held in the Institute Lodge Room on Tuesday night.

Report of the President.

A number of things had been done in the year, some unnoticed.  An effort had been made to re-open the mine, but subsequent reports had been unfavourable.

Efforts had been made to establish a military camp at Burra, to ensure that the Saturday afternoon closing of shops be universal and to improve roads generally.

In the coming year they would try to attract the trade of those working on the Morgan-Whyalla Pipeline.

Mr F.T. Sara was elected Chairman and F.L. Worth, Vice-Chairman.

The Assoc. will support the Councilâ€™s effort for a Sunday afternoon train.

There was debate on whether Saturday afternoon trading was desirable or not.  The present Bill for universal closing was introduced by the Leader of the Opposition.  Eventually a sub0committee was appointed to consider all aspects of Saturday trading.
