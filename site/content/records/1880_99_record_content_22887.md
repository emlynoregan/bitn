Silverton Railway.  The extension of the railway to the Barrier Ranges [It was then operating to Manna Hill] will prejudicially affect the Burra District.  Wool etc. from the north-east will now travel north to this line.  Teamsters will be deprived of their living and many small farmers will find a portion of their income ended.  Those maintaining teams will also suffer with fewer hands needed in machinistsâ€™ establishment.
