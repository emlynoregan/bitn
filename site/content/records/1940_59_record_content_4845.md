East of Burra on 23, 24 & 25 January the rains came in no niggardly manner.  Miles of fencing were swept away and many livestock were engulfed in the turgid waters.  Roads and railways were rendered impassable and great damage done by erosion.  Telephone lines and fenced became inextricably entwined.

Mrs Harold Pearse, who heard the roar of waters along Spring Hut Creek, was swept away while trying to save her poultry, but was in turn saved by her son and maid.  Drums, distilled water jars, tools, tyres and the entire kitchen wood heap were swept Murray-wards.  The waters rose to within six inches of the hood of the Glenbower stranded Ford car and left hay straw on the telephone line nine feet from the ground.  But despite all this we rejoice because we can replace the fences, restock again and generally take the helm once more, but we cannot put life into dead and dying animals nor replenish dried up watercourses nor make the parched earth spring forth in verdure, no matter how solid our optimism.  Therefore we rejoice and give praise to the All-beneficent Being.
