Characteristics of the paper in 1938

In general the paper carried a good deal of local news supplemented with articles of a general interest and a good many reflecting the rising political tensions in Europe.  These general articles acted as fillers and fluctuated considerably.  They included a good many humorous items.

There are no editorial as such, though there are occasionally editorial comments or editorial point of view in major articles.

Page 3

Some advertising and a mixture of local and other news with a fluctuating amount of ‘fillers’ of a general nature.

Pages 2 or 3 usually had somewhere a column of ‘People We Know’: a column of local comings and goings.  School notes for the activities of the district’s schools are a regular feature.
