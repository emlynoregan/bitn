The UFS Rural Expo at the Burra Town Hall on Friday drew about 450-500 persons. There was a barbecue and many stalls, a display of heritage quilts [photo], computers, sausage making [photo of Sue & Len Hentschke], wool spinning and microwave oven demonstrations, among other things. Looking Good Boutique launched its spring collection and proceeds went to the Farmersâ€™ Fighting Fund.  [Heritage Quilts were drawn from two classes making quilts for the Jubilee Year celebrations.]
