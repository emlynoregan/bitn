Obituary.  Mr William Garden Gunn died 4 August at the Burra hospital.  He was born at Birkenhead and his father was Harbour Master at Pt Adelaide.  The family attended Port Adelaide Presbyterian Church for many years.  As a lad he went to Victoria to learn farming and returned to SA with his then employer, to live at Mundalla in the South East.  He bought his first property at Booborowie over forty years ago and developed virgin land into a most productive farm for Hunter River Lucerne seed growing.  He gradually increased his acreage and became so well known that orders for his seed came from interstate as well as locally.  He also had a small Friesian Herd.  He was a member of Willalo Methodist Church and a trustee for 32 years.  He is survived by a widow, Rachel Gunn of Melbourne.  [Born William Garden Gunn 26 February 1887 Birkenhead SA: died William Gardner Gunn 4 August 1964 Burra, residence Booborowie.  Since a wife Areta Lizzie Grace nee Chantrill died in 1945, his widow must be a second wife.]
