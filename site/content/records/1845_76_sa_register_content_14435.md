Election Meeting at Kooringa

Mr T.S. Porter JP was voted into the chair and introduced Mr Neales, who said:

He supported the continuation of Bible reading in schools.

Supported the Real Property Act.

Wanted land placed on the market where it was wanted.

Was not opposed to taxation on land.

Wished to see sensible economy and a fair day’s work, for which he thought there should be fair wages.

He commented on the inconsistencies in Government expenditure in the district; £130 on roads, £177 on the Court House and £3,000 on the Gaol.

The amount of land sold suggested much more should have been spent in the district.

The Government must support schools in country areas.

While not wishing to see the total end to immigration, he thought it was not required at present when many were unemployed.  It should bring people when labour was needed.

Many miners had gone to the gold diggings in Victoria, but he felt they would return to the discoveries of copper at Wallaroo.

He favoured some protective duties for colonial goods.

Personally he would rather be independent than be paid as a Member of Parliament, but he conceded that country members had greater expenses and should be recompensed for travelling etc., consequently he would not oppose a bill for payment of members, though personally he did not require it.

He did not think that at present an expensive railway to Burra was required.

He favoured District Courts and the payment of jurors.

As a buyer of shares he had been connected with the Burra Mine since 1845.

Mr Dale then tried to speak, but there was much confusion and difficulty in making himself heard over it.  He sought to prove that Mr Kingston had said that 7/- a day was too much for a working man.  He then proposed Mr Neales as a fit and proper candidate.  Mr Kingston was also proposed and when put to the meeting a show of hands favoured Mr Neales.
