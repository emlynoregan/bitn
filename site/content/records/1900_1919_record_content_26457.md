Short & Sharpâ€™

Many people went to the Hanson tea meeting from Burra.

Obituary.  Mrs Duncan Blair died at her home in Leighton last week.

Rev. Nield gave addresses on the local option question in Market Square on Saturday and Sunday evenings.  One or two missiles were thrown, but missed their mark.
