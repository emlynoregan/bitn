Australia Post, having adopted economic rationalism is now selling off properties all over Australia.  The old Burra Post and Telegraph office, built in 1860* is to be sold.  Mr Laver Manager of Australia Post said it had been used as a postmaster’s residence and was now surplus to requirements.  The old building in Market Street has not operated as a Post Office for 30 years when the PMG Department (as it then was) built the new Post Office in Commercial Street in 1963.†  The sale is expected to be announced within weeks.

[*Although the original building dated from 1860, it was rebuilt in 1911 and very little of the original structure remains.

†The new Post Office was opened in 1960; not 1963.]

Burra Arts Council Branch is celebrating its first birthday.  Despite a small membership, it has achieved many things in its first year:
