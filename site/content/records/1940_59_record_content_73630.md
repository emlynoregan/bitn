Burra Burra District Council: Chairman’s Résumé of the Year’s Work.

At the 1955 elections E.L. McWaters, T.D.J. Beckwith and myself were re-elected unopposed and Cr D.T. Wedding was elected to replace W.J. Shattock in Booborowie Ward.  The non-retiring members being J.R. Barker, H.R. Earl, J.H.J. Stevens and E. Finch.  Cr E.L. McWaters retired early in 1956.  He had represented Baldina Ward and been Chairman 1950-53.  Cr J.F. Warnes was elected unopposed to fill this vacancy.  At the elections this year Crs J.R. Barker and H.R. Earle did not seek re-election and were replaced unopposed by A.D. Radford (Mongolata Ward) and J.F. Hogan (Leighton Ward).  During the year the Falkai family became naturalised Australian Citizens.  The Council has kept in touch with the Burra & District Swimming Pool movement and the Burra Hospital.  The Total assessment was £60,489, representing a capital value of £1,209,780.  This year a new assessment has to be made for the new financial year.

The year began in credit £1,025-6-6 and with a lot of works planned, it was decided to increase the rate to the limit of 4/- in the pound, to produce an income of £12,097-16-0.  (An increase of 16%.)

This was to allow improvements to district roads, which unfortunately have suffered through two wet winters.  The district has a debit of £711-2-5 at 30 June 1956.  Special efforts were made to improve the Morgan Road and the Eastern Stock Road, as these are not eligible for main road grants.  A total of £3,726-5-7 was expended using Federal Rural areas Grants and Council Contributions.

£10,000 was allotted by the Highways Department for main roads and an extra £2,000 was allocated specifically for the Kapunda-Peterborough main road 45.  The Lochiel-Burra Main Road 46 also needed emergency work.  The streets of Hanson and Farrell Flat were sealed before winter set in.

[Figures expended on individual roads are then listed.]

The relocation of the main road Hanson-Black Springs was a major project and it got under way in November 1955.  Much has now been done with half a mile of seven miles of sub-base remaining to be constructed.  It now needs three inches of screenings to be opened for traffic.  Expenditure this year was £24,095-15-1.  (An extra £5,000 was made available over the original grant.)

A new blue slate quarry near Booborowie shows promise.

[The report then deals with details of plant and labour expenditure.]

Cemeteries at Booborowie and Farrell Flat were attended to and aid was also given with the Burra Cemetery.  There were two burials in the district for the year.

The move to have Booborowie and Leighton Wards transferred to the Spalding DC was not favoured by the Council.  Reduction in size is not a progressive move and other remedies must be found.  In some measure this has been done by increasing road work in the year in the wards, though further efforts will be needed.

The grasshopper plague was reduced to minor proportions by the use of insecticide, especially for Eastern station owners.  Some landowners suffered unfortunate damage, but generally damage was kept to a minimum.

Fire fighters under the supervision of Mr Frank Reed have had a busy season with seven outbreaks.  Burning off along the railway line again contributed to a big reduction in the fire hazard.  Five cases of poliomyelitis were reported and one of infectious hepatitis.  Early in the financial year the office assistant Miss C.B. Murphy resigned and was replaced by Miss M. Hopkins.
