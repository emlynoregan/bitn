Burra Town Council, Special meeting last Thursday to consider Sunday games.

The Tennis Association had written asking if the agreement with the Kooringa Club and its prohibition of Sunday play extended also to the Aberdeen courts.  It said three days were needed for the tournament.

Cr Dow said a special letter had been sent to the Kooringa Tennis Club a couple of months previously emphasising the agreement again in terms of Good Friday and Sundays.

Cr Kellaway asked about the Aberdeen Club â€“ he did not think the agreement there mentioned Good Friday or Sundays.
