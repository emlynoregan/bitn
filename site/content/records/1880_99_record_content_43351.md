Next door were tents for tea and dinner under Mrs P.L. Killicoat aided by Mrs T. Sandland and the Misses Cave, Bampton and Gebhardt.

‘At times the tea-fight raged so furiously that access to the desideratum was impossible and seats were at a premium.’

Other stalls sold fancy goods, lollies and produce and unsold goods were disposed of by a Dutch auction conducted by W.G. Hawkes.

Misses Coglin and Sprod controlled the liquor traffic, yet we did not see a single case of insobriety – remarkable considering the variety of beverages sold.

There was a Maypole Dance and also an Aunt Sally, quoits and pony rides.

The Burra Brass band attended and so did the Mounted Infantry, which went through manoeuvres.

At least 900 people passed through the gates.

[Strawberry fetes became a very popular feature of money-raising activities in the district until at least WWII, and in many years it would have been possible to have attended half a dozen or more without undue effort, but this appears to have been the very first one.  St Mary’s continued for some years to hold a major strawberry fete, but Redruth Methodists were also to become notable among the many others.]
