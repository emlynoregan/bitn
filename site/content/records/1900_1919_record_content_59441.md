League of Loyal Women.  The League’s tea-rooms in Burra closed on Friday after 6 months operation in the hall of Pearce’s Building.  The mayor attended and gave a short address.  The tea-rooms had been raising funds for Trench Comforts.  That need had now ceased.  £100 had been raised.  One of the returned men is starting a tea-room in the premises owned by J. Allen and he hoped folk would support him.  Rev. Hopton also spoke & Mrs W.G. Hawkes responded & there were also musical items.
