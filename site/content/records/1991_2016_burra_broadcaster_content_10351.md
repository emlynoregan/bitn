Burra Picnic Race Club meeting at Thistlebeds was again a success, though due to a number of competing events attendance was lower than in previous years.  Paul O’Bryan’s Band kept people dancing till the small hours and Day Care members provided food till 2 a.m.  The reasonable profit allowed a reserve for next year as well as $1,000 for the RFDS and $500 to the Nursing Mothers Association of Burra.
