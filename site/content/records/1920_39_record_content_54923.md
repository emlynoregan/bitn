Mongolata Goldfield

Curlew Syndicate crushed 25 tons and expect good results.

Byles’ Mongolata GM Co. announces it has struck a wide lode at 642ft and had not reached its end at 664ft in the tunnel at the 92ft level.

This is believed to be an important development.  A bulk sample from the tunnel taken between 647ft & 652ft shows 4oz to the ton.  Surface indications suggest the lode would extend more than 1,000ft.
