Burra Traders’ Association has followed up Tim Horsnell’s advice that they need to take a closer look at themselves and determine ways of gaining members and credibility and of achieving the aims of their constitution.  A three person team has been set up to assess strengths and weaknesses and evolve a viable business plan.  There will be a Christmas Street Party on 22 December.
