Burra Primary School also ended the year with a concert on 20 December.  Enrolment for the year was 367.  Â£1-8-0 was raised at the concert for the Burra Hospital.  Prizes were distributed by the Mayoress, Mrs W.C.L. West.  [Personal interest: among others H. Fuss and M. Fuss did not miss a day for 1906.  Without further checking the identities are not clear: possibilities are Hilary, Hasle & Morris.  The latter two being sons of H.J.A. Fuss.]
