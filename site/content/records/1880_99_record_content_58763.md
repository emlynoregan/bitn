Burra Town Council, Friday last.

The meeting began with congratulations all round.

Committees were appointed for the coming year.

The appointment of officers was held over till next meeting.

The auditors, J.D. Cave & T.T. Shortridge wrote a strong letter to Council complaining that at a public meeting of North Ward ratepayers W.T. Rabbich had criticised the position and actions of the auditors and said the last audit was a ‘mere farce’ and was not concluded until March 1895.  As the last payments for 1894 were not signed for till the Council meeting of 5 January 1895, the accounts could not be ready for the auditors till 7 January 1895.  The audit was then done and the balance sheets were presented at the next Council meeting on 25 January.  The auditors considered the statement of Cr Rabbich to be defamatory and asked for a minute to be recorded stating that all due diligence was made by the auditors in auditing last year’s accounts.

Cr Rabbich tried to move that the letter be not received, but Cr Sampson said the auditors have every right to refute the statements of Cr Rabbich and he moved it be received.

The Town Clerk produced the books showing the audit was actually completed nine days before it was required by the Act.

Cr Winnall 2nd the motion and Cr Sampson added that Cr Rabbich’s attack was very unfair at a time and place where the auditors were not present to defend themselves.

There were reports concerning two bridges and the recent flood.  The one near Mr Finch’s was not damaged, but that near Mr Newman’s was washed away.  A committee was appointed to confer with the District Council on what can be done with the road to Princess Royal.
