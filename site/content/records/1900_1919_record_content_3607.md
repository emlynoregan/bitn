Children’s Peace Demonstration Committee was offered 6d per head last year by the Government for those children participating in the ‘Peace Day’ to be proclaimed.  But now there is no peace and the Government offer has been withdrawn.  The Committee has been rather embarrassed.  To keep faith the demonstration was held on Monday and was very successful.  At 11 a.m. the children assembled at Market Square, from Burra, Baldina, World’s End, Thistlebeds, Leighton, Gum Creek, Hanson, Stony Gap and Copperhouse State Schools and from Miss Millar’s, Miss Bentley’s and St Joseph’s private schools – totalling almost 700 in all.  There were addresses by the Mayor, E.W. Crewes, Rev. Father Reddan and Rev. W.F. James.  They sang the National Anthem and then marched to Victoria Park where lunch was followed by sports.  There were refreshments a little before 4 p.m. and departure shortly after.
