Burra Electric Supply

R.H.M. Lea of ETSA will visit Burra on Thursday to discuss the connection of Burra to the ETSA supply.  For many years the Burra Electric Supply Co. has given good service with few interruptions to supply, but fuel and wages costs are rising and charges for electricity in Burra are high.  Compare charges for Burra and Waterloo (ETSA):

Burra	15d for first 10 units

12d for the next 15

8d for next 25

Then 6d and down to 4d for light or commercial use

Waterloo	10.9d per unit for a single meter for lights

3.25d per unit down to 1.775d for domestic power

3.4d down to 1.64d for commercial power
