Master Planning Options for Market Square and Best Place

Since the project commenced in early April consultation has been undertaken with local residents, traders, BRTBA and visitors.  Some points raised were:

The intersection is confusing and visitors occasionally travel in the wrong direction.

Too many differences in types of paving – some of which are slippery when wet.

Unsafe drains.

Lighting is poor in both power and design.

Public space is too disjointed, with too much bitumen.

There is inconsistency in the width of crossovers and many lack handrails.

Poor signage, and inconsistent in style.

The Post Office is an eyesore and doesn’t fit in the heritage core of the town.

Trucks backing into Landmark are disruptive/dangerous.

There is a lack of designated parking for caravans, coaches and 4WD vehicles.

There is a perception that the Council Car Park area is not open to the public.

Traders park in front of their shops.

There is a need for greater pedestrian safety in Commercial St.

The jinker should be more prominently displayed; either near the Mine entrance or in Market Square and should be better protected and lit.

The present jinker site would make a good coach parking bay.

Alfresco dining areas could be developed in Market Square.
