November 1847.  Mr Challoner was appointed junior clerk at the Mine with £100 p.a. and this like that of Captain Roach proved to be a wise appointment.  He remained almost to the end and was given the management after Captain Roach resigned and saw the Darlington Scheme introduced and sometime afterwards resigned and returned to England.  Captain Roach’s salary was increased.
