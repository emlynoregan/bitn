Burra Town Council, 1 December

New assessment to be advertised for tender in Burra, Clare and Kapunda papers only.

Mr M. Bednall advises a meeting of ratepayers is needed for a new loan for Victoria Park.

Resolved a meeting of ratepayers be called: left to the Mayor to arrange.

Mr Aldam is permitted to remove one tree from the street in front of his main door and the overseer is to lop the other at Mr Aldamâ€™s expense.

The mayor said he could not think of a suitable ground for emergency night landing of an aircraft in Burra as requested by the Safety Council.  The matter will stand over.

Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. have given a portion of block 13 for tennis courts [on the south side of Victoria Park] and the necessary action will be taken to effect the transfer.

CWA agrees with the signing of the agreement for renting two rooms in the Town Hall.

Aberdeen Tennis Club requested permission to play tennis on Sundays.  [See report on page 1.]

Dogs are causing damage to the Market Square garden.
