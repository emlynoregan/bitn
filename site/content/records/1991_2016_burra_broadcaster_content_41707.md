Burra Pony Club

A donation from Mr Jock Duncan has permitted a ceiling to be installed in the clubrooms, with insulation and Michael Condon and family have donated their old kitchen, which has now been installed.  Wayne Mitchell also donated a sink and bench top.  Macro Meats have donated a shipping container for storage and Adrian Gill donated time and equipment for electrical work to be completed.  The club has recently received a grant of $5,000 towards new storage facilities.
