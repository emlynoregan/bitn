Burra Burra Show Inc. held its AGM on 6 March in the Eastern Telephone Building.  The President paid tribute to the late James White as one of the best workers for the society – energetic, reliable and straight.  In the past year the society also lost two prominent members with the deaths of Sir John Melrose and C.A.S. Hawker MHR.  Sir John had paid to shift the sheds to the new showgrounds and had given £75 towards the building of Centenary Hall.

Elections saw the return of the same officers unopposed.

The Sheep Dog Trials on 22 & 23 April 1938 drew large entries.   Mr A.G. Drew lent the sheep.

The trees planted are doing well, but must be watered in their first year.

The Annual Show on 29 October was a great success.  Entries were well up to previous years.  During the year we entertained the New Zealand agricultural tourists.  We spent £61-8-0 on improvements – mostly on removing poultry coops and enlarging the shed over them and installing new pigeon coops.

The special railcar from Adelaide made a loss of £7-5-0 and maintenance costs were £13-7-2.

A large crowd made the trip to Sturt Vale last year and an invitation is extended this year for 3 April while Mr Codrington is there.

Various financial matters were discussed, especially concerning attempts to get relief from rates and taxes.  Elected were Patron, C. Bartholomaeus; President, I.J. Warnes; Vice Presidents, A.B. Riggs & S.H. Robinson and Secretary, M.S. Edwards.

The next show will be on Wednesday 25 October 1939.
