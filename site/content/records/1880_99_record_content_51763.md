The Mayor’s Report for 1893.

The total receipts for the year were £739-14-5 (the bank balance on 1 January was £17-16-5) and the bank balance is now £103-16-4.

The assessment last year was £9,577-1-9, but depreciating property values have brought it down to £9,442-1-9.

Interest has been reduced by £15 p.a. as £200 has been paid off the general account and £100 off the Parklands account.  The bonded Parklands debt has now been paid off, though an ordinary debt of £90 has been created.  In the next four years there is £800 of bonded debt to be paid off.

Only urgent work has been done in public works.

[The accounts show 1 lamp in North Ward cost £5-17-0.

1 lamp in East Ward cost £5-5-0

Lamps in West Ward cost £5-5-0.  In view of the costs this last should presumably be singular.]

1,000 trees have been planted in the town.  No. 2 Reserve in North Ward was planted at the expense of the Councillors for the ward.
