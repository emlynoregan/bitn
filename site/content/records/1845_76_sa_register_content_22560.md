John Meredith writes re the Redruth Church

An enquiry recently about the money raised several years ago for the Redruth Church now makes me ‘express my regret for not having sooner publicly testified my disapproval of the misappropriation of that money’.

As a contributor I say that if changed circumstances make it undesirable to continue with the project, I should, if a public meeting were called, vote for it to be invested as an endowment for the church in the district.  As I am leaving the colony I shall instruct my attorney to give his support to any plan to which other subscribers may agree upon to recover the money.
