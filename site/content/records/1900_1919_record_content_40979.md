Burra Institute Committee

The Finance Committee will look into a scheme for financing a billiard room.  A room for two tables would have to be 45’ x 20’ and would cost from £600 to £1,000.  The Institute is currently in credit £116-4-0.  Tenders will be called to place the lantern for picture shows in a fireproof condition.  There are 128 subscribers.  It was decided to call tenders for the new escape door.
