Burra Boy Scouts held their AGM in the Scout Hall Hanson on 12 March and elected: President, Rev. M. Edwards; Vice-President, Mr Ron. Gordon; Secretary, Mr Peter Mengersen and Treasurer, Bob Mason.

The year has been very successful.

On 8 August 1969 Mr Brian Ashdown was elected Group Scout Master at a Burra Town Hall Meeting.

Clare was visited on 15 August and a committee was then formed.

The disused Methodist Church and Church Hall at Hanson was chosen as the most suitable venue.

On 19 December 22 Scouts and 24 Cubs were invested.

Many thanks go for the assistance of Mr Maurice Davey, the District Commissioner.
