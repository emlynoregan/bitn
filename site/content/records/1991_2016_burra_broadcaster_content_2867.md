The New Swimming Pool is in its final stages of construction.  Due to the cost, the fencing, paving and landscaping have been withdrawn from the initial contract.  These tasks will need to be completed as soon as possible to enable the pool to be commissioned in early February and anyone who can assist should contact the committee.  (Chris Reed, Chairman.)
