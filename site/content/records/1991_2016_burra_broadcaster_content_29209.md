Tony Ryan, formerly of Burra, has been nominated for a place in the Australian Shearers’ Hall of Fame.  He is 79 and has shorn countless sheep.  He was one of the first to teach the Tally-Hi method of shearing in 1963, with the Australian Wool Board and was active in union affairs during his shearing days.  Twenty-five shearers have been nominated this year and five inducted since the Hall of Fame began last year.
