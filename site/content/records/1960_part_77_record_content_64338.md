‘Carols by the Pool’ was held in perfect weather on Sunday.  Rev. John Stephenson compered the evening.  Mrs Jack Oates provided the piano accompaniment and the Burra Methodist Choir led the singing. The Primary School children presented a Christmas tableau.

Mr Roy Jeffery as chairman of the District Council delivered his Christmas message, in which he paid a special tribute to those various local volunteer bodies who contribute so much to the well being of the community.  He also appealed for any ideas the public might have to solve the problem of lerp attacking gum trees along the Burra Creek.
