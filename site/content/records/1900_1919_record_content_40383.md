Mr Crewes thought they should consider a billiard room, especially if 6 oâ€™clock closing of hotels came in.  E.J. Davey said the early closing would not affect billiard rooms.  He could not support billiards which was surrounded by evil.  Mr Sommerville said the Terowie Institute billiard room was a great success and the idea seemed to gain general acceptance.
