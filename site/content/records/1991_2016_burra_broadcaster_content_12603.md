The National Bank held an evening at the Sports Complex last week with specialists from Adelaide attending to explain the banking products available locally.  The Burra branch of the National Australia Bank was the second one established outside of Adelaide, back in 1856[sic.].  [Photo of pharmacist John Barton with Joe Siragusa, NABâ€™s area manager.]
