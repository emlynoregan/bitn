Obituary.  Mrs Elizabeth W. Gubbins, of Thames St, Kooringa, died on 8 December.  She was the daughter of Thomas and Sophia Torr and was born in Tavistock, England on 5 November 1810.  She married there in 1831 and migrated to Adelaide in 1854, coming to Burra a few weeks later.  Mr Gubbins worked the mine and met with a fatal accident there on 13 August 1866.  She was the oldest resident lady in Burra.  The late John Torr of Redruth and James Torr of Mintaro were her brothers.  She leaves two daughters: Mrs W.H. Turner of Brompton and Mrs J.T. Pryor of Broken Hill and one son, Mr James Gubbins of Broken Hill.  Alderman J. Gubbins of Broken Hill has spent a few days in Burra owing to his motherâ€™s death and has met a number of old friends.  His conversation was versatile, intelligent and edifying.  There are 24 grandchildren and 20 great-grandchildren.  Rev. W.G. Clarke officiated at the grave with a memorial service in the evening at the Methodist Church.  The deceased had been a member of the Bible Christian church for many years.
