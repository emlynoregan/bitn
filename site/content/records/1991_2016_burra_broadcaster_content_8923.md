Council Amalgamations

The politics of council amalgamations continue.  Burraâ€™s District Clerk Steve Kerrigan said they were waiting for confirmation of the recent legislation and the role of the reform board, before entering into further discussions with other councils in the region.

Kooringa CoHousing will make a further attempt to avoid a court hearing over the use of composting toilets at their development in Allen Street.  They will ask for Council to reconsider the issue on 18 December.  A planning Commissioner has already suggested a compromise in which seven units are trialled in the first stage.
