Burra Town Council, Special Meeting 4 May.

The memorials about the Bon Accord Bridge are ready and the Mayor has been voted as a deputation to take the same to the Treasurer.

Ordinary Meeting, 18 May.

The lamp at Henderson’s Bridge is in the course of construction.

Bagot, Shakes & Lewis reply to the council’s letter about settling the drainage problem and though willing to settle amicably they want to quibble over details - they want the drain pitch-paved every chain instead of every half chain and for the paving to be 3’ wide rather than 8’ and that the road at the corner of the brewery should be made by the Council and that it should be on the south side of the street.

Cr Sampson said he had seen Mr Lewis and there was no valid reason for the south side.

Cr Rabbich - And what about Mr Lockyer?  The south side would block him out.

Cr Sampson said he thought agreement was as far off as ever and if no understanding was come to at once they might as well clear the obstruction and let the water take its course.  The offer had been made to Mr Lewis and if it was not accepted the creek should be cleared out.

Cr Watt thought they might accept Mr Lewis’s offer.

Cr Sampson demurred.

Cr Rabbich objected to the south side as it would interfere with Mr Lockyer.

Cr Sampson would yield on the every chain instead of half chain, but wanted the paving of the street corner done properly.

Cr Rabbich wanted suspension of standing orders to reconsider the issue with Bagot, Shakes & Lewis.

Cr Sampson refused and moved that if Mr Lewis is prepared to pitch pave at every chain 6’, 8’ and 10’ at the end [Meaning unclear], the work to be commenced at once, he would support it.

After some confusing discussion Cr Rabbich moved that consideration of the correspondence re the drain from Bagot, Shakes & Lewis be adjourned and this was carried.
