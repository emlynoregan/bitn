Member for Custance Mr Ivan Venning has written to the Minister following a recent Prime Ministerial announcement of $2 billion to be spent on roads.  He is keen to see some of it spent on the Morgan-Burra-Spalding Road, but also on a number of other roads in the region.  He says we are often travelling on typical 1950s roads trying to meet the demands of the 1990s traffic.
