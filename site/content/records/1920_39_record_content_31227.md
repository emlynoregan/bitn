Frank Treloar: Looking Back (Continued)

The Burra Mine reached its height in production in 1860 after which production shrank.  The water shaft (Morphett’s) could only maintain a water level and work had to be confined to land above that.  Some economies were possible and savings of £10,000 p.a. were identified.  To work to a depth of 50 fathoms the engine had to work continuously with 5,000 tons of wood p.a. plus wages.  The extension of the railway to Kapunda in the late 1850s enabled some savings.  For the workers it was fortunate that as Burra began to fade discoveries of copper were made at Kadina and soon after at Moonta and over the ensuing years hundreds left Burra for Yoke Peninsula.

Logs for underground timbering got scarcer and dearer – increasing to 22/6 per ton and sawn logs to 24/9.  In February 1862 W. Woollacott and John Thomas undertook to supply 4,000 tons of wood at 500 tons per month at 11/3 green and 13/3 dry.  Later in the year the prices rose to 12/6 green and 14/6 dry.  In 1861 hay reached £5 a ton.  In 1861 11, 470 tons of ore were raised, down 2,400 tons: the assay value remained at over 20%.  In 1864 an untreatable cattle disease (pleuro-pneumonia) killed working bullocks and milch cows.  Men with three teams were reduced to one, two teams to part of one and men with one team were wiped out.  Horse teams largely took their place as a result.  By September 1864 incoming supplies of wood were only half the amount needed and the reserves were largely exhausted.  The mine got down to between 600 & 700 tons.  Prices rose, but the lack of bullocks forced arrangements to be made to mix coal from the Copper Co. with the wood.  Underground timber needs also ran into trouble.  The directors had to seriously consider allowing the mines to be flooded.  In January hay had been £2-15-0 a ton, but by December it was £4-10-0 and in February 1865 £6.  By November 1865 it cost £7-10-0 a ton for 26 tons obtained from Clare and by May 1866 the price hit £10 a ton.  1865-66 were years of the ‘Big Drought’.  Ore raised continued to fall:	1862	9,490 tons

1863	8,819

1864	7,432

1865	6,393

1866	5,772 representing a fall of 8,090 tons in six years.

In October 1866 there was an order from Adelaide to inspect all of SAMA’s assets including the smelting works and for a careful report to be sent to the city.  With hindsight this looks like preparation for a possible closure.

The probability that good ore lay at lower depths caused the directors to consider helping Morphett’s Shaft and work on a new shaft, later known as Graves’ was begun.  It was in hard rock and proved expensive.  Soon it was costing £55 to £65 a fathom to dig and by 50 fathoms it was costing £70 a fathom.  The shaft was beautifully timbered and them Thomas Paynton and Ambrose Harris set about building the engine house.
