Obituary & Inquest.  The body of John Shepherdson aged 65 was found dead in a paddock at Hillside c. 2½ miles north of Burra by Messrs Charles and August Fuss while on a sporting excursion on 9 August.  The inquest was held at the Redruth Court House 10 August with W.R. Ridgway JP as coroner.

C. Fuss:

Came across the body about 4 o’clock.  From appearances the body might have been there about a week.  Lying on stomach with left arm underneath.  No signs of a struggle.  Did not know deceased.  There was a crutch about two feet from the body.  Informed police as soon as possible.  We were out hunting when we found the body about half a mile from the main road.

Miss Birkett, Matron of the Burra Hospital:

Could say the deceased was John Shepherdson, a patient from 28 May to 16 July.  When leaving hospital he probably had c. 20/- in his pocket and said he had a job on a station as a cook.  Sometimes complained of pains in the head.  I did not believe the job story.  He was a cripple without friends in SA.  In hospital he had a bottle ¾ full of laudanum, which he said had been advised by a doctor.

William Brown, in the employ of Mr Austin, butcher of Aberdeen:

Had seen the man on Wednesday 1 August.  He was walking with a crutch up the road towards Hallett.

Dr Brummitt:

Identified the deceased as a patient from the hospital.  He had had violent headaches for some months.  Probably suffered from some brain disease.  Expect that death was from that cause.  He had been a sensitive person who hated to be thought a loafer.

Trooper Williams:

The death was reported yesterday by Mr August Fuss.  Went to the place accompanied by the Fuss Brothers and Trooper Eaton.  [He gave the same description of the body as C. Fuss above.]  Deceased had stayed at Bromley’s Eating House for one night after leaving hospital.

The Jury: Deceased came to his death from brain disease and exposure.
