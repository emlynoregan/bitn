Obituary.  Mr W.P. Long died at Hill Farm, Skilly (Auburn).  He came to SA in 1849 and went first to Burra where he was among the first lot of teamsters to cart ore from the Burra Mine.  [If he came in 1849 he would not have been among the first, as the mine started in 1845.]  Later he went to Auburn and took land at Skilly, where he resided for c. 50 years.  He had been a Councillor for Upper Wakefield DC and was connected with the Northern Agricultural Society.

[William Poole Long died 18 September 1901 aged 73]
