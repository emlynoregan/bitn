Henry Pinch.  There are few residents better able to tell tales of the past as far as Burra is concerned than Mr Henry Pinch.  He has been a resident for a very long time, and was among the first, if not actually the first, buyer of allotments in Aberdeen in the early days.  [The reference should here be to Redruth.]  He is now 78 years of age, while his better half is his senior by about ten years, and of the two Mr Pinch enjoys the best of health.  Mrs Pinch has been ill for some time, and a father time does his work her condition is getting more serious, and she cannot be left alone.  ‘Harry’ as he is familiarly called, served his time as a blacksmith in the old country, but when he came to SA he failed to get employment at the trade and so put in 20 years as a miner at the Burra Mine.  He has lived a retired life for some time.
