Letter from H.C. Young writes expressing surprise at seeing himself mentioned as a leader in the bread throwing larrikinism and denying same - though he is willing to admit being present and doing ‘what a good many more did’.  He also considers that it is a bit tough to write as if the larrikinism was the cause of the current depression.
