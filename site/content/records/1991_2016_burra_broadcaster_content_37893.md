Burra Kindergarten organised a Food & Wine night at the Brewery Cellars last Friday night.  More than 130 attended an event well supported by sponsorship from the five Burra Hotels, Mt Bryan Hotel, BP Garage, Oppyâ€™s IGA, Burra Pharmacy, Burra Creek Wines and Maggie, Colin & Saskia Beer.  The evening raised c. $4,000, which will go towards paying for the $8,000 bike track installed recently at the kindergarten.
