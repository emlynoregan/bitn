Burra Town Council, Monday.

Council will go into the expenditure and receipts on Victoria Park.  The oval is in a deplorable condition.  It will be inspected and discussed at the next meeting.

The ford across the creek in George St has been completed.  [The ‘Pig and Whistle’ crossing.]

Various minor works were approved.

Mr H. R. Bosisto attended and explained his proposal for a town pound in Ayers St next to Wood’s place.  Cr Kellaway said it was too close to people’s homes.  It was resolved not to proceed with a pound.
