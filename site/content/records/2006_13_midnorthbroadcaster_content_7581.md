Goyder Council met at Burra on 7 April and discussed a range of topics, but the Eudunda Sporting Complex dominated the meeting.  In particular the information package developed for Eudunda electors was carefully scrutinised and modified as necessary.  The document had been assembled to the best of their ability by the ECBaT team.  It was stated that a more profession presentation could have been prepared if ECBaT still had access to the services of the consultant, who the Council let go recently.
