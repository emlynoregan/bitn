Arbor Day at Burra Schools was held last Friday.  The opportunity was taken to fill in the air raid trenches at the school.  Mr Tom Rice, Head Teacher, intends to plant suitable trees on the sites.  The avenue of Currajongs leading to the school is growing well.  Addresses were given by Rev. Barrett & F.T. Marston before a half holiday.

Ted Woodman AIF is home on leave.

Jim Terry RAAF has returned to his unit.

Roy Kuchenmeister has been on leave in Burra.

Lieut. & Mrs Bob Crewes have returned to Burra after a considerable absence and hope to take up residence in the district soon.

Capt. Phil McBride, son of Mr & Mrs P.A. McBride, visited Burra at the weekend.

Burra Town Council, 2 October

The Masonic Lodge was granted the use of the Council Chamber on the night of the Installation Ball, for the convenience of distinguished guests.

The Ministers Fraternal sought some Council finance towards the cost of a Thanksgiving Service when hostilities in Europe cease.  The Mayor thought this was premature.
