Kooringa News, 23 March

Professor Belew gave a lesson in horse-taming on Saturday 18 March to about 20 gentlemen in the bowling alley of the Pig & Whistle Hotel.  The horse was an unbroken one from World’s End Run.  The Professor succeeded in completely taming it so that several of those present could mount it.

Professor Bushell gave a second electro-biological entertainment at the Burra Hotel on Saturday.  The performance was much the same as his first.

Trade is slack and many of the best and steadiest miners continue to leave for Wallaroo.
