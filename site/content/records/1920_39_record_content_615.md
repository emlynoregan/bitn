Capt. & Mrs A.L. Killicoat arrived on the Megantic on Wednesday.  Captain Killicoat has been absent from Australia for nine years.  He is the 2nd son of the late P.L. Killicoat of Burra and Mrs Killicoat, now of St Peters.  He undertook engineering at James Martin & Co. of Gawler and then at Broken Hill and finally at shipbuilding docks at Greenock in Scotland.  He enlisted in Lovat’s Scouts and later served in the 1st Royal Scots and saw service in Mesopotamia and Egypt, rising from private to captain on the field.  His friend Jock Hutchison whom he met at Broken Hill accompanied him to Scotland and was killed early in the war.  Captain Killicoat recently married Hutchison’s sister and she returned to Australia with him.  She is the daughter of a wealthy Scottish contractor.
