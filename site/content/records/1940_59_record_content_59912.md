Accident/Obituary.  Andrew (Gus) [Ross] Kakoschke (13) of Burra North was fatally injured in the old Ballast Quarry at Burra North on Saturday afternoon when struck on the head by a falling stone.  Constable Barbary and Stan Irlam found the lad unconscious and bleeding from the head.  He was taken to Burra Hospital and treated for a compound fracture of the skull.  He died on Sunday morning [26 July.] Nine lads aged 8-13 had been playing cops and robbers and when they reached the north end of the cut they climbed its face.  At the top one lad placed a large stone on the edge and the earth gave way.  It bounced down the face taking other stones with it.  They crashed around Andrew and one of them hit his head.  The drop was about 60 ft.  [See funeral note: 81, 30, 4 Aug. 1953, page 1.]
