The March meeting was attended by 50 ladies to hear an address by Matron G. Siegele.  She was Matron at the Burra Hospital 1923-37.  During that time she went to Sydney to study the Truby King Baby Nursing Methods and on her return established the first Infant Health Clinic in Burra.  After leaving Burra she went to Port Pirie and Broken Hill, before going to Royal Perth Hospital, where she spent 19 years before retiring 12 years ago.  At the age of 80 she is an active worker for her church and a member of the Embroidery Guild in Adelaide.  While here she visited the Hospital and Barker’s Cottages, where she knew several of the residents.  She had lunch with Mrs Roy Jeffery, who also drove her around the town and Mine area before she returned to the city.
