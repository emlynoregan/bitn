Football.  On Saturday a match was played between Aberdeen and Kooringa, during which Jimmy Murphy suffered a broken nose.  Aberdeen 7.3 defeated Kooringa 5.5.

‘The game throughout was exceedingly rough, numerous marks being given for rough play.  Three players had to go to the doctor after the game.  The language used by some of the members will bear a good deal of improvement, and it is to be hoped that it will be modified during the next game.’
