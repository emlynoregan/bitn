2nd Leader on the Burra Hospital.

The figures just released show it to be conducted on more economic terms than any other similar institution in SA.  In the last 12 months 912 were treated and 52 died and of those, half were from accidents.  A patient is fed, nursed and receives medical attendance for just over £1 a week.  In 1894 only £152 was received from patients.  £148-0-7 came from subscriptions and £1,478-0-11 from Government subsidy.  The daily occupancy for three years has averaged 33.
