Cr Bevan said the proprietor of the factory had advised him that the piping to carry the used water across the creek had arrived and the work of erecting it would be carried out promptly.    When he could get permission to do so he would erect a shed over the factory yard and install a high chimney stack to get rid of the smoke nuisance.

Cr Kellaway said if the proprietor had committed any sin, it had been condoned by the Board.

Cr Harvey said the Board had never given permission for many things done at the factory and many had been done in defiance of the Board.  The Clerk said no licence had been issued for the curing of bacon.

Cr Carpenter said there was nothing wrong with washing pigs’ heads at the factory – the same things would be done in the manufacture of small goods.  The whole problem was that the orders of the Board were not being carried out.  He thought Cr Harvey’s motion was too extreme.  The Board should give the owner a chance to carry on and if the smell remained further action would have to be taken.

The Mayor said the proprietor would not be able to get permission to make additions to the building.  Cr Carpenter said there had been some suggestion of moving the factory to Drew & Crewes’ old store at Burra North, but that would merely shift the smell.

The motion to rescind Cr Harvey’s motion was lost on the casting vote of the Mayor.

Cr Carpenter gave notice that at the next meeting of the Board he would ask if this Board of Health had power to issue a licence to the owner of the Bacon Factory to manufacture.  He had a slaughter licence for the slaughter yards.

Editor: We have now been given to understand that the Local Board of health has no power to issue a licence for the curing or manufacture of bacon and that the Commonwealth Licence is the only one which it is necessary for the owner of the factory to possess.
