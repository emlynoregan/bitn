Burra Hospital Bowls Tournament

72 bowlers took part last Sunday despite the cold and wintry conditions.  After a play-off Frank Matthewsâ€™ rink came out winners with Ron Gordon, Vi Allen & Geoff Male.  The runners-up were skippered by Ken Williams with Tom McWaters, Hilda Earle and Darcy Tiver.  The result of the tournament was $500, which with Government subsidy will be worth $1,000 for the Burra Hospital.
