Burra Town Council

Sympathy extended to Cr Lane on his bereavement.

Cr Parks drew attention to land owned by J. Griffiths on the way to the underway of the railway line, Redruth. [Aberdeen?]  If fenced it would interfere with the road.  He was prepared to sell it for a small sum to Council and it would be better to buy it than make a new road.  The Overseer said he would have to measure it.  It ran in a line with Mr Reed’s property and West Tce.  Overseer to measure and Council to inspect.

Letter from E.W. Crewes re Glover Family Relief Fund.  After paying all Aberdeen liabilities the Aberdeen people had in reserve £12-15-1.  After paying all Kooringa liabilities the Kooringa people had in reserve £18-13-5.  Consequently £31-8-6 was handed over to Mr & Mrs Glover on Friday last.

Letter from E.W. Crewes urging all able-bodied men to turn up for the meeting to form a Volunteer Rifle Co.
