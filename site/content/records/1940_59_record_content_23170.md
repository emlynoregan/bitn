RSL Appeal Fund has reached £1,772-12-0, leaving £747-8-0 to go to reach the target of £2,500.

Burra Town Council, 17 September

The Burra Electric Supply Co. Secretary said it was hard to give an estimated cost for floodlighting Market Square without knowing how many lights were desired.  He undertook to meet with Councillors and demonstrate with one floodlight.

Mr A.E. Smith MHR wrote to say he was taking up the matter of Sgt E.R. Davey’s release with the Minister of Labour and National Service.

State Bank advised that a payment of £31-12-5 was due on the Institute loan on 30 September.

The [SA] National Gallery forwarded an enlarged photograph of Ex-Mayor, the late Dr Brummitt.

Cr Bevan said an Adelaide firm was offering a 15 Watt Public Address System that had been used for demonstration purposes, for £55 as against £79 for a new machine.

Cr Jennison said such an amplifier would be too large if it was to be used only in the hall.

It was decided to let the matter lie on the table for future reference.

Burra Centenary Speed and Cycle Sports were receiving a lot of interest from speedmen in Adelaide and elsewhere.

Aberdeen Croquet Club held its AGM 12 September.

Elected: President, Miss Bartholomaeus; Vice-President, Mrs E. Steer; Secretary, Mrs W.H. Gare; Treasurer, Miss Bartholomaeus and Captain, Mrs R.E. Davey.

It was decided to open the lawns on 16 October.

Cpl C.L. Earle, who was taken prisoner of war by the Japanese at Singapore, has cabled his brother, Mr Roy Earle of Leighton, to say he is well and hopes to be returning to Australia soon.
