Cr Kellaway said there was no need to bring Sunday tennis into it at all.  The business before them was whether the Council will or will not allow the club to purchase the property.  He believed Â£600 had been spent, but he was a bit dubious as to whether the purchase was the wish of the majority of the club and the deputation had not stated that as a fact.
