Burra Rifle Club.  The 10th stage of the Baldina Trophy had to be abandoned when the wind blew a gale and the dust could barely be seen through.  At the same time the Christmas Shoot was being held and with its shorter distance was completed with some difficulty over 200 & 300 yards.  The best scores were by J.E. Pearce, N. Villis & E.C. Collins.  J.E. Pearceâ€™s two scores of 47 over each range were remarkable in the conditions.
