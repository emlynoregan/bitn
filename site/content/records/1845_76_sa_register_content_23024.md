[This article does not mention Burra specifically, but it gives an overview of the state of SA Education and outlines some of the reasons that contributed to the changes made in the 1870s.  The writer gives census data to conclude that SA should have between 30,000 and 35,000 children at school.  The actual total shown in the returns is 20,846.  Thus less than two thirds of those of educable age are enrolled.  Actual attendance is yet lower; only 17,866.  And of this figure 1,626 are under the age of five and 523 are over the age of 15 and so outside the measured number of educable age.  This means barely 15,000 of those of educable age are actually attending school.  What of the quality of education?  One can assume that good organisation of schools and a staff of decently paid teachers would be necessary.  There are 527 schools and 1,013 teachers provided for 17,866 scholars, giving an average of 34 scholars per school and 17 per teacher.  If each child pays £3 per annum, including the Government grant, the average income per school would be £102 and per teacher £51.  Good scholars cannot be maintained on such a footing.  The figure of £51 is only half the earnings of mechanical labour.  The writer concludes after further discussion that perhaps 10,000 receive a fair elementary education, but no more than 500 to 600 get anything like a higher education.]
