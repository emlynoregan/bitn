Obituary.  Mrs A. Lott of Kooringa died on 19 September.  She had been a resident of over 58 years.  She was born at Chatham, England, on 27 December 1861.  She was a daughter of Captain Joseph W. Hodge and Mrs Hodge of the Third Light Dragoons.  In 1864 her father was sent to WA in charge of 600 convicts on the Clara.  He had served in the Crimean and Indian Wars.  His wife and three children accompanied him.  They settled in WA.  At the age of 21 Miss [Amelia] Hodge came to SA and became a nurse at the Burra Hospital.  She later married Mr A. Lott of Kooringa.  She was a staunch adherent and member of St Mary’s and a worker for patriotic causes in the Great War.  A family of five survive: Major A.W. Lott (2 I.T.D. Wayville), Mrs L.S. Penrose (Aldgate), Sister Clara Lott (Burra), Mrs D. Murdock (Crystal Brook) & Mr R. Clifton Lott (Burra).  There are 13 grandchildren.
