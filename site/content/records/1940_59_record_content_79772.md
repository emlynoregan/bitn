Burra Town Council, 2 December

A letter is to be written to H.C. Davies concerning the poor state of the old Eastern Telephone Building.  Iron blowing off the roof posed a danger.

Burra Hospital has arranged for a deputation to wait upon the Minister of Works Mr McIntosh tomorrow regarding the Murray water for the Burra Hospital.  Murray water is required for the new hot water system recently installed.

Dalgety’s off-shears sale on 29 November cleared 8,788 sheep of the 11,756 offered.

Constable Brian Dowling who has been at Hallett for four years has been transferred to Pt Wakefield and will leave on 17 December.

Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. & Elder, Smith & Co.’s combined Burra Markets attracted little interest last Friday and of 10,474 sheep offered only 4,579 were sold.
