Letter from ‘L.A.M.’ again, attacking ‘Fairplay’ and asking whether the latter would care to go to Oodnadatta, work under the conditions for the amount on offer and try to support his family on what is left.

‘He would come creeping back like a whipped puppy with his tail down, not even heart enough to carry his swag.’

‘Fairplay says it’s the workers’ fault they are so badly off now because they waste what they earn.’

This terrible drought is enough to cripple nearly all the industries . . .

W.T. Truscott writes to dent emphatically that he is ‘Fairplay’.
