Bon Accord Mining Co.

The shares in this company have just been allotted, despite the tightness in the money market.  A change has been made in the method of payment by which the company will acquire the property.  The price originally agreed upon by the joint owners: The Scottish Australian Investment and North British Australasian Companies, was £24,000 cash and a royalty of one twentieth of all ore to be raised.  It has now been agreed that, subject to the agreement of the proprietaries of the two old companies, that the prices shall be £18,000 and 12,000 shares with 10/- per share paid up, in the Bon Accord Copper Mining Company, together with the one-twentieth royalty.  In this way the Scottish Australian Investment Company will receive £12,000 cash and 8,000 shares and the North British Australasian Company will receive £6,000 cash and 4,000 shares, together with their share of the one twentieth royalty.  We understand the remaining 75,000 shares, of which the capital of the Company consists, are held by an excellent proprietary of between 600 and 700 shareholders.  Should the continuation of the Burra Burra ores be found without much difficulty this arrangement should be most favourable to both the old companies and the new one that has undertaken its development.  The proprietors of the Scottish Australian Investment Company have decided to accept this proposed arrangement.

The Scottish Australian Investment Company

[This is a very long report on a special general meeting of the company, held in London and reported in the Mining Journal of 25 April.]

[A few points of interest from this long report:

62,250 shares in the new Bon Accord Mining Co. were taken up by the public.  The Scottish Australian Investment Company was allocated 8,000 and the North British Australasian Company got 4,000 under the arrangement for the sale of the Bon Accord property.  This, when 500 were allocated to the Manager in Australia and 250 to the Sub-manager, accounted for all the 75,000 shares.

The Chairman quotes a letter from un-named Australians who had been negotiating to lease the unsold portion of the Bon Accord property with the intention to develop the mine.  They say that they have watched the whole operation of the mine and are confident that they have a better idea of where the lode will lie.  They were negotiating with Mr Morehead of Sydney and briefly with Mr Elder of Adelaide before returning to Mr Moorhead.  They concluded that no one in Australia had the authority to lease them the property and so they were turning to the principals in the UK.

The Chairman also quotes a letter of July 1856 in which there is mention of a discovery of a lode of malachite in the 40 fathom level of the Burra Burra Mine, which passes right into the Bon Accord property.  This gives great encouragement to the prospects of the Bon Accord Mine.

The Chairman then proposed acceptance of the arrangements outlined in the previous article.

There was some dissent with one shareholder arguing for a leasing arrangement and another wanting the shares being allotted to them to be fully paid rather than paid to 10/-.  This shareholder (Mr Ward) also asked if there was any truth to a report that Burra Burra miners had crossed the line into Bon Accord property in their operations.

J.N. Smith, a Director, pointed out that the cost on their books of the Bon Accord was between £8,000 and £9,000 and they were going to get £12,000 and 8,000 shares paid to 10/- and a royalty.  They could not lose on the deal.

The proposition to accept the offer was carried with applause, with two dissentients.
