Cr Lee said a similar motion had been made long ago and there had been ample time to inspect the bridge.

Cr Carpenter said it had been inspected and the estimate of £22-10-0 for repair had been submitted by the Overseer.  The bridge was in a bad state.  Amendment lost and motion carried.

[This report is confusing, with the bridge being at once beyond repair and yet to be repaired.  The sum of £22-10-0 seems remarkably modest for a new bridge, but it is also not clear whether they are considering the road bridge or the footbridge.  Sometimes Lewis’s Bridge refers to the one in Commercial St, but this would involve the Highways Department, so it must be a bridge in Kangaroo St.]
