Burra Town Hall

The CWA ladies want to see improved supper facilities at the hall and recently they donated Â£30 for a new stainless sink and drainage board to be installed in the present supper room.  They believe a new supper room should be built at the rear of the present building.  Also there was a suggestion that the library be used for suppers and a new library be built.  Council will meet with the CWA for discussions.
