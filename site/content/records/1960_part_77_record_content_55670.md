European Carp.  Reports have confirmed the spread of European Carp throughout the River Murray in SA.

Football.  In a pre-season game at Loxton Burra Footballers lost both the ‘A’ & ‘B’ Grade matches.

Ron Wuttke was farewelled by the RSL on Friday night. He had been an active member of the RSL here for 20 years.  He was formerly manager of Dalgety’s at Burra and has been transferred to Pt Augusta.

Burra Railway Station acquired a new ‘track-placer’ on Thursday.  This will enable shunting of loads of up to 180 tons.  Engines from goods trains had previously done this work and the change will reduce travel times for goods trains as a result.  Transfer of single trucks has long been done by a Loco Pulser, which has a single rubber tyred wheel driven by a JAP motor and is believed to be the last one in SA.  It has now been returned to Adelaide.

The Track-Placer is essentially a tractor with hydraulic hoist and a turntable attached underneath, a railway track coupling hydraulically operated at the front and back and a small pair of ‘railway’ wheels front and back, also hydraulically operated.  It can be used for normal road travelling and be driven up to the railway line at right angles, the hoist lowered to the ground and the vehicle raised and swung into position along the track.  The railway wheels are then lowered onto the line, the hoist raised and the Track-Placer is ready to do shunting.  The hydraulic coupling is raised to lift the front of the railway truck, placing sufficient weight on the front wheels of the Track-Placer to provide traction.  The rear wheels of the tractor will be raised above the railway line during shunting.

Fifty-two regular trains pass through Burra each week.  The office/control room at the station will undergo complete renewal in the next few weeks due to the white ant damage to flooring and cupboards.
