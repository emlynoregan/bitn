Burra Town Council, 1 March

Commander HMAS Burra-Bra wrote saying the ship had been named after Burra and that other towns with ships named after them had supplied plaques giving the reason for the name of the ship.  Though patriotic organisations cannot raise money for a separate body, they will be notified of the situation.

Various road works and drainage matters were approved.

Cr Marston said the blackout covers on streetlights should be removed and a number of streetlights were not burning.

The Town Clerk said the Electric Supply Co. informed him that the blackout regulations still applied.

Cr Marston said other towns seem not to be compelled to observe them.

The Company is to be asked that the lights be put in order.

Button Day for the Merchant Navy raised Â£15. [This is the probable meaning of corrupt text.]
