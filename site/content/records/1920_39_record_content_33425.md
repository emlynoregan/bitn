Burra Town Council, 3 February

Cr Morgan reported that having inspected two horses on offer to the Council both were so good that they decided to buy both and the Overseer had tried them out and agreed.

The Council’s grey horse was now 21 and horses of that type were no longer bred in great numbers.  The action was endorsed.

Local Government Dept. is unable to accede to a request for a special grant to cover recent flood damage.

There was discussion about how best to get the most economical work from the Town Clerk now that he had to be a full-time officer.

Cr Pearce said if he was a full-time Town Clerk they would have to appoint other officers for inspector and ranger.

Cr Woollacott thought that if they gave him £36 extra and let him have the same hours as before and to do all his outside work it would not be legal.

The Mayor disagreed.

Cr Woollacott felt it unfair that they were paying a full-time salary for two days work a week.

In the end the town Clerk’s duties were laid down as in the past.

The rate was moved by Cr Allen to be 2/6 instead of 2/9.

The Mayor said it would reduce the rate income by £315 and if carried the Town Clerk would not be a full-time officer next year.  Carried.

Cr Pearce moved that ward allocations of funds by 4/14 for North Ward, 6/14 for East Ward and 4/14 for West Ward (out of £1,148).

Last year’s allocations based on length of road and footpaths he deemed unfair, as among other objections it failed to take into account East Ward’s numerous bridges.  In the last two years actual amounts spent had been East Ward £651, North Ward £663 and West Ward £520, while the actual rates collected were East Ward £1,866, North Ward £1,319 and West Ward £1,389.  North Ward had also had a local road put in order from the Main Road funds – at not less than £275.

[Presumably because of recent changes to the main roads schedule.]

North Ward had more than its fair share in the last four years.

Cr Woollacott moved as an amendment that the question of allocations be referred back to the Finance Committee.  He countered Cr Pearce’s arguments with ones that North Ward had greater lengths of local roads which are used by everyone, whereas East Ward has only the cemetery road of that sort.  Also they had roads on hills that were cut out every rain.  Further North Ward funds had been used to help pay for bridges near W. Geake’s & W. Finch’s and the ford at the Pig & Whistle.  The Mayor said no to the ford.

Cr Morgan supported Cr Woollacott and said North Ward’s roads were the worst in the town.

The Mayor said last year the allocation worked out at 5/14 for West Ward, 5/14 for East Ward and 4/14 for North Ward.  The current proposal gave East Ward an extra 1/14.  The amendment was lost.

Ayers St Bridge is being repaired.  (Its walls are being attended to.)

The RSL will have a regular article in the paper.  The AGM is due on 7 March.
