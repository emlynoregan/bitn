Kooringa News

A meeting of the principal storekeepers was held recently to consider the propriety of closing their stores earlier than they had been accustomed to.  It was resolved that for the winter months they would close at 7 p.m.  There being no town clock or other means of ascertaining the time, it was decided that a blunderbuss should be fired at the proper hour and this has been done regularly of late.
