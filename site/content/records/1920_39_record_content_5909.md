Burra Football Association

Final meeting for the year 31 October.  The Association was in credit £34-1-9.  Various accounts were paid, mainly associated with the final at Farrell’s Flat.  The secretary’s honorarium of £10-10-0 was voted to E.J. Davey.  £5 was voted to each of the 3 remaining clubs in the Association, as membership next year was quite uncertain.  Remaining balance is now £2.
