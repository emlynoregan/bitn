Obituary.  Edward Anthony Moore aged 84, late of Burra, died at the residence of his daughter, Mrs Ann [Angeline] Turnbull of Norwood, 21 August.    Mr Moore lived in Burra for most of his life.  His wife, Bessie, died some years ago.  He leaves 9 daughters and 4 sons, several grandchildren and great-grandchildren.  [Death CD gives age at death as 73, but this must be in error.  Marriage CD suggests a birth in 1869, but the age cited above favours 1866.  The birth seems not to be on SA Births CD.]
