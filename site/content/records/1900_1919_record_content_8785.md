Rev. W.H. Rofe of Adelaide officiated.  The Service of Song was Davey’s Sacrifice.  There was a picnic at Sod Hut in Mr Sandland’s paddock, which passed off well despite the wind, dust, thunder and lightning.  The public meeting was held on Wednesday.  Sunday school numbers are down from 173 to 167 due to removals.  Supper was taken in Jubilee Hall.
