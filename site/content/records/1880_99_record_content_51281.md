There was some dissention about the Mayor’s wish to nominate the five, but eventually his nomination of Dr Brummitt, and Messrs E.C. Lockyer, P.L. Killicoat, T.W. Wilkinson and P. Lane was agreed to and they accepted.  Cr Parks 2nd.

In his remarks he accused the Record reports of being one-sided, which caused uproar.  He considered his actions in the Council were suppressed by the editor.  He brought up the question of the stinking fish in the creek when the writer of the Record inferred that what he had said was false.’

Cr Linkson said he was not connected with the Burra Record and had always done the business of the town in the Council Chamber and was much against it being done in committee.  He and Councillor Walsh had objected to going into committee even on 15 August when not one ratepayer, not even the editor of The Record was present.  They had not been elected to deal with personal grievances.

Cr Hardy had first moved to go into committee under Section 96 and when it was pointed out this was illegal Cr Parks moved at the next meeting the same under Section 33.  He had advice that the meeting of 12 September was illegal and as this meeting passed the town assessment it was a serious matter.

Cr Hardy ascended the platform amid confusion and said: ‘I don’t deny that there is a lot of spite attached to this affair.

(A Voice: You admit the truth for once then.  Uproar and dissent.)’

The Chair ruled any discussion of spite out of order.

He claimed the Record held gross misrepresentations but he would not go into them.  In Mr Holder’s time meetings were not reported as they are now.  There had been 22 letters published in the Record and all for the other side.

Asked to withdraw his motion Mr Sampson said, ‘The vital question is whether the business of the town will be conducted with open or closed doors?’

‘Cr Parks (promptly replying) It will be open Council.’
