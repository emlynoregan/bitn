‘Surprise’ writes from Redruth 9 April.

I was surprised at the Mine stoppage, having always thought of the Directors as men gifted with more than the ordinary amount of talent.  Many are saying the move is but part of a process that will yet astonish the world.  If the object is to lower wages it looks like burning the house down to heat the oven.  If the object is to sell the mine, everyone knows that selling a ‘knocked bal’ is like trying to sell a dead dog.

[He goes on to consider that in Cornwall if a mine needed money for exploration when conditions were bad than a call would be made on the shareholders, but it seems different here.]

It is also very hard that as well as losing their jobs the miners should lose all the investment they have made in building homes, which are the company’s asset.  It is a serious thing for the colony to throw hundreds of men out of work, to destroy their years of savings and make property valueless that was worth thousands.
