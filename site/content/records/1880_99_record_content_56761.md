The new By-Law.

Cr Hardy moved the old by-law be rescinded and replaced by the one read last meeting.

Cr Harris 2nd.

Cr Sampson opposed it as iniquitous, unfair and not asked for.  He outlined his objections along now familiar lines.

Cr Rabbich cut off the speech by moving the house divide.  Not 2nd.

But the Mayor put the original motion.

For: Hardy, Harris, Parks and Rabbich.

Opposed: Sampson & West.

Cr Rabbich moved the by-law be printed.

Cr Sampson gave notice he would move at the next Council for a call of Council to rescind the minute of 17 December 1894, which gave all printing for 1895 to the News office.

[He favoured sending it to tender.]
