Burra Town Council, 21 May

The swing bridge will be inspected and consideration of its future has been delayed till after that.

The CWA thanks the Council for more storage space [at the Town Hall] and says £30 will be available when a sink has been purchased.

The Department of the Interior requests Council considers selling a portion of Howard St 19 ft 10 inches wide by 72 ft 10 inches long from Lloyd St end and asks for the price required.  [This is the strip of land behind the area then being considered for, and later acquired for, a new post office.]  The Council resolved that the required road be sold for £80 with transfer cost to be paid by the purchaser.

Burra Electric Supply Co. replied to a letter saying it would negotiate with ETSA if the Trust approached it.

The Town Clerk reported on the Council elections as already noted in the papers of 15 May and 5 June.

It was resolved to form Elphick St when the plant can be hired from the District Council.

A light will be installed on the swing bridge and the approach to the swing bridge will be repaired.
