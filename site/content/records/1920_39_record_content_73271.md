Obituary.  Henry C. Webster died suddenly on 9 December.  He had been in town in the afternoon, returned to his Springbank property, went out with a lad he employs to do the milking and dropped dead in the cow yard.  Mrs Webster was in Adelaide and the lad contacted Mr Crawford Webster of Shafton, the deceasedâ€™s brother.  The deceased was the second son of the late H. Webster of Shafton and was born 22 June 1891 [near Clare] and educated at Copperhouse School after which he took up grazing and farming with his father.  When war broke out he enlisted in 32nd Battalion and saw service in France.  On his return he resumed farming and when Springbank estate was cut up he acquired a block.  In 1927 he married Miss Grace Lloyd, younger daughter of Mr & Mrs Lloyd of Ironmine who survives with three young children.  The cortege on Sunday afternoon was one of the longest for many years and many returned soldiers were present and were led by Mr Stanley Hawker the President of the RSL, they formed a guard of honour and six acted as bearers.
