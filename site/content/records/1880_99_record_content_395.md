Editorial on the Public School System.

The new Education Act has seen money expended on large buildings in the big centres of population, but nothing in the outside districts and many small schools were closed.  The system is at fault.  Teachers strive hard and frequent illness and resignation is testimony to the heavy tax on their mental and physical health.  Teachers are badly treated - they are sent at a moment’s notice to places they have to reach as best they can.  They must stay where they can find accommodation.  In addition the Burra School, to take an example, is denied its due number of assistants.   First and second assistants are often dispensed with and second or third assistants made to do their work for no additional pay.  When the school opened with c. 200 students the staff was the head teacher and one monitor.  The head himself had to find three teachers and a pupil teacher from Victoria and then had great difficulty in getting them recognised.  After much pressure a headmistress was appointed, but only for a short time.  The only male teacher on whom the head could rely was removed.  It is beyond all reason to expect the headmaster to teach all the boys, instruct the pupil teachers, supervise the playground and administer the whole school.  At least another male teacher is required.  The Board of Advice has made sundry recommendations, which deserve speedy adoption.
