Rounsevell said he had proposed first a land tax and then an income tax and then after the gradual abolition of subsidies, a stamp tax which Holder said would add  £1 tax to every man, woman and child.  Dr Stephens had no knowledge of the editorial and should not be damaged by assertions to the contrary.

Mr Rounsevell said Mr Holder’s explanation was specious.
