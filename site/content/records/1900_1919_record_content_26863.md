King Edward VII Memorial Service

This was one of the most impressive memorial services for a long time.  It was held in the Institute Hall and had been arranged by the town’s ministers and Salvation Army Officer.  The hall was packed, with many standing outside the doors.  The ‘Dead March’ in ‘Saul’ was played by Mr G.E. Dane and the service was conducted by Rev. S.J. Bloyd of St Mary’s, Rev. T. Weatherill of Redruth Methodist Church and the local representative of the Salvation Army.  Rev. H.C. Farley of Kooringa Methodist Church delivered a powerful and solemn address.  The Mayor and all the Councillors occupied the platform.  A memorial service was also held at Burra Public School, where short addresses were given by Rev. S.J. Bloyd and Dr J.I. Sangster, Chairman of the School Board of Advice.
