Burra RSL AGM

Elected were: President, C.H. Griffen; Vice-Presidents, H. Cornelius & V. Riggs; Secretary, J.W. Sorrell.

Mr C. Griffen, as President, reported on a successful year.

There were a number of pleasant social evenings.  In September Mr Eastick visited and gave an address on Korea and there had been a series of exchanges with other branches.  The Anzac Day Parade was well attended and we were represented at Remembrance Day and at Air Force Week.

We also contributed to the success of the coronation celebrations.  Tow Legacy Wards were sponsored at £25 each.  Badge sales were undertaken.  We joined in the appeal for funds for War Graves.  The annual ball went off very well and there was excellent patronage.  The usual smoke social also went off successfully. With the Air Force Assoc. we staged a successful Christmas tree.  Comfort parcels were sent to two young men from the district serving in Korea.  Trees given by A.R. Murray were planted on the eastern approach to the town by the Combined Ex-servicemen’s Assoc. of Burra.  We regret the passing of two former office-bearers in Cyril Collins and Twist [Oliver] Ockenden.
