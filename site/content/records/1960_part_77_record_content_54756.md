Reprint from the Advertiser 5 January 1891 of an article by ‘Melas’.

A few remains of old huts will enable a visitor to Burra to form some idea of what and where they were when occupied, but they are crumbling away and in a few years hardly a vestige will remain.  Only a few of their occupants now survive and materials for this sketch came from their lips and pens.  The first two huts it seems were formed by the late Messrs John and Robert Collins, not far from the site of the Kooringa Hotel.  Soon huts lined the sides of the creek for nearly two miles and over 2,000 people lived in them.  The clay banks were almost ten feet high and easily excavated.  The roof was pierced and stones or a small flour barrel formed a chimney.  From the footpath one could see the fire places, the tea kettle and frying pan in use.  When an opening was left without a chimney persons sometimes fell in and many amusing stories are told of the tricks played by boys dropping things down.  The number of rooms varies from two or three to five and six and at least one resident wrote to a friend in England saying he had ‘an eight roomed house with a river frontage’.  A row of large gum trees lines the creek.  The sight at night with lights shining through the windows was imposing.  The huts were cool in summer, dry in winter and cosy.  Lime was freely applied and some rooms were papered and carpeted and the crude furniture of early days gradually became very comfortable and even luxurious.

Our informant spoke of the great weakness of the women of the creek to bake rich fruit tarts on Sunday afternoons and to their being annoyed if the visitor did not eat and drink a cup of tea with them, even if he had done so with others six times before.

Flood made havoc of the huts when the calling of geese, squealing of pigs, quacking of ducks and the roaring of water mixed with the screaming of women and children and the struggle of men to rescue their effects.

A witness described the flood of 12 May 1851.

People were getting their clothes ready for the tea meeting when a few large drops of rain fell near Longmead’s Store.  Soon people ran towards the creek from all directions.  The witness saw one man hand his children up to his wife on the bank as the water rushed past.  Sofas, boxes, beds etc. were being rescued or were floating towards the cemetery.  In the main street the water was ‘up to my body’ and a new bullock dray was swimming down with the wheels going round like the paddles of a steamer.  There were some narrow escapes and much loss and ruin.  The flood of 1859 did so much damage that few persons lived in the huts after that.  In 1877 the flood rose above the banks and carried away the old Kooringa Bridge for over a mile.  Cooper and Bailey were unable to display their menagerie.

Mr James Blatchford reached Burra in 18847 after a week’s journey from Adelaide by bullock dray.  He dug a hole near the smelting works and never lived more comfortably in his life.  He sold it for $28 and it was destroyed in the next winter.

The late Mr Daniel Llewellyn came to SA in the Prince Regent in June 1849 and proceeded to Burra where he bought a creek hut for $7.  It comprised a kitchen 10 ft long and 8 ft wide and a bedroom 8 ft square.  Both were 7 ft high.  A third room was formed 15 ft x 10 ft.  The walls were smoothed with an adze and whitewashed.  Five feet was curtained off for a bed and in the rest Welsh services and a Sunday school were carried on for a year, with a good attendance.  This hut was destroyed by the flood of 1851 and everything within it buried. A large costly Welsh Bible was dug out along with other books.  Mr Llewellyn agreed to buy another hut for $10 and paid $10 deposit. [sic?]  Within a month the second flood came.  He hurried from church to save his effects, caught a chill and died.

[Died 26 June 1851 aged 34.]
