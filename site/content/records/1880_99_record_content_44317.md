Mr A.H. Forder is about to move from his Nelson Hills property to ‘Wattlegrove’ where he intends to expand his dairy business.  He is also about to purchase a cream separator to make butter, at a cost of c. £200.  For a considerable time he has been supplying Broken Hill with milk and has gained a good reputation for its quality.  He has over 100 cows on the farm, most being milked daily, but when the new industry is complete he intends purchasing milk from all vendors in the district.
