The State heritage Branch provided a $10,000 cheque, which was handed to Goyder Council last week by the Heritage Advisor, Douglas Alexander.  This is a one-off grant over and above the normal Stage Heritage Fund grant.  Burra’s Heritage Advisory Committee will formulate guidelines to spend the grant.
