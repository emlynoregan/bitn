A Petition is circulating for the release from prison of Julius Lehman who was sentenced to three years some fifteen months ago for killing a pig on Mr Fairchild’s property.  Woodman, who received two years for the same offence, was released after fourteen months.  It is hoped the festivities on the conclusion of the war and the coronation will combine with the petition to make the authorities view the matter favourably.
