Apology.  The paper apologises for publishing a letter on 8 October under the heading ‘Goyder Uprising’ that conveyed a defamatory imputation of and concerning Mr Bill Mader, former financial manager for the Regional Council of Goyder.  The paper ‘acknowledges that there is no basis to suggest that Mr Mader acted in any way improperly in his former position as financial manager for the Regional Council of Goyder’.
