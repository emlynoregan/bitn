Robert Carson was charged by Robert Collins with taking away a bullock belonging to him.

James Tarr gave evidence that the bullock in question was one he had sold to Robert Collins.

Carson said the bullock belongs to him and he had lost it about three years and eight months ago.

Collins said he had bought the bullock from Tarr in May 1850.
