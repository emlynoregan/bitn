Show Society.  Committee meeting 9 May.  The ring has been marked out and will be 12 yards over Victoria Park in circumference.  [In the next issue this was corrected to Jubilee Oval, Adelaide]  The contract to floor the luncheon pavilion has been let for £107 and it has now been laid.  N.H. Pearce has bought the trough and windmill for £25 and filled in the well.  A local syndicate has agreed to erect 37 chains of 6’ iron fencing for the advertising rights for 10 years - to be completed by 1 August.  This has saved the cost of c. £500.

The next show day will see a special train from Terowie and one from Adelaide - at least the latter if the railways agree to a siding at the showgrounds.

A room for exhibits will be erected 70’ x 24’.

Mr Chambers offered to see a wire fence erected at the back of the grounds.

It was resolved to incorporate the society as the Burra Burra Show society, dropping the old title of Burra and North Eastern Agricultural, Horticultural and Pastoral Society.  Mr McBride’s men are at work levelling the ring.
