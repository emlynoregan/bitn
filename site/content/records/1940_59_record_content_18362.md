Salvation Army.  Commissioner Dalziel, in charge of the Salvation Army in the Southern Areas, visited Burra on 24 July.  The Mayor entertained the Commissioner at a dinner at the Kooringa Hotel, after which the party adjourned to the Salvation Army Citadel, where the Mayor extended a civic welcome to the Commissioner.  Two previous Commissioners had visited Burra: Commissioner Roy in about 1922 and Commissioner MacKenzie in 1932.  Cr Kellaway spoke in support of the Mayor’s remarks.  The Commissioner said a number of Burra’s citizens could be ranked among prominent Salvation Army officials, including: Brigadier Bruce in Cottesloe, WA and Brigadier Adams.

[The Commissioners speech is reported at length.]
