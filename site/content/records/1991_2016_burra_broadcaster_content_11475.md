The Council Amalgamation Public Meeting

About 60 people attended the meeting.

Consultant Michael Barry was asked, ‘Where are the rate savings?’

Mr Barry replied ‘You won’t get it unless you give up significant reductions in service.’

[Ignore the double negative!]

The newsletter to householders said there would be a reduction of 3% in the total rates collected in the 1997-98 year, after which a rate equalisation program would be introduced.

Mr Barry said after the input of much work the working parties had come up with a workable solution.

John Monfries commented from the floor that if Councillors were not allowed to make the decision the Reform Board would step in and decide for them.

It was outlined that Burra rates would drop 9%.

Hallett’s would go up 20% over the ten year period, till parity was achieved.

The greatest concern overall was for local employment.  The letter to householders said there was very little fat to be cut in District Councils and most of the benefits of amalgamation would be directed to protecting and improving levels of service delivery.  If Government grants were cut in the future, it would be road maintenance that suffered the most.  Past Council Chairman Jack McMahon spoke to say that he didn’t think they had any real choice but to make the most of the present changes.
