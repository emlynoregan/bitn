Burra Benevolent Society met on 19 July and reported having only £4 in hand.  There were 27 on the present list and it was suggested they reduce wood deliveries from 5 cwt to 2½ cwt, but Miss Coglin has offered to collect funds and the society will continue for the time being with 5 cwt deliveries.  The Red Cross and General Aid Societies will also be approached.
