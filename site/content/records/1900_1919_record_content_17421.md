Court.

Francis Ford and Arthur Collins have been charged on the information of T.P. Halls jun. with cruelly torturing and injuring a greyhound, the property of Halls, on 4 May.  He claimed Â£5 compensation.  [The allegation was that they poured kerosene over the dog and set it alight.]  Due to the illness of Collins the case was adjourned for one month.
