Burra Meals on Wheels acknowledged 40 years of community service at their annual barbecue for volunteers last Thursday.  MOW Volunteer manager Pina Noack presented Burra Chair Bev Fleming with a special plaque.  Shan Nourse and Pauline Venning receive badges for 20 years’ service and Eunice Baker received a pen for 35 years’ service.  Three of Burra’s original members were present: Jan Tiver, Muriel Bence and Betty Thamm.  Special mention was made of Mrs Anne Finch, another original member who died recently.  At the meeting Peter Ferris replaced Shana Nourse as Treasurer after her 20 years in that office.  Jan Tiver has been secretary for 20 years.  Marg Dunstall is the Welfare Officer.
