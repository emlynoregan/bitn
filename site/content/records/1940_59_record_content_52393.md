Myxomatosis is a mixed blessing according to some farmers.  While many say it will do away with rabbits and leave more feed for sheep, others are fearful that without rabbits the numerous foxes will turn to lambs.  At Spalding last season one landowner claimed that after myxomatosis foxes got 76% of lambs.  Others fear its spread to humans.
