Burra Regional Art Gallery.  The Art of the Flower exhibition was opened at the gallery on Friday night (the 5th year of the event).  108 paintings were submitted this year and the winner was Robert Hannaford with an oil painting of roses.  The People’s Choice is still being voted for.  Running concurrently in the Bence Room is the exhibition ‘It’s My Party’ by Glenys Christopher – a display of portraits to mark her 60th birthday.
