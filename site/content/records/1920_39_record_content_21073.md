Burra Hospital Board, 25 October

The Matron attended and said she was extremely annoyed when she read Mr Warnes’s remarks about the abuse of furniture in The Record.  Mr Warnes had spoken of a number of legs being off chairs.  There was in fact one and that had been done and repaired before her time.  She could not see why present staff should be blamed for what had happened years ago.  Mr Melrose didn’t think the Matron should feel hurt because of the comments of one member of the Board.  The Chairmen said in his opinion the Matron and staff were justified and the Board should have repudiated the remarks of Mr Warnes when they were made.
