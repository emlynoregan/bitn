Subject to more reliable testing, I would estimate that if treated by leaching with sulphuric acid they would yield a profit of £150,000.

Two bore holes were put down in 1898-99 under Government supervision.

In 1907 boring operations were carried out by a Kooringa Syndicate led by W.A. Horn of London, holding an option over the property, but nothing of importance was discovered.  Boring was difficult in broken ground.  The Government Geologist then though that boring was unnecessary and there was sufficient data from old records and the 1898-99 work to justify  restarting the mine by continuing operations from Morphett’s Shaft.

The Prospectus of the Burra Copper Co. N.L. 1901 said:

In 29½ years about £4,750,000 worth of copper ore was obtained.  Large profits were absorbed in outlay for machinery, plant, buildings etc. and over £800,000 was paid in dividends.  The working of the mine was suspended in 1877 for a variety of reasons:

Proper steps to develop it at depth were not taken until visible supplies of oxidised ore started to give out.

The price of copper began to fall.

There was no reserve fund.

No capital was available for the dead work.

Work was suspended just as deep sinking had proved the existence of sulphide ore some 300 feet lower than the deepest point at which oxidised ore had been found.  The workings have since been under water.  Reports show that no extensive operations had been conducted in any part of the mine below the 300 ft level.
