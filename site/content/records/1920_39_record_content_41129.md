CWA Continental at Wahroonga last Wednesday evening had to contend with a cold night that penetrated even rugs and cloaks. The wide balcony accommodated the performers easily and the terraced lawns provided ample space for the audience.  The Burra Band under J.H. Murison presented a good program supplemented with other solo performances of instruments, songs, elocution and duets.  The Burra Quartette presented four songs and was recalled each time.
