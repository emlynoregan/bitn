W.J.C. Ewins sued Edward Dollard of Booborowie £16-5-0 for damage to his car when Dollard’s horse and buggy ran into it on Morehead St near Taylor St.  The car was completely on its correct side of the street at the time and at the moment of impact was stationary.  The detailed evidence extends for c. 1¼ columns. [And includes some from Maurice Fuss]  August Fuss had measured the tyre tracks of the car the next morning about 133ft from the collision.  The tracks were over the crown of the road, but 33’ from the collision the tracks were on the proper side.  The verdict was for £8 damages plus costs.
