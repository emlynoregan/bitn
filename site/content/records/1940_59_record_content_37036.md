St Mary’s Sunday School, which has been closed for some years, reopened last Sunday with 31 prospective pupils.  Miss Nin Morrison MA, the Diocesan Organiser for Religious Instruction attended and gave the teachers a demonstration of hot the Kindergarten section should be organised.  She had met teachers the previous night at the Rectory and talked to them about Sunday School organisation and equipment, including the use of a strip film projector.  The school will be open every Sunday at 10 a.m.
