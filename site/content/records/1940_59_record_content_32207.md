Road Collapse Reveals Shaft

An old shaft at the side of Johnson Carpenter’s property had been covered with timber and 3 inches of soil and forgotten.  Later a track was made at its edge and recently used by motor cars and laden trucks.  On the night of last Wednesday-Thursday the capping fell in revealing the shaft for a depth of c. 70ft.  Fortunately there was no traffic around at the time.  It is only 30ft from Mr Carpenter’s fence.  The shaft will be used as a rubbish dump until filled up.
