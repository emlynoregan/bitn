The Old Fire Station Closes

The Market Square Fire Station will close today when the MFS relocates to the old ETSA facility on Smelts Road.  At 2 p.m. Ilene Campbell, daughter of the first station foreman,1 and the Council CEO Steve Kerrigan, will officially close the door for the last time.  The new location will be shared with the SES.  The MFS has been providing fire protection and other emergency services for the township and surrounding community2 continuously for 83 years and will continue to do so.

With the rapid growth of rural support industries and constant threat of fire in the two flour mills3 operating in the Burra township in 1917, the Burra Town Council approached the SA Fire Brigade to provide fire protection to Burra township and the surrounding communities.

With the completion of the Burra Fire Station at Market Square in 19204 came the first petrol driven fire engine to the town and additional protection for residents and industries.

Until the mid-1940s the only method available for alerting fire fighters was the town’s bell5 – today located at Morphett’s Enginehouse.  After WWII the town was given permission to use the wartime air raid siren – tested every morning at 7 a.m. until the mid-1980s.

Since built, the station has seen two minor additions.  A small office, shower and toilet area was added at the back of the building.  This office was later enlarged to provide room for the station bed.  This was due to a requirement for a fire fighter to be on duty at night to activate the siren from the station after hours.  Only in the 1970s did this become unnecessary, when the task could be performed from fire fighters’ homes.

For some years the station has been too small to adequately house the MFS facility and the move will allow for a larger and more modern fire engine.

The Burra National Trust owns the original Model T fire truck [Photo].  It was purchased from an Eyre Peninsula farmer and restored.  The Trust also owns two other Burra fire engines – the 1936 Diamond T and the 1948 Dennis, which have done the Bay to Birdwood Run for a number of years.

[1 The first station foreman was H.R. Bosisto, who was appointed early in 1922.  He was in charge at least till late 1923.  Ilene Campbell’s Father was W.J. Lee, who was certainly one of the firemen, but further research would be needed to see if/when he took over the role of foreman.

2 The idea that the MFS operated outside the Town Council Area, at least until the amalgamation of the Town and District Councils, needs research.  The idea that the Town Council would happily fund activities in the District Council area seems unlikely.

3 Butterworth’s Mill operated only between 1874 and 1892.

4 The site for the Fire Station was not approved until early 1922.  The building was completed in August 1922, the same week that the Model T Ford fire engine arrived on Thursday 17 August.

5 The fire bell was originally located at the Kooringa Police Station, where it had been for many years.  The Town Council passed a resolution to relocate it to the Fire Station in November 1923, though they had only a little earlier considered such a public position was too tempting for misuse.

A siren was installed in 1925.]
