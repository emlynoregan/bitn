Editorial on the Boiling Down Question.

Every few days Aberdeen and Redruth people have had the stench of boiling down operations.  It has been complained of repeatedly and been before the Central Board of Health more than once.  We are glad to say that following a complaint now no boiling down can be legally done within the limits of the Burra Corporation.  ‘Councillor Rabbich would have taken a manly part in the discussion had he fought his own battle and refrained from dragging his brother slaughtermen into the mire.’

There has never been a complaint against Messrs O’Leary and it is very hard they should be debarred from boiling down their waste meat.  The penalty under the Act is £1-£2 a day.  The Central Board advises that the local board has abundant power to deal with and suppress the nuisance.  We congratulate the Mayor [Dr Brummitt] on the firm way he dealt with the awkward question.  He has long been seen to conduct the affairs of Council in an admirable manner and we commend the Council for its decision.  Within 24 hours an untenable [sic] house nearby was let.

[Presumably the word in mind was untenantable, if the word is admissible.]
