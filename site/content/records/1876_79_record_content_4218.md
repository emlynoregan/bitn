Hallett Railway. A sarcastic article claiming that the following advice was taken: - 
• choose the lowest ground 
• choose ground closest to the main stream where all the tributaries will be at their broadest 
• run the line parallel to the road to encourage restless horses 
• have as many road crossings as possible 
• avoid Govt. Reserves and run across farmers’ land far enough in to give cause for substantial 
• find a bog for the terminus at least a mile from town 
• use as few culverts as possible and ignore local advice re water flows 
• if you are facing the embankments do so only on the side opposite from where the water comes. 
• ensure any turntable is located so it will fill with water at every rain 
• the Burra-Hallett line matches these desirabilities most closely 
With respect to extending the line from Hallett we believe an analysis of where most traffic from the area is headed — Port Pine, or Adelaide — should determine where the break of gauge should occur. At present this would suggest a break of gauge near Ulooloo or between there and Yarcowie.
