Building in Burra.  There has been a revival of building with fully a dozen new houses erected or in course of erection and all are in West Ward and all will add to the appearance of the town, especially the residences of Messrs Blight Bros. (late of Hallett), of A.S. Martin (Manager for Elder, Smith & Co.) and of Mr Gordon (of Bennett & Fisher Ltd.).  W.R. Chambers (of Bagot, Shakes & Lewis Ltd) has purchased a fine block in Queen St and building will soon start.  S.M. Laneâ€™s house is now roofed.
