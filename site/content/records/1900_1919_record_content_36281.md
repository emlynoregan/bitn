John Reed visited his Mongolata farm last Friday and found that his manager there, Tasman Chaplin, had gone mad and was running around naked except for a belt.  The house had been largely wrecked with the windows and their frames smashed.  He came quietly into Burra and has been taken to the asylum by M-C Skinner.
