  Despite the damage the water will give a great start to the season and provide plenty of feed for lambs.  Already a green tinge has appeared.

  Len Gordon’s ‘Coonabar’ adjoining ‘The Gums’ recorded 3 inches or more and miles of fencing have gone there too.  Sheep losses are expected.  A lagoon on W.E. Hodge’s known as Kickebusch’s adjoining Gordon’s has been empty for years, but is now full.  A.G. (Tom) Heinrich cannot state his losses on his property adjoining ‘Coonabar’, as he is busy restoring fences.  The first rain there yielded 40 points, but between 3 & 4 p.m. he recorded 280 points before hail blocked the gauge, so it was undoubtedly higher.  Fallow land washed away and the flat at World’s End from Rooke’s to the creek (about 4 miles) looked like a lake and is now covered with about 6 inches of silt.  He had to sandbag his homestead.

  Colin Bruce at ‘Almonda’ reported 214 points with all dams full and no significant damage.  F.J. Duldig got over 2 inches with some water entering the house.  Others at World’s End: A. Duell, E. Phillips & W.H. McWaters reported about 75 points.

  J.R. Rooke on the flat below Mr Heinrich’s heard the roar of the approaching rain from the Princess Royal Hills and he got upwards of 3 inches.  He was caught in it trying to move some sheep to higher ground.  About 1½ miles from home he was surrounded by flood waters when C.H. Hentschke of Robertstown came along with a team of six horses and a wagon.  They were able with this to negotiate water up to 3ft deep, though with difficulty.  Mr Rooke has not seen the like in 40 years at World’s End.  Neither had Mr & Mrs Sam Finch.

  Klaebe’s Creek brought down sheep and their carcases were left in the tops of some of the old huge gum trees en route.  At Princess Royal the afternoon rain was preceded by a hailstorm lasting three quarters of an hour.  Damage to the homestead resulted from hail blocked gutters.  Again the registration of 3½ inches was underestimated by hail blockage.  Heavy rain also fell at Black Springs.

  Further reports came in on Friday: Faraway hill 100, Kia Ora 130, Woolgangi 138, Quondong 44, Koomooloo 88, Sturt Vale 23 and Baldina 112.

  Mongolata Goldfield recorded between 1 and 2 inches and tons of earth were washed into diggings in some places.

  Mt Bryan area reports falls between 40 and 150 points.  Jack O’Connor of Mt Bryan reports the hail the largest he had seen.  Further west Booborowie got only 35 and Leighton 30 points.  Kooringa had 24 and Aberdeen 37.
