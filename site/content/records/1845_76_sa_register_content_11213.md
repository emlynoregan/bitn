‘Solon’ writes re the Northern Railway.

I consider the extension of the line from Kapunda to Burra is not what will best serve the interests of all north of Gawler.  I believe the main line should run about three miles west of Templer’s, cross the River Light at the bridge, then run in a straight line to the Stone Hut, continuing north into Farrell’s Creek to receive the branch rail from the Burra, distance about 8 miles.  A branch line from Kapunda should enter the main line at about Forrester’s, a distance of about 6 miles.  This would open up more agricultural land and have easier gradients that the Kapunda line.

[The writer goes on to develop his point about the best agricultural land lying to the north of Gawler, with his proposed route central to it, while the Kapunda line will lie on its eastern margin.  A terminus on Farrell’s Creek would give rise to a new town and would open up a large area of some of the best agricultural land in the colony.]
