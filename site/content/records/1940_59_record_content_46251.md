Local Board of Health

The report on the Burra Hospital, sought from the Central Board of Health, apparently has to come from the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Health and an application will accordingly be made for it.

The Burra Hotel was given thirty days to comply with the Act and end overflow from its septic tank into the Burra Creek, and to end the foul odour and remove the fly and mosquito menace.
