The ‘Miss Australia’ Disqualification Protest.

Mrs V.H. Shepherd, Honorary Supervisor of Units of FFCF writes in appreciation of the great efforts made by Burra units of the FFCF and regretting any difficulties arising from the ‘Miss Australia’ Contest.  However, she assures Mr Bence that their Organiser’s Department despatched from Headquarters to all Units taking part in the contest a circular which set out the required qualifications of entry, and that these were also advertised in the FFCF News Column of the Advertiser of 24 February 1945.

Mr Bence replied thanking her for her letter and expression of thanks to the Committee and Burra people.  He says he received the circular in question only last week after two phone calls asking for same and our secretary assures him that this has never been received by the Burra Unit.  As far as the press notice is concerned, the Burra Pin Up Committees were not organised until the beginning of April and so would not have been interested in a notice inserted in February.  He considered the Burra criticism fully justified.
