Burra Footballers trip to Wallaroo

Wallaroo 12.9 defeated Burra 6.3.  Some of the players contacted sailors from an English ship in port and there were shown over it and entertained on board.  The players were entertained to a dance in the Waterside Workers Hall on Saturday night.  On Sunday their hosts took them to a beach some 6 miles distant for a picnic, some beach cricket and a feast of crabs.
