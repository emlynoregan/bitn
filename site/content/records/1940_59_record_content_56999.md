Burra Hospital Fete was organised by various branches of the CWA & Red Cross in the district and was opened by Mr G. Stanley Hawker MP on Friday.  He was able to announce that £10,000 had been placed on Government estimates for this year, to be spent on building additions to Burra Hospital.  The fete raised about £300.
