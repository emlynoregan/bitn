Municipal Election, for North Ward.

Henry Roach	46

W.H. Hardy	26

Mark Linkson	14

Mr Roach was declared elected and he thanked those present.

Mr Hardy congratulated Mr Roach and said he had come out because the Mayor was riding a high horse, bluffing his Councillors and doing work unauthorised by Council.  He accused the Mayor of shutting up the minute book and declaring meetings closed without legitimate reason.  He claimed the citizens’ list for the election was not properly prepared.  He claimed Mr S. Harvey had been improperly prevented from voting and he quotes the Municipal Act of 1890 to support his contention.

The Mayor responded by saying that Hardy had great impudence in trying to dictate to him how the election should be carried out.  He did his duties to the best advantage of town and ratepayers.  No election had been held under fairer circumstances.  He would not listen to the remarks of the biggest ‘gas bag’ in the town – he questioned very much if the would be Councillor was a citizen and said he didn’t ‘come here to have a conversation with a fellow like you.’
