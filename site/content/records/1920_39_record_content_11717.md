Redruth Court, Thursday & Friday last

C. Parks v. Autocars Ltd for £312 for non-delivery of a motor car and damages.

On about 22 June the plaintiff was offered a new Overland car with extras for £312 in exchange for cash and his old car valued at £150.  The offer was in writing.  On 5 July the defendants took £162 and the old car and subsequently refused to deliver the new car.  The company denied that Spier & Palmer were their agents and therefore they had no liability and that the Sale of Goods Act Section 4 had not been complied with.  After the old car arrived in Adelaide Autocars called in a valuer who said it was only worth scrap and they were prepared to let the balance of the price stand at 8%.  Mr Parks replied that an agreement had been reached and asked for it to be carried out.  Much time was then spent disputing whether W. Spier of Kooringa was an agent for Autocars or not.  Correspondence between Autocars and Spier and the plaintiff was introduced.  Parks said of the agreement that the words ‘Subject to approval’ were not on it when he signed it.  It was made out by Palmer who was introduced by Spier as the travelling agent for Autocars.  The point of the defence was that though Spier and Palmer might be agents to sell cars they were not agents for the purchase of second hand cars.

There was then a deal of legal argument on when and if a legal contract had or had not been made.

The judge decided there was no case to put to the jury and the defendants’ case for a non-suit was granted.  The document signed was merely an offer to buy, but that offer had not been accepted by the defendants: it had been refused promptly and the plaintiff and Spier had been so advised.
