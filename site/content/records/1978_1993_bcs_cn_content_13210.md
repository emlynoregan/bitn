Burra Community Library.  The last week of the second term was very busy with the re-organisation caused by the completion of the History Room and text book store.  More than 15,000 books had to be moved and shelving and compactus had to be re-established.  Heavy antique furniture had to be moved upstairs to the mezzanine floor and huge tomes of equal weight then followed.

Morphett’s Engine House work is progressing and so is work at the Bon accord Museum.
