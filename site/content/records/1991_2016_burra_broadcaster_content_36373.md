BCS.  An asbestos removal team will begin work at the school on 15 April.  Colorbond will replace the asbestos sheeting on the Technical Studies Block, Redruth Building, the Community Library extension, the Gymnasium and the Administration Block.  The entire operation is costed at $1.5 million.  During asbestos removal the entire area, including the ovals, will be fenced off and no one, either of the staff or the community, will be permitted to enter.  As a result of this the school term will end on Thursday 14 April.  [Aerial photo of the school pointing out the roofs concerned.]
