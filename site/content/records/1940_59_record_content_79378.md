Burra Swimming Pool.  There is a call for old sheets of corrugated iron, which are needed to complete the forming for the walls of the pool.  It is hoped to complete the pouring of the walls for the deeper end of the pool next Saturday 27 October.  A fortnight ago half the deep end walls were completed, but it is felt that the job is being left to the ‘few’.  More iron, more cement, more money and more voluntary labourers are needed.
