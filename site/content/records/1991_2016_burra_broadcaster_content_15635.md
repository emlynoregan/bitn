Telstra.  Neil Gale, Operations Manager of Telstra Mobile Net in Adelaide, has confirmed that two mobile phone towers have been approved for erection in Hallett and Eudunda, with a tower for the Burra area to be approved next month.  This network will improve service of mobile phones in the area, though there could still be dead spots in hilly terrain.
