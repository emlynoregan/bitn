Burra Rifle Club.  Pat Hogan broke all previous Burra Rifle Range records on Saturday when he scored possibles at 500 and double 700 yards on Saturday for 105 off the rifle.  A fortnight earlier he had scored 104 to equal the record of Mr Alf Bevan.  Possibles at 700 yards were also scored by F.T. Marston & C.W. Edwards.  This effort virtually assures him of the W.G. Woodman Trophy and he and Marston are each on 48 points in the marksmanâ€™s section.
