Burra Civic Ball

About 180 people attended the Civic Ball in the Town Hall on Saturday evening.  Nearly all were in period costume.  The Town Hall was transformed for the event.  A flood-lit portrait of Queen Victoria was flanked by an Australian Flag and a Union Jack.  Pre-ball parties were held and local teacher Mr Roger Boehm borrowed a trap from the National Trust to take some guests to the event.  Burra Queen Scouts and Venturers dressed in red uniforms of the early colonial soldiers to for a guard of honour.  Chairman of the Burra Burra DC Mr James Hawker called on those present to pause and reflect on their ancestry in honour of the Jubilee.  Later in the evening the Governor of SA, Sir Donald Dunstan, arrived from Adelaide to officially open the ball.  He remarked that his great-great grandfather had walked to Burra in 1847 and later the Dunstan family had lived in one of the miner’s dugouts in the Burra Creek for a short time.  Later he cut the Jubilee cake (made by Mrs Penny Hawker) with his sword.  The Vice-Regal couple danced to 60/40 music provided by Morey Paley’s Dance Orchestra from Adelaide.  Dance Victoriana Troupe provided demonstration dances.  Among spectators was the Australia Day Citizen of the Year, Mrs Florence Scroop.  Claire Hawker presented Lady Dunstan with a posy, which, when she left, Lady Dunstan asked be given to Mrs Scroop.  This was the first civic ball in Burra for many years and had been organised by Cr Helen Stockman, the wives of Councillors and representatives from the National Trust.
