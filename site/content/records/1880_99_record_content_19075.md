New Bible Christian Manse.  The Rev. W.F. James arranged for the stone-laying ceremonies last Tuesday.  His Honour the Chief Justice was asked to lay the main stone.  His father, Rev. James Way, was a pioneer in the Bible Christian denomination in Australia and was minister in Kooringa when the foundation stone of the big Bible Christian church was laid.  His honour arrived on the midday train and had lunch at the church.  He proposed the usual loyal toasts.  Rev. James said the expected cost of the new manse was £700 and it was being erected on land got cheaply from SAMA.  £311 had so far been given and promised.  When Rev. James Way had arrived [in SA] there had been two Bible Christian ministers and one church.  Now there were 67 ministers and 216 churches with 5,296 members, 10,000 Sunday-school students and 20,000 adherents.  After various speeches they adjourned the few hundred yards to the manse site.  The contractors have the walls up to about 3’.  The rooms are comfortably large and will be lofty.  The house is in a villa style with provision for a seventh room at some time.  The chief memorial stone was of white freestone inscribed ‘This stone was laid by Chief Justice Way on Sept. 1st 1885’.  After a prayer by Rev. J.J. Salmon (Primitive Methodist) and a reading by Rev. G.E. Rowe (Wesleyan), the Chief Justice laid the stone.  A considerable sum was laid on the stone - his Honour leading off with £2-12-0.  Mr Bentley took a photo.  Mr R. Collins JP laid a stone representing the Mt Bryan Church.  Mr John Snell laid another in the name of the Sunday-schools.  Mr Holder laid the last stone in the name of sister churches.  They then adjourned for tea followed by a public meeting in the church, chaired by the Mayor of Burra and followed by supper in the schoolroom.  The proceeds of the day reached c. £70.
