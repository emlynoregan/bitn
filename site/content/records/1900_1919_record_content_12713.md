Christmas in Burra.  The town streets were more crowded on Christmas Eve than for many years.  Between 8 and 10 p.m. it was hard to pass on the footpaths and the main road also carried many hundreds of people.  The children mostly carried a trumpet and the like and their sound was heard from one end of the street to the other.  Though the hotels did good business there were no disturbances.  Business did a good trade, some selling all they had on offer.  Shop windows were decorated for the season.  There was no band this year, but about 11 p.m. carol singers set out to serenade a number of citizens.

New Yearâ€™s Eve passed without any larrikinism at all in the town and even walls and shutters survived unmarked.  But at Copperhouse a cart was placed in a wagon and several vehicles moved from their usual places.  At 12 tins, guns and other noisy things were heard and in the street the anthem Hail to the Newborn King.
