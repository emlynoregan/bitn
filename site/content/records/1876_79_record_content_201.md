In the past four weeks heavy rain has restricted surface work to three weeks, but underground work has continued apace.  Morphett’s Shaft advanced 7 ft.  The lode underlaying east has nearly gone out of the shaft and will be lost in another 6 ft.  The 70 crosscut east proceeds.  70 driving north has crossed the lode about 12 ft wide in low values and very wet.  60 crosscut east has been dammed and 60 north has been cleaned of sand and we are driving north to Peacock’s air shaft to bring the water to that shaft for pumping.  Peacock’s Air Shaft is approaching the 50.  The crosscut at 50 has been holed to Grave’s Engine Shaft, which is important work for the future of the mine below that level.  The mine is now thoroughly ventilated for about 400 fathoms in length, greatly improving air quality throughout.  50 fathom level has been cleared and secured from Peacock’s and holed to Roach’s Shaft.  This shaft is standing firm to 50, but full of stuff below.  The intention is to clear it to 60 and then ventilate the 60 fathom level.  Have cleared a branch level at 50, some 5 fathoms and holed to Ayer’s Shaft.  Ayer’s Shaft is firm, but full of stuff.  It is clear from the surface for a considerable distance and we will try to run it through.  The ground around this shaft should be suitable for some tributer’s pitches.  Clearing Roach’s and Ayer’s Shafts will ventilate the mine and enable working below the great excavation.  The northern end of the mine will be able to be worked by pumping water out through Grave’s Shaft.  Bunce’s Shaft has reached 18 fathoms and in a month we shall start crosscuts east and west under the old deposits of ore.  The new incline tunnel would have been completed, but the farmers have been seeding and have not had time to deliver cap-piece timber.  When this arrived it will take about three weeks to complete.
