ON CHRISTMAS EVE

1849

‘Murders in the mining town were not altogether uncommon.’

Burra in 1849 had a population of some 4,000 and was a roaring town of eleven inns with hard drinking bullockies and hard working miners in crude dugout homes in the banks of Burra Creek, of an incredible mixture of wild Irish teamsters, of hard drinking and hard fighting Cornishmen, tough Welsh and German smelters and an even more incredible mixture of the dialects from every part of Wales, Scotland and Cornwall according to a visitor of 1849.  Christmas Eve was traditionally a time for letting off steam in the mining town.  Christmas Eve was one of the few holidays granted by SAMA.  Bare-fisted fights and traditional Cornish wrestling matches took place each year, generally behind the one-storied Miners’ Arms Hotel (now the Burra Hotel in Market Square).  Sometimes as many as 500 miners came to watch the action.  Fights would be coming off all the afternoon and evening, a ring formed and kept by three policemen, powerless to do anything but watch for fair play.  There was no 6 o’clock closing and often no Sunday closing.  It is no wonder the gaol behind the Redruth Police Station had to be enlarged and a new one built in 1856.  Violence was always possible on such occasions and on Christmas Eve 1849 it led to murder.
