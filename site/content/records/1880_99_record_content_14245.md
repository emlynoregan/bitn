Wool.  The first load for the season arrived from Messrs Church and Warnes Dustholes Station.

Burra Waterworks.  Laying of the mains is proceeding.

Persons wishing to have water laid on and who have not yet applied are asked to signify such to the Council at once.

Kooringa Wesleyan Church organised a concert in the Institute on Monday featuring some of the colony’s most talented vocalists.  Mr & Mrs Crocker Smith, Mrs T.H. Jones and Mrs J. James presented a fine program aided by Miss Clarke and Miss Knight with overtures and Mrs H. Roach as accompanist.

Football.  North Adelaide visited at the weekend.

On Saturday Burra 2.14 defeated North Adelaide 0.1

‘A Looker On’ writes in comment on a recent Clare-Mintaro football game, which Clare complained about, and among other matters the writer considers ‘had the Clare team (or at least some of them) keep [sic] out of the public house they might have done better in the match’.

W.H. Hardy writes deriding Morris Rayner’s call for a lecture by Professor Custance.  Until the scheme of the Land Nationalisation Society is carried out farmers will not improve their lot.  Farms are mortgaged to the hilt and selectors are paying through the nose for their land and staring at high taxation.

‘Lectures from Government representatives - Bah.’
