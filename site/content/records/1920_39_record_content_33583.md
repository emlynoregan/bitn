Father J.F. Cullinan left Kooringa for Whyalla last Friday.  He was a broad-minded young man with a genial personality and had endeared himself to the whole community.  He recalled memories of the late Father Reddan who died some years ago whilst in charge of the parish and whose influence raised the tone of football, being one of Kooringa Clubâ€™s most prominent players.  Father Cullinan was farewelled on 16 February and presented with a wallet of notes.  Dr Killian, the Bishop of the Diocese was also present.  Father Morrissey has had to take sick leave and until he can take up the parish Father Hentschke from Jamestown will oversee it.

[James Patrick Redden died 1 June 1910 aged 40 at Pekina, residence Kooringa.  He was away on sick leave for long periods after 1906.]
