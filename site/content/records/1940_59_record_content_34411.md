Obituary.  Mr Rob McBride who died suddenly last week was a son of the late Mr & Mrs W.J. McBride of Burra.  He was born in this district about 47 years ago and lived here most of his life, owning the property belonging now to Mrs R. Ashton.  Some years ago the family moved to NSW to farm sheep on the Darling and were arranging to retire to Adelaide when Mr McBride died.  28 years ago he married and his daughter (Mrs Don Harvey of Tordown Station NSW) and son John of Adelaide survive.  [Robert James McBride born 6 February 1898 Graham Town, Burra: died 6 December 1947 Adelaide, residence Parkside.]
