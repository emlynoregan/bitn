Fire broke out in a shed at the rear of Bence’s Ltd and Sandy’s Serv-Wel Store on New Year’s Day at about 7.55 a.m.  The whole building and part of an adjoining fence were lost, though the fire was quickly brought under control by the brigade.  There have been two call-outs in the town since, for minor fires.
