Fire.  There is an article recalling the great fire of January 1919 which burnt 30,000 acres of grassland between Booborowie and Burra.  It urges land owners etc. not to allow it to be repeated by lack of preparedness or vigilance in a year of prolific growth.  In 1919 they were not prepared and there was no fire-fighting organisation.  Part of the 1919 report is reprinted.

Fire Control Officers are listed.

Locations of Water Tanks & Fire Pumps are printed.

Locations of Trailer Fire Pumps are listed.

Locations of Hydrants for the Morgan-Whyalla Pipeline are printed.
