The Midland Road Board inspected the Eastern Plains, Robertstown, Government Wells, and the Baldina Creek Road before arriving at the bridge on Friday for the opening at 4.00 p.m. Captain Killicoat made a speech and broke a bottle of wine over it: naming it the Redruth Bridge, and declaring it open.

The Mayor and official party then drove across it before returning to Kooringa for a banquet given by the Mayor at 6.00 p.m. in the new hotel. The usual toasts were proposed in champagne and about 60 places were set.

The toasts are reported in 1 column of detail on page 3.
