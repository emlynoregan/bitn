Burra Institute Committee.

Professor Henderson has agreed to give lectures on 18, 20 & 29 August.  There was discussion about charges for the lectures for the public.  Mr Harris pointed out that on the 29 August the hall was booked for films.  Mr Nield moved the offer be accepted.

Mr Fuss pointed out that cancelling the pictures would cost them a further £1-12-6.  The Professor will be asked to give the third lecture on the 28 August.

Professor McCully’s offer of three evenings with the poets at £2-2-0 per night was rejected in view of the above.

The undenominational meeting of the British & Foreign Bible Soc. On next Sunday will be allowed in the Institute: none of the Sunday schools being large enough.

Mr McLaren said the idea of a billiard room was dropped for the moment.  The hall committee wanted to make the present members’ room a library and build a new room for the members to the west of the present one.

Mr Fuss said it could be done for about £150 for a room 20’ x 16’.  He will prepare plans and estimates.

Rev. S.J. Hoban’s work is further reported in c. 1¾ columns.
