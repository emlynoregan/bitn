Damage to Property

Police are seeking help with respect to various damages done to local property.

Signage belonging to the Bon Accord Hotel on the Barrier Highway was painted out and covered with graffiti.

A side door of the former St Brendanâ€™s Catholic Church at Mt Bryan, now a private residence, was damaged in an attempted entry.

A window at the Burra Bowling Club was deliberately broken over the weekend.

Accident.  At 7.30 a.m. on Monday morning a Nissan sedan was overtaking a Toyota tray top about 1 km north of Mt Bryan when the Toyota turned to the right.  No injuries resulted from the subsequent collision, but the Nissan sustained about $4,500 damage and had to be towed away.
