Fire broke out on Pine Valley Station of H.V. Lord & Sons, some 75 miles from Burra, yesterday.  It travelled south towards Canegrass.  The Eastern District Fire Fighting Organisation got into action and soon had the fire under control, aided by a wind change to the southwest and some light rain.  The area continues to be patrolled.
