Sunday Rail Services

All country passenger rail services on Sundays have been cancelled.  As a result Freer & Scott’s bus service from Burra to Riverton to connect with the train has also been cancelled.  Free & Scott immediately applied to the Transport Control Board for permission to run a bus service to Adelaide on Sundays.  The Board has declined the permission.  Mr Scott waited on the Chairman and pointed out that Riverland, West Coast and Peninsula residents had Sunday bus services – even some that ran parallel to rail services.  Chairman G.W. Pope refused to reconsider the matter on the grounds that the Board hopes Sunday services will soon be resumed.
