The Plains East of Burra: Reprinted form the Register 22 August 1898.  (Continued.)

We followed the track to Morgan to the bottom of Greig’s Block, passing McBride’s and Pearse’s country.  We passed a narrow strip of green some 14-15 miles from Burra, which had caught some rain in February and June.  Greig’s Block is now owned by Mr Scott and enclosed by a vermin-proof fence.  It was badly eaten out years ago and the bush killed.  Feed is good after rain.  He has a dam over 15ft deep with 10 miles of drains feeding it and despite banking to exclude silting it has silted rapidly.  We halted at Mr Waddington’s homestead (now Grassville and owned by T.H. Pearse & Sons) 35 miles east of Burra of some 11,000 acres.  He has c. 1,500 sheep left out of 3,000 and no lambing for three years.  The country needs spelling, but it is hard to do this and pay rent and interest on fencing too.  Drift has caused great damage to fences and at sheep yards and woolsheds.  Dams are badly silted.

After agitation the country was opened to selection.  One farmer put in three crops, got nothing and left.  In places between Weddington’s and Barkers’ holdings the drift was within 9inches of the top wire of the fence.  We met a rabbiter who lived in a hut and said he got 10d per lb for skins. (12 skins weighed about 2¾lb.)   We stayed at Mr Killicoat’s homestead for the night.  All agreed the country should be dealt with by the Pastoral Board in big blocks.  Settlers affirm that miscellaneous and grazing and pastoral leases are the curse of the country.

The Land Board dealt with the country in 1889 which was the best season for 20 years.  As a result the gross rental and purchase value of the lands was estimated at the highest with no effort to strike an average.  No attempt to grow wheat will succeed.

Mr Pearse said he had 80,000 acres and was overstocked with 5,000 sheep.  No lambing for 5 years and only a few this year.  There was plenty of water, but no feed.  He was paying £2-13-4 a mile for country and had spent thousands of pounds in improvements.  Three years ago he put in 500 acres of wheat on half share and they reaped 50 bags.  A year later 800 acres yielded 49 bags.  1,000 acres this year would not yield anything of a crop and half the stock in the district had died.

Mr Hall has 1,200 acres in Hd Mongolata, five miles from Caroona Station and is paying £4 a mile for it.  This is his fourth year without wheat.  He has teams on the Barrier and keeps the place rather than the place keeping him.

Mr Hutchinson said on their route in the Hd Baldina Mr Halliday purchased 640 acres 8 years ago at £1 per acre and built a house for £800, but could not live in it on account of the dust and sold the whole property to one of the Kellock Bros. for £600 and Mr Kellock has since had to leave on account of the dust.

Mr Barker had a dam 17ft deep with16ft of water, but no stock as there was no feed.  At another dam sheep could not get within 12 yards of the water and died by the score faster than they could be skinned.  The dam had been closed as it would not pay cleaning it out.

On the way back to Burra the drift sand at one of Kellock Bros. fences was to the top of the wire and the fence was only two years old.  The Ranger’s house was deserted on account of dust.  Mr Morgan’s three daughters used to clear the sand by the barrow load, but in the end the family left and the front and back verandahs were several feet under sand.  The dairy and underground tanks were half filled with fine earth.
