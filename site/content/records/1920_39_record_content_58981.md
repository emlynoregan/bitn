100 bags at grass, estimated to average 1 oz per ton.  Two tons of low grade ore also at grass.

In the past 5 or 6 weeks we have been told of satisfactory results from a number of claims.

Baldina Mongolata GM Syndicate crushed 16 tons for 8 oz.

Terry’s Claim had a crush which averaged more than 1 oz per ton.

Another private claim crushed 25 tons for 55 oz.

Another party crushed 50 tons for over 100 oz.

The mines are now closed for Christmas.

The battery has been going all the year and of late has been running two shifts.

Byles’ Mongolata GM crushed 223 tons of overburden and quartzite from the beginning of the open cut and obtained 21 oz 16 dwt 13 gr by battery.
