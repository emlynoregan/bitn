2nd Leader on the Aberdeen footpath.  We think this a very worthwhile enterprise, but the over-ruling of Cr Sampson as representative of the East Ward, when there is little to spend on other East Ward work of higher priority, especially in the absence of the second East Ward Councillor [Cr Symons], was simply tyranny.  North Ward has always insisted on the right to spend ward funds as they see fit.  We are not surprised there will be a ratepayers’ meeting.  The proposal would take virtually all East Ward’s funds for the year.
