Burra Hospital Fete was held on Friday last in the Town Hall and was opened by Lady George.  The sum raised on the day was £680 and with some amounts yet to be finalised looks likely to be close to £700.  The fete was organised by various ladies’ organisations throughout the district.  Shortly after 5 p.m. the stalls were cleared.  Lady George (wife of H.E. Sir Robert George, Governor of SA) was accompanied by her son,Mr Anthony George and while in Burra was the guest of Mr & Mrs Andrew Tennant at Princess Royal.

[When final sums were done the total raised was £705-11-5.]
