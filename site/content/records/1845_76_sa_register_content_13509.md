Public Meeting at Kooringa

On Monday a meeting was held to discuss the memorial lately presented to Parliament by Mr Dale on the subject of the repeal of the tax on wood cutting.  Mr Arthur Motley was voted into the chair.

The object of the meeting was to dispose of any funds remaining and to hear from Mr Dale MP.

Mr Dale said he had presented the memorial and it had been agreed to have it printed.  He gave notice that he intended to take action on it and consulted others on the nest way to proceed.  The Commissioner of Crown Lands had asked him to postpone action for a week to allow the Government time to consider the matter.  On 30 May he had moved that the memorial be taken into consideration with a view to complying with the request.  He had spoken in support. The chairmen then read the Hansard report of his speech.  He had then withdrawn the motion when the Government assured him they would be introducing even more liberal measures without delay and the Government had communicated with interested parties who had been satisfied with the Governmentâ€™s promises.

It was resolved that Mr Bryar [or Briar?] be paid the balance in hand for arranging the meeting.

This concluded the meeting, but Mr Motley was voted into the chair to continue a discussion on the new tariff.

Mr Hervey asked why there were increased taxes on tea and tobacco and not on real property where absentee landlords would be paying.  Mr Dale said he preferred the latter taxes, but they could not immediately be introduced as they required a valuation of the whole colony.  It was true that some necessities of life had been taxed more heavily, but ad valorem taxes had been abolished and on the whole it was a good result.  The duty had been removed from many articles in exchange for an increase on spirits etc.  He agreed that sugar was a necessity, but thought the result overall of taxing just 15 goods was an improvement.  He went on to praise the Governments actions in abolishing immigration and in retrenchment.  It had also placed a liberal sum on the estimates for a bridge across the creek [at Redruth].

One voice suggested they could do without the bridge, but did not like the tax on tobacco.
