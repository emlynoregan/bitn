Weather.  The last week saw a succession of very heavy frosts and on two mornings they were so heavy the ground seemed to be covered with a layer of snow.  On the night of Sunday/Monday there was rain, then hail before the clouds moved on and a frost formed.  Later clouds returned with rain and a fall of snow for early risers.  More rain followed.  At 8 p.m. Monday there was a light fall of snow in the town, which gathered in drifts in gardens and the lee of buildings.  There were good falls on the surrounding hills during the day and Mr W.H. Sandland said that from Heathmont it was a fine sight to see snow falling on Sugar-loaf Hill.  Mrs W.H. Tiver reported a white mantle of snow on paddocks at Flagstaff in the morning.  Not much of the rain extended to the east where falls were generally below 20 points.
