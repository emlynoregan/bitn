It was blessed and opened for worship on 20 September 1903.  The blessing was conducted by Rt Rev. Monsignor Byrne VG, assisted by Rev. Fr O’Dowling SJ.  It was built on a block of land acquired for £10-10-0.  The architect was Mr John G. Hogan and the builder was Mr Pomeroy, assisted by Mr Bob Morris.  Tim & Joe Kelly dug the foundations and local stone was used.  In the 1920s a chancel, sanctuary and front porch were added.  In 1930 a small room was added on western side for overnight stays by the priest.  A centenary mass will be held on 14 September at 10.30 a.m.  [Photo of the building.]
