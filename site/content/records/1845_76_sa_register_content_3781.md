Obituary.  On 14 July trooper Guy of the Mounted Police arrived in Kooringa from Clare Village with the news that a respectably dressed man had been found dead in the bush about seven miles from Mr Hawkerâ€™s Bungaree Station.  A carpet bag was near the body.  Mr Lang was not well enough at the time to travel such a distance to hold an inquest.
