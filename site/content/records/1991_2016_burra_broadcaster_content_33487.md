Letter from (Red) Danny O’Brien, objecting to the fact that the students who were taught music privately outside the school were excluded from a music concert held for BCS students at the Community Sports Complex on 29 March.  Only students being taught privately at the school could participate.  This he believed was unfair discrimination.
