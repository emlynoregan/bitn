Nothing has been paid back to the original donors.  Small profits are spent in upkeep.

In April 1909 the Burra Show Soc. held a meeting to decide the site of shows.  P.L. Killicoat was President and Mr McLaren was secretary.  Mr Thomas Sandland attended in the interests of the Trust and promised five years use free of charge and to have the grandstand with enclosure ready for the 1909 show in September.  The offer was accepted and confirmed the same day by the Trust.

Mr John Melrose met the cost of moving and erecting all the cattle and sheep yards.

The free use was extended by the Trust to 8 years.

June 1917 Mr Warnes as President of the Agricultural Soc. [Show Soc.] with Mr Winnall waited on the Trust to ask on what terms the Show Soc. could have a lease as they were placing improvements on the ground.  The Trust explained it aimed to encourage all kinds of legitimate sport and hoped any improvements made by any body could be used by all.

The Trust carried a resolution granting the Show the right to hold their exhibitions on the ground for 21 years at a fee of Â£3-3-0 per year.

I believe a Show Soc. resolution accepted this offer.
