Captain Roberts the aviator visited on Tuesday last week.  He landed in a paddock nearly opposite Copperhouse, but a little nearer Aberdeen, owned by M. Collins MHR.  The party comprising Capt. Roberts and Mr Long of Louis Cohen Wireless Ltd were met by the Mayor, Cr Lee & Mr C.R. Wright of Wright Motors who had arranged the visit and by Mr Smith the local manager of Vacuum Oil.  Louis Cohen Wireless & Vacuum Oil are considering sending their representatives around by air and are now locating landing fields.  Capt. Roberts said the Burra strip was practically ideal.  He presented the Mayor with a wind ‘stocking’ to be flown at the field.  The Mayor was taken for his first flight, which he said he enjoyed enormously.  Two or three others also went for trips.
