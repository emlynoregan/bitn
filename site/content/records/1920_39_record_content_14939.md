W.C. Rabbich, [sic; actually W.T.] who was Mayor of Burra in 1893 and for many years a Councillor, visited Burra this week.  He went to WA and was Mayor of Boulder WA in 1904.  On two occasions while in the Burra Council he was fined £5 and £50 and his seat declared vacant.  It arose from a dispute in Council between wards and the awarding of road metal contracts.  He won in the end with Council apologising and wiping all references from the records.  His principal interests now are in the Williams District some 100 miles [SE] from Perth.  [His version of events given here is not quite correct and the highly entertaining affair is reported in great detail in the Burra Record over several weeks beginning 25 February 1891 and ending 22 April 1891.  The initial fine was actually £10 and in the end it was actually Rabbich who apologised, although in a form almost indistinguishable from that which had earlier been unacceptable.  A major factor contributing to his ultimate success was the Council’s decision that they couldn’t afford the cost of taking him to court.  The whole series of events reads like high farce.]
