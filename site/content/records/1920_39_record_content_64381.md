The Mayor said the construction had to be done in the proper was and there were too many loopholes for mistakes for ordinary builders.

Cr Dow favoured calling tenders.  They did not have to be accepted and if the lowest was for £900, then the Council would be justified in wanting to do the work by day labour.

‘A certain section of the people wanted tenders called because they thought the Mayor might be getting something out of building the pool.’

Cr Kellaway thought Cr Dow’s remarks were not quite in order.

The Mayor said he had a lot of mud thrown at him when he had taken charge of improving the Memorial.  He never got a thing out of it and he was not going to swallow all the muck all the time.’

Cr Dow said he had every confidence in the Mayor and was in agreement with the scheme for building the pool as outlined by the Mayor and thought it would be cheaper than calling tenders.  He thought two tenders should be called for the carpentering work – one by contract and one by day labour.

It was resolved that the Council meet at 9 a.m. the following day to select a site.

Editor: Since this meeting we have been given to understand on good authority that Councils borrowing money under the scheme discussed above may borrow from whom they please and the State and Federal Government guarantee to pay off two-thirds of the principal and interest with the Council in question paying the rest.
