Goyder Council is aware of the desire of ratepayers to see a properly appointed industrial area set aside in Burra and an area adjacent to Adchem is being considered.  It would of course need water laid on and three phase power.  Funds will be sought for planning and discussion with Adchem will follow along with ownership of roads in the area etc.
