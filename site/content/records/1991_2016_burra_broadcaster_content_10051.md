Council Amalgamation discussions continued.  The Mid North Local Government Region has released comments on proposals that Burra Burra DC will consider on 15 April and there will be a public meeting to canvass the issues in late April or early May.

The Government requires amalgamations and so far Kapunda and Light have successfully amalgamated and Angaston-Barossa and Tanunda are in the process.

A meeting of regional councils at Saddleworth on 3 April made progress on a potential pattern of amalgamation for the remaining Mid North Councils.

The current proposals involve:

Morgan, Ridley, Truro and Mannum to make a ‘River’ group.

Eudunda, Robertstown and Burra Burra with perhaps Hallett to form an ‘Eastern’ group.

Clare, Riverton, Saddleworth-Auburn with possibly Blyth-Snowtown to make a ‘Central’ group.

Blyth-Snowtown, Mallala and Wakefield Plains could make up a ‘Western’ group.

The councils concerned have yet to consider these suggestions and there would inevitably have to be some fine tuning and public consultation before any final action.
