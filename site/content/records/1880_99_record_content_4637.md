Banquet for H. Dawson was held at the Exchange Hotel on Friday 15 July.  The report runs to 1Â½ columns.  About 50 guests sat down to thank Mr Dawson who had been in the town for over thirty years - few had been longer.  W.H. Rosman said Dawson had been a great public worker who had pushed for the extension of the railway to Burra, was a member of the first District Council, a major promoter of the establishment of the Burra Hospital and a board member of it.  He believed that Mr Dawson had run the first cab in the town and conducted the first mail run to The Barrier.  He was a JP who had given every satisfaction and had helped many in sickness and distress.  C.W. Brown read the illuminated address.

Mr Dawson in his reply said that he had arrived in the colony aged 13, 29 years ago.  He had done bullock driving and various other things at an early age.

Other speakers included H. Pinch, Dr Brummitt, John Dunstan Jun., G. Butterworth, Mr Keynes and F.W. Holder.
