Council said it was in favour of preserving as many of Burra historic buildings as would interest tourists, but the sum envisaged to resite the chimney and other mine buildings was beyond the Councilâ€™s resources.  It would make available a suitable site and render whatever assistance was possible.

There was a letter from Alexander re the closure of Elphick Street.  Plans to be signed.
