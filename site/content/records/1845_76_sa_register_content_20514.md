Railway to the Burra

A meeting at the Burra Hotel on Tuesday evening discussed the question of a railway to Burra.  Despite very wet weather 130 persons attended and Mr A. McCulloch MP was voted into the chair.

Mr McCulloch said that the construction of the Roseworthy to Forresters [Tarlee] line had begun.  Last November the Chief Secretary said that to extend this line west of the Skillogolee Ranges and thence via the Gulnare Plains to Mt Remarkable would place it too far west.  He then considered going up the Gilbert Valley and Farrell’s Flat, which he thought too far east.

[Mr McCulloch said there were many views, but he favoured the Gilbert Valley to Saddleworth and thence to Farrell’s Flat.]

Wherever it goes there must be as least a branch line to Burra.  There are two important benefits of a line to Burra – the quickness of the transport of ore and the speed in the transport of stock.

Mr Challoner read a letter from Hon. J.H. Barrow alluding to support in the Advertiser, and the Chronicle for a railway to Burra.

Captain Killicoat proposed that the railway from Forresters north be proceeded with at once, as sanctioned by Parliament.

Some might argue that with the Mine closed a railway to Burra was now wasted, but the closure of the Mine was only for the present and there was still plenty of ore there.  What they needed was cheaper transport to make 10% ore marketable.  With that object gained mining might be carried on almost for ever.

[He then elaborated on costs and viability of the Mine for various percentage ore types.]
