Burra Races held on Wednesday last in a paddock of J. Dew’s at Springbank were quite a success.  There was a large attendance.  There was a slight accident when ‘The Earl’ fell at the first jump in the hurdles and its rider received a nasty cut on his shoulder.  Otherwise all went well.  Results printed.
