Burra Electric Supply Co. said that it could not make a reduction in the price for running street lights.  The price had been set some years ago and the cost of supplying current had since risen.  They could offer a reduction in the cost of running the Town Hall façade lights from 1/3 to 1/- per unit.  The cost of running them would thus be c. 7½d per hour.  The company could not submit a price for a light at the schoolhouse corner because of the difficulty of obtaining material.  The nearest main terminated at the rectory.  It was resolved to retain the new 300 c.p. at certain intersections.  They were much better lights and the added cost was only c. £12 p.a.
