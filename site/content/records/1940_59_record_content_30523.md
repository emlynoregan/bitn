Burra Burra Show Inc. AGM

President A.B. Riggs directed attention to the death of the late President I.J. Warnes, who held the office continually for over 30 years and also to the death of Mr C. Bartholomaeus who had been the society’s patron.  A minute of appreciation was recorded.

When the show was revived in 1946 after a six year gap for WWII the Society had an overdraft of over £600, about half of it accumulating during the previous six years.  A good deal of repairs etc. were needed to stage the 1946 show and finance was arranged through the Bank of Australasia.  Work was done on the cattle yards, but the sheep yards had to be patched up and shortage of materials means they will probably have to do for this year as well.  Eight loads of loose stones were raked up and removed.  Part of the iron fence will be sold and part of it retained to cover a sheep shed.  The sold portion suffers from storm winds and the money is better in the bank.  Despite poor weather the show was a success and the profit was £158-14-1.  Elected were: President, A.B. Riggs; Vice-Presidents, Messrs R.W. Humphrys & F.H. Reed.  Mr A.G. Owen-Smyth will be asked to become Patron.  To bring the asset values up to date they have been depreciated by 12½%.  This year’s show is to be on 11 October.  R.C. Lott wanted a return to the old showground [at the Aberdeen Oval/Racecourse].
