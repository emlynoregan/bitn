Burra Golf Club AGM was held 7 November.

The year had been a social and financial success.  All scrapes had received a heavy coating of slag, which served well.  A major project saw additions to the clubhouse and toilets, to enable the club to get a permit for refreshments.  Open day drew over 100 entries.  Club Champion this year was Hartley Strawbridge.  The heavy expenditure had left the club in debt, but this position was righted by members paying subscriptions in advance.  Elected were President, John Gordon; Vice-Presidents, R. Mason & I. McWaters; Captain, S. Longford; Vice-Captain, J. Bogisch, Treasurer, J. Bonython and Secretary, R. Jeffery.
