Resident Magistrate’s Court, Kooringa, 15 January

Miriam Kestel complained of the stench of three large pigs kept in a sty adjacent to her hut in the bank of the creek, by her neighbour Thomas Rowe.  Rowe promised to remove them within three days under threat of an indictment at the next Sessions for a nuisance.

Henderson was awarded £6-14-0 plus 28/- costs from Yates, who had burnt down a hut he owned and with it the complainant’s tarpaulin, water-keg, bows and yokes.

Prout was ordered to pay Kerr £9 for passing a forged note of that value.  Also to pay 24/- costs.
