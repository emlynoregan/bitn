Local Board of Health.

The Inspector reported that all meat in the town came from outside and therefore the whole of the killing was without inspection.

Mr Crewes said slaughtering could be enforced in the town if the Council provided a place.

Crs Killicoat & McBride said meat was too dear in Burra as it was.

The Mayor reported that the conference with the Hospital Board resulted in the Local Board of Health honouring accounts for infectious diseases except for enteric fever.  This amounted to c. Â£30, most of which could be collected from the patients.

Mr Winnall will draw up an agreement.
