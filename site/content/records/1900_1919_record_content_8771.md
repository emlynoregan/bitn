Douglas Methodist Church anniversary services were held on Sunday 1 November.  Rain fell and creeks were flooded which no doubt kept many away from the evening service.  Tea meeting was on Wednesday.  In the afternoon a cricket match was organised between a Burra team and the Mongolata Club.  It was drawn and at stumps Mongolata was 181 for 8 declared and Burra 34 without loss.
