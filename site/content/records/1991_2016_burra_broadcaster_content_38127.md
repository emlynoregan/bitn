Letter.  D.D. O’Brien writes condemning the Booborowie School Council for not letting Nathaniel O’Brien participate in their end of year concert.  He participated last year as he has piano and guitar lessons at Booborowie.  They wonder whether it has got to the stage that a nine-year-old boy is excluded because certain parties dislike his parents.
