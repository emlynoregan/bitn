Burra War Memorial Committee held its annual meeting on Monday.  Elected: President, Ken Murphy; Vice-President, I. Burdon; Secretary, J.C. Morrison and Treasurer, E.R. Davey.  The President reported a relatively quiet year.  The major effort was the Queen Competition, which raised £288.  Work at the oval was mainly maintenance.  The main worry was the basketball court, which is on built-up ground and suffered subsidence in the wet winter.  This will be rectified in the dry weather.  Repairs and additions have been made to the afternoon tea shed.  Experiments with grasses for the oval will continue.  After receiving tenders for a three-tier grandstand to seat 40-50 people on the western side of the oval, it was decided not to proceed this year as we may be short of funds for the completion of the basketball court and general maintenance, but we have put aside £250 to be carried into next year to carry out the grandstand project.  The stone wall needs repair and the floor of the dressing shed needs repair also.  Thanks go to Mr R. Fuss for work done for no charge and to F.M. Pearce & Sons for preparation of plans and specifications for the grandstand.
