The Ratepayers’ Meeting last Thursday evening.

About 45 people attended.  The Mayor S. Kellaway presided.

The first question was to ask the approval to borrow £400 by debentures on the security of a special rate of 7d in the £.

The second question was to ask if ratepayers were willing for the Council to take over the Institute.

21 ratepayers could petition for a poll on either of the matters within 24 hours.

Mr Kellaway said the Council had a debt of £575-5-2 at 30 June 1938, which did not include £400 to be spent if the swimming pool was constructed.  That £400 had been borrowed at 4¼% and £49-16-9 had been paid back leaving £353-3-7.  Their total debt was therefore £929-8-9, which was way in excess of what they were allowed to borrow on the General Rule.

The £400 on debentures was a sum to draw on till rates came in.  If the Council did not borrow the money it would be impossible to carry on unless the Council immediately struck and collected the General & Special 7d rates.
