Court.

Sapho Halls was charged with carnal knowledge on the information of H.W. Lihou.

Mr Lihou, butcher of Kooringa said Ethel Maria Lihou was his daughter and would be 16 on 17 August.  Halls was a cab driver for his brother and the cab stables were in Lihou’s back yard.  Lihou cautioned Halls for hanging around.

Mary Ann Lihou said she saw Halls on 5 March at her daughter’s window and followed him down to his house and called Thomas Halls and told him about it.  The defendant swore he had just got out of bed and had not been at the window.  Mrs Lihou took her daughter to the doctor for an examination.  She admitted her daughter looked over 16.  She said she saw Halls in her yard about 12.30 on 5 March – it was not a moonlight night.  Had not seen her daughter with Artie Dearlove or McNamara, but had seen her in daytime with Eustice, never with Harry Foster or McWaters.  Eustice, who is 22 used to board there.

Ethel May Lihou who will be 13 in October slept in the same room with Edith Maria.  Had seen Halls at the bedroom window on some occasion.  On cross-examination said she had slept in the room since 3 March and had never seen anyone else there.  Had seen her sister in the company of Dearlove at night time and walking with Harry Foster many times and had seen Edith walking with Jack Allen at night time.  Had never seen Dearlove or Foster in her sister’s room.

Edith Maria Lihou said she had known Sapho Halls for two years and he had behaved wrongfully once in his cab from the station, but no impropriety took place.

[Further evidence of this witness is unfit for publication – Ed.]  Knew Dearlove and walked with him and Harry Foster.

Arthur Frederick Dearlove (16) had seen Edith at night with other chaps.  She had told him her window was open if he liked to go up there.  Swore Edith told him Foster was no good because he behaved wrongfully with her, but never mentioned Halls.

Halls said he was a cab driver for his brother.  Knew Edith, but never walked with her.  She had ridden in his cab and he had seen her with other lads.  He was not guilty of any impropriety with her and had never been in her bedroom.

Paul Killicoat gave evidence he was in Halls’ company on 4 June.  [How this is relevant to charges relating to 5 March is unclear unless it is a misprint for 4 March.]

Thomas Halls gave evidence and Elizabeth Jane Halls said she knew Edith Lihou and most of her evidence is unfit for publication.

Mr Wadey for Halls asked for a dismissal as the evidence was too weak and uncertain for a conviction before a jury.  The first portion of offence had nothing to do with the charge.

Eventually the charge was dismissed.

Much sympathy is expressed on all sides for the parents of the girl; who are respected residents of the town.
