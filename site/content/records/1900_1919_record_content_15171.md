The season is not more than fair in Baldina, but the crops get steadily better towards Robertstown and are very good by Eudunda.  Manoora crops are good and Farrell’s Flat area has pretty fair average crops and at Leighton and Gum Creek they are good.  Further north crops are a bit thinner, but looking good.  Rain in the last week will have been a help generally to these crops.
