The Burra Institute.  The committee met on Monday when Mr Winnall said the fence had been erected to the satisfaction of the committee.  Mr Fuss, the President, reported the re-arranging of the flags in front of the building and that the tar-paving was in hand.

Nine members attended the annual meeting of subscribers.  There were 3,979 volumes in the library on 30 June 1906 and 4,050 at the end of the year.  There were 93 subscribers and the building had been thoroughly renovated this year for £57-10-6.

Tenders were called for acetylene lighting in June and H.S. Mozart of Gawler was successful.  The building was lit by gas on 14 July 1906 for a cost of £60-13-4.

Elections for 1907: President, J. Drew; Vice-President, Dr Sangster Jun.; Treasurer, Mr Wilkinson; Hon. Sec., Mr Winnall.

R. Woollacott, son of T.H. Woollacott of Redruth, has received his certificate of competency as an electrical motor driver in Broken Hill.

Burra Races will be held 20 March.
