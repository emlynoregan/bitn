District Council of Burra

W.T. Rabbich handed new Councillors J.C. Sandland and H. Finch a notice informing them they were taking their seats illegally when Council met on Saturday afternoon.  Far from this being the case there are several points that would tell against Mr Rabbich in any appeal to law: not the least of which is that W.T. Rabbich’s name does not appear on the District Council’s assessment roll.
