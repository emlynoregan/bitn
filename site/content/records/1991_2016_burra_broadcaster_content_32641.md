The business began in October 1988 when Elspeth Radford opened her first shop (next to Beaut Fruit) called Saltbush for Kids.  It was an immediate hit, with stylish country-style, well-made clothing.  Later she moved into adult clothing and the business grew.  Over the years Saltbush Clothing has won a string of business awards.  The departure of Saltbush and Glasgow House now leaves Burra without a clothing store.
