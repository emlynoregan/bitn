Alfred Ryan, Police Tracker:

There was a track from a galvanised iron fence to the window: a distance of about 11 paces.  Someone had stood there and the tracks returned to the fence.  The tracks suggest a hurrying person.  The tracks went towards the stable and got lost in motor traffic, but the same tracks come from the front of the house to the stable and return.  A circle round the house did not reveal tracks of a stranger.  Horse tracks led from the homestead to the back road.  Later he details how he tracked a horse to where the rider got off and then the tracks of the rider to a deep shaft in which he could see a gun.  The horse returned to the stable and then came from it galloping.  The galloping horse had gone towards Black Springs and after a while the horse stopped, rider dismounted, got back on and a mile from the homestead took a side road to a back way to the homestead.  This track eventually went to McCarthy’s Farm.  The tracks were those of the mousy-coloured chestnut.  The tracks to the shaft were the same as those made by Harold Escott.  He identified the prints in front of the window and near the shaft as those of Harold Escott.
