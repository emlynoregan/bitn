Solomon Williams: Reminiscences of Burra in the 1850s & Early 1860s.  (Continued)

No reminiscences of Burra would be complete without references to its religious institutions and activities.  The community was largely made up of Cornish people who were well known for their regular church going habits and their adherence to one of three sections of the Methodist Church.  Though there may have been some petty jealousies between the Wesleyans, the Primitive Methodists and the Bible Christians, each flourished and there was never any serious disturbance among them.  Special evangelical meetings were usual by each section in the winter months and much enthusiasm was manifested.

I have pleasant recollections of the Rev. Denzil John Holt Ibbetson, Rector of St Mary’s Anglican Church on Limestone Hill; now long demolished.  It was as a public lecturer that I most remember him.  He would demonstrate scientific truths with ingenious models.  He showed the elasticity of the atmosphere employing a fountain worked by compressed air.  Three wooden lathes fixed together showed the strength of materials.  He also had a model lattice bridge capable of carrying a 28lb weight.  Most impressive of all was a model hydraulic crane.  Rev. L.W. Stanton followed him and he was an entertainer with elocutionary subjects on prose and poetry, but I left Burra while he was still there.

Our family were Wesleyans.  There are now few who can remember the three Wesleyan churches that occupied the same site.  The first one was smaller and in the shape of a cross, having a nave and transept with three doors.  It was first lighted with tallow candles that needed snuffing and I have seen men stand on a chair to snuff then during a service.  Later sperm candles were used that did not require snuffing.  In 1856 a second church replaced this and a few years later a gallery was added.  This church was lighted by camphine lamps as shops were.  These gave good light, but camphine was expensive at 6/6 for a half-gallon tin.  [Camphine was a fuel obtained by distilling oil of turpentine.]

It seems to me that all my pleasures and entertainments centred upon the church, the Sunday school and the Wesleyan Mutual Improvement Society.  In my time the ministers were the Revs Harcourt, Flockart, Wilson, Lee, Lloyd, Colwell, Chester, Allen, Worth and Wylie.

I first remember the Bible Christian Church when Rev. Rowe was minister and the church was at the corner of Paxton Square.  He was succeeded by Rev. James Way, I think about the time the new church was built.  Other followed and Rev. J. Hancock was in charge when I left Burra.

The Primitive Methodist Church had been closed for some time when Rev. J.G. Wright came from England to resuscitate the cause.  He was energetic and an interesting speaker.  He began street preaching and then marched the crowd to his church and was quite successful.  He was succeeded by Revs. Allen, Whittaker, Cole & Wellington.  In Rev. Whittaker’s time they needed a gallery, but as the church was too low they borrowed screw jacks from the mine and lifted the roof seven feet an put in the gallery.

Each church had well-attended Sunday schools and the anniversaries were times of great interest to scholars.  Special speakers were used on the Sunday and singing by the scholars was of great importance.  The Wesleyans had their anniversary on Easter Sunday with tea on the Monday.  The cake required for the teas for both scholars and the public was made by the teachers.  On Thursday evening before Easter they met in the schoolroom where the ingredients were assembled.  A long table was set up and two or three people shredded lemon peel.  As there were then no Australian currants the imported article had to be prepared.  These were covered in a white substance that had to be first washed off in sieve in a tub of water and the currants then spread on a table and carefully picked over to remove small stones.  The dough was made in a large trough or trow as the baker’s called it and left to rise by morning, when it was taken by cart to the baker’s house where the baker did the rest.  He returned the cakes to the schoolroom on Saturday.

The present church was built about 1914.

There was another building known as the Independent Church across the road from the south side of Paxton Square.  This was long unused, but served for a while as a Presbyterian Church under Rev. W. Davidson.  The discovery of copper at Moonta and Wallaroo caused the migration of many from Burra and all three Methodist Churches were weakened and attendance fell further when the mine closed.  Ultimately all three combined in the Methodist Union [1900].
