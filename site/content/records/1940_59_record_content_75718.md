Characteristics of the 1956 paper.

Page 1

Local news, covering the area from Terowie, Spalding, Hill Town and south to Black Springs and Robertstown.  A couple of medium sized advertisements.

Pages 2 & 3

These are largely advertising, dominated by stock sales, real estate and clearance sales, public notices, small advertisements and entertainment.  Births, deaths and marriages are rare.

Some news, mainly sports results, may appear on page 3 and page three also has some large local advertisements.  The balance between the above components fluctuates considerably.

Pages 4-8

The layout of the rest of the paper was not very regular.

Of the six columns on each page, large advertisements commonly took up four to six and news one to two.  On one of these pages there was commonly no news; its place being taken by a ‘Cash Column’ basically small classified-type advertisements.  In the football season reports of the local teams took up at least one page in aggregate.

In general the paper gave a fair coverage of local events, but considerable space was devoted to the outlying parts of the district and errors in setting are not uncommon.  While coverage may have been good, attention to detail seems to have slipped.  Sports results sometimes seem sloppy with scores incomplete or wrong and reports sometimes confused or missing in part.

Supplements are quite rare, but on a few occasions there are ten rather than eight pages.
