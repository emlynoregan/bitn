Obituary.  Hartley Harris, formerly of Burra, died in Melbourne 9 February aged 84.  He was a son of the late Frank Harris and left Burra in 1923, keeping up a subscription to the Burra Record ever since.  His first job about seventy years ago was with the Burra Record at 5/- a week.  After two years he went to Adelaide and entered the grocery trade.  In the Great War he saw service at Gallipoli and in France, after which he married and returned to Burra to be employed as a grocer by Drew & Crewes.  In 1923 he went to Lilydale in Victoria to an apple orchard and dairy farm.  With difficult times and the onset of the Great Depression he returned to grocery, where he remained until he retired.  For the last 25 years he lived in the Melbourne suburb of Reservoir.  He is survived by his son Bruce and his brother Arthur, now of Adelaide.  He spent his last three months at the McLeod Repatriation Hospital.  The occupant of an adjacent bed was another man who spent his early years in Burra; Mr Peter Gebhardt.  [Hartley Pascoe Harris born 10 August 1890 Kooringa.
