Market Square

D. Rayfield said: ‘The historic nature of Market Square is no more.’ after seeing the square earlier on Tuesday.  Work had recommenced on the Square on Friday morning following Thursday’s confrontation between protesters and council workers.  About 30 protesters were there again, but additional police had been brought in from Pt Pirie, Spalding, Hallett and Pt Augusta.  Police removed a bus that had been parked on the disputed Median strip and a tractor also illegally parked to disrupt work.  The protesters staged a passive protest.  Mr Rayfield described Friday as disastrous.  He had hoped that unofficial talks between the parties involved might take place earlier this week, but that had not occurred.
