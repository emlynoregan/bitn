William Henry March turned 79 on 2 April.  He came to Burra when aged 3 with his parents.  His father was a shepherd.  His first job was to mind sheep for Mr O’Leary, butcher of Burra.  He shepherded sheep around the hills of Burra, bringing them in at night.  He did this for six or seven years.  He then went to work for Isaac Chivel where Mr W. Finch’s farm now is.  He worked there for 25 years, driving a milk cart in the mornings and doing general farm work in a 14-hour working day.  He then became a van driver for Alex Harris who had a shop near the Kooringa Hotel and after several years started cab driving from the Burra Railway Station.  He then drove the Eastern Mail for 12 years and worked on the property of Mr I.J. Warnes.  He was for over 40 years a member of the Foresters Lodge and a handicapper for athletic events.  He had also been a Town Councillor.  [He represented East Ward from December 1931 to November 1933 & from July 1940 to June 1941.]
