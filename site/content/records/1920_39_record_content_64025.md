School Days 1870-1874

I spent four happy years under the tuition of the late Mrs F.J. White who was a strict, but kind mistress and as I learnt readily and was a good memory, lessons had no terrors for me.  Our girls’ school was situated in a large room on the west side of the house now occupied by Mrs G. Hann, a long porch accommodating our cloaks, hats and school bags.  The boys’ school was a large building at the back of the house and their playground was a large open space in the front of the house.  Our playground was on the hill on the opposite side of the house.  The boys’ playground was often the scene of much excitement, especially when football and cricket were in.  Cries of ‘go it Bruey’, Go it Hoppity Kick’, ‘run it Aughy’ would rend the air accompanied by hand claps and jigs of various kinds.  To me it was often more fun to watch the boys than play with the girls.  Our games were quieter, except in marbles time, when sometimes excitement ran high.  Two of our girls were born reciters and Annie Ellery and Susan Jane Thomas would keep the whole of us entertained with Cornish recitations, such as ‘When the Minister came to tea’, ‘Grammer’s Cat and Ours’, etc.

Hetty Symonds, an exceptionally good reader of the Cornish Dialect passed away in her twelfth year.  She was a bright merry girl and loved by us all.
