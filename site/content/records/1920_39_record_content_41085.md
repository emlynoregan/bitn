Elected: President, C.R. Sexton; Vice-Presidents, L.M. Gordon & H.J.B. Jennison; Hon. Secretary, G.H. Dow & Treasurer M.G. Dobson.  The meeting carried a resolution calling on the Government to investigate the disabilities under which soldier settlers were working and to treat each case on its merits rather than collectively.  The main difficulties cited were the low prices for primary products, high and inflated land values and high interest rates.  An annual ball will be held in 1932 at a date to be fixed.
