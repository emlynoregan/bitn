Buffalo Lodge Christmas Tree will be held 19 December and a large crowd of youngsters and wives of members is expected.  Over 160 gifts have been purchased and Father Christmas will have a busy time distributing them.  There is a rumour that there is to be a presentation of some ‘Buffalo Debutantes’ who have been in strict straining (sorry, training) in order to fit into their gowns.
