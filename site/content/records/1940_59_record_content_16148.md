Salvation Army.  Whilst in Adelaide last week Capt. Cox was appointed Commanding Officer of the Burra Corps.  He had been acting as such for 8 weeks.  Among other activities, she has started a Youth Movement which has attracted new members and she is an energetic and helpful officer.

The Youth Section held a hike to the Burra Station and back on Friday night.

Crows in their hundreds have descended on Mongolata and cleaned up a minor plague of grasshoppers there according to a report from Jim Schwier.

Red Tape.  J.V. Lord of Pine Valley Station recently needed a spark plug urgently for the engine used to pump water for stock.  He was instead sent certain forms to be filled out before he could be supplied.  We understand he was able to surmount his difficulties by other means before red tape left the sheep to perish.

Burra District Boys in London have visited the Boomerang Club and SA House.  They include PO H. McWaters (Burra), WO H.H. Woodgate (Booborowie) & FO A. Parry (Hallett).  They are all well and send greetings to friends & relatives.
