Tree Planting

Burra will be included in a state-wide greening and re-afforestation program.  It is part of the latest 58 Community Employment Program Projects of SA and will provide 238 jobs for an average of 21 weeks at a total cost of $2.8 million.  Most projects are in the Adelaide Metropolitan Area, but Burra joins the other country areas of Meadows, Gawler, Kanmantoo, Pt Lincoln and Snowtown.
