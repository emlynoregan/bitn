Obituary.  Mr Michael Breen, formerly the Secretary/Manager of the Burra Hospital and Secretary of the Burra Racing Club, has died in Auckland New Zealand.  He resigned from these positions in the latter part of 1960 to return to Norfolk Island.  He had just arrived ‘home’ and was settling in when death occurred.  Earlier he had been Secretary of the Woomera Town Board for 8 years, retiring in 1958 from a position like that of a town mayor, town clerk, editor of the local paper Gibber-Gabber, supervisor of civic amenities, registrar of burials and curator of the cemetery.  He held a BEc, BA and Dip. Public Administration from Sydney University.  Mr H. Foote said Mr Breen loved his pet galah and paid a large sum of money to get it to New Zealand, but on arrival was advised that because of some technicality it could not land and he had to leave it with the coxswain of the boat.
