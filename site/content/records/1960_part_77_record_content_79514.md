Hallett Centenary

In 1977 Hallett will celebrate 100 years of local government. Oddly, due to an oversight, Hallett has never been proclaimed a town.  A meeting was held on 23 June to formulate a program for the Centenary Celebrations.  [The suggestions are printed.]  A further meeting is scheduled for 14 October when sub-committees will report to the public.
