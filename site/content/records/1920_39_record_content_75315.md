A Man Hunt ‘Out East’

A NSW car thief is being chased through the eastern stations.  The chase has extended from Ketchowla through to Mutooroo since last Tuesday.  The thief has eluded capture so far by avoiding main tracks and cutting fences and also by cutting telephone lines to stop communications.  A woman who was with him has parted company with him and we understand was found at Salt Bush Dam.
