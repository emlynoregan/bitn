St Mary’s, Burra.  Renovations to the exterior are progressing well.  Last week a window from the original St Mary’s was uncovered after being hidden for more than 80 years behind the pipe organ.

St Mary’s new pipe organ was played at services and concerts last Sunday.

( Burra Record 18 Oct. 1905, Page 5) Harold Davies, Mus. Doc. was engaged for the day.]

The window was dedicated in 1873 and is in reasonably good condition.  When repaired it will be hung and illuminated.
