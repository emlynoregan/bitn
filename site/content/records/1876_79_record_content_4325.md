Show Society. Adjourned AGM reported on 1877. The ploughing match held on 16 Aug. with prizes amounting to £20. The show of stock on 12 Sept. was at the yards of the E. & A.C. Co. at Redruth. The only problem was the narrow means of communication between the two yards used. This will have to be obviated if the site is to be used again. The grant-in-aid of only £37-0-l1 led to a decision not to stage a show of fruit, grain and flowers etc. in a large room in the town, but it is hoped to do so with the stock show next year. F.W. Holder was elected Chairmen at Annual Meeting 21 June 1878. For the next year the President was re-elected; the Vice-Presidents were Capt. Killicoat & H. Dawson; Treasurer, Mr Rosman of the National Bank; Sec. J.D. Cave. There was a committee of 40 which included F.W. Holder. It was proposed to use the E & A Copper Co. Yards for 1878.
