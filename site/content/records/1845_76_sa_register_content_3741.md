Resident Magistrate’s Court Kooringa, 13 July, before W. Lane, Police Commissioner.

[Is this an error for W. Lang, Resident Magistrate?]

The inconveniently small room was crammed almost to suffocation to hear the case of John Jones, a note pugilist, who was charged by John Ryan with assault and robbery.

Ryan appeared to be severely injured about the head and face.  He deposed that he resided at Kooringa and on Sunday 8 July he had gone to Emu Springs, some 14 miles from Kooringa.  When he was about to return home the accused seized his bridle and refused to let him go until he had him and his friends to grog.  Ryan agreed and ordered the landlord to give Jones a bottle of brandy.  As Ryan left Jones then followed him and when out of sight of the house he dragged Ryan from the horse, beat him severely and then stole a silver watch, a shilling and a black silk handkerchief.

Bridget Lynch, a servant at Emu Springs, said Ryan was there on 8 July and so was Jones.  She had seen the silver watch in Ryan’s possession, but had not seen Jones follow him.  After a while Ryan’s horse returned riderless.  She went out and found Ryan insensible.

Thomas Tapley, landlord of the ‘Emu Springs’ gave evidence essentially confirming the above and said he and another man had gone out and collected Ryan after Bridget Lynch had reported him lying insensible.  Ryan had been ‘rather intoxicated’ when he left the hotel.

Jones deposed that he had been at the hotel, had left, and returned because he had broken a bottle of grog and came back to get another.  The road to his house was in a different direction from Ryan’s and he did not know anything about the robbery.

Jones was committed for trial.
