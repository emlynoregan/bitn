Adelaide Wool Sales.  Messrs Radford Bros of Canegrass Station obtained 124d per lb and topped the market except for one small offering at 125d.  This is the highest price ever seen for wool from saltbush country.  Competition at the sale was keen and the clearance was excellent.

[Other district prices are printed.]
