P.L. Rosman Hon. Secretary of the Bowling Club said that Mr W.H. Sandland owned the old Bible Christian Church site and was prepared to exchange it for the Council Depot next to the bowling green in the interests of the Bowling Club.  It would be an improvement for the town, as they would put two lawn tennis courts on the Depot site.
