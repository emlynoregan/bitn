River Murray Floods

A very big flood in the River Darling is moving towards the Murray.  Readings at Bourke reached 45’ 1” on 1 March compared with 46 ft in the big flood of 1950.  Stations downstream have exceeded the 1950 levels because the Warrego enters below Bourke.  Menindie is recording 31’ 8” and rising.  The 1950 peak of 32’ 4” seems likely to be exceeded.  Below Wentworth almost all locks are fully open and levels are set to rise.
