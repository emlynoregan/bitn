Burra Town Council, 16 June

SAR says nothing can be done about the Station Road until after 30 June.

Road signs from the Vacuum Oil Co. have come to hand.

Deputation from the RSL led by H.G. Oates & Dr Steele concerning the guns.

Mr Oates said they had come neither with demands nor cap in hand, but with some suggestions.  If these were not followed then he hoped the Council would take steps to preserve these interesting relics of war.  When they arrived they were greeted with acclaim, but today they are being allowed to deteriorate.  The recent AGM had expressed a view that they should be returned to the square to be mounted on a low mound between the Rotunda and the Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial.  While some individual diggers opposed this they were not representative of the RSL.  Dr Steele felt that the diggers had been overlooked in making the decision.  He then gave a résumé of the history of the guns.  Had there been any funds to carry out the original scheme this question may never have arisen.  A plan devised when Mr Collins was Mayor came to nothing because the Mayor thought the funds would not be forthcoming.  The subsequent move of the Council ignored the committee of Council and RSL which had ceased to function.  It was undertaken quickly and without consultation.  He thought they should not have been moved.  Such weapons he thought would thrill rather than horrify those to come.  Matters such as the guns came to mean more as the men got older.  The RSL President Mr Oates said the League would be prepared to help in the cost involved.

Cr Kellaway moved the site suggested by inspected and costs be gone into.  Carried 4 to 2.
