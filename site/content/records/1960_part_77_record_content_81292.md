The Season.  Although the season has improved in the last few weeks the stateâ€™s wheat crop is likely to be less than half the ten year average, but barley will be almost 80% of the ten-year average.  Up to 50% of sheep and cattle have been moved from the lower rainfall areas to the cereal belt, either for agistment or slaughter.
