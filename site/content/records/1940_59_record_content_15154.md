Obituary.  Return Thanks notice reveals the death of Fanny Smith of Booborowie, evidently at Burra Hospital.  [Fanny Smith, born Threadgold, died 18 September 1943 at Burra, residence Booborowie aged 79.  At marriage her father is cited as Anselm Threadgold who was certainly a Burra resident, but the only registered birth of a Fanny Threadgold has a father called Henry.  Anselm has three children registered, but none is Fanny.  Nevertheless the death of her mother and other evidence suggests she was this Fanny born 26 March 1863 at Stanley Flat.  See Obituary next page of this issue for another variation.]
