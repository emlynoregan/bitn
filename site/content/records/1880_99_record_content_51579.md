Golden Wedding.  Last Sunday the Golden Wedding of Heinrich Christian Wilhelm Fuss and Freideriche Christiana Fuss was celebrated.  They were married at Neustatt, Harzburg, Germany, on 22 October 1843.  They migrated to Australia four years later in the Hermann Von Beckeratt.  On reaching Burra Mr Fuss became a miner, but was soon promoted to sole charge of the smelting works charge yard, where he mixed the first and the last charge for the furnace.  He has 44 grandchildren and 1 great grandchild.  He is a most successful gardener and when Burra could boast annual floricultural shows Mr Fuss was the principal prize-taker.  Even at the present time he takes great interest in gardening operations and his clean neat beds of flowers are admired by everyone.  In addition to this he spends much time reading.  He had six sons and two daughters, all of whom are married.  Mr Fuss is 77 and his wife 76 and both are in excellent health.  After the suspension of work at the smelting yards Mr Fuss did a little farming at Springbank for a few years, but he subsequently retired from that operation and has since led a retired life.
