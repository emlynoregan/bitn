Fire.  On 23 December a fire similar to the great fire of 1919 broke out.  The day was a typical ‘brickfielder’ with a strong west wind.  By the time the news reached Burra the fire had already swept from Canowie to Willalo.  Almost none of the homesteads seem to have taken precautions.  James Phillips’ ‘Yarra Glen’ was one of the few with a fire break around it and though not much, it sufficed to save the house.  Motorists and others had to cut fences to escape into the fallow or lucerne in the gusty wind.  Many settlers had to flee their homes and spent hours in fallow fields swept with ashes, smoke and dust.  Andrew Bartholomaeus, an aged gentleman Burra resident only escaped by jumping into a water trough.  [This was amended next issue to read ‘Andrew Bartholomaeus and an aged gentleman’.]  A son of T. Jeffery of Willalo is recovering from burns in the Burra Hospital after returning through flames to rescue an aunt he mistakenly thought was still in the house.

It Started about one mile south of Canowie, ran through some of W.E. Hannaford’s ‘The Bluff’ destroying 1,150 acres of grass and 75 acres of lucerne, 150 tons of lucerne hay, shearing sheds, motor sheds, stables and equipment, but his livestock, all vehicles and 75 acres of lucerne were saved.  The fire burnt a corner of Cappeedee Run before going on to Willalo where the heavy losses were sustained by T. Jeffery, K.P. Sawers, E. Glover, J. Madigan, J.P. Cousins, S. Brooks, B. Mannion, B.H. Henriks, J.N. & J.S. McInerney, F.C. Catt, James Murphy, F. Phillips, Mr Millard, Mr Guthrie & Mrs K. Phillips.  Homesteads were saved.  All feed on the stock road was burnt – the only commonage for dairy cattle.  From Booborowie to Copperhouse equipment was dragged into fallow or lucerne paddocks along with vehicles.  Fortunately rain fell a little after 5 p.m. and though it was not much it, with a wind change to a southerly, extinguished the fire.  [The report does not mention the loss of any houses.]

The correspondent from Hallett says the fire started from sparks from a chimney fire at the Canowie Post Office.  [Though the date given in that report is Christmas Eve] This report says it reached an area between South Booborowie and Spalding when the rain fell.
