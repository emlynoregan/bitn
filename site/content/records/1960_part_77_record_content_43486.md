Obituary.  William Joseph Lee was born at Marrabel 13 January 1883 and moved with his family to live at World’s End when 13 years old.  He began school at Marrabel and finished it at World’s End.  He then became a blacksmith and farrier’s apprentice at Riverton and later came to Burra to work for the late Sam Burns for 11 years.  When that business closed he worked for Mr Max Morton, after which he went into business on his own and retired after about 20 years.  In 1909 he married Miss Julia Barrow.  He became a member of the Foresters’ Lodge in 1911 and was its secretary for many years, retiring from the position at 80 years of age.  He became a member of the Kooringa Masonic Lodge in 1929 and was Grand Master [sic: for Worshipful Master] in 1945.  He became a member of the Grand Lodge in 1960.  He was a member of the Burra Brass Band, Burra Institute Library and foreman of the Burra Fire Brigade for several years.  He is survived by a wife and children: Cliff (Kalgoorlie), Ilene Mrs Campbell (Burra), Robert (Charters Towers, Qld), Ron (Townsville, Qld), Joyce Mrs D. Pexton (Poolaijelo, Victoria) and Phyllis Mrs McWaters (Melbourne).  [Died 27 November 1968 Burra.]
