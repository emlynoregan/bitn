Smelts Chimney Demolished

The chimney finally fell at c. 1.15 p.m. last Saturday after considerable effort and blasting equipment.  Messrs C.P. Thamm & Sons of Burra North did the job on behalf of Mr J.G. Carpenter, on whose property it stood.  Over a number of years the Council has demanded its demolition because of the danger to children playing around its base.  Originally it was believed to be about 100 ft high, but according to measurements taken on Saturday it had fallen away to 70 ft.  For years it belched smoke when the smelts were active, but for many years now the furnaces have been cold and the chimney has been the home to thousands of pigeons.  About three years ago preparations were made to demolish the chimney and some 200 bags of pigeon manure were then removed.  Now Mr Thamm said there would be practically as much in the base of the ruins.  When the Smelts began there was a low chimney with a short draft and a good proportion of the copper was being lost.  The company then got the services of a German engineer who built a higher chimney, fed by a draft tunnel of about 100 yards.  The base of the chimney was 14 ft square and the foundations are about 10 ft deep with the base walls being 3 ft 6 inches thick.  The bricks inside the base were a special fire resistant brick made from a white kaolin.  All these are particularly hard and stood up to the elements well.  Some of them are branded as being made in 1846.  The kaolin is believed to have come from a plastic kaolin deposit at ‘Motherall’s’ 18 miles east of Burra.  The red bricks came from brick kilns in the Burra creek near the cemetery.

Demolition commenced on Saturday morning when considerable effort was needed to drill holes in the base to take the charges.  A portion of the southern base was blown out and then the northern.  A part of the east wall followed, leaving only the western side solid and the corners on the south and north-eastern sides.  Both the corners had to be blow out before it fell.  It fell to the earth before breaking up and landed with an enormous explosive sound and sent up a mushroom-like cloud of black dust.  Pigeons flew out as it fell and some emerged from the debris, but some died in their resting place of many years.  Many of the bricks were broken, but thousands remain in perfect condition. A goodly number of these will, in the near future, find their way into additions to the residence of Mr Thamm.  An estimated 1-2 tons of one inch square iron bars were used to reinforce the chimney.
