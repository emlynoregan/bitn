Obituary.  Herbert Cox died at Burra Hospital on 4 May.  He had been born in Burra 17 July 1874 and was the eldest son of the late Mr & Mrs Edward Cox.  He was educated at Burra, after which he was employed by his father in the saddlery business.  Later he went to Adelaide for further experience in his trade and worked for three years for Messrs Holden and Frost.  Whilst there he helped to make much military equipment for the Boer War.  When his father died, he returned to Burra and carried on the business.  He later sold this to Mr S.M. Lane, but remained in Mr Lane’s employment for many years, until he had to retire due to failing health.  In 1896 he married Miss Edith Mary Clode, also of Burra, who predeceased him in 1932.

In his younger days his main sporting interest was coursing and he was a keen member of the Burra Coursing Club.  He was also a member of the Burra show Society and active in the poultry and flower sections.  He bred many fine birds and won many prizes for his exhibits.  He was a member of the Oddfellows’ Lodge and in his time held high offices in that body.  He leaves five sons: Edward (Woodville), Vincent (Kapunda), Frank (Balaklava), Melvin & Arth (2nd AIF) and six daughters, Eileen, Mrs N. Donaldson (Cunliffe), Jean, Mrs Manning (St Kilda Victoria), Amy, Mrs G. Reynolds, (Yarcowie), Edith, Mrs Siviour (Cummins) and Lorna, Mrs Ken James (Burra North).  There are 22 grandchildren and 2 great grandchildren.
