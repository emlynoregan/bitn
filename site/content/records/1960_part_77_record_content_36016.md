Lutheran Church.  The amalgamation of the United Evangelical Lutheran Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church became effective on 1 January 1967.  Parishes have been re-aligned and congregations united where both churches existed in the same town.  An amalgamation took place between Clare and Blyth.  As a result a number of churches were closed.  In SA fifteen closed in January.  Some of the closed churches became halls, some were sold to other denominations and some that were moveable were transferred to areas where no Lutheran congregations existed.  Yesterday morning a timber-framed asbestos church 44 ft by 18 ft plus the front porch was moved by Low Loaders Ltd from Hansen [sic] Road Woodville Gardens to Burra.  It arrived in good shape and was positioned on a block of land on the corner of Morehead Street and the road leading to the old Reformatory.  [Actually the corner of Ludgvan and Tregony Streets.]  Two men managed to unload and set the building in position in four hours.  Furnishings had already been redistributed, so the Burra congregation is seeking necessary items from other closed churches and some fine donations have already been received.  The Burra congregation numbers only about twenty at present and is part of the Clare-Blyth Parish served by Pastor H.H. Schmidt of Blyth.  Services are held fortnightly and up ti now have been in St Mary’s Parish Hall.  The new building should be ready for use in about eight weeks.
