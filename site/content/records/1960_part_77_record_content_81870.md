Bence’s Ltd Drapery & Clothing Store has changed hands after operating for 56 years.  Proprietor-Manager Mr Len Bence has conducted the business since the early 1960s following the retirement of the late Arthur and Olive Bence.  Arthur started life in Burra as an auctioneer, holding sales of furniture and sundry items.  This followed a period of trading in the Solomon Islands around 1913.  He saw active service in Egypt and France in 1916.  He also travelled around the eastern country selling goods and was soon able to start Bence’s Ltd, which has flourished ever since.*  The first sale at the Burra Auction Mart was advertised on 7 September 1927.*  The editor commented that it should be a boon to many people.  By 1924 the columns of the Record were advertising Bence’s Cash Drapery Store.  The store has kept its doors open through hard times and times of plenty.

Now Mr Len Bence intends to devote more of his time to a life-long interest in painting.  Many of his fine works already adorn the walls of homes in the area.  Len and Muriel intend to stay on in Burra.  The new proprietor is Mr Arnold Earnshaw who intends to carry on business with the same staff and will trade under the name of Bence’s.  He previously had a similar business at Leigh Creek and has been associated with the trade for many years, including the management of several of C.J. Coles’ Variety Stores.

[*Some of these dates and statements are not quite true.  The following references from the Burra Record may clarify the history of the enterprise:

XXXXIII, 35, 31 Aug. 1921, page 2: Advt.  A.L. Bence (late AIF) Auctioneer & Commission Agent sets up the Burra Auction Mart opposite Eyes & Crowle’s in Commercial St.  Furniture, Poultry and all classes of goods every Friday from 9 September.

XXXXIV, 38, 20 Sep. 1922, page 3: Advt.  ‘Bon March’  Burra’s new shop will be opened by A.L. Bence in that portion of the Auction Mart previously occupied by Mr Woollacott on 21 September.

XXXXV, 4, 24 Jan. 1923, page 3: A.L. Bence will be moving into the premises formerly occupied by Miss Snell and will open the shop as a general cash drapery store with occasional auction sales.
