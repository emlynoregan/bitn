Extension of the Gawler Railway

The Surveyor General has produced a report on estimates and traffic returns on a proposed railway Gawler to Kapunda and Kapunda to Blanchetown.

Four lines for northern extension railways have been considered:

The Wakefield Route: to Pinkerton’s Flat, the River Light, by that river to Salter’s Creek, the River Wakefield to auburn, Mintaro and the head of Gum Creek to Burra.

The Gilbert Route, as above to the Light, by Ayliffe’s, Forrester’s and Saddleworth, to the headwaters of the Gilbert, by the large lagoon and the head of Gum Creek to Burra.

Kapunda Route: to Kapunda, Ross’s Creek, the head of Allen’s Creek, Hamilton, up the Dirty Light and Tothill’s Creek, Logan’s Flat and the Burra Creek to Burra.

Taking option 3 to Tothill’s Creek and then via the head of the Dirty Light to the large Lagoon to Burra.

For the Murray Extension:

From Burra by Baldina Creek to North West Bend.

From the River Light southwest of Kapunda by St Kitt’s Creek and Camp Creek to Blanchetown.

From Gawler by Greenock Creek, Angus Park and Truro to Moorundee.

From Gawler to Sandy Creek, towards Tanunda.

From Adelaide by the Torrens, One Tree Hill Creek and the Thirty-nine Sections.

The route recommended is a combination of the Kapunda and Gilbert routes.  It passes close to the Kapunda mining district and the Karkulto mining property.  It is easily reached for most of its length by good natural roads and could be extended north of Burra for perhaps 120 miles without difficulty.  Agricultural land lies on either side of it.

Option 2 is the recommended one for the Murray extension.  It would pass through one of the finest agricultural districts in the colony.  [Captain Freeling says he considers the choices made by the engineers Messrs Harvey & Murray are very good after he had looked at the options himself and looked at a numbering of levelling reports.]

Mr Hanson’s estimate that the extension to Kapunda would yield 4½% is conservative.

A line to Kapunda would capture the Burra traffic and this in turn would mean that the need for a main line of road from Burra to Port Wakefield would cease to exist.  Some £2,348 has already been expended on this 55 mile route.  It is also proposed to spend £1,750 in 1857 just to get around some crossing places.  As the land along this road gets sold and fenced, the road across the Wakefield Plains will probably become impassable in winter unless metalled. The cost would be very high and would be saved by the railway to Kapunda.  This railway would also save on the roads north of Gawler to Clare and to Burra.  The first ten miles north of Gawler are particularly difficult, with reactive soils and the need to bring in stone from a distance.

[Estimates of traffic on the line are then printed and the total is estimated at 20,000 tons.]
