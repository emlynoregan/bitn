The Burra Parliamentary Club

At a meeting of the members of the Burra Institute on 13 March 1876, convened by Mr W.H. Rosman, it was resolved that a club be formed to be called the Burra Parliamentary Club.  Its object would be the discussion in a proper Parliamentary form of the leading topics of the day.

The formation of the first Ministry was entrusted to Mr J.D. Cave and resulted as follows:

Premier and Attorney General	J.D. Cave

Chief Secretary	W.H. Rosman

Commissioner of Crown Lands	J.R. Stephens

Treasurer	T. Drew

Commissioner of Public Works	H. Dawson

Minister of Education	H.A. Holthouse

Acting Governor	G.W. Goodhardt

Speaker	W.R. Ridgway

Clerk	T. Rosman

Sergeant-at-Arms	H. Mosarr

Messenger	W. Dyer

[The article then follows the progress of the club at some length.]

The Acting Governor opened Parliament on 17 March and on 23 March the Premier introduced his policies.  He proposed narrow gauge railways from Pt Augusta north, and Gladstone to Jamestown and broad gauge extensions from Burra to Terowie and Kapunda to Morgan.  Contractors would be encouraged to import their own labour.  He proposed an income and property tax.

F.W. Holder became Leader of the Opposition, which included E. Lipsett, J. Drew, W. West, R. Sanders and P. Lane.

There was apparently a change of government because the article continues with a report of the Government headed by F. Holder  presenting its policy on 23 May.
