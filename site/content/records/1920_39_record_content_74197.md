He took an active interest in sports, social activities and church.  He was a valued officer of the Redruth Methodist Church and a member of the Ironmine Church.  He married Elsie, eldest daughter of Mrs & the late Mr H. Motherall of Kooringa on 13 December 1916 at Hanson Methodist Church.  A widow, three sons and one daughter survive: Mr Bob White, Miss Mavis White and Masters Don & Ross White.  He leaves three brothers and two sisters: Messrs Arthur, Rub & Leslie White and Mesdames Degnan and Vale of Hyde Park.  The funeral on Sunday was largely attended with 137 cars in the procession.  Rev. J.A.H. Andrews (Redruth) and Rev. J.P.H. Tilbrook (Kooringa) both returned from conference for the funeral.  Bro. E.S. Blunt read the Oddfellows Service.
