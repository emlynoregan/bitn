Seventh War Loan.  To help in raising funds for this loan the ‘Haig’ tank arrived in Burra on Monday.  It greatly impressed those who assembled in Market Square when it drew up at 4.30.  The Ladies’ band attended and rendered a selection.  The Mayor delivered an address from the tank.  The target for Burra & District was a huge £50,000.  [This appears to have been based in some way on previous donations to patriotic causes.]  Promises so far had reached £7,000.  Hallett had subscribed £8,000, or £3,000 over their target and £2,800 had been subscribed at Mt Bryan.  Up to date the response has seen the amount promised rise to £20,020.
