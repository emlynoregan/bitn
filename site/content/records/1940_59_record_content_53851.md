Burra Hospital is faced with a mounting overdraft and medical staff shortages.  The staff shortages confront all subsidised and private hospitals.  The overdraft on 18 January was £4,832-4-3.

Patient fees from 18 January to last Friday	615-11-1

Government benefits		175-4-0

Subsidies		     45-18-9

Total		836-13-10

Costs for the same period:

Wages		756-13-6

Food		   498-8-9

Total		1,255-2-3

The overdraft is now £5,250-12-8, after payment of several hundred pounds of donations.

This problem applies to virtually all hospitals, and cannot continue.  The Government is about to spend £380,000 on a hospital at Pt Lincoln.  Why, we ask, when it already ahs an adequate hospital and the sum would liquidate the overdraft accounts of all the hospitals across the state.
