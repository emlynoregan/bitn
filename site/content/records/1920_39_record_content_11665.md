Obituary.  A.J. Cousins of Booborowie died at his residence 28 September leaving a wife and grown up family.  The funeral on Sunday had to contend with driving wind and snow etc.  The cortege comprised 22 buggies and 11 motor cars.  [Born Andrew Cousins 23 April 1872 at Kooringa: died as Andrew Joseph Cousins 28 September 1923 at Booborowie.]

A.J. Cousinsâ€™ Funeral was a most unenviable experience due to the appalling weather.  On Sunday when the hearse arrived at Booborowie snow was falling heavily.  The cortege left for Burra, twenty miles away, at 9.30 a.m. and had to endure snow and then fiercely driving hail and rain.  22 buggies and 11 motor cars took part.  Twice the horses stopped and refused to face the elements.  In all, the journey took five hours.  Amazingly to the east of Burra the country is still enveloped in dust with no rain of significance having fallen.  The undertakers with this difficult job were C.J. Pearce & Son.
