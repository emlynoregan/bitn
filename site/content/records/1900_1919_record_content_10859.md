Burra Town Council, Monday

The Hydraulic Engineer advises that unless the Council is willing to take over the public water troughs and pay for the water at 2/- per 1,000 gallons the water will be cut off.

W. Geake applied for an additional ½ pint of oil for the arc lamp.  He will be told the matter will be reconsidered when the lamp works more successfully.

C.C. Heinrich of the Burra Hotel has offered to supply the town with [gas for?] five acetylene lamps from his plant for £52 p.a.  The necessary material to be supplied at the expense of the Corporation.  The run of gas not to exceed to the Institute, Henderson’s Bridge and the bridge near Dr Sangster’s.

The offer was not entertained.

A petition asked for provision of some sort of protection at the Bon Accord crossing.  It will be forwarded to the district MPs.

A letter will be sent to the Hydraulic Engineer asking for one public trough free.
