Burra Town Council, 8 May

Mr W. Marshall lessee of the Aberdeen Quarry inquired if there had been any response to the deputation concerning the use of metal from the quarry.  There had not.

The dog nuisance in the town continues, but no one is interested in the position of dog-catcher.

Another letter will be sent to the SAR on the poor state of the Station Road.

Following a series of test call-outs for the Fire Brigade the Councillors resolved to send a letter to headquarters asking that in future such practice calls be kept to one locality.  They were afraid they needlessly disturbed the public and would lead to a situation where the cry of ‘Wolf’ would be heard once too often.
