Bitumen Road.  It seems clear from the Minister for Local Government’s statement that we cannot expect a bituminised road to Burra for some years.   There are, he says, ‘authorised works of greater urgency.’  We wonder what they are, considering that this is a main artery to the north and the main highway to Broken Hill.
