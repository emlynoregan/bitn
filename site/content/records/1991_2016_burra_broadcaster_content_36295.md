Accident.  On Wednesday 30 March at 6.45 a.m. a fuel tanker carrying c. 23,000 litres of unleaded petrol and diesel rolled over onto its side in Copperhouse Street, Burra, and as a result the road was closed from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. that day and several nearby houses were evacuated because of the leaking fuel.  The driver sustained minor shoulder injuries.  MFS, CFS and SES crews were all involved.  A recovery unit from Adelaide attended to transfer the fuel to another tanker and a crane came from Clare to recover the prime mover and trailer, damage to which was estimated at c. $200,000.
