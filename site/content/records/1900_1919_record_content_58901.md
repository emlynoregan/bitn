Mr McBride was elected.

(Other members were Messrs Bartholomaeus, Warnes, Dane, Crewes, McLaren, Radford, Winnall, McWaters, Dr Williams and the new members: Major L.A. Lewis & Mr Ruthven.)[[

[Mr Lane seems to have resigned.]

[The last meeting of the old Board had gone into committee to discuss certain matters, which were of course not able then to be reported in the paper.  It now becomes clear that the complaints from nurses had resulted in that meeting in committee asking the Matron to resign.]

The two probationers concerned had asked to be allowed to resign and this request was granted.

Mr Winnall was against the drastic action proposed by the committee and especially in the present condition of the town [a reference to influenza].  No steps had been taken to fill vacancies generated by the decision.

Mr McWaters held that the carrying out of the decision was in Mr Winnall’s hands.

Winnall [who apparently had taken no action to implement the decision] held that the committee should also have taken action to fill the vacancy created.  He was solidly against the decision to dismiss the Matron after three years of faithful service without the breath of a complaint.  He was against the adoption of the minutes, which would see them implemented.  He was glad that Nurse Cranston had come and gone after complaining about the Matron and her management of the hospital.

Mr Crewes & Mr McWaters held that the new members should not vote, not having heard the evidence.

Mr Winnall was determined not to have the institution’s future controlled by the word of two probationers.  He said it amounted to two probationers saying that if the Matron were not dismissed they would leave: it was laughable if it had not proved tragical. [sic]

Mr Crewes thought that the probationers had proved their case.

Mr Winnall would use his last breath to see the injustice undone.  Boiled down to its essentials Nurse Birdseye’s greatest complaint was a shortage of utensils.

The Matron replied that as breakages were often not reported, she did not always know of the shortages.

The other serious complaint was that the Matron, one night, refused to come and help her move a patient and the patient had to wait two hours till Nurse Hermann came on duty.  Nurse Birdseye’s version of events was uncorroborated.

[Winnall then goes on a flight of fancy constructing a scenario he believed more likely to be what happened, but which is equally uncorroborated.]

After further statements by Winnall he moved that the minutes be not adopted.  2nd Warnes.

Mr McWaters considered this all a schoolboy-like action – to consider the matter carefully for two days and arrive at a decision and then come again and have all that had been done thrown to one side and not recognised.  He had come ready to support the carrying out of the decision and intended to do so.

When the motion was put Ruthven, McLaren, Warnes, Winnall & Lewis were for it and Bartholomaeus, Radford, McWaters, Dane & Crewes were opposed.

Carried on the casting vote of the chair.

Mr Crewes moved that the Matron be discharged.

He was astounded that a member of the minority had planned to overthrow the decision of the majority.  Why hold an enquiry at all?  The business had been settled and at a subsequent meeting a decision reached was being cast out without any new evidence being brought.

Messrs Winnall & Crewes then went over the alleged incident of the 23rd when the Matron was held to have refused to aid a patient.

Mr Winnall had taken offence at the way the nurses’ letters were worded.  Mr Crewes thought they were incorrectly worded through ignorance and some of their complaints were supported by charge-nurse Cranston, whom he regarded as a fine woman.  He felt their actions in now not carrying out a decision of the Board would make them a laughing stock of the community.

Dr Williams was asked whether the nurse should have been able to move the patient without help and he agreed she should have been able.  Mr Dane 2nd Mr Crewes.

On being put the motion was lost – the split in votes being as before.

The Matron is to be advised that the request for her resignation was withdrawn.

The Secretary of the ATNA wrote cancelling the hospital’s registration as a school for training nurses due to low patient numbers.  Enquiries are to be made re the status of nurses admitted as probationers before the cancellation.

Inspector General of Hospitals is to be advised that Burra Hospital had not reduced its fees as alleged by Dr Ashton, to compete with his new private hospital.

D. Jones tender was accepted to paint the morgue.

It was advisable for all hospital staff to be inoculated for influenza.
