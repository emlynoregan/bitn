Redruth & Aberdeen

‘Not Borrowed Plumes’ writes to correct the paper’s correspondent who reported great quantities of wheat coming into Kooringa.  ‘He must mean Aberdeen.’  Despite having been in competition over the years, Redruth and Aberdeen, unitedly, are becoming a place of importance thanks to the efforts of Messrs Tiver, Ridgway, Pearce, Dawson, Roach, Butterworth and others.  They have spent large sums in building handsome business premises and homes.

Kooringa, 20 July.

A complimentary dinner was given at the Aberdeen Hotel to H.J. Hood by young men of Kooringa and Aberdeen.  About 30 sat down to an excellent spread prepared by Host Orchard.  Mr W. Barker of Baldina presided.  The meeting was to farewell Mr Hood.

[Apart from affirming that Hood was a jolly good fellow, the report does not reveal what he did in the town, or where he is going.]
