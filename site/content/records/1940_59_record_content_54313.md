Burra Races had gate takings of £255 and bookmakers turned over £40,000 last Wednesday at a meeting that was an outstanding success.  The main race was the Burra Squatters’ Handicap, which was won by Minstrel Lass ridden by M. Raven and owned by W.G. Wylie.  The CWA luncheon was voted the best in the State.  The publican’s booth was operated by Ern Mutlow of the Burra Hotel.  The club’s profit is estimated at £350.  [Other results are not printed.]
