Burra and Districts Apex Club

With regret the current members of the Burra & Districts Apex Club have resolved to surrender their charter.  The main reason is the expectation placed upon each member to contribute $90 (i.e. in membership fees) as requested by the Zone Board.  Members consider this an excessive contribution and burden on community funds that have been raised within the community.  Among other things, over the years the club has contributed to the Community Newsletter, Morphett’s Enginehouse, Hallett RSL Hall, numerous fundraising barbecues, the playgroup equipment and work at the Burra Kindergarten.  The club has resolved to commit its surplus funds to the Community News, of which it has been a major sponsor since its inception.  We call on the members of the community to take over this role.
