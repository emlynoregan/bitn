Kooringa Methodist Sunday School Anniversary 6 & 7 May.  Rev. Gordon Rowe of Rose Park preached.  Heavy rain reduced attendance.  The singing of the children was the best for many years and reflected credit on Mr G.E. Dane.  Tea on 7th was well attended.  The main want of the school is for teachers in Primary and Secondary classes.
