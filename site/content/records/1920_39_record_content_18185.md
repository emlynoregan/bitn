Burra Town Council, 21 December (Concluded)

The Mayor said another coat of tar was needed at once on the Aberdeen Road.

Cr Woollacott, as Chairman of the Public Works, was offended that the Mayor had ordered work done without consulting him: work that was unsatisfactory and would involve extra cost.

The Mayor said immediate action had been needed and he consulted as many Councillors as he could at the time.

The Overseer agreed that immediate action had been needed.

The road is to be tarred again.
