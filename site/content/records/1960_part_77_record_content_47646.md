Burra Police station & Court House

In answer to a question in Parliament the Hon. J.W.H. Coumbe replied that the new premises in Burra will combine a residence, sergeantâ€™s office and separate cell block.  The general police office will be used for certain minor court actions, but the Burra North Court House will be retained for general court purposes.  Tenders to improve acoustics there are a separate matter and planning is continuing with tenders expected to be called at an early date.
