Burra Mine.  The Burra Mine has been sold.  Adelaide & Wallaroo Fertilizers Ltd will buy the assets and business of Poseidon Ltd’s Burra Copper Operation, Samin Ltd.  In 1973 Poseidon and Adelaide Wallaroo jointly formed Adelaide Copper to link the Burra mining resources with the fertiliser group’s manufacturing and marketing techniques.  Adelaide Wallaroo now wholly owns this copper sulphate operation, which almost trebled sales in 1976-77 and is understood to be at least breaking [even] at present.  The Burra sales will need approval by the SA Mines Minister of the transfer of the mining leases to Adelaide-Wallaroo.  The present depressed state of the copper price and markets has had an effect on the Mine, but a recent statement by the Minister for Trade and Resources Mr Anthony indicated a promising future.  He said Samin had said it expected to substantially increase sales to Australian markets [for copper oxide] in 1978.  Negotiations are being conducted for increased sales to the US at more favourable prices.
