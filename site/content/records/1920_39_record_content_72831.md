Obituary.  C.A.S. Hawker MHR died when he was a passenger in Australia’s worst aviation disaster, the crashing of Australia National Airways Douglas Airliner Kyeema.  He had resided for a number of years at ‘Dillowie’ Station on the Canowie side of Hallett.  On entering Federal Parliament his rise was meteoric and he was fast becoming a statesman.  He was born on Bungaree (near Clare) 44 years ago, the son of Mr & Mrs M. Hawker and was educated at Geelong Grammar where he shone as a sportsman and a scholar.  In the Great War he enlisted in a British Infantry Regiment and in 1915 lost an eye and had a leg fractured and his life was despaired of.  Despite this, on recovering he persuaded the authorities to return him to France where he was again wounded in the spine and unable to walk.  While in this state he completed his degree and returned to SA to manage the Hawker wheat and wool properties.  Then by surgery and tenacity he was eventually able to walk with sticks.  He became an ardent supporter of the RSL, the Repatriation Department, War Pensions etc. and for soldier settlers.  In 1932 he resigned from the Lyons Cabinet having given his word to electors he would vote for Parliamentary salaries to be reduced to £600.  He voted against the Government and resigned.  With the extra money he was forced to accept he financed certain young farming enthusiasts and maintained acclimatisation ploys at Sutherlands beyond Goyder’s Line [near Eudunda].  He was the ablest and best informed MP on rural affairs.  In 1936 he flew to Japan to get first hand information on the trade dispute.  In 1935 he investigated livestock and agricultural industries in Britain, Europe and Russia.  He was also well informed on foreign affairs and defence.  Many believe the Prime Minister acted foolishly in accepting his resignation in 1932 or at least in not subsequently restoring him to the front bench.  He was unmarried.
