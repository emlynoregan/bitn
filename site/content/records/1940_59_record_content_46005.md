The Board of Management has asked the Hospitals Department to arrange a visit by the Chief Secretary, a representative of the Architect-in-Chief’s Department and a representative from the Hospitals Department, to discuss the idea of building a new hospital, or methods of modernising the existing one.  Nothing was heard from the Government for a month and then polio hit the hospital hard, as well as two cases of pneumonia and one of TB of the chest.  The hospital requested a prefabricated building for isolation and after an initial lack of response, a call to the Central Board of Health has resulted in a promise to try to get one delivered by the weekend.  The called-for visit of the Chief Secretary and party is to occur today.

Some years ago the Hospital Board got plans for a nurses building and the only tender was for £16,000.  The Government thought this excessive at £800 per nurse, but eventually agreed, by which time prices had risen and the contractor then wanted £20,000, so nothing was done.  Nurses continued to live in poor conditions and were handed the isolation building, which had been unused for years.  Now with polio, an isolation area is in demand, but we cannot ask the nurses to move out of the isolation block without losing their services altogether.

It is time to get going on a new building.  Old buildings can only be kept clean with a massive effort and an army of workers.  Modern buildings require a minimum of effort.

We should build a new hospital and turn the old one over to the nurses to live in, to use the private rooms as accommodation and with the present wards as common rooms.  About £50,000 would be needed for a new hospital and we expect the Government would subsidise it £ for £.  We have £5,000, leaving £20,000 to be raised.  If each farmer gave 2d per bushel of wheat sold and each pastoralist 1d per lb of wool, it would easily be raised.  Townspeople have never been lacking in initiative for raising funds for a good cause.
