SA Wheat in England.  Mr Paxton offered a prize at Aylesbury in 1858 for the best SA wheat grown in England.  Mr Paxton has done wheat growers here a service by calling attention to the excellent qualities of colonial wheat.  Paxton has sent a letter to Henry Ayers outlining the results of the competition.  Of some 15 competitors, one of his brothers took the prize.  [Further details are printed.]
