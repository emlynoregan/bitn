Characteristics of the paper for 1958.

Generally a fairly patchy coverage of town and district news.  There was little follow-up on items – for example the Adelaide-Burra Road Race was described as going to happen, but it was not reported when it did.  Typographical errors and unreadable settings were not unusual.  Page 1 carried most of the news and on subsequent pages there was very little if you took out sports, reports from the CWA and Red Cross and a regular article: The Christian Message.

Page 1.

Pretty much solid news.

Pages 2 & 3.

A mixture of small and large advertisements, but large advertisements were common.  Stock firms often occupy much of page 2.  Some news appears on page 3 in some issues, but often it is all advertising and notices.

Pages 4 5 & 6.

Generally dominated by large advertisements with less than 1 column of news.

Page 7.

Often this carries little or no news and the ‘Cash Column’ occupies much of the space.  This, however, migrated to other pages at times depending on size.

Page 8.

Similar to pages 4-6.
