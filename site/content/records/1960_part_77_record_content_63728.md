The commencement of stage 2 is scheduled for September 1973.  The copper ore body at Burra was worked over by hand picking as a high grade deposit between 1845 and 1877, contributing valuable wealth to the state at a critical time.  It was later worked on a small scale by the Burr [Burra] Copper Co. 1901-07.  No further work of importance was undertaken till December 1961 when the SA Department of Mines began investigation.  By December 1961 they had discovered interesting reserves of oxidised copper ore.  Late in 1969 Samin Ltd acquired the leases and with State Government assistance in providing necessary infrastructure, it commenced to develop the property.
