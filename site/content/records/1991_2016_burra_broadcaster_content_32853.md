Burra Visitor Centre

Manager Andrew Glen says it attracts mostly people in their late 40s.

50% are from SA.

40% come from the rest of Australia.

10% are overseas visitors.

Autumn, winter and spring are busy, with summer a quiet period.

The Burra Passport has always been the most popular product.

The centre saw 8,000 visitors in 2002 and 10,000 in 2003.*

This was thought to represent 20% of visitors to the town.

[* Note that this does not accord with the report in the issue of 19 November 2003, page 2 that said the Burra Visitor Centre had been busy with more than 10,000 visitors between July and October with Passport sales to just under 5,000 of them. The December version seems more believable.]
