Immigration Agent’s Report

Charles P. Brewer, Immigration Agent.  Immigration Office, Port Adelaide, 14 April 1850.

Three emigrant ships have arrived this quarter with 722 emigrants, being about half the number sent in each quarter of the previous 18 months.  Supply has, however, met demand except for miners, mine labourers and female domestic servants.

The Secretary of the SA Mining Association [Henry Ayers] has written, stating that the supply of mining labour is very deficient and they could immediately employ 100-150 more miners.  I believe if 200 miners arrived immediately they would find ready employment without affecting wages.

Only one case of misconduct is reported from the Government ships; the third mate on the Agincourt was found one night to have concealed himself in the single women’s apartment, for which he forfeited his gratuity.

There was a great deal of sickness on the Trafalgar.  Hooping cough was brought on board by a child and there was also much diarrhoea.  Seven children died of hooping cough and eleven other persons from disease, mainly fever.

23 were ill or convalescent on arrival and two subsequently died.

15 other passenger ships have also arrived.  The vast majority of the passengers were satisfied with their treatment during the journey.  However, on the Douglas and the Bolivar large quantities of spirits were sold to passengers, causing much drunkenness and misconduct.

The captain of the Douglas was fined £5 and of the Bolivar £20 for breeching Clause 42 of the Passengers’ Act.  The captain of the Brothers was also fined £5 for a similar offence.  Some of the surgeons on passenger ships are quite unsuitable, being in some cases habitual drunkards and in others madmen.

The Passengers’ Act provides no redress in such cases.

There has been an immigration of 377 persons from Germany, but 588 persons have sailed for California this quarter and several vessels are now laid on for that country.

For the Quarter ended 31 March 1850:

Emigrant vessels arrived	3

Deaths on board or in quarantine	22

Births on board or in quarantine	14

Gross number of migrants arrived	722

Ships arriving: Agincourt, Sea Queen, Trafalgar

[Sic, though 3067-1696=1371]
