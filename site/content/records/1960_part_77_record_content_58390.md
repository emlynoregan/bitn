Burra Show was held last Saturday in cold, windy conditions and achieved a total of 3,325 entries and a gate of $655.  It was opened by His Excellency the Japanese Ambassador Shizuo Saito, whose speech is printed.

The shearing competition was popular and the open class went to S .Pittaway and the novice class to Keith Weich.

Creditable displays were arranged by the Schools, Rural Youth and Samin Ltd.

Industrial stands attracted quite an interest.

The motor cycle trials were popular and the winner was R. Wakefield.

The usual dance in the evening was arranged by the Rural Youth in the RSL Hall where $227 was taken at the door.

Art entries were impressive.

The standard of goat entries was exceptionally high.

Pigeons had a very good section.

The judge was disappointed with most of the large fowls and though the bantams were good birds their presentation suffered because it was somewhat ragged after a long show season.

Grain and fodder entries were good and wheaten and oaten chaff exhibits were excellent.

Best in show for dogs was Mr Cuthbertâ€™s Bull Terrier.

There were 75 entries in the wool fleece section, which was very pleasing.

Though sheep numbers were not high, the quality was very good.

Cookery produced many very good entries, especially in fruit cakes and it was pleasing to see many juveniles entering.

Vegetables were reasonable to good this year, with increased numbers.

Needlework was pleasing.

The judge said the display of flowers was excellent.

Horses in action numbers were slightly down.
