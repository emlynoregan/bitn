Burra Town Council, 19 September

Cr Lott gave notice that he would move that in future Councillors be permitted to smoke at meetings.

Burra Institute Committee wrote asking Council to earmark the equivalent of 1d on the rates to enable reduction in Institute debt.  To be left with the Finance Committee.

A list showed six families on rations and entitled to participate in the Unemployed Relief Scheme.

The Mayor thought the worst aspect was that those struggling to survive without rations were denied access to the scheme.  Council agreed to participate in the scheme up to 25%.

The Mayor reported that the Burra-Adelaide Road Race would start from Burra on 1 October.

Cr Lott said the truck had used 103 gallons of petrol since 1 July.  This represented 8 miles per gallon.  Too much running must be in low gear.

Cr McWaters pointed out that much of the distance was in scavenging work.

The Overseer said that amounted to 30 miles per fortnight.
