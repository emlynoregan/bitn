Burra Methodist Mission.  Good attendances marked the meetings of the last week, for which the Missioner was Rev. R.D. Vawser of Eudunda Circuit.  Public meetings at Hanson, Farrell Flat, Ironmine and Kooringa drew appreciative if not large audiences.  The themes were To Whom Shall We Go? and The Reasonableness of Christianity.

[At Hanson Mrs M. Satchell sang O Lord Most Holy.]

There was a youth gathering at Redruth Memorial Hall on Tuesday 25 August, when 57 young people attended.  On Wednesday about 100 ladies attended a Ladies’ Afternoon in Kooringa Methodist Hall.  At the High School on Wednesday morning there was a session for students.  There was a Men’s Tea to which 56 men sat down and the Mission concluded with a good Sunday attendance at both Redruth and Kooringa.  [Mrs M. Satchell sang He shall feed his flock at Redruth in the morning.]
