New Electoral Boundaries

Mr Claude Allen MP has decided not to contest the seat of Frome at the next election.  Following the redistribution based on the one vote one value principle the electorate will become much larger and he says it could not be represented by one person and have the sort of representation the electors are entitled to.  The redistribution has been passed with Liberal Movement support.  Mr Allen was elected first as successor to the late P.H. Quirke in 1968.  In 1970 the Electorate of Burra was abolished.  The western half went to the electorate of Rocky River and the eastern half went into Frome.  Mr Allen won Frome and has contested and won four elections in just over seven years.  The present Electorate of Frome covers 38% of the state and could become larger with the redistribution.  Mr Allen will retire to Spalding on the completion of his parliamentary term.  Before becoming a politician he was a farmer for forty years.
