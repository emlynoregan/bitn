Mongolata Goldfield

Byles’ Mongolata GM Co. for the fortnight to 22 August.

The air compressor has failed and parts must come from Melbourne, which has delayed work on the main shaft.  Some minor cleaning up in the shaft has been possible.  Some exploration and sampling was done at the 50 ft level south, with mixed results.  A parcel of 151 tons from the 25 ft and 50 ft levels returned 45 oz 18 dwt.
