A Bolt.  Lance Tiver was driving Edgar Pearce’s dray at Aberdeen on Friday when Wirth’s elephants caused the horse to bolt.  In negotiating the Royal Exchange Corner the dray crashed and Mr Tiver was thrown right through the bar door.  The dray’s shafts were smashed off and the horse with harness attached galloped through the town to Mr Pearce’s stables.  The harness was badly damaged and the horse cut and bruised.  Mr Tiver surprisingly escaped with a shaking and a few abrasions.
