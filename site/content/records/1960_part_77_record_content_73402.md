Obituary.  Philip Bampton aged 73 was buried at Holy Cross Church, Goodwood, on 4 November.  Mr Bampton and his wife and family – Basil, Isabelle (Mrs Jim Hasse), Anne and Derek – came to Burra from India in the early 1950s.  They worked for St Joseph’s Church and Anne and Derek attended the Convent School.  His brother, Dr Bampton and his wife and family followed them, but Dr Bampton died soon after arriving.  The first of Mrs Bampton’s relatives to come to Burra in the late 1940s were the gentle Mr & Mrs Jim Elder (hairdressers at Burra and Burra North) and their parents, Mr & Mrs McKenna Senior and Eric, who were in business here before moving to their successful antique business on Unley Road.  (Jim Elder Jnr is also an antique dealer in North Adelaide.)  All these people will be remembered for their refinement and love of life. The change of life style from India to Burra could not have been an easy one, but Philip Bampton was sad when he left Burra to live in Elizabeth North.  He cycled around Burra & Burra North daily for many years as the postal delivery man.
