It is not true Dr Steele was annoyed with the Board.  Before he left he appointed me his attorney, so there can’t have been much wrong with my relations with him.  Dr Steele was in sympathy with the Board (for which I can produce documents) and instructed his locum tenens to attend Board meetings.

Mr Hawkes asserts that the Board became obsessed with a grudge against Dr Ashton, who is the only man capable of conducting operations in Burra.  I say that Dr Williams holds the same qualifications as Dr Ashton.  There is no grudge against Dr Ashton.

Mr Hawkes also says that in his last fortnight on the Board a vacancy occurred and young Mr McBride was appointed.  This is not true.  Mr McBride was appointed in July and Mr Hawkes resigned in the following January.  He goes on to comment on Mr McBride’s youth and lack of mature judgement.
