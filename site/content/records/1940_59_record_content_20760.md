The Board of Management has been officially notified of a further sum of £1,000 from the estate of the late C.E. Gebhardt.  This is to be used for Nurses’ Quarters and Private Wards.

Work proceeds on the new drainage pit.  Nurse J.L. Burne left at the end of last month to continue training at the RAH.
