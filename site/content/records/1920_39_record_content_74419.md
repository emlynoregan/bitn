Morgan-Whyalla Pipeline.  Following the establishment of BHP’s blast furnace it is estimated that 500,000,000 gallons will be needed annually and the provision of this by the SA Government was a condition of the blast furnace’s erection.  Evidence to the recent Commission proposes in addition to provide 900,000,000 gallons for places en route with the total 1,400,000,000 gallons to be provided by pumping two shifts per day.  The cost is estimated at £2,409,000 of which mains account for £1,725,960.  Pumping costs for Whyalla’s needs are £134,000, but twice this volume would cost £146,000.  The full 900,000 allocated for use elsewhere would not be needed for many years.  Tests show river salinity compares favourably with metropolitan sources.
