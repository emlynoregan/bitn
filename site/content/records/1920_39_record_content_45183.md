Harry Byles had discovered the gold at Mongolata.  He had known Harry Byles for 40 years and employed him for 20.  He was an honest and straight person.  Originally the mine started as a syndicate for about 6 months and he [Warnes] had taken the first share.  A company was then formed.  He felt sure they could find water and their first idea was to erect a battery themselves (two votes for and three against), but he was sure the public battery was a better solution.  He congratulated Dr Ward on the fine battery.  The company had been responsible for the bore.  For a time the men were on day work and after a time they wanted shorter hours and more money.  There were 11 men and they went out on strike.  They had been getting 10/6 to 12/6 a day and the company’s bill was £110 a fortnight.  Men could not expect too much in the start-up phase of mining.  At present the union had a log for 17/- a day which would drive away private capital.  The owners were attempting to formulate a reasonable arrangement until the mine was proved.  With respect to the report of poor quality of water in the tank, the Council would not act on hearsay, had they sent a sample to the Council’s Health Officer it would have been tested.

Up to now 1,500oz of gold had been produced worth £9,000 (at £6 an oz).  The field had been discovered in October 1930 and there were c. 500 tons of ore at grass.  Several mines were showing real promise.

He congratulated Mr Grundy the manager of the battery on the job he had done.  He also thanked the Morgan family for their generous help in the development of the field.

Mr Woollacott mayor of Burra then spoke.

He congratulated Mr Richards on becoming Premier.  He thought that the future would justify all that had been done for the field.  In February 1931 there were about 50 men on rations in Burra and they had asked him for some support.  On 13 May the Burra Record had published an encouraging report of the field saying they believed in 12 months there would be a small town and battery there and this came to be almost literally correct.  The Mines Department furnished aid in the form of tools, wire rope and other aid after a report on 28 August 1931.  Dr Ward and Mr Gepp then reported on the field that Government assistance was justified and 500 gallons of drinking water was sent out every week from Burra.  In February 1932 the Engineer-in-Chief and the Commissioner of Public Works visited and were asked to put down a water catchment for rain water and that had since been completed.  After a visit by the Premier Hon. Lionel Hill on 16 June 1932 a battery had been granted and there was little doubt the field would now prosper.  In closing he thanked C.A.S. Hawker and Senators Daly and O’Halloran for their help in getting military boots, clothes and blankets provided for the men.

Cr J. Kellock represented Burra DC.  He urged all to go through Byles’ Mine while it was open, as the field suffered from a lack of publicity.  People in WA knew more about Mongolata than did those in Adelaide.  The road to Mongolata through the DC of Burra needed making, but they had received only £130 for 2½ miles and not much could be done with that.

The Premier was called upon to open the battery.

He was not going to make promises concerning funding.  The Department would give due consideration to requests and answers would depend on merit.  While sympathising with Mr Warnes dilemma over miners’ pay he should consider the risks miners ran.  Scientists had found that ground up quartz lodged in the lungs and as a result the average length of a miners’ life was 45 years.  He did not claim to be an expert, but thought he was giving practical help when he arranged for men on rations on the fields to receive an extra meat ration.  The function of a Government battery is to treat bulk parcels of ore at reasonable cost which may lead to mines getting their own batteries later and it supplies a facility for mines not big enough to install their own.  It is to encourage development in small fields and mines yet to prove themselves that the Government maintains batteries at Mt Torrens, Peterborough, Tarcoola and now Mongolata.  Like the Tarcoola battery this one is right on the field itself to spare cartage costs.  While there are other applicants for processing any one source will be limited to 50 tons.

[He then elaborated on more technical details of how the battery would operate, why variations in value per ounce must be expected and other variations in output and also how the bullion could be disposed of.]
