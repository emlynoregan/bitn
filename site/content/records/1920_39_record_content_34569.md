Farewell to Mr & Mrs W.G. Hawkes

Stockowners gathered at the Eastern Telephone Building on Friday afternoon under President I.J. Warnes to farewell Mr & Mrs W.G. Hawkes.  Mr Warnes regretted the departure and said he understood Mrs Hawkes’ health was a main reason for their retirement to Adelaide.  The credit for Koonoona Stud being known from Darwin to Brisbane and from Perth to Mt Gambier was Mr Hawkes.  He had been a good master over many employees and a good townsman for many years.  He had been chairman of the Burra Hospital Board for many years.  He had faced bad times as well as good ones.  He had worked with Mr Warnes on the Pastoral Committee of the Royal Show.  He was an excellent speaker.  He presented Mr Hawkes with a magnificent Onkaparinga rug with an inscribed leather tag.

The Mayor Mr A.B. Riggs also spoke as Mayor of Burra as well as a pastoralist.  He endorsed Mr Warnes’ remarks and said the RSL would also lose a staunch supporter.

Mr A.G. Gebhardt recalled earlier days of polo playing and Mr Hawkes’ ponies Barbett & Pierrot and wished the couple well in their future life.

Chesters Sandland of Koo-owie spoke for the Apoinga DC saying Mr Hawkes had been chairman there for 30 or 40 years except for one year which he spent in England when the speaker’s father took over.  He had been a prudent and economical director of the Council’s affairs.  He had virtually created Black Springs, having been behind the establishment of everything there.

Walter Murray of Cappeedee spoke in support of Mr Hawkes’ generosity with breeding advice.
