Obituary.  A memorial service was held for William Stephen Pengelly Thomas on 18 May.  He was born in Aberdeen 51 years ago.  His father was a pioneer of the district.  Will attended Stanton’s Grammar School and was one of five brothers, three of whom survive him, as does his father at 82.  As a boy he worked with his father at Banbury and was converted in the old church under Rev. C. Tresise.  [Is this a reference to the original Mt Bryan East Church or the old Mt Bryan Church?]  Soon afterwards he went to the far north and into Queensland, before finally getting work at the Broken Hill Smelters, where he contracted lead poisoning.  He married Miss Howe at the Bible Christian Manse there.  He also worked for the same smelting company at Port Adelaide and Port Pirie – in total for 18½ years.  More recently he returned to the family at Mt Bryan East, but in a very poor state of physical and mental health.  In his final months he found solace in God.  He leaves a wife, two sons and a daughter.  [Born William Steven Thomas 17 March 1866 Redruth: died William Stephen Pengelly Thomas 23 March 1919 Mt Bryan East.]
