Burra-The Barrier Railway.  The report by J. Randall Mann runs to c. 1Â¼ columns.  He suggests that a slightly different line from that proposed by local advocates would be best.  Details of the route are given, but the ultimate recommendation is that it is a less favourable route than that from Petersburg.
