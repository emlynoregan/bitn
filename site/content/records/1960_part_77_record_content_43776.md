Amalgamation of Councils

No objections have been received to the proposed union of the Burra Burra District Council and the Town Council and the period for objections has now passed.

The area of the proposed union will be divided into nine wards: Burra Town, Kooringa, Baldina, Booborowie, Leighton, Mt Bryan, Mongolata, Farrell Flat and Hanson.  Each ward except Burra Town is to have one Councillor, with Burra Town to have three.  Provision is to be made for the election of a Mayor as in the Corporation.  Assessments will be on the basis of unimproved land values.  There has been no call for a poll of ratepayers and so the petition has been drawn up and will be signed and sealed at a special combined meeting of the two Councils tonight.  It is hoped that the proclamation of the union will enable the combined Councils to sit as one commencing in April.  This would give time for the preparation of and the calling of nominations for Councillors for all wards to form the new Council to operate from 1 July 1969.  The February and March meetings of both Councils will remain divided.  A Bill to amend the Local Government Act 1934-67 to cover the election of a Mayor under circumstances similar to those which exist here will go before the Legislative Council when it sits next.  It is anticipated that a Mayor for the whole area will be elected by ratepayers and in turn be appointed Chairman of the Council.  Previously it had been understood the Mayor would be elected by ratepayers and a Chairman elected by Council.  With Mr T.G. Perry acting as Town Clerk all business of the Town Council is being conducted from the District Council Office in Commercial Street.
