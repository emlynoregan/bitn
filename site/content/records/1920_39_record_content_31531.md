Mr Tenant confirmed that the car was not resting on the deceased.  He believed the car had skidded on loose gravel.  He knew Wells and had confidence in him as a driver.  Sgt McDonald said Wells was sober and answered all questions rationally.  The coroner accepted the evidence that the road was poor and that there was no evidence of excessive speed.  The verdict was death by misadventure.
