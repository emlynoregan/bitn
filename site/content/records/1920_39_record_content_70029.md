Burra Burra Show Inc. held its AGM in the Eastern Telephone Building 7 March with I.J. Warnes in the chair.  The officers were re-elected unopposed.

The Sheep Dogs Trials were held on 9 & 10 April 1937 and the SA Sheep Dog Assoc. Championship was competed for and won by A.B. Kemp of Victoria.

Wild onions are the main problem on the ground and have been attacked by working bees.

Sheep have been used to attack three-corner Jacks.  61 new members have been enrolled.

The Annual Show was held on 30 October and was well attended in good weather.  Centenary Hall was built in 1936.  If half the amount was collected I.J. Warnes offered to pay the other half and this has now been done.

Profit on the year was £70-8-9 and with the balance of money collected to finish paying off the hall the overdraft has been reduced by £125-4-9.

The trip to Sturt Vale was very successful in 1937 and the trip this year is arranged for 4 April.

The President said he would like to see the prize money raised by £25.

The Secretary M.S. Edwards said the overdraft had been reduced to £276-6-10 with assets valued at over £4,000.

M.A. Radford opposed the adoption of the report, complaining that the President had ordered the withdrawal of his (Radford’s) wool from the class for owners in pastoral leases, saying the wool had to be shorn from sheep grazed on pastoral leases and had been bred and lived there all their lives.  He felt this was a personal insult and the rules did not so stipulate and what right had one member of the society to so rule when the conditions say nothing about the sheep having to be bred on the pastoral leases.  He had been a keen supporter of the Show Society for 25 years, but would now wash his hands of it.  The clause he referred to read: ‘All wool to be shorn from sheep, bred, owned and depastured by the exhibitor in the class they are entered for.’ And was headed ‘A Class for Owners in Pastoral Leases.’

[Continued page 4.]

Mr Warnes asked if Mr Radford’s wool was stopped two years ago and Mr Radford seemed unclear.  Mr Warnes said the secretary would reply, but plenty of exhibitors had been stopped the year before last in certain sections and had Mr Radford made enquiries he would have got satisfaction.  Mr Edwards said the society had endeavoured to have exhibits bred, grown and reared by the exhibitor on the country it was from to show the different types of wool and sheep and not to have bought exhibits placed in these classes.  In sheep exhibits one exhibitor used to buy fat sheep in Adelaide and take them around the country shows collecting all the prizes.  They did not want a similar thing to happen with wool.  He stood by the rules of the society.  The rules had been altered and advertised in The Record and in the catalogue and if Mr Radford had not read the same it was not the fault of the society.

Mr Radford said if the officials had said they regretted the occurrence and were sorry about it he would have said no more.  He asked for the minutes of the meeting that made the decision.  Mr Warnes said none were kept for such hurriedly called meetings on the ground.

Mr Radford said he would have nothing more to do with the society and left.

The President said he was one of three members of the Technical Committee at the Royal Show and gave instances of similar decisions having to be made there.

I.J. Warnes was re-elected President with A.B. Riggs & S.H. Robinson as Vice-Presidents.  The next show is set for Saturday 29 October.
