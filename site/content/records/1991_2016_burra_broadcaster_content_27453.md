The Pascoe Collection of stud merino sheep photographs has been displayed in the Burra Town Hall.  It is on permanent loan from the SA Stud Merino Sheepbreeders’ Association.  Max Rayner will officially open the display on Monday 18 March.  The merino stud display was developed by Richard Pascoe, a Burra hairdresser, who began collecting photographs and other related items in 1910, which he then displayed on the walls of his shop.  This proved to be a good marketing ploy.  The first contributor was L.W. Gebhardt and others soon followed his example.  Among notable visitors to the collection was Prime Minister Bruce in 1925.  One of the party, Senator R.V. Wilson, presented a set of photographs of stud rams of SA, NSW and Tasmania.  They had previously been part of a display at the Wembley Exhibition in London.  In recent times the collection was scattered around the town.  The National Trust has had the bulk of the collection for some time.  Some items needed restoration and the SA Stud Merino Sheepbreeders’ Association has generously offered to arrange for this.  Apart from the official opening of the Merino Heritage Display on 18 March there will be other items on display and Elders will host a barbecue at the Town Hall.
