Fire & Inquest.  On Saturday evening about 8.30 fire was reported at the premises known as Sara & Dunstan’s and now occupied by Otto Bartholomaeus, carpenter and builder.  The origin is a mystery not clarified at the inquest which was held on Tuesday at the Bon Accord Hotel.  About 400 people soon gathered and there were plenty of hands to assist in fire fighting, but the building of wood and iron containing timber produced flames of such height that the rays were seen at Farrell’s Flat and Mt Bryan.  Swagmen raised the alarm.  The quantity of timber kept the fire going for several hours.  The verdict was that it was started by person or persons unknown with no indication of whether it was accidental or otherwise.  Building and contents insurance was £350 and £150 respectively and the estimated loss £800-£900.
