Wesley Bicentenary Church Hanson, Wednesday 14 October.

Bad weather kept some away, but there was still a good crowd at 3 p.m. when Rev. H.J. Pope, President of Conference preached a sermon in the State Schoolroom.  The memorial stone service was preached by Rev. W.F. James.  Mr Jesse Humphrys laid the first stone.  The President then laid the Wesley bicentenary stone.  For over two hours the tea tables in the council chamber were crowded.

Historic sketch by Rev. W.F. James.

Services at Hanson began nearly 25 years ago in the house of the late Mr Rogers and were continued in the Council Chamber.  In 1880 Hanson, Farrell’s Flat, Stony Gap and Black Springs comprised a Home Mission.  After 9 years of struggle even a liberal Home Mission grant couldn’t support the Mission and in March 1888 Farrell’s Flat was joined to the Mintaro Circuit and Hanson and Stony Gap to the Burra Circuit.  When that divided they became part of the Redruth Circuit.  An organ was purchased two years ago.  Some 15 years ago Mr J. Lane gave £20 to the Wesley Jubilee Fund towards new churches at World’s End and Hanson.  The former got built, but the latter was not realised even with a three year extension and the £10 went to other uses.  Three years ago fund raising started for the present effort.  It was begun with £20 from Jesse Humphrys.  Two acres of land at the corner of South and West Terraces were obtained and since then £150 has been raised towards the building.

Over £40 was laid on the stones at the ceremonies including a donation from the Federal Speaker, Sir Frederick Holder.  The tea and collections raised £10.  This means there is £200 raised of the estimated £250 needed to open the church free of debt.

[Considerable more detail of the people involved in the history of this church is given in the article.]
