Kooringa, 18 January.

Large quantities of grain are being delivered at Aberdeen and there is great competition between wheat buyers.

John Hutson is building a wheelwright’s shop and other improvements are being made in Commercial Street.

A presentation of a handsome gold locket and ring was made to D. Wells by the Foresters’ Lodge on Friday evening.  The articles were made by A. Day of Adelaide.
