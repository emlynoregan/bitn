Burra Institute held its AGM on 23 January.

On 1 January 1938 they held 5,124 books.  In the year 473 new books were added and 500 old books withdrawn.

12 scholars were given free subscriptions.  Membership increased slightly.

On 31 December 1937 there were 56 double and 145 single subscriptions for a total of 201.

On 31 December 1938 there were 63 double and 152 single subscriptions for a total of 215.

In the year the Institute proposed to the Town Council that they take over the Institute.  Ratepayers voted against the proposal, but one consequence was a receipt from the Council of £60.  The Institute committee wishes to use a portion of that for much needed repairs to the front of the Institute.

The Government grant was up some £20 to £70-5-1 and was expended on the purchase of books.  Elected for 1939 were: President, M.W. Bednall, Vice-President, F.L. Worth; Treasurer, A.B. Riggs & Secretary, W.E. Richards.
