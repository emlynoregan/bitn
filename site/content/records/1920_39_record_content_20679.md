The Methodist Church was re-opened on 4 September.  Mrs Josiah Thomas re-opened the door.  She is a member of one of the pioneering families and as a little girl (Mary Pinch) lived at Copperhouse.  Rev. H. Alvey conducted the open-air service.  The little town, he said, had once boasted two churches and two hotels and who knew but that the mineral wealth of the hills might bring people there again.  Doris Coon presented a bouquet to Mrs Thomas.  John Drew in responding for Mrs Thomas referred to the old families of the town: Seaman, Forsyth, Nickles, Saunders [Sanders], Dunneman, Menz, Lomman and many others.
