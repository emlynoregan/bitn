Burra Burra DC has adopted a new assessment.  The valuation of 1971 is $5,923,370; a drop from $7,328,700.  The previous rate of 0.9c in the dollar will have to rise to 1.1c in the dollar to maintain the income of $65, 958.  The new rate will be discussed at Mondayâ€™s Council meeting.

Due to a strike of refinery maintenance workers the Local Government Department stopped Council plants from operating.
