St Edmund’s Booborowie

On Wednesday 5 December Mrs A. Affolter laid the foundation stone.  Rev. F.B. Hewitson officiated and Rev. A. Webb gave an address.  £127 was laid on the stone.

The walls, to be of stone, are up.  The interior measures 36 ft x 22 ft and will seat 80.  A porch will be built and the total cost is estimated at £1,150.  Provision is made to add a chancel and vestry.  The collection of money began in 1914, but was delayed for five years by the war.  A.S. Browne, one of the original owners of Booborowie, generously donated £150 and at present only about £150 is required.  A concert and dance followed in the evening.  Total proceeds for the day were over £160.
