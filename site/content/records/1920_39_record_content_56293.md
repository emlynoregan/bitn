Redruth Methodist Church celebrated its Anniversary 2 & 3 June when Rev. E.H. Harrison of Eudunda gave three fine addresses.  The choir under W.H. Gare gave excellent service, as did soloists Mr Lindsay Thomas and Mavis Gare and the duet by the Misses Mavis Fairchild and Jean McWaters was excellently rendered.  Miss Clarice Reed and Miss Margaret Pearce were the organists.

During the year the Sunday school has been repainted.
