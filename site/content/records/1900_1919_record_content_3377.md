Boer War.  James Reed of Redruth has received a letter from Mr Ben Archibald who joined the 10th Reserves at Cape Town for active service in South Africa.  He tells of 6½ months of active service tracking down De Wet and De Leray and other Boer Generals.  He tells of the capture of over 100 prisoners at Bothevale, but also of an engagement after which 700 men did not answer the roll call.  In all there is about ⅔ column of detail, but no indication of who Ben Archibald was.

[SA Births, Marriages & Deaths offer no suggestions either.]
