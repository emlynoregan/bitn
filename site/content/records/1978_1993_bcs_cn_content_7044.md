Burra Burra DC.  The Governor has issued a proclamation merging the Baldina and Mongolata Wards within the District of Burra to form one ward, to be named the Eastern Ward, which will be represented by one Councillor only.  Currently Tony Barker represents Baldina and Jack Oates represents Mongolata.  At the same time a proclamation increases Burra Town Wardâ€™s representation from three to four Councillors.  Both changes will take effect from the next Council election.
