The Smelting Works.  An Italian who has been working at Building A.B. Riggsâ€™s house recently sent a small quantity of slag from the Burra slag heap to the city to have its suitability tested for tile making.  A further 50 tons have been sent for.  If things turn out as anticipated it would be a profitable speculation for the present owners, considering the size of the heap.
