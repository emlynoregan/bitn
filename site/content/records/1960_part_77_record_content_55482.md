Redruth Ladies Guild

Mrs Reta Jennison reported on the activities for 1970 in c. â…” column.  The Gala Day in November was on a smaller scale than in previous years, being an afternoon function only and lacking the customary tea and evening concert.  Mr & Mrs Scroop attended to the planning and erecting of stalls.

Obituary.  In passing there is a reference to the death of Miss Bentley and this seems to be the only reference to it in the paper.

[Maria Grace Bentley born 7 December 1880 Redruth: died 9 November 1970 Burra North.]
