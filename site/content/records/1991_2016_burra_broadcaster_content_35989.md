Burra’s Jailhouse Rock event attracted record crowds for its seventh year.  The Friday night dance in the Burra Town Hall attracted 90 people.  Saturday morning saw Paul O’Bryan’s Band provide the music for enthusiastic Rock ’n’ Roll dance demonstrations in Market Square.  On Saturday night a record crowd of 270 enjoyed a balmy evening at Redruth Gaol with music by Paul O’Bryan’s Band and Adelaide band Jump ’n’ Jive.  About 180 attended Sunday’s brunch by the Burra Creek.  [Photos.]
