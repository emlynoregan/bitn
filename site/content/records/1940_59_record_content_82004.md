Sheep Killed

Dogs have again been killing sheep in the district.  Mr J.G. Carpenter has lost numerous sheep and so has the adjoining landowner, Mr G. Morgan.  Their paddocks are on the outskirts of the town.

A new By-Law is awaiting the Governorâ€™s seal.  It prevents dogs in a public place except on a lead and they are not to be tethered within 8 ft of a shop.  [Working dogs under control are exempt.]
