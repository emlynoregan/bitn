Burra Hospital Board, 23 July

W.G. Hawkes was elected Chairman for another year.  The new Isolation Ward was in use and erection and furnishing had cost c. Â£1,800.  Appropriately the family of the late James Gallagher were the first to use it (after he had donated so much towards it).

The interior of the hospital has now all been painted.
