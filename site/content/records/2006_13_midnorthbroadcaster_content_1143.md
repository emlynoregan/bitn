Burra Town Hall

Built in 18751, the Burra Town Hall has had an exciting history.  Volunteers are now helping to return it to its turn of the century grandeur.  Retired painter, Roy Taplin has volunteered his time to do the renovations, which started about six weeks ago.  Changes have included repositioning the back wall of the hall to give more room in the foyer, a new floor [surface] for the entrance and repainting the walls and ceiling of the foyer and the walls of the main hall and its ceiling rose[s].  The old design on the presidiums [sic: for proscenium] will be reproduced and the floor of the main hall will be painted.  The refurbished hall will have an official re-opening in October.  Volunteers show visitors around the hall with about 1,530 visitors since June 20062.

In the future it is hoped to make the old projector rom available for visitors.  The Town Hall Committee and Burra History Group has made a large collection of photographs available for viewing and for sale in the supper room.
