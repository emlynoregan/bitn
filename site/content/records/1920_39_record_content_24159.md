Cr Riggs moved a change to the way money from rates is allotted to Wards: 5/14 to East and North Wards and 4/14 to West Ward.  At present after deducting common expenses 75% of the rest of the rates is divided in proportion to the rates collected in each ward.  The main problem was that in North Ward there are several roads that are practically main roads, but are not so designated and have to be maintained by the ward.  The proposal would move about £41 from East Ward and £19 from West Ward.

The Mayor was sympathetic, but thought it needed further consideration.

Cr Bednall wanted ratepayer input.

Cr Kellaway was opposed – it should go to ratepayers.  The cemetery road in East Ward was like the North Ward roads: used by the public generally.

Cr Harris said North Ward had had an opportunity to take in the new houses at Graham, but only a few voted to do so.  Kooringa feeling was against the move.

Cr Allen was also opposed.

Cr Riggs said if North Ward had taken in Graham it would only have meant more roads to keep in order.  The motion was lost.
