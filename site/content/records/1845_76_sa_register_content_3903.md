The South Australian ‘Redruth’

The sale of Redruth on 29 August was quite extraordinary, as already reported.  Of the 120 allotments, 7 were reserved by the Government and sum of £5067 odd was obtained from the other lots offered, generally each of less than half an acre and totalling less than 28 acres of ‘wild’ land.  The upset [or minimum] price set by the Government would have realised only £574-5-0, but two of the allotments nearly trebled that total; having been knocked down for £400 and £350 respectively.

The 1,040 town acres originally laid out as Adelaide and at the Port realised only £3,991-16-0 (reckoning 12/- per acre from the preliminary holders of 437 and the full average for the reserved acres), and yet that sale was considered a mighty achievement.
