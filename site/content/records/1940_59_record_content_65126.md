Burra Burra Hospital held its AGM 22 September with W. Carpenter in the chair, as the Chairman F.T. Marston had left the district and Vice-Chairman M. de N. Lucas was absent.

The year had been a busy one for the Board due to the extra duties imposed by the new building.

On 2 October 1953 the Hon. the Premier T. Playford laid the foundation stone.  Work then continued and is now finished, leaving the furnishing, which was undertaken by Mesdames Ashton & Tennant.  Thanks are extended for the excellent work of the appeals committee.  Arrangements are in hand for the opening on Friday 1 October by G. Stanley Hawker MP.

The financial position has improved and the revenue and expenditure account shows a profit of £525.  This has mainly been due to a depleted nursing staff and therefore a lesser amount being paid in wages.  One disturbing aspect of finance is the amount of unpaid patient fees.  At the beginning of the year this was £2,419 and had increased to £3,748 by 30 June 1954.  It is hoped to arrest this drift.

Care has been given to maintaining the old buildings.  The roof has been painted and no major maintenance work is now expected for a long time.

The Board regrets the loss through removal from the district of the Chairman, Mr F.T. Marston, who had been a valuable member of the Board.

Dr G.L. Mellor, who had been the Medical Officer, left the town and the position has been filled by Dr R.B. Pitcher.  Mr E.R. Davey has taken over as secretary from R.H. Campbell.  The failure of subscribers and ratepayers to nominate three persons to the Board suggests people in the district are not hospital minded.  The positions were filled only through the efforts of Board members and especially of Mrs Tennant.

[Dr Pitcher’s report dealt with statistics and outlined ongoing problems in getting and keeping trained staff.]

A vote of thanks went to retiring members Mrs Ashton and Messrs Marston and Lucas.

Mrs Tennant explained a drawing from Kemps’ Nurseries Ltd for beautifying the area in front of the buildings.

Deidre Snell of Booborowie has done well in Elocution Exams at the Academy of Arts after three years of study. She will sit for her degree in December this year.  In December 1953 she topped the state.  She is currently studying Leaving at Burra High School.

Deidre travels to Adelaide once a fortnight, every other Saturday, for a lesson with he elocution teacher Mrs E. Langsford, to whom she says she attributes much of her success.]
