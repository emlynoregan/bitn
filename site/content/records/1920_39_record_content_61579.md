Burra Burra DC, 1 June

Council resolved to support the tarring of the Leasingham-Mintaro-Burra route.

Lots 15 & 16 Lostwithiel were transferred from the War service Homes Commissioner to Ernest Albert Threadgold.  Also lot 17.  [But this time it says Copperhouse, which is probably a mistake.]

Centenary Celebrations Committee decided to buy arches and electrical lights etc. from Eudunda.

The Floral Float for September is progressing well.  The ladies are busy making thousands of flowers for its decoration.  Burra Old Colonists Assoc. in Adelaide is also entering a float.

A great Schools Demonstration is planned for 5 October.

Tree planting is continuing apace under Mr R.J. Fairchild.

SAR is being asked to run a cheap special to Adelaide on 18 September to allow all residents to see Adelaide at its best.
