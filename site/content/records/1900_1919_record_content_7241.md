Burra High School.  [Bleak House] Principal’s Report for 1902.

Epidemics of measles and pneumonia made attendance sadly irregular for two quarters.  Dorothy Roach is Dux for 1902.

In Class IV Mollie Stafford is ahead of all others as she was the only pupil present for all four quarterly exams.  In the junior class Joy Sangster has the highest exam average.  Rev. W. Murphy has done excellent volunteer work.  There were so many absences at the end of 1902 that it was decided to postpone prize giving till Easter 1903.  The prize list is printed.
