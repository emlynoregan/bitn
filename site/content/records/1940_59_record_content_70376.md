Burra Swimming Pool

The Burra Progress Assoc. decided at their AGM to leave any decision on a pool to a public meeting and the Mayor will be asked to call such a meeting.

A survey has shown that only about 10% of school children in the district can swim.  The cost of a pool is expected to be about Â£3,000. Sites and water are not problems.
