Obituary and Inquest.  An inquest was held at the Burra Hotel last Wednesday on the body of Mrs Dare, wife of William Dare. [Of Piltimitiappa]  [Formerly Mary Ann Canton, nee Sluber.]

William Dare gave evidence of her last days.  His and others’ evidence extends over 1⅓ columns but the key to the verdict lies in statements like:

‘There was a cask each of wine and brandy and a five gallon keg of rum brought into the house on the return of the party from the Burra, the greater part of this was drunk by Mr & Mrs Dare.’

Dr Sangster had no hesitation in ascribing the death to alcoholic poisoning.

Dr Brummitt agreed.

So did the jury, adding ‘their sense of the impropriety of Mr Dare’s conduct in aiding and abetting such decided intemperance.’  [I cannot find any registration of death.]
