Andrew Glen writes questioning the manner of reporting in the article ‘Burra Online’ in which it seemed to be implied that this was a new thing.  He says Burra has been available online for some time:

Dick Cleland developed a private site some years ago: www.weblogic.com

Regional Council of Goyder has www.goyder.sa.gov.au

Burra Visitor centre four years ago had www.visitburra.com

Burra History Group has www.burrahistory.info, which is a comprehensive guide to the town for history buffs.

The information on these last two sites far exceeds the Burra Burra Heritage site.

[Andrew then goes on at some length to elaborate on www.visitburra.com.]

‘No doubt your reporter took the lead from a certain National Trust Executive member, who has eyes only for the activities of the National Trust Burra Branch, however, that is no excuse for not doing your homework.’

The site itself has more space taken up by disclaimers than by the history of the town.  While it asks quite rightly for permission and acknowledgement to be given to the Burra National Trust if a person downloads material for commercial purposes, several pictures on it are taken from the Burra Visitor Centre with no acknowledgement.’
