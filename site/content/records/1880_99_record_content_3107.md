Burra School.  Report on the annual Burra School examination for 1880.

New Year’s Eve larrikinism.  There was the overturning of many ‘necessary outbuildings’ connected with cottages all along Thames St.

Mark Gay was fined 40/- for injuring the shutters of Mr J.T. Walker’s shop.

Others were also charged with malicious damage to the property of SAMA.  George Parks, Morris Rabbich and William Lawn were charged with upsetting six closets at the brick row opposite Gebhardt’s shop.  They got off on a technicality that the owner or agent should have been a party to the prosecution if damage was being alleged.  The editor felt that the case should have been adjourned for the owners to have joined the case.
