Burra Defence Rifle Club.  The Government has at last gazetted the Burra Rifle Club and the rifles should soon be received.  The pits for the 200 and 300-yard ranges are being got ready.  Targets will be of shutter design, manipulated from the pit by the marker.  [There is no indication of the site though.]
