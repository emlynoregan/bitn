The Burra Yacht Club has written to the Burra Burra DC expressing concern about the condition of the creek and the lack of public toilets on the eastern bank.  A clean-up was seen as necessary with the approaching Copper Festival in October, for health and safety reasons.  The letter suggested approaching the Department of Tourism for funding for toilets and offered $2,000 towards such a project.  Council agreed to breaching the dam wall and allowing the Yacht Club to proceed with a clean-up with the assistance of Council employees if necessary.  The Department of Tourism will be approached concerning toilets.
