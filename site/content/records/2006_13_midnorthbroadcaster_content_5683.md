Burra Picnic Race Club was forced to close due to crippling insurance costs.  The clubâ€™s remaining funds have now been distributed following a committee meeting at the Royal Exchange Hotel last Tuesday of President David Messenger, Kaye Messenger and John Oates.  Cheques were presented to four community groups: Burra Hospital, Burra Ambulance Service, CFS and Burra Pony Club.  An official wind-up of the Burra Bush Picnic Race Club will be scheduled for a later date.
