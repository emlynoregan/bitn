The Bible Christian Bazaar was opened in the schoolroom yesterday and produced a constant flow of visitors in the afternoon, with crowds at night.  Drapery, millinery, hosiery and many items of female finery were well represented.  Other items included fly-cages, baskets, table mats, doyleys and pin cushions.   All manner of gewgaws were to be had and I believe about Â£80 was taken.  The bazaar continues today.
