Elizabeth A. Ward of Hill St Kooringa writes suggesting a house to house canvas to determine the fate of the Market Square guns.  The parents of our Fallen Soldiers have a right to voice an opinion.  A plate should be fixed to each of the guns describing it with date and place of capture, the name of the battle and the Battalion and Division involved.  This would elevate the guns from being merely ‘pieces of scrap iron’.  To dump them on the banks of the creek would be an insult to our returned men and the memory of ‘Our Glorious Dead’.
