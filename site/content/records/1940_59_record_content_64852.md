Burra Memorial Oval

Progress continues.  The refreshment kiosk on the northwest corner of the ground will be serviceable for the first semi-final of the football, next Saturday, though many fittings remain to be installed and the painting is yet to be done.  The CWA donated Â£55.  [Other donors and helpers are listed.]
