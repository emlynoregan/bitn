Emu Vale News (Black Springs), 14 April

Obituary.  Last Thursday a two-year-old girl died here suddenly just as her mother, who had been left with two children to support, was on the point of going to Kooringa to seek aid for her from Dr Mayne.  She was interred at Apoinga about 6½ miles away after a service by a Wesleyan local preacher.  There is no closer burial ground, though Messrs Duffield and Porter have offered to give an acre of land for the purpose if the settlers will pay for the transfer.  Just as the funeral was about to start Mr Porter came up and said they might have used the new ground as it was all but conveyed to the trustees.

[Jane Bowie Oswell born 8 April 1861 Black Springs: died 10 April 1863 residence Black Springs.]
