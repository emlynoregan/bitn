Alfred Pearce (no relation to any of the Pearce families living in Burra) is also visiting.  He was born in Burra in 1866 and left when 22 years old.  He now lives in Sydney.  He is a son of Mr & Mrs Joseph Pearce, late of Paxton Square.  [This may be true, but he was married in Burra in 1889 and had children here in 1889, 1893 & 1899.]
