Frank West writes from London, having been repatriated from Germany.  After being made a POW he was sent to work in occupied France under allied shellfire at times and also at breaking up French factories.  Also spent three months in hospital.  In December 1917 he was sent to Germany and was in Berlin on 1 December 1917, and then went to Altdamm.  He came to the UK after walking 10 miles to Stettin and taking a boat to Copenhagen and thence to Hull.  Before leaving for Australia at about the end of January 1919 he will spend time with his cousin Herbert and has been to London where he has seen the King & Queen, Queen Alexandra, President Wilson & Lloyd George.
