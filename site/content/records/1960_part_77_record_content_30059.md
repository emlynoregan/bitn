Aberdeen Basketball Club organised an entertainment at the Burra Town Hall on Friday night with Eddie white’s Band from Adelaide and with TV personality Ernie Sigley as guest artist.  315 people attended.  Car troubles delayed Me Sigley’s arrival, but be compensated by performing for the entire evening instead of for a much shorter period.  The evening was a success.
