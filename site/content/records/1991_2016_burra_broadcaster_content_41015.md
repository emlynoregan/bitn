Profile of Joyce Lloyd

Joyce has built a reputation as a star flower arranger in the Mid North.  As a young mother, she was bed-ridden with a debilitating back problem and her husband would bring in flowers she had planted in a wash trough and she would turn them into posies.  This led to flower arranging for her church and then to arrangements for weddings.  Joyce travelled to Adelaide for some tuition at the Floral Society.  She has exhibited at the Burra Show on many occasions and given many talks around the Mid North.  Her arrangements have graced many Burra events over many years.  [Photo.]
