The Directors estimate the total quantity of ore raised in the twelve months to 20 November as 7,200 tons, but as in calculating the small ores retained for smelting at the mine at 1,462 tons, they were greatly below the mark, we may safely revise the estimate to 10,000 tons.  The sales of ore at Swansea already show an average value of something over £23-16-0 per ton, so that even deducting £8-16-0 per ton for carriage, freight and charges, the mine may be said to have yielded at least £150,000 estimated upon the ground, or as the miners say ‘at grass’.  And this within 13 months from commencement.  Nor is this large amount likely to be a maximum.  The mine is undoubtedly equal to the production of 300 tons or more per week of ores likely to yield a much higher average than heretofore.  It is not hard to see the immensity of future returns.

The importance of the operation as beneficially affecting the trade and commerce of the colony may already be judged.  The sum already distributed amongst our industrious settlers for carriage must have exceeded £10,000 and that expended in wages and other disbursements £20,000 and in the British and Colonial freights cannot be less than £15,000.

It is also pleasing to state that not a single fatality has occurred to any miner employed at the Burra Burra Mines since operations began.  This is due to the care of the resident managers to see that every precaution is used and no cost spared in securing the ground, which in some places is precarious enough to call for constant watchfulness.  Stuhl timbers of gum 10-12 inches in diameter were freely provided and stout head and foot pieces.

Productive hands are variously employed – some upon tribute – the highest proportion given being 3/6 in the pound for the value of ores raised, and the lowest 2/-.  Others are paid by the ton for ‘hard ore’, with prices varying from 18/- to 27/6.  Preparatory miners and labourers operate upon what is called tut work or so much per fathom, or in specific jobs or at per day on owners’ account or in labour subsidiary to and chargeable upon the takers or contracting miners below.

A census taken a day or two before we reached the mines revealed 238 men, 70 women and 160 children for a total population of 468.  In addition the mines create other employment in the district for sawyers, carters, charcoal burners etc. and these, it is thought, would bring the district population to about 550.

There is an urgent need for a person with missionary zeal in the community.  The place also needs an exemplary schoolmaster and schoolmistress, who would find themselves sufficiently, if not liberally paid.  ‘It behoves the Directors to take means without delay, for supplying the moral and spiritual wants of the young community, which the Association has called into existence.’

Samuel Stocks Jnr is the Resident Director and is very generally called the ‘Governor’ and his house is called by some ‘Government House’.  It has a substantial stone gable and chimney, which reminds us that the first Government House built for Governor Hindmarsh was begun, if not finished, without such useful appendages.  Mr Stocks has been as markedly successful as he is generally respected.

The surgeon, although well paid by direct stipend and monthly or occasional contributions, has evidently no sinecure and finds it necessary to hold himself in constant requisition.

The mounted police force is only three in number: a sergeant and two constables.  Their conduct is excellent and their temper, management and promptitude most praiseworthy.

The township of Kooringa is principally composed of substantially-built houses, constructed of stone quarried within the township and flagged with excellent material raised (we believe) upon the property of the Association at a distance of a few miles.  That Kooringa will be a very thriving place there can be little doubt.  At first sight the paucity of wood and the lack of visible water supply appear to militate against domestic comfort, but when we learned that the employees of the Association are supplied with water at 6d a week and wood at the like easy rate, we became more convinced that in these as in other respects there was more than met the eye.  An accurate weigh bridge has recently been put down at the mine and every precaution seems to be used to produce a just impression of fairness between master and man.  By the present arrangements the labourer can purchase his weekly requirements wherever he finds he has best advantage.  Although the profits of the Kooringa storekeepers are still good, they have ceased to be exorbitant.

Good stone masons and wallers are in demand at 7/- a day or 4/6 per cubic yard, finding their own materials.  Mason’s labourers earn 5/- a day.  Carpenters are paid 35 to 45 shillings a week and Sawyers 10/6 a hundred.  Carriage to the port is £2-15-0 per ton of 21 cwt.  There is no lack of carriers.  Monday presentation is nothing short of 60 drays and 360 bullocks.  The charcoal on hand fills a charcoal store 150 ft in length by 27 ft in width.

We closed our observations at Burra Burra with an examination of the contiguous property called “the Sydney Company’s” at which little has been done and then prepared for departure on the morrow.

At noon on Tuesday we set out for the southern portion of the Special Survey of 20,000 acres, on which is located the Princess Royal Mine.  About 30 men are there employed and something more than 200 tons of good ores have been sent.  It appeared that with a little more spirit and perseverance 2,000 and then 20,000 tons might follow.  We inspected as many of the shafts as time allowed and especially the one sunk upon the original ‘monster lode’ upon the margin of a forest of stunted pine.  ‘The fast possession of abundant treasure is decisive, although it is not so instantly tangible as at the Burra Burra.’  A beautiful lawn was pointed out as the intended site for the Princess Royal Township, which will have the advantage of an excellent supply of water from a neighbouring spring.  The present snug establishment is pleasantly located on the Burra Creek.

The route from Kooringa to Princess Royal and then south traverses the creek for several miles and then crosses an abrupt, but comparatively insignificant ridge called ‘the Saddle’ through which a passage has been cut and then it follows a flat.  We venture to say that 50 of the 100 miles from Adelaide to Burra Burra would travel over very easy grades with the capacity for cheap construction.  We encamped the night at Tothill’s Gap, where we found several drays going to or returning from the mines.  At 5.15 a.m. we were on the move and made our way through one of Mr Dutton’s sheep stations to the Light.  This we crossed at a point far removed from that on our northbound journey and we passed the woolshed of Messrs Newland & Co. to reach Kapunda.

The Kapunda is a wonderful mine.  The underground workings are for the greater part suspended in consequence of the insufficiency of the principal whim machinery for keeping under the water and the non-arrival of a steam engine ordered from England by the proprietors.  Some 60-70 tons per week at an average of mere than £20 per ton are even now sent from this rich mine.  The kinds of ore produced her offer a remarkable variety, comprising grey sulphuret with green carbonate producing 50% or more, black sulphuret with green carbonate 23-60%, pale green carbonate 26-48%, blue carbonate (hydrocarbonate) 20-30%, grey carbonate with red oxide 28%, dark green carbonate 30% and others of lesser value.  The location is picturesque.

Mr J.B. Hack is the resident Superintendent and the mine has the appearance of good management.  Single miners are provided with board and lodging at 10/- per week.  The much wanted inn about a mile from the mine is now nearly ready for occupation and it is to be hoped that the intervening country between it and Gawler Town will not long be without a half-way house.

At Gawler Town we found the first annual races had commenced.  Attendance, though not large, was greater than we expected to find.  A number of Aborigines were present and a German brass band whose members were also miners.

Since our return we have spoken to a man who says Mt Remarkable copper exhibits abundance and all that can be desired for quality and the riches at Emu Springs are described as almost indescribable.  Mt Barker and the eastern districts are said to have undoubted riches too.
