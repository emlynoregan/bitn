Sydney Clarence Willmott aged 7 said that the man had said to him when they got outside that ‘It is only Fred Gebhardt’.  [He also said that he knew another Fred Gebhardt who worked at the baker’s.]

Frederick Gebhardt, station overseer, gave evidence which said he was just passing the Willmott house when he encountered the young boy.  Mrs Willmott had approached him with regard to a settlement as she feared losing her boy to the State Children’s Dept.  He denied offering money to quash the case.
