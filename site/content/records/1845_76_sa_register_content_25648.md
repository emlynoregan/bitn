16 May 1874, page 6

Hallett.  12 May.  The district has shared in the timely rains lately.

Professor Askull gave an entertainment on the 8th inst. At the Windygoleeche Hotel [sic].  He was fairly patronised and the performance of his dogs gave great amusement.

Mr P. Ferrier has retired as landlord of the hotel.

The school, which was started recently has collapsed â€“ a regrettable event. A good master is sadly needed.

The nearest school is five miles away at Ulooloo.
