Obituary.  Mrs W. West died at Burra Burra Mines at quarter to ten Thursday evening, 26 October.  She was the eldest daughter of the late Edmund Joiner, Inspector of County Police, Petworth, Sussex, where she was born 12 April 1838.  In January 1858 she sailed with her sister from London in the Stately and arrived in May 1858.  In November 1858 she came to Burra as companion to the late Mrs Mauran and in April 1859 was married by Rev. R.C. Flockhart, Wesleyan minister at Kooringa, to William West, present manager of the SAMA estate at Burra.  For some years she and her husband engaged in teaching at Redruth.  In 1873 Mr West gave up teaching and became an official on the staff of SAMA.  In 1891-92 she was Mayoress of Burra and loyally and efficiently assisted her husband in his duties.  On November 30 1892 she christened the new bridge in Aberdeen ‘The Bon Accord Bridge’. 

By her gentle demeanour, unostentatious manner, sterling integrity and amiable disposition she made many friends.  Her illness manifested itself six months ago and required a severe operation and through the skilled attention of Dr Sangster she recovered from its effects and it was hoped she would be restored to health, but unfortunately about six weeks ago the return of the disease manifested itself.  She was buried on Saturday at Kooringa, her funeral being largely attended.  Rev. S. Casely officiated.  As well as a husband, Mr William West, she leaves five sons and three daughters:

Charles Leonard West (Councillor for West Ward)

Alfred Earnest West (Operator at GPO, Adelaide)

Horace Edmund West (Clerk at the Adelaide Railway Forwarding Goods Department)

Joshua James West (Commercial Master, Whinham College, North Adelaide)

Henry Howard West (Clerk, Jamestown Railway Station)

Mrs R.A. Cilento of Jamestown

Miss Harriet and Miss Alice Emily West (Both at home)

There are eight grandchildren.
