When a deputation of the unemployed waited on the Council they were informed that the Council was sending a deputation to the Government to urge them to carry out the proposed water scheme at the Black Waterholes and to re-open the Aberdeen Ballast Quarry.  Rev. W.G.M. Murphy invited the Council to attend the Peace service next Sunday afternoon at St Mary’s and this was accepted.
