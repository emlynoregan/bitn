Obituary.  Mr Thomas McBride died at New Mile End on 5 January.  He was born at ‘The Gums’ [11 February 1871] then owned by his late father James Martin McBride.  He was the fourth son and was aged 68.  He spent his life as a pastoralist, much of it as the owner of Redcliffe.  Ill health forced his retirement about six months ago.  He married Miss Rose Bullen a daughter of the late Mr and Mrs Bullen of Kooringa who survives with a family of ten, seven sons and three daughters: Reuben (WA), Clem & Claude (Adelaide), Jim (Eudunda), Keith (Redcliffe), Charles (Mt Pleasant), Geoffrey (Adelaide), Dot Mrs T.H. Reynolds, Cora Mrs H. Webb (WA) & Sylvia Mrs S. Bull (WA).  The eldest son Lieut. Norman McBride was killed in Palestine in the Great War.  There are a number of grandchildren.
