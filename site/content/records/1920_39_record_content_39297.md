Obituary.   Mrs Ann Jordan died at her residence on 13 September aged 98.  She was born at Enniskillen, Ireland 3 September 1834.  [Which would make her 97.]  She left Liverpool in 1855 in the Bucephalus and spent her 21st birthday on the water, arriving in Adelaide on 13 October.  On the same ship were Mr & Mrs James M. McBride.  Soon after arriving she married Mr John Lavoun and the following year came to this district by bullock dray with a six-week old infant.  They lived first at ‘Hillside’ about five miles north of Aberdeen, owned then by Mr Hallett and later by Mr Young.  Mr Lavoun died in 1880 leaving his widow with eight children.  His wife acted as a maternity nurse for many years and in 1885 married Mr George Jordan who died many years ago. [1900]  In her early life she was a Wesleyan, but for the past 48 years had been a staunch member of the Salvation Army and was some years ago awarded the ‘Long Service Badge’.  On her recent birthday she responded sweetly to the congratulations and was pleased to receive a visit from one of her ‘babies’ Mt I.J. Warnes.  In recent years she has been cared for by Miss Louie Lavoun who with her only surviving sister Mary (Mrs Cryer of Adelaide) was with he mother at the end.

[Born Ann Trotter.]
