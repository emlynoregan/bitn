Weather

On Sunday last 1 December the district experienced one of the worst dust storms for some time.

The morning was hot and humid and towards midday it grew thundery with a red haze.  About 5.45 p.m. the wind rose to a gale and enveloped the district in dense red dust.  After a few moments there was thunder and lightning followed by a downpour of 16 points.

At Farrell’s Flat at 6 p.m. a cyclone swept over Harold Atkins’ farm near Porter’s Lagoon doing great damage to sheds.  Some 30 gum trees, with trunks at least a foot in diameter, were snapped off about two feet from the ground.  A sheaved hay stack, which had stood since 1915, disappeared without trace.  A shed 120 ft long lost half its roof and timber and iron were hurled around like matches.  One piece of timber 14 ft x 4 inches x 3 inches was carried 100 yards and pierced the roof of another building.  Mrs Atkins was caught outside getting some kindling, and unable to return to the house, sought refuge in the cellar.

At F.H. Reed’s on the turn-off to Flagstaff Hill, a shed roof was carried 60 yards and very large gums were snapped off.  Telegraph poles along the railway were partially blown over.

[This ‘cyclone’ would now be described as a tornado.]
