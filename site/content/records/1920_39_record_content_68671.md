The Smelts Chimney.  For some time the 60ft chimney has been regarded as unsafe and the Council has now decided it should be demolished.  Arthur D. Jordan, attending the Burra School, once climbed to the top.  He is now one of Gawler’s most prominent businessmen and a nephew of C.J. Pearce of Burra.  Most old timers are sorry to see it go, as it has stood as a silent indication of Burra’s great activities in the 1850s & 1860s.
