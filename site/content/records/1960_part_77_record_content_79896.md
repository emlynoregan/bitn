Hockey.  The second semi-final was a protracted affair.  At the end of normal time the match between Burra and Roseworthy was drawn at 3 goals each.  Two extra five minute halves left the scores unchanged.  Five penalty strokes followed and brought the scores to 4 goals each.  After a further five penalty strokes Burra 6 eventually defeated Roseworthy 4 and so moves into the grand-final.
