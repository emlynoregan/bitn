Burra Skate Park

Plans for the location and development of the park have been approved by Goyder Council.  The project is expected to commence in mid-2013.  The project has been a dream for the past seven years and YAC has raised $80,000 to date, including $60,000 through community donations and YAC functions etc.  Council will provide additional funding support with the total cost estimated at $180,000.  Development is due to start in June or July on the site of the existing skate ramp on the eastern side of the Burra Creek by the Town Hall and Art Gallery.

Plans include concrete skate ramps, landscaping, a car park upgrade and stone-filled baskets as reinforcing barriers along the creek bank.  The designers are Civil Tech Engineering which was responsible for the popular Clare Skate Park.  Although the park will be located in an area of heritage sites, it will be unobtrusive and tasteful.
