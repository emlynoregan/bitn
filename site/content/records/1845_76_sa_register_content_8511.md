Kooringa News

On Monday last a parting dinner was given by Mr Chambers to his Kooringa friends upon his retiring from his extensive business as a mail contractor.  Unfortunately his health prevented him from presiding on the occasion.  He was ably represented by Mr Parnell.  There were 20-30 guests representing the trade, mining, smelting and farming interests of the district.  Among those present were Mr Chambers, Captain Roach, Rev. Pollitt, Mr Humphries, Mr Challoner, Mr Sims (who is one of the purchasers of Mr Chambers’ mail plant), Mr Robinson, Dr Hill & Mr Drew.  The Chairman gave a speech stressing the determined spirit that had seen Mr Chambers triumph as a mail contractor all over the colony.  His perseverance had banished ‘cannot’ and replaced it with ‘it must be done’ and as a result the mail arrived with remarkable regularity.  He hoped this worthy example would be taken up by his successors.  He had earned the esteem and friendship of all who knew him.  He hoped he would long be spared to enjoy the fruits of the fortune he had so hardly and honourably gained.  Mr Chambers responded and proposed ‘Success to Messrs Sims and Hayter’. [His successors.]

[BISA suggests he was James (Jemmy) Chambers who was born 26 September 1812 at Enfield, London, UK and died 7 August 1862 at North Adelaide.  He was survived by his wife and six children.]
