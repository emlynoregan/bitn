Pekina Hall/Institute was built in 1906 and was taken over by the Catholic Church in 1936.  It had a wide variety of uses – dances, school concerts, travelling pi shows, farewells and welcomes of WWI & WWII service personnel, deb balls, wedding receptions and so on, until the late 1970s.  Orroroo DC took it over in 1983 and Malcolm McKinnon bought it in 1989 and renovated it as his home.  It has been open to the public several times and last Saturday the owners welcomed visitors to a celebration dance marking the building’s centenary.
