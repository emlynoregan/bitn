Burra Burra Show Inc. AGM

The date for this year’s show will be 7 October.

M.G. Stockman was re-elected President for a third term.  Mr Rex Stockman was elected Senior Vice-President and Mr R. Mason is the Junior Vice-President.  G. Stanley Hawker is the Patron.  The distribution of electricity on the grounds has to be reorganised because of the unsafe condition of existing poles.  A sub-committee will go into the matter and various other matters relating to improving the show were considered.  It was decided to ask the minister of Agriculture Mr Bywaters to open the 1967 show, or failing him, Mr C.R. Kelly MHR.  A minute of appreciation was recorded for the services of Mr H.J.B. Jennison over a long period.  He had earlier indicated he would like to retire from the committee in favour of a younger member.

The President reported a successful 1966 show, held in perfect weather with a total of 2,450 entries.  Horses in Action remained a highlight.  Numbers were down on the previous year’s record, but quality was much in evidence.  Wool entries were up with the best types in the district.  The Sheep Pavilion was nicely filled and young breeders are to be commended for entering.

The Flower Pavilion was a picture despite some rough weather in the days leading up to the show.  Mrs Scroop and Mr R. Fuss are congratulated on the painting of the walls and tables.

District schools produced a fine display.  Industrial displays were numerous and comprehensive.  The Agricultural Pavilion was well filled with quality produce.  Dog and goat entries were of a high standard and poultry and birds were well represented as usual.

The death during the year of Mr A.B. Riggs is the loss of a valued member.  He was a life member and past president who did a great deal to support the show over many years.  Thanks to the new secretaries Mr & Mrs A. Graham, who learned fast and did a fine job.

Financially the show was a success and the overdraft is being slowly reduced.
