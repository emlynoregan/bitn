The Mayor presided.  He reported that a survey of the town a year ago revealed so many urgent works demanded attention that no new major projects could be undertaken.  The Caravan Park has thus been held in abeyance and improvements to the Dept and other matters have not materialised.  There is a task ahead to attend to minor repairs.  The town has many bridges and wooden fences, which need to be kept in repair.  The wooden posts in the fence to Burra North are being replaced with cement ones.  The bridges have, as yet, received little attention.  Attention has been paid to back roads or lesser used roads, including those in Burra North, like St Just St and roads in Millerton.  Smelts Road was repaired, but with a dry spell needs further attention.

The Cemetery curator resigned this year and was replaced by Mr W. Broad.  The truck required a new engine at a cost of £264-3-5.  An auto-scythe was purchased to save time and money in cleaning watertables.  Cedar trees in Thames St have been lopped and are again growing well without berries.

Negotiations were begun with ETSA and, if successful, Burra could have ETSA electricity by 1953.

The Housing Trust builders are erecting six Trust Homes in Burra.

The efforts of the Board of Health have brought about new sewage systems at Burra Hotel and Burra School.

The Mayor appealed for more interest in civic affairs and was disappointed that so few attended the meeting.  He concluded by paying tribute to Cr Jennison, who was retiring after being connected with the Council since 1931.

He reminded everyone that this year marked the 75th anniversary of the town becoming a Corporate Town.  He said the town was in a fairly sound financial position despite rising costs.

H.C. Davies, as candidate for North Ward, said that as a comparative newcomer he was taking an interest because he intended to stop in the town.  Les White, his rival for the North Ward seat, said he would do his best for the Ward and for the town as a whole.

Cr Pritchard said he was proud of the Council’s achievements and would continue to do his best if returned.  Mr Lott, who will oppose Mr Pritchard, was unable to be present.
