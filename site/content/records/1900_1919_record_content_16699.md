The Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co.  The tributers have ceased to work in the open cut.  A visit on Monday found the place almost deserted, but for one man.  The pumping machinery is not yet ready to work.  It is not known how long it will take to pump out, but it is hoped to start within a fortnight.  It is expected some 30,000 gallons an hour will flow down the creek and it is the intention of some men to be allowed to fossick in the creek.

[The tone of the whole report is one of extreme scepticism.]
