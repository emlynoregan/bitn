West Burra Copper Mining Co. has also been floated with Â£2,500 in 25,000 shares.  An underlie shaft has been sunk on the course of the lode.  The lode is of good rich veins of 30-40% ore.  With modern machinery and the present price of copper these mines could be successful and could induce the re-opening of the old Burra Mine, which has large deposits of 3-19% ore.
