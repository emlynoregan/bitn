Opening of the New Anglican Rectory by Ven. Archdeacon Bussell of Adelaide on 3 November.

It had long been a desire to have a rectory closer to the church.  Under the old law it had been impossible to sell the old Rectory at Redruth, but under the new law it could be done.  The present purchase was effected in 1919 and it was thought best to pause due to high prices, but they persisted and in April a contract was awarded to T.H. Woollacott & F.M. Pearce to do the work.  Work started on 18 May and the first stone was laid 4 June and was practically completed on 6 November. [sic – a rather strange comment to make on 3 November!]  The cost was a little over £2,000.  They had in hand £800 from the sale of the old rectory and £100 from a legacy of the late Mr F.T. Jones of Mongolata.  £200 would come from the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel when final payment was made.  The debt at present was then approximately £1,000.  Mr Winnall said it was strange there had been such opposition from some quarters – first over the selling of the old rectory, then over the price received for it and then complaints over the new site.  Now the time had come for everyone to pull together.
