Burra Racing Club’s meeting at Balaklava last Wednesday was the biggest ever organised by the club.  It was held there due to alterations being made to the club’s own track.  Acceptances were high and the attendance large.  In future Burra will have a very good track and, if there was a bituminised road to Burra, could expect to draw a large crowd.  The bookmakers turned over about £67,500, about three times as much as at a Burra meeting.  The main race was the Squatters’ Handicap over 1¼ miles, won by Dolcetto, ridden by W. Pyers and owned by Messrs W. Hill-Smith & C.A. Haigh.

The Chairman of the Burra Club is Gerald Gask and the Secretary is Reg. Davey.  Andrew Tennant is the Patron.  Mr Gask said work on the new section of track at Burra was well in hand and all should be ready for the October meeting.
