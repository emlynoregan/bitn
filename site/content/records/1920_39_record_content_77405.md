Burra Swimming Pool

The Committee told the Mayor they had £150 in hand and the international situation had prevented their adding much to it, consequently there was only about £550 in cash to build a £1,000 pool and they recommended a twelve month extension of time.

The Mayor said he could hardly do that when Cudlee Creek had opened a pool for £700 and so had Tanunda.  He suggested that if he could get the unemployed to raise screenings etc. he would check out Tanunda over the holidays and see what could be done.  The plans the committee had could not be built under £2,000 and if £700 was good enough for Tanunda it was good enough for Burra.

The Council resolved to hold the matter over till 15 January 1949.
