The Chess & Draughts Club was successfully run last year.

The year ended with a credit in the Savings Bank account of £48-13-3 ‘but this is counterbalanced by a balance due to State Bank, interest and principal due October 1 1930 of £47-13-11.

[It is not clear from the statement whether this had been met or whether it was to be paid and so ‘counterbalanced the Savings Bank sum very closely.]

Gilbert & Sullivan’s Pirates of Penzance was staged by the Institute Orchestral & Choral Classes on 2 & 3 December and was an unqualified success.

Elected were President, L.S. Penrose; Vice-President, G.E. Dane; Treasurer, M.W. Bednall; Secretary, E.J. Harris.
