Burra Town Council.

The Mayor, Mr Holder, proposed a plan to aid the unemployed which is really work that is required and not charity.

He proposed to create a Jubilee Avenue by employing a number of men for a few days each over a period of 2-3 months to plant the east side of the road from the Mine Bridge to Kooringa at 5/- a day.

What is first needed is for the Midland Road Board to define the western edge of the road so that the eastern edge can be measured off.  Secondly the present cutting of the western side has to be carried back to its true place from one to four feet behind where it is now.  A footpath then has to be cut ten feet from the boundary line.  This will provide enough filling for the eastern side embankment.

A double line of post and wire fence will be needed to enclose the footway on the eastern side.  On each side of the footway there will be a row of trees - say sugar gums on the creek side and white cedars on the roadside.  Ultimately the fence on the roadside can be removed and only the creek side one left.  The distance is 26 chains from the Mine Bridge to Mr Lockyer’s house.  Mr Holder estimated the cost as follows:

Cutting	25

Levelling	5

Fencing	35

Planting	   5

Total	£70

Trees can be had from the Forest Board.  The money to be raised by Public Subscription and Entertainments.

This was published in the form of a memorandum so the Council could be aware of it before the Council meeting next Monday.
