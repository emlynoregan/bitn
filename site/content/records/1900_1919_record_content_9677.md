The Season has started well with excellent rains and green grass everywhere, even out east where feed has been a novelty for the past seven years.  The rain last week was so heavy in some places that the railway north of Burra was washed away and several trains were late getting to Burra.  Locally falls were steady and soaking and were absorbed into the ground.
