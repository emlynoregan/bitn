The Seaside Trip to Glenelg was held last Saturday.  The morning was cold in Burra and also in Glenelg.  The lack of platforms at Glenelg was somewhat inconvenient, but the railways provided stepladders.  Many people went to Adelaide instead of the beach, but others went to the amusements like the merry-go-round, the big wheel, swinging boats and the shooting gallery.

The start from Burra was marred by a crush on the platform and hoodlum-like behaviour by some young men who pushed through regardless of comfort and safety.  There were 1,000 people to accommodate and the use of different coloured tickets for the two trains would have helped.  The failure of the railways to provide sufficiently powerful engines for the return journey meant the run home was two hours late.  The first train arrived at 1.40 a.m. and the second at 2 a.m.  But overall, except for the road accident at the start and the late arrival and the slow journey home, most people had a good dayâ€™s outing.
