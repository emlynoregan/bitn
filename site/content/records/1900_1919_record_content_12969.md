Burra Waterworks.  Mr Fenwick was in Burra last week assessing properties.  He visited 995 houses.

[This is an extraordinary number of houses: in 1921 the census returns show 422 occupied houses for 1777 people.  In 1901 the population was 1994: it seems unlikely the extra 217 people needed an extra 573 houses!]
