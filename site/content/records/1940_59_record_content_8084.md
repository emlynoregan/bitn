CWA International Day was held in Burra last Friday.  Mrs C.A. Hutchinson, wife of the American Consul, was the guest speaker, since USA was the focus for this year.  The CWA Rest Room was totally inadequate for the occasion and the meeting was held at the Masonic supper room and entrance hall.  Another guest was Mrs E. Morrison, a leading worker at the Cheer-Up Hut in Adelaide.  The hall was decorated with red roses, the emblem flower of Columbia.  Mrs Max Pearce led off with a rendering of the American National Anthem.  Mrs Hutchinson spoke of her nationâ€™s history, emblems and traditions, such as Thanksgiving Day.  She ended with a discussion of what American women were contributing to the war effort.  [She is reported at length.]
