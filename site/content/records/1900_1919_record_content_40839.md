Obituary.  Nicholas Dunstan Bennett died suddenly at Nailsworth on Saturday.  The deceased was born at Constantine, Norfolk in 1834 and arrived in Adelaide in January 1856 on the Marion after a voyage of 113 days.  He went to the Victorian diggings for five months before coming to work in the Burra Mine.  Later he opened a school at Black Springs and in 1859 took charge of the Government school at Redruth and in 1860 bought the goodwill of Mr Forderâ€™s school.  Five years later he became clerk of Moonta Local Court and filled various Government positions for the next 27 years, retiring in 1892 to Nailsworth.  Four sons and one daughter survive: A.D. Bennett, Dr T.C. Bennett, Dr A.H. Bennett (Hampstead), C.E. Bennett (Adelaide) and Mrs Bennett Willinson [sic: for Wilkinson] (Perth).  [Died 20 February 1915 at Prospect aged 80.]
