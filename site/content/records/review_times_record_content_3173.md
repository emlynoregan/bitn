The school hopes to launch its Jubilee 150 book Relatively Speaking during the Copper Festival in October.  Principal Mr Roger Henderson said the school was seeking a sponsor to pay the $13,000 it will need to produce 1,000 copies of the book.  The book is in the final stages of preparation.  About 690 contributors from students at Burra Community School, and from Mt Bryan, Booborowie and Hallett Schools have prepared work for it.  Entries are either historical memories of families or contemporary observations, which will be of future historic interest.  Information is listed alphabetically by family and includes photographs.  Louisa Fidock of BCS has won the competition to design the cover.
