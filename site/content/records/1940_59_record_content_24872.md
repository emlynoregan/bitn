Burra Town Council has a trailer pump and 1,000 feet of hose and other accessories on indefinite loan from the Civil Defence Force.  Their only expense is the erection of a shed 10 feet by 12 feet near the existing Fire Station to house the equipment.  They have decided to house it in the Ambulance Shed.  It was demonstrated to an interested audience by Mr T.J. Meaney, Deputy Director of the EFS.

[The equipment is then listed and a description of the demonstration is printed.]
