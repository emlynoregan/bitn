A Trip to the North

The trip to Kapunda by train is rendered tedious by the wearisome stoppages and slow advances, so that a trip that should take 1½ hours for the 50 miles can take two or even three hours.

Gawler seemed very dull.  Business was very quiet and there was a feeling of general depression.

At Kapunda had breakfast at the Sir John Franklin and bought a ticket for Clare in a strongly-built Cobb & Co. coach behind four capital horses.  However, we soon left the made road for a jolting tumbling and rocking ride through an adjoining station for some five or six hours.

‘Nothing in its way can exceed the nonchalance of the coachman.  He makes his horses plunge headlong over crevices and ruts which would cause a nervous lady to shriek and even a bold driver to be cautious.’

Clare was full of talk about the railway from Pt Wakefield.  Clare district farmers this season are paying 35/- a ton cartage to Yorke Peninsula compared with 50/- previously and this has enabled them to compete with the Adelaide shippers to the Peninsula.  Fruit, vegetables and dairying would flourish here is transport costs were lowered and such id the potential of a tramway.  Wool would also benefit by a connection with Pt Wallaroo.

After two or three days in Clare, I set out for Burra.  For twenty miles of dreary landscape I saw one man driving a team of horses and another mending a fence.

‘My approach to the Burra was not at all calculated to prepossess me in its favour.’  A few drops of rain fell, followed by a strong easterly and clouds of dust, before the shower began in earnest.  Burra was in a sad state, the last of the men at the mines having just been dismissed.

‘Family after family were bidding adieu to the place which had been their home for years, while one after another disappointed and crestfallen were returning from their ill considered journey to the Barrier Ranges.’

The general thought was that the only thing to save Burra was the construction of the railway.  In that all seemed to concur.  It is not debated, but seen as an absolute necessity.  Total abandonment of the place is seen as the alternative.

I left at daybreak the following morning for Clare.

[The writer then describes his journey to Yorke Peninsula at great length.  He visited Kadina and Wallaroo (but not Moonta) before returning to Adelaide.]
