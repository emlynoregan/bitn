The 3rd son of E.N. Finch had been suffering from earache and recently Dr Sangster removed a piece of lead pencil from his ear.  Mr Finch said he remembered the incident when the pencil got into his ear some five years ago.  [The son was Edwin Finch who would have been a few weeks short of 20 at the time.]
