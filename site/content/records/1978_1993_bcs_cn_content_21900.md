BCS.  Due to uncertainty of enrolments it seems the Boarding House facility will not continue after this year.

BCS.  The guest speaker for Speech Day will be Elizabeth Mansutti.  She has much experience in children’s TV including a period as producer of ‘Mulligrubs’.  She is also a member of the Public Libraries Board of SA.  She will address the theme of literacy.
