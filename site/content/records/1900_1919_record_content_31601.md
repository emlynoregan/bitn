Supreme Court Adelaide.

The trial of Martha Gully has finally come off.  She was charged with having obtained two hats, valued at £1-11-0, by false pretences.

‘The jury, after a brief retirement, returned a verdict of guilty [sic] and the accused was discharged.’

[Presumably the verdict was, as the headline said, ‘NOT GUILTY’.]

[Details of the case are a repeat of earlier reports and occupy about ½ column.]
