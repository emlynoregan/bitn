Eastern Telephone Syndicate.

Some time ago a private syndicate erected a telephone line some 100 miles to Quondong, connecting en route Sturt Vale, Old Koomooloo, Koomooloo, Woolgangi & Baldina.  To the west connections were also made to Wahroonga and Leighton.  Since the initial line was constructed extensions have been made to Caroona & Mongolata to the northeast and Redcliffe to the southeast.  Braemar and Faraway Hill have been connected and a line has been extended to Oakbank from Quondong.  Mr I.J. Warnes of Wahroonga is chairman and Mr W.H. Hardy is secretary and telephonist at Kooringa.
