Obituary.  Mr Alexander Balfour Feltus died suddenly at Mongolata last Wednesday.  He would have been 79 on 23 August.  He was a man of fine physique, well read and well informed.  About six years ago he married the widow Mrs W. (Nurse) Woollacott, widow of the late W. Woollacott of Redruth.  He at once identified himself with the Redruth Methodist Church and was a most acceptable local preacher.  He took up a claim at Mongolata about four miles from Byles’.  His knowledge and experience of such work he gave freely to others and, as prior to coming to Burra he had been a blacksmith, he had a number of such jobs brought to his ‘humpie’ for attention.  On Tuesday he seemed his usual self and on returning to his little home he seems to have sharpened a number of tools ha had been given to attend to.  A fellow prospector found him dead in his bunk at about 1 p.m. on Wednesday.  M-C Boyce and the Mayor T.H. Woollacott went out to investigate.  They found the place all neat and tidy.  The deceased had had breakfast and washed up.  All his tools were piled up ready for a day’s work.  Evidently he had felt unwell and had lain down and peacefully died from heart failure.  Before coming to Burra Mr Feltus had lived at Belalie, where he had a blacksmithing business and other property.  He leaves a widow and a son and daughter resident in NSW.

[Born 23 August 1856, Woodville (but not registered): died 21 August 1835 Mongolata, resident Redruth.]
