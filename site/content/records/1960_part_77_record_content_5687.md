Ron Dewhirst writes a long letter running about 1¼ columns suggesting that following the north Eastern Football League’s decision not to admit Aberdeen to the ‘A’ Grade and to continue with a League of four teams, the best solution would be for a ‘B’ Grade competition or a Colts competition.  Two ‘A’ Grade teams is more than one town could maintain.  When he first came to the district Booborowie had three and then for several years it had two and so did Burra and Spalding, but population has fallen with young people going to the city and all three towns have difficulty fielding one strong team.  A strong competition could not have been sustained with two teams in one town.  He does not believe four teams too few for a league and most country leagues have only four teams.  He feels ‘B’ Grade would be a better solution than Colts teams.  With a Colt age limit of 18 a lad reaching 18 is deprived of a game if he is not quite good enough for the ‘A’ team.  A ‘B’ team would solve this problem (or a Colts team without age limit).  The possibility of interchange between ‘A’ & ‘B’ teams would also make ‘A’ team players look to their laurels.
