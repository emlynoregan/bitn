James J.H. Young editor of The Chemist and Druggist of Australia visited Burra on Monday.  He is a brother to Mrs T. Woollacott Sen. and uncle to the Mayor.  He was born at Copperhouse in 1859, the family moving to Burra in 1860.  He began his Chemistry studies under Doctors Dashwood and Cave prior to the establishment of T.W. Wilkinson & Co. and when that firm came along he served a short apprenticeship with it.  He left Burra in 1877 and after experience in Adelaide opened the firm of Young’s Pharmacy there, which still exist though he later sold it to go to Tyabb in Victoria to attend to his mother’s estate.  He is still there.  He recalls the opening of the Burra railway in 1870 and took much interest in Frank Treloar’s articles Looking Back.  He much admired the tree planting in the town since he left.  His brother Harry served his time as a printer in The Record office under Sir Frederick Holder.
