The Burra Branch of the Dressmaking Class went into recess on Friday afternoon.  There are 86 members on the roll and Mrs Ainley from the School of Mines was present to examine the work which reflects well on the teacher, Miss Summerton.  The students have done well over the twelve months, but Mrs Ainley was sorry to see no equivalent class for boys.
