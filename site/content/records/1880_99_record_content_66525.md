John Bennet, whilst drunk on Saturday, threw the contents of a kettle over his wife and then a saucepan of soup.  She was all the time nursing a baby.

‘Unfortunately, however, the innocent little creature seemed to have a Providential escape . . .’ [sic!!]

He was fined £1 for being drunk and an assault charge is pending.
