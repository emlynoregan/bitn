Boer War.  The Mayor called a meeting for 26 September at which a committee was formed with Rev. W.F. James as secretary to decide how to aid the National Memorial Fund.  On 19 October there is to be a lecture and musical program in aid of the fund.  Local shops will be asked to close at 8 p.m. to allow assistants and themselves to attend.  The Editor of the Burra Record has been asked to open a 1/- subscription list and has agreed.  The fund aims to provide a suitable memento to the heroism of the many South Australians who fought in the South African War and to keep in remembrance those who lost their lives.
