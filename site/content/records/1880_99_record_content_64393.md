The Cinematographe.  Mr Reeve presented his show on Friday and Saturday.  He is fighting an uphill battle against the very inferior machines travelling the country and turning people off the Cinematographe, but his reputation hold s good and the pictures shown here were really good and several had to be repeated.  The gramophone too assisted in passing an enjoyable evening.
