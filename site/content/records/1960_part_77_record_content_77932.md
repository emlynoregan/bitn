Burra National Trust held its AGM on 9 February.

Retiring President G.E. O’Connor reported.

The Federal Government’s National Estate program provided $12,000 in a grant, but it had to be spent in two months, which meant it could not be used to best advantage.  Work done was:

The Bon Accord Engine Shop was half re-roofed and the building repainted satisfactorily after Mr Cockington had condemned the contractor’s first efforts.  Drainage was improved on the southern side.

Restoration of the second dugout was commenced as a voluntary project, but when $2,500 became available it was contracted to G. Nourse and D. Cockington.  Some work remains to be done.

$3,800 was allocated for the restoration of the old Powder Magazine.  The first contractor withdrew over a dispute concerning the quality of work and it was completed by Don Villis.  The western wall (previously dismantled) was rebuilt and the eastern wall of the magazine itself was removed.  The building is secure, but much more needs to be done.  After we had spent the money it was discovered that the Powder Magazine was not National Trust Property, which upset National Estate authorities because the funds were only to be spent on Trust owned properties.  It was finally resolved by the Council giving the Trust control of the property by means of a covenant.

We have found that local contractors give greater satisfaction than outsiders.

Ian Auhl published two beautiful books during the year.

Late in the year the Diamond T fire engine that served the town from 1937-75 was offered for sale by the Fire Brigade Board and was snapped up by the District Council who sold it to the National Trust.

Our first ever organised dinner in December 1974 at the Kooringa Hotel was well attended and very satisfactory.

[The retiring President G.R. O’Connor also acknowledged the support of all volunteers, Mr Woollacott, the District Council and the Federal Government for their respective support.]
