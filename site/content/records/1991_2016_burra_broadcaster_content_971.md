Peter Reith, Shadow Treasurer and Deputy Opposition Leader, spoke at a well-attended meeting at the Burra Sporting Complex on 17 October.  Over 160 people gathered to hear him explain the Coalitionâ€™s Fightback package, including the Goods and Services Tax.  He compared the proposal with the present Wholesale Sales Tax at varying rates on a wide range of goods.  The uniform GST would simplify this by removing seven taxes, including the Wholesale Sales Tax, payroll tax and fuel excise.  Personal income tax would fall and there would be increases in the family allowance, social security benefits and pensions.  The average increase in sales tax due to the GST would be about 4% because of the removal of the existing wholesale taxes etc.
