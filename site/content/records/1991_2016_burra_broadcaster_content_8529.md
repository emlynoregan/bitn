Letter.  Ian Auhl writes concerning an invitation for Professor Blainey to speak at Burra on 9 December.  He says he has been aware of Blainey’s importance to Burra since reading his book The Rush That Never Ended in 1964 – which first impressed upon him that Kapunda and Burra were Australia’s first mining towns.  Blainey’s first contribution was to substantiate Auhl’s submission to the SA Government to have the whole of Paxton Square placed under the protection of the Historic Relics Act (1965).  Blainey also gave Auhl permission to use his words ‘Australia’s Earliest Mining Era’ as the title for one of Auhl’s books in 1970.  Auhl doubts if his research and submissions concerning the various historic sites would have proceeded without Blainey’s inspiration.  Without Blainey’s insight, it is likely Burra would have remained a sleepy old town, almost unaware of its significance to SA history and it is doubtful if it would have become a Proclaimed Historic Town.

[This and rather more in a long letter.]
