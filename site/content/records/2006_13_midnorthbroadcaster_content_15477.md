The World Copper Project will see delegates from around the world converge on Burra next week for a conference.  It will bring together scholars who are working on the history of the copper industry and its heritage.  Last year’s conference was held at Swansea and in 2013 a conference will be held at Santiago in Chile.  Between 1830 and 1870 the Swansea district in South Wales became the hub of the world’s first globally integrated heavy industry.  The copper smelters there often accounted for 50% of the world’s output in those decades.  The Economic and Social Research Council awarded Swansea University and its partners £95,000 to raise awareness of the rich heritage of a once famed Welsh copper industry.  This is being done through a travelling exhibition, websites, social media, 3D animations and a host of events.

[Conference speakers are then listed.]
