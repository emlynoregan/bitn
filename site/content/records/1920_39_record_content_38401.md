Tubercular Soldiers’ Aid Society Concert on 3 June in the Institute drew only a poor house for a first class program.  It was disappointing and of course donations have fallen off dramatically due to the depression.  There is an aim to lay a penny trail from Adelaide to Angorichina Hostel and Milton Tiddy volunteered to sell a £10 roll of 1d tickets.  A dance followed.
