Obituary/Inquest.  An inquest was held on Tuesday last at the Miners’ Arms on the body of William James.  Evidence showed he had been working at Kingston’s Shaft, sinking it deeper, when a piece of stuff from the surface fell and struck the deceased, killing him instantly.  The verdict was ‘Accidental death.’
