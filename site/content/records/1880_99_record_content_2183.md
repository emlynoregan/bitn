Redruth Court 10 November

Mr Bromley was fined 10/- for driving a horse on the footpath in Queen St.

Gray v. Oliver of Copperhouse.

Mrs Oliver was charged with driving on the wrong side of the road near Sara & Dunstan’s in Aberdeen.  The defendant admitted being there, but said she was calling at Sara & Dunstan’s and pulled off for that purpose.  A witness corroborated her evidence and the case was dismissed.  [Probably Johanna Oliver, widow of William Oliver.]
