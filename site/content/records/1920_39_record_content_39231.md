Obituary.  Stewart Russell Oborn entered Burra Hospital on Monday for an operation on Tuesday, but on Monday evening he suffered a heart attack and died immediately.  He was 49.  He was the popular headmaster of Burra State School and had visited each class before leaving on Monday.  His thoughtfulness for the children under his care has been a feature of his work, especially since the depression started.  Before rations were distributed as they are now he arranged for soup and cocoa and cake to be served daily in his office to children who were unable to get nutritious meals at home and since then he has worked in the direction of warm wearing apparel.  He was honorary secretary of the Burra Unemployment Relief Fund.  He has been most tactful and kind and has judiciously aided many who had not sought relief.  In the school he has improved visual aids and equipment and in the town was a strong member of the Bowling Club and a member and officer of St Maryâ€™s Church.  He was a member of the AO Foresters Lodge and of the Kooringa Masonic Lodge.  Sympathy is extended to his wife and young sons and daughter.
