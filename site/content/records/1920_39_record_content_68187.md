T.P. Halls writes to explain why he and Alec Bevan can park in front of the Burra Station.  Firstly Bevan is the mail contractor.  Secondly they both pay for the privilege:

£1-5-0 per year for stand and platform tickets

£3-5-0 per year to the Town Council to run a bus on the road

10/- per year to the Registrar of Motor Vehicles for a driver’s licence

5/- per year to the Town Council for a driver’s licence

[Though judging from his letter this 5/- was included in the £3-5-0 above.]
