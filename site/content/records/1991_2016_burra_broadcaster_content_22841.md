Don & Miriam Griffen and their children Amelia and Edward have relocated to Blanchetown after a long association with Mt Bryan & the Burra District.  Paddy Griffen arrived in Mt Bryan after his mother married Billy Dare of Mt Bryan East.  Paddy married Mildred Simmons, a local girl and moved to Pt Adelaide where he worked for a wharf-building firm.  After WWI his brother, Martin, was granted a soldier’s block at Mt Bryan.  Paddy inherited this block after Martin’s untimely death in 1930.  He moved in with his wife and family: Howard (13) and Kathleen (9).  Howard was Dux of the School in Year 7.  He worked on the farm until going to WWII, where he rose to the rank of Lieutenant.  He spent most of his service in the Middle East as a radio operator with the 9th Division Cavalry.  He was recalled home to train troops at Canungra in Queensland.   During his time away he began corresponding with Sylvie Lloyd, a Leighton girl who was secretary of the Fighting Forces Comfort Fund, and they married in 1944.

After the war Sylvie and Howard were both very involved with the community.  Sylvie was active in the CWA, the Mt Bryan School Welfare Club, The Methodist Church Ladies’ Guild, the Burra Show Society, Meals on Wheels, Red Cross and later the Burra Bowling Club among other things.  Howard was a member of the Mt Bryan Agricultural Society, the School Council, the Mt Bryan Hall Committee, the Recreation Ground Committee, the Mt Bryan Methodist Church and the Burra Show, where he was largely responsible for bringing about the erection of the Wool Pavilion.  He was also head steward for many years.  Later in life he was very involved with the RSL and the Burra Bowling Club.  His greatest service was with Legacy with which he was actively involved until he suffered a stroke in 1997.  He will also be remembered for his enthusiasm and dedication to improving Merino sheep, including inventing the first fleece weighing wool table.  He pioneered water and soil conservation and sustainable farming techniques.

Don followed in his father’s footsteps and was involved in Rural Youth, Apex, the Agricultural Bureau, Farmers’ Federation and various sporting organisations, including a long association with the Burra Volleyball Club and the multi premiership winning team ‘The Studs’.  He was also involved with the Mt Bryan school Council, the Hall Committee, ‘Jam with Ham’, Burra Tourism Assoc., Merino Capital Committee, N. Areas Advisory Council for Agriculture, the Burra Show Society and Gaining Ground in Goyder.  He was innovative in his farming techniques and sheep production.  He designed and built a shearing shed with a separate facility for artificial breeding and was used extensively in the late 1980s when Don was involved in research and development with the Dept. of Agriculture and the Collinsville Merino Stud.

Dom and Miriam were married in 1982 and Miriam was also much involved in the community; first as a teacher at Burra and then at Mt Bryan.  She has been involved with many organisations over the years including Mt Bryan-Hallett Play Group, School Council, Burra Guides, Crippled Children’s Assoc., and the Callisthenics Club and was a volunteer at the Regional Art Gallery.

Their children Amelia and Edward have also been involved in the community as members of the BBH Netball and Football Clubs and the Mt Bryan Tennis Club.  Amelia was active in the Guides for five years and in callisthenics.  A presentation was made of an engraved tray.
