J.C. of Clare on 2 May writes on the state of the Country.

I was through the Bundaleer Run a few days ago and believe I could carry all the grass away in a bag on my back.  Drought and fires have made a wreck of the run.  The day I was there 20,000 sheep were turned adrift on the run and the overseer said that unless rain fell soon not one lamb in 100 would live.  Mr Jas. Nankervis said at Balailey [sic: Belalie?] mail station adjoining the run, they had lost 16 horses for want of grass in eight months, though they had six miles of country.  I saw several penniless migrants seeking work.  It is a pitiful sight to see the natives on this run.  They are in great distress.  Where now are their hunting grounds or their game?  Mr Hill the overseer says that many times he has given them tea, flour and sugar, though they are not employed.  When in Adelaide he applied for assistance from the Protector of Aborigines, but was told he (the Protector) had no power to assist.  The overseer said that in six years all that had been supplied by the Government for the natives had been 1 ton of flour, 2 bags of sugar and half a chest of tea.  ‘Perhaps those good people in Adelaide willing to subscribe for the conversion of the blacks could first see that they did not die of starvation.’
