Knocking Down Cheques at Burra

A correspondent recently reported from a third un-named party that at Burra now many shearers were being encouraged by publicans to ‘knock down their cheques’, resulting in many disgraceful scenes.  After making careful enquiry we are satisfied that this report is much exaggerated.  Several hundred shearers have passed through the town on their return from the stations, but there has been much less drunkenness than this time last year.  This is attributed to the vigilance of the trooper on duty, who, we are assured, exerts himself energetically to suppress the malpractices which are unhappily so common.
