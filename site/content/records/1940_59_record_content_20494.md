Fire.  A fire on Mrs C.A. Drew’s property at Leighton on Thursday destroyed sheds, farm implements, six bales of wool and 300 bags of seed wheat.  It appears that the fire started from a battery recharging plant.  Despite the efforts of about 30 neighbours and friends, the fire was too hot for them to do much to extinguish it, although they did manage to save a combine, a truck, tractor and a motor car.  Drums of power kerosene close to the flames posed a further danger and they did ultimately explode.  Fortunately the wind was blowing the heat away from the homestead.  Losses included a shearing plant, two headers, a buckboard, a Buick car, an oil engine, a buggy and many tools.
