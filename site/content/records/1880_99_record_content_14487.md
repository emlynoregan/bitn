Editorial on the scurvy way in which the Council treated the Mayor’s request for some trees.  The permanent benefit to the town was surely worth a brief debt of perhaps £2-£3 for each ward.

2nd Leader.  The Aberdeen Reserve should never have been considered a town reserve and the Mayor’s decision to leave it to North Ward is totally justified.  The North Ward Councillors constantly complain of the ‘white elephant’ of the Recreation Ground, but this move shows they are only complaining because it is not in North Ward.  Such petty jealousies are pitiable and unfortunate.

The Recreation Ground is almost equidistant from both ends and all parties should accept it in its proper light as a recreation ground for all for a long time to come.  We don’t wish to see the Aberdeen Reserve lost to the Public, but if it is to be secured it must be at the cost of those whose properties will be benefited by it and by the Ward, which desires its appropriation.

3rd Leader on the need for a detailed scientific investigation of SA to establish its mineral worth and potential for mining development.  In particular the proprietors of the Alma & Waukaringa Mines deserve the Government assistance they are requesting.

The YMPA has sold its Aberdeen properties by auction in Adelaide yesterday to the English, Scottish and Australian Chartered Bank.
