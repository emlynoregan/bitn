Fire.  A fire at the Burra Hotel in the Saloon bar on Friday night did about £300-£400 damage.  It was noticed by joint proprietor Mr D. Sleader at about10.50 p.m. and his partner Mr K. Flaherty rang the alarm at the Fire Station and returned with a fire extinguisher.  Firemen Spackman, Williams and Barry followed with another. Mr Sleader had largely extinguished the fire when they arrived and finished the job.  The cause has not been identified.
