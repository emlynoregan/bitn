Editorial on the Corporation.  The Town Council had now been in operation for 11½ years and each year had seen an advance.  After some early scandalous waste of money the income has on the whole been well spent and not just in a few favoured localities.  We have a bonded debt, but for every £ borrowed £2 has been spent and with the ceasing of Government subsidy it is now seen that this was the right thing to do at the right time.  The only disputes this year had been a minor one over Jubilee Avenue and the Waterworks.  In the Jubilee Avenue there are four rows totalling 800 trees and only a few trees in the second row are in dispute. [About being on unconsolidated ground.]  These trees, taking into account all associated works cost about 4/7 each to plant, which is less than half the cost of those in streets with tree guards.  We see no reason to worry about future costs - they will need only a little water as those in other streets get and for that there is enough money.
