The Australian Carob Co. recently won an Advantage SA Yorke and Mid North Regional Awards Glass Pear Trophy, awarded at a presentation evening at Moonta last week.  It won in the Department for Manufacturing, Innovation, Trade, Resources and Energy Innovation.  The owner-manager is Michael Jolly.  The company has been in operation for 12 years and has grown to be the largest Carob orchard in Australia with 6,000 producing trees.  In 2010-11 the company installed the only fully integrated commercial processing plant in Australia, consisting of a carob kibbler*, a large roasting oven and a large milling plant.  They are currently installing packaging machinery.   [A kibbler is a grinding machine.]
