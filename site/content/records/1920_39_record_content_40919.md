Frank Earle of Mullaby had a narrow escape from serious injury last week.  He was holding wires down on a fence for his horse to get through when a barb pricked the horseâ€™s leg and it lashed out.  Earle was dragged some 60 yards by the reins and down a creek bank where the animal freed itself.  Mr T. Warnes who was camped with sheep nearby came to the rescue and later in Burra Dr Steven attended to his injuries, mainly painful lacerations to leg and thigh and a broken nose.
