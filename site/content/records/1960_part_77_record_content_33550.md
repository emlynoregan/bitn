Burra Primary School Welfare Club

The activities of 1966 are reported by Mrs J. Carpenter.  [In just over 1 column of detail.]

There were 62 financial members.  Some major activities included financing the installation of a backdrop for the tennis court (subsidised by the Education department).  They assisted at the schoolâ€™s sports day in April when stalls raised $177.25.  There was some difficulty in getting the subsidy paid by the Education Department on the funds raised for library books, but after Mr Ron Moreland personally met with the Director of Education Mr Mander Jones, the problems were resolved.  Mr Mander Jones visited the school to officially open the painted and furnished library on 28 October.
