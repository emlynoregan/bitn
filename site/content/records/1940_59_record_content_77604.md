Burra Swimming Pool progress report.  The base has been levelled to depth and the floor covered with a six inch layer of sand.  The necessary cement, fabric and non-prite mixture have been delivered.  Forming boards are on site.  A three inch water inlet has been connected and all seems ready for concreting to begin.  Money is urgently needed so send contributions care of B.E. Gryst at the Savings Bank, Burra.
