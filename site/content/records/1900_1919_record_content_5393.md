Redruth Methodist Circuit quarterly meeting.  Report that the income had met expenditure and the deficiency and also that Â£95 had been raised towards renovating the manse, fencing the circuit paddock and paying arrears of interest on the Primitive Methodist Church.  The meeting sanctioned the enlargement of the Primitive Methodist Church which will in future be known as Jubilee Hall.  Gratitude was expressed for the improved health of the pastor, Rev. W.F. James on his return from his change and rest.

Methodist Jubilee Hall Redruth.

The old Primitive Methodist Church is unsafe and too small, so the trustees of the Redruth Methodist Church have agreed to take it over, repair it, and extend it by ten feet.  Tenders were called last week and on Monday the tender of Launder, Griffiths & Pearce was accepted.
