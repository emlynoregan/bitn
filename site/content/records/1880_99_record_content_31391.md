Burra Waterworks.  A letter has been sent by Council to the Commissioner of Public Works objecting to his recommendation to Cabinet that the Council pay interest on a capital cost far in excess of the works’ true value and including a sum for the erection of a scheme solely used by the Railways Department and since removed, and other works substituted for it, and which have also been charged.

The Council feel that in the face of the rate imposed they have no option but to lease the works again to protect themselves even at an excessive rent and therefore desire to enter into a lease on your terms from 1 Jan. 1889 on the conditions included in the old lease and the delegation to them of the Government’s rating powers.  Also that should the water supply fail due to the working of the Burra Mine the Government shall be obliged to provide a new supply and the cost of the new supply to be debited to the capital account in substitution for the cost of the superseded works and that no interest be payable while the supply is unavailable.
