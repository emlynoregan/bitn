Burra National Trust will replace the main beams of the landings at Morphett’s Enginehouse.  The timbers have been rotting since restoration in the mid-1980s.  Engineer Richard Atkinson is looking for suitable timbers from Queenstown in Tasmania and if this proves unsuccessful a composite timber may have to be used.
