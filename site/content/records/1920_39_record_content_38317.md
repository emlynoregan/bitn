J.R. Oborn headmaster of the Primary School thanks the Council for the new footpath to the school.

Maurice Bednall Solicitor advises that if reserves were not marked as such on original plans they were the property of the person cutting up the land.

As to a small reserve near Mr T. Turner’s, it had been so long in his possession that he was entitled to ownership, the Corporation having no title.

The Corporation had sold parts of East St and Victoria Parade.

The transfer of land near the school from Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. to the town was signed.

The balance of the land is to be fenced and the Council will pay half the cost of the boundary fence.  No buildings are to be erected on the land.

The Town Clerk said the Council overdraft was now between £900 & £1,000; the largest ever.
