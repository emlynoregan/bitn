Mt Barker Boys’ Visit passed off very successfully.  They were billeted out and performed at the Institute before a large audience.  They also visited the Burra Hospital, the Burra State School and High School and had afternoon tea at the Reformatory with Miss Bubb.  They were in the charge of Major John Ward, an old Burra boy.  They were a selection from 87 in the house at Mt Barker.  The boys earned a profit of £30, which goes towards running the home.
