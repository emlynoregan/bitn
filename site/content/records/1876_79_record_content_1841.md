Burra Hospital opening & laying of school foundation stone

30 subscribers met in No. I ward for final report of Building Committee before it gave way to Management Committee.

Mr Goss had completed his contract for painting the hospital. Hospital was insured for £3,000.

Absence of Sir George Kingston in other colonies has delayed transfer of hospital from SAMA to the Burra Corporation as an estate in fee simple.

Report of temporary Hospital Management Committee.

Mr & Mrs Wright Heath appointed wardsman and matron at £100 p.a. + apartment + rations.

Recommendation that hospital come under the Hospital Act of 1867 [as a public hospital]

Expenditure to date £1853/0/11 and receipts £1872/3/5 including a promissory note for £550. Leaving a balance of +£19/2/6

Assets exceed liabilities by £743/l/7

Sir Henry Ayers and official party left Adelaide at l0am by special train, arriving Burra c.1.40pm. Met by Mayor, P. Lane & Crs Lipsett, Sanders & others. Shown over hospital and then opening took place in the lobby. Ayers introduced by the architect William Beattie. An unremarkable speech was followed by lunch in what had been the old Burra Hotel Assembly Room. (Provided by the Commercial Hotel)

After lunch all went to the Institute to form a procession led by Burra Brass Band, then 20 Freemasons & The Oddfellows, Foresters, & Rechabites; all in full regalia. Then came Ayers and members of the ministry, the Mayor and members of the Corporation and Mr Bath. (c. 160 Friendly Society members in all.)

Burra School: About 1,500 gathered at the school - it being a half holiday for businesses in the town. To the north and east of the building site were some 900 children from the various Sabbath Schools. The stone was laid by Thomas Bath as the earliest established businessman in Burra. The school was intended for 800-900 children and should be completed by the end of 1877 at a cost of £6976 [by Sara & Dunstan]

Dinner was held at the old Assembly Room in the hospital. Ayers made a highly partisan political speech full of self congratulation and was countered by an equally contentious political attack from Mr Rowland Rees M.P.

A concert in the Institute completed the evening's celebrations.
