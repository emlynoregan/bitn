Sparks Column.

Thomas Reed, the new Mayor of Clare, was born in Burra.

It is probable that a woodcartersâ€™ union will be formed in Burra shortly.

James Thyer, the father of Joseph Thyer, who murdered his wife and five children, died in the Asylum last week.

Two girls, Emma Boswel and Louie Weismeyer, aged 16 & 17 respectively, cleared from the Reformatory on Thursday evening.
