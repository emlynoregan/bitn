Mongolata Goldfield

There have been some good finds recently on Byles’ Mongolata No. 8 and good stuff too on Salter & Hogan’s Claim in their new drive.

Charles Greenwood reports on Byles’ Lease.

Located 16 miles northeast of Burra on the eastern scarp of a range of largely sandstone formation, the outcrop can be traced for nearly three miles and is being prospected and worked for that distance.  The sandstone contains quartz and ironstone veins which are like auriferous dykes.  The claim is of 27 acres of which 17 are on lode and 10 acres north are a machine site.  An open cut is put across part of the lode from which a drive has been extended 90ft on a slight southerly dip and along this the reef is exposed from 3-5ft thick.  Crushings give an average 5oz to the ton.  A shaft has been sunk cutting the reef at 22ft.  Total depth of shaft is 53ft with a crosscut 14ft east.  Samples from the face gave poor results.  Along the main drive from the open cut the reef is showing 4ft wide quartz and manganiferous ironstone with lenses of rich ore.  Distribution of the gold content is peculiar passing from rich to poor in a few feet.  At 114ft the winze is down 17ft on the underlay, 10ft vertical a drive is going south 26ft.  There is a full face of quartz and ironstone, but it is not payable.  On the north side of the winze a fine make of stone goes down underfoot, good values from samples with no visible gold.  Good stone in the east of the drive dips east.  On the west a rise is up a few feet and in the drive off the west the reef shows 3ft quartz and ironstone.  Samples give ½oz per ton.

A second open cut is put across the lode in the gully below and 80ft north of the ore dump.  Insufficient work has been done to prove this place, but a trial produced 5½0z per ton.

The mine can easily be worked by open cuts and an adit driven from the east side of the hill.  Shaft working must come later.  In my opinion there is about 5,000 tons of crushing ore in sight of payable kind to justify the erection of a ten head stamp battery as soon as water can be supplied.  About 250 tons of payable ore are stacked on the mine.
