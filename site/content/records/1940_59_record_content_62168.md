Fire & Floods have occurred in the last week or so.  While lightning caused the 2,000-acre fire at Ulooloo on 16 January, the same clouds dropped heavy rain in the Franklin and Pandappa district, 10 miles away.  Short, local floodwaters flowed as far as Mallett Station.

Yesterday 140 points fell at George Hagger’s between Hallett & Jamestown, while three miles away lightning caused a 20-acre fire.

Yesterday evening continuous lightning could be seen to the east of Burra – apparently from a cloud bank, now known to have been over Hogback Station, which received 162 points of rain in an hour.  Floodwaters filled the Kia-Ora house dam and reached the lagoon.  For the week Hogback has recorded over 230 points.  Koomooloo received 63 points from the same storm and the house dam overflowed.  Woolgangi filled three dams from a fall of 30 points and Glenora recorded 46 points.
