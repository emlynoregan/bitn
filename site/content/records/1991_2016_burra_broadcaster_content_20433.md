Goyder Veterinary Services held an open day and invited the public to inspect its premises, prior to opening for business this week.  Many brought their pet for a tour and resident vet Jane Parker had bookings well into the week.  The clinic is located in Queen Street on the former site of the Burra Kindergarten.  Jane will be assisted by veterinary nurses Jan Tiver and Ruth Strachan.  After hours emergency calls are to be shared with Dr Jack Coffey.  [Photo of Jane Parker, Jan Tiver & Ruth Strachan.]
