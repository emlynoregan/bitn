Mr J. Rumball was relieved of his duties as stationmaster on Monday 3 July.

‘It is a week or two since the Commissioners wrote Mr Rumball requesting him to send in his resignation with a view of taking eight months leave of absence which he is entitled to under the regulations of the South Australian Railways.  There has as yet been no reply to the requisition from a large number of townspeople that Mr Rumball keep his position.  Mr Keitch will take his place, but no one can permanently be appointed till Mr Rumball’s leave of absence expires, and whether he will continue in service remains to be seen.’
