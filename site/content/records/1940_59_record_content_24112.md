Obituary.  Mr Walter Pearce died at the Burra Hospital on Friday.  He was born at Mintaro in 1862, the son of the late Mr & Mrs Henry Pearce, who resided in Mt Bryan for many years.  He left school at an early age and worked on farms owned by his father at Mt Bryan and Baldina.  Later, before the railway reached there, he and his brother Fred accepted contracts to convey good to Broken Hill.  Later he went share farming and dam-sinking, but eventually sold his plant.  He was then employed for about 30 years by Drew & Crewes and retired many years ago, to reside in Burra.  In 1887 he married Ann, the eldest daughter of the late Mr & Mrs John Rogers of Baldina, who survives him.  There were six daughter and five sons, of whom six daughters and one son survive: Ella (Mrs Bown of Burra), Edie (Mrs Neate of Adelaide), Laura (Mrs Duffty of NSW), Miriam (Mrs Davey of Adelaide), Vera (Mrs Dolling of Pt Broughton), Miss Edna Pearce (of Burra) and Mr Hedley Pearce (of Burra).  [Born 31 July 1862, Mintaro; died 3 November 1945, Burra.]
