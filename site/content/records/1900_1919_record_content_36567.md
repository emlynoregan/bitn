‘The Dandies’ performed to a very good house last Thursday.  The first half of the program of songs, sketches and humour was praised, but the second half was dominated by a farce, which lowered the tone and spoilt the evening.  The company commented on the entire lack of the larrikin element at the back of the hall – something they had found a problem in many other places.
