Cr Jennison felt keenly the unkind remarks of the Mayor.  He however, intended to stick to his policy of fair play.  He was not being backed by the RSL and even if he were this was no different to the Mayor being backed by his admirers.  Mr Dow was certainly helping him, but otherwise the League was not involved.  The Mayor’s remarks suggest that but for him the town and Mongolata would have been neglected.  All members of the Council had worked hard and were entitled to share credit with the Mayor.  He was not responsible for the letter in the paper two weeks earlier, while ‘Ratepayer’ the following week was no doubt by one of his admirers.  He had every regard for Mongolata and had been among the first to invest in it.  He congratulated the Mayor on the latter’s work to find relief for the men out there and he and other Councillors had assisted the Mayor in that.  As for the money from The News.  It had gone directly to the Mayor and been distributed without consultation with the Council, so how could the Mayor expect Council to write thanks for a matter they had nothing to do with officially.  If anyone deserved credit for the restoration and erection of ‘Johnny Green’ it was Cr March, but he like other Councillors saw no need for a special function to mark the event.  He was flattered to accept the request to stand and his decision was in part influenced by the Government’s move to change the way that Mayors would be elected.  As a Councillor he had done his work without fear or favour.  As a member of the Finance Committee he could speak with authority on the financial difficulties of the Council.  The Council had not let slip any chance of securing relief funds as a result of untiring efforts by all members of Council and the capable assistance of the Town Clerk.  As for Mongolata, though it was not in the Council’s territory, the Council had done many things for it and the Mayor had taken all the credit and not given sufficient where due to other Councillors.  He could not foresee any relief for ratepayers given demands on the Council and much of what had been achieved was due to extra relief monies obtained.  There was so far no sign the Government would make Christmas relief funds available this year.  The Mayor’s casting vote had turned down a scheme that would have given many of the unemployed some relief for Christmas and the Mayor had so far not presented another workable scheme for consideration – a fact he regretted.
