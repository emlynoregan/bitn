The Burra Review – Dinner & Theatre Show was held in the RSL Hall on Thursday 13 December.  It was a wonderful success.  The cast included Mary Abbott, Sid Allen, Edith Carpenter, Teresa Dargie, Rob George, Alan Langham, Coralie Plush, Del Reed, Terry Rule, Maureen Sherlock, John Stephenson, Jan Tiver and Bill Young, who gave two musical items.  It is a bit sad to think that half the cast, being teachers, have been transferred for 1974.  The event raised $85.70 for Save the Children Fund.
