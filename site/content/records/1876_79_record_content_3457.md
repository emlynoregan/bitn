Offences. A letter to the editor points out that the Corporation inspector was good at fining people for allowing animals to stray within the town contrary to by-law, but what of the by-law forbidding storekeepers to "place, hang up, or otherwise expose for sale within the said town any goods, wares, merchandise, matter, or thing whatsoever, so that the same be or project upon, into or over any footway beyond or outside the doorway." "It would be difficult to say what is not exposed on the footpathe" [sic] by the Mayor, the Ex-Mayor, Councillors and others. Why is there one law for some and not for these?
