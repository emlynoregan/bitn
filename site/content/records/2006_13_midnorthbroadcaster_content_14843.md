The Eastern Pastoral survey of 1861-62

Although some land northeast of Burra had been taken up by pastoralists on ‘occupation leases’ before 1861, the Government got little money from such leases.  A proper survey of the land would enable more accurate boundaries and the creation of more permanent tenure.  In 1861 surveyor James Brook set out from an existing baseline and trig points in the hills northwest of Burra to complete a trigonometrical survey of the north eastern ‘waste lands’.

He surveyed north to Olary, west to near Quorn and east to the NSW border on Mutooroo Station.  After six months he completed his task in June 1862.  Locating drinkable water was a constant problem for the early surveyors.  The result of his survey was the establishment of pastoral leases, some of them over more than 1,000 square miles and carrying tens of thousands of sheep.  Using these trig points the town site locations for Yunta, Mannahill, Olary and the route to Broken Hill were also established.

In May 2012 retired Lands Department surveyor Paul Tucker decided to explore some of the original points in the Olary region, established by Brooks 150 years ago.  Just south of Olary, Brooks established a baseline.  Using a simple 100 link surveyor’s chain Brooks measured this line at 8.427 miles.  At each end of this baseline he erected a permanent stone cairn six feet across and six feet high with a central pole eleven feet eight inches high.  Though the centre poles have gone, the cairns remain.  From these trig points the Lands Department surveyor Malcolm Butler established another trig point in 1951 for the surveying of Radium Hill uranium mining reserve.  It was this point that Paul Tucker decided to find.

After many calculations and with friend Kevin Kakoschke deputising as his ‘chainman’ determined the spot where the pin marking the point should be.  With the aid of a hand held GPS position fixing device they found the pin under eight inches of dirt.  They went on to find other pegs of the Radium Hill Pioneer Cemetery and some associated with the old uranium mining reserve.  They did, however, enjoy much more comfortable conditions and much better food than the original survey party.
