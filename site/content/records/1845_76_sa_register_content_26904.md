Kooringa, 1 December.

Dr Antliff delivered his interesting lecture on temperance in the Institute Hall on Saturday to a fair audience.  He preached three sermons on Sunday.  In the afternoon and evening the attendance was so large that the lecture and entrance halls had to be thrown into one.  On Monday a tea-meeting at the Primitive Methodist Chapel was well attended.  Afterwards, at the Institute, the Revs G.W. Patchell, S. Wellington, S. Gray and T. Hillman gave the Rev. Dr Antliff a hearty welcome.  S. Olley of Riverton took the chair.  Dr Antliff gave a very amusing speech and on the next evening gave his popular lecture Happiness in Wedlock.  Captain Sanders presided.

On Sunday morning the Roman Catholic Bishop confirmed 50 young persons and celebrated mass assisted by Rev. J. Tappeiner.  His Lordship then went on to Hanson [i.e. Farrell’s Flat].

Hay harvesting is virtually finished.  Locusts are flying about in great numbers, but as yet have not damaged crops very much.  Reaping should begin in 10-14 days if the good weather continues.
