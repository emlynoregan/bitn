Easter in Burra

The Church of England Sunday School treat was held at Princess Royal.  Three wagon loads of children set out on Monday morning, along with Rev. Stanton, the choristers and friends in private traps.  They were hospitably received and enjoyed fruit from the orchard and vineyard and danced on the verandah.  They were treated to a dinner in the large dining room, to which the accompanying adults were also invited.  They enjoyed a fine cold collation.  They returned to Burra by sundown.

On Tuesday evening Rev. Stanton presented an entertainment at the Burra Hotel Assembly Room, attended by about 130.  £6-16-6 was raised for the Firewood Fund for the poor.

The Wesleyan Sunday School held its Anniversary over Easter.  Mr Bone of Kent Town presented two sermons and Rev. Pope preached in the afternoon.  On Sunday evening it is estimated one sixth of the town’s population crammed the chapel.  On Monday the children were regaled with fruit at a picnic on Limestone Hill.  Mr McCulloch supplied the fruit.  Tea meetings followed.  Proceeds totalled £30-17-6.  About 200 children are on the books, but complaints of a scarcity of teachers are made.
