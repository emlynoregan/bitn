Salvation Army Harvest Festival was led in the Barracks last Sunday.  Three services were conducted by Capt. Melksham and his wife.  Their good work since taking over has seen new members joining.  There was a grand display with a painted background 24’ x 10’ showing a harvest scene with real wheat in front with bags of wheat and loaves of bread and seasonable fruit and then a neat post and wire fence.  W.J. Davey was engaged to photograph the scene and it is being sent to Melbourne where the Army is awarding a prize of a bicycle to the officer with the best display in Australia.
