Burra Town Council, 6 December

A.J. & P.A. McBride write saying they are willing to present to Council the lot known as ‘Howell’s.

Sara & Co. advise they are installing a 16 ton weighbridge 18ft x 8ft at Aberdeen.  Permission was deferred for two months.

£1-1-0 donation was made to the Limbless Soldiers’ Assoc.

Drew & Crewes acquire lots 69, 70 & 71 New Aberdeen.

Cr Dow failed in an attempt to move to rescind the motion concerning plans and specifications for a grandstand at the oval.

The Postal Dept. is to be asked to allow the pillar-box to remain in Welsh Place.

R.H. Garrard’s tender of £17-10-0 to build the traffic sign in Market Square was accepted.

Plans and specifications for the grandstand were placed on the table and tenders for the same were called.

Agreement with the Burra Electric Supply Co. was signed and sealed.

Mrs James Reed’s house was entered while the family was at Mr John Reed’s wedding on Saturday, but nothing seems to have been taken.

Burra Rifle Club fired the 11th stage of the Mrs Cyril Collins Trophy on Saturday and the maximum 105 was scored by: C. Edwards, W.K. Pexton, R.H. Barty, A.C. Aughey & R. Bernhardt.
