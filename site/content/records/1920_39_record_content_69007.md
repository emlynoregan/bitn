Burra Water Supply

Mr Corney and a party from the Waterworks Department have been taking levels between Farrell’s Flat and Mt Bryan to determine the easiest route for the pipeline from the River Murray to the new town of Whyalla.  It will come from Morgan via ‘The Gums’, Burra, Booborowie and Spalding.  Burra’s present supply of water is plentiful, but heavily mineralised.  Burra would greatly benefit from having access to this supply of water as would pastoral holdings en route.
