Kooringa News, 6 June

St Mary’s is about to lose its pastor, the Rev. D.J.H. Ibbetson.  There is to be a vestry meeting tonight to decide his successor.

Last week the local Court of full Jurisdiction sat at Redruth and there were 32 cases listed.  The establishment of Circuit Courts would be a great boon to country districts.  Many are debarred from obtaining redress and justice from not having the means to take their case to Adelaide.

Burra Burra Mine.  The new lode is realising the most sanguine of expectations.  Doubtless this is the reason the company is taking on hands, although only recently they were discharging men.

The highways and byways in the township have rarely been in a more miserable state due to the continuing wet weather.
