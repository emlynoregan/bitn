Burra Town Council, Special Meeting 4 December.

The new Mayor, Dr Brummitt, was warmly welcomed amid protestations that efforts would be made to make Council affairs flow more smoothly in 1895.

Cr Sampson moved that Council meet on the 1st and 3rd Monday evenings in the month.  Cr West 2nd.

Cr Harris amended to Tuesday and Cr Hardy 2nd.

Cr Sampson suggested there was something behind the move, but the amendment was carried.

Resolved that the Public Works Committee comprise Crs Sampson, Harris & Hardy.

Resolved that the Finance Committee comprise Crs West, Rabbich and Parks, with Cr Parks as chairman.
