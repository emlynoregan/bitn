Letter.  Following a paragraph recently reminding people to walk on the right hand side of the road to Burra North, (facing the traffic) or to use the footpath, G.A. Heinrich writes urging Councillors to try the footpath â€“ they might then learn why people are using the road.  A good footpath should be provided.
