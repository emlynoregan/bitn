Porter’s Lagoon Sports struck wintry weather with showers and southwest wind.  Despite this attendance was very good.  There were no entrants in the ladies events, though Miss Joyce Wehrmann of Solomontown entered in the Allcomers event, but the cold caused her to succumb to cramp near the finishing line.  Boating events were better patronised.  There was a good effort from Mr M.J. Tiddy of Aberdeen in riding the sea horse and riding the greasy barrel on a greasy pole over water.  There were many entries in sheaf-tossing, throwing the weight, etc.  Six competitors tossed the sheaf over 34ft, which was the highest the bar could be set.  The honours went to J. Vandaleur of Saddleworth.  Dan Smith of Mintaro won the weight tossing.  Results of events are printed.
