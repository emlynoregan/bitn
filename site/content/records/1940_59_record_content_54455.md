The War Memorial Oval Committee met on 8 April.  Burra Football Club advised it would like to use the oval this season.  The Committee was glad it would see activity on the old ground once more.  Football had been absent from Victoria Park for five years.  They were also delighted to hear that Mr Clive Jettner had removed all the big tree butts from the oval.  They will now seek aid from the District Council to have the ground skimmed and cleaned up.  The shed will be partitioned off and water laid on for showers and they hope to provide at least some seating.
