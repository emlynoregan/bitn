Railway Accident

On Monday morning about 10 a.m. A Stodart, cab proprietor who has recently bought the business from T. Halls, was returning to Kooringa from the Bon Accord Hotel when at the Bon Accord crossing he heard a train whistle, but the west wind made him assume it was from the engine in the yard.  It was in fact from a luggage train coming from the north.  He started across the crossing and only noticed the train when it was about six yards away and blew another whistle.  He struck the horses and made a jump.  The train struck the cab on the back wheel and smashed it to atoms, carrying the tyre to the station platform.  The traces broke and the horses escaped, though one was thrown onto its back into the culvert.  Mr Stodart was winded in landing and on rising was so disoriented that he almost fell under the train, but was restrained by a bystander.  He later complained of pains in his back and side and was spitting blood and unable to stand.
