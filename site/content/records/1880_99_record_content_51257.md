Ex-Councillor Sampson presented the requisition for the meeting which took place on 20 September in the Institute when Dr Brummitt presided as a very effective chairman.

Mr Sampson said he had attended two or three meetings to see for himself whether the reports in the paper were false and he was thoroughly satisfied they were not.  He felt that when debate got heated Councillors said things they were later ashamed to see in print.  He could only term them a lot of _____.  The meeting of 12 September when such a disgraceful scene took place was reported fairly.  [The meeting where the Mayor called in the police.]  Mr Sampson alluded to Cr Hardy’s unsuccessful attempt a few months before to sue the editor for libel and when that failed ‘he allowed private spleen to still play a prominent part in carrying out the duties of his public position – ‘the offending councillors and the mayor had allowed their feeling to overcome their judgement sufficiently to make trouble’. 

‘The Council meetings and councillors were never more grossly represented than when Cr Hardy used to write the reports. (Laughter)’

Mr Sampson then moved, ‘That this meeting hereby expresses its dissatisfaction at the conduct of the Mayor, and Councillors Parks, Hardy and Harris in conducting the business of the Town Council by excluding ratepayers from the general meeting of same.’

The more he considered matters the more serious it became.

‘On 12 September at a sort of adjourned meeting the assessment of the town was ordered and he would ask the Councillors to retrace their steps and put the town in proper working order.  (Cheers)’

Cr Walsh 2nd and expressed dissatisfaction with the way the standing committees were ignored as well as his intention to resign if closed meetings were continued.

The Mayor rose and said he thought Ex-Councillor Sampson’s remarks were uncalled for.  ‘He said the councillors were a lot of consummate fools.’

Mr Sampson denied that and Dr Brummitt supported him.  The mayor withdrew ‘consummate’.  He thought Mr Sampson could not know if reports were true by attending two meetings.  (Sampson interjected to say three.)  Amid considerable interjection the Mayor tried to defend his record.

‘He was jealous of maintaining the dignity of the town.’

Cries of ‘Oh, oh.’  He felt that Mr Sampson would have been the first to have come down on the editor.  (The Mayor kept referring to Mr Sampson as Councillor and was corrected several times so that eventually Sampson interjected: ‘Not Councillor Sampson, please; I do not wish to be mixed up with you lot.’ And later: ‘I am not so thin skinned as you are.’

Eventually Mayor Rabbich moved as an amendment ‘That a committee of five ex-Mayors be appointed to investigate the matter, and to compare the reports as published in the Burra Record with the minute book of the Burra Corporation.’
