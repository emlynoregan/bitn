Burra Waterworks.  The questions put to the Government were:

When and by whom was the inspection made?

Has the special inspection and report promised by the Commissioner to the deputation been made?

The reply received was:

An inspection was made by the Conservator of Water on 24 August 1899.

Since this inspection in 1899 was so recent it was not deemed necessary to have a further special inspection.

No further concession can be made beyond the reduction of interest already granted of 5% to 4%.

The Government is quite willing to take over the Burra Waterworks.
