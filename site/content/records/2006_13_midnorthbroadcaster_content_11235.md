John Barton, Burra Chemist for more than 30 years, has decided to retire.  John bought the business from Murray Odgers, who had been chemist in the town for 32 years.  John arrived in Burra with his family on 1 August 1977 with his wife Von and three young children.  They also opened the adjacent shop as Open House Gift Shop.  When he arrived the local doctor was Les Miller and over the years he has seen Rob Oswald, Ashley Thomas, Peter Davies and Tim Simpson come and go.  Sadly Yvonne died several years ago and John will now buy a house in Adelaide and catch up with friends and family there.  John attributed much of the smooth running of the business to his staff, who he says have been tremendous over the years.  He is confidant that the business will evolve under his successor Tim Siv of Clare.
