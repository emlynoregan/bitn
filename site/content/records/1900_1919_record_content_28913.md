A Public Meeting at the Institute on Friday, chaired by Thomas McWaters, was largely attended to protest the new Land Tax assessment.  In some cases the assessment was up by nearly 50%.  Inferior country had risen along with the rest and sometimes had been assessed higher than good land.  A motion was passed that all should appeal individually and John McLaren and Thomas McWaters were appointed delegates to attend a deputation to the Commissioner of Taxes this week.
