Kooringa News, 29 August

The extension of the Northern Railway has been much discussed here of late among business people.  There are many thousands of tons of ore now useless because of the high cost of carriage to markets.  The produce from the northeast country would also utilise a railway from Burra.  A public meeting will be held and out Parliamentary representatives will be requested to take action in the matter.

A railway would also open country around Booborowie, Canowie and Mt Bryan to the agriculturalist.
