Phoenix Copper, the mineral exploration company, has extended until 18 January the closing date for their initial public share offer.  They announced in December 2007 plans to recommence exploration around Burra.  If they successfully sell 30 million shares at 20c each they will raise $6 million to fund the exploration.
