Editorial on Mining.  The depression of trade has the effect of driving people to new ventures and with copper now at Â£68-17-6 a ton it should spark interest in the Burra Mine.  The depression has been more severe for the last seven years than ever before.  Want of capital prevents developments in SA that would take place in Victoria or other states where the Governments also help more.
