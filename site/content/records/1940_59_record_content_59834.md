Superphosphate Troubles.  Following the trouble already reported about lumpy superphosphate, some farmers have also found a considerable amount of unwelcome debris in the super: bits of iron, nuts, bolts and nails.  Not only can these damage machinery, but an added cost is the delay caused in sowing can lead to loss of crop in the long run.
