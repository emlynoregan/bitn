Advt.  Kooringa Methodist Church calls a meeting of members, adherents and friends in the church on 22 April to consider the New Church Scheme with an estimated cost of Â£3,000.

An article adds that the plans and draft specifications have been prepared by Cowell & Cowell, architects of Adelaide.  Expert opinion is that it is not possible to repair the present structure with any advantage.
