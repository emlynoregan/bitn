Editorial.  Burra Creek to be Subdivided.

The last of the properties owned by SAMA will be sold on Thursday and the plans show the Burra Creek in allotments.  It is too late to bewail the short-sightedness of the Government or the supineness of the Corporation, but it is not too late for some local wealthy citizens to buy the land and hand it over to the Corporation on being repaid the purchase money.  Allotments along the frontage have already been sold and in a few years it will be impossible without enormous expense to gain control of the creek.  Only the Corporation should own the creek through Burra.
