Fire.  The two young children of Mr R.D. Pascoe, Vera (3) and Joseph (1½), had a lucky escape when a candle apparently set fire to clothing in their bedroom.  The fire was noticed just in time to save them and to be extinguished before spreading.  Part of the floor and most of Mr Pascoe’s clothing along with that of the four children was destroyed.  The damage is estimated at £12-£13.
