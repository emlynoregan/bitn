Principal R. Henderson is leaving Burra after five years, to become Principal of Oakbank Area School.  He said one of the most rewarding things while at Burra had been seeing almost 100% of school-leavers find jobs.  Retention rates at the school had been improved; a change he attributed to a more flexible course structure.  One of his aims had been to provide ‘more access to a wider range of interest’ in the community.  A vertically-structured class system in the secondary school theoretically allows students from any year level to study together provided they were of common academic abilities.  This has made Burra an example for other community based schools to follow in SA and interstate.  The responsibility for choosing courses has been placed on students themselves rather than on teachers and parents.  This he felt had been a factor in placing so many students in jobs.  A unified sense of community, which focused on the school, was one of the first things Mr Henderson had noticed about living in Burra.
