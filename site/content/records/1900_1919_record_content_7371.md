Burra Waterworks.

For some time a breakdown of the pump has been feared.  On Monday the engine failed, and though attempts were made to keep going using three of the six pumps it eventually had to be given up.  The engine is not powerful enough at 6 h.p. when some 14 h.p. is needed.  The cost of keeping it in repair is enormous.  About 12 months ago the Council paid £150 for repairs to the boiler and engine and now another expense is incurred.  The Waterworks account is already overdrawn £64 and as there is no way to increase income the rate will have to be raised.  It costs the Council more to pump water than they can get for it.  Repeated calls on the Government to reduce the capital account have had little effect.  We pay much more for water than anyone else in the state and constant expense to keep the old boiler in repair is sufficient reason for the Government to listen to reasonable requests.  It is absurd to assert that the value of the plant has not depreciated and in any event the original capital was far too high by some £2,000 to £3,000 and the rate of interest is exorbitant.  The Government must get the works into a good state of repair and put the financial side on a more satisfactory basis.  A few years ago there were wells in the town and a few days stoppage was not noticed, but now wells have been filled in and residents depend solely upon the supply.  Residents are perplexed to find water which will have to be carted to the Hospital and Reformatory and stock must be driven some distance.  Council at its meeting on Monday decided to take the engine out and send it to Adelaide for temporary repairs and get it back as soon as possible.  We must get a new engine.
