The Resident Magistrate’s Court

[This article complains about the injustice arising from the rules of the court.  A Burra Burra man whose wife is living in Adelaide is deemed to have been served with a summons if it is left at her house and judgement might be taken by default, even though he actually knew nothing about the matter.  Neither do the rules allow the wife to attend for him.  The legal solution is expensive involving the use of a barrister (at a guinea) to file an affidavit and to get permission for the summons to be sent to Burra Burra (on the payment of the day’s cost) with time granted to allow him to come to Adelaide, which involves the loss of a weeks wages: perhaps all for being sued for a debt, which the law and justice then declare him not to owe.  This clearly relates to actual instances of 23 December in Breaker v. Morris and Regan v. Ovens.  The Magistrate on appropriate application granted three weeks for entering the appearance, but was blithely unconcerned about the costs inflicted by the process.]
