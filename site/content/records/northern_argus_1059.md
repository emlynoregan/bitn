Ken Field’s art exhibition was opened at Polly’s Tearooms on 4 April.  The building was formerly the Burra Record Office and has been set out now as tea rooms and an art and craft gallery by Hank & Anna Bernhard to provide lunches and afternoon teas daily, except Mondays and Tuesdays and provides evening meals (BYO) on Friday & Saturday.  As well as Ken Field’s painting there is a display of pottery and Anna Bernhard’s antique dolls.
