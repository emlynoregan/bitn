Booborowie P.O. has at last been moved from a mile out of town to a position next to Bacon’s store.  It was opened 2 May with Mr S. Ringberg as Post Master.  A new 50 line switchboard has been installed.  The P.O. was previously at the premises of the late Mr Edward Wall and was taken over by Mr R. Morris, his son-in-law, c.10 years ago.  T. Woollacott of Aberdeen built the new P.O.
