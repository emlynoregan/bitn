Old Reports show that there were no extensive operations below the 300’ level.  In 1901 it was considered there were tailings and other material on the surface estimated at between 170,000 and 440,000 tons that would yield between 0.86 and 2.72% copper which might give a profit of from 2/- to 3/- per ton and some of 4/- to 5/- per ton.  They did not propose to carry on where the old mine left off, but to treat the tailing etc. and to prospect likely places where indications were favourable.

Every visitor to Burra notes with interest the open cut.  About 1,000’ south is Morphett’s Shaft which was connected with Waterhouse’s and Peacock’s Shafts at the 300’ and 360’ levels by drives and crosscuts and with Waterhouse’s at 420’.  Drives were also put in at 510’ and were in sulphide for considerable distances.  Sulphide was also found at 600’ at the bottom of Morphett’s Shaft as reported in the final report to the directors of SAMA by Captain Sanders on 11 October 1877, shortly before it was shut down.  He reported that Morphett’s Shaft had been completed to 100 fathoms, the last 10 feet on part of Kingston’s Lode of soft quartz, carbonate of lime and fluorspar, and patches of very rich purple yellow and flesh-coloured ore and scales of asbestos.

A bore pit several years ago confirmed this lode at 600’ and that it was continuous in strike and exists at 800’.  At the time the Government Geologist, H.Y.L. Brown thought it justified putting Morphett’s Shaft in order and restarting mining operations from that point.

Magnetic treatment of the tailings was tried by representatives of Elder, Smith & Co. and F.H. Snow, but was unsuccessful.  An option was let to the Great Fingall Consolidated, but the bursting of the 1907-08 copper boom put an end to their interest, they paid a substantial sum for release from their obligations.  Since then little or no work has been done.
