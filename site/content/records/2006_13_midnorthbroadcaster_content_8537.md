Football.  Football fever gripped the town with the BBH Rams having a chance to win their first premiership.  Supporters are encouraged to attend the last training session on Thursday.  A bus will take supporters to and from Riverton, leaving at 11 a.m. at a cost of $15 per person.  A function will be held after the match at the complex, with a barbecue tea and drinks available.

The NEFL Medal count was held at Brinkworth Town Hall on Monday 14 September and Rams players filled three of the top five places, though the winner was Ryan Darling of Blyth-Snowtown.

Aaron Spicer was runner-up with Peter Mann and Andrew Purchase coming fourth and fifth.  Aaron Spicer was also named Ruckman in the NEFL’s team of the year and came runner-up in the ‘Mail’ Medal count.
