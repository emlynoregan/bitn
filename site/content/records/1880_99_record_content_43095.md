Waterworks.

The existing lease expires on 31 December and negotiations have begun for a renewal under more favourable terms.  The works, having been in use for several years and the meters needing repair and maintenance, the Council thinks in common fairness the capital account, now Â£7,658, should be reduced. [To reflect the lower value of the assets being leased.]  A duplication of certain important portions of the plant etc. is necessary to prevent a failure of the water supply in the event of breakages etc.

An extra boiler and spare set of pumps and driving gear should be at the works.  The waterworks assessment has been reduced, but still presses heavily on some ratepayers.
