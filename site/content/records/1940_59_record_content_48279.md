The Burra Mine

In answer to a question by G.S .Hawker MP, the Director of Mines has given an unfavourable reply concerning the re-opening of Burra Mine.  Wallaroo and Moonta Mines are better qualified and would be re-opened first.  Detailed geological surveys of the Burra Mine in recent years suggest the prospects of finding new deposits are not as good as at Moonta or Wallaroo.  Exploratory work is not considered worthwhile.  When an opportunity permits, a geological survey of some adjacent areas will be done, where rock exposures are masked by thick soil and alluvial deposits.  If warranted test boring will be undertaken.
