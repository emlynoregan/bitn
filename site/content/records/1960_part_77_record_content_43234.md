Burra Swimming Pool

An appeal using over 200 notices to get fathers to enter a roster system to assist in management and discipline at the pool on weekends and to attend to cleaning of the dressing rooms has failed to elicit sufficient replies.  They were only 16 responses.  [And what those replies said is garbled in the report.]  The committee is faced with the expense of employing help â€“ perhaps people not prepared or able to offer direct help could offer financial assistance.
