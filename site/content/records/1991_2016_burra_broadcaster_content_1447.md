Variety Club Bash

Richard Dollman, Andrew Nourse, Alan Jacka & Craig Wissell will head off with about 50 other pre-1966 vehicles on the 3,000 km Variety Club Bash on 14 August.  It will take eight days and finish at Clare Racecourse with a dinner spectacular featuring the Delltones.  (Tickets for this event are available.)  Thanks go to Elders Merchandise of Burra for donating $2,000 towards Burra’s entry, Car 144.  [Photo of ‘the boys’.]
