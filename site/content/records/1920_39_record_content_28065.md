Burra Town Council, 17 September

Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. wrote that they had bought the blocks opposite the railway station from the estate of T.F. Robertson [presumably allotments 124-135] and sought the closed road between the blocks to consolidate their land.  Council agreed to sell it at £16-10-0 per acre.

F. Pearce applied for permission to erect a garage for Wright’s Motors Ltd at the corner of Kingston & Thames Streets.  The Mayor wanted to delay approval until Council had inspected with the possibility of resuming a few feet to widen the road and improve visibility down Thames St.

Cr Pearce agreed.  The land on which Mr L. Day’s property stood jutted out 10ft beyond the line of Commercial St.  Mr Wright said that 10ft was more value that the rest of the block because it brought the garage into view down Commercial St, otherwise it would be hidden from the view of people coming from the direction of the hospital or from the Institute.

The Mayor said that the narrowness of the bridge and the increased visibility given by the proposal meant he could not urge resumption.

Cr Pearce said he had spoken to Mr Wright who would not proceed with the development if the 10ft were resumed.  An amendment to inspect the sight was passed on the Mayor’s casting vote and after inspection it was decided to approve the erection.

T. Woollacott & Sons were granted permission to build a house for W. Montgomery in Graham.

Ayers St is to be graded, scarified and metalled.
