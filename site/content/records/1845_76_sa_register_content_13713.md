Kooringa Institute

The AGM of the Kooringa Institute was held on 23 September.  Rev. Ibbetson was called to the chair and the secretary read the 3rd annual report.  There has been a steady increase in membership and this has been chiefly from the class of persons for whom the Institute was intended.  Unfortunately the Government has seen fit to cease the annual grant to the Institute when it was well known that in the faith that such grants would continue a number of people have contributed to the Institute.  Expenditure in the last year upon the building has been £78-13-5, for newspapers and periodicals £20 for a total of £98-13-5.  Two items are not likely to occur again; £20-3-10 for Mr Smelt’s salary, and the expense of finishing a room for the librarian to live in £15-2-1, amounting to £35-5-11.  The income from subscriptions and the Government grant has been £39-11-0.  The treasurer Mr Oldham is not at hand to say whether the English & Australian Copper Co. has paid it annual donation of £10 or not.  Mr Henry Ayers has advised that he has placed £20 to the credit of the Institute, to be regarded not as an annual gift, but as a donation.  Income from members’ tickets and Mr Smelt’s tuition in the 1st quarter was £9-2-6, in the second quarter £11-14-6 from members’ tickets, for the third quarter £12-17-6 and for the present quarter £14.  Total income has been therefore £87-5-6 without the English & Australian Copper Co.’s £10.  Lighting cost £16-2-2 and firewood £17-10-0 (totalling £33-12-2).

There are 747 books in the library and 1,546 have attended the reading room from 1 January to 31 August.

Elected: Vice-President Marshall MacDermott; Treasurer, the Manager of the Union Bank; Secretary, Mr Lees; Committee comprising Messrs Stephens, Corey, Hosking, Roach and Dennis.
