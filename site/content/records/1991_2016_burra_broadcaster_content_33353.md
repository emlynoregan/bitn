Goyder YAC has received funding to stage events for National Youth Week.  They will arrange:

A Youth Forum called ‘SPEAK UP!’

A Dance Party in the Burra Town Hall with entertainment provided by SAFM.

The forum will be an opportunity to canvass what services are lacking for youth in the district and what needs to be done and will form the basis for lobbying local government and other agencies on behalf of the district’s youth.
