Stony Gap Wind Farm is still under development plan assessment (against the provisions of the Goyder Development Plan) by an independent consultant planner engaged by the Council.  The process is extensive and when completed will be presented to the Council Development Assessment Panel for consideration.  It will not be considered on 9 May meeting because the assessment process has not been completed.
