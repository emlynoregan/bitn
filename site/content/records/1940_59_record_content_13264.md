Mules Operation on Sheep

Mt Bryan Agricultural Bureau advises a demonstration of the much talked of Mules Operation on ringly tailed [sic*] sheep, which practically makes fly-blown sheep unknown, will be given in a flock of 300 weaners of Mr Charles Dare at his sheep yards near Mr Frank Thomasâ€™s homestead at 10 a.m. 13 April.  [*Reports of the event in the paper of 20 April refer of course to wrinkly tailed sheep.]
