P.H. Quirke writes in response to a comment of the Mayor’s at the Ratepayers’ Meeting that he had not visited Burra since the election.  Neither had he visited Mt Bryan or Hallett, but he has been to every other town from Black Springs to Jamestown some two or three times and nearly always because of invitations.  The last two months have not been very conducive to travel over many roads, especially at night.  He goes on to say Burra will have no reason to regret his election.  He considers the lack of a bitumen road to Burra an anomaly that needs correction – the lack of decent water and ETSA power make for a set of circumstances he regards as unparalleled.  If he achieved nothing for Burra it would hardly be worse than the record of the past 20 years.  He will be prepared to be judged after three years.
