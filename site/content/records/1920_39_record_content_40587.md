Christmas passed quietly in Burra.  Christmas Eve was lively and businesses reported good trade.  The Burra Brass Band gave a two hour performance before midnight when the band played Bells at Eventide to coincide with the Adelaide Town Hall Bells broadcast on the wireless.  The Band then adjourned for ice cream at Frank Harris’s and supper at E.F. Marston’s (the Band President).  The Band will give another concert next Sunday.
