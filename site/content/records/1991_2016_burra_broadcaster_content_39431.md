Unity Housing has secured a contract for four low income housing units to be built on the corner of Lower Thames and Roach Streets, Burra.*  Work is due for completion by late October 2014.  The contract comes through the Governmentâ€™s National Rental Affordability Scheme.  Some 80 homes are being built in rural/regional SA.  The 3-4 bedroom houses will be available for local key workers on incomes of $45,000 (single) to $108,000 p.a. for families at 75% of market rental and up to 50% discount on electricity cost.  Construction began a couple of weeks ago.
