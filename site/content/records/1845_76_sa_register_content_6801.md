He was also charged with assaulting PC Rogers in the execution of his duties.  PC Rogers said the prisoner had thrown a glass at him at the Burra Hotel on Saturday night and only his police helmet had protected him from injury.  On his way to the station Porter had said he would waylay Rogers and serve him as he had served Sergeant Rose; he would fetch him down ere he was aware, and if he had a sharp axe would cleave his way through the lot of them.  For this offence he was fined £5 with 21/- costs.  He was further bound over to keep the peace towards PC Rogers and all others for the term of six months and to be imprisoned until such security was given.  Porter advised His Worship to make out the warrant as soon as possible, for he did not intend to pay the fines.

Mr Mason of the Burra Hotel was sent for by Mr Lang and when he arrived was reprimanded for serving Porter drink.  He did not mean to say that Mason had done so with any bad intention, indeed on this occasion he believed he had done so in order to quieten him.  He did, however, believe that Mason and other publicans were acting contrary to the law by encouraging sech a fellow to frequent their houses.

Mr Mason disclaimed any intent to encourage Porter’s riotous conduct and he contradicted a report that he had previously given Porter money and drink to encourage him to create a disturbance on certain occasions.

Dr Lloyd, Dr Hill, Mr Mason and Mr Gollin begged to state in court that as members of Mr Kingston’s Committee they deprecated the idea that porter had been aided and abetted by their Committee, or sanctioned directly or indirectly.  They would instantly withdraw from the Committee if the slightest semblance of such conduct was evinced.

His Worship asked if they had intended to imply that he had said anything to implicate them or any of their Committee in Tom Porter’s outrages.  They said at once that they had no reason to believe any such thing.  They merely wished to dispel a disgraceful rumour which prevailed.

Richard Webb was charged with assaulting PC Taylor at the Burra Hotel on Saturday night.  After considerable evidence, Webb was fined 5/- plus 23/- costs.
