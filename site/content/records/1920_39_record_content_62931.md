The Mayor said ‘half the petitioners were little better than swaggies anyway and were nothing to the town.’

Cr Riggs thought they were making a lot of fuss over nothing and moved that the poll be held.

Cr Kellaway seconded the motion.

Cr Worth supported the motion because he could not bring himself to believe the petition a vote of no confidence in the Council

Cr Jeffery said the poll would be the end of the scheme; if the ratepayers had been in favour of the scheme there would not have been a petition.

Eventually Cr Riggs’s motion was carried.

The Mayor thought the £15 cost of a poll ‘was a wicked waste of the ratepayers’ money.’
