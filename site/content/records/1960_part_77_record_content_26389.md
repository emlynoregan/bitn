Burra Show was held on Saturday in fine weather and drew a record number of entries and a record gate taking of £258.  Mr Res Warnes, as President of the Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society, opened the show.  The day dawned with misty rain, but soon cleared to a fine day.  The Flower Pavilion looked a picture. The display of school work was excellent. Grain and fodder, fruit and vegetables, cooking, needlework and Youth Club displays combined well.  The strong support of exhibitors from the Clare District was evident throughout.  There was a good variety of sideshows.  Samson the Strongman proved the most popular of the tent shows.  Young’s Caterers of Melrose again did a good job.  Local and visiting businesses provided a variety of machinery merchandise and vehicles.  Quite a good crowd attended the dance in the main pavilion at night, when door takings amounted to £50.  The Cascades Band provided the music for this event arranged by the Rural Youth Club.
