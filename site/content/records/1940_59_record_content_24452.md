Father Christmas arrived at Matthews Emporium last Friday at 2.30 p.m. for the first time in five years.  Many children were amazed that with trains not running Father Christmas could still keep his appointment.  He arrived in Mr Bevanâ€™s decorated bus and carried a large bag of sweets.  He took orders for the 24th, provided a postal service for 142 letters and distributed 400 bags of sweets before departing for Matthews Emporium at Riverton at 5 p.m.
