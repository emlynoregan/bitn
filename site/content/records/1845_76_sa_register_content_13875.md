A public temperance meeting was held on Wednesday in the Primitive Methodist Chapel.  For various reasons the attendance was small.  Mr J. Skews Sen. took the chair and addresses were given by Revs Davidson and Whittaker.  Several people signed the pledge after the meeting.

Obituary.  On Thursday the remains of a man called Tongue were brought to the hospital here.  He had been the overseer at Hughes’ Redbanks Station and was coming to the Burra for medical advice when he grew worse on the journey and died at Canowie.  An inquest was not judged necessary.

[Edward Francis Tongue died 20 December 1860 Canowie, residence North Redbanks aged 32.]
