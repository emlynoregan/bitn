Burra Boy Scouts

The Group Committee now numbers 12 adults.  The committee has decided the old Methodist Church property at Hanson is an ideal location and the ten minute drive from Burra is not considered significant.  Negotiations with the trustees are under way.  The advantages are that the Cubs and Scouts can each have a separate building and can meet simultaneously.  Equipment can be left in situ from one meeting to the next.  The distance will test scout and parent loyalty to the cause and the necessary roster to get scouts to the site will cement parent involvement.  The first meeting of the First Burra Boy Scout Troop and the First Burra Cub Pack is scheduled for Friday 26 September.  Parents are urged to attend.  Registered Scout Leaders to date are Mr G. Webster, Mr W. Barker, Mr W. Salter and Cub Leader is Mrs I. Tamassy.  Costs are 50 cents on nomination and 10c per night. Uniforms will not be required for four or five months, which is time enough to predict the success or failure of the venture.
