Editorial on the importance of Broken Hill to SA, especially in trade in a time of depression, but also in providing jobs for the SA unemployed.  A large proportion of the 10,000 in the area are of SA origin.  He argues for a better rail connection: eventually eliminating the break of gauge and also for better tariff arrangements.
