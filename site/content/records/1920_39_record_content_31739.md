Weather.  Since the last issue conditions have been extreme.  Friday morning saw extremely windy and dusty conditions with a couple of heavy showers later about 9 p.m.  On Saturday it was cold and boisterous with driving showers followed by steady rain overnight mixed with some snow around midnight.  About 50 points were recorded.  On Sunday night there was a severe frost.  To the east Friday and Saturday brought hellish dust storms which were blood red in places and browny-black elsewhere.  At Ketchowla a large lorry, in gear and with the brakes on, was blown 200 yards into a tree.

Out of doors the dust was suffocating and was only modified indoors where it lay thickly on everything and lights were needed all day.  Old and experienced pastoralists reckon these two days were the worst dust storms in 50 years.  Saturday was worse than Friday.  Mr & Mrs W.H. Sandland left Balah at 9 a.m. for the journey to Burra that normally takes 1½ to 2 hours.  They arrived at 5.40 p.m.  A following motor lorry kept bumping into them, its driver unable to see in the dust.  At one stage they could not hear the engine of the lorry nor the horn and were forced to stop for three hours, unable to see past the bonnet of the car.  When they started it was with difficulty that they were able to confirm they were still on the road.  Further on they were delayed for a further 1½ hours.  In a slightly clearer moment Mr Sandland found a lamb almost buried in dust, but when extricated it was still alive.  Shearing began at Redcliffe recently and Mr McBride will lose much of the value of the wool with the dust deeply embedded in it.  Rain is badly needed and efforts to move stock also produce heavy losses.  Freezing conditions have also caused big mortality among flocks in the ‘inside country’.  To the west and south the rain has been welcomed, but hail and snow will result in sheep losses.  Snow in gullies persisted on Sunday around Ulooloo and Mt Bryan.  Mt Bryan East recorded 86 points and part of Koonoona (Minnipa) received 110 points.  At both Burra and Booborowie the total was about 90 points, but not enough rain fell to the east to settle the dust.
