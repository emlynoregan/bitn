Football

E.F. Brady [Edward Foster Brady] writes from Perth WA regarding the jubilee of the Burra Football Club which played its first match at Clare on 24 May 1879.  Brady says he does not know who to write to and has not corresponded with the Record since F.W. Holder was editor and George Dawson mechanical manager.  He says he has a photo of 20 footballers with Dr R. Brummitt as President that was presented to him in token of seven years as captain at a meeting held at Richardson’s Commercial Hotel presided over by Vice-President Mr John Finlay Duff.  Jack Warnes took his place as Captain.  He recalls one match at Aberdeen when Clare invited George Giffen of Adelaide and his friend Tom Green to play for them, but they were dismayed when on arrival Giffen & Green donned Burra’s colours.  Giffen would put his hand in his opponent’s face: ‘caused quite an upset of that player’s intentions’.  He recalls practice games on Brewery Flat when they took on Allcomers – like employees of Henderson’s (blacksmiths) and were sometimes outnumbered 3 to 1.  The SA Mining Association came up with the land for an oval and Bill Phillips & Jimmy Launder built the stone wall.  There were memorable games against Norwood and Port Adelaide.  During the war he had a haemorrhage and lost most of his sight and made him an invalid.  He mentions his five sons who fought in the Great War.

Edgar who worked with Billy Pearce in Kooringa was killed at Gallipoli.

Ernie who was born in Burra in Dr Steven’s home was killed in France
