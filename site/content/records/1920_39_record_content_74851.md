A strong argument of Mr Warnes was the lack of water in the district for travelling stock.  He felt extra rates should be put on Adelaide folk who had good water and if the water was intended for Pt Augusta and Whyalla why was the farmer levied?

Cr E. Finch also favoured a route on the dry side of Robertstown and so through Burra.  He also spoke of the poor quality of Burra’s present supply, which would not lather and corroded machinery etc.  He thought the scheme would pay for itself.

Cr M. de N. Lucas for Hanson Ward favoured the Hanson route, as it was the most economical and would bring business to the town.  It would be a boon to householders.  He said the district’s water table had dropped probably due to lucerne cultivation and as a result he did not have an ample supply for his sheep.

Rex. C. Warnes spoke in favour of the route through drier country.  The Burra water supply was poor in quality and he favoured a route north of Burra along the railway and spoke of the lack of water for travelling stock.  He spoke of the high cost of maintaining windmills in the dusty dry country.

Clem Bailey of Hanson spoke in support of Mr de Lucas and also spoke of the drop in the water table and for a Hanson route.  Most people were afraid of the cost of a pipeline from the main, though large landowners might favour it.

The Mayor said many thought the scheme could benefit the town.  Burra had a good system of pipes, but the water quality caused dissatisfaction.  Murray water could well lead to the establishment of a freezing works.  The town once had a large brewery and also a freezing and ice works, but one had been forced to close down owing to the poor quality of the water.  He favoured a Burra route, but if the Hanson route were chosen Burra would welcome a supply through a spur line.  The town depended on business done by the farmer and grazier and pastoralist.  The closing of the ballast quarry, freezing works etc. had hit them hard.  He was not prepared to commit the ratepayers to a higher rate, but would place the question to a poll.  When questioned about the flowers on the very handsome Floral Float which took pride of place in the great Floral Day Procession in Adelaide in 1937 he said they were made of paper.

Cr S.H. Robinson supported the Mayor and believed ratepayers would pay for a decent water supply.

A.L. Walker, draper, speaking for himself thought a route through Clare and Laura and Jamestown would serve better.  [He clearly feared higher rates as a consequence of the Burra route and said he paid £465 all told in rates on business premises and never had a tap on the place.]

A.L. Bence, draper, favoured the Burra route, saying it would stimulate closer settlement and bring trade.  The line should not pass through the well-watered country.

Cr D. Keynes also favoured the Burra route.  Id Booborowie had a permanent water supply it would encourage folk to take up more land.

T.H. Woollacott said in 15 years on Council he had never heard one complaint as to the local water supply.  The new supply might be a boon, but what would become of the present expensive equipment?  Would it all be scrapped?  The town had been on the present water supply for 70 years and gardens were as good as ever.  [In fact Burra had only had reticulated water from November 1884 – 55 years rather than 70, though a mere handful of Burra North residents had a supply from 1878.]
