The Tariff.  There is 1⅔ column of detail of the meeting chaired by the Mayor, W.C.L. West.

Cr J. Wise moved a long motion in opposition to the proposed tariff.  He considered how the tariff would affect primary industries, both agriculture and mining.  Mr McGilchrist 2nd.  He considered how it would affect the working man in particular.  The tariff is supposed to protect local industry, but it is absurd.  To protect one small wire netting manufacturer in NSW the whole country will pay £3 per ton duty on imported netting.  There will be 3d per lb on tobacco and 6d a lb on tobacco leaf.  3d per gallon is added to kerosene and there are 15 million gallons of duty free kerosene in stock on which importers will make £137,000 etc.

Mr Winnall said that though intended to protect Australian industry it also ‘protected’ those things it was impossible for us to produce.

Dr Sangster also spoke in support of the motion, as the burden would fall unequally on the poor.

Motion carried.

Cr W.G. Neville then moved a motion condemning the recent increase in Parliamentary salaries.  2nd E.K. Collins and carried unanimously.

The propositions as carried are to be forwarded to Sir Frederick Holder, MP for the district.
