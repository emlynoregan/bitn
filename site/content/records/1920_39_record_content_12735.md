Burra Institute.  Annual Meeting saw 18 of the 300 members attend.  The present debt is £1,400.  There were 5,869 books in the library at the end of 1922 which had risen to 6,123 at end of 1923, allowing for the withdrawal of 219.  Membership stood at 282.  The lighting plant has carried us over 5 years since it was installed, but in the last 12 months the batteries have been getting weaker.  Two have been repaired and one replaced.  The running cost for the 5 years has been £156-12-7 or £2-12-2 a month.  We hope soon to be connected to the town supply.

Improvements in the year included a new ceiling in the lodge room at £20-10-0, a new 1,000 gallon tank at £7-15-0, new shelving in the members’ room at £4-13-6 and doors on the stairs to the gallery at £13-15-6.
