Letter from ‘Dog Owner’ noting Mr Warnes failed to thank Mr Killicoat for providing the sheep or Mr McBride for presenting a trophy at the Sheep Dog Trials.  Was this because both were on the much-abused committee?  But why was Mr George Melrose not thanked for presenting a medal.  It is time Mr Warnes ‘climbed off his perch’.
