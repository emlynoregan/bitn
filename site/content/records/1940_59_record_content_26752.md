Town Councillor for eight years and incoming Mayor.

Betting shops would encourage betting by minors.

Sports had flourished in the town before betting shops.

In the days of betting shops it had been difficult to get young people interested in sports because they wanted to listen to the races.

Illegal betting was better under any circumstances because young people would not be encouraged to go into betting shops.

Witness 10.  Mr Max Morton

Blacksmith

Betting shops were a menace to sports in the town.

He knew of teams which had to go away short because of betting and of one young man who refused to play football because he wanted to bet.

‘Two young Salvation Army lassies’ and the Church of England Minister were ready to offer evidence, but it was not accepted as it would have been merely repetitive.

Summing up the case for a betting shop Mr Lemon said illegal betting was rife in Burra and if legal betting was an evil then illegal betting was a greater evil, breaking not only a moral law but a state law.  A betting shop was the only remedy for that evil.  Betting shops did not appear to have a great effect on sports and no undue influence on young people.  Their effect on businesses was hard to judge because economic conditions were so different from the period before the war.

Summing up the case against a betting shop Mr Brebner said the evidence against had been given by people of repute in the town.  Seven of the nine JPs were opposed to betting shops.  Only one minister of religion had given evidence; the rest were ordinary citizens.  Illegal betting might be apparent, but was not flagrant.  Evidence showed that illegal betting was now about half what betting had been in the legal days.  A betting shop would probably double the amount of betting.  It had not been shown that a town was deteriorating from the lack of a betting shop.  The public lost about £20 out of every £100 invested in betting shops.

Mr R.C. Lott volunteered evidence:

He did not care if there was betting on races or not.

All he wanted was fair play.

He had been Captain and Vice-Captain of the football team and was now a trainer and there had never been a problem in fielding a full team.

Mr Morton had not been connected actively with football for many years.

A decision will be announced later.
