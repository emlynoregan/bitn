A Bolt.  Two horses attached to a trap from Booborowie Station were tied to a tree opposite Drew & Crewes yesterday when they were frightened.  They managed to break the rope and charged across the street straight for the doorway to the shop.  Ten yards from it one of the horses fell and was dragged to the footpath by the other.  But for that, they must either have shot into the door or the plate glass window.  The animals were gradually calmed and no damage was done to them.
