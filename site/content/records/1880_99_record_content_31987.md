The Fountain.  After a long delay the fountain in Jubilee Avenue is at last being re-erected.  Much of the masonry work had to be dug up to get at and alter the pipes and the opportunity was taken to align the fountain with one of the rows of trees.  The base is being rebuilt in three steps as before.
