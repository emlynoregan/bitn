BCS.  Staff Profile: Anne Drew

I am teaching Year 3 this year.  My first teaching appointment was at Hallett Primary, which I enjoyed very much.  I have also taught in Adelaide, at Athelstone Primary and at Farrell Flat last year.  I am originally from Adelaide and my parents still live there.  I have a brother living in Melbourne.  I now live at Leighton on a farm with my husband, Chris.  Living on a farm is quite a contrast with city living and I love it.  I have a number of challenges, including redecorating the house, trying to establish a garden using water said to be suitable only for palm trees and couch grass, riding my bike on dirt roads without getting a puncture every time and working in the canteen during the football season.
