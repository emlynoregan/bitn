Roger Burford

Hard machine compositor and proprietor of SA’s Country Trader (covering Smithfield to Quorn) and have 19 years’ experience in printing and allied trades.  With new printing equipment the Trader and the commercial side of our business is in a position to expand.  Since living in Mt Bryan I have come to see the need of taking an interest and involvement in Federal, State and Local Government.  I believe that if the Fabian Socialist Governments of the day at Federal and State levels are returned to office, we may witness the greatest attack ever made on our local government system.  I believe small local governments are capable of meeting best the individual needs of ratepayers and businesses and so should be kept local.
