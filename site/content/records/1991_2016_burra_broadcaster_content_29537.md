Burra Branch CWA has a new home with the opening of the Mary Warnes Room in the Burra Town Hall by the State President Betty Tothill.  40 local members and guests attended.  Among those present was Carolyn Cooke, a granddaughter of CWA founder in SA Mrs Mary Warnes.  She presented a history of Mrs Warnes’ Life signed by the Governor Marjorie Jackson-Nelson.  The redecorated room is to the right of the foyer in the Burra Town Hall.  An air conditioning system has been installed and the room has been painted in warm colours with a frieze around the top of the walls.

The CWA celebrates 73 years of service in SA.  Mrs Warnes was the inaugural president and held the position from 1929 to 1941.  The CWA grew to 14,000 members at its peak, but membership is declining, though the warmth of friendship and fellowship remains as strong as ever.

The Burra branch has had several different venues during its lifetime.  Mary Warnes is remembered in Burra with a stained glass window in St Mary’s Church and her name on the small restroom for mothers in the main street and now with the naming of this room in the Town Hall.
