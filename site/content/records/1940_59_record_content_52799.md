SA Housing Trust in Burra

The six houses erected in Queen Street have been completed and will be handed over to occupants in the near future.  Some of the workers have moved on to Robertstown.  The houses look very pretty, but at over £2,000 each are more than the ordinary working man or returned soldier can afford, or be able to find the deposit for.  That is expected to be 25% to 33%.  It was expected when they were mooted that the deposit would be about £300.  It has been alleged that the Trust will not rent the homes, so the result will be interesting.  Will they be left empty to rot?  Will some Government Department acquire them?  Will desperate people grab them at any price?
