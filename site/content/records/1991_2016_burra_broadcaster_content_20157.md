Welcome Inn’s most recent Coffee & Desert Night (they are held about once a term) was held at the Uniting Church Hall last Thursday.  A most entertaining debate was staged on the topic ‘Women Need Chocolate’.

The Penguin Club team argued for the proposition and the Welcome Inn team opposed it.  The verdict was in favour of the Penguin Club.  The Burra Penguin Club is 33 years old, is designed to give women the opportunity to practise speaking in public and to conduct meetings, and meets on the first Tuesday in the month in the staff room at BCS.
