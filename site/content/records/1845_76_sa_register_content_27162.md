The Recent Railway Accident: Editorial Comment

The enquiry into the recent accident was held at Kooringa on 10 February.  The evidence points clearly to the conclusion reached by the jury: that the accident was due to the neglect of specific rules, which have been framed for the daily inspection of the track before a train passes over it.  As for the specific portion of track involved; it needed special attention due to the soft nature of the soil used in the embankment.  Added to that the geography of the country is such as to create the probability of damage in the event of heavy rainfall, such as occurred on Tuesday night.  The evidence of James Peak was that flood as great as that of Tuesday had occurred before, but in the absence of hail the culvert had not been blocked and the embankment had not been damaged.  The loose nature of the embankment was known to the driver and the guard and it seems strange that this information was not conveyed to the Engineer-in-Chief.  Perhaps if ganger Navin had reported the flood of last year, even though it had not caused damage, greater precautions would have been taken in travelling over the embankment.  The immediate cause was the failure to walk the line before the train passed.  The need for such inspections was evident on the very morning of the accident on the section south of where it occurred.  Ganger McKenzie noticed a slip, which was then remedied before the passenger train was due.

Mr Mais cited section 6 clause 23 that requires inspection every morning before the first train.

Henry Branford, Inspector of the Permanent Way between Roseworthy and Burra referred to a memorandum, signed by Mr Patterson, of 10 April 1874 limiting the need for such to winter months.  In October 1874 Branford circulated gangers requesting them to discontinue early inspection of the lines in the summer months.  No provision was made for action in exceptional circumstances, such as after heavy rainfall.

We believe, however, that the regulations cited by Mr Mais were issued after the Patterson memorandum and that they superseded and cancelled any former rules with which they were inconsistent.  Yet Branford states, strangely enough, that he considered Pattersonâ€™s order took precedence over regulations issued 12 months later.

We concur with the conclusion of the jury that the action of Mr Branford is highly censurable, and is the direct cause of the accident.

In contrast the prompt actions of the guard George Gitsham are much to be commended.

We do not know what further steps may be taken, but the matter ought not to be allowed to rest where it is.
