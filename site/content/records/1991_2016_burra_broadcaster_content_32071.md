Toni Gisi has started Goyder Auto Service at the rear of the BP Service Station.  In the late 1960s his parents Vic & Lotte Gisi started a car repair business in what is now known as the Bazaar Building.  [Next to the BP Service Station.]  The business was H.V. & L. Gisi Auto & Electrical Repairs.  In time Toni was employed as an apprentice.  After completing his apprenticeship, Toni worked for BEA Mercedes in Adelaide and then Frank Wann Motors.  He has now returned to Burra to establish a car repair business.  [Photo and advertisement.]
