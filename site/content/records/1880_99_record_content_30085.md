The Burra Mine.  [Reprint of an article from The Advertiser.]

The Advertiser has received a number of complaints against the proprietors of the Burra Mine for allowing such a valuable asset to be idle when its working would benefit the district, colony and the owners.  It is a matter of public interest.  If it is true that a rich deposit of ore lies there and the mine would pay well in the present copper market, then an important asset is being neglected.  There may be no legal obligation to work the mine, but there is a moral responsibility.  Thus SAMA should either re-open the mine themselves, or make liberal terms with anyone who is prepared to do so - or show cause why either choice is impracticable.

Every practical Burra miner seems to firmly believe the mine is far from exhausted.  From 1845-1877, 234,648 tons of ore were raised.  The early mining was not on lode, but on bunches of ore.  Exploration for the lode was comparatively limited.  At deeper levels lodes ran north-south, but the deepest levels explored are shallow by comparison with other mines.  No exploration has gone below 70 fathoms, which is 1/6 the depth of gold exploration in Victoria.  One shaft [Morphett’s] went 30 fathoms lower, but without levels or crosscuts.  High % ore was found, but not explored.

Rapidly advancing science could also make viable the ¼ million tons of waste heap estimated to average 4% copper.  It is time, with copper at its present price, for something to be done.  Presently tributers are earning fair wages and even their crude and laborious methods suggest what might be done with proper methods.  Disposal of the property to another entity would boost the value of the company’s assets in the town.  Raising capital may be made difficult by recent failures of speculations, but here the ore body is proved.  Remember that the original capital invested was a mere £12,300 and the dividends were £800,000.
