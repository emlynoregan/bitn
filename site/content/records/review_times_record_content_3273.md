Burra National Trust is concerned about heritage implications of the Ludgvan Street bypass.  Chairman Mrs Maureen Wright said they were concerned about three historical sites:

The former Settler’s Home Hotel1, which was built in 1855 and later became a private home.

The White Hart Hotel site.  The hotel was built in the 1850s and destroyed by fire in 1916.

The Aberdeen Croquet Club lawns and shelter shed.  The club operated from 1934-19502.

They were also concerned about the Redruth Methodist Church, which dates from 1874 and would be very close to the deviation.  It was nominated for State Heritage Listing.

Mrs Wright believed that when the Morgan-Burrs road was sealed there would be a complete bypass of the town and it would be a pity to lose these heritage sites for a short term development.

If the deviation were to go ahead there should be archaeological work done on two of the sites before they move in.

[Notes:

1 This was not known as the Settler’s Home, but either as the Bushman’s Home or the Bushman’s Rest and it was licensed from September 1855 to 1867.  Referred to as the ‘Bushman’s Home in SA Register 24 March 1863, page 3.

2 The Aberdeen Croquet Club began playing in 1928 on grounds near the Court House.  The lawns referred to above were then growing and were opened for play on 16 February 1929.  I have not found a date for the end of the club, but they had an AGM c. October 1958 and seemed to have operated in the 1958-59 season.  Council agreed to pay the water rates for the Aberdeen Croquet Club (except for excess water) in December 1962, which suggests they were then still active.]
