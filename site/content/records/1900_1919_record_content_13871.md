Obituary.  Mr James Mann of Hallett died suddenly on Friday.  He came to Burra and worked for Tommy Hutton, a blacksmith in a shed almost opposite Dr Sangster Seniorâ€™s and later he had his own business close to where D. Jones has his paint shop.  He later went to Aberdeen and had a business on the site on which the old National Bank now stands.  He then moved to Mt Bryan and later still took on the hotel there.  After that he took the Hallett Hotel now occupied by Mr Lewis.  He made and lost a fortune.  His last place of business was at the hotel near the Hallett Railway Station.  He married Miss Annie Armstrong, who was at the Burra Hotel, now the hospital.  He leaves two sons and two daughters: Jim (Burra), W. (Broken Hill), Mrs B. Bourman (Burra) & Mrs J. Sutton (Broken Hill).
