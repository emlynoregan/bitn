No tenders were received for the construction of the swimming pool.

The Clerk said there was £403 in hand.

[The Mayor and Cr Jennison had a further pointless altercation over blames for this unproductive situation.]

Cr Dow said the pool was going to cost £800, they had £403 and he was not in favour of starting till they had the money in hand.

The Mayor said there were promises of 128 bags of cement as good as cash.

Cr Jennison asked the Mayor for a special meeting in committee to discuss the matter and for the Mayor at such a meeting ‘to define . . . what idea you have in mind regarding the swimming pool’. 

The Mayor said he had provided £20 worth of plans and specifications free.  What more could he do? He couldn’t run away from his own work to build a swimming pool.

Cr Jennison: ‘All we ask you is to tell us what scheme you have in the back of your mind to build this pool.’

The Mayor: ‘What scheme.’

Cr Jennison moved for a special meeting and Cr Jeffery seconded.

The Mayor said that only for the referendum the Council would have had the money to build the pool.

Motion carried.
