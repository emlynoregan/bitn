‘Interested’ writes re the Burra Mine

Having read the Record’s report and its gloomy outlook ‘Interested’ wrote to a friend to see if the paper had overdrawn the case, but was told it was much underdrawn.  He came therefore to Burra to judge for himself and was surprised to see the town such a dull place.  A weekday in the shopping area looked like a Sunday.  He knew the mine was being worked in a small way, but any smaller and he would not have found anyone there at all.  It is a disgrace that it has taken five years to do so little.  He called it pig-rooting not mining.  The stopping of the tributers is one of the biggest mistakes possible.  They are the mainstay of the mine.  Talk of the difficulty of pumping out the open cut is tommy rot.  He then goes on to speculate on the possible richness of ore to be discovered when the water is lowered.
