Burra School Yard has been the scene for further accidents as a result of its dangerous condition.  In addition to the injuries reported last issue, Avis Auhl fell and broke her pelvis and another pupil received a severe shaking and bruising.  The Town Council has now resolved to write to the Education Department to try to get the playground paved and tarred.

The Local Board of Health has received a letter from the Burra High School Council enclosing a letter from the Education Department concerning the state of the school conveniences.  While acknowledging the need to install a septic system, the letter says many other schools also need one and Burra would have to wait its turn.

It was decided to write to the Department stating that the present toilets had been condemned by the Health Officer and unless necessary action was taken the Local Board of Health would have no option but to close the conveniences.
