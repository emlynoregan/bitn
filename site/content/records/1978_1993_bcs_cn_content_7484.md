[Later in a report of this incident it becomes confusing.  It says Greg Woolley and Craig McBride were swept away into Burra Creek, having previously reported this effort to be along the creek by Tregony Street.  It goes on to say they were saved by the bridge.  It reports that a week later Greg still had the imprint of the bridge pylon on his stomach.  Both men spent a short time in hospital.]
