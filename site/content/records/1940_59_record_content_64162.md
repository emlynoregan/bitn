Mr & Mrs R.H. Campbell were farewelled from Redruth Methodist Church on Sunday evening, 27 June.  They will live at Hamilton Park. There was community singing, a strip film on the blind man whose sight was restored by Christ and Mrs Satchell sang Will Ye No come back Again.  Rev. C. Christopher presented Mr & Mrs Campbell with a silver tray purchased through donations (and the balance in cash.)
