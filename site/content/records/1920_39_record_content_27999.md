Redruth Court/Burra Court

A couple of months ago Mr Bednall brought the question of changing the name of the court to the attention of Mr Nesbit SM.  Information has now come to hand that henceforth the court will be known as the Local Court of Burra.

Cr Riggs has suggested similar changes for Kooringa post office to Burra PO and Aberdeen post office to Burra North PO.  This is a good idea and would not affect local usage, nor would it require changes in title deeds.

J. Arthur of the Telephone Department here for some years has been transferred to Adelaide.

H.G. Jones accountant for Drew & Crewes Ltd for 16 years is moving to a similar position with Whiles & Ormiston, printers of Adelaide.  He will be missed in church work and at the bowling green.
