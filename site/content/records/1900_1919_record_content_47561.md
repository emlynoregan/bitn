Mr A. Shortridge of the local post office has moved to a job with the Electoral Dept.  Mr Crewes presented him with a travelling rug and a case of pipes on Saturday and said he was Burra born and he (Mr Crewes) had known his father 38 years before.  He had been leader of the Burra Coronation Band, which was so much diminished by the war, though its members remain enthusiastic.
