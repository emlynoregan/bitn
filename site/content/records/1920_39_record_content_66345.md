Salvation Army.  Over Easter the Salvation Army Brass Band from Port Adelaide and Kilkenny visited.  A severe dust storm spoiled the Booborowie concert on Saturday.  On Sunday morning they played in several Burra Streets before 11 a.m. and in the afternoon at Burra Hospital.  It was too cold for an open-air concert in Market Square at 8.30 p.m. and this was transferred to the Methodist Church.  The concert in the Salvation Army Hall on Monday night was a great success.  Capt. Cresswell thanks all who billeted the men.
