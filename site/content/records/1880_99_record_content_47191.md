Kooringa Primitive Methodist Church Anniversary last Sunday was largely attended.  Rev. R.J. Daddow’s address on Sunday evening is printed - running to 1 column on Labour, Capital and Unions.

[Daddow was generally quite supportive of the role of unions in their efforts to get a fair deal for workers and spoke favourably of the formation of boards of arbitration and conciliation.  Although it was a moderate and carefully worded argument it apparently provoked an interjector.]
