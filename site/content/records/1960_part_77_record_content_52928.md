Burra Railway Centenary

On Saturday a train hauled by two Rx class locomotives and carrying approximately 600 passengers drew into Burra station 100 years to the minute after the arrival of the first train in 1870.  The train carried 340 passengers from Adelaide and an additional 178 from Hanson.  It arrived at precisely 12.45 p.m.  It was greeted by Mr R. J. Jeffery, Chairman of the Burra Burra DC.  [Mr Jefferyâ€™s speech is printed.]  Mr E.C. Allen MP then also spoke.  [His speech is printed.]  Mr Peter Shearer, Acting Traffic Manager for SAR then spoke.  [His mother was formerly Miss Elsie Tiver of Burra.]  Mr P.F. Pollnitz spoke for the SA Government Tourist Bureau followed by Mr Ken Wicker.  The train then broke through a commemorative ribbon.

A number of people dressed in period costume.  Countless photographs were taken of the train in the station before it moved on to the cutting at the rear of the showgrounds for further photographs.  Some 200 of the passengers had a bus tour of Burra and another bus ran a commuter service between the station and Market Square.  Burra Kindergarten ladies provided hot soup and a cake and sweets stall in the goods shed.  An official afternoon tea was held in the Kooringa Hotel hosted by Mr & Mrs Jeffery.

The engines were turned on the turntable near the Bon Accord crossing and they were watered and coaled for the return run.  The train left for Adelaide at 3.40 p.m.  [Photo at the Burra Station of Rx 224 & 207.]
