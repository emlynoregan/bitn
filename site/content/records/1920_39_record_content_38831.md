Rev. Jarvis also spoke in support.  He said it had been suggested there be a fee of about £9-9-0 p.a.  If it were necessary to charge a fee he suggested it be graduated: sat £3 for first year then £4-10-0 and £6 by third year.  Large numbers were at school due to the depression.  Numbers could be cut by raising the entrance standard.  If numbers at school were halved the state would benefit.  Parents at Burra would not be able to afford to send children to Peterborough.

Mr Bednall said if economies needed to be made it could be done without closing schools.  Their Council favoured fees for High School education, but wanted this coupled with bursaries so that talented children would not be denied education.  The number of children at High School could be halved with a corresponding saving in expenditure.  Rather than see the school closed they would prefer to see it cut to only one teacher.  (Presently there was a head, two assistants and a Domestic Arts teacher & a Woodwork teacher; both of which were half-time.)  He had got through High school with bursaries, gone on to college and university and got a degree at no cost to himself.

The local MPs supported, but they were committed to free education.

Mr Bednall clarified his position, saying he did not want fees, but they were preferable to closing the school.

The Minister said they had difficulties in getting men with suitable qualifications for the enquiry. It was purely an advisory committee and its report would not have been made public, but for the press and certain opposition MPs.  The Government had been urged to economise when the education budget had reached £1,000,000 in 1929-30 (including university subsidies).

In 1920 attendance of the 70,000 was 67%

In 1930 attendance of the 80,000 was 87%

In 1920 teachers were asked to teach classes of 100 and this had been much reduced, needing more teachers.

In 1920 it cost £3-19-0 per child and the comparable cost in 1931 was £5-12-0.

The Government thought they could achieve the necessary 20% reduction in cost under the Premiers’ Plan without materially disturbing the Department.  The Bishop of Adelaide had urged increasing the school leaving age to 16, but they could not accept that.
