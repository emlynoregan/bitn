Finance.

The present Council leaves office with a debit balance of £141-9-10, which is an improvement of £241-1-4 on last year.  [These figures accord with the opening debit, of £382-11-2, but seem at odds with the £182 improvement mentioned at the start of the report, though that was estimated for the end of the year.]

The Mayor thanked Councillors, and the Town Clerk, Mr J.D. Cave.

Cr Sampson, in moving the adoption of the Mayor’s report had a few minor reservations.
