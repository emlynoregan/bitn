Redruth Court, 12 August.

Austin v. Rabbich for £29.

Austin sued Rabbich for failure to keep premises in a tenantable state of repair during a yearly tenancy, also for rates, for wilful damage, for not cleaning the premises and for taking away a shop counter and meat hooks.  All charges were denied.

Richard Austin said he had let the butcher shop, cellar, kitchen, stables and yards to the defendant, on a verbal agreement, for ten years at £4 per week in 1878.  Austin took possession a month ago.  Defendant left on 16 May.  Austin inspected the premises the next day.  The inside walls had been chopped as with a chopper.  Fastenings were off windows, some glass was broken, there was rotten meat and dirty pickle in a stone salter.  Half a load of filth and dirt was removed and repairs to the shop cost £10.  There was £2-10-0 to clean the yards and repair a fence and £1-15-11 for a carpenter.  [Other costs are listed.]  Mrs Austin said the cellar was under her drawing room and had been offensive sometime previous to the defendant’s vacating the premises.

David Jones, painter, corroborated the above and said cleaning alone would account for about £2.

J.D. Cave inspected the premises on 10 July and saw a lot of putrid meat in the cellar.

W.A. Rabbich denied all and said the only agreement was for £4 a week rent.  The premises had been cleaned out about18 months before he took them and had last been cleaned in 1881.  The walls and ceiling of the butcher’s shop were washed once every year in addition, after the flies were gone.  Walls were not injured when he left on 16 May.  Plaintiff had made no complaint till after he had left.

The court gave a verdict for £4-15-0 stating that they did not think the defendant chopped the wall or that it was done with his knowledge.

[Note the surprising information that Mrs Austin seems to have used her drawing room not only while the smell was offensive before 16 May, but also until at least 10 July when J.D. Cave saw putrid meat there!]
