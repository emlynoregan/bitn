Mrs H.J. Bruce lives in a cottage near the Council Depot in Thames St.  She was born a Miss Prior and lived at World’s End where her father had a farm.  She married Richard Bruce of World’s End and they raised a family of eight and also several fatherless grandchildren.  She used to milk cows and attend to fowls and ducks as well as being a sort of District Nurse and acting as a midwife.  Today she is a great-great grandmother aged 84.
