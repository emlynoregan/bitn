Burra Regional Art Gallery.  On Sunday 26 April Donald Richardson, artist and educator will give an illustrated talk on Australian War Memorials.  He has just completed a book on the subject The Digger Image.

The Burra War Memorial is a remarkable 12 m high granite column surmounted by a 2.4 m bronze figure of a digger in the ‘parry’ position.  It was modelled by a Mr Willmett, an Adelaide fibrous plaster manufacturer, about whom nothing more is known.  It was cast by the Adelaide firm of A.W. Dobbie, cost the large sum of c. £3,500 and was unveiled by Prime Minister W.M. Hughes in 1922.  The Burra Record 10 March 1920 said the organising committee did not want a ‘stiff expressionless figure’ i.e. an imported marble figure [like so many others’].
