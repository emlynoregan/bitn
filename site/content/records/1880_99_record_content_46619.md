Editorial on The Central Land Board.

[The article expresses dissatisfaction with the way it allots land suggesting it was too frequently giving it to those who already had thousands of acres.]

One who has a large area applied for four blocks for non-residence and expected possibly to get none or one and was surprised to get all four when others, who were prepared to live on the land, got none.  Two or three landless teamsters applied, but failed.  The editor feels it is time the suburban lands at Douglas were offered.  This was promised 12 months ago, but nothing has happened.

[These would have been small blocks perhaps more like the workingmenâ€™s blocks that were the subject of enquiry earlier in the year, though they hardly seem suitable for the purpose unless irrigation water was to be made available too.]
