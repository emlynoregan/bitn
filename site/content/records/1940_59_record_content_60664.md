Burra Footballers visited Kadina at the weekend.  Arrangements were made for accommodation and entertainment with the Kadina Football Club, but not one representative of that club met the visitors on arrival.  The boys were accommodated and made their own fun, going to the trots in the afternoon and to a dance in the evening.  They were also given a football lecture by Bob Quinn.
