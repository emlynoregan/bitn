Burra Town Council, 21 March

Dr Steele requested the Council guarantee the Burra Civil Defence Committee up to £100 for bandages and dressings in the event of an actual air raid.

The Town Clerk complained of an unwarranted attack on him by one of the Councillors at the last meeting.  He looked to the Council for protection in his position of Clerk.

Mr Mayor said he had carried out his work for many years well.  If a Councillor again abused the Clerk he would stick to the Standing Orders of Council and ruled there be no further discussion on the matter.

Cr Lott moved His Worship’s ruling not be upheld, but he was not seconded.

The Burra Electric Supply Co. said concerning the reduction in streetlights that the Council should have 30 lights at £4-16-0 and 5 at £5-18-0 p.a.  At present there were 59 lights.  The light in the Rotunda was supplied free and this might also be cut by the Company.  Councillors will inspect their wards and decide on which lights would be cut.

The Local Government Department has instructed the removal of all direction sign; the posts to be left standing.

Parking in front of the SAFU store is to be prohibited after a request from the Defence Department.

Dr Steele addressed Council on plans for local stores to keep a quantity of medical supplies for use in the event of an air raid.  The Council was asked to guarantee £100, which would not be spent unless an air raid actually occurred.  The Committee also wanted £20 in cash for medical supplies now.

Council agreed to the guarantee request and granted £15 cash.

Cr Reed advised he would not be able to attend further Council meetings because of military duties.  He was given leave of absence till June, when he could resign and the vacancy could be filled at an ordinary election.
