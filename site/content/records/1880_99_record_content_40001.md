The rates bring in nearly half what they did a few years ago and total income has gone down to about half what it was.

In 1886 extra works were done and consequently an overdraft of over £300 was brought about, since when the Council has had to economise in every way.

This has made the position of Councillor unpopular.

Though this year starts in credit there is £200 in bonds to redeem and coupons of nearly another £100.

Rates this year are not likely to bring in over £500 on the reduced assessment, so there will be little available for public works.

This is also true for the other accounts (Health and Park Lands) where great care will have to be exercised.

In the Waterworks account there is £308-5-7 which has allowed for a further reduction for the ratepayers.

All in all the balance sheet is something the Council deserves credit for and is, under the circumstances, satisfactory.
