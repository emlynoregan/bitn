Mt Bryan News

An information bay on wind farms is to be installed in the disused Railway Reserve at the northern end of the town.  Last Thursday a 44 metre long wind turbine blade was installed at the site, as the first step in this project of the Mt Bryan Progress Association.  The blade, weighing 8.5 tonnes, was donated by Suzlon.
