The Band accompanied the excursion to Semaphore last Saturday for a three-day city visit.  They played at Gawler on the way and in front of the Town Hall at Semaphore on arrival, before going to Adelaide for breakfast at the Cheer-up Hut where they were entertained by Mrs Seager.  The Vice-President Mr G. McEwin entertained them for dinner at 1 p.m.  They gave a band concert at Semaphore at 3.30 p.m. after which the Semaphore Cheer-up Soc. gave them afternoon tea.

On Sunday at 2 p.m. Lieut. Col Russell, Chief Medical Officer at Keswick, arranged a charabanc from the GPO to Keswick Hospital where the Band entertained wounded soldiers, followed by afternoon tea and a tour of the hospital.

On Monday at noon the Mayoress of Adelaide Mrs C. Glover entertained the Band and Messrs Crewes & F. & E.J. Harris at morning tea at the Town Hall, after which they played a selection or two for the Mayoress in the Hall.  At 12.45 they marched to the recruiting meeting in front of Bowman’s Arcade, where they played several selections.  They were then entertained at the Cheer-up Hut before catching the train to Burra.

The Ladies’ band etc. welcomed Tpr H. Bowman & Pte Elliott at the Burra Station.
