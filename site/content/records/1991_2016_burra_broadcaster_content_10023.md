Obituary.  Ian Auhl 1914-96 (By Mary Woollacott.)

Ian Auhl died peacefully at his Burnside home on 22 March aged 81.  Burra has lost one of its greatest visionaries and most devoted sons.

Back in the mid-1960s Ian was Principal of Burra Primary School and his love of the area was apparent in his early writings, published in the Burra Record.  He drew attention to the wonderful and fascinating history of the town and its role in the destiny of South Australia.  It took Ian’s research, writing and verbal communications skills to bring the knowledge of Burra as a special place to life.  An early article was ‘The Girls of Hampton Court’.  He later produced a history of the Unicorn Brewery Cellars in ‘In Cellar Cool’ and a history of the Burra Model School for its centenary in 1977.  Last September he was proud to have the Local History Room at the Community Library named the ‘Auhl Local History Room’.  His masterpiece was of course ‘The Story of the Monster Mine’ – the result of intense labour and meticulous research.

Ian was born in Burra in [27 December 1914] and returned as the Primary School Principal fifty years later until the end of 1967.  Throughout his working life he taught at a number of places in SA before retiring due to ill health.

Despite writing books on several other places in the state, it was Burra that had a tenacious grip on his loyalties and he sometimes became a lone and even unpopular voice in his quest for the status he knew to be Burra’s natural right.  Saving Burra’s buildings and with them out heritage became his obsession.  To achieve this he enlisted the practical and moral help of other townspeople and the local National Trust Branch.

The Burra Conservation Study, which he undertook in 1978 drew many previously little known matters to the attention of those with the power to do something.  There were moments when his zeal must have been a thorn in the side of the Town and later the District Council – indeed right up to the end.  Today we have a well preserved, interesting and attractive town and much of the initial credit for this development goes to Ian Auhl’s determinism and perseverance over decades.

In 1979 he was awarded the OAM for his services to conservation, but his greatest reward was probably the proclamation by the Governor Dame Roma Mitchell of Burrs as one of the few heritage towns in the country, in February 1993.  Ian was the first to admit that much of Burra’s history has yet to be written and to that end he and Eva donated money to the Library’s Research Awards to help with further exploration of our rich past.
