The Holidays.

On Christmas Eve the town was decorated and crowds built steadily and an hour or so into the evening the footpaths were blocked and pedestrians had to take to the streets.  The whole district contributed to the throng.  The children created a great din with toy trumpets to the annoyance of ‘older ones who had forgotten childhood’s happy days’.  The better season this year has encouraged more festivity and more business for the shops.  Window displays were impressive.  The Burra band performed in front of various businesses before playing carols later in the night.  The Salvation Army took a position in Market Square and drew a big crowd.  Captain Swift gave the address along with others.  Hotels were decorated with green boughs and Chinese lanterns as were the shop verandahs.

Christmas Day was warm and windy and the churches full.  In the morning Rev. R.J. Daddow conducted a service at the Hospital with the Mayor and most Councillors present.

On Boxing Day the Salvation Army public tea was very successful followed by an open-air meeting and a musical battle.  Next Sunday the Army collection will go towards the Broken Hill Distress Fund as it will from every corps in Australia.
