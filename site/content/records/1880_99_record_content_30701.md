Cr O’Leary moved an amendment that acceptance depend on the Mayor paying the cost of the election, but he did not feel a further penalty should be applied.

Cr Sampson said such an undertaking had not been given in writing.

The Town Clerk said he would personally guarantee the cost of the election.

Cr Sampson then said the action showed the ignorance of the Mayor and proved that the affairs of the Council had been bungled as alleged at the ratepayers’ meeting.  The full penalty allowed by law should be imposed.

Cr O’Leary wanted to know on what authority Cr Rabbich relied for stating that Cr Sampson was the cause of the resignation.

Cr Rabbich referred to a conversation he had had with the Town Clerk, but was not very specific in his answer.  He felt the question of penalty must be left till afterwards.

The chairman ruled the amendment out of order as the fine could only be remitted on subsequent application.  The amendment was withdrawn.  Motion carried.

Nominations for the position of Mayor will close 24 December.

The election, if required, will be on 31 December.

Cr Sampson moved that the Town Clerk inform the Mayor of the condition of acceptance and that he might apply for remission of all or part of the fine if he thought fit.

The Town Clerk estimated the income for the year at c. £820.

There was a debt of £270, bonds of £200 and interest of £120 plus salaries and office expenses.  The health account had a debt of £80 and the parklands a credit of £50.
