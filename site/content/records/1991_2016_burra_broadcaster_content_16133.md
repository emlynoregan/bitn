Terowie Cemetery

The 1998 Clean Up Australia Day effort saw two trailer loads of rubbish, weeds, clippings etc. removed.  Since then Deryck Skinner has put in much effort to tidy the cemetery.  A number of descendants of early residents have indicated an interest in marking previously unmarked graves of relatives.  Albert Kloester has worked on behalf of a number of families to restore grave sites and to exterminate large colonies of aggressive ants on site.  Deryck and Sue Miller have undertaken to uniformly mark all presently unmarked graves.  John Aver Mitchell was the founder of Terowie.  He was a Scot born in 1832 and died in Terowie in 1879.  In March 1872 he purchased Section 158 in the Hundred of Terowie and built the Terowie Hotel on the edge of the Section.  He then had the rest of the Section (and later other areas) surveyed into town allotments.  Terowie CMC is setting up a fund to restore Mitchellâ€™s grave for the 120th anniversary of his death in 1999.
