Fire.  The Redruth Post Office and store was totally destroyed by fire at about 4 a.m. on 27 February.  It was occupied by Mr Martin Davey.  Mrs Davey and two girls were sleeping in a bedroom adjoining the shop and were awakened by the flames.  They ran outside and alerted neighbours, but assistance was useless.  The flames were spread rapidly by the high east wind.  No stock and not much else worth mentioning was saved.  The stock was insured and the building is also believed insured by another office.  All letters for delivery and those posted for transmission were destroyed along with post office sundries.
