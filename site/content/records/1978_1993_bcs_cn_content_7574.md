Paxton Square

Premier John Bannon will unveil a plaque and officially open the Paxton Square Redevelopment and Restoration Project at 11 a.m. on 8 April.  [Various other official guests are listed.]

After an inspection of the cottages there will be a luncheon at the Civic Centre.  The media have been invited and it is believed that Radio 5PI will broadcast live from the Square.  It is planned to promote the venture vigorously now that the Bridge Terrace row of units is ready for occupancy.  The $305,000 project has attracted interest Australia-wide.  The SA Mining Association first built the cottages in 1849 [1849-52].  The redevelopment has been carefully managed by architect Mr David Gilbert to retain the Square’s integrity and atmosphere as miners’ cottages.
