Burra Rural Youth held its AGM.  The retiring President Peter Jarvis said Burra Rural Youth had survived in an era when state-wide the organisation was in a slump and when in this area competition for the interest of young people has increased at the same time as the number of them has fallen.  The innovative program for the year met with mixed success.  Elected for 1986-87 were: President, Kym Earle; Secretary, David Hill and Treasurer, Jane Kellock.
