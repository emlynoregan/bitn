Institute Lecture Series.  On Tuesday 22 August Rev. R.S. Casely will lecture on Tennyson, illustrated by songs and a glee and a chorus using his poems.

Mr T.F. Robertson has started a parcel express between Kooringa and Redruth.  The express leaves Kooringa for the railway station at 11 and 2.30 and parcels between the north and south of the town are delivered at intervals.

Burra Literary Soc. continues successfully with prepared speeches next Friday.

Mr J. Rumball was relieved of his duties as stationmaster on Monday 3 July.

‘It is a week or two since the Commissioners wrote Mr Rumball requesting him to send in his resignation with a view of taking eight months leave of absence which he is entitled to under the regulations of the South Australian Railways.  There has as yet been no reply to the requisition from a large number of townspeople that Mr Rumball keep his position.  Mr Keitch will take his place, but no one can permanently be appointed till Mr Rumball’s leave of absence expires, and whether he will continue in service remains to be seen.’

Major W.T. Hoskin (Salvation Army) writes about his arranging the 3rd annual meeting of the social wing in SA at the Adelaide Town Hall on 21 August.  Chief Justice Way will preside.  There is an appeal for funds on behalf of rescue.  The work covers: Prison Gate Brigade, Rescued Sisters’ Home, Maternity Home, Police Court Visitation, Samaritan & Enquiry Department and Servant’s Registry.

Burra School Board of Advice visited Booborowie and Leighton schools on 29 July.  At Booborowie Miss Murphy had 26 out of 32 present and they acquitted themselves well.  Mr Otto Junge at Leighton has been transferred to Nuriootpa after three years.  20 out of 32 were present.  Miss Fuller is soon to take over.

Mr Henry Taylor’s lecture on Why we are Poor or Why Farming Doesn’t Pay was delivered at the Institute on Friday to a small group as the weather was very poor.
