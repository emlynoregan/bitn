Burra Town Council, ordinary monthly meeting last Monday.

Council is to get an estimate of the cost of electric lighting for the town.

The Municipal Assoc. advises the Council it can make by-laws to regulate motor traffic and can issue licences for motorcars to ply for hire.

The Railway Commissioner will place an electric gong at the Bon Accord crossing.

Thomas Tiver (Aberdeen) draws attention to the deplorable state of Sandford St.

[Since there is no Sandford St, this may be an error for Sancreed St.]

John Harvey has withdrawn his resignation as dayman.  Accepted.

The Deputy Postmaster General advises that mail will be sent by the Broken Hill express from 19 May.

Newton McLaren & Co. advise that the scattered nature of the town will make lighting it more expensive than would otherwise be the case.
