G.A. Ridgway writes re the Burra Burra Copper Co. and the continuing inaction of the directors.  All they seem to have done is hold their half-yearly meeting, and protect their fees.  Having slept a good while they will wake up at the end of this month to ‘draw another half-year’s screw’.  When are they going to spend the £5,000 they have in the bank?  When is the Snow Co. going to start operations?  Everything was going to be in full swing by 13 July.
