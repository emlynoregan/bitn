Burra Show Society is planning a number of additional displays because this yearâ€™s show will be the 100th* staged by the society.  At the AGM last week Mr Ron Shipard was elected President. Following the resignation of Mr Daniel Field as Secretary the position was filled at special meeting on the Monday following and Mrs Bob Jamieson is the new secretary.

[*This is wildly inaccurate. The first Show was held in 1877, but there were no shows from 1886 to 1893, apparently due to apathy, which provoked considerable comment in the local paper at the time.  The 1897 Show was cancelled due to the appallingly bad season and the 1914 Show was cancelled due to the combined effects of the outbreak of World War I and a devastating drought.  (The event returned in 1915.)  Twenty-five years of Shows from 1915-39 ended in 1940 when the Show was cancelled due to World War II.  The Show remained suspended until 1946, since when it has been an annual event. This makes the 1977 show the 85th.]
