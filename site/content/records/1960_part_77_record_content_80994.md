Burra Mine

The Burra community became worried when the Poseidon receiver and manager Mr Buckley and Professor Rudd visited the town and inspected the Mine.  The business people and the town generally grew concerned and telegrams were sent to the Premier, the Minister of Mines and the Leader of the Opposition.  Professor Rudd says the Mine is presently operating with a small profit and it is not intended to close it.  But we all know that if the price of copper drops much more it could cause the Mine’s closure.  At present the Mine employs 62 people and when in full production, 100.  Samin owns several houses in the town.  In Parliament the Hon. Hugh Hudson said that discussions with Samin had been going on for some time and would be continued with the receiver.  Poseidon, Samin’s parent company is in difficulty and if Samin needed cash to sustain a period of insufficiency there would be a problem.  The difficulty is greater for Burra because it produces a specialty product for which appropriate markets had to be developed.  The Government certainly wishes to keep the Burra Mine going if it can reasonably be achieved, but it cannot support an operation if it is likely to continue to be unprofitable.  There are hopes the copper price will recover by the end of June and hopefully the Government will be able to reach an agreement with the receiver to ensure the Mine can continue so that the market can be tested.  We cannot, however, say with any certainty that this will be achieved.
