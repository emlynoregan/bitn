Mobile Kitchen Destroyed by Fire.

A party comprising Gordon Wooton, Stan Beinke, Jimmie Taylor, Trevor Baker, Bob Taylor and Jack Stannard are part of a Highway’s Department gang road making 100 miles north of Yunta.  On Tuesday last week, with temperature about 118°F they were transferring the camp and machinery from Wertaloona to Curnamona.  The 18 ft x 20 ft [sic:!] caravan kitchen, which accommodated twelve men at meal times, caught fire about four miles south of Frome Downs.  The ‘train’ of vehicles was turned into the wind and an attempt was made to extinguish the fire, but all that could be saved of the kitchen was the bottled gas container.  The truck and smaller van were not damaged, but all the food, furniture and utensils were lost.  The cook, Jack Stannard, lost a deal of personal belongings.  The roads in these areas of drift sand and watercourses will enable large numbers of cattle to be transported from the northern areas to Frome Downs by road.  Temperatures like Tuesday’s have been experienced for a week and for the preceding four days a severe dust storm had raged.
