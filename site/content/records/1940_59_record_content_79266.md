Burra Show 1957

The 1957 Show drew record entries and gate takings.  It was opened by Mr Ewen Waterman, the Commonwealth Wool Adviser.  He said that as the centre of the Stud Merino Sheep Breeding Industry, Burra was one of the world’s important places.

Early on Saturday it was windy, but it settled to be perfect weather for the show.

Gate takings were £245 plus £40 for the dance in the evening.

Side shows were fairly numerous with the boxing show, the merry-go-round and the horse ride the most popular.

Industrial stands were somewhat less numerous, but there were good displays of modern machinery, motor vehicles and household appliances.

Rural Youth put in a float that was most effective.

The display of schoolwork was commendable.

In the Art Section Mrs V. Ockenden took most prizes and in the Juvenile Section Maurice Perry took the special prize on points.  R. Jennison had the best colour transparency.

Cattle numbers were small.  M.C. Garrard had the Champion Jersey Cow and Bull.  John Parker exhibited the Champion Bull, truest to breed.

A. Tennant took most prizes in the AIS Section.

Mrs F.C .Stolte took the aggregate prize in cookery.

Champion Dog of Shoe was J.G. Smallacombe’s Kelpie Bitch.

Best exhibit in Floral Art went to C. Lamb’s bowl of Iceland poppies.

C.R. Simon took the trophy in Grain & Fodder.
