World’s End Methodist Church celebrated its 50th anniversary last Sunday.  The church was built in 1887in the ministry of the late Rev. H.T. Burgess and the foundation stone was laid by the late Mrs Thomas Drew then of Kooringa and mother of Mr John Drew Sen. of Kooringa.  The building carries its age well.  Rev. Secombe officiated.  [The half-column report does not explain why 1939 is 50 years after 1887.]
