Cr Ridgway said the staff was two troopers, one foot constable and one sergeant at a cost of c. £600 p.a.  He thought a foot constable could replace the sergeant at Kooringa and the foot constable at Redruth could be dispensed with which would save c. £70 p.a.  This advice will be passed on to the Government.
