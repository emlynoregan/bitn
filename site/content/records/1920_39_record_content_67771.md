Railway Accident.  As the Broken Hill express approached Burra on Tuesday morning it was nearing the curve at the Bon Accord Hotel when an axle on one of the back wheels of the third coach (a centenary corridor car) broke.  The coach came off the line and dragged a second class coach and guard’s van with it.  The train continued to the station where the misaligned coach struck the platform coping with a terrific crash, greatly damaging the coach and the platform.  It is amazing that the coaches were not more damaged or any passenger injured.  They had ploughed their way down the track for about 500 yards, tearing up lines, sleepers and points and smashing them into the undercarriages.  Lines were cut in halves.  Passengers were shaken, but there were no serious injuries.  The train was delayed less than an hour and continued with the two front coaches and a guard’s van.  The line was speedily cleared for traffic.
