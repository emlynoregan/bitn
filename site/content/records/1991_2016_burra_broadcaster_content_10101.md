The Editor reprints part of an editorial from Issue 208 of 27 March 1995 about the long delay in getting an industrial zone for Burra.  The editorial suggested it could be time to dismiss consultants Bone & Tonkin.

He then went on to say that it took almost another year of inactivity before the consultants were sacked.  Thus two years had passed with still no move towards the development of an industrial zone.  He said demand could expect to increase with the sealing of the Burra-Morgan Road.
