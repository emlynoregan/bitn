The Half-Yearly Report

The amount of the land purchase and preliminary expenses paid out of the Company’s paid up capital (£14,800) was £13,874-12-6.  Working cost, management and incidental expenses have amounted to £3,087-3-3.  These expenses have been met by the shipment of ore to the extent of £1,971-5-8.  It is likely returns yet to come on ore shipped and at grass will produce a surplus of about 10% upon the capital.  Ore shipped is about 193 tons, leaving about 113 tons at the Port and the mine.
