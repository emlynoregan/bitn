Ulooloo Diggings.  Mr Simmons the storekeeper has taken three fine specimens of gold to Burra.  The largest was a little more than 13 oz troy.  It was found about two miles from Ulooloo Creek and one and a half miles from the head of Coglin’s Gully by a German digger washing material there.  It is nearly all pure gold.  The second specimen of about 2 oz of gold is more mixed with ironstone.  A ¾ oz nugget is almost pure gold, but very rough.  It is as well to record that not much gold is being found generally by other workers.
