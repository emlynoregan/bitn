Mrs Drinkwater, now living in the UK and aged 85 visited Burra recently and went to the Commercial Hotel where she was born.  She came to Australia by boat with her two daughters, on a two month holiday.  Her maiden name was Kennedy and her father was a school teacher in Burra for about three years.  A school house was being built in Kangaroo Street, but it was not ready in time, so the family stayed at the Commercial Hotel.  Her sister was seven and tempted sorely by the stairway banister of the first two storey building she had seen.  She slid down the rail, but at the turn half-way down she fell and broke her shoulder.  The doctor was called and confirmed the break, but said he must first attend to her mother, whom he took into Room 1 and delivered a baby girl – now Mrs Drinkwater – on 16 January 1893.  She took the opportunity of a look at room No. 1.
