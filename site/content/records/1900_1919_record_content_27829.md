Obituary.  Mrs Jane Harvey, an old resident of Burra died in the Adelaide Hospital last week after a short illness.  She was the mother of Mrs John Peak of Hanson and Mrs W.E. Jordan of Kooringa.

[This report seems to me to be wrong, though checking the background is not straightforward.  Mrs Margaret Harvey died 23 October 1910 and was buried in Burra Cemetery 24 October 1910.  Both sources say she was 74.  Death registration however, gives the place of death and residence as Kooringa.  The age suggests a birth c. 1836.  Her marriage to John Harvey in 1865 suggests a birth date c. 1839.  She does though, seem to be the mother of Mesdames Peak and Jordan.]
