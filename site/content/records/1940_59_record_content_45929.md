[Given that the other streets in the area have Cornish names Merthyr should probably be Merther after the place in Cornwall, but in any case the street appears usually as Helen Terrace.  The confusion arises from whether it is viewed as the most westerly street in Redruth or the most easterly in Aberdeen.]
