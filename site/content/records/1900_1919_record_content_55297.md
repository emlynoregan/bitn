Burra Hospital Board.

Residents have been complaining of a bad smell from the hospital drainage and steps had been taken to remedy it.

Patient numbers for May were c. 4.

The Staff comprised Matron, a not-yet-qualified nurse, 3 probationers, a laundress, a cook, a wards-maid and a porter.

Mr Crewes doubted that this reflected efficiency.

Mr Warnes said the hospital was equipped for 30 and had to be maintained in case of an outbreak of disease.

Mr Crewes wondered if a special nurse for isolation was warranted under the circumstances.

The Chairman said that with no charge-nurse it was necessary.

Mr Crewes: but in spite of the numbers we are trying to get a charge-nurse at £80 p.a.  He moved that the cost of the upkeep of the institution be considered.

Mr Warnes said the 3 probationers got 32/6 a month, so could hardly be reduced in pay or numbers.  The Matron and porter got £100 p.a. each, which was little enough.  The trouble was the shortage of patients.

Dr Williams was to be complimented on the work he had done to keep serious operations coming in.  If townspeople were not going to support the hospital possibly the doors would be closed.  Mr Warnes denied any extravagance.

Mr Radford said that without a charge-nurse the Matron was on duty practically 24 hours a day, as there was no other qualified nurse.  She could not be asked to continue on those lines.

One probationer wanted to leave.

The Chairman said in his opinion if the townspeople did not support the hospital it must be closed.  Some had gone to Adelaide, told a tale of woe and been admitted as paupers.  As a result of such abuse Adelaide hospitals were full.  The Inspector-General intended to force such people to be treated locally unless a very good reason could be shown.
