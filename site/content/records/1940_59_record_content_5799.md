Letter.  Mr Lel. Kellaway writes re the Burra Mine.

He cites a report published in the Mines of South Australia, 1908.

The report says the mine is located 100 miles north of Adelaide and the deposit was found in 1845 by a shepherd named Pickett.  The ores obtained have been largely red oxides, very rich blue and green carbonates, including malachite, and also native copper.  The mine at one time supported a large population.  The capital investment was £12,320 in £5 shares and no subsequent call was ever made on investors.  The total amount paid in dividends was £800,000.  After being worked for some time by the original investors, the mine was later sold to a new company, but for the last few years has not been worked.  For many years the average yield was from 10,000 to 13,000 tons of ore averaging 22 to 23% copper.  The company spent £2,241,157 in general expenses and the output was 234,648 tons, equivalent to 51,622 tons of copper.  At the average price of copper this amounted in money value to £4,749,224.  The mine ceased working in 1877.  In 1859 the number of men employed was 1,170.

[The report then describes the ore bodies of the original mine.]

Using old plans the Government Geologist determined to put the [recent] Diamond Drill bore down with the object of striking Sander’s or Kingston’s lodes at a depth on the inclination.  The bore reached a depth of 1,004 ft and entered a brecciated lode formation at 780ft.  At 813 ft copper pyrites and quartz were observed and continued for many feet.  Similar lode formation continued to the bottom of the bore hole.  This shows that copper bearing lodes as mentioned in the last report of the Mine Management as existing at 600 ft in Morphett’s Shaft, as well as Waterhouse and Peacock’s continue for 200 ft deeper than had been proved in Morphett’s Shaft.  The geologist was of the opinion that data collected justified putting Morphett’s Shaft in order and restarting mining operations at that point.  A second bore site has been selected near the south end of the old open cut.  In 1899 mining operations were resumed on a small scale and an ore body was discovered a short distance to the SW of the original explorations.  Gall’s Shaft was started further west in more solid country and sunk to 75 ft.  At 60 ft a crosscut struck the ore body, which at 8 ft from the shaft was found to be about 10 ft wide and to comprise mostly blue and green carbonates and some bornite.  Further testing should continue.  [The report is dated 30 March 1904. And Mr Kellaway clearly considers that it should be brought to the attention of wartime authorities, with the intention that mining be resumed.]
