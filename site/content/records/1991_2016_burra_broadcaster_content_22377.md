The Burra Ecumenical Group: Connexions is bringing the four piece band Innhaus Fish to Burra Community School on 5 June.  The band offers a way to explore faith with music, fun and laughter.  Their theological stance is that the Kingdom of God is a party and therefore they need to be a party band.  They will be part of an ecumenical service in Burra on 4 June at 11 a.m. at the Uniting Church.
