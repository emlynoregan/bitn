Letter.  Stephen Angel & Wendy Burge write re the Baby Care Room.  People are understandably looking for action after more than a year, when goods and funds have been donated towards its establishment.  Progress is occurring, but more slowly than anticipated.  Plans have been drawn up, costed and approved.  Negotiations re National Trust lease arrangements should soon be concluded.  A tentative suggestion of an alternative site may cause another brief delay.
