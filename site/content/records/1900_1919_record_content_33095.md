Ratepayer’s Meeting.  Ex-councillor Hardy took the chair.

The Mayor’s Report.

The year has seen prosperity generally.  Telephones were extended to several business places and public institutions.  The Governor, Sir Day Bosanquet, inspected the Girls’ Reformatory and the school, the hospital and the ballast quarry.  Burra Corporation Band received generous aid from the door money from South Booborowie Land Sales, Thanks to Mr Tom Brown, [check Browne?] attorney to Mr Browne.

All wards ended the year in credit and the general account should end c. £50 in credit.  The present rates are: General 1/-, Health 10d and Parklands 2d.

The Cemetery.

The account is £137 in credit, but next year considerable cost will be involved in extending boundaries.

Health Report.

For the year there were 13 cases of diphtheria, 8 of tuberculosis, 40 of measles, 3 of typhoid and 3 of erysipelas.  The measles & diphtheria coincided with statewide outbreaks.  The Board of Health started with a debit of £94-19-8, but with no serious outbreaks of disease we have reduced the debt to £6-15-0.

Parklands.

A strong fence was placed around Victoria Park Oval.

New plantations were fenced in Commercial St and planted with pines etc.

The Council desires to plant an avenue of pines or other trees at each entrance to the town.  We hope to achieve this in 1913.

Saleyards.

As the largest market for stock in SA outside Adelaide we saw for the year about 130,000 sheep and 3,000 cattle sold.  Sales of horses were much less, but rising.  Though the total sheep numbers are less than in the past, prices are up.

Railway.

In the past year at the Hanson station c. 147,000 bushels of wheat and 29 tons of wool were despatched.

At Burra station:

c. 119,000 bushels of wheat, 5,002 bales of wool, 51,425 sheep, 1,271 cattle, 319 horses and 38 pigs were despatched.  11,295 passengers arrived and 11,572 passengers departed.
