D.D. reports on The Gold Diggings, writing from Melbourne 7 April 1852.

The Gold Escort to Melbourne delivered yesterday 12,873 oz from Mt Alexander and 935 oz from Ballarat.

It is thought most gold comes by Escort as the road is too unsafe for diggers to carry it themselves.

The influx of bad characters, especially from Van Diemen’s Land, has made robberies and murders common.

It is estimated that there are 50,000 at the diggings.  Calculations suggest that the gold produced represents an average income per digger of only 10/6 per week.

Fears are expressed that there will be a great number of deaths when winter sets in as very few diggers are housed in huts to resist the wet and cold.

[The article discusses other aspects of the impact of gold on Melbourne and describes the robbery of the Nelson, in which thieves took some £25,000 worth of gold.]
