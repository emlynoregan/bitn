Kingston St Bridge. The new bridge at Kooringa by Mr Morris, Road Board Engineer, was passed over yesterday and is now open to traffic. There is talk of a formal opening later.

The bridge cost £2,500 and consists of two 60' spans with a centre pier of two cast iron cylinders which are sunk 12' into the bed of the creek. Mr Purchas has been charge of the erection and Mr Davis of Adelaide was the contractor for the ironwork.
