Rabbits.  Never have they been as numerous as now.  They can be seen in their thousands and in places there are heaps of dead rabbits piled up from weakness and poison.  For miles along the eastern road the stench is almost unbearable.  They are seen in droves towards Ketchowla and even in the town some fences have been the site for 100 to 300 to be killed in an hour or so.
