Burra Mine

Developmental work continues under Mr J.S. Pryor.  Work is concentrated at Gall’s & Peacock’s air shafts.  Good ore is being won from a winze at Gall’s sunk on the western lode 10 or 12ft from the old workings (green & blue carbonates of copper).  At 115ft level on the western lode a drive has been extended 70ft through ground with indications of the proximity of a rich sulphide body.  A crosscut has been extended from Gall’s shaft into old workings and the main drive secured to Peacock’s sir shaft.  A large body of milling ore is exposed for over 80ft along the drive.  Crosscuts show the lode to be fully 20ft wide.  The drive from Peacock’s air shaft northwest shows blue and green carbonates, cuprite and rich malachite ore.  A crosscut from the open cut near Penny’s shaft easterly to intersect Tinline’s lode entered the lode at 110ft.  A drive has been extended along the course of lode for 180ft south and 120ft north and small deposits of rich ore have been encountered.

The mine looks exceedingly well and the company are contemplating putting in a concentrating plant to treat ore and hopes are good for further development and capital input.
