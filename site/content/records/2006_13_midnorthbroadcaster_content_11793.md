Roaring 40s Waterloo Wind Farm will be opened by Premier Rann on Thursday 17 February.  The farm has 37 turbines dotted across the 18 km site.  This will give the company four operating wind farms in SA & Tasmania.  The managing director Steve Symons said the Waterloo Wind Farm will produce enough green energy to power 46,000 homes over 20 years.  The towers were made in SA and the company has also given more than $65,000 to local community groups and over $2.4 million for local council road upgrading and maintenance.

A New Anti Wind Farm Group has been established: ‘Stop Industrial Wind Turbines’.

It will seek to inform people of issues surrounding turbines and calls for greater transparency about energy production.
