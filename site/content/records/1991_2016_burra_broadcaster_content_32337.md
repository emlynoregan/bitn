SA Museum’s Outback Road Show came to BCS Gymnasium on Thursday 23 October.  Students were able to handle meteorites and space objects, excavate fossils from dirt-filled containers and locals could meet and talk with visiting scientists.  There was also the opportunity to visit a dig site at Redbanks.  [5 photos]
