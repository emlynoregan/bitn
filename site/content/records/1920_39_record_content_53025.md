Cricket at Mongolata must have been an unusual game given the weather conditions as well as the rather casual attitude of the players at the best of times.  It was played in heavy rain showers with batsmen nearly blinded by a hailstorm at one stage.  Cec. Opieâ€™s Team 43 & 3 for 53 defeated Mongolata 16 & 69.
