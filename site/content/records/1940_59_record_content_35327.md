The Gorge water reserve is reported to have been leased by the Robertstown DC to a sheep owner for grazing purposes.  This reserve has been an outstanding beauty spot and picnic ground for generations of Burra and district people.  There are a number of swimming holes in the creek and tennis courts have been built close by.  If the Council persists in its action to lease the area, The Gorge will be ruined as a picnic ground.  The lease could at any time prohibit the use of the picnic ground and stop people swimming in the pools.  He could probably close the tennis courts too.  If sheep roam over the area the earth will become powdered and the slightest wind will raise dust and the banks of the creek will become crisscrossed with sheep tracks and assume the appearance of the banks of a dam.  World’s End people have deputed Ern Phillips to wait on the Robertstown Council to object to the change.

The intention to lease has to be advertised in a local paper and the Government Gazette.  We can find no such advertisement.
