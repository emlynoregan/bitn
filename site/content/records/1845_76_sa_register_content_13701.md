Return of Mr Stuart

Mr Stuart has returned from his epic trip to the northern interior, as stated by us yesterday.  We received news of this from a correspondent in the north on Wednesday evening and on Thursday the following extract of a letter from Mr Goyder, the Assistant Surveyor-General was read in both Houses of the Legislature:

‘Chamber’s Creek, September 13, 1860,

Mr Stuart left here today for the south.  He and his party are ill with scurvy.  They have been to lat. 18°47’, long. 134°, when they were compelled to return, the party being unable to cope with natives who attacked them.’

The point reached was about 1,100 miles beyond the settled districts and more than 500 miles beyond the western boundary of the colony.  It nearly completes the track across the continent to the point reached by Mr Gregory from the northern side, down the course of the Victoria River.  Mr Stuart was not prepared to contend with a strong body of natives, as his party consisted only of himself and two men.  Mr Stuart may be expected in Adelaide in a few days.
