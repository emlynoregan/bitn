Elders have been a part of Burra for nearly 100 years.  Their first modest office was at the rear of Drew & Crewes store, next door to their later office that is now the Burra tourist Information Centre.  The two storey premises were built in 1891 and vacated in the 1960s when Elder Smith and Goldsbrough Mort merged.  In 1887 the commission on livestock was a flat rate of 6.5% and in 1890 Elders at Burra sold 204,898 sheep.  Records also show that up to 1892 the total number of sheep sold by agents in Burra exceeded half a million annually.  In 1906 a ‘hi-tech’ piece of office equipment was introduced; a typewriter.  In 1904* the office acquired its first motor vehicle.  Horses and buggies were also retained till 1917.  Elders have now relocated to refurbished premises formerly those of Jennison Ford.  This move provides more space, a large range of stock and easier access.

[* It is interesting that the local paper did not record the arrival of this vehicle.  Cars were first reported in the town in 1905 when they were a rare novelty that scared the horses.]
