Pextons

Most people in the district will remember the Pextons who worked a gold claim at Mongolata some years ago and they will recall the brothers Pexton having some success with gold.  When the gold ran out they quit and purchased land, first in WA and later in the South East of SA.  The ‘Naracoorte Herald’ reports that Mr Ron Pexton is making a real success of his venture with a dairy herd.  He had much success at the recent Naracoorte Show with his Jersey Bull Takati-Inkunzi, which won first prize in the aged class and first prize in all aged classes and it was only narrowly edged into second place at the Mt Gambier Show with competition from Victoria.
