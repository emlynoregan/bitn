Essington Lewis (Reprinted from the Melbourne Sun.)

Mr Essington Lewis is the new Director General of Aircraft Production and Director General of Munitions.  He is the son of the late John Lewis who arrived at Darwin in 1872 [Numbers indistinct] having been journeying between the northern and southern ends of the Overland Telegraph before it was completed.  A few months earlier two African explorers had set out to explore the country between Darwin and Pt Essington and had been lost.  John Lewis was asked to investigate and after being attacked by natives was able to establish that the list explorers had been murdered by a tribe.  He determined to establish a station near the site of the old military establishment at Port Essington, but after a stern struggle he was forced to admit defeat.  It must have been memories of that place that impelled him to instruct the Minister at St Mary’s Church in January 1881 to christen his baby son with the name Essington.
