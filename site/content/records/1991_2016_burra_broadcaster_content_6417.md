Letter.  Des Woolley writes at some length, suggesting that the long list of candidates for Council suggests a general dissatisfaction with that body and he also suggests:

There are too many restrictions and rules (laid down by an absentee body)

Too much Council money is expended on so-called expert advisors and consultants

Too many take-away food shops, antique shops and Bed & Breakfast places in Burra, but nowhere locally to buy clothes and shoes

Council is failing to address the basic problems of the area

So vote and vote thoughtfully with the above in mind.
