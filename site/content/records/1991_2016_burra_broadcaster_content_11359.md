Search at Sturt Vale

Police attended an abandoned car at Sturt Vale Station last Friday.  It was found with two flat tyres and a distressed dog in it.  They took the dog to Burra at 10 p.m.  Meanwhile Nuriootpa Police had ascertained that Mrs June Moesing (58), the wife of the carâ€™s owner, had left home at 1 p.m. on Thursday.  A search was then organised to begin at first light.  SES units from Adelaide, Pt Pirie, Burra, Hallett, Spalding and Laura participated along with CFS units from Riverland, Baldina, Burra & the Eastern Districts.  They were joined by two helicopters and the Burra Ambulance was on standby.  Conditions were difficult due to rain making the roads slippery.  The search continued on Sunday, when the dog was returned to the car and soon set off down the road.  At 7.40 a.m. the woman was found alongside the road, suffering from exposure and dehydration.  She was transferred to Burra Hospital.  Burra Police officer Henderson praised the efforts of all involved in the search.
