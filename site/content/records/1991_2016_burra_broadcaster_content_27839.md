The Heysen Trail is being re-routed to avoid Princess Royal Station and ‘The Gap’ south of Burra, following a series of events leading to landowners stopping walkers from crossing their properties.  As a temporary measure walkers can follow the old Adelaide Road.  A new route is being planned by section maintenance leader Hugh Greenhill.

Some people have been walking out of season during fire ban periods and others have been leaving the trail and creating a nuisance.  David Gebhardt told police of walkers with two large dogs travelling through and then of finding 18 sheep dead a week later from what appeared to be dog attacks, some 300 m from the trail.  Walkers have also been leaving the trail and interfering with farm buildings.  Simon Rowe, owner of Princess Royal, also complains of a lot of people entering Princess Royal from Burra Creek Gorge, which is not part of the Heysen Trail.  Owners are bothered by people wishing to ride motor cycles through their property and are also concerned about public liability considerations.  Mr Greenhill said that in 20 years this was the most serious problem they had had in running the Heysen Trail.  He was sure solutions would be found that would suit landowners and walkers.  This year is the Year of the Outback, which has seen increased numbers of walkers on both the Heysen and Mawson Trails.  The trail was extensively surveyed along the length of its course from the tip of Fleurieu Peninsula to the Upper Flinders Ranges in 2000.  The State Government hold public liability insurance for landowners traversed by the trail for 500 m either side of the trail.  The police at Burra have reports of disturbances at Burra Creek Gorge camping area recently involving reckless motor cycle riding and the trashing on a nearby unoccupied farmhouse.  The Gorge is crown land controlled by Goyder Council.
