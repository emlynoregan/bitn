Burglary.  Mr F. Spencer discovered a smashed cash register on the reserve at the rear of the Fire Station on Friday morning.  He contacted M-C Robinson and they found that Stan Field’s sweet shop had been broken into.  Mr Field found the cash register had been taken and a show case broken and cigarettes etc. removed.  Matthew’s Emporium had also been entered, but nothing taken.  It was later learned that it had been entered in mistake for Mr Field’s.  Charles Parks’ shop had also been entered and petty cash to 10/- in silver and copper had been taken.  The location of Parks’ shop so close to the police station suggested that the burglar was not local.  A young fellow was seen around Kooringa on Thursday afternoon in rather unusual dress for such a warm day.  On Friday morning the youth named Bowd was located at the Kooringa Hotel.  It seems he had escaped from Magill Boys’ Reformatory on 31 January by smashing a window and dropping 20ft to the ground.  He stole a suit from the Old Folks Home at Magill and an overcoat, cap, jewellery and some money from a North Adelaide house and on Wednesday an automatic pistol from a house in Enfield.  He got a lift as far as Burra on Thursday on a lorry bound for Broken Hill.  He looked around Stan Field’s shop and rested in the Mortuary Chapel at the cemetery where he was seen about 7 p.m.  He said there were 32 charges against him when he went to the Reformatory.  He had been educated at St Peter’s College, but owing to his behaviour his parents had disowned him.  He is now proud to have become a full blown criminal.  He was charged with the theft of £12-4-2 from W. Stanley Field, three tins of cigarettes and three packets of cigars.  He admitted the burglaries.  He also pleaded guilty to a charge of entering Mr Matthews’ shop and entering Mr Parks’ shop and stealing 10/-.  He was remanded to Adelaide for sentence.  He was also charged with being in possession of an unregistered pistol and fined £20 or 3 months.  His age was given over the wireless as 17, but he said he had given the Reformatory the wrong year of birth.
