Bertram Wellesley Pearse

(Reprinted from the Western Morning News, Plymouth England.)

The old and interesting Church of St Mary the Virgin at Holne on the fringe of Dartmoor was carefully restored some four years ago by a former vicar, the Rev. W.H. Harvey-Royse RN.  Now it has an addition to its many beauties.  The small chapel to the south of the chancel has been furnished as a memorial to one of Australia’s heroes who died from wounds received at Gallipoli.  The memorial comprises an altar of English oak with its oak ornaments, surmounted by a dorsal* and surrounded by oak panelling.  It is noticeable on the south side that an opening has been left in the panelling preserving the shape and size of the original piscina† in the wall of the chapel.  In the central panel above this is the following inscription:

‘To the Glory of god and in loving memory of Bertram Wellesley Pearse of the Burra Burra 3rd Light Horse wounded at Gallipoli, died May 25 1915 aged 34 years, leaving a widow and daughter to mourn his loss.  Buried at Malta.  Eldest son of T.H. & E.E. Pearse of the Gums Station, South Australia, by whom this memorial was given October 1924.’

Despite inclement weather a large congregation assembled for the service of dedication followed by a shortened evensong.  The Bishop of Crediton accompanied by other clergy asked Mr Pearse the donor to unveil the memorial.  This is one of the oldest portions of the church.  When the patronage fell into the hands of the Hospitallers of St John in 1329 this chapel was dedicated to St John.  The nave and aisles were rebuilt about a century later.  Mr Pearse is a former parishioner who has spent the last 46 years in Australia and has had wide experience as a sheep farmer.  He has been visiting the Motherland for the British Empire Exhibition.

[*More commonly a dossal or dossel: an ornamental hanging above an altar etc.

†A piscina is a perforated basin for carrying away ablutions and was traditionally found on the south side of the altar.]
