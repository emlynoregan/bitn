BCS Advanced Riding Course.  Three photos.

D.T. Wedding of Booborowie responds to the Burra Burra DC on assessment values.  He points out that with assessments increasing between 100 and 500% - if the Council considers that equitable – then the minimum statutory rate of 0.5c in the dollar will return much more than previously.  So much for rates not rising significantly.  There is some room for adjustment in the town rate, but not so with rural assessment.  Not only will rural landowners be ‘shot at’ they will be ‘hit’ if the assessments are not adjusted to be more in line with actual values.
