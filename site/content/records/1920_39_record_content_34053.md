Burra Athletic Club.  This is a recent formation.  It seems hard to keep an athletic club going in Burra, but we hope this effort breaks the rule.  Elected: Patron, J.R. Barker; President S.S. Dowling; Hon. Secretary, N. Drummond.  The first meeting was at Victoria Park on 12 April.  Misty rain rather spoilt the occasion and kept spectators away, but more came in the afternoon and c. Â£7 was collected on a 7d admission.  [240 people.]  Results are printed.
