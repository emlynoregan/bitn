Tony Ryan will be guest speaker at an assembly at BCS on 10 June.  A month ago Tony was inducted into the Shearersâ€™ Hall of Fame in Hay, NSW.  To mark the occasion some students under the direction of Roger Boehm and some members of the community made a striking sculpture of a shearer, which Roger then took to Hay for the induction.  Tony began shearing in 1943 at Middlebank Station near Broken Hill and he continued shearing and contracting around South Australia for the next twenty years.  In 1963 he became a shearing instructor in Sa Department of Agriculture, spending the next 22 years instructing young shearers in shearing skills, fitness and the repair and maintenance of shearing equipment.  He was also active in industrial relations issues and law and in occupational health and safety.  He eventually joined the Australian Wool Board (later the Australian Wool Corporation).
