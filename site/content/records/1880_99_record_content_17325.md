This is causing problems.  In its favour it is a boon to be able to the city earlier and to the Peninsula in one day.  But the disadvantages are: -

1.	The first train from Adelaide leaves so late it delays all morning mail for businesses.

2.	The last train from the north is too early for business hours.

The editor offers a solution in adjusting timetables, but says that speeding up the train would be another answer.  This could easily be done by checking tickets faster or less often - or by running corridor carriages instead of side-loaders so that tickets could be checked while the train is in motion.
