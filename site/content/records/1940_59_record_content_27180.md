Burra Town Ratepayers’ Meeting, Monday 24 June

Mr R.J. Jeffery chaired the meeting.

The Mayor’s Report

The town’s roads and bridges were in a satisfactory state.

The Council had taken over the Burra Institute and had spent about £200 on repairs and renovation, despite which the debt (other than the mortgage) was very small.

Goldsbrough Mort & Co. had given the Council a piece of land near the school, which would be turned into a playing field for the High School.

Town lighting had improved a lot following the lifting of wartime restrictions.

Burra Centenary Celebrations had been a success and Victory Celebrations had been held at appropriate times and every ex-serviceman and woman had received a farewell and welcome home.

He regretted that the clothing factory had been closed down due to the proprietor’s dissatisfaction with available labour.  This was a loss of £100 a week in wages to the town.

A 1939 proposal for an Old Folks Home in Burra had been shelved because of the war.

Civic welcomes had been extended to various prominent visitors and to 800 Canadians who had passed through and he had also welcomed NSW and Victorian Works Committees and SA Police Force Bands.

After waiting on the Premier the latter had promised a residence for the headmaster of Burra High School as soon as possible.

In 1940 there had been 35 empty houses in Burra.  He had launched a campaign to fill them with people from the city.  All told 75 families had been brought to Burra and he claimed that as a result property values had increased 35 to 50% and £400 extra per week was circulating in the town.  At present there were applications for 20 houses in Burra.

He praised the support the town had received from the Premier (Hon. T. Playford), Hon. A.L. McEwin, Mr A.E. Smith MHR and Mr A.D. McDonald MP, Mr E. Finch as Chairman of the Burra Burra Dc and the ‘Burra Record’ as well as all Councillors for their support.

Cr Kellaway endorsed the remarks and said that ratepayers should take into account the difficulties the Council had during the war, despite which they had surmounted all problems without penalising the ratepayers.

Cr Carpenter said that the £1,700 collected in rates was not much upon which to run a town like Burra, but the Council was financially very sound.  The Mayor, he said, had done an excellent job, but sixteen years in office was too long for any one man and it reflected the lack of interest locals took in town affairs.  His Worship had also done a good job at Mongolata in the time of the Depression.

Cr Lee expressed his support and Councillor H.J. B. Jennison also praised Mr Woollacott.

Mr Jennison saw the biggest challenge as the returning servicemen who would be seeking homes and employment, without which they would be lost to the city.  If people wanted better amenities paying more in rates was the only way Council could spend more.  He would personally like to see something done about the footpath between Burra and Burra North, which was a quagmire in wet weather.  The town had to be kept attractive to business.  He favoured the equal consideration of all wards.

The Institute debt was a real concern, but it was a good thing in that it had given the Council a home.

Something would have to be done as a memorial to the soldiers of the 1939-45 war.

He thought something like a park, tennis courts, gardens or a swimming pool would be more suitable than a block of marble.

S.J. Woollacott thanked his nominators and supporters.  He was keen to see the Town Hall debt reduced and was keen on the general beautification of the town.

Mr R.M. Reed said he would have preferred there to have been a contest for his seat, as there was for East Ward.  He would support a special rate to remove the Town Hall Debt and believed the Burra Electric Supply Co. should reduce its rate for street lighting.

East Ward candidates then addressed the meeting.

A.J. Hill asked if Council was going to improve Victoria Park.

Mr Jennison thought this might fall within his idea of a war memorial.
