‘Steel Beak’ writes again on the Burra races issue.  He understands people like Mr Pearse who grow up with sheep, horses and dogs are keen on races.  The supporters of the sheep dog trials must be equally disappointed when others fail to endorse their enthusiasm.  [He then digresses onto reminiscences of the last meeting he attended, in 1890 he believes.]

He says the cap of wowser seems to fit the church people after reading their replies: ‘ a true follower of our Saviour [who] has truly the love of God in their heart can go on to a racecourse or any other place on God’s earth and this will not defile him if his heart’s right with God.  On the other hand a man or woman having the devil in them all the week and going to church on Sunday this does not make either him or her a follower of our Saviour.’

N. Hiles Pearse responds again saying ‘Fairplay’s’ letter was neither intelligent nor logical.  ‘Fairplay’ infers that 98% of Burra people were wowsers which ‘I have yet to be shown they are’.

Mr Pearse denies being egotistical – or he would have been much more involved in Public Life.  The Burra Show and the Races are not comparable.  The former is essentially educational and the second purely sporting.  He also takes issue with the implied complaint of storekeepers paying half a day’s wages for no work.  ‘Had I all the money I have paid to employees in the past for doing nothing I would be quite financial.’

As for his own employees, not only does he not keep them at home, ‘Why man, most of them are paying members.’  They not only get a paid holiday on race day, but also for the dog trials – with a motor car to use on each occasion.  Finally if ‘Fairplay’ lived up to his name he would emerge from behind the nom de plume.
