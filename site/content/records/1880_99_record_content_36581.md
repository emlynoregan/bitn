Waterworks.  A deputation of local members waited upon the Commissioner of Public Works to get the interest rate on the waterworks reduced (currently between 5% & 6%) and pointing out the railways refused to buy any water as they had a scheme of their own.  The Commissioner undertook to look into it.
