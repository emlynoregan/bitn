The New Year

Kooringa Wesleyan Church held a Watch Night Service on New Year’s Eve that was well attended.  The New Year was greeted with guns and whistles.  There was no great hooliganism, though a few footbridges were upset and some gates and vehicles removed.  No great damage was done, though one pedestrian was tripped up by a gate left across a footpath.

Several shops were open to 9 p.m. on New Year’s Eve.

On New Year’s Day there was the usual Wesleyan Picnic at Koonoona and numerous private picnics in the country around the town.
