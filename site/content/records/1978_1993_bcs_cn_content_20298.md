Burra RSL Sub Branch.  President L.T. Simpson reports on 1989-90.

The Anzac Dawn Service was well attended.  The Armistice Day [Remembrance Day] observance was different this year with the 411th Regional Cadet Unit parading in front before joining the service and there was a good gathering of the public.  Appeals were held for Anzac, Legacy and Poppy Day and each elicited a good response.  Our annual dinner was voted out this year.  Thanks are extended particularly to the Ladies’ Auxiliary, Secretary Ben Kotz, Treasurer Brian Riggs and senior Vice-President John McBride.
