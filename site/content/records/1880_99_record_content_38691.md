‘Ajax’ writes another letter to a public man, this time to John Sampson - and again it is rather negative.

‘You have . . . occupied your seat . . . for something like eight or nine years, but for a considerable portion of that time you have in no way been a brilliant success.  Much of your unpopularity has been, no doubt, caused through your fidgety disposition.’

There is a very snide remark about his age and second childhood and also reference to his pretentious noises in announcing he would stand for Mayor, but withdrawing before nomination day.

‘it is at times to no credit to be overbearing even should your actions be looked upon by yourself as just.’

‘Very few people know much of you privately - this is perhaps just as well; yet you have been known to help on many things which would have fallen through had you not taken up with the cause and stood by it.  You can reckon yourself one of my particular friends - this is in your public life.’

‘Had your love for the cup which cheers in days gone by been a little less strong, you no doubt, would today be as it were a model Hercules.’
