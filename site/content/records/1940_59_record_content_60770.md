John Arthur Woods (25) was arrested near Mt Bryan and charged with the illegal use of a Ford Prefect sedan and a number of driving offences.  He had taken the car from Angus McLean Ltd of Adelaide and had been using it for about six weeks, during which time he had travelled about 10,000 miles.  He and his wife and four young children had been living in the vehicle for about a month in the outback parts of the state.
