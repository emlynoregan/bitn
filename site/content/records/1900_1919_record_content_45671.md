‘North Ward’ writes expressing amusement at the attempts of the Council to get money from the Government.  First they wanted £600 for three unnecessary bridges when £100 would do all that is required.  At the last meeting of Council they endorsed the Mayor’s agreement to borrow half the cost of the proposed bridge in Kooringa.  Can the Council borrow without ratepayers’ approval?  The sum is not large, but if they can borrow £100 without approval why not £1,000?
