In 1913 Ramblers merged with Kooringa to form Kooringa and Aberdeen continued, and a Light Horse Club was formed.

These three continued for 1914, though the Light Horse had to forfeit its matches after the 1st Semi-Final due to the outbreak of WWI.

In 1915 Kooringa & Light Horse merged to form Kooringa and Aberdeen continued.

1916-1918 Kooringa & Aberdeen were in recess due to WWI, though an occasional game was played for patriotic causes.

1919-1924 the two town teams were Kooringa & Aberdeen.

1925 & 1926 saw three town teams: Kooringa, Aberdeen & Ramblers.

1927-1929 there were two town teams: Aberdeen & Ramblers.

From 1930 to 1933 the two town teams were Aberdeen & Kooringa.

After that there was one town team called Kooringa and later Burra until Aberdeen was re-established in 1961.  The variations in the Associations within which these teams played are even more complicated]
