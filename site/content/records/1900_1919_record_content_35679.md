Obituary & Inquest.

Last Thursday Mr Mitchell SM conducted an inquest into the death of John Bull, found in front of the Bon Accord Hotel on Wednesday between 9.30 and 10 p.m. with a gaping wound in his neck.

Dr Steele had examined the deceased, having been called out to the hotel where the deceased was gasping for breath and died shortly after his arrival.  The wound appeared to have been inflicted by a short bladed instrument.  If he were right handed it could have been self-inflicted.

Ernest Warma, locomotive fireman, said he had seen the deceased talking to himself and pacing up and down outside the hotel about 8.30 p.m.  He returned about 9.30 p.m. when the deceased was sitting on a seat.  Warma went in for a drink and returned about 9.45 p.m. when the deceased was lying on the ground in a pool of blood.

John O’Brien confirmed Warma’s evidence.

Leonard John Hogan had noticed the deceased sitting and later on passing by heard the sound of liquid dropping.  Two men then laid the deceased on the ground and sent for a doctor and the police.

Thomas Gregg of the Bon Accord and J.P. Turley, manager for Drew & Crewes, also gave evidence.  Turley had known the deceased 20 years before at White Cliffs and to the best of his knowledge the body was that of John Bull, a native of the Hamilton District, Victoria.

M-C J.A. Skinner had found union tickets on the body in the name of J. Bull and his swag 300 yards from the hotel, but no other instrument.

[The deceased appears to have been experiencing hallucinations prior to his death.]

The verdict was death by a self-inflicted wound.
