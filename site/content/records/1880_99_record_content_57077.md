3rd Leader.  Municipal Matters

At the last meeting of Council Councillors Sampson and Parks, as representatives of East Ward, got some work passed for Ayers St.  The following day they got a dray and two men to work and a few hours later Cr Hardy appeared and instructed the overseer to tell ‘those fellows’ to stop work by order of the Chairman of Public Works.  The overseer, thinking he was under the power of this would-be conspicuous personage, acceded to the request, but the workers used their own judgement and carried on till 5 p.m.

Crs Sampson and Parks were justified in proceeding with the work: it was unlike work done recently in North Ward without the sanction of Council, yet there was nothing said about that, simply because Cr Hardy was implicated.  Cr Hardy had no more authority than anyone else to interfere and had the labourers knocked off a serious accident would have resulted, as on the road were placed loads of metal making it impassable.  Cr Hardy’s excuse at a Public Works Committee meeting on Friday night was to the effect that he had not been consulted.
