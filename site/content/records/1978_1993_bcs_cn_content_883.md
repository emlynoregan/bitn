Burra Community Library has volumes of the SA Register July 1852 to June 1876, bound as 43 volumes.  Ian Auhl recently advised that 49 volumes were presented to the Institute by the SA Mining Association to cover a period of 24 years and six months, along with 24 volumes of the Mining Journal.  Does anyone know the whereabouts of the missing six volumes or of the 24 volumes of the Mining Journal?
