M & BHA held its AGM and elected: President, Mrs H. Jennison; Vice-Presidents, Mesdames Odgers & Bannister; Secretary, Mrs McGee; Assistant Secretary, Mrs R. Thamm and Treasurer, Mrs Barry.

The report showed an average attendance at meetings of 12.  Clinic attendance was 513 for an average of 43 per month.  Many thanks to the CWA for agreeing to sell the M & BHA part of their land on which a temporary Housing trust home will be placed and established as a Clinic Centre and meeting room.  To help finance the new room a street stall in April raised £32.  [This building later became a private home and was eventually demolished in 2008.]
