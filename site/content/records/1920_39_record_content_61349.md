Phil Rule writes expressing his thanks for the efforts of Miss Pearce of the Burra Record staff for her role in making the children’s afternoon at Mongolata recently such a success.  She collected much of the material distributed and took it and Mr Rule out to Mongolata in her car.  She also acted as a judge for the children’s races and assisted in other ways on the day.
