Accident.  Fay Moore, 2-year old daughter of Mr & Mrs Ken Moore, went missing last Tuesday.  M-C Doddrill was informed and a search initiated.  After dark she was found at the bottom of a well 33 ft deep.  She was miraculously unhurt.  The well is situated in George St just over the ford leading east from Thames St and two doors from the Mooreâ€™s home.  Many of Mitchell Flat homes have wells and Fay said she was chasing a pussy when she fell into a big hole on the property of Mr Beckwith.  It took some time to extricate the child and her grandfather, Ted Moore, was finally lowered to her.  The bottom of the well was sandy.
