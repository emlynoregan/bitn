Accident-Obituary.

Mr Les Kellock aged 27, a pastoralist of Thistlebeds and son of Mr & Mrs H. Kellock, was the victim of a drowning accident at Thistlebeds on Wednesday evening.  He and his friend Mr Jack Oates went for a swim in one of the dams at about 7.30 p.m.  It is thought that after working in the heat Mr Kellock suffered cramp upon the sudden change of temperature.  Mr Oates tried to rescue Mr Kellock on a number of occasions, but was unable to bring him to the bank.  Eventually he had to seek help from the homestead, but by then aid was too late.  P.C. Brooks of Burra recovered the body from ten feet of water on his fifth attempt.

[Lesley Hamilton Kellock, born 2 July 1918, Thistlebeds: died 30 January 1946, Thistlebeds.]
