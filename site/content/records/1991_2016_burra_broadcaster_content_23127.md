Fire.  A house fire at Mt Bryan completely gutted the building that was formerly the old Mt Bryan Post Office and Telephone Exchange.  A man and two children were in the house at the time and were alerted to the fire by a passing bus.  Five CFS units attended from Mt Bryan, Hallett, Booborowie and two from Burra with police, two SES units and the Ambulance.  The cause is believed to have been an electrical fault.  The Barrier Highway was closed with traffic diverted around Mt Bryan while the blaze was brought under control.  [Photo]
