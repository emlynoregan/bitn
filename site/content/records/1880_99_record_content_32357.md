Notwithstanding the report above about Sir Thomas Gratton Esmonde the paper then says a Grand Concert was held in the Institute Hall and a first class program was gone through and prizes distributed.  [Perhaps this was written and set before the event, or perhaps they managed to wrap it around the speech of Sir Thomas, but the two are incompatible as written.]
