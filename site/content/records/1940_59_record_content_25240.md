Burra Centenary Celebrations have shown a profit of £500.  The Treasurer Mr K.R. Crewes presented this news on Tuesday evening.  Mr R.A. Bevan moved that a public meeting be called to rescind the motion (passed at a public meeting at which the committee was elected) stating that all profits had to go towards building a swimming pool in Burra.
