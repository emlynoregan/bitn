Mr & Mrs Hector Bagg of Paradise are about to leave Burra to live at Port Noarlunga.  Mr Bagg is a son of the late Mr & Mrs E. Bagg of Baldina and has lived in the district all his life.  Mr Hector Baggâ€™s departure has been delayed by the illness of his brother Mr Walter Bagg who is in Burra Hospital.  [The only Hector Bagg I can trace is Edmond Hector Scott Bagg whose father was Frederick, but known as Ted, which might just account for the E. Bagg.  But his brother Walter Edgar Bagg died in 1896 aged 20.  There must be some others of this name not readily traced in Births & Deaths CDs.]
