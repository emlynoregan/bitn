The 21st Burra Antique and Collectibles Fair was held last weekend. Burra was inundated with visitors.  The event kicked off with a celebratory dinner on Friday night at the Bowling Club with traders, organisers and management committee in attendance.  Fair co-ordinators were Leonie Ambler, Ken Jacobs and Paul Marsson.  Market Square and best Place were alive with activity on Saturday morning and visitors formed a long queue at the Burra Town Hall.  The fair was opened by radio personality and columnist Peter Goers.  Visitors were entertained by pianist Bruce Leach.  Traders were kept busy and so was the caf√© area.  The shuttle bus was well patronised.  The Clare Concert Band also played on both days of the fair.  Rusty Relics returned to the Treasure Trove performing a variety of country tunes and Tracey Rains and friends entertained visitors, busking at Patiennes Ice creamery at Burra North.  While Sunday numbers were down a little, the traders were pleased with the success of the event.  Leonie Ambler said in the six years of being at the helm the fair had grown significantly and there was increasing interest from interstate traders.  Stalls had grown from 20 to 40.  The fair was becoming one of the premier events of its kind in SA.  Both the Town Hall and the school gym are almost fully booked for next year.
