Burra Town Council, 1 July.

Meeting days are to be 1st Monday and 3rd Saturday in the month henceforth to allow the Mayor to attend at least on the Saturday.  Burra Hospital deeds still cannot be found and their loss is to be advertised.

Following his request the Waterworks Engineer’s salary has been increased to £2-8-0 a week.

Waterworks Committee:

Cr Rabbich, Chairman, read a Waterworks report and moved its adoption.  2nd Cr O’Leary.  Cr Sampson moved it not be adopted as the committee had not met and it was therefore not a committee report.  2nd Cr Hardy and carried.

Cr Rabbich announced his intention to resign as chairman.

The deed for the Recreation Ground has been received from SAMA.

All hands except the Dayman are to be discharged to try to keep the account in credit till the end of the year as the main roads work was done and the Dayman could catch up on other work.

Cr Hardy called attention to the problem of straying cattle for which ‘even councillors are guilty’.
