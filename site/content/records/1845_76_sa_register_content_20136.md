Kooringa News, 23 January

An inquest was held at the Redruth Court House on 17 January into the causes of the fire at Captain Killicoat’s land.  Isaac Phillips, a shepherd employed by Captain Killicoat, gave evidence of the discovery of the fire, but said he’d seen no persons in the vicinity that day or the previous day.

W.C. Cotterill, clerk at the Smelting Works, said he and Albert Fuss had helped to extinguish the fire and saw no one around.

Henry Potter, a youth employed by Mr Macnamara Jnr, discovered the fire as he was returning from Mr Mill’s house at Firewood Creek, where he had been doctoring a horse and he alerted Captain Killicoat.

[There is a complicated story involving J.R. Gray, Henry Macnamara, Barbara Griffiths (wife of John Griffiths), D. Macnamara and Bennett Smith, but it produced no evidence to show how the fire started.]

An entertainment on 21 January at the Institute raised more than £4 to benefit the librarian Mr Cross.

Many complaints are made regarding the inconvenience of Cobb & Co.’s coaches.
