Obituary.  Charles Dewhirst – 1 June 1969 to 20 December 2003.

Charles was the third child of Gillian & Alan Dewhirst and was born at Clare.  He had two sisters, Virginia and Andrea.  He was an adventurous and independent young boy, walking at twelve months and swimming the channel at Fisherman’s Bay and diving from the Pt Broughton Jetty at five years of age.  He began school at Booborowie and played football and cricket, but his real love was trucks.  At age 11 he was driving all manner of farm machinery and soon moved onto motorbikes and cars.  He went to BCS, but left at 15½ to drive trucks.  After working locally for a few years, he went to Kalgoorlie, working for Roche Bros.  Two daughters, Ashlii-Maree and Laimii-Lee, were born to him and Jenny.  Returning to SA in 1944, Charlie was driving trucks for as many hours as the law allowed.  In 1999 he started work at Booth Transport in Tanunda and in 2000 moved to Freeling.  A highlight was carting water at the eclipse at Lyndhurst.  Leisure time was spent at the Murray River, teaching his daughters to swim and skiing on his knee-board.  Charlie’s ashes are to be interred at Burra Cemetery.
