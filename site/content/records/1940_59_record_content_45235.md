Car Accidents.  The dangerous Black Springs Road added three victims to its tally in the last week.

John O’Connor of Broken Hill and a passenger were shaken up when their car skidded on loose gravel and struck a tree at 8.15 p.m. on Monday.

Mrs Gwendoline Joyce Bettison of Renown Park, her father, son and a lady friend, were bruised and shaken when her car turned over on Thursday near Gilbert’s, where a man died in a similar accident 18 months ago.

Mr Maurice Bednall’s car turned onto its side about 7 miles south of Burra.  This is believed to be due to one wheel grabbing and slewing the car around on the loose surface.  We hope the District Council of Saddleworth, which is responsible for this section of the road, will bring pressure on the Government to get the new main road through Hanson begun, as has long been promised.
