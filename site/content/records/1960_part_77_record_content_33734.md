District Main Roads.  Announcement by S.C. Bevan, Minister of Roads.

Construction and sealing of the Spalding-Burra Road is not scheduled before 1970-71 because of the need to complete construction and sealing of the Clare-Hanson section of the Lochiel-Burra main road 46, which has commenced and is programmed for completion 1969-71.

Burra-Morgan Road should be upgraded to ‘open-surface’ standard beginning 1967-68.

National Route 23 to Broken Hill presently is the Tarlee-Clare-Jamestown-Peterborough road, but the best route would be Riverton-Saddleworth-Burra, which is shorter.  Route 23 signs will be re-allocated to it within the next three weeks.
