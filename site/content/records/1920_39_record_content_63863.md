Miss Bentley’s Shop.  When we reported that Miss Bentley’s shop had won second prize in the smaller shop section for decorations, we had not seen the interior decorations of the window.  They were very beautiful, comprising an exquisite floral carpet of rose petals and lovely dolls in period costume.
