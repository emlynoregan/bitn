Joel Mosser writes as a visitor to the town and makes a series of observations and asks some questions:

It is a pretty place.

It is a pity more business is not done in it.

Why are roads to the market being fenced off when sheep cannot be driven through the main street?

Why are so many back streets closed?

The mine has been closed for many years.  What is wrong with the directors?

Stallions run loose in paddocks.  This would not be allowed in other towns.

The town boasts of its poultry, but it needs to exhibit in neighbouring areas to justify this â€“ they are not even enough for my fancy.
