Kooringa Court, Monday.

Thomas Casey was fined 10/- for being drunk, but whilst drunk he had said:

‘The King is a — rotten — cow’,

had made similar remarks about Queen Mary and Lord Kitchener and gave three cheers for the Kaiser.  For this he was sentenced to 14 days for disloyal language and the matter was reported to Military Authorities for further enquiry.
