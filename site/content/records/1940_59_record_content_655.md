An extract from a diary of 9 April 1846 is printed.  It had been printed in the paper of 31 July 1907.  It tells of a visit of the Governor Sir George Grey with Mr Thomas and Capt. Finnis.  They inspected the surface and underground workings with Capt. Ey.  On 10 April 1846 it talks of a survey of 120 acres for the township and the marking of the boundaries of the blocks.  On 11 April it reports the departure of Mr Gleeson on a day so dusty that candles had to be lit inside to write by.  Wallace finished the first cottage in the town, which was then ready to roof.  Mr Kingston finished his survey of Kooringa, having laid out 65 half-acre blocks, 3 blocks of 2/2 acres [sic?] for cottages and 10 acres for Crawford.  131 tons 13 cwt of ore was sent to Adelaide that week.
