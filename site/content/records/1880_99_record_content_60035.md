Editorial on The New SA Parliament and the State of the Colony.

The writer saw the new Parliament as ‘the best we have had for many years’. 

He is pleased to note the direct representation of commercial interests and in general a good cross-section of all classes and interests.  The outlook for the season is not too encouraging.  To the south the season has opened all right, but to the north and east rains have been light and the stock is dying.  The labour market has eased with the exodus to the West and so unemployment is comparatively low.  There is a move to form a new political party – something between the Capitalists, whose interests are reflected in the National Defence League, and the Trades and Labour Council.

Internationally things are uncertain.  German diplomacy is tortuous in its ways and a general European War could yet come to pass over South Africa.  The USA is estranged from England – largely over the silver question.  The demonetisation of silver and the resulting low prices for it have caused bitter feelings.
