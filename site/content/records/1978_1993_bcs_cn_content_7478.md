Tropical Cyclones Ken and Elinor off the northwest and northeast coasts of Australia respectively fed tropical moist air into SA.  On Wednesday afternoon and evening 38 mm of rain fell.  At about 7.15 p.m.  the tributary creek that flows through Kooringa burst its banks and sent torrents of water along Commercial Street.  Some flooding occurred in businesses along Commercial Street, but hardest hit were the heritage cottages in Thames Street, some of which had 30 cm of water flowing through them at the peak.
