Notice.  Burra Electric Supply Co. Ltd is carrying out maintenance work for the period 11 February to 18 February and will be relying on one generating unit only.  No problem is anticipated, but if lights dim consumers are requested to immediately reduce consumption, as this will indicate the generator has reached its load limit.
