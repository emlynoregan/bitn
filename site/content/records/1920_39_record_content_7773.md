Redruth Court, 19 May

Frank John Evans a fishmonger, who recently began a business in Aberdeen, was charged with stealing a buggy cushion from J.T. Hobert of Gawler on 22 April.  He claimed to have bought the cushion.  Hobart said that Evans had approached him on 15 May and offered him £3 to withdraw the prosecution.  Hobart agreed and gave a receipt for 10/0 for the cushion and another document withdrawing the accusation.  Hobart did not know that his actions were illegal.  Evans in evidence said he had bought the cushion.  He had gone to Hobart and said he had not stolen the cushion, but offered the money as a prosecution would damage his business in Burra.  [Offering 10/- for the cushion and the rest as compensation.]

Found guilty and fined £3 or 1 month.
