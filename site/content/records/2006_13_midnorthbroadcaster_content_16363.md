Wolf Creek 2 is filming in Burra.  The principal photography for this movie began in SA in January and next week will continue in Burra.  A crew of about 50 will be in town, including the stars of the film John Jarratt, who is again taking the role of the sadistic Mick Taylor and Ryan Corr from Packed to the Rafters.  The film also stars Shannon Ashlyn (Puberty Blues and Devil’s Dust) and Philippe Klaus (Devil’s Dust and Rake).  Co-producer is Helen Leake.  She said the majority of filming in Burra would be done over three days.  This sequel comes seven years after the first Wolf Creek hit international screens.  It opened in Australia in November 2005 and took $1.22 million in its first week.  In the UK it was given a modest release in September 2005 and grossed £1.5 million.  In the USA it opened on Christmas Day 2005 and grossed $16,188,180 on American screens.  Elsewhere overseas it garnered $11,574,468 to bring in a gross total of $27,762,648.
