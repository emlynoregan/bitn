Burra Town Council

The Mayor said he had been overwhelmed by the response of the Governor to the recent visit.  He had received a letter of thanks addressed to the inhabitants of Burra and to him personally.  Then an autographed picture of the vice-regal family and now a handsome pearl scarf-pin.

The Victoria Park wall is in a bad way.  Some 30 ft on the western side was toppling due to tree roots.  In a number of places boys climbing over had removed the coping stones and in many places the poor quality stone had fretted into holes.  There was no cheap solution and an inspection was planned for the 2 May.

Cr Radford moved the reduction of one days pay for the lamplighter not lighting lamps over Easter Sunday and Monday.  After discussion at the last meeting there was not a lamp alight in the north end of town and the next evening only one between Aberdeen and Kooringa.  Not 2nd.

After considerable discussion a caution was decided upon and a schedule outlining the lamplighterâ€™s duties is to be drawn up.
