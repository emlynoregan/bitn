Fitting out of displays in the new and existing buildings	50,000

Appointment of a Heritage Officer		       35,000

$470,000

Restoration and adaptation of the Paxton Square Cottages has been implemented, with the prior approval of the J150 Board and the funds allocated as designated.  Funds were also allocated to the proposal by Council and through the Government’s Wage Pause-Job Creation Scheme.

The J150 Board in its letter to the Chairman of the District Council indicated that repairs to the Bon Accord Mine Buildings, repairs and restoration of Morphett’s Pump House and the appointment of the Heritage Officer should all proceed as soon as possible – in liaison with the Heritage Conservation Branch and the History Trust.

The Board has imposed a condition on the establishment of the Copper Interpretive Centre that the whole of the Bon Accord Site must be transferred to the Burra Burra DC.

It is currently owned by the National Trust and negotiations for its transfer are proceeding with the Trust’s State Executive.  The Burra Branch of the National Trust has advised Council that it supports this transfer in the best interests of the heritage of Burra and the preservation of the site.

Council will call a public meeting at the Civic Centre on Tuesday 24 July at 8 p.m. to advise the public of all matters concerned with the project, the reasons for the minor variations to the Council’s original application and the delay in reaching the approval in principle stage.  It will seek the support of the community to ensure the entire project is completed in the SA Jubilee year 1986.
