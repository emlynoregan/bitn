24 October 1846, page 2

The Spartan arrived at Gravesend 20 May carrying a large quantity of Burra ore.

The John Heyes reached the UK 28 June and the Arcadia with the first cargo of ore directed to Swansea had also arrived.

The news from England reveals as yet no sale of Burra Burra ore, but a sample from the Taglioni had assayed at 47%.

Shares in the Burra Burra Mines again exceeded £100 on Saturday.

Adelaide Shipping –Unusually, four ships from England arrived on the same day.

The Hoogly left London and then Plymouth 3 July with c. 240 cabin passengers and emigrants.

The Britannia left London 6 June with 140 passengers.

The Gunga left Liverpool 27 June with 1 passenger.

The Taglioni left London 27 June with 3 passengers.

The Raven also arrived from Launceston with 9 passengers and 12 horses.

The emigrants on the Hoogly with those who have preceded them make up 500 sent out by the English Mining Company and they are to be followed by 300 more from that company.

At least three other ships are immediately expected.

Passenger lists are printed along with lists of the cargoes.

[Among others on the Hoogly were Matthew Bryant, Henry Roach, W.H. Challoner and Solomon Williams and his wife.]
