Eudunda Uniting Church

[There is an article to commemorate the closing service of the Eudunda Uniting Church building, though the ministry will continue in another format in other sites.  From the late 1870s Wesleyan services were held in a building on the site of the present St John’s Lutheran Church, but the first resident minister was not appointed till 1885.  In that year it was decided to build the present building at a cost of £250.  Construction was completed in February 1888 and the building has been in use up to this closing service.  A Sunday school was erected behind the church in 1960.  It became the Uniting Church upon the amalgamation of the Methodist, Presbyterian and Congregational Churches in June 1977.  In the late 1970s the church was re-roofed and renovated internally.]
