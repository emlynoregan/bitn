On Thursday at 3 p.m. a second storm deposited 24 mm of rain and hail in 45 minutes.  Flooding was extensive.  The creek [from the Gaol] threatened houses in Tregony Street and at one stage there were 25 SES volunteers battling to save houses there.  Two of them were swept away in the watercourse, but escaped with minor cuts and bruises.
