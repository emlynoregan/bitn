Burra Burra Hospital Inc. held its AGM last Thursday night.  The Board remains unchanged.  Chairman R.K. Pearse’s report: the 95th Annual Report.

Financial.  With a surplus of $21,582-90 our credit balance stands at $48,266 plus $25,000 invested.  The only major increase in costs has been $8,909 in wages.  There are now 15 full-time nursing staff and 4 part-time.  The daily average cost per patient rose by $2.26 to $14.08 and the daily average of patients was 19.8.  50 babies were born at the hospital.

Improvements’   It had been hoped that improvements forecast last year would be a reality.  Plans and specifications have been approved and tenders called.  Estimates were submitted to the Hospitals Department and we await their approval.  The estimated cost of the project is $240,000.    We will be able to finance this from hospital finances and will not have a public appeal.  The only major improvements this year have been the enclosing of the ambulance entrance and replacing twenty-one beds and mattresses for $3,100.  Finance permitting we will paint the exterior this year.  The remaining rooms of the Nurses Quarters have been re-painted and new curtains hung.

Cropping Program.  No Cropping was undertaken this year due to the late season.

Ladies’ Auxiliary.  This continues to give valuable assistance with keeping the hospital linen in order and by provision of jams and preserves.

Burra & District Fund Raising Committee.  This year a cheque for $1,020 was donated.  The new building will require $16,000 worth of new equipment so any money raised will be used in that direction.

Staff.  Matron Fyfe and the Secretary-Manager Mr L. Packer have continued their excellent service.  Matron has been ably assisted by Sisters Byles, Ward, Wright, Brown, McDonald, Moller, Lucas & Carmody during the year and by Sisters Parker and Broad on staff at present as well as a very willing bans of nurses.  Sister Good has ably filled the role of Tutor Sister.  The domestic staff and handy-man have carried out their duties diligently.

Meals on Wheels is proving to be one of the most worthwhile operations commenced in the district for some time.

[Various other people and Board members are then thanked.]

I regret the passing of Mr Matt Carmody, a Board Member for eleven years, and welcome Mr Harry Rich to the Board.
