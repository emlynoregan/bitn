Burra Primary School held a break-up party last Thursday, given by the School welfare Club.

[Details in ⅓ column.]

Prize and award winners are listed.

Mr L. Davis read his report.

The year had been made more difficult than usual due to epidemics of illness, despite which 90% of students had been promoted.  The roll was now 172 and falling due to removals.  No school function had been held this year to raise funds and scholars had relied on the generosity of the Welfare Club.

Religious Instruction had worked smoothly.

In the War Effort cash donations had now reached £173-3-6, including £56 raised for the POW Fund.

Waste product collection had raised £240-17-4½, War Savings totalled £802-2-4, Nets were worth £7-7-6 and knitting £27-3-11 to make a total war effort of £1,250-14-7.

[Details of other patriotic work are given, including the making of 35 camouflage nets and many knitted articles.]
