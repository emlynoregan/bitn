Burra Burra DC.  Budget for 1991-92

Total general rate revenue for 1991-92 is estimated at $795,000.

The overall valuation of the district has decreased by about $27 million, with some valuations in the eastern area falling by 60%.

In the township of Burra valuations rose by about 10%.

The overall budget for 1991-92 is $1.4 million; a decrease of 8.9% on the previous budget.  The increased rate revenue is 1.4% to enable a balanced budget as at 30 June 1992.

A Burra Cemeteries Advisory Committee has been established.  This follows the recommendations of the recently completed Conservation Plan for Burra Cemeteries by McDougall & Vines, Architectural & Heritage Consultants.

The O’Connor Shed will have a new galvanised iron roof by September.  The shed is included in a proposal for a Merino development to include the saleyards, the recreation park adjoining the Bon Accord hotel and extending to the Railway Station.

Council is opposing the closure of the District Registry situated within the Council Office and seeking the support of Tourism SA to ensure the retention of Births, Deaths and Marriage Records in Burra.

Rosslyn Breeding of Yunta and a member of ICPA (Isolated children’s Parents’ Association) submits a poem that reveals a recent clearing sale at ‘Hogback’ that apparently attracted 700 men, women and children and after considerable difficulties as outlined in the verse, resulted in the eight ladies of the ICPA making c. $1,000.
