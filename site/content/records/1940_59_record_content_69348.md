‘Shareholder’ writes re the Burra Electric Supply Co. saying that Mr Bednall and his committee know what they have spent for machinery, equipment and the cost of upkeep, but they have evidently overestimated the present value of the same.  They have done a good job, but the writer thinks shareholders are not prepared to do more than they have already and it would be well to have the plant valued by a consultant or qualified engineers and to sell now, because in a few months it will be of less value.
