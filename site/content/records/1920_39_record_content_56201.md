After the meal an adjournment was made to the RSL rooms where the Governor met returned men at an informal gathering.

Lady Dugan did not travel with her husband in the afternoon, but instead visited the CWA Rest Room in Pearce’s Building, where she met with members of the CWA, Red Cross and the Burra Benevolent Society.  She was greeted by Mrs I.J. Warnes, President of Burra CWA; Mrs John Tennant, President of Burra Red Cross Branch and Mesdames W.H. Field, A.B. Riggs & G.C. Hutchinson representing the Benevolent Society.  [Speeches from this occasion are printed.]

On Wednesday morning the Vice-Regal visitors went to the Burra Schools where scholars from the Church of England Day School, St Joseph’s Convent School and Copperhouse Primary School had also gathered to form a guard of honour with the Primary School Fife & Drum Band.  Again it was bitterly cold with a piercing wind.  While the students marched around to the yard for an assembly, the visitors inspected the classrooms.  Many parents and friends also attended the assembly, which celebrated Empire Day as well as the Vice-Regal Visit.  The Governor said he was so impressed with the school that he granted an extra day’s holiday.  [Again speeches are reported, but they were short on account of the bleak conditions.]

This visit was followed by an informal one to Burra Hospital.  This started with morning tea, after which there was an inspection of the buildings.  The Governor met members of the Board, which included Sir John Melrose.

In the afternoon Lady Dugan visited the Girl Guides and Brownies at Hallett Hall where the girls entertained her with items and afternoon tea.  At 5.15 she went to Ulooloo as the guest of Sir John and Miss Melrose.
