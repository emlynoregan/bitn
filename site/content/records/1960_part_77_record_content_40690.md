Burra Swimming Pool.  At a public meeting called by the Mayor E.T. Baulderstone a management committee was formed to operate the pool and its facilities.  At first it was run by the committee which oversaw its construction. This was then replaced by the Burra & District Swimming Pool Committee.  Over the years interest apparently waned and two years ago it was virtually forced onto the Council.  Since then, despite an operating profit, the pool has not made enough to meet the repayment of the loan incurred for the filtration plant.  The average attendance of 85 makes it clear that maintenance and operation of the pool has to be on a volunteer basis.  It would be disastrous to take the pool away from the youth of the town.  The committee of twelve will be elected annually.
