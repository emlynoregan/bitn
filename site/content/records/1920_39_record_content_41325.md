Burra Town Council, 21 March

A reply via C.A.S. Hawker from the Post Master General about lowering long distance phone charges stated it was not possible to lower charges for such calls.

The auditor-General asked why certain licences had been reduced from £3 to 30/- and drawing attention to the £70 owing on rates.

The Town Clerk said both matters could be explained.

[The explanation of the former is not very clear in the paper.]

The arrears in rates are largely due to unclaimed properties, which the Council intended selling to go towards liquidation of the debt.  They had been outstanding and accumulating for 20 years.

In the event of the properties being sold the money obtained will pay the rates and the debt will not be handed on to the buyers.
