Peter Maynard was riding his bicycle on the main road near the Mine entrance on Monday 11 October when he encountered a 4 ft 6 inch snake.  The startled snake attempted to strike Peter on the leg, but only left two small marks on his boot about one inch below the top.  Peter was saved by his ‘Beatle boots’.
