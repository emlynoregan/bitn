Accident.  In Saturday evening the gas lamp on Park’s corner exploded at about 6.45 p.m. soon after being lit.  The cause was probably due to its being dirty.  No one was hurt, but the door of the lamp was driven into a tree about 14’ away to a depth of several inches and all that remained standing was the base.  This is the second town lamp to explode.
