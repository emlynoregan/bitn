Burra Town Council, 17 February

Commandant of the 4th Military advises that no topographical information is to be supplied to unauthorised persons.

The Mayor said an inspection of flood damage revealed it to be greater than first thought.

The Overseer said street had not been washed because he could not get a hose.  The Council’s hose was worn out and he did not consider it necessary to get another, as it might be 15 years before another flood.  (The Fire Station’s hydrant was 2” and so its hose would not fit the 1½” Council hydrant.)

Young St at Gully’s Wharf opposite Mr Roy Jeffery’s house was the worst place.  Several loads of silt had already been removed from town streets.

Resolved the Council buy 40 drums of Colac for necessary repairs.

Local Board of Health.
