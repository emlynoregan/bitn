When Arthur Climbed the ‘Chimley’

T’was one of Summer’s afternoons

The great stack showed up grimly

When a small boy in pantaloons

Climbed up the old Smelts ‘Chimley’.

Did he see clear with his small brain?

Or did he vision dimly

The dangerous task he’d undertaken

To climb that monster ‘chimley’.

No sense of fear distresses him

As he hastens on so nimbly

As with a face stern set and grom

He starts to climb that ‘chimley’.

Yes, up he goes: He cannot stop

And he proceeds quite trimly

Hurrah! Hurrah! He has reached the top

He has climbed the Old Smelts ‘chimley’.

Oh what a scene burst on his view

A picture grand and kingly

What pity ‘tis so very few

Have climbed up that old chimley.

Now to descend; he has no fear;

And he clambers down quite slimly

One thing alone to him is clear

He has conquered that ‘old chimley’.

I must go home, there’ll be a row

I will be lectured primly

But none of them can stop me now
