Burra Air Force Assoc. has become the first branch in SA to have its own club room in Queen Street.  Previously they have shared a room in the old Eastern Telephone building with other organisations including the stock firm Richardson, Kempe, Hogarth & Edwards Ltd.  With only 40 members the purchase of the block in Queen St was quite an achievement.  It is hoped that renovations with the aid of working bees will see the meetings held at the new room early in 1956.  The change will greatly improve the section of Queen Street involved.
