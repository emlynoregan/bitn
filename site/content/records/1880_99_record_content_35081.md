The Record Newspaper and General Printing Office.

At the beginning of July 1876 Messrs Henry Pether and Frank Jarman commenced business somewhere near the spot where the office now stands.  The Mine was still operating and the move would seem to be a good and profitable business.  The first paper was on the first Friday in July 1876 and was a double demy sheet of 28 columns as now.  [This is not strictly true.  In the first issue there were 4 pages of 5 columns each for a total of 20 columns.  This became 4 pages of 6 columns for a total of 24 columns from the second issue until the paper changed its name to the Burra News & Northern Mail on 5 January 1877, when the 7 column pages were introduced.]

It was printed on an old Columbian hand press.  It was called The Northern Mail.

The first year saw a good profit and on 1 January the name was changed to The Burra News.  [Actually to The Burra News and Northern Mail.]  All went well till June 1878 when the proprietors decided to give up the business:

‘A good and prosperous run was then experienced in both the news and jobbing departments until June 1878 when by some unaccountable means matters began to take place which caused the then proprietors, Messrs Pether and Jarman, to think about giving up the business, which they did, and the whole thing was taken up by a committee of resident gentlemen of whom the present proprietor, Mr F.W. Holder was one.’

The whole enterprise was then taken over by a committee of local gentlemen of which the present proprietor, F.W. Holder, was one.  On 5 July 1878 the paper was rechristened and made its appearance under its present title of the Burra Record.  [Actually it appeared for a short time simply as The Record.]  After fourteen months Holder took over as sole proprietor on 3 September 1880.  For two years and four months great strides were made and despite the closure of the mine the paper prospered, securing a large circulation beyond the town and good business was also done in the jobbing department.
