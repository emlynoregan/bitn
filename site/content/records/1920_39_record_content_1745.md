Burra Hospital Board

The Inspector General of Hospitals wanted to know why the hospital asked to be declared under the Rating for Hospitals Act 1919.  They replied:

It was desirable that the hospital be kept as a subsidised hospital and unless it comes under the Act the Board may be unable to maintain it as it is and it would become a Government Institution.  [Treating only the poor.]

As rating for hospitals becomes general it will be futile to attempt to raise funds for the hospital voluntarily.

The Soldiers’ Aid Society continues to send money to the Red Cross Produce Depot – there still being some 300 soldiers in our Military Hospitals in Adelaide.  Members agreed to sew for the Adelaide Children’s Hospital, as the Red Cross no longer needs sewing.
