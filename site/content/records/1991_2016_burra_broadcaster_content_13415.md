Burra CFS had eight members attend a rigorous hazard materials course at Woomera over the weekend.  Burra will become a HAZMAT brigade soon, as one of the few in SA.  With the change will come an extra truck and equipment provided by government funding.  Burra will then fill the gap between HAZMAT services at Clare, Jamestown and Waikerie.
