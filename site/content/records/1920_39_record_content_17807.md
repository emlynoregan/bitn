Ayers Forest

George Seal & Martin Seal write a letter:

They say they believe that strong influences are at work to save the forest and embarrass the Government.  If, as the Commissioner states, small forests are unprofitable then getting rid of them is not unreasonable.  Extravagant statements have been made to bolster the case.  Mr Goodridge says the ground is too rough to grow wheat â€“ it was ploughed before the trees were planted and indeed most of the area is practically level or undulating.  It is strange that in a fertile valley like Booborowie just the area within the forest is infertile.  As for those who virtuously voted not to apply for the blocks, not more than six at the meeting would have been eligible, [the others] already owning sufficient land to bar them from applying.
