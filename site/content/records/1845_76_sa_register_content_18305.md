Kooringa News, 4 March [date unclear]

Inquest/Obituary.  An inquest was held before Mr MacDermott at the Burra Hotel into the death of Mr W. Harvey the previous day on the Burra Mine.

W. Moore, mate of the deceased:

Harvey was ascending in the bucket and about four fathoms up he must have missed his footing on stepping off onto the plat, as he fell upon me and right on his head.  His neck must have been dislocated at once.

Josiah Jeffreys gave a similar account and Bennet Dalby, the chief timberman, also gave corroborative evidence.
