11.	He hoped the meeting would appoint a deputation to ask the council to rescind the motion.  He had given the necessary notice and it would come on at 8 p.m. next Monday.

Cr Symons raised the issue of the cemetery road [rather irrelevantly] and said there were other urgent needs in East Ward, such as Mitchell’s Flat.

Mr Phillips asked how much in rates was collected from property along the new footway.

Cr Sampson thought about 17/-.

P.L. Killicoat thought it folly now to make a footway on the eastern side.

Mr Lasscock moved to uphold the action of the East Ward councillors in protesting against this work being done.  2nd P.L. Killicoat and carried nem. con.

Mr Geake thought that with 50 voices in support the Council would be open to reason.  The subsidies would soon end and the places needing attention must get it now while there were funds.

J. Roach thought the footway was not wanted if it cost much and it would be a waste of money if it cost half the £500 mentioned.

Mr Steele moved a deputation consisting of Messrs Killicoat, C. Drew, Geake, Holder, Phillips, Launder, Watt, Kennedy, A. Harris and the chairman, wait on Council to request them to rescind the resolution to proceed with the work.  Mr Harry 2nd.  Carried.
