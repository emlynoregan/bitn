Burra Town Council 8 December.

Burra Electric Supply co. will install extra lighting for Christmas Eve.

Burra Fire Brigade asks that the middle wall in the fire Station be bolted and putty plastered as it is in a bad way.  The Mayor said it was the responsibility of the Fire Brigade Board.

Councillors congratulated each other and the Mayor on their re-election or election.

The Town Clerk said the present assessment was about £2,489 and the Council had a credit balance of £156.
