Burra High School Parents & Friends’ Association held its AGM least Week.  Elected: President, Mrs O. Holmes; Vice-Presidents, Mrs P. Buckton & Mrs L. Kempster; Secretary, Mrs P. Brereton; Assistant Secretary, Mrs E. McMahon & Treasurer, Mrs V. Spackman.  In 1973 $879.68 was raised.  The organisation was busy catering at sports day and at the inter-school sports hosted here in May.  During the year two local cafés closed, one of which had been delivering lunches to the school.  A school canteen was started in conjunction with the Primary School.  Mrs Webster and her willing helpers produced a profit of $400 by the year’s end.  The annual ball was again a success and raised $374.52.  [Major purchases for the year are listed.]
