Mr Jack Harvey who has conducted a successful grocery business for many years at Burra North has sold it to Mr Seccar.  [He subsequently ran a greengrocerâ€™s shop for some years at Prospect near the intersection of Prospect and Irish Harp Roads (now Regency Road).]

Burra High School began the year with a record number of 72 students: 37 in 1st Year, 18 in 2nd Year, 12 in Intermediate and 5 in Leaving.

The increase is partly due to the transport service introduced this year from Willalo, Hallett and Mt Bryan.  This collects 23 or 24 students.

Staff changes:

Mr Ivor Burdon replaces Mr Blight.

Mr Colin Laubsch replaces Mr K. Parkinson.
