Part 1 was completed by Ian Auhl and Steve Gilbert.  It identified the precincts of Burra, the important historic buildings and rated them in terms of their importance and need for preservation and made suggestions for their future.

Part 2 was completed by the firm of Lester, Firth and Murton.  They worked with a steering committee comprising local people from the District Council, National Trust, Department of Urban and Regional Affairs and the Department of the Environment.  The purpose of this part was to analyse the character of Burra and set objectives and policies to guide the future conservation and development of the town and prepare practical guidelines for specific areas of Burra itself.

Over the next few weeks we will print selected portions from the study to give some idea of the importance of the study and the importance of Burra itself.
