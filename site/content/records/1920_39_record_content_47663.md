Burra Town Council, 21 September

The Commissioner of Highways advises that the superstructure of the Kooringa Bridge is to be reconstructed.

The Mayor complained that the Department had not provided proper detour signs.

Cr March agreed and said a sign was needed at Ford’s to direct traffic to take the Redruth road.

Cr Dow was afraid it was Council responsibility.

Cr Jennison backed a letter to the Department, which was carried.

The shop in Kooringa recently Mr J. Allen’s was now transferred to Mr Aberg.

The Town Clerk reported the disappearance of ten young trees – he suspected mischievous children.

The Mayor however, thought they had been stolen.  The Overseer had not been able to locate them.

The headmaster of the school will be interviewed.

The Finance Committee recommended borrowing £100, which would be subsidised by the Government with £300 to allow £400 worth of work to be done.

The Mayor said the Record had said the men would get rations, but they would be paid all the money and not get rations.

Unpaid rates amount to £80.

Wirth Bros.’ Circus is coming on 6 October.

Burra Indoor Bowls Final was held last week.  Ramblers beat St Mary’s 20 to 16 making a play-off necessary.
