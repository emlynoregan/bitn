Burra Town Council, 18 March.

Letter of thanks received from Surgeon-Major Steele upon congratulations for his MC.

It is proposed to enlarge the grassed area around the Rotunda and to plant some shrubs and make it a fit place for the addition later of a soldiersâ€™ memorial.

Cr McWaters was somewhat concerned that he had got money from business people around the Square for having it tarred and now the proposal seemed to be changing.

Cr Greenwood would like to see the reserve area fenced and the road between the Burra Hotel and the Rotunda closed to motor traffic because of the dangerous corner.
