Strike at Waukaringa

H. Moserr, of Kooringa, informs us that on a recent visit to Waukaringa he was surprised to find work at the Alma Gold Claims was suspended.  The Manager, Mr Gowen, informed him that most of the hands had refused to work following the appointment of Mr McCuffray as captain.  The men then proceeded to the grogshop and then to the managerâ€™s office, where they demanded instant settlement of their claims.  The manager refused and Mr Gowen then had to protect himself with a revolver.  Some then pelted the place with stones.  The landlord and Mr Jackson, the storekeeper, tried unsuccessfully to pacify the men.  Mr Jackson was knocked down and had to protect himself with firearms.  The next day the mob demanded Jackson supply them with drink, threatening mischief if he did not.  New men arrived on 27 March and the manager contrived with difficulty to get the battery operating.  When the mail coach left for Burra about 25 of those making the disturbance went with it.  Police protection was asked for, but not granted.  The nearest police station is 25 miles away and the officer in charge was collecting census forms.
