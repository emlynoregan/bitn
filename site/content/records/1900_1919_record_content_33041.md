Obituary.  William Charles Berridge aged 17-18 shot himself with a shot gun on Monday morning at Wandillah Station belonging to Mr E. Bowman.  The deceased had just received a letter and had seemed upset by it.  An enquiry by S.M. Lane JP concluded that death resulted from a self-inflicted wound whilst in a fit of temporary insanity.

[Born William Charles Godfrey Berridge 28 May 1895 at Port Adelaide: death registered as William Charles Godfrey Berudge 11 November 1912 at Wandillah near Aberdeen aged 18.]
