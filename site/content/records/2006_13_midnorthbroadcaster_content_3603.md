Mrs Celine Stockman has decided to retire from being a Justice of the Peace in Burra after recently turning 70.  She was appointed a JP in 1982 and many times sat on the Bench at the old Burra Court House in Burra North.  It was required for a woman to sit if a child was involved in a case.  Mrs Stockman was part of a group of ten involved in starting the Mid North Justice Association.
