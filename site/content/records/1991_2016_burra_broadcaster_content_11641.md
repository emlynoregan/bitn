Letter.  Vicki & Roger Hamblin & Graham Swingler write re damaging rumours circulating about the – Empire Road Pty Ltd trading as the Royal exchange hotel.  They say:

When we left the town we paid all outstanding debts including rent, to all local businesses and Adelaide based companies.  If the rumours do not cease we feel we have no option, but to take legal action.
