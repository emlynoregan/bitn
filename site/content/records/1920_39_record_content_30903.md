Sheep Mauled & Killed.  M.J. Marchant had 35 sheep mauled by dogs on his property at Hanson last Wednesday morning.  Four sheep had to be killed at once and five more are likely to follow.  Two large lambs also died.  The destruction amounts to at least Â£50 worth.  Last year he lost 7 and the previous year 5.  He has reluctantly laid poison (reluctantly because he is near a stock route).  Further lambs are expected to die.
