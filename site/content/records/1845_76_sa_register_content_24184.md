Burra Mine

The half-yearly report has been released prior to the meeting later this month.  Though the new works are not completed, the raising of ore has recommenced and 257 tons of the 352 raised since last March have been sold, with 95 tons on hand.  In six months 36,762 tons of stuff have been tipped; up 20,000 tons on the last half year.  The railway has been carried into the mine to Stock’s Shaft and Graham’s Workings.  The recently erected dressing apparatus turns out five classes of ore.  Machinery for processing the orey sand accumulated in the Burra Creek has arrived.  Tenants are renewing leases.  Revenue from ore in the half year was £1,838 plus £857 from rents and interest.  Expenditure was £13,911.
