Telephones.  The charge for 100 miles is 1/4 and for 101-150 is 1/10.  Burra is 103 miles.  With those about to be connected there will be c. 45 phones in use in the town.  We think Council should point out the injustice of 6d for the extra 3 miles.  Does Petersburg pay for 200 miles because it is 154Â½ miles from Adelaide?
