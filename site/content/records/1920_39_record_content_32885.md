Burra Hospital Annual Christmas Tree

It is well over thirty years that this has been held and the festivities on 19 December surpassed all previous efforts.  Between 500 & 600 people attended the festival in the Hospital grounds.  This year arrangements were taken over by Mrs J.R. Barker & Mrs G.H. Dow assisted by Hospital Secretary Mr G.H. Dow.  There was generous financial support from the public.  The Institute Orchestral and Choral Classes provided the musical entertainment and seating for c. 350 was provided.  The decorations and lighting by Les. Pascoe of the Burra Electric Supply Co. were perfect.  The Mayor and Hospital Board attended.  [The musical presentations are then described.]

On behalf of Burra Red Cross Mrs W.H. Sandland handed over a cot and Miss Bubb for the General Aid Society presented 12 electro-plated trays for use by patients with egg cups, spoons and vases.  Gifts were then distributed to patients and staff.
