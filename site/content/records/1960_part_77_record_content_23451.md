Burra Primary School.  The enrolment is 230: 114 boys and 116 girls, which is an increase of 14 pupils on last year.  There are 33 new enrolments in Grade I.  Miss Kathlyn Rayner from Teachers’ College takes over Grade I from Miss Reid.  [New enrolments are listed.]

A new Art Room has been established to meet the needs of the new Art & Craft Course in Primary Schools.  Water has been laid on and the oval seeded.  The new room will be completed at the school by mid-year, which will enable the school to set aside one room for a school library.

Burra Library held its AGM.  President Miss Eunice Tiver reported a successful year.  Elected were President, Miss Eunice Tiver; Vice-Presidents, Messrs W. Carpenter & P. Byrne; Secretary, R.W. Nankivell and Treasurer, H. Cornelius.  During 1969 the President reported they had taken out another box subscription and had added two new books each month.  The institutes Association presented 120 books and there had been private donations as well.  Membership was up 2 or 3. Subscriptions were 30/- p.a. and 4/- for juveniles.  The annual trading table brought in £52.  During the year all duplicate books were culled and a number of juvenile books were also culled.  Committee meetings were held monthly.  The committee greatly regrets the loss of Mr W. Lloyd and the departure of the Treasurer Mrs K. Treleaven, who has moved to Woomera with her family.  Mr H. Cornelius stepped into that role.
