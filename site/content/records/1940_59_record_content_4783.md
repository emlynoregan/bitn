RSL President’s Annual Report

Financial Members number 94; up 4 on previous year.  Financial position is satisfactory.  The Anzac Sports were run on 26 April in conjunction with the local Fighting Forces Comforts Fund.  The event raised £533 and of this we received £40.  The ladies ran stalls and catered for lunch and afternoon teas.  They raised £148.  The Queen Competition netted £244-9-9.

Poppy Day saw 400 poppies sold; double last year’s effort.  The Anzac Service was well attended and 45 signed the roll book.  The annual Church Parade was held in the Kooringa Methodist Church the same night.  There was also a service there for the National Day of Prayer.  The Armistice Day Service was also well attended and was broadcast through a set lent by Mr Jennison.

Smoke Socials have followed each of the socials held for departing soldiers.

The RSL VDC was formed in June.  We have co-operated with the Rifle Club Reserve and have sponsored the Fighting Forces Comforts Fund and the Family Welfare Bureau.  A new floor covering has been laid in the club room.  Thanks are especially due for the untiring work of Doug Keynes as Pensions Officer.

Pte Howard Edwards received a presentation of a watch and the usual parcel of comforts on Tuesday morning at Miss Decima Warner’s café.  He is the son of Mr & Mrs Wally Edwards of Kooringa; the third of their sons to enlist.  The Mayor presided and other speakers were W.R. Lee, Cr March, Cr C. Samuel and Mrs J. McGrath presented the FFCF parcel.

Sgt L.H. Thomas writes a letter of thanks on behalf of a group of men heading overseas:

We would like to thank the people of Burra and District for their support through the Council, the Ladies’ Welfare Club and the Comforts Fund.  Eve man on board the ship has had an issue of cake, chocolates, fruit or tobacco every day.  We are also grateful for the enthusiasm, kind words and gifts received when we left.  At present we are having hot and humid weather and are dressed in shorts and shirts.  We remain, yours sincerely, Sgt L.H. Thomas, C.J. Pengilly, Rod Liebeknecht, Alan Penrose, Eric J. Smith, F.G. Seaford, Cpl John H. Lovegrove, J.H. Hood, Jas. H. Robinson, R.T. Wilson, Claude Attrill, W.G. Robinson, C. Davey & R. Smith.
