Mr Dollman & Miss M. Halliday sang the duet I’m waiting for someone.

The Mayor then delivered his address, which was followed by Mrs Max Pearce singing The Star of Bethlehem.

Mr Glen Hawkes then spoke in support of the appeal and the Mayor read a list of donations already received, which totalled £108-14-0 along with promises to bring that to £136-14-0.

The Mayor then introduced Captain Naish of Clare, the District Recruiting Officer.

[The editor thought this inappropriate at a meeting with a specific objective.]

Captain Naish provoked a sharp response from A.B. Riggs when he said he thought people should hand in their rifles as a donation, rather than asking for compensation.  He said of 104 collected to date from Burra, only 14 had been given.

Mr Genders then spoke on the effort [which specifically is not stated] and thanked Mrs A. Tennant for her work in the War Stamp Savings Campaign and urged people to reduce their spending and put their savings into War Certificates or Stamps.

The meeting ended with the National Anthem.
