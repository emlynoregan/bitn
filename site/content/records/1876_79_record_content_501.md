Typhoid did not start at Paxton Square, as there were several district cases in the weeks before the first case there.

I attended only two cases, saw two others and heard of one more, making a total of five in the Square: Hewitson, Tonkin, McKenny (fatal), unknown and Morris.

None of the houses to my knowledge are overcrowded and some are the largest and best ventilated in the district.  The closets in the Square are in about the same state as they are everywhere else â€“ that is people do not tap them until they are obliged.

Not only is Paxton Square not a hotbed of disease, but there is less sickness there than in any other part of the district, as can be proved by names of patients and dates of illness.

In the recent fatal epidemic of malignant scarlet fever there was one case in the Square and about twenty in the district.

[Obituary: Lavinia McKenney, wife of William McKenney, died 26 May 1876 aged 32.]
