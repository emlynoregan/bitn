Burra Pony Club held their annual pilgrimage to the seaside recently.  More than 17 horses were transported to Wallaroo North beach where bareback riding along the beach and swimming in the sea was enjoyed.  The Christmas party in early December was well supported and some members got home very wet after taking part in the Burra Christmas Pageant.
