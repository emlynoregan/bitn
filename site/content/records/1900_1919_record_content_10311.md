Burra Town Council

Mr W. West manager of the Burra Mine wrote stating that the Directors of the mine had presented three blocks of land for burial purposes and asked the Council to take the necessary steps to get the land conveyed by deed of transfer.  [Since the Burra Mine had been sold by SAMA the ‘directors’ mentioned would seem to be SAMA’s directors rather than the Burra Mine Directors.]

The Town Clerk is to write to the Commissioner of Railways calling attention to the dangerous crossing near the railway station and the need to place a lamp at the nearby railway gate to the station.

Council resolved to plant a number of trees in North Ward and 63 in Kooringa.

The Mayor and Cr West are to attend to the placing of new streetlights.
