Burra Caravan Park

The Government has granted $5,000 subsidy on the new Caravan Park, which will cater for twenty vans on the opposite bank of the creek from the present park.  It will offer toilets, showers and laundry facilities and will also cater for tent campers.  The work is due for completion by 21 December next.  Annual income from the present park is $1,600 to $1,700.  The total cost of the new park is expected to be $12,000.
