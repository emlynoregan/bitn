Police Community Forum.  About sixty residents attended the forum in Burra Town Hall last Wednesday evening.  It was organised to introduce the two new police officers to the town; Michael Lymberopolous and Sam Parish and was addressed by Superintendent Scott Denny, the Yorke & Mid North Commander.  Both the new officers attended school at Clare and are no strangers to rural life.  Various policing issues were raised.  The question of the drug ‘ice’ was raised and Superintendent Denny said it was around locally, but was not particularly prevalent.  One of the biggest issues in the Yorke Peninsula and Mid North area was the poaching of livestock.
