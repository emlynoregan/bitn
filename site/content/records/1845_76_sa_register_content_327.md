The Monster Mine

The Directors of SA Mining Assoc. have returned to Adelaide delighted with their visit to the mines.  One hundred tons had been despatched and twenty more drays were passed going up.  Seventeen drays arrived at Pt Adelaide yesterday and now 150-200 tons of ore are ready for shipment.

The site for a smelting house for comparatively inferior ore has been fixed and one street of the town has been laid out with sites for twelve cottages.

The first lode of Wheal Grey has been opened: 34 ft long by 27 ft wide and on Saturday it was 5 ft 7 inches deep.  The floor is a continuous mass of ore.

Stocks’s Lode varies from 8 to 11 feet in width and is 31 ft long.

Beck’s Lode is so far 17 ft long by 7 ft broad and 5 ft deep.

Graham’s Lode, Penny’s Lode and others are only partly examined.

The directors have opened a native spring about 1½ miles from the township.  It has been ascertained to yield 700 gallons of good water per day.  The directors brought with them some splendid specimens of ore.  Shares in the SA Mining Assoc. are changing hands at a premium of 220%.
