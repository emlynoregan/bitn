Kooringa, 27 May

Redruth Wesleyan Chapel held Anniversary Services on Sunday at which J.D. Hill preached to large congregations.  Tea and public meetings were held on the Queenâ€™s Birthday and were well attended.

Rain is much needed.  The last two days have been marked by dust and a dry, cutting wind.

A meeting was held at the Institute tonight to discuss the high prices charged by butchers for meat, but it was hastily arranged and matters were not prepared, so no definite results ensued.

At the Parliamentary Club on Tuesday F.W. Holder, the new Premier, outline matters to be brought before the Legislature.  He spoke for about an hour and the address was regarded as an excellent piece of elocution.
