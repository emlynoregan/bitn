John Newcomb (45) was charged with obtaining by false pretences articles from Charles Moore & Co. valued at Â£4-18-7 on 17 September.  He had represented himself as a lawyer practising at Quorn and passed a cheque that proved valueless.  Newcomb defended himself and claimed that it was a post-dated cheque, which constituted therefore no forgery, nor was it illegal.  He also claimed it was not illegal to set oneself up as a solicitor without being on the rolls as such.  The jury found him guilty and he was sentenced to 18 months hard labour.
