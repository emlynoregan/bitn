Mongolata

A collection of toys and books for the children of prospectors was distributed at a picnic last Saturday.  It was held in perfect wether at the local sports ground.  An after noon of sports was enjoyed by the youngsters and their parents.  Some children walked two miles for the occasion.

‘There are little folk out on parts of the filed so distant from each other that they rarely see or meet and endure hardships absolutely unknown or dreamt of by town children.  Some of their fathers work for rations and if they do happen to get a little return from ore raised the few shillings received from their arduous toil is docked by our generous Government from their next supply of rations therefore the glorious sunshine on Saturday last served a dual purpose, that of smiling on the afternoon’s fun and also providing warmth for some of their little bodies.’
