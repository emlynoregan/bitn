Rev. Wilfred G.M. Murphy writes protesting the letters condemning him in the last issue.  He says Miss Niemann admits to having been helped to write her letter and expressed regret for the trouble it caused.  Since ‘Commonsense’ could not have been the only other person present how could they write on the matter?  [The letter does not however, quite deny the substance of the original complaint, though it tries to cast it in a somewhat better light.  Murphy’s description of Miss Niemann as a servant at Mr Thomas’s comes across as somewhat patronising.]
