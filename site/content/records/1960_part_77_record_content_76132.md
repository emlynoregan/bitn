Ian Auhl & Denis Marfleet’s book Australia’s Earliest Mining Era is reviewed at length after its launch on 4 August by Warren Bonython at the SA Art Gallery.  Reproduced in it are 31 paintings by S.T. Gill, of which 24 are in colour and 15 concern the Burra Mine and Township.  The original paintings will be on display in the historical section of the SA Art Gallery in Adelaide for the next two months.  There is a specially commissioned review by Hans Mincham, which is more an outline of the contents and the life of S.T. Gill than a critical appraisal of the volume – though what there is in that vein is full of praise.
