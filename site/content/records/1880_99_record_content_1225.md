Joseph Bye, aged 8, was sent to the Industrial School, Magill, until 16 on the application of his mother.  She said he was uncontrollable and she was unable to prevent him from avoiding school, staying out at nights and stealing.  The bench remonstrated with her, but she persisted and they reluctantly acceded to her request.
