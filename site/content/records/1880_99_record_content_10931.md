Burra Town Council, 15 October.

The Mayor reported the waterworks poll results as above.

Attention was drawn to cab drivers plying for trade off the ranks.

The form of guarantee drawn up by the solicitors was adopted and 100 ordered printed.

Cr Geake asked if the Bon Accord water was wholesome.

Crs Brown and Rayner declared it to be ‘very superior water for all purposes.’

It was decided to apply for a copy of the Government analysis.
