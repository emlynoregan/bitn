Burra Town Council, 4 December

The Mayor addressed the letter from the Institute about the free use of the hall.  He said he did not understand what they wanted.  The solicitor had billed them 1 guinea for the letter, which he thought should be shared with the Institute Committee as they wanted the agreement.  The Committee wanted three days’ notice in writing for a meeting, which would not always be appropriate or possible.  They also wanted any money collected at such a meeting, which, if there were costs involved in calling a meeting would effectively mean the Council would be liable for Hall Hire.  He proposed a meeting with the Institute to discuss the matter.  Carried.

Discussion was also against a 1d special rate to support the Institute.

M.W. Bednall solicitor advised that Council could make what charge it liked for hawkers having stands in the street, but could not interfere with hawkers taking fruit and vegetables from door to door.

The Postmaster General is considering the request to have the name changed from Burra North to North Burra.

The Under Secretary writes concerning the sum of £400 advanced for a swimming pool and asking what progress had been made.  A meeting with the committee is to be arranged.

Subsequently it was decided to write a reply asking for an extension of twelve months as extra money to build the pool was still being raised.
