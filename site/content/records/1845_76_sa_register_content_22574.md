Rev. Lionel W. Stanton writes on the subject of the Redruth Church Funds.

[This refers to a considerable sum of money collected earlier for the purpose of erecting an Anglican church at Redruth.]

He says that the previous Thursday a letter had been published in which it was alleged that the interest from this fund had been paid to the minister instead of it being allowed to accumulate.  Mr Stanton, as minister at Kooringa for the past four and a half years, says as far as he is aware he has not received so much as a farthing of either its capital or its interest.  When asked about the fund he has always replied that he knew nothing at all about the fund and it did not seem to him to be his duty to meddle in the matter.  Now it seems it is necessary to clarify it as he is being accused of somehow being a ‘sharer in the spoil and particeps criminis.’

He writes:

‘I am informed by residents here that the Rev. Mr Ibbetson, of St John’s, Adelaide, and formerly “minister” here, is Treasurer and sole Trustee of this fund; if so I suppose he will at once give (as doubtless he can) a very satisfactory account of it, if only in justice to himself and his former co-Trustees.  Besides, as it is just possible a church may yet be required at Redruth, as “Beta” suggests, and it may become necessary to solicit further subscriptions, it is not unlikely that the absence of authentic information as to the whereabouts and whatabouts of this money may prejudice and injure the cause, which I presume Mr Ibbetson would be among the foremost in deprecating and lamenting.’

[Denzil John Holt Ibbetson died 10 August 1871 in Adelaide.]
