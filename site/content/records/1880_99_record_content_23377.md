District Councils of Burra, Hanson and Booborowie met last Friday in the Burra Institute to consider the Local Government Bill now before Parliament.  Thomas Fairchild presided.

The meeting:

Approves the general principle.

Believes the suggested shires to be too large and unwieldy.

Held that in the country from 4-8 of the divisions would be quite large enough in extent to form a shire.

Thought that more care was needed to group those with a community of interest.
