The mayor then read the letter sent to Cr Rabbich with the conditions he would not avail himself of.

The Mayor said the Council had been treated diabolically, especially in reference to the meeting held in North Ward, which had been called without asking him - he had felt slighted in the way they had gone about it.

Cr Butterworth denied any intention to slight either the Mayor or Council - it had been done on the request of North Ward ratepayers.

Cr Watt wanted the matter amicably settled.

Cr Rabbich said that Cr Watt was very submissive tonight, but at the last meeting had insulted him.

Cr Sampson then moved ‘That Cr Rabbich be now amoved as a Councillor from this Council, he having failed to show cause to the satisfaction of this Council why he should not be amoved and that his seat be now declared vacant’.

Cr O’Leary said he could not see any other move was possible and so 2nd.

Crs Parks and Watt concurred.

Cr Sampson said he [Rabbich] had not only reflected on the Council, but had vilified it in a letter to the Burra Record published on 4 March and he ventured to say he would not sit with him till he had apologised publicly.  The motion passed with only Cr Butterworth opposed.

The Mayor then declared Cr Rabbich’s seat vacant and ordered the Town Clerk to make the necessary arrangements to fill the vacancy.  The meeting was then adjourned.

An ordinary meeting immediately followed with Cr Rabbich still in his seat.

The mayor asked if he intended to withdraw and Cr Rabbich said ‘No.’

‘Then we will have to get the police to remove you.’

‘Perhaps you had better do that.’

Cr Sampson moved that Mr Rabbich be now asked to withdraw.  Cr Watt 2nd.  Carried.

Mayor: ‘Do you intend to withdraw?’

Rabbich: ‘No.’

His Worship then adjourned the meeting.
