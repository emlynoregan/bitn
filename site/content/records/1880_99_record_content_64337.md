Graziers Meeting: reported at greater length than in the editorial.  At the Burra Institute last Friday P.L. Killicoat took the chair.  There were representatives from the Hundreds of Eba, Lindley, Schomburgk, Stuart, King, Bundey, Rees, Tomkinson, Ketchowla, Bright & Mongolata as well as from the fringe country to their east.  Though unable to attend the Commissioner of Crown Lands wrote expressing his willingness to receive a deputation.  Sir Jenkin Coles reported his experience over the years.

1884	splendid	1889	good	1894	nothing at all

1885	bad	1890	good	1895	nothing at all

1886	bad	1891	bad	1896 	nothing at all

1887	fairly good	1892	very late & poor	1897	nothing at all

1888	very bad	1893	fairly good

They cannot continue to pay £2-13-4 per mile.  Vermin-proof fencing cost £40 per mile and no one will make that investment without security of tenure.  They needed a perpetual lease and not one subject to revaluation after 14 years because revaluation in a good year would be fatal.  Even 30 years ago with rents at 10/- to 12/- a mile no one was making a fortune!

J.C. Sandland said while £2-13-4 was average some were paying £3 or even £5 per square mile.  P.L. Killicoat thought that if no reduction was made they would have no alternative but to throw up the land.  T. Pearse moved that all rents on leasehold land outside Goyder’s Line from Morgan to Mutooroo, irrespective of the type of lease, be halved and a corresponding reduction be made in purchase money.  Carried unanimously.

H. Scott moved that any holder of grazing, cultivation, miscellaneous or educational lease if prepared at his own expense, or with Government assistance, to vermin-proof his land, be granted perpetuity of lease in lieu of his present leases.

A deputation was selected to wait on the Commissioner.

W.H. Hardy is seeking 10 persons to take £5 shares in a Central Australian Gold Mining Syndicate to open up and work a gold mine in the MacDonnell Ranges.
