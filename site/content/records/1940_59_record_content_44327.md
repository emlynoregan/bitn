Now the staff is adequate, but the group of school students pathetically small.  Why is it so?  Centralisation has taken families to the city.  Perhaps teaching methods have not kept pace with the changes.  Or is it in this age we donâ€™t need Christ?  These and other questions need to be answered if we are to preserve the Christian way of life.
