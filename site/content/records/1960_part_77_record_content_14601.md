Application to install petrol pumps adjacent to the main road at Terowie was refused and notice served on A. & F.T. White to remove the pump already installed.  (This followed advice from the Highways & Local Government Department.)

Request to C.B .Nourse, as owner of the lot, to remove the petrol pumps installed on the kerbside of MR 45.

SARâ€™s intention concerning the future of cottages adjacent to the northern crossing at Terowie (west of the cemetery) is to be sought.
