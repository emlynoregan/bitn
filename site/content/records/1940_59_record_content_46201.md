Council has found it more economical to buy crushed metal from the Ballast Quarry than to raise it and spread it itself.  With current costs the latter would work out at c. 30/- per yard compared with 11/1 per yard spread.  £150 worth of gravel is in storage.

Council has purchased the old Mine skimp dump with sole right of access, on a pay-as-you-go plan.  Council assisted with the erection of two new tennis courts at Burra North.  Last year’s plan of planting trees, selected by ratepayers, in the streets adjacent to their houses, provided the ratepayers agreed to look after them, has worked well and is being continued this year.  The Market Square garden is flourishing.  There was no convenient public phone booth in Burra and at the Council’s request a multi-coin machine was installed in Market Square last year and three letter boxes were also installed.

A Civic Reception was extended to Sir Charles McCann, the SA Agent-General in London, and to Dr Hargadene (Dr of Veterinary Science from Holland.)  A Civic Farewell was given for T.H. Woollacott and a suitable presentation was made in recognition of his long term as Mayor.  The Mayoress attended numerous functions in the district and opened many of them.
