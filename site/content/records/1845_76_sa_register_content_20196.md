Kooringa News, 15 February

The new process for roasting the sand in the creek so as to melt the ore and afterwards washing the sand away had a fair trial last week.  The new furnace near the Mine Store was heated gradually and charged with 21 wheelbarrows of sand from the creek.  After melting and washing it yielded 14%.  The process was repeated twice a day for the week and on Saturday the operations were suspended so that wages, fuel and other costs could be calculated to see if the process was profitable.  So far there has been no announcement.

Rev. L.W. Stanton gave an evening of readings at the Burra Hotel on Thursday 7 February.  The collection was to aid the Institute librarian Mr Cross whose trifling income is augmented in this way.  The amount realised was about £7.

The Wesleyan Mutual Improvement Association continues its monthly meetings comprising speeches, recitations, readings, songs etc.

Mrs Watts, who was charged with receiving stolen goods when her husband was arrested, has been discharged for want of evidence.

Prior to a change last Monday the weather has been intensely hot.  There was thunder and some refreshing rain with the change.

The Kooringa Branch of the SA Benefit Society was opened in Mr Fogg’s schoolroom on Monday last.
