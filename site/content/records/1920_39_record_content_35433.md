71 years ago on 29 September the foundation stone of the Bryanite or Bible Christian Church was laid as adherents had found their small chapel inadequate.  When the mine closed the church gradually became too big for requirements.  It could comfortably accommodate 600 and was well furnished with three blocks of seats. An immense gallery on the back wall alone could hold 200-300.  Many important gatherings of the Wesleyans and Primitive Methodists used it because of this capacity, especially for major Sunday school functions.  When the Methodist Union took place some 30 years ago this huge building was closed and eventually dismantled.  Some years later it was decided to demolish the structure, as the western wall was leaning out and a couple of Broken Hill miners* tried to blow it up.  Despite strong charges only the back and side walls fell leaving the front intact.  Last Saturday the present owner Mr W.H. Sandland decided to demolish it and a large charge razed it to the earth.  The foundation stone was located and this historic stone weighing about a ton was dislodged on Monday to reveal important papers including a perfectly preserved parchment.
