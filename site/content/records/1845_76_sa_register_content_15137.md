Obituary/Inquest.  This afternoon Mr MacDermott SM held an inquest on the body of George Pascoe who had been killed by falling into a quarry at Hampton the previous evening.  A. Motley was elected foreman.

Elizabeth Rogers:

Was the last person to see the deceased before the accident.  He came to our house between 7 & 8 p.m. to buy stores as usual.  It was not very dark when he came, but he stayed an hour and it was quite dark when he left.  He was not sober, but neither was he very drunk.  I advised him to take the road by the gully and not to go by the quarry, but he said he would take the old road.  I told him to take a light and turned to get a candle.  He was going towards the quarry and as I turned I heard him fall into the quarry.  I took the candle and ran down while giving the alarm, but no one seemed to come.  I called the deceased, but got no answer.  Found him head down among the stones with his legs up.  He was bleeding at the mouth and nose and I thought him to be dead.  I ran out of the quarry and gave the alarm again.  Mr Lewis came to his assistance and I went to get others.  I could scarcely tell if he was living or not for some time, but he finally died at 7 a.m. this morning.  Several men came and helped to remove the deceased.  The road he used was a little path beside the quarry and he always came that way when he came to buy stores.  The quarry was about thirty feet deep where he fell.  It belonged to Mr Tiver and had never been fenced.

[John Lewis’s evidence is essentially corroborative.  He adds that when he lifted the deceased he moaned and so he knew he was then still alive and sent someone to fetch a doctor.]

Dr Maurau:

Was sent for to attend the deceased between 9 & 10 p.m. last night.  Had difficulty in finding Rogers’ house in the dark.  Afterwards saw the deceased in this house.  He was suffering severe concussion of the brain and could not speak.  His eyes were insensible to light.  No bones seemed to be broken and there were few external injuries.  When I came again this morning he was dead.  I have no doubt death resulted from recent injury to the brain.  I identify the deceased as George Pascoe.  He was a widower and has left two sons too young to look after themselves.  The deceased smelled strongly of drink.  The jury returned a verdict of accidental death and expressed the feeling that steps should be taken to have the quarry fenced.

[SA Deaths CD records this death as George Pasco died 28 November 1861 at Hampton aged 40.  The evidence above indicates he died 29 November.]
