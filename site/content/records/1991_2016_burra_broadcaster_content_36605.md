Reece Van Gasteren has been contacted by a Dutch TV company to take part in a program called ‘KRO Memories’.  The program reunites people who tell of their memories of their first love.  Reece’s first girlfriend has been nominated and is unaware that she will be meeting him in the studio after 46 years.  Reece was 18 when he came to Australia with his parents in 1959 and he left his first girlfriend behind.  Although they corresponded for a while, they both eventually went their own ways, married and etc.  Now the TV Company has invited Reece to Holland to take part in the program.  It will be his first trip to Holland since migrating.  He and his family moved to Burra 26 years ago.  Since then he has worked in private enterprise, spent four years with Roche Bros. and the last 20 years with the Animal & Plant Control Board.
