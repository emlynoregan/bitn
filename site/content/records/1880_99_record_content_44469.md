‘Musicus’ writes expressing surprise at Mr Uhrlaub’s extreme reaction to his previous letter enquiring about the disposal of funds of the Mt Bryan Fife & Drum Band.  He did not consider his request in any way defamatory of Mr Uhrlaub and therefore considered Mr Uhrlaub’s reaction quite uncalled for.  He does not consider calling for a balance sheet casts any slur upon Mr Uhrlaub and hopes the same will be seen soon and the whole matter amicably settled.
