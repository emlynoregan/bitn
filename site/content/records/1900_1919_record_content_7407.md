Archie McLagan was brought to Burra as a child and being the only one in the family received great attention from both parents.  He was a clever scholar and received a college education.  He was noted for his geniality, courtesy and general good conduct.  Both parents are dead and his aged aunts most shocked.

[He must have been the child of the architect Mr George McLagan and his wife was the principal of Burra High School, conducted at ‘Bleak House’.  The principal of Burra High School in 1902 was one of the shocked aunts, Miss Annie B. Millar.]
