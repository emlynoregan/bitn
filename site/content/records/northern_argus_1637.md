D. Rayfield writes to the editor re the Burra rates.

The rates have not risen by 7.64% - in fact the average house owner in Burra has had a rate rise of 15% and in other towns of 14.28%.  The increase for many commercial properties is far greater â€“ 50% or more. This far exceeds the inflation rate, which is currently about 8.3%.
