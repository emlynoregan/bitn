Burra Primary School

The medical Officer of the Education department has reported that 30 students at the school are under-nourished, something he discovered in a routine check-up some time ago.

Dr Christie of the Education Department’s Medical Services has made recommendations that will result in the State Children’s Welfare department interviewing Mr McKenzie, headmaster of the school.  With high wages and plenty of employment, under-nourishment is probably brought about by laziness on the part of parents, giving the child 6d to buy food instead of cutting a nourishing lunch and the child then spending the money on lollies and ice cream.  Anyway, it is the duty of parents to see that children are not half starved, as apparently 17% of Burra Primary School children are.
