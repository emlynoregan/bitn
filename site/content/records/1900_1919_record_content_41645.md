Belgian Flag Day next Monday. (Public Holiday)  It is expected that at least 30 cars will take part.  (There were only 20 at Pt Adelaide.)  Also decorated traps.  Robertson’s motor lorry will lead carrying the Burra Coronation Band.  Even the boys are at it – some have dug out the old mine fire engine and are decorating it.
