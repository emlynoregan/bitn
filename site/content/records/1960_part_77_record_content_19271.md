Burra Hospital has installed an oil-fired boiler to supply 270 gallons of hot water per hour for the new laundry and all other requirements.  It replaces an inadequate coke boiler at a cost of Â£1,505 (subsidised on a two for one basis).  The old boiler was left in place and so the hospital was without hot water for less than four hours.  There is a 500 gallon tank for oil.
