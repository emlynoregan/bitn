Need for a Burra Pool

Only 14% of Burra School Children can swim.  The acting supervisor of Physical Education Mr C.A. Brooks will attend the public meeting on a swimming pool on Friday and will show a Learn to Swim film.  Some fear that the burden of maintenance would fall on the ratepayers, but the admission charges will cover that and it would be kept clean.
