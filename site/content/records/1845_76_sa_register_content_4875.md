Inquest/Obituary.  The inquest before W. Lang on the body of Frederick Lester is reported.

It was held at the Burra Burra Hotel on 12 August.

Samuel Pearce aged 14 was employed by the deceased to drive one of his teams.  Deceased and he had started from the Smelting Works with two drays of copper to take to Port Wakefield.  Deceased had complained of feeling giddy and had leaned his head against the fore part of the dray as it was going along.  Witness was driving the first team and, finding the dray driven by the deceased had stopped, he went back and saw Lester lying face down on the ground.  There was a wheel mark across his back.  He was quite dead.  Two men on horseback came along and rode into Burra, which was about three miles away.  Deceased had often complained of dizziness to Pearce.  He was not intoxicated, but a very sober man.  He had drunk no spirits and took none with him.

John Coles, Northern Districts Ranger, had come upon the accident and took the news to the police barracks.

William Parr Hill said he was requested by the brother of the deceased to examine the body.  He found contusions and broken ribs, which had undoubtedly punctured the lungs. The passage of a wheel of a dray carrying two tons of copper was sufficient to cause death.  The verdict was ‘Accidental Death’.

Herbert Lester, the deceased’s brother was dissatisfied with his brother’s body being placed in an outhouse and not in the hotel.  Mr Mortlock [of the Burra Burra Hotel] said the hotel was full and he had given all the accommodation in his power.  [Frederick Lester died 10 August 1850 aged 37.]

The jury expressed great dissatisfaction that, under the new Act, 24 tradesmen had to be called from their business to attend this inquest.
