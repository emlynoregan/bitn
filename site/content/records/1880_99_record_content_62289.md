Legislative Council Elections: address to electors by Messrs Warren and Haslam.  Dr Brummitt presided over a small gathering of electors.

Warren:

Was for federation, as long as SA was treated fairly.  Opposed free, secular and compulsory education.  Mainly it was the secular aspect he disagreed with as he believed its injurious effects had been demonstrated in Victoria and France.  He favoured free education but also in church schools for those who wished it.  He was against any reduction in the franchise provisions for the Legislative Council.  He would rather see it abolished than have that.  He was for the construction of the Central Australian Railway as proposed by the Anglo-French Co. with the line constructed in sections, all of iron and steel to be made in the colony and to employ only white labour, in return for a 99 year lease on lands to be fixed by a committee of three Government and three company men.  [He also seems to have been against payment of members.]

Haslam:

Did not think they were taxed heavily enough.  He was for strict economy and the development of mining and agriculture.  Economy and retrenchment should precede any increase in taxation.  If times grew harder taxes should rise, but only for those in a position to pay and whether they should be on land, income or death duties he couldn’t say.  He favoured a reduction in the qualifications for the LC franchise.  For the fair representation of labour, pastoral, commercial and agricultural interests in Parliament.  But it would not be in SA’s interests if labour achieved a majority.  He generally favoured federation – if SA interests were protected.  He had supported the State Bank’s foundation, but now regretted it.  He thought something had to be done soon about the NT.
