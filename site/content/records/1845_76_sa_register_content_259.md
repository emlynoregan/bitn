Important to Our Mining Proprietors

A reprint of an article in the Maitland Mercury (NSW)

Since our last we have been informed that some owners of copper mines in SA have found the heavy costs in transmitting their ores to England for smelting makes a heavy inroad into their profits.  They are anxious to see whether they can be smelted in the colonies and what facilities the port of Newcastle offers for the smelting trade.

England is about 15,000 miles away and Newcastle about 1,500.  The cost to the latter should represent a saving of about two thirds, as there would be return cargoes of coal.  (As happens in the case of ores transported from Cornwall to Wales.)  At present most ships come to Newcastle in ballast, but a different deal would be struck for ships bringing ore one way and returning with coal.  Other return items from Newcastle could be cloth, tobacco, leather, salt, soap, pottery etc.  Slate could also come from South Australia to Newcastle, as at first full cargoes of ore might not be available.  Newcastle Harbour is of easy access and admits the largest vessels.  Smelters could be erected close to the wharves.  Newcastle has unlimited supplies of cheap fuel.  A market for copper could be found in India.

[The Register observes that the Maitland author seems unaware that the supplies of wood fuel in South Australia would meet the vast consumption for some generations to come, even if South Australia does not find its own coal reserves.  The positive aspect of the article, it believes, lies in its desire to expand inter-colonial trade and develop Australian manufacturing capabilities.]
