Burra Races had a fair attendance at the postponed meeting held yesterday.  Heavy rain had made the track unsafe on the scheduled day of Wednesday last week. The main race was the Burra LVA Handicap with five starters.  It was won by Colincourt, owned by Mr Grundy and ridden by Jim Johnson.  [Other results are printed.]

Burra Rifle Club fired the fifth stage of the Kookaburra Trophy on Saturday, but it attracted only a poor muster of members.  Best score was from K. Heinrich.

Cricket.  The season opens next Saturday.
