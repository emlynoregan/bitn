The Year 1877. An Editorial summary of events.

The year began with the `Round Robin' protesting the rates assessment.

February and March saw major floods in the towns.

February. New Hospital opened

February. Foundation stone of Burra Public School laid.

March. Demise of the Burra Parliamentary Club

April. The Burra Races revived.

May. Move to see the Volunteer Movement established in the town, but this failed.

August. Ploughing match organised by the Show Society.

September. First Burra Show.

September. Closure of the Burra Burra Mine leading to depressed business activity.

November. The cessation of mine pumps leads to water shortages for stock, especially in Redruth and Aberdeen.

December. The survival of the Burra Rifle Club looks a bit debatable.

Hallett railway nears completion which seems likely to exacerbate

Burra's trade and employment problems.

The year saw the resolution of the much vexed question of the Eastern Road.

W.H. Pearce has made a good light travelling box. (Promotion of local industry)

Christmas_ again A. McCulloch of Princess Royal has delivered charitable gifts to the poor.
