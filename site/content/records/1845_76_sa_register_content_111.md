'LSD' writes on 'The Monster Mine of Twenty Thousand Acres.'

[He says there will be many opinions among investors about what to do with the mine and he lists such ideas as:

Work the mine extensively for maximum profit.

Work it on a modest scale.

Don’t work it at all.

Re-sell it immediately at a profit.

Re-sell it later at a larger profit.

His suggestion is to divide the area into 10 or 20 portions and dispose of half of them to speculators, recovering in the process the initial outlay of the original purchasers.

He then elaborates on how this proposal would work.]
