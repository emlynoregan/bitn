The Burra Jubilee 150 Float has been dismantled and stored at the railway goods shed in Burra.  It officially belongs to the Burra Burra DC and hopefully will be reassembled for the Copper Festival and possibly for Cornewek Lowender Festival 1987.   Sections of it would then take up residence at the Bon accord Museum.
