Central Road Board

Messrs Everard & Bright reported on their inspection of roads in the North District.

[Considerable detail is printed for each day’s inspection.]

25 July	Gawler to Tanunda via Lyndoch.

26 July	Gawler to Kapunda via Grotegut’s, Sheoak Log and Greenock.

27 July	Kapunda to Kooringa via Marrabel and Black Springs.

Kapunda to Summerhill.  The road is made and is in fair order.

Summerhill to Hamilton.  A fair road – the greater portion metalled.

Hamilton to Marrabel.  Mostly metalled.

Marrabel to Waterloo.  Passable with a cutting required at Pickering’s Hill.

Black Springs to Sod Hut Ranges – natural road – very fair.  Macnamar’s contract of 2¾ miles is proceeding satisfactorily.  Beyond that two miles should be made and the surveyor has funds for that purpose.

At Kooringa about ¾ mile in the township should be made at once as it is in a bad state.  This would also afford occupation for men out of work.  The bridge at Redruth, constructed by the Board some time ago, is being greatly damaged by the silting up of the creek due to mining operations.

28 July	Kooringa to Black Springs and Saddleworth to Riverton.

29 July	Sunday at Riverton.

30 July	Riverton to Rhynie and thence to Auburn.

31 July	Auburn to Clare.

1 August	Clare to Bungaree and return.

2 August	Clare to Auburn.

3 August	Auburn to Templers.
