History Week in Burra

Two of Burra’s major historic buildings are turning 150 this year and the event will be celebrated in History Week.  The National Bank on Market Street and the Bon Accord Mine Buildings are 150 years old this year.  The Burra History Group will mark the occasion with a photographic display in the Town Hall from 22 to 31 May, open daily.  On Saturday the Burra Branch of the National Trust will stage a free family day at the Bon Accord Mine Buildings.  The first bank in Burra was a temporary branch of the National Bank which opened in 1859.  Before then payment at the Mine was by money orders.  The bank still trades in Burra from its premises erected in 1862 to a Georgian design, possibly by Edmund Wright.  It reflects the prosperity of the mining town at the time and cost the then substantial sum of $3,000.

The Bon Accord Mine site contains buildings from two different eras representing very different functions: coper mining and the town water supply.  The Bon Accord Mine site was acquired in 1846 by speculators from Aberdeen, Scotland.  Despite hopes that the Burra Mine’s rich lodes would persist to the north, no ore was discovered and by 1849 mining had been abandoned.  Another attempt was made in 1858 and in 1859 mine offices, a blacksmith’s forge, a carpenter’s shop and a manager’s residence were erected.  These buildings survive.  This mining venture also failed and work was stopped in 1862.  Between 1884 and 1905 the town’s water supply was obtained from one of the Bon Accord Mine’s shafts.  From 1905 the pumping of water moved to the mine’s main shaft and buildings in wood and corrugated iron were erected there.  This remained the town’s water supply till 1966 when Burra was connected to the Morgan-Whyalla pipeline at Hanson and was supplied with River Murray water.  Since 1977 the Bon Accord Mine Site has been owned by the National Trust and now houses a mining display and the manager’s residence is available as visitor accommodation.

The paper also reports the Burra Record’s article from 4 November 1958 on the Centenary of the National Bank and the 99th anniversary of its establishment in Burra.  The Advertiser of 6 May 1859 page 3 reported that the opening of the National Bank in Burra had been a great success and had improved the circulation of money in Burra.  Cash had replaced the money orders from the mine and the smelting works.  It was reported that nearly all the principal tradespersons had transferred their accounts and savings to the bank.  The affability of the manager has also tended to the success of the ‘Little Bank’.
