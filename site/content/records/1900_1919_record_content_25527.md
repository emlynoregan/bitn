Leighton Hall was opened on 24 November by Hon. J. Lewis MLC, before a large crowd.  He had known the area for 47 years – from a time when there was but one fence as a dividing boundary.  Mr Bailey and Mr Gillett were the first to take up land after the survey, but eventually as conditions changed other settlers came in.  Of late closer settlement had seen the cutting up of the large estates and there were more farmers and more wheat, giving more revenue to the state.  He saw old friends like Mrs McDonald – an early settler of Leighton.  He had not realised how large the Hall was and he congratulated the committee and the contractors.  The committee had collected about £140 and the balance had been met by local guarantors.  The crowd was so large they could not all fit inside the hall.  The usual series of votes of thanks followed.  The site was the gift of the Education Department and vests in four trustees, while the building is 43’ x 23’.  The hand-dressed stone at the front reflects well on the mason, Mr Giet.  The ceiling is Wunderlich steel and a movable 16’ x 9’ stage is provided and a new piano with chairs and forms.  The first concert was under the supervision of W.J.C. Ewins and a ball followed.  Over £12 was raised.
