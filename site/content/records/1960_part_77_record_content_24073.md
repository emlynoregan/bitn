Burra Burra Show Inc.

Report of President Mr Rex Warnes

The last show was on 12 October 1964.  Conditions were shocking.  It poured with rain from morning to late afternoon, marring what deserved to be a record day.  Gate takings were down £30.  The Governor Sir Edric Bastyan and Lady Bastyan attended and his Excellency opened the show in heavy rain, making light of the circumstances.  After lunch he toured the soggy grounds and inspected the exhibits.  The Police Force Band attended, but rain prevented them from playing after lunch and they left.  Exhibits were of a high standard and numbered 2629.  Membership has fallen by 30 and this needs to be rectified.  Generous donated [from people who were listed] have helped to reduce the society’s overdraft.  Young’s Caterers of Melrose did an efficient job.  During the year death removed some staunch supporters in the persons of Mr W.H. Lloyd (a Past President), Mr C.T. Beckwith and Mr M.A. Radford.  Mr Lloyd and Mr Beckwith were both Honorary Life Members.

[The usual thanks to stewards and committees follows.]
