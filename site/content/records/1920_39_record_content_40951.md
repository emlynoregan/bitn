Burra Seaside Trip 13 February took place in good weather.  The train ran to time and went directly to Semaphore via Dry Creek.  They were met by the Mayor of Port Adelaide.  About half the visitors at once headed for the city to shops and a contingent went to the tennis tournament.  Others went to Luna Park at Glenelg.  Those at Semaphore had good weather for swimming and the sideshows were well patronised.  There were many reunions with former Burraites.  The train pulled in at 7.45 and Burra was reached at 12.20 a.m.
