W.B. Propsting, a former assistant at Burra Model School, has recently been knighted.  On leaving the Education Department he studied law, went to Tasmania and entered politics.  He later became Premier and Attorney-General.  Lady Propsting is a daughter of the late Sir Jenkin & Lady Coles of Kapunda.  [William Propsting was in Burra in 1879 and was a member of the committee that wrote the constitution of the Burra Mutual Improvement Assoc. in that year.  See Burra Record I. 36. 7 March 1879 Page 2.  He was only fairly briefly Premier of Tasmania from April 1903 to July 1904.]
