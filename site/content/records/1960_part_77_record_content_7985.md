Burra Hospital Annual Meeting 28 August

R.K .Pearse presented a comprehensive report.

Financially for the year the average daily cost per in-patient £4-1-0 (£4-5-7 in 1959-60) and for out-patients was 17/-.  Prompt payment of accounts attracts a rebate of 5/- per day and this has proved attractive.  No payment of accounts is the Board’s greatest difficulty and the Board urges all to join a Hospital Benefits Scheme.

During the year there were 428 patients, which averaged 11.9 compared with 11 in 1959-60.  There were 692 out-patients and 67 births.  The hospital greatly benefits from support of the community and a list of donations received is attached.  This year we are particularly grateful for a bequest from the estate of the late Clare Ethel Gare of £399-15-0.  The cropping program reached 90 acres despite a late start and we are grateful to all concerned.  We hope to double or treble this next year.  [Mr Pearse then lists a host of minor repairs and improvements.]

The use of the town’s hard water has a very detrimental effect on the hot water system and the boiler had to be replaced.  The Board decided to install a 50,000 gallon tank to catch all rain water, increasing the capacity to 130,000 gallons and this has been completed and will enable the usage of rain water only in the hot water system, which weekly uses 2,500 gallons.  Major improvements planned are air-conditioning in the Nursery, a new switchboard and rewiring of the hospital.  (Already commenced.)  Also, modernisation of the laundry, a toilet in the domestic quarters, a buzzer system and improvements to the grounds.

Staffing has improved and Matron L. Fyfe has proved very efficient and co-operative and we are lucky to have someone of her conscientiousness and ability.  The Board expresses its appreciation of all nurses and domestic staff.  Last December Mr M .Breen BA BEc Dip PA, who had been our secretary/manager for 18 months and who was responsible for putting our books in order, resigned to retire to Norfolk Island and it was with deep regret that we learned of his death only two months later.  Mr Harold Foote was appointed secretary/manager and has the full confidence of the Board.

The Ladies’ Auxiliary continues to give valuable assistance and the hospital is indebted to them.  The Burra & District Fund Raising Committee has been active and handed over cheques to the value of £459.  We are also thankful for the Burra Record for making available space for publicity for the hospital.
