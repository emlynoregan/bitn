Johnny Green is the focus of a mobile phone adventure entitled ‘Who was Johnny Green’.  It is a part-History, part-science and part-open air museum game and is played on 3G enabled smart devices.  The research, design, direction and field testing has been largely undertaken by a group of middle school students at BCS.  The adventure leads players through 13 different locations within Burra to help solve the mystery ‘Who was Johnny Green?’  Creative direction and project management was by Roger Edmonds, an educator specialising in online collaboration.  Regional Council of Goyder tourism officer Jess Humphrys has been a facilitator for groups with support from the Burra Passport Committee, led by Councillor Jane Kellock.  Text, audio, images and videos have been obtained from many sources, in particular from the State Library of SA and the Burra History Group website.  [Further details are printed.]
