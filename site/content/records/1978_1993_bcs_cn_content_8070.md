Burra National Trust has decided to call for the position of Warden of the Bon Accord Mine Museum and other sites.  The position would involve opening the Bon Accord Mining Museum on Saturdays, Sundays, Public Holidays and School Holidays from 2-4 p.m. and at other times for pre-arranged tours.

Also cleaning and general maintenance of the museum.  In return the Warden would receive tenancy of the managerâ€™s residence and half the admission charges.  Facilities exist at the site for the Warden to undertake a craft or art activity in keeping with the site.  One such activity would be that of a blacksmith as a fully operational forge is available.
