Mongolata Goldfield

Work has resumed after the holidays.

Rumour says a nugget weighing 4½oz was found on one claim last week and another claim further south is said to be on promising strata.  The battery is in full swing.  Ore from Terry’s Reward is being processed this week.  There are several new prospectors on the field and we hear more are going out.
