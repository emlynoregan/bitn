Jeff Hirschausen writes a long article concerning publicity for events happening in Burra.  He condemns both local apathy and the local paper’s lack of publicity.

The recent Burra-Adelaide Cycle Race – ‘even our substitute paper mentioned it after the event was run.’  It created no interest in Burra.

Hang gliding championships were held last weekend – mentioned in the Advertiser, but local readers had no advice in the local paper.  [And there is no report of it in this week’s paper.]

We boast about a Copper Festival and old building, but overlook what we have to offer sports enthusiasts.

We should also take part in the pleasures such visitors bring and so learn more about why people from outside the district are attracted.

[He ends with an appeal to Burra residents to look seriously at the town and ask if we are ‘just marking time with out historic heritage?’  Or ‘are we progressive?’

[The editor comments that advice about the cycle race arrived only the day before the event.  Arrangements were made to get a description of the race, but the official never sent it.]
