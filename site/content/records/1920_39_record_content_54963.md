Cr Dow move enforcement of the ban on playing tennis on the Kooringa tennis courts on Good Friday and Sundays.  [This was a tactical move because it becomes apparent that while he may have been prepared to go along with Sunday tennis, he was strongly of the view that Good Friday was the very basis of Christianity and no sport should be played on that day.  The general hypocrisy over this issue can be traced through the Council for many years.]
