It was resolved to endorse the Clerkâ€™s decision to give Samin authority to enter the Mine area.

A letter is to be sent to the editors of the Advertiser and the News supporting mining operations.

Resolved that a meeting be arranged with three members of the National Trust to inspect the Mine area and arrange for the removal of historical items.

The fence [along the eastern side of Market Street] between Burra and Burra North is to be removed and cleaned and later a fence will be erected if required.
