Redbank Reserve will benefit from a $15,000 grant from the State Government’s Planning and Development Fund as part of a package to improve recreational open space areas across the state.  The grant will be used for internal signage, fencing, erosion control, and revegetation.  The Management Committee’s Robert Heading said they hoped to open the reserve in October.  Toilets have been ordered and a road constructed to the camping area and picnic ground.  Wildlife has been returning with emus, kangaroo and birdlife more abundant.  A further $15,000 was also recently announced for improvements at Burra creek Gorge to follow last year’s $15,000.
