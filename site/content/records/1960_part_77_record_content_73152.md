Mt Bryan Methodist Sunday School held its Anniversary Services last Sunday.  The preacher was Mr Graham Hancock of Saddleworth.

Booborowie Bowling Club.  About 200 visitors attended the opening of the new Bowling Club at Booborowie on Saturday in ideal weather.  The greens were opened and the first official jack was rolled by Mr Claude Allen MP, Member for Frome.  The first bowl was sent down by Fred Dinham.

Burra Scouts had a trip to Blanchetown at the weekend of 19-20 October.  Each had a flight in a Sail Plane at the Armstrong Air Field.  A successful meeting of Cubs was held at the Burra Show Hall on 18 October when about 24 boys, mostly first-timers, attended.

The Veteran & Vintage Motor Cycle Club of SA will visit Burra 9 November.  [Likely vehicles coming are listed.]
