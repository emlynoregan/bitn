Burra Town Council, 4 March.

The Commissioner of Public works has written that there were arrears on the Waterworks of Â£210-14-2 and if the Council would pay that sum the new lease would date from 1 January last, otherwise it will date from 1 July next.

The sum represents uncollected rates for the last half of 1888.

The Council resolved to have nothing to do with the arrears.

The Mayor thought it a very cool request.  The Department having allowed the arrears to accumulate then expected the Council to advance the moneys that they might never recover.  There were strong complaints by the Councillors about the destruction of trees by cows and horses, especially in Welsh Place.
