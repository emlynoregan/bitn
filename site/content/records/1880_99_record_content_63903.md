Railways.  Some time ago a railway worker at Hallett named Minahane died, leaving a wife and four small children totally unprovided for.  The district foreman at Burra, Mr Queale and the stationmaster at Hallett, Mr H.H. George, organised a subscription over the Great Northern Line and the Midland System and have raised over Â£75 which has been banked and will be advanced to the widow in instalments as necessary.
