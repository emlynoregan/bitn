‘Tango’ writes about learning with regret of the demise of the Kit Kat Klub due to lack of interest.  Last year the dancing and good company was enjoyed, but this year there were only 15 replies from 130 invitations.  The writer says people are doing ‘what too many in this town seem to do – I mean leaving it to a few to push the business.’

‘The club fills a well needed vacancy in the night life of the town and undoubtedly is the type of attraction and entertainment to stem the lure of the ever demoralising pair of evils DRINKING and GAMBLING, - and to assist in the fostering of the good fellowship of the “younger set”’.

Mr E.C. Collins has perfected a crow trap that is more humane than poisoning and equally effective.  He has a square enclosure 5 ft in height of wire netting and inside is hung a portion of meat.  Access is through a long slot in the roof wide enough to admit a bird, but too narrow to allow for a bird on the wing to fly out.  On day’s catch accounted for 33 birds.

Football.  Spalding 7-17 defeated Kooringa 7-14.
