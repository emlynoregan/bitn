Editorial.  The editor draws attention to the recent reports on the less than encouraging indications for mining copper at Burra, but adds that there is also a statement that work by the Mines Department and Mines Exploration Co. gives promise of $30 million worth of copper could come from redevelopment of the upper part of the old mine.  But if this development occurs and disturbs old mine buildings, shafts, etc. would we want to see an activity that lasts just long enough to destroy a tourist industry that could be developed permanently?
