Murder at ‘Studholm’

A shooting tragedy has occurred at Mr R. Phillips’ property of ‘Studholme’ 13 miles east of Burra on the Morgan Road.  Lance Phillips, son of R. Phillips is dead and the 23-year-old housekeeper, Lillian June Mattner, is in Burra Hospital with a serious wound in the abdomen.  Leslie Harols Weiss, 28, a woodcutter of Mt Mary, has been charged with murder and has a bullet wound in the foot.

The evidence given at a bedside enquiry on Thursday afternoon reveled that Weiss rode his bicycle from Mt Mary for some 35-40 miles and then walked the rest of the way to the Phillips’ homestead, arriving c. 10 a.m.  There he told Lillian Mattner that he wanted to talk to her.  She walked away from him to the kitchen, where she turned around and saw Weiss raise a gun to her.  Lance Phillips had been sitting near the window and on seeing Weiss raise the gun, jumped between her and Weiss.  The gun was fired and the bullet passed through Lance Phillips and struck her. Lance began to crawl towards the bedroom, but died near the doorway.

Lillian Mattner said she had been keeping company with Weiss for sometime before Christmas, but was now contemplating marrying Phillips.  Weiss told her that if he couldn’t have her nobody else would.

After the shooting Mattner said Weiss put his arms around her and tried to get her to go away with him.  Later they both walked outside, where she collapsed.  Weiss then carried her back and bathed her wound.  He said he was going to shoot himself in the foot and left the house, saying also he wanted to leave quickly because the police would put blacktrackers onto him.

Weiss cross examined Mattner and accused her of saying she deserved the bullet more than Phillips had.  Mattner denied that.  Weiss also asked why she had apologised to him for all the things she had done in the past.  Mattner replied that she was frightened because he had a gun and a sheath knife.

The first news of the shooting was received in Burra when Weiss walked into the Burra Hospital at about 12.40 p.m. and called for the Matron, a doctor and the police before collapsing.  While his foot was being dressed, he said there was a wounded woman at ‘Studholme’.  Dr R.C. Heddle and MC Sparrow hastened to the property and informed MC France of the tragedy from Mr J.G. Rooke’s telephone (about 10 miles out).

Dr Heddle pronounced Lance Phillips dead and conveyed Lillian Mattner and her 3 or 4 year old daughter, who had been in or near the house the whole time, to the Burra Hospital.

MC Sparrow arrested Weiss during the afternoon and a post mortem shoed Lance Phillips had been shot just below the heart.  Weiss had been given a lift into Burra by a man in a buckboard, believed to be Mr Harold Davies of Stonehut.  A search by a large body of police recovered an old .303 rifle hidden in a rabbit burrow, three empty cartridge shells, a torch and the bicycle.  On Friday they also found a sheath knife.

At the time of the shooting Mr R. Phillips had been away from home droving sheep to his property.

Some two or three years ago the Weiss family was quiate well known in Burra as vendors of Murray fish on market days.  [In various places the spelling of the station varies from Studholm to Studholme.]
