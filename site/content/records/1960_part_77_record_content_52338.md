C. Leslie Phillips writes to urge participation in the poll of ratepayers on the intention of the Council to borrow $75,000 for building at the Town Hall.  He says he considers the Town Hall as belonging to the whole district in the same way that the Hospital, Schools, Swimming Pool, Showgrounds and churches etc. do.  All the fine buildings of the town were built at a time when many must have doubted whether the time was opportune for the expenditure: ‘surely our generation has not become so selfish that we want to accept all the benefits handed down to us and put nothing back.’
