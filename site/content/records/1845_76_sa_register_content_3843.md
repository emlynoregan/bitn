The Kooringa Postmaster is also the Resident Magistrate’s clerk. This sometimes means business takes him away from the town and then the post office is locked and those seeking mail are disappointed.   A flagstaff and flag, as are used in Adelaide to indicate when his Excellency is at home, would be expensive and troublesome, but some sort of gong might be devised to be sounded when the postmaster is ‘At Home’.

At Kooringa there has been an almost daily series of weddings, but there is a dearth of firewood.  The advent of the great Smelting Company has seen timber cleared in all directions.

[There is a peculiar and unclear reference to the possible partial destruction of a row of brick houses of the Mining Company, apparently following Mr Stephens’s lecture on Sanitary Reform.  Unclear because the writer says the information comes from an informant who is often humorous.]

The slaughterhouses of the butchers are mentioned in terms of apprehension.

When flour was £10 a ton in Adelaide and cartage to Kooringa was £1-5-0 a 4 lb loaf of bread cost 7d.

Now that flour costs £12 a ton and the cartage is £3, a 4 lb loaf here costs 6d.

Prices of beef and mutton are down to 1d, 1½d and 2d, instead of 1½d, 2d and 2½d as they should be.

[The explanation of this is given in convoluted Victorian prose, but, if I have unravelled that correctly, it would seem that some rich tradesman can afford to sell below cost for a time to drive out honest traders, but the writer fears that once the honest tradesmen have been cut out, the townsfolk will find the advantage to be an illusion.  He encourages them to stick to the skilful and honest tradesmen.]
