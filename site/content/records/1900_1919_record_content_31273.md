Cpl Gibbons, who has been in charge of the Redruth Police station for almost 2½ years, has been promoted to sergeant.  He has served for 36½ years and has been in charge at Palmer, Mannanarie, Salisbury and Tanunda.  He is also Clerk of the court, Registrar of Old Age Pensions, District Registrar if Births, Deaths and Marriages and Representing Officer of the Destitute Board.  He has worked his way to this rank by sheer merit and is to be congratulated.  There are only 8 sergeants in SA.
