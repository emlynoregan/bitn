Locally we hope the mine will reopen.  We need a new railway station.  The Council should also ensure the continued improvement of the town.  He was in favour of borrowing to vastly improve the town.  In the coming year a major effort will be the enclosing and planting of the recreation ground, granted by SAMA.  There will be more tree planting.
