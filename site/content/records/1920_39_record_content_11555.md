Redruth Court, Monday

Arthur Harold Harrison pleaded guilty to having illegally in his possession a ladies gold watch – the property of Mr L.S. Grauhl of near Clare.  He had taken the watch some 2½ years previously when under 18 and working for Mr Grauhl.  Taking his age into account the bench imposed a fine of £5.
