Bitumen Road Broken Hill to Mildura

There are strong moves to seal this road and if it were to happen Adelaide would lose much trade and tourist visitors.  A bitumen road from Adelaide to Broken Hill is needed if SA wishes to keep both the tourist and general trade.

Miss Ola Pearce has been transferred from Burra Primary School to St Morris Infant School.  She has been at Burra for 30 years and some 900 pupils have passed through her classes.  A presentation of a travelling case and travelling rug and a card table was made on behalf of pupils and staff, by the headmaster Mr Pattrick.

Dean Bernhardt caught the top of his left index finger in the power mincer at Mr Jim Waters’ bakery on Thursday night and Dr L.G. Miller amputated the damaged part at the first joint.

Buffalo Lodge Annual Christmas Tree was held at the Rotunda on Thursday night, preceded by carol singing.  Father Christmas arrived on Mr E.T. Baulderstone’s gaily decorated truck.  He first (Mr Ern Hawke) distributed gifts at the hospital and then at the Rotunda.  500 children received gifts.  A dance followed in the RSL Hall.

Library Scholarship Winners for 1955 are listed.

Max Lockett & Judith James topped the Progress Certificate examinations at Burra Primary School.

Mr M.L. Archer of the ANZ Bank at Burra has been transferred to Pt Pirie after six years here.

Mr Ferenc Fluck was naturalized at a ceremony at the Town Hall on Friday.  This was the first ceremony of this nature to be held in Burra.  Mayor E.T. Baulderstone conducted the ceremony and G. Stanley Hawker MP gave an address on Australian topics.
