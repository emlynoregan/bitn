Letter.  Dick Cleland write re the refurbishment of the Mt Bryan East School.  He is glad to have taken before and after photos â€“ though wishes that the render had been preserved, rather than removed.

[The context seems to imply that the render should have been preserved as an original feature of the building.  In fact the school was not originally rendered and presumably the render was added when the school was repaired at some point.  Its removal and repointing of the stone work would thus have been restoring the original nature of the exterior.]
