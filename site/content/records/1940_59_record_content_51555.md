Obituary.  Mr Harry Tiver, former resident and postal officer of Burra, died at Dudley Park on 10 August aged 73.  He was the eleventh child of the late James Tiver.  He is survived by a wife, two sons and five brothers and sisters.  He was associated with the post office when the Postal Department was connected with the railways at the Railway Station some sixty years ago.  When the two separated he chose to go with the Postal Department and served over the years as postmaster at Gawler South, Hawker, Cockburn and Crystal Brook, from which he retired and went to live at Dudley Park.  He was a keen poultry farmer and gardener and is believed to have had a good living from both until his final brief illness.  [Henry Tiver born 24 November 1877 Aberdeen: died 10 August 1951 Flinders Park.]
