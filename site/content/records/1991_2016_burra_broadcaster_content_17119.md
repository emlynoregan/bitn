Burra Ambulance Centre is being renovated and the ambulance bays and training room are both being enlarged by 3 m.  This will allow easy access to vehicles for cleaning and restocking and a safer working environment.  The construction is by local builders D.T. Jacka & Son and is funded by SA Ambulance Services Capital Reserve Fund and is expected to be completed in about six weeks.  In the meantime thanks are due to Howard Matson for allowing the use of the shed at his home to house the ambulances.
