Burra School Centenary

A large crowd attended for the occasion.  Mr Ian Allen extended a welcome and read a telegram from Ian Auhl, who was unable to attend and who was to have unveiled the plaque.  The Chairman of the School Council Mr Ron Thamm took his place.  The first students moved into the school in February 1878 and on completion of the renovations Primary School students should occupy the building in February 1978.

[A list of at least some of the visitors who signed the book for the occasion is printed.  Personal interest: among them were Frank McMahon, Dick Kearns, Edna Fuss nee Allen, Joan Fairchild, Clem Sampson, Rosemary Nairn nee Reed, Mavis Satchell nee Fairchild, Dorothy White nee Woollacott, Norman Allen and Bob Allen.]
