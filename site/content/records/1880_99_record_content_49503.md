Hardy v. Davey.

Material relating to this case was published on 3 Feb. 1892, 13 July 1892, 20 July 1892, 5 Oct. 1892 and 11 Jan. 1893.

H.R. Hill appeared for the plaintiff and J.H. Symon for the defendant.

The evidence is quite amazing and Hardy was mercilessly destroyed by the QC who also made mincemeat of Hill.  Early on it is clear that Symon is a very clever manipulator of technicalities and later an astute and quite ruthless exposer of a stumbling witness.  Hardy clearly had no idea what he was letting loose upon himself.  Some of Hardyâ€™s letters to Davey that are introduced in evidence scarcely seem to be those of a rational person.
