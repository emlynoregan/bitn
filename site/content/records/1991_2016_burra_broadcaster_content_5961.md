Burra Picnic Race Club is worried that the SA Jockey Club has suggested that registered horses will not be allowed to race at meetings like that at Thistlebeds after August 1995.  This would jeopardise the future of the meetings.  The reasoning is to exclude ring-ins.  A decision has been delayed until December and negotiations continue.  The next Thistlebeds meeting will be on 2 April.
