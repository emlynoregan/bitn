Burra Cheer-up Society.

The Adelaide branch of the society is having a big fair in the Adelaide Exhibition Building on 18 & 19 May and donations for a ‘Sing a Song of Sixpence’ stall are being requested (i.e. items to be sold for 6d.).  Parcels have been sent to soldiers unable to be at our recent social: Ptes Voumard (2), Kelly (2), Parker & L. Griffiths.  D. Kelly has written back with thanks.
