Leighton Hall held its annual meeting 14 November with President I.J. Warnes in the chair.  The hall was in good order.  The polo ground has been used this season and the croquet ground levelled and planted.  Expenses on the ground were £62 and revenue was £56.  The bank overdraft has risen from £168 to £180.  With the expenses now virtually finished we should be able to reduce the debt next year – considering that in 1930 we spent £160 on improvements.  Elected were President, I.J. Warnes; Vice-President, D.E. Williams; Treasurer, A.K. McDonald & Secretary, S.A. Pearce Jnr.
