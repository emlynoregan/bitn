Sparks Column:

Steam Circus in town.

Rounsevell for Speaker.

Cabs are leaving for the station too soon.

A lot of stray cattle about on Sunday.

Burra Mine not likely to work just yet.

Treasurer Holder expected back from Brisbane and Sydney this week.

Houses belonging to SAMA ‘are beginning to get worst for wear’. 

Rev. G.E. Rowe is recovering from typhoid fever.

The Terowie Enterprise does not support F.W. Holder.  We knew that long ago.
