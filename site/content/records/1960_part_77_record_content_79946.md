Burra Burra DC

The Council adopted last yearâ€™s assessment with necessary adjustments and increased the rates by 5%.

A general rate of 1.2 cents in the dollar was adopted with 12 cents in the dollar in the townships of Farrell Flat, Booborowie, Mt Bryan and Burra.  Payment by instalments can be applied for.  Work needed to enable the public toilets in Chapel Street to be re-opened will be done in the next couple of weeks.

BCS.  Site work for the new school is expected to begin in September.  Twenty to thirty men will work on the site until the beginning of the 1978 school year.

The 25th International Geological Congress in Sydney was preceded by a series of associated tours.  One of them in SA saw up to 80 leading geologists from overseas visit the Middleback Ranges iron ore deposits, Beltana willemite [a zinc silicate] and Burra copper deposits.

Seat of Eyre.  The Shadow Minister for Agriculture, Mr Graham Gunn, will seek Liberal Party endorsement for the newly created seat of Eyre in the House of Assembly.

BCS will act as a Recreation Centre in the school vacation 23 August to 27 August.  [Program details are given.]
