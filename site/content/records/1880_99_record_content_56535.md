2nd Leader on Council Proceedings.

The spiteful and unfair remarks which predominated from some councillors go to prove ‘that a body of men have emerged into positions who should never have filled them’.

Apparently two ratepayers exchanged some heated words and when Cr Hardy heard of it he took it upon himself to bring the matter before Council, which in the opinion of the Mayor and some Councillors was improper, so the report was rejected.  This led to an exchange of bitter and offensive words.

Hardy was prepared to drag Mr Launder into the mire.  It is well known why Hardy brought the matter into Council.  We have heard complimentary remarks for the way Cr Sampson drew attention to it and of the Mayor’s objecting to accept it.

The key issue is rather the spending of £20-£30 in Ware St where there is little traffic, while more important places have been neglected.
