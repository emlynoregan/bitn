Generally the paper remains a very good journal of record for the daily events and concerns of the town.  There is a strong editorial interest in the townâ€™s progress and a willingness to pursue a strong line in favour of an active role for local government as well as a desire to have people well informed about the activities, role and deficiencies of the government in Adelaide.  The editorials and leading articles must have been beyond many of the readers whose level of literacy could not have been all that high.
