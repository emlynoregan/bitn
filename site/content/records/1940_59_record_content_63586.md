Korean War.  Private Charles Martin was welcomed home to Hallett last week at a gathering in the RSL Hall on Tuesday night, at which Mr N.G. Tiver presided.  His parents, Mr & Mrs S. Martin, attended.  Mr S. Martin is a veteran of the Boer War.

[I can find no record of an S. Martin in the Records of Australian Military Contingents to the Boer War.]
