The coroner and a jury of six inspected the body at the Burra Hospital and then went out to Koonoona with the police, arriving at 3 p.m.  They surveyed the scene of the crime and the damage done by the shot gun at very close range.  The tracker was soon busy.  The inquest was opened at the house with the jury of F. Treloar (foreman), W. Hodge, a. O’Brien, T. McWaters, George Lord and A.J. McBride.

Clement Escott:

Son of the deceased, who would have been 70 next month, gave formal evidence of identity and the inquest then adjourned till 10 a.m. 25 March at the Burra Institute.

Christopher Fisher:

Was in the kitchen after tea with Clem Escott.  Mr Escott Sen. had gone to his office.  About 7.20 heard someone in the passage – not heavy steps like Mr Escott, thought it was Harold.  After the shot I rushed out from the kitchen around the house to the front and found Mr Escott lying on the ground.  It was very dark with no light in the office.  Mrs Escott thought it was best to let him lay where he had fallen.  She lit a lamp in the office and between 8 and 9 o’clock Mr Clem came home.

Clement Escott:

Left at 7.30 to go to G. Webb’s, a neighbour, about 2 miles away.  Came back between 8.15 and 8.30.  Turned out the horse and went to the stables to feed the draught horses before stopping the windmill and going to the house.  I found the door locked and my wife asked who was there.  They let me in and told me my father had been shot.  I went to Mr Kelly, a mile away and brought him back, covered father with a rug and went to Burra for the police.  Know of no one with a grudge against my father.

Harold Escott:

About 7.30 went to Black Springs to post letters and then to Mr McCarthy’s – 10 or 11 miles in all.  Returned c. 11.30 and went to the stables to feed the buggy horses and the one I had ridden.  Found the door locked and went to the kitchen, saw a light and went to the dining room and found Mr Kelly there.  They told me what had happened and we waited for the police.  I had been living at Echunga, but came home on 12 December and have been with the McCarthy’s for two months.  Don’t think father had a cross word with anybody in the district.  Have not seen any strangers about.  None of us went to bed that night.  About 1.30 a.m. my other sisters came from Burra.  About 6 a.m. I was going to Farrell’s flat to get my other sister and asked my sister to come to my room as I wanted to get my watch and was scared.  On entering the room I noticed a candle on the bed and one of my waistcoats on the floor.  My watch was missing.

[Some money was also missing, but the evidence as reported is not easy to follow – perhaps £42 in notes and some coins.]

On Thursday a double-barrelled breech-loading gun was found in a 65’ shaft by the tracker Alfred Ryan, who descended by rope and recovered it.

The funeral was on Thursday 18 March in unpleasant dusty conditions.

On Monday 22 March Harold Escott was arrested for the murder of his father, William Escott Escott.  The case was adjourned till 26 March and the Inquest reopens 25 March.
