Burra Town Council

Cr H.M .Scott said he had been told by Mr Ellis, a builder and contractor, that the SA Housing Trust was not interested in building houses in Burra and no contract would be let in the near future.  Town Councillors were incensed at this and if true it is another in the list of modern amenities denied Burra by the Government – others include good bitumen roads, water and electricity – despite the district producing a good proportion of the state’s wealth.
