The Premier was prepared to grant the request, but the matter had to go to the Railways Standing Committee.  The first time the matter was raised the estimated cost was £163,000 and it was thought it would not pay.  In 1922 the cost was estimated at £244,000, but he promised to put it to the committee again.
