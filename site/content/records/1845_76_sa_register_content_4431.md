Supreme Court of SA.  15 March.

Gottlieb Keirnall, convicted of the manslaughter of John Smith, was placed in the dock.

William Pohlman of the Hamburg Hotel in Rundle Street said he had known the prisoner for three and a half years. He had employed him for 15 months and was always satisfied with him.  Herman Grutegut of the Adelaide Hotel in Hindley Street had known the prisoner for three and a half years and had found him civil and quiet.

The judge said that he was glad Keirnall had not been convicted of murder, but nevertheless it was a most aggravated case of manslaughter and despite the provocation there was no excuse for the use of the axe.  Keirnall was sentenced to transportation beyond the seas for seven years.
