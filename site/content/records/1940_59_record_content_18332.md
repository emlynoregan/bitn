E.J. Davey is 75 on 27 July.  Mr Davey was first employed by Drew & Crewes, but later worked at Butterworthâ€™s Mill where the Shell Co. is now.  For seven years he worked as a miner at Broken Hill and then was in Melbourne for eight months before returning to Burra where he worked for 2 or 3 years at the Aberdeen Ballast Quarry and on the Railway Gang.  Later he went to the WA goldfields and worked on most of the mines on the Golden Mile at Kalgoorlie.  On returning to Burra he worked as a tributer in a mine for 2 or 3 years with Mr Bill Kellaway.  He was again employed by Drew & Crewes as a grocer, but later became a wheat buyer for Dalgety & Co.  In 1911 he became Town Clerk from Mr Steele who resigned and he has therefore been Town Clerk for 33 years.
