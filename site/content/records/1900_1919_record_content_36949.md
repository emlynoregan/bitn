Kooringa Methodist Church Closing Services.

Some months ago a report was ordered on the safety of the building which had served for 55 years.  On the basis of this it was decided a new church was the better option.  Subscriptions soon warranted proceeding with the new work.

P. Phillips of Burra won the contract to proceed with the removal of the old church and Mr Quinn of Hamley Bridge won the contract for the new building.  Rev. W.G. Clarke of Unley and late of Burra conducted the closing services on 4 January 1914.

[The closing sermons are summarised in c. 1 column of detail.]
