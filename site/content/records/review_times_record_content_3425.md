Jim Kelly the bullocky will feature largely in the Burra Copper Festival in October.  He will tell yarns on the bank of the creek, display his team of bullocks at the showgrounds, take part in the street procession and be at the start of the Gulf Road re-enactment.  He and Jim Lowe, a muleteer, will feature at the Bullockyâ€™s Breakfast.  Another part of the Copper Festival will be the 109th Burra Show.  [It was not the 109th show; see explanatory note 34, 2, 23 Mar. 1977, page 1.]
