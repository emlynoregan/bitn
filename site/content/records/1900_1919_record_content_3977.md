A Bolt.  A clap of thunder caused a horse of A.W. Clode to take fright last Thursday at the Reservoir Quarry.  It rushed down the hill and along a couple of streets with the chains dangling about its feet.  These eventually tangled it up just at the Black Bridge in Aberdeen and the horse fell and slid along the ground for 17 yards.  Amazingly it was not even scratched, though the collar was a little damaged.  The horse lay prostrate on the ground till released.
