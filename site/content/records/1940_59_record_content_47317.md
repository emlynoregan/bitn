The Colts Cricket Club held its AGM last night, but so few attended it was decided they could not field a team this year in the Burra Assoc.  They had played for the last four years, but always found it difficult to field a team late in the season.  This reduces the Burra Cricket Association to three teams, scarcely a viable number.
