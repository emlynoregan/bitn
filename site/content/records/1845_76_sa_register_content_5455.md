Accident/Obituary.  About a fortnight ago a terrible accident occurred to the wife of a labourer employed at the Smelting Works.  While cooking her husbandâ€™s breakfast, her clothes caught fire and before any assistance could be given they were burnt off her, literally roasting her body.  She lingered in great agony till the twelfth day.  The deceased was one of the Irish orphans recently arrived and had been married only about three months.  A collection raised to defray funeral and other costs has been carried off by her heartless husband, who has gone to Adelaide, leaving a kind fellow workman liable for the funeral and for a suit of clothes kindly lent that he might appear decently at the funeral.  It is to be hoped that justice will soon overtake this ungrateful scamp, application having been made to the Resident Magistrate for that purpose.

[The absence of names here means identification is not straightforward, but the following information is quite persuasive.  Marriage registrations for SA show a Fredrick Paterson married Bridget Ambrose on 5 October 1850 at Clare.  Bridget gave her age as 19.  On 17 December 1850 Bridget Patterson died.  She was then said to be 16 and her marital status was not stated, but the relative is said to be Frederick Paterson.]
