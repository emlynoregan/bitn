Kooringa Methodist Church held its 101st Anniversary on Sunday 10 October, with services at 11 a.m., 3 p.m. and 7 p.m.  Rev. J.P.H. Tilbrook preached at each service.  The poor weather reduced attendances somewhat.

On Monday the High Tea was served by the Ladiesâ€™ Guild at 5.30 p.m. and at 7.30 p.m. Rev. C. Pitman chaired a public meeting where reports on the past year were received and items were presented.
