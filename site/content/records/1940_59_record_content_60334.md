Obituary.  John G. Sara died at his residence at Burra North on Thursday aged 90.  He was born at Willunga 5 July 1863.  He remained an extremely active man both mentally and physically, as demonstrated last month, when after his 90th birthday he sat down and wrote 40 letters in reply to birthday greetings, some of several pages.  He was the second son of Mr & Mrs George Sara and came to Burra as a boy.  He began his education under the late Sir Frederick Holder in the private school which used to be situated near the Kooringa Hotel.*  His father was in partnership with Mr Dunstan, as building contractors.  They built the present Primary School and John Sara helped the plasterers and later attended the school.  As a young man he and a friend went to WA in the barque Ribston, taking three weeks to get there.  They stayed about 12 months, working in a timber mill and a flour mill.  On returning to SA Mr Sara worked as a miller at Quorn with Messrs Dunn & Co. before returning to Burra to marry Miss Emma Tiver in 1885.  She survives him.  The couple had two children: Frank Sara, who died six years ago and Natalie, who is now Mrs T.M. Carey of Melbourne.  After the marriage the couple went to Cockburn, where they ran a store and acted as forwarding agents for Messrs Sara & Dunstan before the railway went through to Broken Hill and goods had to be sent beyond Cockburn by bullock wagon.  After about seven months the railway was completed and the couple moved to Broken Hill, where they worked for Sara & Dunstan.  Later Mr Sara was time-keeper for the biggest of the mines.  They later sold out and went to WA where they conducted a business for 17 years.  In 1909 they returned to Burra and took over the business of Messrs Tiver & Sons, which they carried on with their son Frank until his death in 1947.  Mr Sara was then 84, but took an active interest in the business, which is now carried on by his grandson, David Sara.  Mr Sara was an active worker for Methodism and a local preacher.  He was a Rechabite and a member of the Masonic Lodge.  As JPs, he and Mrs Sara often sat on the bench together.  He had been a keen cricketer and was an assiduous reader.

[*The statement about his schooling is suspect.  Frederick Holder took over John & Eliza Stephens’ school in 1876.  It was conducted in the 1847 Wesleyan Chapel on a site to the rear of the present Burra Uniting Church.  Given John Sara’s age, he is unlikely to have started school with Mr Holder.  The Burra Grammar School was a different institution, housed in a building on the site of the Kooringa Hotel.  He may indeed have gone there.]
