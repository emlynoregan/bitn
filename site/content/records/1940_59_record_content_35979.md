Burra Cricket Association held a meeting on Tuesday about the Easter Carnival.  The Social secretary of the Easter Carnival 1947 says it was not a financial success due to the lack of support from local cricketers.  The dance in the RSL Rooms on Saturday night was poorly attended by players and 95% of dancers were non-supporters of the Cricket Club.  The trip to the Gorge on Sunday was accompanied by only seven people from Burra; three players and four supporters.  A Smoke Social in the RSL Rooms on Monday evening was attended by only 70 people when the catering had been for 100.  If local cricketers had supported the functions they would have been profitable.  He hoped for better with the 1948 Carnival.
