The Anzac Service at Burra on Sunday saw a smaller attendance this year.  Before the service the Pt Pirie Piper’s Band played at the Burra Hospital between 12 and 1 p.m. At the service at the Memorial 86 ex-service personnel were on parade led by Burra RSL President H. Cornelius.  Rev. R.S. Jenner gave the address, which is printed in just less than 2 columns.  The march went from the RSL Building up Commercial Street to Kangaroo Street and returned to the Memorial.  W. Kotz & M. Burt were pallbearers.  Wreaths were placed by H. Cornelius (for the RSL), T.R. Rogers (for the Air Force Assoc.), Mr Arnold Heinrich (for Demobilised Soldiers), W. Carpenter (for the Fathers’ Assoc.), Mayor E.T. Baulderstone (for the Town Council) and Chairman A.D. Radford (for the District Council).  Flag attendants were H.L. Riggs and J. Lockett.  There was an evening service at St Mary’s conducted by Rev. T. Drought and a collection for Legacy.  He also conducted an Anzac Service at Booborowie Hall on Sunday at 3 p.m. with a lesson read by local RSL President Barry Dinham.
