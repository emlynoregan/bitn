Accident/Obituary.  Three people died when two cars collided near Hallett on Sunday evening.  Of three people injured, one is in a critical condition, another is serious and the third is satisfactory.  The accident occurred about one mile south of Hallett.  A sedan car driven by H.R.

Gurr died almost immediately.  From the other car Mr Edwards died shortly after being admitted to Burra Hospital and Mr Collins also died in the Burra Hospital.  All three of the deceased suffered multiple injuries, including fractured skulls.  Wayne Gurr (13) received head injuries and Deidre UNREADABLE of Nailsworth is in a critical condition.
