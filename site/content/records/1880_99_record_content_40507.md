Burra Town Council, last Monday.

The Mayor reported a meeting with Mr Lewis who assured him that a pacific settlement of the difficulty would soon be brought about.

Cr Rabbich asked if Mr Lewis had decided to remove the obstruction in the watercourse through the sheep yards.

The mayor said he had received some correspondence on the matter which he would read later on.

The mayor asked Cr Rabbich if he would, by the indulgence of Council, explain why he left the Chamber so abruptly at the special meeting of Council the previous week.

Cr Sampson said Cr Rabbich could only make a personal explanation.

Cr Rabbich said he had no particular desire to make an explanation and he would not ask the indulgence of Council, but if the motion passed at the last meeting compelled him to explain he would willingly do so.

Cr Sampson said before Cr Rabbich did explain he would move that the Council go into committee and all strangers leave.  Cr Watt 2nd.

Cr Rabbich objected that he was not ashamed to have the ratepayers know what he had to say.

Cr Sampson objected to further action before the motion was put.

Cr Rabbich asked if he was not afraid to have his words reported why did they wish to clear the room.

Cr Sampson rose on a point of order.

Cr Watt also wanted the motion put.

The mayor said they ought to go into committee.

Cr Rabbich rose to make his explanation.

Cr Sampson asked the motion be put.

Cr O’Leary suggested the mover and seconder would withdraw the motion.

Cr Sampson said he would if Cr Rabbich would confine himself to a personal explanation, although he was not afraid of the press or anyone else.

Cr Rabbich then said: ‘As a representative of the ratepayers intrusted [sic] with the rest of Council in spending public money I left the Council on evening of Feb. 20 with the idea that the business transacted re accepting tenders for road metal was not consistent with honorable and independent action consequently I would not have anything further to do with such.’

The Mayor said such remarks were an insult to the whole of Council and he would not sit and have such things said.

Cr Sampson agreed and moved the Council go into committee to consider the matter.  Cr Watt 2nd.

Cr O’Leary thought such an explanation scandalous and he would support the motion.

The Mayor said they ought to do so having been vilified by the local press on several occasions.

Cr Rabbich moved as an amendment: ‘That the explanation be heard in open Council so then the ratepayers should know the whole business.’  Cr Butterworth 2nd.

The amendment was lost and the motion was carried.

Here our representative and Cr Rabbich left the room.

The Council then discussed the explanation of Cr Rabbich and we learned afterwards:

Cr Sampson moved that Cr Rabbich be requested to withdraw the statement he made unconditionally and to apologise satisfactorily to the Council and in the event of his refusal to be fined £10 in accordance with standing order No. 40 and that he be allowed one week to give the explanation and that he not be allowed to sit until the explanation be given.

Cr Parks 2nd and carried with only Cr Butterworth opposed.
