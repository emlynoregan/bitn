The First BCS Speech Day was well attended by parents.  Principal Mr McCabe felt that the major challenge for the school was for a changed assessment by the students of their own ability.  At present it is too modest and they are capable of a standard equal to any in the state.

Mr Brian Baker is transferring to The Parks

Miss Demidowicz is returning to Adelaide

Miss Haska will travel overseas

Miss Hogan has a yearâ€™s study leave

Miss Harrison is transferring to Clare

Miss Lydeamore is moving to Morphett Vale East

Miss Reed, Mrs Hill and Mr Dower are leaving the ancillary staff.

Incoming staff:

Mr A. Kraft (Deputy Secondary)

Miss C. Bourke (Home Economics)

Mrs Bednall (Physical Education)

Mr Geoff Hood (Geography Senior)

Mr Steven Moloney (Regional Reading Consultant)

Miss Elizabeth Lynch (English/History)

Miss P. Stecker (Art)
