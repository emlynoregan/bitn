Henry Shipway of Paxton Square who was 91 on 4 February is remarkable for one of his years.  He was born at Leighterton in Gloucestershire in 1840 and came to SA in 1856.  With his parents he lived in the Hawker district for many years, but eventually went to Mt Barker in a period of depression and was glad to get work at Magill for 3/- a day to keep a wife and five children and later 6/- a day for 10 hours of work.  He went north again to live and eventually came to Kooringa in 1915.  The celebrations in 1918 made him recall those at the end of the Crimean War.  The ship he was on coming to Australia was at Plymouth when that happened and all the boats in the harbour were decorated and there was general rejoicing.  His wife died in 1916. Of 11 children six sons and three daughters survive.  He has twin brothers aged 86.  One lives in Charra on the West Coast and the other at Prospect.
