Peter Waters, proprietor of Peter’s Meat Service, recently brought the business back to local ownership.  For about the last twelve months Marc’s Meats was owned by Marc Ver Kleef [sic] of Balaklava.

Peter began working for Marc’s Meats in August, but has since bought the business outright.  He now lives in Burra with wife Dianne and children, Samm, Isaac and Bonnie.  [Photo.]
