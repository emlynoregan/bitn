The Wilkins’ House Rebuild

Following the launch of the project to rebuild Sir Hubert Wilkins’ childhood home by Mr Dick Smith on 25 October 1997, a business plan was devised and extensive fundraising has been undertaken by a committee and the Australian Geographic Society.  The project will progress in four stages: a conservation plan, architectural sketch design, quantity surveying and conservation and construction work.  It is expected the work will take two years.

Mt Bryan Primary School has agreed that the school would opt in for the first round of Partnerships 21.
