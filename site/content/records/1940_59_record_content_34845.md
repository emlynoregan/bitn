Paxton Square

‘The Man Who Sees’ writes re the letter from ‘Denizen of the So-Called Demi-Slum’

The writer considers that the letter writer expressed a real fear quite eloquently and even suggested a possible solution in the investment by someone with money in better housing for the poor.

The letter should not, in the writer’s opinion, have been prefaced by a defence of the Council by the editor – let the Council stick up for itself.  It is absurd to say the writer’s outlook was entirely wrong.   The conditions have been known for many years and nothing ‘short of atomic power would change the situation.’

If only more of the Denizens would come out into the open and express themselves, maybe the Central Board of health would move in the matter.

But where are the young men and women who know of these conditions and who could help to assist the defenceless people of the township to secure their rights and privileges?

[The editor then says the topic was the subject of an editorial some time ago and as such he retains the right to comment on letters for or against it.  He also says he ‘did not stoop to hiding behind the cloak of a nom-de-plume.]

‘Evacuee’ writes on the same subject.  Denizen objects to the Burra Council’s efforts to get decent living conditions for the inhabitants of Paxton Square and says the women and children of the Square are not to blame for the archaic form of drainage there – but she seems quite prepared to put up with it and seems to object to the Council’s attempt to put their finger in the pie to give her better drainage and more comfortable living conditions.  The Council wants to get the owners to provide the inhabitants with more comfortable homes.

‘Any Squarite objecting to that move is just plain stupid, or is it that the particular denizen who wrote the letter has an axe to grind and would rather much around in a pig trough than to do a bit of extra work in keeping a home clean.’
