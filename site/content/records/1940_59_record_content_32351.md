In 1928 unimproved value of Burra was £97,857 and annual rental value £17,394.

The highest rate on unimproved values is 1/- in the £ and on rental is 4/- in the £.

On 1928 values a 6d rate on unimproved values would give £2,446-86

A 2/6 rate on annual rental values would yield £2,174-5-0.

In 1932 the assessment of Hann dropped to £14,000 and remained there despite a big rise in property values.  Many houses are assessed too lightly.

Council based its rental values on 5% of property values, so a house valued at £1,500 but assessed at £900 (as some are) returns rates on a rental value of £45 instead of £75.

To be fair the town needed a new assessment if rates were to be based on annual rental values.  This would cost c. £140 (equivalent to a 2d rate).

If it is changed to the unimproved land value system they could use the Land Tax Department folios for 8d each – a total cost to Council of c. £60.  Appeals and their attendant costs would be the responsibility of the Land Tax Department.

Advice is to be sought on this from the relevant Government Departments.
