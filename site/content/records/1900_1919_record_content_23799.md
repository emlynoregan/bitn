Burra Hospital.  On Thursday last over 100 invited guests attended when the Chief Secretary, Hon. A.A. Kirkpatrick MLC, opened the new operating theatre in ‘The W.H. Duncan Wing’.  Through the death of Mr W.H. Duncan the hospital received a legacy of £250, which was the key to getting the new operating theatre built.  Mr Thomas Parks left £75 that also assisted the furnishing.  The Government funded the balance.  The details extend for c. 1¼ columns.
