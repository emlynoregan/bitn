Consecration of St Edmund’s Booborowie

There is a 1-column report on the ceremony which was conducted by Rt Rev. Dr Nutter Thomas, Bishop of Adelaide on 8 November.  Other occasions are recalled:

The laying of the foundation stone.

The dedication of the nave 20 July 1924.

The dedication of the sanctuary 24 June 1928.

The church is of local freestone and the nave is 36’ x 23’6”.  The contractors were Messrs Whitehead of Auburn and Robert Fuss of Aberdeen.  The furnishings are in Tasmanian blackwood.  The altar is beautifully hand carved.  The chancel was dedicated in 1928 and contractors for that were Messrs J. Frahm and R. Fuss, carpenter.

In 1914 a decision was made to build the church at a meeting presided over by Rev. S.J. Bloyd.  Services were then being held in B.H. Beaven’s home and were until 1921 – 16 years in all.

In 1921 the Memorial Hall was used for services.

The cost of the church was £1,610 and substantial assistance came from Mr A.S. Browne, Mr & Mrs I.J. Warnes and Messrs Hawker Bros.  Mrs F.R. Wigley gave a memorial window of St Barnabas in memory of her father the late William P. Barker of Baldina.  Mr F.C. Catt was organist for the past 16 years and gave a beautiful chancel chair of Tasmanian blackwood.
