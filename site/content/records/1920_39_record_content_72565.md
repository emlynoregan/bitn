Burra Town Council

Cr Dow tendered his resignation, giving pressure of private business as a reason.  The Mayor regretted that Cr Dow found the move necessary, as he had contributed much and had been instrumental in getting all the main roads in West Ward sealed, which had proved a good move.

A minute of appreciation was entered and the resignation accepted with regret.  Other Councillors echoed the Mayorâ€™s sentiments.  Cr Dow thanked the others and said that after 5 or 6 years he found he could not continue without letting some of his private business slide and 5-6 years was long enough for anyone.  [Served December 1932 to October 1938.]
