Burra Town Council, 21 June

The Mayor considered that the minute excluding the press was out of order.

Cr Dow insisted it was not and that he would leave the meeting if the press was permitted to stay.  He moved the Council go into committee, but was not seconded and Cr Dow then left the chamber.

The Clerk said the remaining Councillors did not constitute a quorum and eventually Cr Dow returned and the Council went into committee and the press representative left the meeting.
