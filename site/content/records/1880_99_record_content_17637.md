The Chrysanthemum Show, managed by the Institute committee was held on 29 April.  The display was highly creditable and in fact 24 blooms brought from Adelaide by one of the judges as samples of good blooms of the newest and best sorts were quite outdone by many of the locally grown flowers.  The best flowers undoubtedly came from Mr J.D. Cave.

His flowers were sometimes twice the size of others and some extraordinarily large.  Mr C. Drew and Mr J. Lewis also did well, as did Mr Lasscock.  For flowers in pots Dr Brummitt and Messrs Drew, Holder and Mayger divided the honours.  Other successful exhibitors of cut flowers were Mrs McLagan, and Messrs T. Pearce and W. Davey.  The prize list is printed.
