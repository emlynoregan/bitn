Agriculture.   Burra 26 December.  The harvest is proving to be one of the best seen in this neighbourhood.

Few farmers are reaping less than 16 bushels per acre and examples of 30-35 and not rare.  All now depends on fair weather for the next fortnight to enable the riches of the land to be secured.
