Redruth Court, 17 October.

Martha Gentle [a daughter of Lucy Gully] was charged with assaulting a pensioner, Mr Henry R. Bartsch.  Gentle did washing for him and he accused her children of breaking his door and stealing his sugar.  This led up to the alleged incident, which had resulted in his spending 3½ days in hospital.  The evidence was conflicting with Gentle’s defence supported by Lucy Gully and Hetty Williams [presumably the Mrs Williams elsewhere described as the informant’s sister.]  The case was dismissed.
