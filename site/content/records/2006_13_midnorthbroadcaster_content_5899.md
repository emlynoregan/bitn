Paxton Square.  Goyder Council has appointed Burra resident Juanita Queissner as manager of the Paxton Square Cottage from 1 September 2008 to 30 June 2009.  This follows a recommendation from the Paxton Square Cottages Community Committee to move to move to short term rental to maximise income once existing arrangements expire on 31 August 2008.

At a Council meeting on 5 August it was decided a Paxton Square Cottages Operations Committee would be formed comprising two Councillors (Peter Reilly & Robert Bradley) and five members of the community.
