Editorial on Women’s Franchise

The proposal was, from Dr Stirling, that women who had the same qualifications that men needed to vote in the Legislative Council, could vote for both houses.  The editor thought that this was to introduce a silly inequality, but also that this was not the time (in a depression) to raise the question of female suffrage.  Theoretically, he says, nothing could be raised against female suffrage, though he does raise a number of what he sees as practical problems.
