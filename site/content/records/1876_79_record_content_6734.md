Water tabling has been completed as ordered except for some in Market Square - which has been delayed by building operations. Also continuing around the Bank of Australasia in Aberdeen, at Ayers St and near Broad's [i.e. the Aberdeen Hotel] and the water trough. The footbridge opposite the Hospital is almost finished.
