Kooringa News, 9 October

The late lambing season has been very productive with rates as high as 95%.  The yield of wool this year has also been very good and cleaner than in former years.  Many farmers are already sending off their clip, with many loads going through the town this week.

The new National Bank building is proceeding rapidly.  It promises to be one of the finest buildings in Kooringa.  The additions and alterations to the Telegraph Station following its amalgamation with the Post Office are almost completed and will soon be ready for occupation.
