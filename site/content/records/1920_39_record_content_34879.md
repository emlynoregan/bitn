Burra benevolent Society has been unable to supply firewood to all on the list and women will be supplied with 5 cwt each.  Means of raising money were discussed.  An American Tea is to be held at the home of the Mayoress 6 August.  A small clock was presented to Miss Bubb on her departure recently.
