SA Elections: The Kooringa Poll

Up the present the despatches sent to us by express messenger have not arrived.  The chosen messenger got drunk and reached only as far as Gawler, being picked up there on Saturday morning in a state of intoxication.  He came on by mail, but up to this moment we have not been able to find Patrick Spencer.

Polling passed quietly and resulted in:

Kingston	Mildred

Kooringa	225	93

Adelaide	15	1

Total	240	94

This gives Mr Kingston a majority of 146.

The successful candidate was drawn through the streets of the township in his carriage and the humours of the procession were varied by the effigy of a certain Doctor, who has made himself notorious for his zeal on behalf of the opposition.

The Election at Kooringa

Mr Kingston’s Speech at the election is printed.

I have always been the staunch advocate of civil and religious freedom.  I have sought the abolition of all restrictions on my Catholic countrymen and of tithes, the repeal of the Test and Corporation laws, the reform of the House of Commons and the abolition of imprisonment for debt except for fraud.  I will fight any law that seeks to give any man greater civil rights or social rank than another.  While not denying the importance of the agricultural and squatting interests, I assert that the mining interest is the leading one in this colony.  As the miners prosper so will the market for the produce of the farmers and squatters will grow.  I would support a change to the system of opening up mining lands.  Some have proposed leases rather than selling mineral lands, but this does not go far enough.  I propose that any discover of mineral land should be entitled to claim an 80-acre section and on the payment of £1 per acre the land should be his without compensation, but that the grant not be made for one, two or three years, but as soon as he can prove the expenditure of £500 in exploring and developing the land for mineral purposes, the grant should be issued without further conditions.

[He then discusses his role in the passing of the Bill to establish SA and his passage to SA in charge of the first party of emigrants in 1836, arriving at Holdfast Bay in November 1836.]

I will not say no one has done more for SA, but I will say no one has served it more sincerely and devotedly.

‘It is now within a few days of six years since I first stood on this spot, entrusted by the Directors with the responsible duty of fixing the boundaries of the Special Survey.’

No director has devoted more time and attention, or worked more zealously to promote the prosperity of the men than the humble individual now soliciting your suffrages.

[He then goes on at some length to attack Mr Lang, who had come out as his opponent until discovering that he could not be simultaneously a legislator and a magistrate.  He also attacks Lang as a magistrate, calling attention to his inconsistencies in sentencing; ‘today, a burglar’s violence in the dead of night is punished by a fine of a few shillings; to-morrow, a misdemeanour is visited with imprisonment and hard labour.’]

Then came Mr Mildred, who has tried his fortune in almost every constituency; Port, East Torrens, Gawler & Stanley, Barossa and Port Lincoln.  Rejected in his own neighbourhood, he came to seek the votes of electors in Kooringa.  His own district of East Torrens has this last week been in need of a candidate, but no one there has proposed Mr H. Mildred.

[Kingston then goes on at length to describe how Mr Mildred infiltrated by means of an alias, the group of gentlemen who formed an association meeting at the Adelphi in London in 1834, to promote the establishment of SA.  He says Mildred did nothing to help the cause, but positioned himself to benefit when the obstacles to establishing the colony had been overcome.  He says he was a speculator.]

The requisition calling on me to stand bears the signatures of the Directors Messrs Paxton, Sanders, & Beck and of Mr Ayers.  These men would hardly do this, or elect me to a seat on their own Councils if I was the weak and talentless individual the opposition would have you believe.
