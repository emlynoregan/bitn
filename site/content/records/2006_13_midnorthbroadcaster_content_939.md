Stockman Electronics of Burra has recently become a GME Accredited Telemetry Dealer.  Telemetry is the use of remote control technologies for security, irrigation and electric fences, but most commonly for stock water management.  While most are UHF based systems, there are satellite and mobile phone based options.  As well as being convenient, the system saves enormously on labour and fuel costs for the producer.  [Photo.]
