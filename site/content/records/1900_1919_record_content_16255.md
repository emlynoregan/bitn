Obituary.  J. Dowd [John Joseph] was killed at Whyte Yarcowie on 21 December 1905.  He was helping to pull down an old two storey hotel, his former home.  The workers had been camping in a small room in the building and a partition wall above it was to be pulled down.  Mr Dowd said he wanted a drink before continuing and entered the small room.  As he did so the wall fell into the small room and continued on taking out the floor and ending up in the cellar.  Mr Dowd was completely buried in the debris and the body could not be extracted for some time.  He was 48 and is survived by a widow and ten children.
