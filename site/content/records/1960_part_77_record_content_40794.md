Obituary.  Mrs Lucy Treloar of Spalding died at Jamestown Hospital recently aged 83, having come from Edithburgh, Scotland, about three years ago.  [Born Lucy Dinah Jones 12 October 1885 Delamere, SA: died 5 June 1968 Jamestown, residence Spalding.  The reference to Scotland seems likely to be an error given that her husband, Nicholas Victor Treloar died 23 December 1960 at Yorketown, residence Edithburgh SA; and I can find no Edithburgh in Scotland.]
