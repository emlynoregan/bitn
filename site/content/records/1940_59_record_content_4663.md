The Buffalo Lodge put on a social for the town’s young people in the Institute on Wednesday.  In some degree it was a form of compensation for the lack of holidays away from the town for many of them this year due to wartime conditions.  Items and games were enjoyed, as was a lavish dispensation of ice cream and a buffet supper.  Bags of sweets and peanuts were given to the children and dancing followed supper.
