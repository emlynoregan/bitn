This issue saw a change in the size and organisation of the paper.    It increased in size to become seven instead of five columns wide.  It changed from eight pages to four and many items were printed using an annoyingly smaller typeface.  The reason given was that with an increased circulation they needed to print the paper more quickly and the new format cut the number of times the paper had to run through the printing machine.

Page 1

Large advertisements some local and others not.

Page 2

A few smaller advertisements, sales and public notices, but not as many as in earlier years.  News begins early on the page, but is heavily mixed with news-like advertisements for things like toilet soap, or haemorrhoid cream.  A column by ‘Eyespy’ of passing events concentrated largely on events from beyond the local area.

Page 3

Similar to page 2 with very wordy advertisements for items like Dr Williams Pink Pills, Clements Tonic and Zam-buk Balm, which surely no one ever read!

In general the paper was of fairly poor quality.  Events that were foreshadowed were not always subsequently reported.  The Council received perfunctory treatment: perhaps because it went so smoothly.  ‘They Say’ & ‘Short & Sharp’ columns contained references to matters that could have been developed and which locals probably knew about, but are now obscure.  There are many items that are essentially fillers.  The actual printing is also poor with many pages faint and hard to read and the type size is very small and must have been hard to read by the artificial lights in use at the time.
