7 October 1875, page 7

Frederick C. Austin writes from York Hotel, Adelaide 6 October.

Last Saturday a man broke his thigh at Ketchowla.  He was sent to Burra for treatment at 12.30 p.m. and endured a very painful ten hour journey.  Weary and in pain and suffering intense pain he presented a letter of recommendation to Dr Nesbitt, requesting the latter to put him where he thought it would be most quiet.  Dr Nesbitt recommended J.G. Lamb’s Burra Hotel.  There he was refused accommodation on the grounds there were already tow sick men in the house.  There was no claim the house was full.  When I spoke to Mr Lamb on the matter, he could only say he had not personally refused accommodation.  The man was taken in by Mr Richardson of the Miners’ Arms, although his house was quite full.  I do not need to remark upon the case.

‘I would merely ask if there is no law to prevent such wanton cruelty? And are bushmen, because they happen to be wounded and incapable, to be refused admittance to hotels, which are licensed for the general accommodation of the public as well as for the profit of the landlords?’
