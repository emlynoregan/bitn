Burra Town Council 2 June

The cost of shifting 15 streetlights was £131-2-0 as stated in a letter from the Co.  Council deferred a decision until next meeting.

The Post Master General is considering a request that the mail times at Kooringa close later.

Mr R. Phillips of the Exchange Hotel seeks permission to build a balcony on the hotel.  Further information was sought as it might involve moving a light pole.

Plans were received from J. Allen re the proposed building next to Dr Steele’s.  Approval was denied until a better quality building is proposed.
