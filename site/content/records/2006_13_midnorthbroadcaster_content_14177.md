Commercial Street Pedestrian Refuge

Goyder CEO, John Brak, answered some questions on the proposal.  The design was a standard one used in city and country locations in SA.  Its location maximises crossing for the supermarket and the Post Office and provides a fixed point for crossing rather than the randomness operating at present.  It aims to achieve a safer crossing for the young, the old and the frail, especially safety from reversing vehicles.  New kerb ramps are another advantage.  At present it will only be installed if costs are met by the State Government under its safety program.  There will be a loss of two parking spaces and the provision of a disabled parking space.  A light controlled crossing would be more expensive, would be more disruptive to traffic, would occupy parking spaces and would not be likely to be funded by the Sate.  Plans are on view in the Council office.
