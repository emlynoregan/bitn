Burra Uniting Church is selling the pews from Redruth Church.  They were made from solid Huon pine and ranged in length from five to ten feet.  They were offered first to people with a personal connection to the church.

[Personal interest.  Many of the pews were inscribed with graffiti, some of them dating back more than a century.  For example:

L.R. Fuss (aged 12) won a prize at the 1898 Burra Show for ornamental text, but this example of his skill was not likely to have received such approbation.]
