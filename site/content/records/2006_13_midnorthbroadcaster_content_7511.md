Burra Ambulance Service is stretched and in need of more volunteers.  A recent recruitment drive had a disappointing result.  At the moment numbers are adequate, but that can change quickly and at least four more are needed to reach the desirable number of around 20.

The Hallett 4 Wind Farm of 132MW will go ahead following an announcement by AGL.  It is to be located at North Brown Hill near Jamestown and will cost about $340 million over the next two years.  There will be about 120 jobs during construction and about 10 permanent jobs for operation.  There will be 63 turbines.  It will lie immediately north of Hallett 1 commissioned in June 2008.
