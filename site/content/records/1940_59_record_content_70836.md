Burra Electric Supply Co. had a minor fault in the powerhouse machinery during the four day heat wave and there was a power failure on Saturday.  It was rectified, but recurred in the evening, causing voting in the Federal Election to be completed by the light of candles and a kerosene lamp and a battery spotlight from the Burra Motor Co.  The pictures at the Town Hall were delayed for some time.
