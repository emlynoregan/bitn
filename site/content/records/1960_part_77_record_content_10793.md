Burra High School.  The Jubilee History continued by R.V. Mueller.

1921

Twenty-five students started the year.  On 6 April the school closed for the laying of the foundation stone of the Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial by Governor Sir Archibald Weigall.  On 29 May heavy rain flooded the streets and Lady Hackett visited to speak to the girls about Girl Guides.  Inspector W. Adey cited average attendances and said Burra would be considered when the new Higher Primary Schools were being established.  Burra average attendance:

1913	25.3	1914	23	1915	24.2

1916	27.3	1917	23.8	1918	33.8

1919	13.1	120	23.1	1921	20

1922

John Biddle was Assistant in Charge with Edna Grosvenor newly appointed and enrolment was 44.  An Old Scholars Assoc. was inaugurated.  On 21 September all classes went to the top of the hill to observe the solar eclipse.

1923

Lancelot Carthew was Assistant in Charge with Miss O.G. Mawley & R. Davis.  Enrolment was 36.  On 24 March Miss Mawley transferred to Adelaide when attendance fell to 29.  On very hot days the boys were taken to the Mine Pool during the last lesson and the girls were dismissed.  Heavy rain made the road to Clare impassable for sports on 19 July and it wasn’t much better on 22 September when teams arrived at Clare at 10.30 and had to leave early on their return.

1924

Enrolment was 35.  Domestic Arts was introduced with Miss Forss (part-time).

(To be continued.)
