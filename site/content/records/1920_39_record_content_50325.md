Burra Town Council, 9 April

Mr Bednall writes ‘That it is the desire of your Council (without any request on the part of my Club) that the clause of the agreement relating to tennis on Good Friday and Sunday be broken.  I assume that your action has been duly noted and appreciated by the committee and members of or club.’

Mr Kellaway found the letter to be satirical and inferred that because the Council had broken a part of the agreement the club was entitled to do as it liked.  It was adding insult to injury.

P.L. Rosman Hon. Secretary of the Bowling Club said that Mr W.H. Sandland owned the old Bible Christian Church site and was prepared to exchange it for the Council Depot next to the bowling green in the interests of the Bowling Club.  It would be an improvement for the town, as they would put two lawn tennis courts on the Depot site.

The Unemployment Relief Council forwarded c. £4 being 50% subsidy on relief work carried out by Council.  £84 was available, but to get it the Council would have to spend the same amount of its own money.

Council of Churches asked the Council to help in getting signatures against the establishment of betting shops.  Council resolved to take no active part.

The Kooringa Tennis Club’s request to buy and the Bowling Club’s request to swap land will be considered at a special meeting of Council on 1st Monday in May.

The Mayor reported on the improvements made to the rotunda.

Cr Dow said the street between Dr Steven’s and Mr Gordon’s was an eyesore.  He wondered whether the Council would sell it.  Mrs Steven was permitted to plant some trees there.

Local Board of Health

Dr Steven reported the school water to be quite good.  The head teacher denied having prevented children from bringing their own water in bottles.
