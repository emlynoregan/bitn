Annual Wool Trip to Sturt Vale

Thirty-three men in seven cars made the trip to Sturt Vale, property of I.J. Warnes & Sons on 12 April.  The idea is to gain ideas for the more profitable management of flocks.  The guests have the run of the shearing shed and access to the wool expert Mr Codrington and to Mr Warnes and his sons Rex and Jim who answer why things are done as they are.  The cars left at 7.30 a.m. in dense fog, but this was left behind at Baldina creek.  From King’s Well, one turns off the Broken Hill Road into I.J. Warnes & Sons’ property for the 60-mile run through the firm’s Koomooloo & Lagoon Stations to Sturt Vale.  This year the country got better as they went on due to the heavy rains in the early part of the year.  Annual grasses were prolific and young bushes were well established.  A new and much straighter road has been made since last year.  At each fence there is a ramp and grid in place of a gate and a white post to indicate that if at 60 m.p.h. you lift your foot at the post you will slow down enough to negotiate the ramp without braking.  The road is however, dusty.  The 81 mile run took on average about two and a half hours.  At the shearing shed the silence is surprising to those used to machine shearing.  Here hand shears are strangely silent.  Morning tea with hot buttered scones and cakes was followed by a return to the shed.  About 40 hands were employed – classers, pickers, pressers, runners and twenty shearers.  There were few calls for ‘tar’.  Shearers handled 80-100 per day and ranged in age from Josiah Rosewall [1868-1955] who has done the work for 51 years to young men in their 20s.  We understand Norman Bell was ringer this year.  [Norman Lyle Bell? born 1911.]

Most visitors also inspected a couple of big 12-disc Shearer ploughs which were to be used to plant lucerne in another part of the run.  Mr Warnes found these ploughs would go through sticks, tobacco bush and bush.

Dinner at the shearers’ quarters was welcome with hot meat and vegetables.  35 people were catered for in five minutes by Joe Parks, said to be one of the best shearers’ cooks in the state.

The tip aims to benefit the smaller sheep-owners and show them how to get up their clips and it is a link between the Burra Show Society and its subscribers.

‘Burra District was considered to be one of the most profitable wool-growing districts in the State and was noted for its sound and bulky wool.’

This trip had been offered for the last 5 years and attendances were not getting smaller.  A.B. Riggs moved a vote of thanks for the invitation on behalf of all those present.  Mr Codrington endorsed the usefulness of the trip for the small sheep owner.  This was his 18th visit to Sturt Vale and he said few stations were managed as efficiently.  Classing was done on highly technical lines and small growers could not hope to do the same, but could class their wool in a small way.  Wool buyers were after particular types of wool for the manufacturers.  They must consider the number of sheep to be shorn, the lines to be classed and how many lines to make out of a clip.  Fibres demarcation for Merinos being 58s to 70s, but the small man could make only two lines, mainly 64s and putting out the extra heavy and extra strong fleeces with a few shabby ones.

In the mallee lands the wool was low grade and it was not possible to top-make as much as it was in this district.  It was not necessary to overdo the skirting unless burrs were numerous.  Sometimes it was profitable to go right through the fleece and remove burrs.  If growers wanted to obtain high values a certain amount of classing had to take place.

A flock of 500 would take 3 lines, A.A. & A.

One of 1,000 would take 4 lines, 2 each of A.A. & A. in strong and medium.

If inferior types were carried the smaller grower could not afford to cull.  Anything not conforming to type should be culled.

Rex Warnes said that perhaps next year they would visit Koomooloo.  Mr Warnes thanked the cook, Joe Parks of Burra.

29 years ago he had bought Sturt Vale (of 250 squ. miles) for £7,500.  Everyone said he would fail and never muster sheep there, but the muster had never missed.  Today there were 40 men on the staff.  He had got some land from the Government to add to Sturt Vale.  Mutooroo Pastoral Co. had turned the water off its natural course and left Sturt Vale practically dry.  They had now got water rights back, but had spent £5-6,000 on a weir to divert the water back, but unsuccessfully.  Now they were going to grow lucerne with the water so Sturt Vale could withstand drought.  In several paddocks they were trying to get natural fodder back by keeping stock out.

A visit to Saltbush Dam showed visitors 80 acres of lucerne up to 4’6” high, planted in the bed of a watercourse.  On average Jim Warnes said two floods 50” to 10’ deep and eight miles wide came down every year so there should be plenty of lucerne.

Nearby was a large acreage of what looked like wild verbena 30” high.  Sheep don’t like it much, but bullocks thrive on it.  Back at the homestead there was time for tea and cakes before starting for home.  In a 12 hour trip of about 190 miles there were no mishaps and not even one puncture.
