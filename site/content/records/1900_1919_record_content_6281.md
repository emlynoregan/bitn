Golden Wedding.

Mr & Mrs Richard Snell celebrated their golden wedding in their Quarry St home yesterday.  Mr Snell arrived in SA by the Santipore in October 1848 and his wife, then Miss Bishop, in the Mary Ann in April 1849.  They were married in Burra by Rev. James Pollitt in the old St Maryâ€™s on 26 August 1852.  Soon after they went to Victoria and lived in Castlemaine for many years, returning to Burra in 1877.  Both remain in good health.  There are four daughters and two sons living with 17 grandchildren, mostly in SA.
