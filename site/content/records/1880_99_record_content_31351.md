In 1888 public works expenditure was £187-15-9

Income in 1886 from rates was £711-10-5 and the Govt. subsidy was £331-13-3,

in a total of £1,272-8-9

In 1887 these figures were £718-15-8, £146-16-2 and £1,198-15-1 respectively.

In 1888 they were £563-18-7, nil and £716-15-7 respectively.

The assessment has dropped by one-third and total income has almost halved.

[To c. 56%]

The large public works expenditure of 1886 increased the overdraft by over £350.  The Council was then bound to be extremely economical, but this makes the job of Councillor barren with little chance of a Councillor leaving any memorial work behind him.
