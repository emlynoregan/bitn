Court, 20 September

Mrs Klaffus proceeded against her husband Charles Gustav Klaffus for a protection order under the Married Women’s Act.  She said her husband had paid her just 10/- in five years.  She was willing to go on supporting herself, but wanted the protection of the court and secure custody of her son.  Mr Klaffus appeared in a merry condition: ‘But the well-known fencer was beyond making a speech.’

Mr Hinde gave an order for the custody of the son and one preventing the defendant cohabiting with his wife.  ‘Oh, I say noddings ’gainst dat.’ said Charles Klaffus.

Walter Patterson, who rode a railway truck south on a goods train recently appeared at the Burra Show where he indulged in too much alcohol and ended up in the cells overnight.  He was subsequently was fined 5/- or 3 days for drunkenness and £1 or 7 days for insulting behaviour.  [See also XV, 635, 20 July 1904, page 2.]
