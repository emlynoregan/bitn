Burra Mine

The western side of the open cut has now been mined to its lowest level.  Locals wishing to view and photograph this completed part of the mining operation can do so between 9 a.m. and 10.30 a.m. on Saturday.  The Morphett Shaft Main Gate (above the chimney) will be open.

Early in 1981 the old mine tailing dam will have to be prepared for present day tailings disposal.  All the old tailings will be covered and will no longer be available for local use.  As from 11 December 1980 to 19 January 1981 tailings will be available to local residents free of charge.  On 19 January the tailings dam will be closed.

[Conditions are then specified.]
