Burra & District Band.  An appeal is made for the return of any instruments that belonged to the old Burra & District Band to the Secretary of the new Burra & District Band, Mr T.C.A. Radford.  The band is also anxious to borrow or buy any available instruments.  A learnersâ€™ class will be established under Mr George Terry.  The band is anxious to secure employment in the town for Mr B. Malycha, formerly Bandmaster of the Renmark Band and then of the 2/27 Battalion Band AIF, so that he may become bandmaster here.
