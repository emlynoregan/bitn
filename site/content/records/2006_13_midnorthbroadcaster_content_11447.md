Burra Creek Boaties

With the creek flowing strongly after the heavy storms of last Tuesday and Wednesday, a group of boating enthusiasts decided to attempt to navigate the stream from the Leighton Road turn-off near the ‘Midnight Oil’ house. [Cobb & Co.’s Corner.] to the southern outskirts of the town. A small dinghy was captained by Heath Tippett and crewed by James Reilly, Ben Tiver, Johnny Lynch and Ricardo Rivas successfully negotiated the route past the golf course and under the old railway bridge.  There was a capsize at the Taylor Street ford, but the voyage was resumed and carried out successfully to the southern outskirts of Burra.
