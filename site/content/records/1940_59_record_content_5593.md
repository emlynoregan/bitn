Burra Institute

The trustees met on 18 April.  The State Bank had written on 9 April asking what the trustees intended to do about the mortgage due to be repaid on 1 April – balance of principal plus interest.  They replied that as the Institute was unable to meet its commitments and as neither the Burra Corporation nor the subscribers have made any effort to secure a committee to run the Institute since the AGM in January failed to secure any nominations, the trustees advise the State Bank to adopt one of the following options:

An amount of £661-15-9 be written off the capital as bad debt and the interest on the balance remain as at present.

The present rate of interest on the full loan be reduced to 4%.

The Bank exercise its rights under the mortgage.

If either option 1 or 2 above is adopted the trustees will endeavour to arrange a subscribers’ meeting and to form a committee as in the past.  The trustees will cease to function as a management committee on 30 June 1941.
