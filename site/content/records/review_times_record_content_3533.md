She’ll Be Riot was quite superb at the Redruth Gaol.  It effectively showed people what life in the Redruth Reformatory was like.  The audience was led around the cells to see cameo scenes in each cell.  One audience member, Mr Colin Fidock, said the performance portrayed the life of the girls in the reformatory as well as the depravation [sic] of the copper miners.  [Should this read ‘deprivation’?]

‘The performance really got over the message of how difficult it would have been,’ said Mr Fidock.

Mrs Nicholls said the audience ‘clapped the goodies and booed the baddies’ as they followed the action around the gaol.

Both Mrs Nicholls and Mr Fidock mentioned the cell containing a girl with a skeleton bridegroom that gave an insight into the desperation of the girls who would marry men much older than themselves just to escape.

The second half of the performance focused on the riot itself.
