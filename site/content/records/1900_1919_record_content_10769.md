Weather.  The seasonâ€™s most severe frost was last Thursday.

Tomorrow is the third anniversary of the great snow fall in which drifts up to 6ft high were recorded.

Rain out east has been useful with almost an inch at Mongolata where the dams are full.  Baldina Creek flowed, but Stone Chimney Creek did not.
