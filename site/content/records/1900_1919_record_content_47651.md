Mr Crewes took up the case of the man admitted to hospital on his note and then turned out.  He said the man was brought to him by Josiah Thomas and was spitting blood and looked seriously ill.  He said Dr Ashton would not admit him to hospital because it was in a state of insolvency.  After his discharge Mr Thomas took the man in and on Saturday night as much as a pint of blood and phlegm came away from his lungs.
