The proposed 275 Kv Power Line from Pt Augusta to Tungkillo has raised the following concerns:

It would traverse prime agricultural land in the district

It would cross the southern entrance to the town.

It would be carried on huge 150 foot high pylons carrying eight cables each.

It could lead to the spread of rye grass toxicity.

It could affect tourism.

It would jeopardise the beauty of our unique and historic town.
