Burra Town Council, 20 June

The Local Government Department notified a subsidy of £212 on rates.

A.J. & P.A. McBride desired to demolish the house occupied by the late Mrs Annie Howell and to erect a new one on the site, but the allotment was too small – both the street and the ground were out of alignment and they asked the Council to sell them a portion facing the main road and a piece of lane to the side.

The Town Clerk was not sure that even then a house could be erected that would conform to the Building Act.  The site will be inspected.

Various new street lights were approved.  (At Kooringa Methodist Church and near Guy Tiddy’s)  [A reference to a light in Graham is unclear unless that was Guy Tiddy’s.]

There were complaints about unlit street lights.

The Company said there were difficulties in getting globes.  The matter was clearly unacceptable and the Company will be written to.

Dogs in the streets were a nuisance.
