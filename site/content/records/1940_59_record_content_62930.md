Burra Primary School Parents & Friends Assoc. held its AGM 15 March.

A presentation was made to the retiring secretary of the school committee, Mr J. Wohlers and one to the retiring secretary of the Welfare Club, Mrs Wohlers.  Both were wished well at their new home in Pinnaroo.  Mr M.G. Stockman was re-elected Chairman with Darrell Field as Secretary & Treasurer.  The Chairman reported a successful year in which a major achievement was the remodelling of the old [condemned] classroom in time for the start of 1954.  This had been a thorn in the side of various committees for 20 years or more.  This enabled the classes to be withdrawn from St Mary’s Parish Hall.  A film strip projector has been installed and arrangements made with the High School over its use.  A contract has been let for installing a broadcast unit, which should be working in the near future.  The Welfare Club ran a successful dance and an Arbor Day and assisted with the Coronation Day Sports as well as holding a Christmas Tree and Party at the end of the year.  Work has also been done on the school garden.  Thanks to R.C. Lott for running Guy Fawkes Night and to M. Tiver for having the old committee minute book bound so it can be read by future generations.  We have erected a front fence and applied for more asphalt for the yard.
