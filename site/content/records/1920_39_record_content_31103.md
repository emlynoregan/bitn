‘Old Time Dancer’ thinks Mr Hogan should have and could have easily justified old-time dancing without resorting to an appeal to our sensual natures.

L.J. Kesting head teacher at Booborowie wonders why one form of dancing has to be ‘versus’ another anyway.  Old Time dancing has stood the test of time.  The new is like most things new, subject to merciless and unreasoning criticism.  He develops this point with reference to other innovations and then returns to ask if critics have actually seen really good exponents of modern dance – the real steps of the One Step, the Fox Trot, Modern Waltz, Yale Blues etc. are most skilful and should not be judged by ‘the push-pull’ sort of walk so frequently seen on a dance floor.  Crude imitations should not be held up as modern dancing.  Our young people could be doing far worse things than having a happy time ‘even though they are not employing the steps of any known dance’.  Old Timers are to be congratulated on bringing back their dances, but youth should not be condemned.
