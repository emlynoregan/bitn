Port Wakefield Facilities

A large public meeting of influential people was held at the Stanley Arms at Watervale on 25 March.  The meeting was concerned with improving Port Wakefield as a place for exporting SA’s produce.  A petition had been prepared for Parliament.  Mr Horrocks read the petition and then addressed the meeting.

Exports from the port in the last fifteen months have been:

Copper Ore	£220,000

Wool	£106,000

And a large quantity of flour and wheat.

Imports 	£49,000

Since it was established not more than £2,000 has been expended in improvements and now a number of producers are considering sending their produce by road, despite the higher cartage costs; so difficult is the loading of vessels at Port Wakefield.

Barges cannot reach vessels lying outside, except in very high or spring tides and there is grossly inadequate wharfage accommodation.  The creek is inconveniently narrow.  It needs to be widened and the wharf extended to enable more and large barges to be loaded.

The memorialists sought for £20,000 to be included in the estimates for the harbour improvements.

The English & Australian Copper Co. has repeatedly appealed to the Legislature for aid, but without effect.

If Port Wakefield were to be made a port of easy shipment the wealth of Burra and the surrounding district would be exported from it for many years.  The improvement of Port Wakefield would be a more substantial benefit than the expenditure of £500,000 on the extension of the Gawler railway.

Land sales around Port Wakefield have contributed £120,000 to the Treasury and yet little of that has found its way back to improve this part of the country.

Mr Lennon also spoke.  He asked that the bar be deepened, the silt removed and all obstructions done away with to make the harbour one of safety and easy entrance for ships of large tonnage.

He pointed out that their own interest in the port was enduring because they were of the district, while the interests of the Directors of the SA Mining Association and the E & A Copper Company were of a fleeting nature and they would soon shift to an alternative route if it paid them better.  If those in the Port Wakefield area wanted development and growth based on the copper trade they needed to see action on the port now.  A united approach to Parliament was needed.

The petition already carries over 300 signatures.
