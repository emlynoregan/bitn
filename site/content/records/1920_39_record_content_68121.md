Obituary.  George Frederick Riggs, manager for Baldina Mongolata GM Co. died through exposure.  He was found lying dead under the verandah of T.H. Thomason’s residence at Paradise on Thursday morning.  The body was removed to the police station where Norman Ford and Mr Ratcliffe of Aberdeen (a relative) identified the body.  Dr Steele said in his opinion death was caused by exposure.  The deceased had left the town for Mongolata at 5 p.m. Wednesday and must have meant to go to J.R. Barker’s residence, but must have met trouble at the creek, as his truck was found 7-8 miles from Burra near Baldina Station.  Apparently he walked back for assistance and encountered the terrific storm of rain and wind on the way.

[Died 2 September 1937 Kooringa, residence Mongolata aged 50.]
