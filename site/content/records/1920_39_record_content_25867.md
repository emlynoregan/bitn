Burra Town Council

Permission was granted for alterations to the Royal Exchange Hotel.

The Town Clerk in answer to a question said the total cost of the recent traffic control experiments was £21-7-7.

The Town clerk and Police have suggested changing the by-law to eliminate ranking [parallel parking] and allowing only parking at 45°.

Cr Woollacott did not believe parking was safe around the Market Square curve.

Cr Collins thought all cars should be parked.

Cr Riggs thought parking needed a fair trial: it had only been in for a fortnight.  Like Cr Woollacott he did not like parking between McKenzie’s [Drew Lane] and Bence’s [Mt Pleasant Rd].

The discussion went on for some time and is reported at length.

A letter of sympathy sent to Mrs A.J. McBride on the death of Mr A.J. McBride.

Various proposals to tar roads were discussed.  Cr Collins was concerned about tractors breaking the surface.  [This probably refers to activity in Morehead St, since Cr Woollacott said they had no alternative route unless they went over ‘Cowdung Hill’.]

The Town Clerk said it was not illegal if they had the correct tread.

Cr Allen moved that ratepayers be notified that St Just St was to be opened to Creek St. and Messrs Radford and Walker be requested to move their fences to their correct boundaries.

[Creek St does not appear on any maps I have seen.  Perhaps it refers to a surveyed road on the line of the modern footpath and cycle track.]

The Mayor questioned the cost of the telephone.

The Town Clerk said the Council paid £25 p.a. for the Council Chamber and half the cost of the telephone and half the cost of the Post Office Box.

Did the District Council pay anything for the phone?

Cr Harris thought that District Council calls were paid for in cash by the clerk.

Each ward was allocated £300 from the rates.
