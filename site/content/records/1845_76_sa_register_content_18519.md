Kooringa News, 2 June

The heavy gale which affected the entire colony scattered flocks of sheep in this district.  They have been recovered, but with heavy loss of lambs.  Runs that usually have a 90% lambing rate will struggle this year to get to 30%.

Ashton’s Anglo-Saxon Circus has been in town for two nights and was fairly patronised.

The St Leon Troupe has also performed here.

Her Majesty’s birthday was celebrated with a holiday and a successful ball.

Mr Bocaut [sic: Boucaut] gave a lecture on Trial by Jury.  It was thinly attended.
