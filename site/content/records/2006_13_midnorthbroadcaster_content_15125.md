SALA Festival 2012 opened at the Burra Regional Art Gallery at the weekend with its exhibition ‘A Stitch in Time’.  The opening featured a dance routine to the evocative Mean Culpa by ‘Enigma’ choreographed by Putu Suta.  Glenys Christopher was unable to tell of her recent artistic journey to Greece due to ill health, but a postcard of the adventure was read by Pip Edson.  MP Dan van Holst Pellekaan and his wife were special guests.

The Mt Bryan Photo Competition entries were on display at Mt Bryan Hotel on Sunday evening when winners were announced and prized awarded.  More than 20 entrants produced photographs of the area.  Winners:

Open Section ‘A Stitch in Time’, ‘Wind Farm at Sunset’ by Allies Schulz.
