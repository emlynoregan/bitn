Obituary.  Mrs M.A. [Maria Anne] Gare died 20 October at the residence of her daughter Mrs W.J. Hunkin of Parkside.  She was born in Kensington London in March 1841.  Her father, Rev. Charles Hall, came to Australia when she was a girl.  She married the late Edward Gare in 1862 and they lived on several northern sheep stations before coming to the Mt Bryan District in the early 1880s.  She also spent brief periods in Broken Hill and WA and moved to Malvern, Adelaide in 1896, returning to Redruth in 1909.  Mr Gare died in 1911.  In the past 15 years she has been an active worker at Redruth Church.  There are seven surviving sons and three daughters: Messrs E. (Pt Pirie), F.M. (Katanning WA), L.W. (Hyde Park), S.P. (Adelaide) and Mesdames J. Thomas (Redruth), A.E. Thomas (Aberdeen) & W.J. Hunkin (Parkside).

[This adds up to seven surviving children rather than seven sons and three daughters.  Records are incomplete, but available data suggests ‘seven sons and three daughters’ was actually correct:

Charles Alfred 1862-1918	William Hall 1873-1957

Albert Edward 1864-1956	Alice Eveline 1875-1950 m. H.H. Thomas

Frank Marshal 1866- [presumably died in WA]	Samuel Ernest Rudge 1877-1949

Ada Maria 1868-1952(?) m. James Thomas	Florence Ethel 1880-1960 m. W.J. Hunkin

Cornelius Wesley 1870-1952	Lewis Whitfield 1882-1958

George Larter 1872-? 	Philip Stanley 1885-1972]
