World’s End.  The recent storm on the 17th brought with it over 170 points of rain and considerable crop damage.  Wheat yet green will recover, but early varieties were too far advanced to come back.  Many houses and outbuildings suffered damage.  F. Duldig’s horse stable lost about 70ft of its 100ft roof, but the iron essentially slid down the wall and was little damaged.  It was soon replaced.

Wandillah and Cartapo Blocks bought by the Government for closer settlement are in the hands of the surveyor.
