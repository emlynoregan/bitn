Burra Town Council, 6 February

Kooringa Children’s Playground

F. Harris the Hon. Secretary of the committee says the committee had some years ago been offered a lease, but nothing had been finalised and they now thought it better if the Council took over control.  The Mayor thought it for the best.

The Town Clerk said the committee had in hand about £1-17-6 and would use it to get the place clean and tidy for the handover.  The request was agreed to.

T.P. Halls & Alex Bevan were granted town motor licences on the same basis as for 1932.

The Fire Brigade costs for the year are to be £78.

Various road and drainage matters were discussed.

The problem of parking cars on Frank Harris’s shop corner was raised and an inspection of the site decided upon.

Cr Jennison complained of people parking in front of street bowsers.  He asked for a no parking sign to be painted on the road.  This was left to the Inspector’s discretion.

The Mayor said revenue for the last 12 months at a 2/3 rate was £2,203.

He wanted to reduce rates, saying in 1932 maintenance cost £648 and unemployment relief £161, leaving about £1,500 for ‘overhead expenses’.  He considered this too much.  A considerable argument erupted, as part of those expenses was the lighting bill.

The Mayor then wanted to cut the Medical Officer’s salary from £50 to £25 – in fact they had had no report from him for 11 years and the post might be abolished.

This provoked a heated exchange in which the loud blustering of the Mayor eventually provoked sharp responses from Crs Dow, Sampson and Jennison.

Cr Dow felt he had been personally insulted and shouted down.

Cr Sampson found ‘too much personal bias’ and would ‘sooner stop at home than come here to a dogfight’.  He accused the Mayor of not giving anyone ‘a chance to say a dashed word, you go on like a babbling brook, I\'m sick of it’.

Cr Jennison thought they would get on better if the Mayor were ‘not so overbearing and treated us as reasonable men’.

The Mayor apologised.

The Councillors generally supported the need for a Medical Officer.

The Mayor then turned to the employees and suggested they did not need two hands, and Mr Voumard could be made a casual hand.  Another altercation erupted during which the Mayor believed he had been insulted by the Town Clerk.

Finally Cr Dow moved for a ten-minute adjournment to allow tempers to cool.

After returning Cr Riggs then moved an adjournment for a week to allow the Town Clerk to get out all items of expenditure for consideration, but this was lost on the casting vote of the Mayor.

Cr Bevan then moved Mr Voumard be made a casual hand with preference when there was work to be done.  Carried.

Cr Sampson said the Electric Supply Co. was already giving a price reduction and if they acted quietly they might be induced to do more.

Mayor: Ranger and Poundkeeper cost £36 p.a. for a return of £2.
