Barkers of Baldina Cottage Homes

$17,000 more is required to erect three more units.  The cost of the three units is now $70,000.  Government subsidy will bring in $37,000, but only if all the necessary money is in hand before work starts.  Cash in hand is $19,000, leaving a shortfall of $17,000 to be raised.  The proposed units will be the same standard as the existing ones.  The No. 6 Social Club (Masonic) has also handed $657 to the appeal as the result of Friday night’s cabaret.  The hotels of the district have all made generous donations, as have Moyles, Coca Cola Bottlers, Snack foods Pty Ltd and Jackie Kleinig’s Dance Band.  A gift of $300 has come from ‘Mackerode’ Mt Bryan*.  Money must be raised quickly before costs soar even higher.

[* This was corrected in the next issue page 2 to read ‘The Mackerode Gift $300.’]
