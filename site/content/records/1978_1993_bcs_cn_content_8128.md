Burra Community Sports Club

President Graham Kellock reports on the year ending July 1983

The Sports Complex was completed and opened.

The then Minister for Sport and Recreation Mr Wilson performed the opening ceremony on 31 October 1982 when the event incorporated a reunion of former footballers.

Past Players played Present Players and came out as narrow victors.

The first year’s payments were all met.

The grand final was played here in September.

The Sportsman’s Dinner on 20 April 1983 was the first major night time social function at the Complex and 123 people were catered for.

Fundraising has been very successful with the exception of the cropping project.

We have applied for a lease of Redbanks Reserve for the running of livestock.

The rubbish collection contract has proved very profitable and we have the contract again for the coming year.

The Woman’s Auxiliary was formed with office bearers: President, Mrs Bev. Kellock; Vice-President, Mrs Marg. Lloyd; Secretary, Mrs Barb Secomb and Treasurer, Mrs Elaine Eberhard.

Trees have been planted.

The old buildings have been demolished and removed and the area cleaned up.
