Kooringa News

There has been heavy rain in the last fortnight.  The grass is green and growing.  The main street is in an extremely dirty state.  As far as mud is concerned, it is worse now than it was before the filling up of the creek that previously ran down the street.  Water from the hill on the northern side now remains in pools in the middle of the street.

The Miners’ & Mechanics’ Institute progresses slowly, but in all likelihood will be completed in a few weeks.
