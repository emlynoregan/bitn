John I. Sangster Sen. writes a letter on the Burra Burra Mine.

Some time ago when the town was pointed out as being in decline, the mining company was floated and many, wishing to show their confidence in the venture and the town, put their money into it.  So far little has been done and the experiment to extract copper from the dump does not look promising.  Since then more families have left the town, the brewery has closed and the status of the hospital is reduced.  The Eastern Plains are again a failure and more of the surrounding country has passed into the hands of large land-owners.  Unless some new industry is forthcoming the drift will continue.  The closing of the Smelting Works has thrown a number out of employment.  The coming winter will be hard for many.  The mine is the only clear option and should be undertaken, even if little or no profit comes to shareholders.  There are, according to old miners, thousands of tons of payable ore close to hand in the open cut and if the water was lowered and a reasonable tribute exacted there would be work for a number of men.  Why not?  Someone competent should give a reliable opinion.  It seems the directors are happy to leave it to posterity.
