Burra High School held a break-up entertainment at the Institute 17 December.  There was a packed audience.  The concert was of a high standard and both students and teachers (Mr E.A.W. Haese & Misses Dunstone & Prior) deserve congratulations.  [The items are individually reviewed.]

Dr Steele presented the awards and also urged all parents of those who gained their Qualifying Certificates to send their children to Burra High School and for those with children there to send them back in 1932, especially if the alternative was idleness from unemployment.

[The school report and prize list was held over to be printed in a 1932 paper.]

[Personal interest: Clarrie Fuss played the part of a clown in excerpts from Shakespeareâ€™s What You Will.]
