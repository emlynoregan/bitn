Quite 50 years had passed since Methodism came to Redruth and its Jubilee would be celebrated on 15 June and the following days and it was hoped a genuine revival would emanate from it.  The old Primitive Methodist Church building was unsafe and it had been decided to take down the west wall and lengthen the building by ten feet.  The cost would be at least Â£130.   A special effort will be made to raise the money rather than borrow it.  The restored building will be known as the Methodist Jubilee Hall.
