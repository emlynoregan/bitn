Ulooloo Gold-field: from a correspondent of the Northern Argus.

The field is creating great excitement, but has not had much of a trial.  Many of the diggers are quite inexperienced and easily disheartened.  At present about 50 men are present and no doubt the field will give employment to hundreds during the winter.  Water is available in a perennial stream.   As far as I have ascertained no one has yet been very successful and the greatest quantity I have seen was only 2 dwt by two men in five days.
