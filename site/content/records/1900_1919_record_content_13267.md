Accident.  On Wednesday a wagon loaded with several tons of wire and drawn by a bullock team was crossing the railway line near Hillside about 3 miles north of Burra and going too near the edge of the formation, the front wheels sank.  A train was due, but there was nothing to be done, but wait for help.  A party on the way to Mt Bryan Sports appeared and W. Truscott & Charles Pearce ran along the line to try and stop the approaching train.  Those left behind tried to shift the wagon.  The train was met half a mile down the track and the driver slowed down.  In the meantime Messrs S. Lane & P. Gottschalk induced the animals to give a long pull and managed to clear the line.  The driver was Mr Jones.  [Check train or bullock driver?]
