Letter from ‘Municipal’.  Recently the Council has shown concern about the quality control of milk in Burra.  The quality is very good and it should be under the control of the Council, but they must first show they are capable of it, and judging by their action in meat inspection I would say don’t let them.  At present anyone can come in from outside and sell from uninspected carts.  Premises are not inspected.  The Food and Drug Act allows for the inspection of carts.  Four butchers in Burra pay licences and as many do not.  Why not enforce Clause 103 of the Health Act of 1898 re the approval of slaughterhouses?  Two other Corporations in SA enforce this and it ensures that meat is killed in an approved place. [Even if outside the Corporation area.]
