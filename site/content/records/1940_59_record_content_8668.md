AC1 Albert Sampson writes a letter home.  He is serving with the RAAF in Singapore. He says with plenty of work to do by day and black-outs at night, there is little chance to write.

He describes the first air raid over Singapore.

He says cigarettes are in short supply and laments that doing any shopping in Singapore is virtually impossible as by the hour he can get away the shops are shut.  He makes reference to Dutch submarines attacking Japanese troop carriers and also refers to stiff fighting in the Philippines and Kelantan (Northern Malaya).
