Characteristics of the 1915 Paper

Page 1 had large advertisements and sometimes a considerable amount of news, but not necessarily news of any more importance than that on other pages.

Page 2 had smaller advertisements and notices of sales and from Councils and various other public organisations.  Classified advertisements were very few.  This led to local news.  There was very rarely editorial comment.

Page 3.  This was a page largely of news, especially of the various efforts to support the war and also news from the surrounding districts.  The division between pages 2 and 3 was very fluid.

Page 4 carried both large and smaller advertisements, many of them local.  There was a varying amount of news, mostly of less importance and sometimes there was only advertisement.

The literary supplement continued as a loose double-sided sheet: see table.

The paper was dominated by war news with many letters from soldiers and especially the efforts of Burra and district to raise money for the various funds.  These efforts are reported at great length and with great care to acknowledge all financial donations, gift items and other assistance.  Jingoism is relatively restrained, but not entirely absent.  It naturally appears in reports of some of the stirring speeches at major events.

Numbering of issues in 1915

The apparent intention to begin each year with a new volume number breaks down.

The year began with Volume XXII Number 1926 on 6 January 1915.

And continued to Volume XXII Number 1975 on 24 November 1915.

Within this sequence numbers 1953, 1954 & 1955 were not used.

Presumably through an accident the volume number then changed:

Volume XXXII began with Number 1976 1 December 1915

And continued to Volume XXXII 1979 22 December 1915.
