Burra Motor Sporting Club held their first meeting on their new speedway at ‘Blink Bonnie’ on 25 February.  (On what was once known as Wildotta Lagoon, 6 miles west of Burra.)  The lake has water each winter till mid-summer, but provides an excellent race surface when dry of 1½ miles circumference.  £27 was taken at the gate.  Patron N.H. Pearse attended.  President Hedley McWaters was absent on a holiday in WA.  The program didn’t start till 3 p.m., but then went without a hitch.  The description of the races and results extends for about 1½ columns.

The riders were:

M. Hall (Harley)	B. Rogers (Norton)	Treloar (Harley)

R. Moore (Norton)	J. Williams (Calthorpe)	H. Morrison (AJS)
