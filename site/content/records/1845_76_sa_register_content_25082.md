The Wheat Blockade.  ‘One Who Also Counts the Trucks’ writes in reply to those complaining about the railways pointing out:

Where is the railway staff to come from for extra movements when the present staff are working 14-20 hours per day?

When would the locomotives be cleaned and/or repaired?

Is it prudent or possible to keep locomotives fired continually for weeks on end?

He then outlines the problems associated with handling the volume of what at the port; pointing out that there is no benefit in getting wheat to the wharf if it cannot be handled there more expeditiously.
