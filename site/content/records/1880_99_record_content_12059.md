A Political Meeting was held on 14 January, chaired by the Mayor, Dr Brummitt.  It was to consider local representation in Parliament.  The existing members, Rounsevell and Ward are likely to stand again.

Mr Lane thought Mr Rounsevell should give answers of his position on several matters.

Several men were proposed as possible candidates: Dr. J.R. Stephens, W.H. Duncan, Wentworth Cavanagh, C.R. Goode, Mr Ridgway, & S.D. Glyde.

Mr Ridgway said he would stand.

(Mr Bath was also suggested, but he is soon leaving for England.)

A committee will sound out these men and seek their views etc.  [F.W. Holder on the committee.]

Mr Holder moved the members try to get a railway line survey done from Burra to the Barrier at once.

T.W. Wilkinson moved the committee communicate with the Railway Commissioners to alter timetables to allow travel from the north to Wallaroo and vice versa without an overnight stay at Hamley Bridge.
