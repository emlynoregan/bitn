The Soldiers’ Aid Society is working hard doing similar kinds of work to the Red Cross.

Violet Day was a red letter day in Burra with the auction of a bunch of violets raising £384 and a total of £414 for the day.

Australia Day was the town’s best effort with £2,100 raised.

French Flag Day raised £608 for the French Red Cross.

On 13 October the town welcomed Sir Henry and Lady Galway.  Welcome arches were erected at the station gate, in Aberdeen and in Kooringa and the whole town was gaily decorated with flags and bunting.  Of the £805 collected £250 was sent to Adelaide toward the Cheer-up Hut while £550 was kept for the purpose of assisting wounded soldiers who may return to us later on.  The funds are still open to receive donations.

During the year the drought broke and heavy rains did much good, but consequent floods badly damaged roads, footpaths etc. and swept away three of our bridges: the one near Lord’s Hotel, one at the south end of town [presumably at the Pig and Whistle crossing] and one at the old White Hart Hotel at the north end of town.  We have received £350 special grant to repair roads and arrangements have been made to replace the bridges.  Plans and specifications have been received from the Government Engineer and tenders called for the first one to be built across the creek opposite the Burra Institute.

The town has been brought under the Building Act which will prevent the erection of unsightly buildings in the town.  It has also been placed under the Places of Public Entertainment Act which provides for means of safety in places of entertainment in the event of fire or panic.

For many years Burra has been totally unprovided for in the event of fire.  In the last 12 months there have been several outbreaks.  In most cases we were fortunate to control the fires before much damage was done, but in one case considerable loss of property resulted.  The Council has now purchased hydrants, a hose and a hand reel and have organised a volunteer fire brigade.

The Burra Band continues to make progress and has rendered great service to the various patriotic committees by responding to their appeals for help.  Mr James Bentley has resigned from the leadership and Mr A.G. Shortridge has taken his place.

Rates collected:	General	£437-15-4

Parklands	£73-2-10

Health	£255-5-6

Lighting	£109-6-11

Total outstanding rates	£12-19-4

The general account began the year £24-18-9 in debit and is now £68-0-3 in credit.

North Ward began £24-15-2 in debt and is now £11-2-7 in debt.

East Ward began £0-8-7 in debt and is now £23-13-4 in credit.

West Ward began £4-0-10 in credit and is now £38-4-2 in credit.

Parklands.  In the year all dead trees were removed and hundreds of young trees, mainly pines, were planted, but unfortunately not with great success.  A new garden is being planted in Ludgvan St.  There is a plan to plant the eastern side of the Creek.

Cemetery.  Mr H. Wilson has been appointed curator and when not employed there he attends to the various garden plots and other general work.  This arrangement has been a success.

The main roads continue to be maintained and two sections have been added: Sara’s Corner to the junction with the Mt Bryan Road and the length from the Bon Accord Corner to the western boundary of the Corporation.  The grant this year was £430.  The special grant is still in credit £135-0-8.

Tar paving was proceeded with during the year and extension of it is intended.  Though expensive to begin with it is the cheapest way to manage main roads in the long run.

During the year our Health Officer, Dr J.I. Sangster, died.  Dr Steele took over until his departure on active service and now Dr Williams carries out the duty.  The present balance of £34-15-4 is needed in case of any outbreak of infectious disease.

Mr George Lawn has been permanent scavenger – previous appointments by tender had generally proved unsatisfactory.  The Council purchased its own horse and dray for the purpose.

Health Officer’s Report.  There was an outbreak of enteric fever [typhoid] early in the year and then little infectious disease.  There were three cases of chicken pox and one of tuberculosis.  The typhoid outbreak was of 12 cases, mostly in March and April.

Electric light continued to be discussed by Council, but at this time it was thought inopportune and the Council decided to wait for an easier money market after the war.  Of the rates of £109-8-5, carbide cost £41-19-1 and the lighting of lamps cost £50-14-0.

The new reservoir erected by the side of the old one has assured the town of adequate water supply in the future.
