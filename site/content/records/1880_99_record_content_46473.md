Football.  Broken Hill visited on Monday last, having played a series of matches in Adelaide.

Burra		0.0	1.0	1.3	2.10

Broken Hill	2.2	2.2	2.2	2.2

[Comment suggests that this was regarded as a draw: ‘the home team made things equal with the visitors.]

The game was played in almost continuous rain with only a brief break of sun and the visitors were praised for their good behaviour.  The description runs to 2¼ columns.
