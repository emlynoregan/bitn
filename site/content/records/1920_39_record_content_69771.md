Brian Riggs of Prince Alfred College obtained six subjects at the recent Intermediate Examinations with three credits.  He also passed second year wool-classing at the School of Mines.

[Note that later in the same article it says he will go on to take Leaving Honours this year, which indicates the reference above should refer to the Leaving Examination; not the Intermediate.  This is confirmed in the paper of 1 March, page 2.]
