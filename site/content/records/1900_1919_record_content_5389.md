Rev. W.F. James was ordered a complete holiday and he now reports on his trip to Melbourne.  He boarded his ship at Largs Bay, apparently taking a launch out to the India.  He went to Brighton (Melbourne) for a week, where he stayed with 82 year-old Mr Quick who had served at a mission in Sierra Leone 60 years before. He also spent time with Rev. E.H. Sugden at Queen’s College, Melbourne.  He attended the First United Methodist Conference in Melbourne and spent five days with Rev. D. Daly, Secretary of the Federal Council.
