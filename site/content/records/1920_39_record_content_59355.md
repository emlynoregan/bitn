Burra Cycling & Athletic Club held its annual sports day on 26 December at the Burra Racecourse.  With a record crowd of spectators, gate takings were £26 compared with £15 last year.  Weather was ideal with a slight southerly wind.  The tracks were in first class order.  The publican’s booth had a radio so the racing enthusiasts could keep in touch with the Cheltenham races.  Local identity B. Thomson carried off the honours in the two-mile Mid-North Race.  Stafford won the 1 mile and the 1½ mile wheel races and a wheel race for locals was won by Rex Opperman.  I.R. Burton won the 220 yard and 440 yard handicaps in the pedestrian events, with E.S. Chellew winning the 75 yard sprint and the 130 yard Sheffield.  In the afternoon the Burra District Band under Bandmaster J.H. Murison enlivened the proceedings.  [Results are printed.]
