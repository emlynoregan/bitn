Platoon of 27th Scottish to be formed in Burra

Before the War and for some time during it, there was a Light Horse Troop in Burra – part of the 9/23 Light Horse Regiment.  When horses went out of date the regiment was disbanded, but the troops were well trained and when called upon joined the mechanised regiments, where they found they knew the drill and tactics applicable to tanks as being similar to that used by Light Horsemen.

A group of recruiting officers visited Burra last Tuesday with the object of forming a platoon in Burra to form part of the 27th Scottish Battalion.  The Mayor opened proceedings and introduced Lieut. Campbell, who had been selected to be in charge of the Burra Platoon.

Lieut. Campbell said the Platoon would be part of the CMF and most of the training would probably be carried out at night.  There would be two parades every fortnight – one voluntary and one compulsory and 14 days of continuous training during the year.  Members would be paid military rates of pay.  A full Platoon numbered 36, but 12 would do as a nucleus to start with.  Men in the age range 18-35 were required.

The 27th Scottish is an infantry battalion and before the war was considered to be the crack SA Regiment.  During the war it saw much service in Syria and New Guinea.  It is now being reformed, with its Headquarters at Pt Pirie and Company Headquarters at Clare.
