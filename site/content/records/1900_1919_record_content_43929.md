Burra Cheer-up Society.

On 2 Nov. there was a welcome for visiting wounded soldiers L-Cpl Bennetts and Ptes Edmondson & Higgins.  Pte Alf Isaac was farewelled.

4 Nov. about 40 members went to Adelaide by the morning train to participate in opening of the Cheer-up Hut in Adelaide.  At noon they were given lunch by the Adelaide Cheer-up Society and after lunch they paraded the main streets mounted on their horses before forming a guard of honour for the Governor and Lady Galway.  In the evening they were again at the Hut, where a number of soldiers were entertained.

6 Nov. there was a farewell social for Ptes W. Herbert & R. Winders and for Troopers Lloyd Pearce, Eric Vivian, will Brown, Tom Brown, L. McGowan and Albert Dunning.

(Half of them from Hampton.)  Three other soldiers were given parcels: Sgt Wadmore & Ptes Trevilyan and Przibilla.  The first two sent their regrets at not being able to attend.
