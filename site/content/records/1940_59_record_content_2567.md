Burra Town Council, 8 July.

Cr Samuel was welcomed as senior Councillor for West Ward, having previously represented East Ward.

There was then a debate on the Mayoral Allowance.  Cr Harvey thought that £30 was too little and that £40 would not be too much.  Cr Reed thought the allowance should be increased as in wartime the Mayor had duties which he did not have in normal times.  Cr Terry thought the town should economise in times of stress and strife and would not go over £35.  The Town Clerk was asked and said Mr Crewes received £50 during the last war.  Eventually £40 was approved.

A letter was received advising that Mr Gregory was compiling costs related to reopening the mine.

Mrs J. Tennant wrote re National Tree Planting for trees of tribute, saying that the Burra Tree Planting Committee was defunct, but she would see the matter discussed at the CWA meeting and suggested discussion with the Soldiers’ Farewell Committee and a motion to that effect was carried.

Committees for the coming year were appointed.

Cr terry said he assumed the swimming pool had been shelved for the duration of the war and moved that the money from the pool committee be invested in War Savings Certificates.  Carried.
