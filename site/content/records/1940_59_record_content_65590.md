Weather.  A severe thunderstorm struck Burra North between 2 and 3.30 a.m. on Monday.  The storm was felt in a strip from Booborowie to Burra North before continuing to the east.  Burra North recorded up to 150 points while Burra recorded 80 points for the weekend.  Booborowie had 109 points and Redcliffe reported nearly 200.  Most local problems occurred along the small creeks running down from the old Reformatory area and at the reserve near the playground.  Dick James had water and debris 2 to 3 feet high along the back of his home and his woodheap and other timber in the yard was carried away.  Les Nourse lost 13 pullets drowned in the rush of water.  Rex Opperman has silt about a foot deep over his garden.  Mr Watts had his new pit for car maintenance filled with water and water rose to the doors of a car over it.  Miss Jean Watts and her mother went to check on their animals etc. and found themselves in waist deep water in their back yard.  Road and culverts near the Court House were severely damaged.  Water over the Pig & Whistle Crossing was 4 to 6 feet deep and Firewood Creek also flowed strongly.
