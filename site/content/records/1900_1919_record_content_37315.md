Burra Town Council

The Burra Institute wrote asking Council to share the cost of the telephone.  Agreed.

The Commissioner of Crown Lands has authorised the installation of electric light in Burra.

The Chief Secretary is in communication with the Hospital Board regarding making the Mayor an ex officio member of the board.

C.J. Pearce & Sons’ tender for the footbridge in Redruth was accepted at £27-12-6.

Cr Parks moved for the removal of trees from the reserve in Chapel St and for it to be levelled so it could be planted.

Cr Parks moved for the removal of pickets from around Lane Garden and substitution of wire netting to improve the view.  Carried.

Cr Harris said he would like some action re tar-dressing of roads which was very satisfactory in Petersburg.
