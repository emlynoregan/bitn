Sir Frederick Holder has been remembered with the naming of a new metropolitan electorate for the House of Representatives after him.  He was closely connected with Burra.  He was born 12 May 1850, the son of Morecott Holder of Happy Valley and trained as a teacher.  He felt that journalism would hold greater opportunities and while still a young man secured possession of the Burra Record.  He was described as a ‘trenchant and graceful’ writer and contributed to the Adelaide Register and high class English newspapers.  He became Town Clerk of Burra from 1879 to 1884 and was Mayor in 1887. [And 1889.]  In 1887 he was elected to the House of Assembly and two years later was first Treasurer in Sir John Cockburn’s cabinet.  He was Premier of SA briefly in 1892 and for 1899-1901.  In 1901 he was made a Knight Commander of St Michael & St George.  When the Commonwealth was established he became the first Speaker of the House of Representatives.  He was a greatly respected Speaker, known for his fairness and the dignified way he carried out his duties. He collapsed at his post with an apoplectic seizure at 6.30 a.m. on 23 July 1909 following a strenuous all-night sitting on the subject of the old age pension.  He died at 4 p.m. the same day without regaining consciousness.  Thousands lined the route of his state funeral in Adelaide on 26 July despite torrential rain.
