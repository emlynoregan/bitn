Editorial.  At the meeting of the Burra Council on 6 March four of the six Councillors refused to allow business to proceed until the Mayor’s report had been expunged.  Utter confusion then prevailed.  The Mayor left the chair which was taken by Cr Linkson. Crs Parks, Walsh and West then completed the business of the Council, but no cheques were signed.

Cr Walsh asked the Mayor: ‘Will Your Worship supply me with a copy of the new standing orders for my guidance in this Council?’

‘We have none.’ Said the Mayor.

This is strange because in January he had said he would read a clause from the new standing orders.  These so-called new standing orders turned out to be the property of the Adelaide Corporation.

An extraordinary special meeting of Council has since been called and dealt with financial matters.
