Obituary of H. Tralaggan.

Mr Henry Tralaggan died 23 September at his home in Redruth.  He had been born at the Reedbeds SA 13 August 1841.  His father, Frederick Tralaggan, took up land at Mintaro and later in 1869 at Mt Bryan with varying success.  For 16 years he was a member of the Mt Bryan DC and was Chairman for several years.  He was also a member of the School Board of Advice and an ardent Methodist.  He was the founder of the Razorback Chapel, which was dismantled in 1884, after which he attended the Mt Bryan Church, holding every office over the years.  He retired to Redruth about ten years ago and became a teacher at the Redruth Methodist Sunday School.  He married Miss Mary Montgomery, daughter of Mr & Mrs Sampson Montgomery, in August 1863.  There are two sons and three daughters: Fred (Mt Bryan East), Isaac (Mt Bryan), Mrs James Bass (Hallett), Mrs Joseph Causby (Gawler) & Mrs Elliott Bell (Hallett).  There are 17 grandchildren.
