Salvation Army.  Adjutant G. Austin, his wife and family were farewelled from the barracks on Tuesday evening.  They have been transferred to Solomontown.  Rev. R.H. Lee took the chair.  E.W. Crewes thanked the Adjutant for his interest in the meeting of the Fellowship of the Kingdom held on Saturday evenings and on alternate Sunday evenings after church in Market Square and Best Place, Aberdeen.  The presentation was an inkstand and pen and a wallet of money.

[Personal interest: among the accompanying entertainment items were two songs by Mr Robert Fuss.]

On Wednesday evening Adjutant and Mrs Shinn were welcomed at the barracks and Mr E.W. Crewes took the chair.
