Obituary/Memorial Service

A service to honour James McGilchrist was held at the Kooringa Methodist Church on Sunday.  Many Freemasons attended â€“ the deceased having been a Past Master of the Naracoorte Lodge.  Deceased was a son of a Presbyterian minister, the late Rev. John McGilchrist and his brother, Rev. W. McGilchrist, is a minister of the Church of Scotland at Ardrossan in the UK.  Deceased came to Australia 50 years ago and after some time in other states settled in Naracoorte, where he was active in the Presbyterian Church, but after some time circumstances arose which saw him transfer for over nine years to the Anglican Church.  When he came to Burra he worshipped at the Kooringa Methodist Church.
