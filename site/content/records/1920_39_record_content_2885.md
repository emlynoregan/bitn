Literary Supplements to the 1920 paper.

These have not been preserved in either the hard copy or on microfilm with the exception on microfilm of that for 3 March.  This reveals a similar format to that of the previous few years.

There was a short story: A Problem Picture by Elsie M. Cooper.

The serialised novel was Wheels Within Wheels by Frank Howell Evans, within which chapter XVIII was credited to Gladys Raymes.

The other topics were: For Women, From all Parts, Humour, Housekeeper and Farm & Field.
