Centenary Week Window Displays

The town’s businessmen excelled themselves in the Window Dressing Competition.

Most Suitable Window for Type of Business was won by Mr Donald P. Kerr, Grocer.

Coloured groceries had been arranged to form an intricately patterned carpet, backed by a large bank of flowers.

Most Artistically Decorated Shop Premises went to Bence’s Ltd.

One window reflected the fashions of 1845 and the second the snappy designs of the latest millinery and frocks.  Masses of flowers filled large cement jardinières in front of the premises.

Messrs Sara & Co. of Burra North won Best Centenary Window.  This window depicted the activities in Burra in the mining days and through to the present day with wheat and wool industries.

Other windows of note included:

Matthews Emporium – an artistic modern design

Bachli Bros – Burra Mine in sponge cake and biscuits

H.J.B. Jennison – the old Burra Mine and specimens of malachite

E.T. Baulderstone – fruit and ice-creams

Burra Motor Co. – a garden effect and children’s party

Many other premises featured flowers and flags.
