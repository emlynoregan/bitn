Burra Town Council

Sympathy was expressed to Cr Sampson who recently lost his brother.

The Mayor reported moving Cr Sampson’s motion at the Municipal Assoc. calling for an enquiry into the validity of standing orders of Council.

Mr Holder reports that unless the Council will forgo the main road grant or make other contributions of a like nature the Government will not proceed with the Bon Accord Bridge.

With reference to the Bon Accord railway crossing he could get no definite reply as the Chairman of Commissioners was not in.

In reference to the [Waterworks] boiler he had seen Messrs May Bros. and they would be able to complete repairs and send it on during the week.

The secretary of the Municipal Assoc. advised extreme caution in proceeding to sell vacant allotments, considering it a risky thing to do.

The Finance Committee has prepared a list of vacant allotments on which rates are unpaid.  The matter will be held over for the present.  The Town Clerk will attempt to find the names of owners.

Cr Butterworth moved that the lamp in North Ward be shifted to the other side of the road.  Carried.

As a result of the Institute Committee saying they were not prepared to pay their share of the cost of an iron urinal, but would pay their share of erecting one on the terms first submitted them by the Board of Health notice is to be given to them to erect a urinal in accordance with the Health Act.
