Burra Town Council, 15 March

Council considered an appeal from Messrs Halls & Bevan about cab licence refunds in committee.

Aberdeen Tennis Club asked Council to quote for the reconstruction of four of its courts.  The club offered to repay in 10 yearly instalments.

Cr Dow said it was not for the Council to pay.  The work could be done at cost, but had to be paid for.  If he could remember correctly the club already owed £20.

The Mayor agreed.  There was no guarantee the club would be around in 10 years.  Council will quote for the work.

The Town Clerk reported that there were no tenders for swimming pool construction.

Present arrears of rates were £200.

Kakoschke’s Bridge to be repaired as soon as possible, as it was getting dangerous.

Burra Benevolent Society met on Friday.  President Rev. J.P.H. Tilbrook was absent and Rev. A. Dyer took the chair.  Several appeals for help were answered with aid in goods; not money.  Footwear is much needed.
