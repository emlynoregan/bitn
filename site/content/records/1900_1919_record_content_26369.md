Local Option Poll

Rev. John Paterson spoke to a fair number of people at the Institute on this question.  Rev. T. Weatherill presided.  He referred to recent disgraceful scenes in Adelaide where an organised mob threw eggs at a meeting organised to promote local option.  ‘The drink traffic was a curse, and should be wiped off the face of the earth.’  Local option was not the idea of a few cranks as alleged by some.  He referred to efforts in Iceland and Switzerland and to New Zealand licensing laws.  He illustrated his appeal for abstinence with anecdotes of various people’s paths of self destruction.  E.J. Davey moved the vote of thanks which was seconded by Mr Sara.
