A new scheme is required and the visit by the Conservator of Water this week may result in some alteration.  A pump at one of the fine wells in the town would be better and more of a certainty.  We have a real opportunity at present as we are not burdened by a lease of the works: though we might have been had the Government gone about its business in a businesslike manner.  As the water level in the Waterworks is still falling there is no promise that we will not soon be without it altogether.
