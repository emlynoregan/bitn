Burra Floods

Thunderstorms on Tuesday evening brought 24.8 mm in less than one hour.  On Saturday came a heavier downpour.  Outlets were unable to cope and some minor flooding of streets occurred.  At about 1 p.m. the creek past the hospital overflowed at the Commercial Road Bridge.  Commercial Street was rapidly covered in muddy water, which flooded parts of Chapel, Queen and Thames Streets.  Some Commercial Street premises were flooded and others escaped.  The rainfall for the week was 68.8 mm.  The rainfall for April so far is 164.6 mm or 650 points and the highest ever was in 1889 when 830 points were recorded.

[This would seem to be a totally inadequate report of the extent of this flood, give the volume of water mentioned.  It extends for no more than Â¼ column.]
