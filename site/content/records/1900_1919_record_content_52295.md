When the Corporation bought the Hospital from SAMA in 1877 the people subscribed £500 and a condition of transfer was it was to be used as a hospital: a condition hardly being met.

The real purpose of the hospital was to treat the poor, which was why there was a Government grant.  If Dr Ashton’s services had been dispensed with why had he been appointed Hon. Surgeon a few days later?  Has the Board approached Dr Ashton with a view to a settlement?

Mr P. Roach: Wasn’t Dr Ashton invited to attend Board meetings?
