Burra Town Council, 19 April

E.J. Harris was given permission to erect a wood and iron garage in Chapel St and a petrol tank opposite his shop.

Council resolved to try to get control of the Ballast Quarry from the Government and to use it for road screenings.

The Inspector suggested approaching the SAR to make a separate outlet and inlet at the railway station to relieve congestion.  Council agreed if the Commissioner of Railways will bear the cost.

The question of moving the guns was deferred to the next meeting.
