Mongolata Gold

A number of men have been prospecting to the east and one locality tried has been Mr George Morganâ€™s Mongolata property and a promising gold-bearing reef has been found.  The reef of ironstone and quartz showed unmistakably good coarse gold.  On Monday Messrs Byles Sen. & Jnr took half a kerosene tin of specimens to Adelaide for assay.  Several of the best specimens were almost on the surface.  Two parties have found gold on adjacent claims.  Let us hope the find is a really big one.
