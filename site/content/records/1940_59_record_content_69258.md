[Tom Kellaway features in an article by Allan Reval in a daily newspaper, an extract from which is printed.]

‘Kellaway was the most powerful knockout I have ever seen.  It was not unusual for him to punch the ball well into the forward lines.’  This knocking was not aimless: it enabled Bob Quinn and Allan Revel to get mobile before their opponents.  To what extent his work was capitalised upon can be seen in 1938 when Bob Quinn won the Magarey Medal with Allan Revel in fourth place.

‘I class him as the best rucksman I have teamed with in club football.’

‘All in all Tom Kellaway typified the enthusiasm and unselfishness of what should be a part of all footballers – truly a team man.’

[Born 29 September 1911, Tom Kellaway had a varied, but very successful sporting and athletic career as a youth in Burra and went to Port Adelaide FC in 1932.]
