Burra Mine.  Major H.C.R. Batchelor of Gilberton recently wrote to the Advertiser and the following is from Vox’s column of 20 February.

The Major says that soon after the mine closed in the 1870s and before the water had risen his father took him down into the open cut where an old miner pointed out a large wall of unripe copper.  He said it was likely to be matured in about 50 years.  The old miner said there was more copper remaining than had been taken out.  He said great wealth lay to the southwest towards or from ‘Rance’s Shaft’.  He remembers as a boy watching miners jigging copper, both blue and green from sands washed down Burra Creek.
