National Threatened Species Day is celebrated on 7 September â€“ the anniversary of the day the last Tasmanian tiger died.

In SA the 4th National Day in 1998 will focus on the Pygmy Bluetongue Lizard.  Following its rediscovery in 1992, inside a dead brown snake, after an absence of 30 years, a search has revealed ten small populations, with numbers now estimated at 5,500.  They live in trapdoor wolf spider holes and can live for at least eight years in the wild.  A public talk on the species will be held in Burra on 23 September.
