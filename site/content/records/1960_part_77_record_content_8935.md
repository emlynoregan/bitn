Cricket

Koonoona defeated Burra 162

Scores unclear, but Buffs defeated Farrell Flat

Some Notes by ‘12th Man’ reveal that the Burra Footballers entered the Mokota Association late and had neither a home ground nor any money.  They soon acquired a debt of £70, but hope to pay it off within two weeks.

Burra Footballers 148 & 83 defeated Booborowie 116.  (A win on the first innings.)
