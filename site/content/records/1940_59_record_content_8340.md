Obituary.  Mr C. Claude Pascoeâ€™s death was announced last Thursday.  He was the second surviving son of the late Mr R.D. & Mrs Pascoe and was born at Kooringa 42 years ago.  He married Miss Auriel Dormer, daughter of Mrs John Kemble of Burra, who is left with a family of five young children: Dick, Max, Trevor, Joy and Yvonne.  He left Burra a few months ago to take up a position in Adelaide, but the family remained here.

J.P.H. Tilbrook writes a tribute to Claude Pascoe.

He had a rare soul in a body that was not of the strongest.  He was the soul of courtesy and struggled valiantly against the disabilities and physical circumstances that were a heavy handicap.

[Cuthbert Claude Pascoe was born 27 December 1899 at Kooringa and died 11 December 1941 at Adelaide, residence Mile End.]
