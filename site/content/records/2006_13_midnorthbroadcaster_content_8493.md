Bike for Bibles in Burra.  Twenty-five members of Bike for Bibles had a rest day in Burra during their 4053 km hike across Australia with the aim of raising $100,000 to be used to support the Bible Society Australian Mission projects.  They are riding from Perth to Sydney.  The ladies of the church provided a pooled lunch and some of the local children made a large Bike for Bibles cake.  This is the 25th anniversary of the movement, which began when three riders went from Sydney to Melbourne and raised $2,000 for the Bible Society.
