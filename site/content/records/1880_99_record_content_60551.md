Drew & Crewes v. J. Reynolds.

Drew & Crewes had used J. Sampson, bailiff, to seize a horse to satisfy a claim against Mr Reynolds for £6-4-11.  Mr Reynolds claimed the horse was hers.  George Parks said he had sold her the horse for £10-10-0 and identified the horse in question.  The receipt had been made out in her name.

Mildred Reynolds said it was her horse, paid for with her money and entered in the Burra Races in her name.  She had engaged the jockey.

A.E.A. Hobby, horse trainer, said Mr Reynolds had spoken of it as his horse and told Hobby it was his and only in his wife’s name so it could not be seized.  [Other evidence was given of Reynolds paying other costs associated with the horse.]

The SM said in such relationships separate ownership had to be very distinctly proved which had not been done convincingly enough.   The verdict was for the execution creditors with costs.
