Ulooloo Diggings.  A digger named Dearlove was in Clare on Wednesday with 3 oz of gold as his share for four week’s work.  He has returned to the field and has done better than anyone else from the Clare area.  A number of farmers have now left the diggings to undertake ploughing and prepare for sowing.  Not more than 200 remain, of whom about 60 are in Coglin’s Gully.  Earnings here are from 12/- to £3-10-0 per week.  Wash-dirt from here has to be carted three miles at accost of 2/- per dray load.  Fortunately food is not expensive and a man who does without grog may get by on 8/- a week.  Diggers have been more attentive to work in recent weeks.  It is said the grogshop now barely pays, though at first it was selling 10 hogsheads a week.  The diggings now have about 100 tents, 200 persons, 1 store and 1 grogshop.
