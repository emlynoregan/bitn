Football.  At Hallett on Saturday Hallett 39 apparently defeated Kooringa 5, though elsewhere in the text it says that Kooringa kicked ‘only 4 behinds against Hallett’s 4 goals 15 bhds’.

The road back was so bad they had to dismount from the motor lorry 5 miles the other side of Mt Bryan.  The players walked to Mt Bryan and sent for a relief vehicle.  Some walked right through.

At Aberdeen on Saturday both teams played one man short (17) and Aberdeen 10.25 (85) defeated Mt Bryan 0.5 (5)
