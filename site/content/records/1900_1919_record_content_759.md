Burra Town Council

A footbridge is to be erected in St Dye St, Redruth.

The Engineer-in-Chief has asked for the new Waterworks lease forwarded in Nov. 1898 to be sealed and returned.

Boer War.  The Transvaal Patriotic Fund stands now at £185.

Burra Slag Extraction Co.  Mr C.A. Lott was severely injured in an accident on Monday morning.  Heavy castings were being unloaded when a casting slipped over the side of the skids causing a piece of timber 6” x 4” x 18’ to fly through the air, grazing his cheek, and knocking him down, breaking his collarbone.  Immediately the shifting weight of the casting caused the timber to be brought down on top of Mr Lott, breaking three ribs.  Had he not fallen in a small gutter he would probably have been crushed to death.  The victim was badly bruised and his face and neck were swollen almost beyond recognition.  Although very painful, the injuries are now mending.

An Accident.  On Wednesday evening Mrs Scott, the wife of James Scott of Iron Mine, was returning home from Burra with her sister, Miss J. Fairchild, when her horse was frightened by the train and the pair were thrown out of the trap at Cobb & Co.’s Corner.  Miss Fairchild scrambled out from under the trap and struggling horse, but Mrs Scott was thrown clear and suffered concussion.  She is recovering in the Burra Hospital.

An Accident.  Mrs George Langsford was thrown from her trap a few days ago and received a fractured collarbone.

Indian Famine Relief Fund.  A public meeting has been called for 4 April at 7.30 p.m. in the Council Chambers to arrange matters to aid the Indian famine in which thousands are starving.  The Record will take charge and acknowledge the receipt of donations in the paper’s columns.

Dr Brummitt was farewelled in the Institute last Friday evening.  The mayor, E.W. Crewes presided.  He listed the Doctor’s activities as:	Mayor for four years

Justice of the Peace

Treasurer of the Burra Institute

Member of the Agricultural Soc. [Burra Show Soc.]

Chairman of the School Board of Advice

President of the British and Foreign Bible Society

Chairman of the Burra Jubilee Benevolent Society

He also gave much time to the Burra Hospital

He was presented with an illuminated address.

P. Lane endorsed the remarks of the Mayor and added that Dr Brummitt had been foremost in the tree planting in the town.

Speeches were also given by E.C. Lockyer, Dr Sangster, R.M. Harvey, Mr Winnall, T.W. Wilkinson, S. James (who spoke as the town’s oldest resident), C.J. Pearce (on behalf of the IOR), J. Lane, and Rev. W.G. Clarke.  The Doctor then responded.
