He said all I had to do for him was to drive the cart as gently as possible; which I did.  When I first saw him he looked like a healthy man, but I noticed he breathed with difficulty.

Dr Maurau:

I examined the body of the deceased Charles Wolfe.  I found no marks of violence.  The body has the appearance of a person who has been ill two or three weeks.  I have heard the evidence of Israel Lowe and believe the appearance of the body corroborates his account of the illness and death of the deceased.  I believe the deceased died from inflammation of the lungs and has probably had a disease of the lungs and perhaps also of the heart, for some time.  I have not moral doubt that he died from natural causes.  The jury returned a verdict of death by the visitation of God, but also commented that there had been neglect with regard to seeking medical aid.

[The SA Deaths CD must be in error in recording the death of Charles Wolfe as 28 February [sic] 1862 at Gottlieb’s Well North, residence Winnininnie aged 30.]
