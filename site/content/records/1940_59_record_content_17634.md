Forced Landing near Mt Bryan

A pilot made a forced landing at dusk on Friday at Mt Bryan.  He landed in a fallow paddock, but unfortunately struck a soft patch just on pulling up and the plane stood on its nose and bent the propeller, but overall little damage was done.  Two other machines have landed since to inspect the damage and it is hoped to repair the machine here.
