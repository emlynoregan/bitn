Mt Bryan East Public School held its picnic 19 November in Messrs Thomas & Gare’s paddock about two miles from the school with plenty of shade and water.  All kinds of sport were played by both students and adults.  A ladies v. gentlemen cricket match was regarded as great fun when the men had to wear women’s apparel and use a pick-handle as a bat.  Walking blindfolded for the rooster in the box was one of the most amusing events and the bird was won by Mr B.H.K. Dunstan.  He gave it back to be contested for by the ladies and it was then won by Mrs B.H.K. Dunstan who also gave it back to be tried for by the younger ladies and this time it went to Miss G. Taylor.
