Burra Town Council, 4 August

Cr S.J. Woollacott wanted the question of a military flame-thrower put on the next meeting of the Mid-North Local Government Assoc.

The Under-Treasurer notified his approval of the transfer of £400 to the Burra War Memorial Project.

SAR advises it was not practical for a railcar to run Adelaide-Terowie on Wednesday due to a lack of both railcars and staff.

The CWA asks for a meeting to draw up the necessary lease agreement.

Permission was granted to Mr W. Hawson Clark to erect a wood and iron shed for a laundry in Ayre [sic] St 15ft x 9ft to replace a dilapidated old building on the site.

W.J. Robins asked to erect an iron & wood wash house 12ft x 9ft in Kingston St to replace an old building.  Granted under supervision of the Town Clerk.

District War Memorial Committee granted use of the Town Council Account: it ‘illiminate’ sales tax [sic]

C. Lomman complains of straying stock at night in Hampton.  The Ranger to take action.

Council supported the Mayor’s decision not to support the Miss Australia Contest, as they were in the middle of a War Memorial Scheme.

A.B. Aldam wanted three trees removed in Thames St, as they block certain views and signs of his new garage.  Council will inspect when the building is completed.
