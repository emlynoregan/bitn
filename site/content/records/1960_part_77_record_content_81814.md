Rural Landowners have been asked to submit examples of interference to their private property tights by Government Departments and others.  The enquiry was initiated by the Burra District Committee of the SA Stockowners’ Association and supported by the United Farmers and Graziers of SA.  Examples are the Heysen Trail, acquisition by the Coastal Protection Board and interference in the sale and transfer of leases.
