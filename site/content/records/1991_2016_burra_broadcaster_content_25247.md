Hallett Power Station

Power retailer AGL plans to diversify into power generation by building a 250 megawatt power station 16 km west of Hallett.  It will help alleviate the critical peak power supply situation in SA and help avoid the very high marginal costs of peak demand periods.  The proposed site is c. 2 km north of Canowie on the Booborowie-Jamestown Road, with access to the Moomba-Adelaide natural gas pipeline and high tension power lines from Jamestown.  AGL expects 50% of the capacity to be operational by next summer.  AGL has addressed the Goyder Council, seeking its co-operation in subdividing the 20 ha required and in speeding up the other processes.  The plant would be fired up when electricity was in high demand â€“ characteristically when heat produces a spike in demand due to air conditioning.  It is anticipated it would run for 300-400 hours per annum.  The project is to cost c. $50 million.
