Burra Rifle Club: Captain’s report for 1949

The year had been very successful.  E.C. Collins donated £5 for P.W. Hogan’s 105 off the rifle and the club presented a medal.  25 possibles had been recorded for the year.

The visit to the Metropolitan Club at the Dean Range had been very enjoyable and the return visit was also very successful.  The annual triangular match between Pt Pirie, Peterborough & Burra had to be postponed from Eight Hour Day due to rain and ended up being played just between Burra & Pt Pirie with Pt Pirie being the victors.

Riverton & Spalding visited Burra and Burra won on both occasions.  Burra came fourth in the Country Teams contest at Dean Range.

Elected: Captain, D.H. Field; Vice-Captain, E.C. Hopkins; Secretary, R.G. Bernhardt; Treasurer, P.W. Hogan.  E.C. Collins & A.B. Riggs were elected as Life Members.
