Burra Regional Art Gallery is in crisis.  While it has a good number of enthusiastic volunteers to run the gallery on a day to day basis, it needs an injection on manpower on the Board to continue the excellent management of the past.  It needs people to organise/curate exhibitions, to oversee a social program for the Friends of the Gallery, to send out newsletters, to manage the volunteer roster and to organise the ‘hanging’ committee etc.  Key people have been lost, leading to the current crisis.  If positions cannot be filled soon, its activities will have to be curtailed or it could even have to close its doors altogether.
