The EPA will monitor low frequency noise at the Waterloo Wind Farm in April.  Associate Professor Dr Con Doolan from the University of Adelaide’s School of Mechanical Engineering reported on tests conducted inside homes within a few kilometres of turbines.  The report by Dr Doolan states that there is a close connection between the resident’s episodic symptoms of annoyance and certain low frequencies.  He said monitoring would be undertaken to determine if current wind farm guidelines gave adequate consideration to noise issues.  Not everyone is affected, but some people are greatly affected and appear to have significant issues with them.  We are trying to understand that better.
