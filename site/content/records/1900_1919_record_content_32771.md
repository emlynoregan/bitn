The Burra Show was held on Friday at Aberdeen in splendid weather.  Attendance was good and the exhibits above average.  The alteration from Wednesday to Friday was because other shows were on the Wednesday.  The horse section was weak.  Produce was plentiful.  Poultry entries were down, but the quality was up.  Dogs were well in evidence.  The sheep were, as usual, magnificent.  Implements were good.  Ah Chin secured most of the prizes for vegetables.  The gate took over £80.

In the evening the Edwards-Harding Dramatic Company staged A Woman’s Temptation at the Institute, which increased the show funds by over £30.
