Australia Day Awards for Burra.  A good crowd assembled under the pines. The Burra citizen of the year is Pauline Venning.  She has been engaged with a large number of organisations since coming to Burra.  These include the Leisure Activities group, Daycare Fundraising, the Op Shop, Rural Watch, Spastic Centre (Miss SA), The Burra Bowling Club, the Uniting Church, Red Cross, the Burra Show Society, Pets for Therapy and Domiciliary Care.  She is a compassionate person who is caring and generous and who has worked hard at making our community a better place in which to live.

The year’s Community Event was judged to be the Burra Community School’s 120/20 Concert.  This superb effort to celebrate the 120th birthday of public education in Burra and 20 years of the Community School was a great achievement of the students.  Year 11 students did the research to establish information about each decade, which was then written into a script to be read out by the Year 10 & 11 presenters on the night.  Students from R to year 9 learnt the songs and dances to be performed.  The effort involved all the school’s 270 students apart from Year 12, the staff and a host of parents as well as the group Triomore.
