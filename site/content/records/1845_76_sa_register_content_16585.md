Mintaro News, 27 April

There have been rains here, which though gladdening the hearts of farmers, have rendered the roads almost impassable.  Their condition is due to the absence of any local council and a memorial is being circulated urging His Excellency to form a District Council here.

The miller is adding to his property here, which will add to the town’s prosperity.  Other buildings in the town include three places of worship, two stores, two blacksmiths, three carpenters, two public houses and three butchers’ shops.

The District Council is presently cutting through Cox’s Hill, which will be a great help to all loading passing through Mintaro this winter.
