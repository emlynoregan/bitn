Burra Races, 17 January.  This was a successful meeting in ideal weather.

The improvements at the course this year included a windmill and tank – a good well having been recently sunk and pipes laid to convey water to the course.  Covered stalls have been supplied at the saddling paddock and an exercise ring laid out.  We understand the grandstand is to be enlarged.  The main race, The Burra Handicap, carried a purse of 100 sovereigns and was won by H.E. Press’s Flagfall ridden by Andrews.
