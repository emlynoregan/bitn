Kooringa Bible Christian Chapel will be 150 years old on 5 December.  The congregation for this chapel formed largely as the result of the work of James Blatchford, a Cornish miner and lay preacher who arrived in the colony in 1847.  He and three other lay preachers, John Halse, and brothers John & Thomas Pellew had a passion to gather together members belonging to the Bible Christian Church in Cornwall to be a witness in their new home.  They formed the first Bible Christian congregation outside of Cornwall.  This group of about 49 members applied to the SA Mining Association in 1849 for some land and received a piece on the southwest corner of Paxton Square, where it began to erect a new chapel.  It was completed in March 1850 and James Blatchford preached the first sermon.  In April 1850 Revs James Way and James Rowe arrived to lead the church through a period of rapid growth.  Very soon they outgrew the chapel and built another south along Bridge Terrace.  The original chapel was the first of some 500 Bible Christian Chapels across Australia.  In 1900 the Bible Christians united with the Primitive Methodists and the Wesleyans to form the Methodist Church.  This in turn became part of the Uniting Church in Australia in 1977.
