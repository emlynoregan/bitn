Samuel Baker writes, concerned about the alarming and indiscriminate use of air rifles within the town.  On Monday morning a bullet passes between four people talking in his back yard.  It was little short of a miracle that no one was hit.

The editor agrees that action is needed and reports a young lad recently shot a hole in his sisterâ€™s hat while firing at sparrows.
