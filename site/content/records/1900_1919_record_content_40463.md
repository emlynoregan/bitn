Obituary & Inquest.  John Hammer, aged 70, died as the result of a motor accident on 16 January.  E.W. Crewes was coroner on 17 January.

J.W. Aldridge, farmer of Booborowie:

Was riding in the car with Dr Sangster going to Aberdeen from the races.  About 100 yards from the bend we met a vehicle whose horse shied across into our path.  Dr Sangster steered hard left.  At the same time a man walking on the left started across from the left hand side to the right hand side which forced the doctor to pull strongly to the right to avoid him.  In doing so a tyre came off which caused the car to swing around and strike the man.  Dr Sangster examined the man, who was bleeding from the ears and mouth, and sent him to the hospital.  Do not know who was driving the trap, but they lost control and got onto the wrong side of the road.

William Bass, labourer of Kooringa, gave evidence confirming Aldridge’s account.  He believed the car to be doing c. 12 m.p.h.

Dr Steele gave evidence that the man had suffered a large skull fracture and haemorrhage of the brain.

Dr Sangster Jun.’s evidence was essentially that of Aldridge.

He said the man died just before the ambulance arrived.  He believed he was doing under 15 m.p.h.  He did not know of any carelessness on the part of the trap driver.

William J. Richards, manager of Murray Aunger Motor Garage had looked at the tyre marks and said they were consistent with the evidence given.  They car had stopped within 15-20 yards.

M-C Queale gave evidence on receiving the body.
