Obituary.  Mr J. Nickles died on 2 May at his residence in Copperhouse aged about 98.  He was born near Truro or St Ives in Cornwall and arrived in SA with his wife c. 63 years ago.  His wife was Mary Ann Harvey, sister of Mrs James Howeth of Yongala.  He worked at the Burra Mine till it closed and then was a builder for a time â€“ at first on the house of John Reed at Wandillah.  Later he went to Paratoo, well sinking and then took to land and carting at Copperhouse.  His first wife died and he remarried in 1880, a widow Mrs Nourse.  Two children of the second marriage survive: Mr J. Nickles of Copperhouse and Mrs W.T. Lomman along with four grandchildren.  He was a staunch supporter of the Methodist Church.  For long he was a trustee and Sunday school superintendent of the Westbury Church.  [John Nickles.  A family history of the related Nourse Family by Irene V. Steen gives the birth year as 1826 and therefore an age at death of 93.  Registration of death says died 2 May 1919 at Copperhouse aged 97.]
