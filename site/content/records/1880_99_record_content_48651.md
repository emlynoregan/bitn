W. West writes a letter accusing W.H. Hardy of unjustifiably condemning the directors of the Burra Mine in the Advertiser.  His statements referring to tribute pitches at the mine are untrue and calculated to convey a false impression.  West says that for several years tribute pitches have been let to all respectable qualified miners who chose to apply – under the most liberal terms.

‘New Aberdeen’ also writes in response to Hardy’s column in the Advertiser on Monday.  He says the company has always behaved honourably as have all its directors.

‘Mr Hardy, however, appears to me to wish to introduce the seeds of dissension and strife even in his remarks re the mine.  I think it would do him good the change the policy he has pursued here for so many years to his infinite disadvantage, and try instead to scatter seeds of kindness and promote peace.’
