Weather.  A thunderstorm on Tuesday afternoon was the fiercest for many years.  Heavy rain and very vivid lightning was accompanied by the continuous roar of thunder.  Many who were outside were thrown to the ground by the concussion of one bolt.  Messrs George Lawn & Rose received the full force of it on Mr McBride’s farm and were considerably dazed.  Another even louder noise and more intense flash occurred as people made their way to the Referendum Meeting.  George March’s cab horses bolted and crashed into trees opposite C.J. Pearce’s shop, damaging the cab and smashing the pole.  In one afternoon shower 88 points fell and in all 1.27” was recorded.  T.J. Hams lost a horse struck by lightning at Ironmine.  Dollard Brothers lost 90 tons of hay burnt by a lightning strike at Leighton.  Another stack at P. Reddin’s Booborowie was also ignited, but saved.  Many smaller fires were started throughout the district.
