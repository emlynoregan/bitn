Bicycle Race, 24 June.  During the race E. Scroop got a puncture and P. McLennan & J. Priess collided smashing McLannan’s front wheel.  R. Rogers ran out of wind.    Priess’s wheel failed three miles from home, so R.G. Hunt was the sole survivor and had an easy win, getting the medal for first and the one for fastest time.  [It had been a handicap event.]  Priess got 2nd and 7/6 and E. Scroop 5/- for 3rd.  This closed the season for this year and it is hoped now to form a cycle club in Burra.
