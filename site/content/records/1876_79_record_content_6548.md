Market Square Well. A meeting was held at the Institute on Tuesday afternoon with Dr Nesbitt in the chair. Mr F.W. Holder explained he had obtained information from Mr Miller of Francis Clark & Sons and a suggestion of an offer to bore in Market Square. It seems clear no water supply from the Govt. is possible without a general rate and therefore local action is a better proposition with the revenue going to the Corporation. The evidence of water in the Mine suggests a well in Market Square would strike water at 200-300'. He proposed that 1/2 the cost be met by the Govt. through the Council with'/4 from SAMA and 1/4 by public subscription. The Corporation must be applied to at the next meeting. Sir Henry Ayers had been written to and private subscriptions of £70 were already promised.

Cost of boring: -	50'	£12-10-0	100' 	£37-10-0

150' 	£75- 0-0	200' 	£125- 0-0

250' 	£187-10-0	300' 	£262-10-0

The discussion generally approved this scheme since the Govt. plan would cost £800 plus the cost of maintaining the pumping engine etc. The bore would be cheaper and would belong to the town. SAMA has since promised £25.
