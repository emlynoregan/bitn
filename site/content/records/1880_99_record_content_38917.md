St Peter’s Cathedral Choir.  There is an article of some 1⅓ columns on their visit to Burra by ‘Inkslinger’. 

The Saturday Concert was unfortunately delayed by the late arrival of the express – an all too frequent occurrence.  The first half had to be altered as a consequence.  The concert is reviewed at length.
