Annual Seaside Trip.  A meeting on Monday night in the Council Chamber was told a special train to Henley Beach or Semaphore would be £76-16-0 and to Brighton £82-16-0.  Heavy traffic on the line would prevent a trip to Semaphore on a Saturday.  It was decided to go to Henley Beach on Saturday 19 February.  Mr Mundy was appointed secretary.  The balance on hand from last year was £17-4-2.  Fares would be 6/- and 2/6 for children.  Copperhouse, Booborowie, World’s End and Leighton Schools would be included.  [Tarlee School had organised a trip for 17 February for all stations between Saddleworth and Hamley Bridge.]
