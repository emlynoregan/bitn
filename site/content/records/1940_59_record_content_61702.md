A new School Council has settled in to help the school.  Thank are particularly due to A.B. Riggs who had been a member of the High School Council for 24 years and President for the last 8.  Mr H. J.B. Jennison succeeds him.  The Secretary, Mr J. Fisher, also deserves many thanks.

The ladies of the Parents & Friends’ Assoc. under Mrs Ellis as President and Mrs Deere as Secretary are also to be thanked for their help in improving many amenities.

The High school Ball was a great success and netted over £89.

[Many other people are thanked.]

Thanks are extended to Mr Burdon & Mr Deer on the teaching staff and to Miss Hallewell.  Mr Walker, who has given excellent service as Woodwork teacher and Miss Inglis in Home Science and Needlework are both moving on.
