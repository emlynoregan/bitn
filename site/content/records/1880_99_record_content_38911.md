Burra Institute.  The want of proper stage accommodation has been a concern for some time.  The committee has had plans prepared for extensive alterations and expects to call tenders shortly.

Mr J. Roach of Adelaide kindly arranged a series of concerts to aid the Institute funds and the first of these took place last Saturday.  There were musical selections, songs, recitations, tableux, [sic] etc.

A childrenâ€™s concert is arranged for next Saturday afternoon followed by an evening concert.
