Cr Jeffery said the Manoora route practically followed the railway line.

It was resolved that at present they could not meet the request without further consideration.

It was resolved to write to the Government seeking a sealed road to Burra as a Centenary project.

The Lord Mayor of Adelaide asked the Mayor to call a public meeting for the purpose of soliciting funds for a memorial to the late King George V.

Cr Dow objected to raising funds for a memorial in Adelaide.

Any action was left up to the Mayor.
