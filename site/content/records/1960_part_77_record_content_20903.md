Obituary.  Mr Arthur James Prior died at the Repatriation General Hospital Springbank, Adelaide 26 June aged 76.  He was born at Burra North on 11 July 1887 of parents who were both born in Burra. His father was the late Elijah Thomas Prior who was born in 1861 and his mother nee Elizabeth Owens was born in 1857 and lived to 93, dying in Adelaide in 1950.  He father was one of the original Burra miners and she was born and lived for some years in the old minersâ€™ dugouts in the banks of the Burra Creek.  Mr Arthur Prior lived for many years in the district and later in Burra itself.  Before WWI he worked on farming and station properties in the Burra, Mt Bryan and Gumbowie districts and was employed for a number of years by the late Mr John Collins of Collinsville.  He enlisted in WWI and served in France with the 48th Battalion.  He was wounded in the Bullecourt Campaign and was taken prisoner by the Germans.  He spent almost two years as a POW and suffered great hardships.  After the war he returned to the Burra district with his brother Gilbert, who had been wounded on the same day and in the same battle in France, but who had been repatriated to Australia some time before him.  He took up farming as a soldier settler in the Springbank area and at Hanson and was successful until selling out just before WWII.  For some years Mr Prior than conducted a confectionery business in Market Square in the premises now occupied by Mr Alan Baulderstone.
