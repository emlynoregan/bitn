Mongolata Goldfield

Tributers on Wildildie claim encountered a healthy looking seam and anticipated a big find further ahead.  They asked permission to go onto the adjoining Baldina Claim and sink a shaft.  Being granted permission they encroached about 20 yards on Baldina and were about 8ft down when they came across a remarkable find on 28 February.  The ore was very rich and there was a find of pure gold.  Up to Thursday 152oz of gold had been taken out and amongst the lot was a nugget of nearly 2 lbs.  The sight of the second police escort from the field in a week had people asking who had ‘struck it’.  The first escort had brought in the gold from the battery.  On Friday a third escort brought in 97oz from the same claim.  It is speculated that the battery will produce 30oz to the ton or more from the find with portions of it up to 100oz per ton.

More men were put on and yesterday 15 tons of ore was going through the battery and this will greatly enhance the value of the find, which is already fully £2,000.  As we go to press another police escort has arrived.  Rumour has it that the find was the largest made in SA and the grand total is on the order of 500oz.

Byles’ Co.  The latest crushing of 154 tons returned 186oz.  Since the battery started in April 1,175 tons have returned 2,201oz.  Cyanide has recovered a further 31oz 8dwt 20gr to total 186oz 13dwt 20gr from 154 tons of ore.  [Sic: but it doesn’t make sense.]
