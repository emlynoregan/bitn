The Season at Booborowie.  There was an exceptionally wet winter.  Now dust and grass seeds are stirred by the lightest of breezes.  Ants, flies and mosquitoes are prevalent.  Rust and haydie are fairly prevalent, but overall the yields should be fairly satisfactory.  Fat stock and plenty of feed is a compensation.  Oat and barley yields are up on expectations.  Summer lucerne will benefit from the wet winter, but fire is a real threat this year.
