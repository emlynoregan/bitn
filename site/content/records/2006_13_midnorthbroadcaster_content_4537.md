Burra Young Citizen of the Year is Chelsea Evans.

Chelsea gained the award in recognition of her involvement with the Burra Community School and the Auburn Players.  She was also a state finalist in the Rostrum Voice of Youth Public Speaking Competition 2005.  She came to live in Burra at the start of her teenage years.  Having recently completed Year 12, she intends to work in Adelaide for a year before going to performing arts school.  She recommends that young people get involved in the local community, not just because it looks good on their résumé, but because it broadens experience and allows you to see more of what is around.
