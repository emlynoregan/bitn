A. d’Vine writes of the danger of laying poison baits in and around towns.  The baits used recently have contained a large dose of strychnine.  It is in crystalline form and will lie around undissolved for months, requiring strong acid to attack it.  An emetic should be administered in attempting to save any dog affected.
