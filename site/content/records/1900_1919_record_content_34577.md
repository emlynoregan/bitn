The main discussion centred on the requirements for depasturing sheep to be shown to allow them to eat anything growing in paddocks including lucerne etc. [and not just native grasses] as long as they cut their own feed with their teeth and be neither rugged nor housed.  The changes were necessitated said Mr Crowder because of changed management practices now.  Most breeders were now growing lucerne.  The changes to be effective with the 1914 show.  [A later amendment brought the new rules in for the 1913 show because, in Mr Hawke’s word: ‘as the song said, “Everybody was doing it”’.
