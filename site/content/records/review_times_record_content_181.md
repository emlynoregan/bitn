Bikies.  Several reports of troubles caused by bikies were received over the weekend, but Mr Dick Ludlow of the Kooringa Hotel said about 30 of the ‘Reapers’ had arrived at the hotel on Thursday night and he had had no trouble and he thought that during their stay at Redbanks they had probably been better behaved than some locals.
