Burra Benevolent Society AGM 25 June.  Parcels of clothing were received from various donors.  Firewood continues to be distributed to the old folks.  Clothing will for the time being, be handed to the Local Unemployment Aid Committee for distribution, to avoid overlapping.  When this committee ceases to exist the Benevolent Society will go on as before.
