Salvation Army.  The change of officers took place this month.  Capt. Gibbons & Capt. Rosser were ordered to Moonta Mines.  Both ladies had been popular here.  While in Adelaide en route Capt. Gibbons had to have an operation for appendicitis.  Their places have been taken by Capt. R.S. Thomson and his wife, who were welcomed to the Hall on 11 January.  Rev. V. Secombe attended with Mr Jackson, who is filling the vacancy caused by the death of Rev. J.A. Andrews at Redruth.
