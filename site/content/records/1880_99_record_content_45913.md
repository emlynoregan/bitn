[Note the mistake in numbering: the sequence went from 1099 to 200.  Apparently the 0 in 1099 was overlooked.  If subsequently noticed it was not corrected, but on the microfilm version there is a handwritten 1 in front of the number to make it 1200.  This handwritten change continued to 1207 and then ceased.]
