The Burra School Board met on Thursday.  The Inspector-General wished to know if parents at Stony Gap would undertake to provide board for a teacher as unless this were done the small attendance would make the salary too small for any teacher.  Enquiries will be made.  The Minister of Education requires a formal letter in reference to the wants of Copperhouse.  It will be sent.
