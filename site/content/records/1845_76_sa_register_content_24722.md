Ulooloo Diggings.  The new rush to Cousins’ Gully, five miles north of Coglin’s Gully has proved successful so far.  Several diggers are getting 1 dwt per bucket.  18 windlasses are in operation with sinking to 20 ft.  Gold has also been got in several places between Coglin’s Gully and the new rush.
