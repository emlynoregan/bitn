Burra Town Council, 2 June

The Fire brigade’s Board advises the probable expenditure for the coming year was £413, of which the Council had to contribute 25%.

Highways Department acknowledged receipt of Council’s request to erect a new bridge near the Bon Accord Hotel.  It said that owing to the sub-standard nature of the original structure, the present bridge could not be repaired.  They would give attention to a new bridge when materials became available.

A warning sign will be placed on the approach to the bridge.

Victoria Park Improvement Committee acknowledged the receipt of the Council’s permission to improve Victoria Park, but said the Council had not indicated whether the committee could use the £400 presently in Council’s possession to be used on public works and asking that a ratepayers’ meeting be called to discuss same.  The Mayor granted a meeting to be held on 14 July.

The regular raatepayers’ meeting would be held on 30 June.
