Burra Cheer-up Society.

The Ladies’ Band and others met Sgt Hugh Whitford at the station when he returned to Burra on Thursday.  He was severely wounded some time ago.  Though not a Burra boy, he was well known here, as he worked in Elder, Smith’s office.

This was the first appearance of the Band at the station to welcome a returning soldier.  He was also given a welcome social on Friday evening.

A social was given to Cpl P. Tuit, who was visiting Mrs C.J. Pearce and who was a friend of Ptes Andrew Pearce and Herb. Riggs.

Gifts were recently sent to Ptes H. Sealey, Pratt & Schultz, who were unable to attend a social.
