Sparks

Rain killed mice aggregating 160lbs at Koolunga last week.

A pleasant social was held in George Sampson’s Hall in Thames St and saw dancing to the wee hours on Friday night.  [The former Primitive Methodist Sunday School.]

Mrs F.A.S. Field has purchased the trucks from the Smelts in anticipation of the development of the phosphate claims east of Burra.
