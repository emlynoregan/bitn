Christmas in Burra

Christmas Eve was busy and trading was equal to previous years, though the numbers around were less, no doubt due to the cold conditions.  Father Christmas arrived on schedule.  The merry-go-round did not operate in the afternoon due to rain.  The Rural Youth Dance did well and raised Â£26 for Rally Funds this year.
