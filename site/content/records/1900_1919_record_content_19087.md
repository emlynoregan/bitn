Court.

James Sampson Pryor, ‘the alleged manager of the Burra Mine’ was charged with unlawfully beating Frank Anthony Meyer West on 13 December 1906.  The boy gave evidence that with other boys he had been sliding down a slate roof on the mine when Mr Pryor came along and chased him.  He caught him in the coach shed and struck him with a stick several times, which broke.  Roy Hammer, a somewhat older lad, gave evidence corroborating the above.  John Smith also gave evidence and all agreed that the defendant had struck the boy, Frank, and had said ‘I’ll cut the blood out of you, you young scamp.’  (Or similar words.)

Mrs W. West, wife of W. West Sen. Gave evidence that on another occasion Pryor had threatened the boy, saying ‘I will cut his liver out.’

Pryor was unrepresented.  He said he saw three little boys sliding up and down an old slate roof.

[The editor thought they were clever to slide up!]

He believed they were in danger on the old roof.  He claimed he went after Frank to prevent an accident and with great emphasis said: ‘Hi ham the manager of the Mine.’

He rushed up and gave his own little boy one stroke and sent him to his mother crying.

The court fined the defendant £1 reduced to 10/- + costs: in all amounting to £2-11-0.
