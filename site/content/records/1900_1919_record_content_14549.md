Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co.  Captain Hancock and staff inspected the mine on Wednesday and will report to the directors at Moonta.  The staff left yesterday after taking levels and samples.  We venture to say his report will be favourable and the only problem will be the financial position.
