Gary Donaldson & his wife Jan set up Cousin Jack’s Art & Craft Gallery after touring SA looking for a suitable site about 15 months ago.  Gary is a wood turner whose pieces are a pleasant blend of the functional and the interpretive.  The gallery also has works by Peter Anderson, Rita Hall, Alison Cooper, Margaret Warwick and Martin Corbin among others.  [Photo of Gary Donaldson.]
