Kooringa News, 28 September

The Burra Institute held its annual meeting on Friday last.  J. Burnell took the chair.

The secretary, Mr J. Lee reported a decline in membership, which he ascribed to the departure of people to Wallaroo and elsewhere, the depressed state of trade generally, the want of new books and the cessation of the lecture series during the winter months.  It is expected that a large consignment of book will arrive from England in the next three months.  The Governors of the SA Institute recently offered to pay half the travelling expenses of some very talented lecturers and as a result the committee has planned eight and possibly twelve lectures for the coming year.  In the last year eight lectures were given and six of them were gratuitously presented.  The committee regrets that it has been necessary to expend another large sum in alterations and additions to the Institute.  However, the extra windows in the reading room and the erection of a closet are expenses that will not recur, at least for some years.  There will be some expense in the coming year because the building is not in as good a condition as they would like it to be.  Income for the year:

Telegraph Office rental	£16-10-0

E. & A. Copper Co. donation 	£10-10-0

Government Grant 	£37-8-0

Proceeds from lectures	£17-13-6

Subscriptions	£49-9-0

SAMA donation	£10-0-0

Catalogues disposed of	£1-2-0

Total	£142-2-2

[Approximately!]

The expenditure has totalled £185-11-5, of which the additions and alterations accounted for £37.

There are 803 books in the library.

Elected for the coming year’s committee were: Messrs Roach, Corey, Dennis, Hoskins and Burnell.  J. Lee continues as Secretary.

It was resolved that a debating society be formed.
