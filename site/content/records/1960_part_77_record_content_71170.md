Obituary.  Allan Donald Sellars died 12 March. He has been described as ‘a friend to all who had the pleasure of knowing him’.  He was born at Burra North in 1908 and educated at the Burra School.  He married Daphne Hirschausen in 1927 and together they commenced and operated a general carrying, grain agency and wood merchant’s business.  From the mid 1930s Mr Sellars conducted a mail run for six years, travelling each weekend to the outlying stations east of Burra, covering a distance of 300 miles over unmade roads, with some 180 rates to negotiate.  Declared unfit for war service, he opened a service station and garage in conjunction with his other business to release the owner for war service.  On medical advice he gave up his business and purchased ‘Emu Flat’ at Keith in 1945.  This proved unsuitable for family needs at the time and he then spent six years on dairy farms at Murray Bridge and Jervois before returning to Keith in 1953.  In 1958 he founded the General Agency business of A.D. Sellars & Sons – later including all six sons in premises at Keith.  Ill health forced him into semi-retirement in 1966.  He was always interested in the community and was the founder of the ‘Burdett’ Agricultural Bureau at Murray Bridge.  He was a director of the Jervois Co-op Milk Factory and assisted in getting it included in the city milk area, thereby receiving extra bonuses.  He was on the committees of the Keith Agricultural Bureau, Keith War Memorial Community Centre and the Keith & District Show Society.  He was of a cheerful disposition and ever ready to help his fellowman.  He is survived by his daughter, Roma Mrs C.A. Davis and sons, Colin, Brian, Graham, Dean, Ian and Kevin.
