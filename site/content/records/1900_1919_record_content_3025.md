Redruth Court.  The Arson Case.

Evidence was given of the discovery of the damage in the morning.

E.W. Crewes said he had seen on the evening of 5 March at about 11.20 p.m. the ‘woman known as Mrs Byrne . . . standing at Luke Day’s corner.’

Then came much evidence from various witnesses about the kerosene and matches and the failure of the fire to take hold.

M-C Phelan later visited C. Grow and found that the cushions in his cab had been saturated with kerosene.  Also from the cab he got an empty bottle that had held kerosene.  Fresh footprints from the cab were covered up by M-C Phelan and in the evening in company with M-C Jemison, Thomas Byrne was found to have kerosene on his coat.  When asked to provide the shoes he had worn on Tuesday night Byrne claimed to have thrown them away as they were hurting him.  Byrne was then arrested.

Annie Morrison, who lived with the Byrnes, said Byrne had come home about 11.30 on Tuesday and then had coat and boots and no kerosene on the coat.  They went to their separate beds and she did not hear him go out again, but thought she heard him come in later – did not get up.  In the morning she smelt kerosene on his clothing, but received no answer to he question about the kerosene on the clothes.

When M-C Jemison asked about it he said it had been thrown by a silly fellow: Tommy Tighe.

Thomas Tighe, of Pulsford Rd, Prospect, Adelaide, said he had been in Burra, but left on the Wednesday.  On Tuesday Byrne had wanted him to do a sword dance, but he would not.  Byrne said get some kerosene to burn down a shop in Kooringa, but he would not.  He did not throw any kerosene over Byrne.

Eliz. Jemison gave evidence that Tighe spent the night in question in the police station at Kooringa in the cell – was asleep at 10 p.m. with no kerosene on his clothes.

Thomas Halls confirmed the pair’s movements earlier in the day and generally Tighe’s evidence.

Benjamin J. Bourman, ostler at the Commercial Hotel gave evidence suggesting that the kerosene was probably taken from the hotel’s lamp room.  The supply there running out four days before it should have.

Blacktracker Tommy King gave evidence of the tracks and where they led.
