Mr & Mrs W.H. Quinn are visiting Burra from Tusmore.  Mr Quinn, who is 77, and was born in Burra, says he can remember watching a blackfellowâ€™s corroboree in Market Square in his very young days.  [Since he must be remembering an event of c. 1867 at the earliest this is surprising as there are no other references to Aborigines in the town in such numbers as this implies, after the 1850s as far as I can recall.  Worth further investigation.]
