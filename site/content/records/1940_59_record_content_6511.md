Gunner Ted Riggs was given a social last Thursday evening at Burra Institute.  It was a clear, but very cold night, though that was no excuse for the recent falling off in attendance for such occasions.  Ted is the second of three sons of Mr & Mrs J. Arthur Riggs to enlist.  In commending the Riggs Family’s commitment to the war effort, the Mayor also referred to the record of the Brown Family of Burra North.  Mrs Brown had five sons who served in the Great War and now a younger son and several grandsons were serving in the current war.  One of the grandsons* had recently become the first Burra boy to gain a Military Medal in the present conflict.  He also referred to Pte Claude Attrill, who has been listed among the ‘missing’ for some weeks now.  Sgt Lindsay Thomas had sent bright letters home.  The usual presentations were made and the Mayor fastened the wristlet watch on Ted’s arm.

[Details of the social extend for some 1½ columns.]

[*62, 29, 22 July 1941, page 1, corrects this report.  Pte Dunning of Pt Pirie has been awarded the Military Medal.  He is a nephew of Mrs Brown and not a grandson as cited above.  A Burra boy is thus yet to win this coveted honour in the present war.]
