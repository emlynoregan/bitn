‘As to the garbled statements appearing in several newspapers concerning the recent poisoning cases at the Reformatory . . . we would point out that the statements came from a source that would not stand denial.  We can assure the writer that the public are much concerned about the management though they refrain from rushing into print.  We have received several letters upholding us in our comments, and were they published there would be even a greater demand for hair dye than at present; in fact the management would bid a quick retreat, the girls would be liberated and the building would collapse.’
