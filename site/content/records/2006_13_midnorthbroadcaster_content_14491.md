CFS long service awards were presented in Burra on Sunday at the new CFS/SES Shed on Smelts Road.  24 recipients received service medals.  The medals were for periods of service ranging from 10 to 50 years.  There was a barbecue luncheon and Dan van Holst Pellekaan MP performed the official opening of the building, an extension of the former Burra CFS Fire Station.  It now becomes the Burra CFS & SES Complex.
