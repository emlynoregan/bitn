This information, read with Treloar’s booklet of four years previously, he says, gives a ‘fairly truthful story of the Burra Burra Mine whose early discovery and working was a wonderful help to the State by giving it wealth (badly wanted at the time) and providing employment freely, not only on the mine, but also circulated it everywhere besides it being a great incentive to land settlement.’
