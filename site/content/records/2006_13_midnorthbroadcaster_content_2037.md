Jack Coffey, local veterinarian, has worked with engineers to design a device to replace mulesing.  The aim was to achieve what happens with elasticator rings, but mulesing requires a longitudinal section of skin to wither and fall off.  He has devised a clip that will remove similar areas of skin as are removed in a mulesing operation on either side of the breech and tail.  It has worked very well on trials, with very little discomfort and no wound infection.  The innovation is now ready to go commercial and should be available sometime in 2007.
