Burra Cheer-up Society.

When the first volunteers left they were accorded an enthusiastic send-off and public recognition. Since then the return of volunteers on their final leaves has been in ones and twos and this, together with the frequency of it, has meant no public recognition for most.  It was decided a Cheer-up Society would provide a permanent group to take action whenever and as often as necessary.  Mr Frank Harris and Miss Trix Pearce convened a meeting for this end last Saturday in the Lodge Room and 26 ladies and 10 gentlemen attended. [They are named.] The Mayor took the chair.

The Adelaide Cheer-up Society was there to be emulated.  Mrs Seager, founder of the Adelaide Society, suggested a kind of club where the boys would be at home, and that entertainments be arranged.
