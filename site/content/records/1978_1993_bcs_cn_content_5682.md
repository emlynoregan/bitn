Farrell Flat Rural School began 1982 with 30 students on the roll and no staff changes.  The new classroom has arrived, but much work is to be done before Years 1, 2 & 3 can move in.

Dani Fidock & Anne Field will receive their Teaching Diplomas in a ceremony on Saturday at Elder Hall.  [Corrected in the following issue to Bonython Hall.]
