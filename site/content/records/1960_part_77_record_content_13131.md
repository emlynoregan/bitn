  Fortunately we have a plentiful supply of cheap clear water, which needs to be changed more frequently in the hot weather, but this will push up costs as we exceed our water allowance and the filtration plant is needed, especially if Burraâ€™s water supply should change to Murray water.  Thanks are due to Mr Bill Broad as caretaker, following the resignation of Dave Tanswell.  Mr Allan Ireland has had to resign as Secretary on being transferred to Jamestown.
