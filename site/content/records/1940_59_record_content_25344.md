‘Dog Lover’ writes drawing attention to the laying of poison baits for dogs around Paxton Square in Christmas time 1944-45 and again in October 1945.  All pet dogs were ruthlessly poisoned and in lambing time registered dogs were killed with strychnine.  The writer holds the Council responsible and if no action is taken to stamp out this curse ‘the dog owners are going to strike back at the sheep owned by these people who apparently think they can do what they like.’
