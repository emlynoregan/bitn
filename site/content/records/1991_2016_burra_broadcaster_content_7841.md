Burra Art Gallery

The exhibition of works by Marie and Allyson Parsons proved a popular pre-opening event, with attendances totalling 2,000.  Many expressed their satisfaction with the refurbished southern gallery.  The Council-commissioned painting was highly commended.

A further grant application has now been made for funds for Stage II of the gallery development.  A pre-opening exhibition of quilts by Sarah Crowest will be on show from 23 September to the 7 October.

Burra Traders Association will again organise Christmas activities in Market Square on 22 December.
