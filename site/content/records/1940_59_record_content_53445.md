Dingoes are reported as having been seen in the district by S.W. Schmidt of Robertstown – in the vicinity of Bundey Station.  He saw one and heard of another being seen there.  His description certainly matches that of a dingo.  How did a dingo get so far south, past vermin-proof fencing?  Floods last year certainly damaged the fence in places in Queensland and we have heard of dingo troubles in the northwest of NSW, but that is still some 400 miles from Mr Schmidt’s sighting.
