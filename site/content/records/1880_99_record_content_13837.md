Capt. William Bonell of the Salvation Army v. Young for disturbing an open-air service on the evening of 21 June.

Bonell said the meeting was on land at the back of Mr Hicks’ house in Kooringa.  As the Army was singing The Salvation Army is Marching Along the defendant and other young men sang The Salvation Army has all gone wrong.

He asked the young man if he was called ‘Young’ and he said yes.  Thought he was the leader of the group.

Mr Akhurst said the by-law imposed a fine, but the Criminal Law Consolidation Act in Clause 320 imposed only a prison sentence.  The by-law could not over-ride statute law and was therefore invalid.  The court concurred.  The Court declined to allow costs and warned the young men involved that if a charge were laid and proved under the Criminal Law imprisonment was the only mode of dealing with it.
