Court.

Sappho Halls was charged that on 31 March he wilfully and wantonly disturbed Norah McNamara by tapping on her window about 11 p.m.  [The evidence suggests he was playing some sort of game by pretending to have found someone else doing the tapping, but he was seen by Mrs McNamara.]

He pleaded guilty and was fined Â£1 + 10/- costs or 14 days.  The fine was paid.
