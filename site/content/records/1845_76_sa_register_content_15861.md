Kooringa News, 27 August

The measles epidemic has persisted and few families have escaped being infected.  The fearful mortality has continued.  Infants have been most severely affected.

From winter the weather has suddenly become summery.  On Sunday and Monday last we had hot wind and dust, but for the sake of the young pasture these conditions did not persist for very long.

The road from Kooringa to Redruth has been repaired and made passable.  This has not been accomplished not by the Road Board or even the Mining Company, but by the cab driver Mr C. Williams and a number of others who made subscriptions towards the cost.
