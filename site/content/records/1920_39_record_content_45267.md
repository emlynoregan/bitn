“Annual Elections”

Actually a report of a political meeting in the Institute on 9 March at which LCL candidates for the State Elections presented their views.  The Mayor introduced Messrs G.F. Jenkins, A.J. Melrose & A.D. McDonald.  The report runs over 3 columns.  [The heading is presumably a reference to the frequency of changing Premiers in 1933 with Lionel Hill leaving office 13 February and now R.S. Richards facing an election he was destined to lose, giving way to R.L. Butler on 18 April.]
