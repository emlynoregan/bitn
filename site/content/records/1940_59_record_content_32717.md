Burra Burra Show Inc.

Some members have felt for a while now that the show would be better off at the racecourse.  The present grounds are rocky and spectators find walking around them tiring.  Pig and sheep pens have accessibility problems and the ring is too small to allow trotting events.  It would be a costly move only partly offset by the sale of the present site.  One member has promised £100 of 19 others will match it.  When the Show was held at the racecourse in 1923 prize money was £700.  Today the society can only offer £300.  The question was referred to a general committee meeting in the Eastern Telephone building on Friday with a recommendation it be investigated by a special committee.  This recommendation was followed and the investigating committee will meet on 29 August.
