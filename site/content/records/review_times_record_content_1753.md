Burra Uniting Church has called a special meeting to consider the construction of a new manse.  Maintenance of the existing 70-year-old manse was becoming uneconomic.  A special meeting on 20 February will have to approve the purchase of a site selected and the construction of a new manse.  The induction of the new minister is planned for 12 February and the Annual Harvest Festival is scheduled for 26 February.  The new minister is Brian Polkinghorne, who has spent the past seven years in Tanzania [though the paper says Tanziner] working for the World Council of Churches.  He is married with three children and succeeds Rev. A.A. Beames, who retired on 31 December due to ill health.
