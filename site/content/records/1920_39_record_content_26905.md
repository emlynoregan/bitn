CWA, AGM in Liberal Room 11 May chaired by President Mrs I.J. Warnes.

The Hon. Sec. Mrs M. Collins read the report and Mrs P.J. Pickering as Treasurer reported a balance of £7.

Mrs Warnes expounded on the objectives of the CWA for the benefits of some new members.  The CWA was rapidly spreading from state to state.  It had long been well established in Queensland.  Mr & Mrs Wilkinson were thanked for the use of the room at the rear of their stationery business.

All officials were re-elected [as above plus Vice-Presidents Mrs E. Jettner & Mrs J. Tennant.]

The word ‘service’ was dropped from the title which now becomes the Burra Country Women’s Association.

Mrs Warnes has been approached to form an Association in Adelaide.  Apart from other benefits it would give members a room in Adelaide.  She suggested the new Governor’s wife, Lady Hore Ruthven be asked to be President.  A city branch would be a great help for country women visiting Adelaide for reasons of sickness.  Mrs J.E. Hogan said Spalding ladies were interested in the movement.  The rest room at the rear of Mr Wilkinson’s will now be continued at a rental of 10/- a week.
