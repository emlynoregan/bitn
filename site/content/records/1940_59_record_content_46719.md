Burra CWA held its AGM on 21 July.

President Mrs A. Tennant took the chair.  Meetings have not been particularly well attended this year with and average of just over 20 from a membership of over 70.  Catering for the two race meetings in October 1949 and April 1950 was the main source of income.  A barouche was donated to Burra Hospital and £30 sent to Headquarters.  £30 was sent to the Burra Town Hall to help pay for painting the stage, which is used as a supper room.

Wales was the country chosen for International Day this year and Mrs Scott delivered the address and at the meeting Mrs I.J. Warnes pinned a Life Membership badge on Miss Rogers, who is a foundation member of the Burra Branch.

Elected: President, Mrs Tennant; Vice-Presidents, Mesdames Reg. Warnes & Mrs J. Barker; Secretary, Mrs H. Jennison; Treasurer, Miss Rogers & Acting Treasurer, Mrs R.H. Campbell.
