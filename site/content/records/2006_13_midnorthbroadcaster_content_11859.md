Burra Creek Reserve

Work has begun on the upgrading of Burra Creek Reserve.  Trees have been trimmed and a large number of native trees have been planted along the creek.  Edge treatment of the water area has been completed using large blocks from a local quarry.  A larger area has been terraced for car parking opposite Paxton Square Cottages. And this area will ultimately be kerbed, sealed and lined.  Top soil is being spread in the adjacent area and mature trees will be planted.  The walking track will be realigned and in the cooler months grasses and some areas of lawn will be developed to add to the picnic type atmosphere.  Seats, bins and barbecues will be installed.  The area just south of the Caravan Park will then be upgraded.
