Burra Hospital

The Chief Secretary Hon. A.L. McEwin, Dr Rollison (Director of Medical services) and Mr Scantlebury (Secretary of the Hospitals Department) inspected the Burra Hospital thoroughly on Tuesday last week.  They then conferred with members of the Board of Management and Mr G.S. Hawker the MP for the District and Doctors Heddle & Mellor.

Government policy was against issuing a building permit when facilities for which the building was to be used were already in existence.  High priority would be given to additions and renovations.

Eventually a scheme was evolved by which the Burra Hospital Isolation Block would be enlarged to accommodate all the nursing staff and the old portion of the Hospital would be either renovated or demolished.  The Board will now confer with an architect.

A Ratepayersâ€™ Meeting will be held in Burra Town Hall on Wednesday this week.  Interest has been aroused by three pairs of candidates contesting three seats in the Town Council which have fallen vacant.
