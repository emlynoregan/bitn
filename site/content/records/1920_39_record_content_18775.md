‘Returned Soldier’ also writes on the question of the guns.  He says that Mr Collins accuses him of attacking from behind a smoke screen.  He considers this reply ‘very much in the way of a gas attack’.  By becoming Mayor over three years ago Mr Collins automatically became Chairman of the Memorial Committee.  He asks whether it is not true that a prominent citizen of Burra had asked Mr Collins on several occasions to call a meeting of the Committee and it had not been done.  If it is not Mr Collins’ burden he would like to know whose it is.  He congratulates Collins for urging Dr Steele to call a meeting of the RSA, the result of which was as the writer predicted.  He says Collins ridiculed him for saying the guns would be out of sight in the new position, but he maintains that not 5% of visitors would see them in that position.  He regards the latter part of Mr Collins’ letter as too ridiculous to comment upon.
