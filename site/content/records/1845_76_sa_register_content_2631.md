John James writes from Leigh Street, Adelaide 13 September 1848.

[In a long letter James says he has just retuned from the Burra Burra Mine and has been mightily impressed.  In the first half of the piece he gets ridiculously carried away, speculating that if managed properly the mine will be the richest in the world and last for centuries, ‘nay, possibly as long as the sun and the moon shall endure’.  The second half is of more interest, as there he makes two suggestions concerning the good management of the mine:]

Would it not be better, he asks, ‘to commence carrying off the whole of the surface under which their ores are, until they get to the mineral deposits; by pursuing this mode they could save all their ores, and also the cast outlay of capital in timber for keeping open the ground below, and also convert the vast quantity of timber at present in the levels into cash.

The proprietors would act judiciously in looking ahead, and cause a given number of men to be employed in making discoveries within the limits of the set whilst the mine is rich, because the outlay would not be felt; and supposing new lodes should be found rich in minerals, the quantity they could raise would be increased, and shares would probably in a short time double, and possibly quadruple their present value.’
