Kooringa Methodist Sunday School held a Christmas Party, which replaced the picnic that had been cancelled due to the measles epidemic.  It was held in the hall on 13 December.

Burra Rifle Club fired the 10th stage of the Fearon Trophy with best scores from J. Harris and J.A. Riggs.

Burra Benevolent Society had Â£6 to distribute for Christmas Cheer and now goes into recess till the third Thursday in March.

Church of England Day School held its break-up last Friday evening.  A display of work and a program of items were presented.  Miss H. Sinclair headmistress reported a successful year, though the small numbers means a lack of competition in most grades.  The school joined in the Sunday school picnic.  Inspector E.C. Loan found the school satisfactory with some weaknesses in History and oral Arithmetic.  The Rector thanked Dr Steele for acting as chairman from the departure of Rev. Coles until his arrival and thanked Mr Bednall for carrying out secretarial duties.  The prize list is printed.  Top of the honour roll was David Steele.
