Rain is still needed.  The recent fall has paradoxically been killing sheep.  Many with heavy wool are too weak to carry the load of a wet coat and consequently fall over and die by degrees.  On Sunday a nice soaking rain delivered 0.41” and the wind blew a hurricane on Monday with more rain on Tuesday.  In all 1.1” was recorded in Burra.
