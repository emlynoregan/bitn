Burra Town Council, 6 March

A letter from the Burra hospital Board says the Board did not desire to publish an official report, but the Council’s representative could report if he so wished.

Elder, Smith & Goldsbrough, Mort reply that they are not prepared to assist financially in repairing the road from the saleyards to the main road.

Cr Lott urged action perhaps in conjunction with the Peterborough Council to try to get the Morgan-Whyalla pipeline through Burra.

The Mayor wanted a public meeting first, as he did not want to see people paying for water passing through their properties if they did not want it, but as yet they had nothing to put to such a meeting.

The Town Clerk said the Commissioner’s party was out taking evidence and would soon be in Burra.

It was resolved that the Mayor and Town Clerk would interview the Engineer-in-Chief Mr H. Angwin and his party when they visit Burra.

Cr Lott again complained of the dusty state of the Cemetery Road.

Cr Terry said Thames St was in a far worse condition.

He also asked if the Council had any information on the swimming pool, as he was on the committee, but had never been notified of a meeting.

Cr Jeffery said he had heard nothing since specifications came.

The Mayor knew nothing in the last 12 months.
