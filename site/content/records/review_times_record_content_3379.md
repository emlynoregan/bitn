Heritage Town Project to Open in October

Morphett’s Pumphouse, the Bon accord Mine Museum and the Kingston Street row of Paxton’s Square Cottages, which together make up The Burra Heritage Town Jubilee 150 Project, will open on 5 October.

The opening will be performed by the Minister for Mines & Energy Mr Payne.  He will be accompanied by the Chairman of the Jubilee 150 Committee, Mr K. Bonython, the Chairman of the DC Cr J. McMahon and the Chairman of the steering committee Mr J. Hawker, on a tour of the three centres before the opening.  Burra National Trust President Mrs M. Wright said invitations were posted this week and work was in its final stages.  She said that Morphett’s Pumphouse looked stunning and was really the most striking of the projects.  The stonework on the exterior has been re-pointed, the shaft in front of the building has been re-timbered and the old work tunnel leading to the shaft was being restored.  This had been made possible by $5,000 from the $68,000 grant announced last week.  The remainder of the money will be used for drainage, roads and landscaping of the site.  The interior of the building had been refitted with timber landings.  These have appropriate circular and rectangular spaces where the cylinder and mechanical gear would have been when the pump was operating in the 1800s.  An outdoor platform leads out from the opening where the engine boom projected.  This will serve as an observation area of the mine, especially the open cut and Morphett’s Shaft, which is directly below.  When finished the building will have interpretive signs on each landing.  The final cost of the Morphett Pumphouse project will be in the order of $115,000; paid for by Jubilee 150 grants.

The social history museum at the Bon Accord Mine site is also nearing completion.  Pam Marlow, the model maker, will devote the first week of the school holidays to completing the model.  The National Trust had received a $3,200 grant from the History Trust of SA to illuminate the old Bon Accord Shaft and work on the special lighting effects will begin this weekend.  Interpretive signs and graphics were currently being prepared in Adelaide and consultant designer Peter Stitt will return soon to assist with their placement.  He had also been employed under a History Trust grant.

The Kingston street row of Paxton Cottages is now complete.  This includes the new manager’s residence and the Bible Christian Chapel.  Mrs Wright understood interpretive signs would be erected there when it became functional as the booking office.  The official opening of the three projects will take place at Morphett’s Pumphouse after the inspection tour by the official party.  Members of the community were encouraged to attend the opening, in period costume if possible, and to inspect each site after the official opening.
