Court.

A woman named Ellen Gay was clearly thought by M-C Jemison to be a prostitute.  She was charged with having no visible legal means of support, but failed to appear.  Jemison applied for a warrant, but the evidence was so flimsy that the Bench evidently thought the application frivolous and refused to grant it.  Doubtless Jemison will try again in another form.
