Burra Showgrounds.  New provisions are to be made for sheep at the showgrounds.  There will be a 30 ft wide shed, with a ramp and race at either end for loading and unloading.  The yards will comprise 96 pens each 4 ft x 5 ft in three double rows.  The whole will be erected from the materials from the wood and iron fence on the south side of the grounds, which is to be removed.  The fence will be replaced by pig netting (cyclone) topped with two barbed wires.  The location to the west will be sheltered from wind and rain by the railway embankment.  The horses-in-action ring will be extended 15 ft on the western side.  The farming community will be asked to donate machinery and labour to lessen the cost.  Membersâ€™ cars will be allowed to park closer to the ring and for a further distance around it.
