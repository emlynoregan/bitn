The Old Baptist Church.  Having long been forsaken and falling into ruin, it was purchased some time ago by the Council for use as a depot for the sum of £60-£70.  Recently the walls and roof almost fell in and consequently the Council has demolished part of it and repaired the rest.  Mr John Harvey, the dayman, has done the mason work and C.A. Lott has almost completed re-roofing it.  So far £30 has been saved by storing weights and measures there and if it were used as a Council Chamber the £20 p.a. rent of the Institute would be saved and the building would pay for itself in three years.
