Characteristics of the 1964 paper.

The paper had a standard size of 8 pages of 7 columns, with occasional supplements, but more usually extra material was accommodated by expanding the paper to 10 or even 12 pages.  These expanded issues often had very confusing numbering of the pages.

Most news was carried on page 1 with sport a big part of subsequent pages.  Another feature of other pages was the printing of reports from district towns â€“ Spalding, Farrell Flat and Booborowie in particular, but sometimes from Riverton and Saddleworth.  Spalding was more regularly represented than others.
