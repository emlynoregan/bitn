Princess Royal Mines.  Several miners from these mines made a visit to town last week.  Some intended to return with their wives and others with household goods that might attract fair acquaintances to share with them the pleasures of a bush life.  The village at Princess Royal is well situated and abundantly supplied with water.  Operations are proceeding vigorously upon a large lode of rich ore at a depth of about twelve fathoms.  The general prospects of the mine are encouraging for the proprietors.

At the Burra Burra Mines some of the men contracted to raise a quantity of prime ore at 15/- per ton are likely to realise handsome earnings.
