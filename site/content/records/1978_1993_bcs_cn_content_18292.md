Burra national Trust Branch.  From President Maureen Wright’s Annual Report:

The bicentennial year was a busy one.

Rescue archaeology was carried out at the old White Hart Hotel and the Bushman’s Home hotel.

Fundraising was organised for the purchase of the Burra Record printing equipment.

A submission was made re the proposed new motel for Burra.

Representatives were placed on committees such as the Burra Tourist Office, Burra Town Hall and Lewis Board of Management.

In April Shirley Thamm organised a display at the Burra Courthouse for heritage Week.

Burra Courthouse – now in our care – has been the venue for monthly meetings.

The $50,000 Redruth Gaol Commonwealth Bank Bicentennial Project was completed and opened by the Governor.

Together with the Burra Mine Museum Committee the Key Hire system was upgraded and a new Passport System introduced from which the National Trust gets 45%, the Burra Mine Museum gets 30% and the Tourist Association gets 25%.  Passports cost $10 per car.

Several items have been given to the Mine Museum Committee for display at the Burra Mine Site, including the SAMA Bell, the balance weight box and a winding engine crank.

David Bannear’s work at the Bon Accord Mine site makes a firm foundation for a future full and complete history of the Bon Accord.

The Bon Accord site has been in the care of the Burra Mine Museum Committee for the past twelve months.  Bon Accord Cottage is still available for overnight accommodation and is run by Donna Slater.

The future of the Mt Bryan East School, which was bequeathed to us by the late Mr Gare, is under consideration and the Department of Recreation and Sport has indicated an interest in acquiring or leasing the building as accommodation for walkers on the Heysen Trail.

The transfer of Kotz Cottage from the Council to the National Trust has not been completed and is being reconsidered by Head Office.

The History Trust has given a grant of $1,400 for a conservation study of the museum and storage facilities.

Marj Edmonds’ tours of Malowen Lowarth continue to be popular.

We have begun to upgrade displays at the Redruth Gaol and soon further interpretation will be added.
