Burra Railway Station.

Since the railway station platform has been fenced off and a charge made to enter, it has become fashionable to parade the platform in view of those not wealthy enough to purchase a ticket.

‘The other evening on of the girls was “doing the grand” when someone asked “Who’s she?”

“Oh that’s Miss So-and-So.”

“Oh, good gracious, there’s nothing in going onto the platform if she is allowed on it.”

Then Miss So-and-So, hearing the remark, flicked her dress some more, pouted her lips, put out her tongue, and put on a frill that completely nonplussed the one on the outside.’

The new arrangements have also barred cabbies from presenting themselves at carriage doors.  Passengers now have to find their own way to the cabstand.
