Philanthropy.  After the pathetic McWaters’ incident last week when five children were left friendless and hungry with no one to say a kind word Joe (‘Battler’) Halls [11] appealed to his parents to take them in, promising to share his tucker with them if they did so.  Mr & Mrs T.P. Halls did take them in and cared for them.  Mrs Halls washed and ironed their clothes and Joe cleaned all their boots.  They were perfectly turned out for their appearance in court. [See below.]  Mr & Mrs Day sent along food to help them in the first stage of their troubles.
