Dudley Lehmann of Robertstown writes decrying those who oppose wind power and drawing attention to the great benefits of having electric power, unlike the past when kerosene lamps and candles ruled.  No one than complained when power poles appeared and brought electricity, or when free light towers were erected to generate electricity on farms. He also dismisses fears that birds will fly into the turning blades.  Electricity is such a vital component of modern life and â€˜those who complain about wind farms neglect that they are generating much needed electricity, wherever it comes from has to be a great help to everyone.
