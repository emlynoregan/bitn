Salvation Army.  The lady officers, Captain Stewart & Lieut. Butt, who have been in charge of the Salvation Army here for some months will be farewelled on Sunday.  They will be succeeded by Captain Deeble and probably Lieut. Gullick.  Captain Isabell Nicholls, who left here for the work several years ago, is visiting her native town.  Mrs Melksham will also visit Kooringa this week and all her friends will be glad to know she is now in excellent health.
