Ladies’ Meeting for the Centenary

On Tuesday night only sixteen turned up for this important meeting and given the amount of work the Centenary would involve, it was decided to meet again tomorrow night, when each woman present was asked to bring her friends along to spread the tasks among all the ladies residing in Burra.
