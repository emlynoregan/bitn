Obituary.  Pte Jim Hale of North Kensington was killed in action in New Guinea on 27 November.  He was brother to one of the sisters at St Joseph’s Convent in Burra.  Pte Hale had served in Egypt, Greece and Syria and had only just returned.  Before going north he visited his sister at Burra and obtained a half-holiday for the pupils at the convent when he visited them.  His four remaining brothers are at battle stations in northern areas.

[Perhaps Frederick James Hale born 25 August 1913 Clarence Park.]
