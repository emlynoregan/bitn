Obituary.  Arthur Lander Killicoat’s funeral in reported.

[The impression in the last issue was that his car was struck by a train while he was watching one coming the other way, but the account here suggests he simply drove into the train’s path without changing speed, which they put down to his being completely distracted.  Reports in the metropolitan papers would no doubt clear this up.]

The article on the funeral also says he was nicknamed ‘Bowsers’.  The accident occurred on 12 July and the funeral was on 13 July at the home of Mrs M. Killicoat, his mother, with the interment at the North Road Cemetery [Nailsworth] where there was a short service in the mortuary chapel.  The funeral was largely attended.  As well as friends and family his association with the firm of Silver & Killicoat of North Adelaide meant that nearly every motor firm in Adelaide was represented.
