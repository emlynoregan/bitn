Obituary.  William Albert Murray, noted sheep breeder of Cappeedee, aged 37 was taken ill on 27 November and removed to the Burra Hospital.  Peritonitis following an internal blockage resulted in his death on 3 December.  He was the youngest son of Mr John Murray of Mt Crawford and was devoted to maintaining the reputation of the famous Murray Merinos.  He was renowned as an emblem of honour, his name synonymous with straightness.  He is well remembered here from playing polo on the local ground with the brothers Bowman.

[The birth is registered as William Albert Murray 31 July 1862 and the death as William Arthur Murray 3 December 1901 aged 39]
