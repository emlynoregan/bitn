Mr & Mrs E. Moore were tendered a farewell from Farrell’s Flat by their Catholic friends last week.  They are moving to Burra.

Burra Races on Saturday offered a fine day’s sport.  The track was well attended to.  A special train ran from Adelaide.  The totalizator was well patronised and the race results are printed.

The main race was the Burra Handicap for £100 with the 2nd getting £15 from the stake.  It was won by H. Goddison’s mare Venus, a 5-year-old carrying 8 st 4 lb.
