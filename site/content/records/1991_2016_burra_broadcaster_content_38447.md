Burra Hospital has been able to complete the installation of electric beds as the result of a generous donation by the [Kooringa] Masonic Lodge of $10,000 from the sale of its building [in Thames Street].  This enabled the purchase of two electric beds and a lifter to complete the replacement of the old beds.  [Photo.]
