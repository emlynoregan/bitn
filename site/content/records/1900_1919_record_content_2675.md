James Gully was charged with having a bag of uncleaned wheat which might reasonably be suspected of having been stolen or unlawfully obtained.  Police alleged he took it from L. Gebhardt’s paddock and placed it on or adjacent to the railway line.  Gully said he ‘found’ it on the line when running the length in his work.  The acting ganger said finds on the line should be taken to the station.

William Manamly, a railway packer, reported seeing the bag adjacent to the line and reported it to his foreman, but didn’t know what the latter did.

Gully said while patrolling the line on Monday he saw the bag on ‘the Queen’s highway’ and threw it over the railway fence.  He said he expected to hear someone enquire about it, but nothing happened so on Friday I sent my boy (Ben) to get it.  Gully claimed not to know where the boy had put it till M-C Phelan pointed it out to him.  Bought it two miles towards Burra on the tricycle.  He did not report it as it was not found on railway property.  The bench found that though the amount was trifling the offence was serious and that Gully was guilty.  They decided on a lenient fine of 5/- plus costs of 15/-.  Mr Winnall said there would be an appeal and payment of the fine was deferred.
