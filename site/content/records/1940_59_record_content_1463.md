Obituary.  James A. Henderson died on Saturday evening at his Queen St residence.  He had been down the street and felt ill.  He was assisted home by Mr G. Herbert and died soon after the latter left.  He was born in January 1870, the elder son of the late Mr & Mrs William Henderson and was educated at Burra Model School before joining his father’s blacksmith and wheelwright business, then occupying the sites now held by SAFU and Mr Glan [sic] Tiver, garage proprietor.  When his father retired Mr Henderson followed his trade on Yardea Station for Messrs A.J. & P.A. McBride Ltd, but ill health forced his retirement several years ago.  In 1884 he married Miss Margaret Kathleen Kinnane of Walkerville, who survives with 8 surviving children (5 sons and 3 daughters): Will Henderson (Gawler), Roy Henderson (Adelaide), Jack Henderson (Farrell’s Flat), Laurie & Pat Henderson (Burra),* Nell, Mrs J.C. Lloyd (Hamilton SA), Kitty, Mrs H. Osborne (Adelaide), Jean Mrs Dudley Salter (Mannum) and 12 grandchildren.  Mrs Alex Harris of Vacleuse [sic] Sydney is a sister, as is Mrs Turley of Broken Hill, and Mr Roy Henderson of Adelaide is a brother.

* A handwritten note above Laurie & Pat says Adelaide + three illegible letters.

[James Andrew Henderson born 15 January 1870 Clare: died 27 April 1940 Burra.]
