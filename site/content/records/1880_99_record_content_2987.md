Burra Town Council, 3 Jan.

Cr Sampson asked if there was a reporter present and if so if he was under the control of the council, as he believed the reports ought to be done fully or not at all.  The Mayor said one was present, but was not under Council control.

Cr Batchelor said there was a need to lay the dust in Commercial St.

Messrs Francis Clark & Sons wrote requesting precise instructions re the Market Square well.  They were referred to earlier letters to proceed at once.

Cr Sampson gave notice of a motion to have troughs fixed in the square and provided with water pending the completion of the well and he thought that Messrs Dunstan and Ridgway had done well to get troughs near their premises in Aberdeen and a similar supply at Kooringa was important.

A move to place a light on the Market Square well enclosure was lost.

A request from the Bank of Australasia to place steps on the footpath in front of the bank was denied.

The rates for 1881 were declared at 1/- general and 3d health.

Cr Dunstan gave notice of a tree-planting rate to be decided at the next meeting.
