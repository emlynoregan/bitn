Kooringa News, 1 April

Persons holding shares in the Royal Mining Co. at Black Springs are in great spirits.  A few months ago the Patent Copper Co. made arrangements with the Royal to work an iron lode on one of their sections for use as a smelting flux.  On going down they found the lode gradually changed to copper and now a solid lode of copper three feet wide is presented.  It is hoped that better things will develop as work proceeds.  It is already known that in the Karkulto Mine, belonging to the Burra Burra Co. and lying adjacent to the Royal, a fine lode has been cut.

Major Nelson is in the Burra Hotel with a severe bilious attack.  He came up to see the Mine before leaving the colony.  He is under the care of Dr Mayne.

Two or three miners have left Burra to try their luck at the Echunga diggings as they heard that some new lead of gold has been struck there.
