Accident.  On Monday morning Mr Duncan Blair, accompanied by his wife, drove into Burra on business and on the way home in the evening the horse collided with a fence about a mile from the Bon Accord Hotel.  The cart capsized and Mrs Blair received a nasty head injury.  Cpl Noble had her conveyed to the hotel, but Dr Sangster then had her removed to the Burra Hospital.  Blair himself received a severe gash over the left eye and severe bruising.  It is a coincidence that only a few months ago he had both legs broken in an accident at almost the same spot.
