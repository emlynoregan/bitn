McPhee’s Saltbush Meats.  Recent publicity in the Mid North Broadcaster and The Advertiser has resulted in a great deal of interest in saltbush meat, with people even coming from the city to overnight in Burra before returning with a parcel of saltbush meat.  Gary McPhee is also pleased to employ local lads so they don’t have to leave the district to get work.
