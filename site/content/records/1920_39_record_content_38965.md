Frank Treloar: The History of a Once Well-Known Racehorse part 2.

Waif was ridden up to Clare where at Inchiquin Cadger was in training for racing in Adelaide.  Cadger was being paced by three other horses in stages and when the Waif was ridden in the training session he beat not only the pacers but Cadger quite easily.  Soon news got around and John Prest and Joe Freeman of Penwortham made an offer of £100 for Waif, which was accepted.

Prest trained Waif and changed his name to Cupbearer.  How he was taken to Adelaide and won the Adelaide Cup is racing history.

Tom Ryan youngest son of Paddy Ryan who discovered Moonta Mines built racing stables at Sevenhills.  John Prest became trainer and part of the arrangement was that ‘Mr Ryan brought Cupbearer for his next owner.’ [Sic: presumably meaning Ryan became the new owner of the horse.]

At one Kapunda race meeting Cupbearer dead-heated with another racehorse from Booyoolie that was exactly alike.  Later in the afternoon they had another race-off and dead-heated again.

[Treloar then recounts events at a race meeting on Taylor’s Block at Leasingham in 1868 or 1869 in which Cupbearer came third in a handicap event.]

Later Tom Ryan died and the stables were broken up.  The new owner took Cupbearer up the river for work, but it was hard times and he fared no better there and had to sell the horse who passed on to a station and eventually ended up at an outback boundary rider’s hut and gradually came to be ranked as a ‘has been’.

A mob of sheep were being sent to Kapunda market and Cupbearer was allocated the humiliating position of Cook’s caravan horse.  After the auction the droving plant was auctioned including the horses and eventually Cuppy was sold to Pat Quinliven for £6.
