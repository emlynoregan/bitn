Burra Town Council, 15 March

The SA Housing Trust said the Fair Rents Court has no jurisdiction over premises occupied by public institutions.

Cr Kellaway moved that the resolution to have three Members of Council discuss the occupancy of the Council Chamber with three Members of the Institute Committee be put into operation.

He moved the Council agree to pay £65 p.a. for sole right to the room with the committee to do the cleaning etc. and the Council to have three nights’ free use of the hall p.a.  Carried.

Mrs R.J. Jeffery of Burra Red Cross suggests a public meeting re a plaque for HMAS Burra-Bra.

Mr K.M. Drew complained of sheep wandering in streets of the town.

When Council wrote to Mr J. Brown requesting him as Ranger to see to it he had resigned.

The position will be advertised.

The ford opposite R. Fuss’s is to be tarred.  [St Just St.]

A beautifully designed Austerity Loan Pennant was placed in the Council Chamber.  It had been forwarded by Mr Lewis, organiser of the town.
