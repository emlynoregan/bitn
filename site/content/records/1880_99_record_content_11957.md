A Medical Officer must be appointed as required by the Central Board of Health.  The job will be thankless, as anyone reported or investigated will feel aggrieved.  A £20 fee could be squeezed from the present rate, but more would require an increased rate.  We cannot allow the Central Board to step in and make a costly appointment.
