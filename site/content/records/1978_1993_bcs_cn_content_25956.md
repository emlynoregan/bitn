John then took up a lecturing post with the SA Institute of Technology at Port Pirie and Barbara took over the Mail Bag Sunday School.  Both took an active interest in Missions to Seamen, YAF and other parish matters.  John undertook studies in Theology and became a lay reader, church warden, synodsman and synod seal holder.  When the Institute of Technology closed in Port Pirie the Devenports went to Adelaide.  John then went to Britain where he gained a B. Phil. degree in 1977 and an M. Sc. in 1978.  Barbara meanwhile took a course in accountancy and later studied taxation.  In 1987 John became a deacon and studied at St Barnabas College and St Francis Xavier Seminary and after ordination to the priesthood he became assistant priest at Christ Church North Adelaide.  He was subsequently locum tenens at Murray Bridge, Jamestown and Burra.
