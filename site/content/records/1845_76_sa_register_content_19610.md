‘A Miner’ writes to comment on a report that there is a contractor in Burra who would employ 20 good men:

There are 20 good men in Burra who have worked for him this last three weeks and would not do it again.  He works them from 7 to 12 without a rest and appears to think men are like a machine – never tired.  If he did not ‘nigger-drive’ his men he would get plenty in this neighbourhood.  He offers men 4/- a chain to dig a drain 3 feet wide at the top, 18 inches deep and 9 inches wide at the bottom.  I leave you to judge whether that is enough.  (Kooringa 15 August.)
