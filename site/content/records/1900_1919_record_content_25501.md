A voice said – ‘You want Tom Rabbich with you now.’

‘Some very injudicious remarks have been made in reference to his candidature, but he was willing to forgive and forget.’

Mr Crewes supported the vote of thanks.

He could not help, but refer to the way his opponent was trotted out after he (Crewes) had sent in his resignation to Council, but he had now finished with Municipal matters and would never again allow himself to be nominated, but he would watch the work done in Council meetings from time to time.  He was consoled by the men who stood on street corners who admitted he was the best man for the position.

Groans and cries of ‘Sit down’ and ‘Your talking rot’. [sic]

Crewes – ‘Will you get that man put outside Mr Chairman.’

A Voice – ‘Look here, Crewes, it would take a better man than you to put me out.’

The Chair said he was repeating what was said at the ratepayers’ meeting, which was inappropriate here.

But Crewes continued in the same theme for a while.  He thanked the 152 ratepayers who voted for him and was glad to know ‘There were at least that number of sensible people in the town.’

S.M. Lane thanked ratepayers for returning him unopposed.

A. Harris thanked his supporters, as did C.A. Lott.
