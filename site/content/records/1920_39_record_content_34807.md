Burra Rifle Club AGM was held 5 July at J. Allen’s rooms with C.W. Pearce in the chair.

Over 20 members attended.  The club had received valuable assistance with trophies from T.H. Woollacott & Sons and Messrs G.G. & Rollo Hawkes, Frank Spencer and various club members.  They were also under obligation to Messrs Warnes & C.W. Gare for use of lands for the ranges and to The Record for reporting their activities.  A new target had been erected in anticipation of the Anzac Shoot, which had later been cancelled.

[Extensive details of prizes follow and these have mostly been noted previously.]

Elected were Captain, H.G. Oates; Vice-Captain, J.A. Riggs; Treasurer, A.B. Riggs; Secretary – held over.

Miss Bubb was farewelled at the monthly meeting of the Women’s Branch of the Liberal Federation and presented with a gold ever-sharp pencil suitably inscribed.
