Burra Lawn Tennis Club is opening for play earlier this year, on 20 October.

They have at present four splendid grass courts and hope a fifth will be ready by the end of the year.  Much credit is due to Mr Reg. Ellis for work in re-blocking and top-dressing the courts and also to Gilbert Wilson.  Mr A.L. Bence has been elected President.
