Burra Burra DC

$100,000 in outstanding rates is overdue.  Of the districtâ€™s 1,600 ratepayers only 400 have paid their rates and of those the majority are from the town of Burra.  Carrying the burden of unpaid rates for eight months of the year means that much work does not get done.  Main roads get work from Government Grants.  Local roads must wait for rate payment.
