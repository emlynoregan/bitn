Burra Home Buyers are hurt by Mortgage Insurance Policy

Burra home buyers are typically asked to pay 20% down while a similarly priced house in Clare requires only a 5% deposit.  Bank can loan only up to 80% of the purchase price and when customers want more, mortgage insurance from underwriters is required.  Location determines the criteria of the insurance that will allow more to be lent.  There is of course a lower risk on loaning money on houses that increase in value as time passes.  Burra houses are at a disadvantage in this respect, though properties have been on the move, with prices changing a lot even in the last six months.
