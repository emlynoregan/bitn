Mt Bryan & Hallett Water Scheme

Mr Allen MP undertook to look into the report on the proposed water scheme for Mt Bryan and Hallett made by the E & WS Department.  The Department found that such a scheme would not be practical.  The towns are too small to recover even the interest on the capital invested.  Clare for example used 90 million gallons in 1967-68 and the cost of getting water pumped from Farrell Flat to Clare was 75 cents per 1,000 gallons.  Burra receives water pumped from Hanson and used 41 million gallons at a cost of $1.05 per 1,000 gallons.  The Minister of Works states the cost of supplying River Murray water to Mt Bryan would be $175,000.  If all landowners between Mt Bryan and Burra paid the normal rate of 27c per acre on all land within one mile of the pipeline the revenue would be c. $3,456.  Rates from the town would not bring in more than $1,000.  This would represent 2Â½% interest on the capital cost and this does not include the actual cost of pumping or general maintenance.  Some landowners are not prepared to contribute so the Minister is correct in saying it is impracticable.  An alternative local source is also full of difficulties.  Good supplies of [bore] water are available, but are too poor for use in hot water systems.  Also, if supplied, all vacant blocks would be rateable for the minimum rates of $8 per year.

The Minister of Works said the matter had been investigated following a petition from landowners between Mt Bryan and Burra for Murray water to be extended to Mt Bryan with a pipe of sufficient size to enable later extension to Hallett.  Two pumping stations and two tanks would be needed.  The proposal needs 10 miles of 8 inch main and a 100,000 gallon surface tank at Mt Bryan.  Expenditure of $170,000 to reach Mt Bryan and a further $145,000 to include Hallett.  Three landowners indicated intention to irrigate lucerne.  All properties have adequate stock water supplies and it is unsound for the E & WS to provide Murray water for lucerne irrigation.  Neither scheme can be justified.  A report on the likelihood of obtaining supplies from bores in Mt Bryan area has been asked for.
