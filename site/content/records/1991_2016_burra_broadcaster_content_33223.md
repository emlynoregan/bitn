Jailhouse Rock

The Rock ’n’ Roll Weekend started on Friday night when Paul O’Bryan’s Band played at the Burra Hotel.  On Saturday morning there was a dance competition in Market Square with Paul O’Bryan’s Band again.  Saturday morning also featured cars and motor cycles in a Show and Shine along with SA Super Trikes.  Quite a few people then headed for the Booborowie Hotel for the afternoon, where the fun continued.  More than 250 people attended the main event at the Redruth Gaol on Saturday night, which was a 20% increase on last year.  Paul O’Bryan’s Band kept up the tempo into the night.  About 170 people capped the weekend off with a leisurely brunch on the Burra creek bank on Sunday morning.  [2 photos]
