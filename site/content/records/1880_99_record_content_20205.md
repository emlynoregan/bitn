Answers to Questions etc.

Details of various Redruth Reserves are given.

Mr Packard, candidate for the Mayoralty said his policies would be to work as economically as possible and to look into the case of the police moiety and move to have Burra treated equally with other towns.

Mr Anderson, candidate for East Ward, was prepared to answer questions.

Cr Sampson said they had not been a very happy family in Council and as a result many things were done that shouldn’t have been and others that should have been were not done.  Still, good work was done - Hill St for example.  Little had been possible in East Ward as it had to pay £50 for the footway in West Ward and began £60 in debt, so that of an allocation of £350, £110 had given no return.

Cr Ridgway had constantly been doing works not authorised.

The ford had not been before Council.  He objected to the reserve being handed over to Cr Ridgway.

The Mayor had enclosed a piece of reserve with a stone wall and made it part of his own property.

(The Mayor interjected - That is not true!)

Another piece of land had been enclosed.

He then outlined his scheme for amalgamation of jobs.

The dayman’s wages should be 7/- a day.

The scavenger should get more: 10/- instead of 9/-.

The Mayor said he had permission to plant the reserve and if the ratepayers did not like the wall and trees they could remove them.

Cr Tiver had been in Council two years ‘and if ever there was a drone in Council it was Cr Sampson, and if ever there was a traitor in the camp it was Cr Sampson.’

Cr Ridgway said there was so much dissatisfaction because he had done too much, and he had handed his resignation to the Town Clerk.

[A lot of intricate crossfire then followed.]

The opinion was expressed that SAMA should fit guttering to their roofs where they overhung footpaths and be compelled to do so by a by-law if necessary.

After a vote of thanks to the Mayor was moved he said ‘he would not take the place again for £200’.
