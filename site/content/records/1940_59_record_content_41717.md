Mr N. Fabian from Adelaide has been appointed District Clerk.  He is a returned man with 5 years AIF service.

Burra Rifle Club.  In the final shoot for the year on Saturday over 200 & double 300 yards Pat Hogan won the trophy and in the marksman’s contest F.T. Marston was just ahead, but crashed in the second 300 yards contest, getting only 28 and so Pat Hogan won that as well.

The Diggers’ Golf Trophy was contested at Crystal Brook.  About 1200 competed in this handicap event from all over the state.  Len Bence of Burra defeated Len Murdoch in a play-off after they had tied.  Overall the Burra team came fourth for the day.
