Theft.  $10 was taken from the till at Opperman’s Saveway Store in Burra on Saturday night.  Cash is not usually left in the store, but this night two $5 notes had been left in the till.  The large sliding door at the rear had been forced.  The space for entry is small, suggesting a child was the person who entered.
