River Murray Water

Mr Quirke MP has been advised by the Minister of Works that the route for the second Morgan-Whyalla pipeline is currently being investigated.  A duplication of the existing line would rule out Wirrabara, Melrose, Booleroo Centre and Appila, but a more northerly line would pass within a practical range of these towns and of Burra.  The present debate is whether to spend more if necessary to include these centres or to give better supplies to those already served.  Until this is resolved, there is no point in considering a separate scheme to bring Murray water to Burra.
