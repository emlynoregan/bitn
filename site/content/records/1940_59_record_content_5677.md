T.W. Wilkinson’s Chemist and Newsagent.  Mr Rex Martin has now been with the town long enough to have endeared himself to the community.  He is willing and ready to give service dispensing medicine day or night, having taken over the respected name of T.W. Wilkinson, who was the owner for so many decades.  In addition to dispensing work, he carries a wide range of proprietary lines, cosmetics, sick room and nursery equipment, prophylactics and the usual chemists’ sundries.  Next door is a well-stocked newsagents and booksellers’ shop.
