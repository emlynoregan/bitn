The Discoverer of the Burra Burra

‘Philanthropos’ writes from Gawler Town, 30 July 1848.

[He writes concerning the ‘long-promised, patiently-waited-for reward to a deserving individual from the proprietors of the Burra Burra Mine.’]

I was sorry recently to see the discovery of the Burra Burra Mine in straightened circumstances.  Especially when the colony owes so much of its present prosperity to that discovery and when it was at its lowest ebb at the time of the discovery.  He is earning his bread by laborious means, which his advancing age will soon render him unfit to pursue.  He assured me he had not even received the reward he was originally promised.

‘I hope the rich Burra Burra proprietors will not continue to think that the empty reward of bootless fame is sufficient for a man whom Divine Providence made the instrument of reviving the almost extinguished hopes of the colony.

The proprietors can no longer plead that they are waiting to see how the mine will turn out, it has already done wonders, for them, and for us all, so that if they do not presently reward him as he deserves, I hope you will set on foot a subscription for him, without reference to the rich proprietors more especially concerned; I send you my address and shall be happy to give my mite when called upon.’

[The editor of the SA Register then says they will be happy to take charge of any contributions for the benefit of this discover, ‘as we are compelled to despair of any tardy justice being done him’.  This was the second or third appeal forwarded to the paper on his behalf.]
