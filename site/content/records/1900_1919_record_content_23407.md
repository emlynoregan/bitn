Bible Christian Church Demolition continued this week, but slow progress was made.  The bulging part of the wall was made safe with the aid of a crab-winch and the northern gable held together as it rotated and fell to the ground in a piece, where it crumbled.  The slates weighed c. 6 lb 10 oz each and had they been replaced by iron the building would no doubt have stood without the walls decaying.  The sale of the pictures of the demolition has been phenomenal.
