Kooringa News

An elderly man named Thomas Thomas, bent nearly double, has been soliciting alms from door to door.  He has been presenting a petition signed by John Bowden JP, setting out his misfortunes as a way to open the hearts and pockets of the community.  On Wednesday evening he was found drunk and taken into custody.  The police found the petition and also some papers he had left at the Burra Hotel.  One paper was an agreement between Thomas Thomas and another to divide a certain section between them.  Another was a bill or acceptance worth £29, in favour of Thomas Thomas and nearly due.  A third stated the brands and descriptions of his (Thomas Thomas’s) cattle.  The public can make their own judgement, but he is at present lodged in Perry’s Hotel, alias the Redruth Gaol.
