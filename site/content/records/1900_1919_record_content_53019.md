Thomas B. Ashton writes concerning the settlement offered by the Hospital Board as already reported.  A reply by Wednesday is requested.

Dr Ashton wrote on 28 November that he had to submit his reply to his solicitor before sending it, as the trouble is mixed with pending litigation.

The requirement to attend Board meetings when required cannot be met with an unqualified undertaking, due to the nature of a doctor’s calling.

I am unable to acquiesce in the implied suggestion that my dismissal was not the consequence of my non-compliance with the instruction to give instructions to the Matron and charge-nurses in writing.

‘The intimation did not contain the words ‘general instructions’ and was not given by the secretary, but by Mr Winnall himself, in a letter written on his professional letter paper, containing reference to the resignation of Nurse Fuss.’

‘Dr Williams . . . was not favoured with a similar intimation to give direction to nurses in writing, though he did receive similar intimation re Nurse Fuss.’
