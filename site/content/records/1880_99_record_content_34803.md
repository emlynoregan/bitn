Editorial on The Old Year.

There is more than a column of verbose waffle before some more specific comments.

1889 was for SA a year of good rains.

Wool prices were better.

The wheat yield was good, but marred by red rust with av. yields c. 9 bushels.

Politically it had been a barren year.

Locally Burra had one member in the Government.

The mine seems likely to change hands soon.

The Town Council’s efforts have improved the town’s appearance.

Primitive Methodist Sunday School Anniversary 22 December, continued 25 December.  Rev. J.H. Ashton, Rev. T.M. Rowe & Rev. S. Gray preached on 22 December.  The Christmas Day children’s treat provided them with tea, cakes, tarts, sandwiches, etc.  Wheatley’s Band attended.  The public meeting revealed there were over 100 students and 15 teachers.  Proceeds exceeded £17.

Burra Co. VF.  City volunteers visited yesterday and a 10 men a side rifle match was fired.  Burra 409, defeated Adelaide Visitors 355.
