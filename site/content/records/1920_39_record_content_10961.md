Court.

William Joseph Rzeszkowoski was arrested at Farrell’s Flat on Thursday and given six months in jail for being a rogue and a vagabond.  This is his 9th conviction on various charges and only last week we reported a suspended sentence of one month if he left Burra within five hours.

A companion A.T.S. Beaglehole was sentenced to one month jail for be idle and disorderly.

A Writer from Farrell’s Flat objects to the practice of giving undesirables so many hours to leave the town.  Country people don’t like it when Adelaide Magistrates do it; Farrell’s Flat doesn’t like it when Burra Magistrates do so.  The undesirables then move to a less supervised place.

[This complaint was triggered specifically by the case of William Joseph Rzeszkwska, who is also reported as Rzeszkowoski.]
