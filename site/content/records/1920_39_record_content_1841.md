Burra Town Council

The Salvation Army was granted permission to hold Friday evening meetings close to the footpath opposite the ruins instead of in the middle of Market Square.  [i.e. on the south side of the square.]

Permission was granted for R.L. Gordon to erect a five-roomed house in Commercial St.

A lamp is to be placed on Sharpe’s Corner near the Kooringa Hotel.

A.J. McBride has offered the Hampton Quarry to the town and the offer was accepted.
