Essington Lewis has presented the town with two prints of Kooringa in the early days.  He will formally hand them over on Monday night to the safe keeping of the Burra Town Council.

[These are most likely watercolours by S.T. Gill, presently in the Burra Regional Art Gallery, though this needs to be verified.]
