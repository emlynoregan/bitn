Inquest/Obituary.  Mr Porter JP held an inquest into the death of James Reed at the White Hart Hotel on Sunday.  Mr Reed lately settled at Mt Bryan and was the son of J.S. Reed, the proprietor of the White Hart Hotel.  On Friday the deceased had complained of vomiting and stomach cramps, but went to work.  He died at 3 a.m. Saturday at his home some eleven miles from Dr Dashwood’s.  The Doctor was sent for, but Mr Reed was dead by the time the message reached him.  James Kelly gave evidence of the progress of the illness.  Patrick Kelly said he had been living with the deceased for three years six months and when the deceased has complained of being purged in the morning he had thought it was due to the previous night’s meal of sucking pig.  Reed had been winnowing smutty wheat.   He had not wanted the doctor sent for; asking only for some medicine.  Marie Dunneman, a young woman staying with Mrs Reed corroborated the details of the illness.  Dr Dashwood said the message received had not suggested any urgency, so he had made up some medicine and then taken the mail cart to see another patient at Waterloo.  He judged that death was due to Asiatic cholera.  A few hours after death the body was quite black and swollen and emitted such an effluvium that approach was difficult.  The verdict was death from natural causes.
