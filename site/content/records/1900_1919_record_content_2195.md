Recent Flood Damage has been greater than first thought.  The Council has made application to the government for Â£150 to repair roads, some of which remain impassable.  Farmers lost hundreds of tons of fallow soil while Mr W. Finch now says he has saved his wheat crop which had been reported lost.  Mr E.N. Finch lost about six tons of hay.
