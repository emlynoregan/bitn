Cricket.  On Saturday Kooringa needed 116 runs to win, with 8 wickets in hand.  They managed 202 in their first innings, but could get only 87 in the second innings for a total of 289.  Buffs scored 177 & 162 for 339 and so won the shield.  They have won it three times in succession and it becomes their absolute property.  In the second innings Kotz took 7 for 18 [or this is probably what is meant in a somewhat confusing statement.]
