Burra Burra DC

A.L. Clode’s tender for tiling the Caravan Park amenities block was accepted for $799.45.

The town house was let to Mrs Hallion.  [The Town Hall house?]

Eight tables with particle board tops were bought for the Town Hall.

Council’s contribution to the Burra Hospital is to be £2,12.00.  [Sic: clearly not correct.  £2,120 perhaps?]

Council advised ETSA that it had no objection to having street lights burning all night, following ETSA’s offer of an all night lighting tariff.
