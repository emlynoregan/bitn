Letter from Peter Brodie about the operation of the Lower North Health Advisory Council.  At first he was told he could attend its meetings as a silent observer, but then this was reversed.  Then there were going to be two public meetings, but neither occurred.  The HAC has decided it only has to provide minutes to its members.  It appears to be a secret society.  ‘Do Burra and District Residents care about the continuation of services at Burra Hospital’. [Sic.]
