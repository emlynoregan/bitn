Burra Burra Mines

Numerous persons have been applying for work at the mine and with the prospect of sufficient labour, the Directors have decided upon setting the large engine in motion and getting the water into fork.  It is now two years and two months since pumping ceased.  The water then rose in about six weeks until it reached the 22 fathom level; the level it was originally.  Instructions were sent to Captain Roach last Wednesday to resume operations.  The Directors start for the Mine this morning and had hoped to see the engine in operation, but this is unlikely.  Nevertheless there is not likely to be much delay.  After the water is lowered there will be a careful inspection of each level to ensure safety and as the water can expect to be lowered in about six weeks, we may expect operation at depth to begin an about eight weeks.  This information is of great importance to miners both here and in Victoria and although not official, can be taken as correct.  The Directors are expected back on Friday, when we can expect an announcement on the re-opening of the deep levels.
