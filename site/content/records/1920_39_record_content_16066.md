Obituary.  J.E.H. Winnall [John Edward Hyde Winnall born 1 April 1864 at Kooringa.]

The news arrived in Burra last Friday of the death of our late townsman.  He was born in Queen St Kooringa in 1864.  The house was later that of J.M. McBride and is now J.C. Killicoat’s.  The family went to live in Adelaide and when he was about 26 years old he returned as a solicitor and for many years was the legal adviser and friend of many.  Until his departure in July 1923 he was one of the town’s hardest workers.  As a young man he was a fine athlete and his interest in sport continued in later years when he gave practical support.  He was the first Mayor to have been born in Burra.  He was Mayor for two years and a councillor for six.  He was a member of the Hospital Board for 27 years and Chairman & Vice-Chairman of the Board for many of them.  He was a member of the Institute Committee for 23 years, President for 3 and a trustee till his death.  He was a chorister at St Mary’s for 25 years, a warden for 23, a lay-reader for 12 and also a synodsman and trustee.  He served the Burra Show Committee for 27 years as member and Chairman of the Finance Committee as well as being a steward and judge.  He was active in the Liberal Union as Vice-President of the branch, a delegate and a member of the District Executive.  He worked to get a High School for Burra and served on the School Board, being Chairman some years.  He served on almost every public committee in the town and took a leading part in concerts, drama and opera.  He was also a keen gardener.  He married Miss Jessie Sprod.  His eldest daughter was Miss Nell Winnall (of Colombo Ceylon).  His eldest son is Jack (of Wilgena Station), Bob is in the Australian Navy and at home in Adelaide are Misses Jessie and Masters Harry & Tom.

[Died 21 May 1925 at St Peters aged 60.]
