  Golf

  The 10th Bronze Meeting of the SA Ladies’ Gold Association was held at Burra last Tuesday, Wednesday & Thursday.  The winner was former Burra golfer Mrs M. Scriven of Mt Barker.  Monday saw many competitors practising in cold and wet conditions.  Tuesday was finer, but very cold.  Wednesday was sunny.  Windy and cold conditions returned for the final day.  The 128 golfers who participated fully taxed Burra’s hotel accommodation.  Mrs Scriven is the wife of a former Burra High School headmaster.
