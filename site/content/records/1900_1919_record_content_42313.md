Burra Show Society.  Meeting last Friday with I.J. Warnes in the chair.

The committee for the Sheep Dog Trials decided to allow dogs in the Novice Class to compete for the Championship Cup because this was allowed by the Strathalbyn Rules.  This was against a resolution of the Burra Agricultural [Show] Society, which barred them.  The committee also decided on one judge for the day when the annual meeting had decided on two.  Mr Warnes believed the committee was bound by the resolutions of the AGM.  The committee held that such resolutions were recommendations only.

Mr Warnes held they were wrong, but even if it were so they would have to report back to the Burra Show Soc. And when the committee decided to go on with the program he decided to call the present meeting.  Since then the card from the Strathalbyn Society showed that only Open Class dogs competed in the Championship.

After a long and at times heated discussion it was resolved that the lines on which the Championship was decided at Strathalbyn should be strictly adhered to at Burra.

The secretary was inclined to resign.  He said if the President and not Mr Radford had been in the chair at the time there would have been no trouble.
