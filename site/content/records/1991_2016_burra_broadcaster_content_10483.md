Burra Burra DC

Council will continue to operate the Burra Tourist Office, but with an increasing focus on it as a commercial entity â€“ aiming for a balanced budget for the office in the 1996-97 financial year.  Under this arrangement it will no longer provide the function of booking accommodation for visitors, neither will it book tours to private operators.  Souvenirs and consignment goods will no longer be for sale.  The upstairs room of the centre will not be used at all due to the hazardous nature of the stairs.
