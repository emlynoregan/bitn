Burra Conservation Study

Part II Section 5.  Guidelines for Market Square

The progressive erosion of the historic character of Market Square is often the result of single small acts by individuals.  It is important that the establishment of the essential qualities of Market Square is achieved over time by influencing the efforts and actions of the people and shopkeepers actively involved it its day to day functions.  Recent developments have not reinforced the continuity of the arcaded space and elevated pedestrian areas.

The recent Post Office to the south [1960] for instance interrupted the live of verandahed shops.  This sort of development should be avoided in the future.

The elimination of verandah posts and their replacement by cantilevered or hung awnings should also be resisted.  Although such awnings provide shade and shelter, the rhythm, definition of space and the measure of protection from cars provided by posts is lost.

The excuse for the elimination of posts is based on the practice of drivers parking their cars as horses were once left; with their head (or motor) in.  Today bumpers tend to overlap gutters and damage posts, which has led to the angled support or the removal of posts.  The problem is not with the posts, but with the car.
