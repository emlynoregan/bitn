17 July.  There was a further warm exchange involving Cr Hardy and Cr West.  Cr West moved that the Municipal Association have movable meetings instead of their always being in Adelaide.

7 August.  Cr Parks moved censure on the Record accusing it of misrepresenting Council in its report of the meeting of 17 July and published on 19 July.  Cr Harris 2nd.

Cr Hardy made supporting comments.  The motion was carried on the casting vote of the Mayor.  Offence was taken over the reporting of the fish incident and the Inspector was called to be asked if he had talked to the Record.  (Cr Parks reported some bad smelling fish under the Bridge St Bridge, but they were never found.)

21 August.  A long-running high farce commenced when Cr Harris moved the Council go into committee.  2nd Cr Parks.  The object was to remove the Record reporter.  This passed on the casting vote of the Mayor.  Councillors West, Walsh and Linkson then walked out.  Although he is supposed to sign all cheques as chair of the finance committee, Cr Walsh could not do so for several meetings as he would not be a party to transacting business with closed doors.

4 September.  Cr Parks moved the room be cleared of strangers.  Again the casting vote of the Mayor carried it.  Confusion followed as Mr Davey was asked to leave, heightened by the fact he has the same name as the Town Clerk.  When he refused to leave, the meeting was adjourned.

12 September.  At the Council meeting Cr Hardy moved the assessment for 1893 be adopted for 1894.  (Amotion he moved again at the meeting on 2 October.)

Cr Linkson handed in a protest that the meeting was illegal in accordance with by-law 1 section 71 because the adjournment of the 4 September had not stated to what day and hour.  The protest was ignored.  When asked to leave several ratepayers refused and though others were named Mr Davey was not.  The Mayor then produced a pre-prepared note saying that Mr Davey was obstructing the meeting and sent the note to the police.  The police cleared the room and the usual three Councillors followed.  After the meeting a deputation called on the Mayor to convene a public meeting of ratepayers.

At the start of the year Cr Hardy and Cr Parks were not on good speaking terms, but later became bosom friends.  Cr Parks and the Mayor fell out badly, but are now showing the warmest love.  Councillors Walsh, West and Linkson have been the most consistent.  Cr Harris entered as an independent, but after a month commenced to waver.  Cr Hardy and his actions are so well known no comment is needed.

J.D. Cave writes pointing out that savings at the Waterworks are not really possible.  In 1892 income exceeded expenditure by only £1-7-2.  Since 1892 there has been an increase in the capital account requiring about £10 additional interest and the interest due to the Government, c. £200 falls due in February.  No rates come in before March or April so an overdraft will also be required.

Burra Town Council.

On rising the Council resolved to adjourn till the last Thursday in November.

c. £238 in water rates remain unpaid.

In the general account £59 was owing.

It was resolved to repair the pump in Market Square.
