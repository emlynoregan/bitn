Surprise Party.  Another surprise party is reported.  On Wednesday 30-40 persons, members of the new Silver Club, went to E.N. Finch’s residence ‘Pencarrow’, where dancing took place in the barn.

[Surely the sending out of a piano a fortnight earlier must have affected the ‘surprise’ somewhat.]  People returned home about 3 a.m.
