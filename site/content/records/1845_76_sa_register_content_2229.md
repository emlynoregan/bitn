SA Mining Association.  Editorial comment on the 3rd annual report:

‘Within nine months, ended in March last, five dividends have been paid, making six hundred percent. upon the paid up capital, and amounting to seventy-three thousand nine hundred and twenty pounds; and such is the flourishing condition of the Association’s finances, and such their territorial prospects, that the Directors declare their intention to pay two hundred per cent., or, in other words, £24,640, on the first day of every third month; being equivalent to ninety-eight thousand five hundred and sixty pounds per annum.

Success so triumphant, coupled with such a prospect of permanency, is, we believe, without a parallel.’
