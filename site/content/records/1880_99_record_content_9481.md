Hargrave was to report on the possibility of a water supply using an elevated reservoir.  He took levels to ‘Gilberts’ and the Brewery Paddock wells and found that at ‘Gilberts’ the water level was 19’ above that in the Market Square well.  The Brewery Paddock well level was 82’ above the Market Square level.  Portions of the area to be served are above these levels.  An elevated reservoir would supply water for inhabitants and for fire use.  The suggested supply is 50,000 gallons a day and therefore Hargraves fixed the reservoir at 150,000 gallons, or three days’ supply.  This is not excessive considering fire or if the Corporation should decide to erect public baths.  The water in the Market Square well contains sulphate of magnesia, calcium sulphate and sodium chloride, but not in sufficient quantity to be deleterious.  Steam power is the only reliable means of pumping the required quantity of water.  [Hargrave discusses the wind power possibilities, but dismisses them.]
