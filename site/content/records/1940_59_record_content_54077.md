Hubert O. Pederick reiterates his statement that no students had to bring shorts and shoes to clean out the tanks and none has done so despite anything said at a Local Board of Health meeting.  The making of the roof pigeon-proof is not simple.  They nest right in the deep well gutters in the centre of the school.  Vents and gutterings have been overhauled in recent years.  One solution would be to drain away water from the central area and capture only that from the outer roof.  Another is to capture water only from the larger shelter sheds.  The Inspector of Schools says the Department view is that the service water was drinkable [i.e. the town supply.]
