Burra Primary School

Mr Ian Auhl was farewelled by students on Thursday afternoon at a ceremony at the Burra Primary School.  With his great knowledge of local history he proved to be a teacher to many adults as well as to his school pupils.  Mrs Perry spoke for students and staff and said that both students and staff were deeply sorry to be losing both Mr & Mrs Auhl.  Penny Miller made a neat little speech, and helped by Debbie Kirk, made a presentation of a silver jug.  Chairman of the School Committee Mr R. Moreland added his appreciation.  Mrs Carpenter spoke on behalf of the School Welfare Club and also as a staff member.  Rev. Geoffrey Sibly spoke for the religious instructors.  Mr Auhl replied saying it was hard to leave a school where he had a school and student to be proud of.  He paid tribute to the great assistance of his wife.  Prize-giving and presentation of Progress Certificates was also held on Thursday.

Alan Braendler & Robert Padbury shared the Andrew Tennant Award for Dux of Grade VII.

Dux of the Girls was Carolyn Nicholls.

This is likely to be the last year Progress Certificates will be awarded.

Mrs N. Said was farewelled.

[Various prizes and awards are listed.]
