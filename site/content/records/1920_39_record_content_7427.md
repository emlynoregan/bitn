A.E. Sampson has been visiting as a representative of Duncan and Fraser Ltd. (Ford and other cars.)  The article says he was racing bicycles here twenty-two years earlier, when he was riding a ‘high bicycle’ along with Harry Gully.  The races took place on 26 December and the pair later rode ‘their 50-odd inch racers’ to Adelaide in record time.
