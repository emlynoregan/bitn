Burra Police Capture Thief

Three men stole a car in Adelaide, the property of Harry Roy Fuss.  The Burra police heard that a strange car had been seen in the vicinity of Woolgangi, headed towards Burra.  On Thursday afternoon MC France noticed three strangers in town and on questioning them, thought their story a bit thin.  He loaded them into his car and took them out to the racecourse where he found another man and a car.  On the back seat he noticed several items among which was a clock he recognised from Murkaby Station.  The men were arrested and Adelaide Police later verified the ownership of the car.  At 7.45 a.m. the next morning the men were found to have escaped by making a hole in the cell wall.  MC Sparrow of Burra informed the constable that a car of Goldsbrough Mort & Co. had been stolen.  This was abandoned at Oodlawirra in favour of one belonging to Frank Witty of there.

This broke down after ten miles, whereupon the men boarded a goods train and MC Clarke, assisted by two Peterborough Police arrested them when they reached Yunta.  They were tried at Peterborough for the theft of Mr Witty’s car and given six weeks each.  They were then returned to Burra in Goldsbrough Mort’s vehicle.  They were then tried and sentenced to terms ranging from six to twelve months.
