Mt Bryan

A concrete path has recently been laid around the Soldiers’ Memorial Hall.

Funds came from the Hall Auxiliary, Goyder Council, & Mt Bryan Table Tennis Club (dispersal).

An Italian feast night was held in the hall, attended by c. 60 people.

Mt Bryan Progress Association has received two grants.  One from the  Department of Families Housing Community Services and Indigenous Affairs to get a ladder and scaffold package to increase the safety of volunteers; another from AGL to buy a spray unit to reach difficult places.

The Hall Committee also received a grant from FaHCSIA to purchase two gas stoves & to cover installation costs and one from AGL for 100 new chairs.

Members of the Burra Sing Australia Choir were at Mt Bryan Hall on the occasion of the South Devon Cattle Breeders Association Dinner recently.  The program included an all-Australian repertoire to entertain the international guests.
