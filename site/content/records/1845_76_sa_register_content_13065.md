Kooringa News, 8 February

The Telegraph Station, being constructed by the contractor Mr Francis of Adelaide, is making rapid step towards completion.  In the meantime its business is being conducted in the Mechanics’ Institute.  It is dealing with more business than was anticipated.

The walls of the New Kooringa Bible Christian Chapel are nearing completion.  Mr Burgoyne, the contractor, will derive considerable credit from the manner in which he has carried out his contract.

Charles Schutz was injured at the Mine today, but no serious result is anticipated.

Mr Baker of one of the Adelaide Cricket Clubs issued a challenge to play an eleven from the club here, but having seen them practise he has declined it.
