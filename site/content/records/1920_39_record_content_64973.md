The news of Mr George Sampson’s death reached Kooringa on Saturday when Mrs Clem Sampson received a phone message from her husband.  The cause of death was fever and pneumonia.  The late Mr Sampson was born at Kooringa in 1904, the second son of the late George and Sarah Sampson of Kooringa.  After leaving school he assisted his father, who was a well-known dam-sinker in the north and northeast.  After his parents’ deaths he went to Broken Hill, but for many years now has been associated with his eldest brother, Mr Clem Sampson, and they were on a big dam-sinking contract when Mr George Sampson was taken ill.  He leaves a widow, nee Florence Pearce of Broken Hill and two daughters aged 10 and 8.  He is survived by two brothers and two sisters: W.C. Sampson (Burra), Allan Sampson (Iron Knob), Mrs Edith Boehm & Mrs Silby Jarrett (both of Renmark).
