Johnny Green

At the last meeting of the Town Council the Mayor said four Councillors had inspected sites for placing ‘Johnny Green’.  He considered the corner of McBride’s paddock on the left hand side of the Mine Bridge was the best.  He said it deserved a formal opening ceremony.

Cr March said several old residents were supportive enough to contribute towards any expense involved.  The Mayor said the idea was to invite Mr P.A. McBride MP to perform the ceremony.  A.J. & P.A. McBride had given the Council the Mine Pool and the effigy.

Cr Jennison, with an eye to expense, was against any official ceremony.

The Mayor said there would be no expense.

Cr Dow thought that with the weather and vandalism the effigy would not last long and that it did not justify making a fuss.

The Mayor regretted the loss of old landmarks, but Cr Dow thought they blocked progress.

Cr Riggs also opposed any ceremony.

The Overseer said it was as solid as the day it was erected except for a few bullet holes.  He had given it two coats of paint.

The motion to leave it in the hands of the Mayor lapsed.

The Mayor regretted there not being an opening ceremony where a collection for the unemployed could have been made.
