‘Steel Beak’ writes a long article of c. 1¾ columns in response to the editor’s suggestion that as well as making an analysis of the ills of the world he should have some suggestions of the remedy.

He says we need:

A substitute for the world markets.

A sound method of allocation and distribution in substitution for the slavery to gold.

Payment of debts without destroying development and prosperity.

He seems to advocate a larger Australian population in respect to 1 above.

The currency should be backed by land and work done rather than gold.

As for the unemployed; if each man had five acres they could subsist and the resuscitated industries would provide employment too.  There could be co-operative settlements on the five acres in groups of 200 with large areas of commonage.  He also suggests a form of bank nationalisation and a Crown Bank which for purposes of international trade would hold gold to effect overseas payments.  Imports would be limited to what Australia could not produce.  Australia must become self sufficient.  All this would require a new constitutional arrangement and a remodelling of the country politically and judicially.
