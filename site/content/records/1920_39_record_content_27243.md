Obituary.  Theodore Frederic Robertson died at his residence Aberdeen 10 June aged 71.  He had lived in the district for 51 years.  He was born in Bristol, England in 1856, the fourth son of the late Dr & Mrs H.A.P. Robertson of St Bartholomew’s Hospital, London.  He came to Australia with a friend, Mr Parker, of the Hoddart Parker Steamship Line on a health trip and their parents hoped they would return and follow the profession of medicine.  Mr Robertson was so taken with Australia that he decided to stay and though he later wanted to visit England, he never managed to get away.  For many years he was clerk for Treleaven & Brown, carriers of Burra whose business he later purchased and carried on successfully to the time of his death.  In business he was noted for his strict integrity.  He was prominent in the Oddfellows Lodge and a member of the Masonic Lodge.  He married Miss H.M. Rogers, second daughter of the late Thomas Rogers of Kooringa.  There are two sons and seven daughters: Fred (Aberdeen), Harry (Woodside), [Laura May] Mrs S. Cilento (Adelaide), Belle Mrs C.W. Muller (Croydon), Gertrude Mrs Thompson (Aldgate), Dorothy Mrs C.W. Ward (Kent Town), Daphne Mrs P.A. Fuss (Aberdeen), Gladys Mrs S.R. King (Aberdeen) & Miss Kathleen.  There are 16 grandchildren and 5 great-grandchildren.
