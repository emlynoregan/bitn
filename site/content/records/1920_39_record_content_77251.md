1st/2nd AIF Volunteers.

Ron Swindon & Arthur Cox were the first of the 2nd AIF volunteers from Burra to be farewelled at the Burra Institute Lodge Room on Thursday last.  Both are in the 6th Division C Company and come from Aberdeen.  They go to NSW and the press says they will go overseas in January.  They were wished well by the Mayor and Dr D.M. Steele whose remarks were supported by H.J.B. Jennison, F.T. Sara, A.L. Bence, M.W. Bednall & A.B. Riggs.

Bill Hann, late of Burra is now a sergeant in the 2nd AIF.
