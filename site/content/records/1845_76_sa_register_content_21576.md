Public Education in 1867.  Editorial.

There are 308 schools under the control of the Board of Education, an increase of 16 on 1866.

Most schools are in the country areas:

Adelaide and corporate towns	39

Country schools proper	231

Outlying or pastoral schools	38

The practice of the Board is to attach a certain amount of stipend to each grade of licence – the grade being determined by personal examination.  Stipends range from £40 to £80.  The average amount of private fees paid in 1866 was £1-1-5½ per scholar.  In Adelaide the average size of school was 69 and so the average income from private fees would be £74 and the average stipend from the Board was £52.

But it varies considerably with districts:

This is surely an anomalous situation. Where the parents can afford to pay more the subsidy is greater!  The largest number in attendance at any time across the colony was 14,544, of whom 8,187 were boys and 6,357 were girls.  Attendance averaged about 78%.  The economic state of the colony is reflected in the number of destitute children:

In 1865 it was 934, in December 1866 it was 1,191 and now it is 1,365.
