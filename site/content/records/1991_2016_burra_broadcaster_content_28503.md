Burra Probus Club sent a busload of people to the Pt Adelaide Museum of Childhood last week. From there the group went to the Tourist Office – formerly the Old Police Station – and then walked along the waterfront to see the One and All and the Failie and also a warship that is being stripped before being sunk off Wirrina Cove as a diving wreck.
