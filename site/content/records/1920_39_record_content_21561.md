Obituary.  Mrs Christina Wilks died at Aberdeen 29 November.  She was born on 25 July at Old Tiers near Adelaide as the third daughter of the late Alexander & Ann Stewart of the White Hart Hotel Aberdeen.  She spent her childhood on Munjibby, Meredy and Tuilkilkey Stations.  The family later took over the White Hart Hotel.  In 1877 she married Mr John Wilks, butcher of Saddleworth and they lived there and at Manoora for seven years before going to make a home at Mt Bryan East.  Mr Wilks died in 1921 and his widow carried on until nine weeks before her death.  She leaves five sons and one daughter: John, Benjamin, William, Ewin & Jenkin & Miss Lily Wilks.  There are 12 grandchildren and Mrs J.G. Terry & Mrs B.A. Preece are sisters.

[Personal note.  My father told me that a grey painted car of 1925 or 1926 model of Mrs Wilks was at Horton Jennison’s in the 1960s on blocks with 7,000 miles on the odometer – possibly a Ford T.]
