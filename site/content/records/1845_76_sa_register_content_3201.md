A certain class of employers, who have benefited from fortuitous prosperity are now availing themselves of their unlimited power and influence to presume upon the preponderance of supply in the labour market to dictate terms to those who have taken themselves to a distant part of the colony on the promise of liberal treatment.

No sooner was the determination of the Burra Directors made known last October, than the miners determined to resist the attempted reduction.  At this moment several hundred of them have made it a point not to bow down to the golden calves, but to remain unemployed, or to seek for other sources of employment.    And they are right.  If they bow down to this reduction, which was decided upon when the employers were making dividends of 200% per quarter, what could they expect except further reductions until they were brought down to the level  of drudgery and starvation from which they hoped they had escaped when they reached our shores?

[The article then recounts the example of a refugee from France who was offered Â£15 per annum and rations by a sheep-farmer, for the services of himself, his wife and a sturdy son.]
