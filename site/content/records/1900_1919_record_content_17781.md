[The adventures of the others become hard to unravel, but the following at least gives a feel of their troubles.]

The remaining riders struggled on contending now with wind, rain and hail.  One made a dash for the light of a farm and ended up with a generous handful of German sausages.  A group of riders made it to the ruins of Midwinter’s old hotel [near where the road leads off to Robertstown] and for a time they sought the shelter of its crumbling walls.  One was missing, but they found him at a fire where he was enjoying some roley pole* that he had extracted from the tucker box of a passing teamster.  Somewhere along the way they acquired a horse and cart to transport a damaged machine.  They finally struggled on to Ford’s slaughterhouse where they were met by the ambulance and eventually got back to Burra.  The cars are reported upon more sketchily, but one of them had difficulties getting to Koomooloo on day one, but finally managed it.  Another gave trouble between Koomooloo and Morgan.  Their adventures in returning in the storm are not recounted, but presumably they made it home eventually.  Everyone is said to have enjoyed themselves despite mechanical difficulties, an overdose of German sausage and the weather.  [* Roly-poly: a strip of suet-crust pastry spread with jam or fruit or sometimes a savoury mixture and rolled up, wrapped in grease-proof paper and steamed or boiled as a pudding.]

‘They say’ that “Barty” is now adjudged an expert of German sausages.
