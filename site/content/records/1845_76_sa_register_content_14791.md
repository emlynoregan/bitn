Kooringa News, 14 August

I have to announce that the men working on the Adelaide road are making some progress.  They are now at the entrance to Kooringa, which was as dangerous a place as anywhere excepting Allendale.  It was stony and full of holes and at journey’s end when the horses are jaded and darkness renders progress more perilous.  I hope they will not stop at the town’s entrance.  Now is the time to continue operations in the main street.  The mud has dried and the work would just have time to set before summer turns it to dust.

The ant-Boothby agitation has lost none of its force and seems to be in everyone’s mouth.  The prevailing opinion seems to be that something certainly out to be done to decide the question and assert out constitutional rights.
