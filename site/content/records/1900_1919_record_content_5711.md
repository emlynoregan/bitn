The work of repairing and enlarging the hall goes on satisfactorily.  Last week the extended wall and roof were finished and anxiety over the western wall and the exposed roof from a westerly gale was ended.  Half the cost has been subscribed and trustees expect a speedy response and hope to finish without increasing the Â£200 debt on the building.
