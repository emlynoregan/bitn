Initial subscriptions totalled £2,000 and after a short time the hospital was proclaimed a public hospital.

In 1915 the Government had contributed £1,496, the public had subscribed £24 and the paying patients had contributed £380.

Of the eight public hospitals in SA the Burra Hospital was the only one that had a contract with the Government in which the latter agreed to make up any shortfall in funds needed for its upkeep.

In 1911 the Board asked that the building be renewed.

The old building had by then had £6,118 spent on it.

The new building cost upwards of £4,000.

Mr Winnall responded.  He said the Government did not in fact make up for any deficiency, but limited its input to £1,500 (dating from c. 12 years ago).  Economies effected by the Board had reduced the subsidy to below that figure.  The average number of patients any year was 276.  The main problem with the building was the number of steps within it.

I.J. Warnes thanked the ladies who had raised about £600 for furnishings – though he admitted that there had been one donation of £250.

[The acknowledged subscriptions so far amounted to £521-15-5 from a report on the same page.]

The new buildings comprise a Men’s Ward, a Women’s Ward and a Surgical Ward.  The Committee has provided 30 beds and mattresses at £6-10-0 each, plus new pillows, bed linen, wire blinds and doors, verandah curtains and railings.
