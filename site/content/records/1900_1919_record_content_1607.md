Burra Town Council.

The Cycling Club has asked to be allowed to give ⅓ of the gate instead of £2-2-0 for their recent meeting.  The request was granted.

The footpath from the National Bank to the Post Office will be tar dressed.

The estimated cost of tar dressing the footpath from Tobin’s Corner to J. Pearce’s in Chapel Street was sought.
