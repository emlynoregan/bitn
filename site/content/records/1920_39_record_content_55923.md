St Mary’s Annual Vestry Meeting

The Rector Rev. D. Redding reported a substantial increase in Sunday collections.  Appreciation was expressed for the work of the wardens, lay readers, organist, choirmaster, choir, Sunday school teachers, servers, sidemen and the ladies who decorate the church, especially Miss Fuss.

[This is likely to be a reference to Miss Doris Fuss.]
