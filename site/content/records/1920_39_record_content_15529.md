Burra Show Society AGM, 23 March

Last year’s show had a profit of £100.  The President I.J. Warnes said that had the members known what lay before them when they voted for a new showground things might have gone differently.  They had a very fine showground, but also an overdraft of almost £1,000.  The ring was fenced and netted, they had a new booth, new sheds, new tie-up posts etc. and some expenses lay ahead.

President’s Report

Mr Walter Morgan a long serving member of the committee died during the year.

The Dog Trials were held on the new ground and were well competed for and well attended.

The Annual Show on 22 October was the first on the new ground and was held in ideal weather.  Both attendance and gate money were records.  There was a very good sheep showing.

This year we will have a two day show.

The railways are building a line to our fence and we will have to do the rest.  The excavation has been hard, but is now complete and we hope all will be ready by show day.

Donations.

Mr Humphrys has collected some £325.  So far the new ground has cost £2,359 of which we have received £1,146 in donations with promises of £81.  After the promises come in the bank overdraft will be £730-16-0.

I wish you to accept from me a further donation of up to £1,000 to give the society a clean start with the railway cutting paid for and leaving the line and platform to do at an estimated £300.

Mr Crewes in seconding the adoption of the report warmly praised Mr Warnes’ generosity.

Mr S.H. Robinson endorsed Mr Crewes’ remarks: ‘he had heard it said that Mr Warnes would give anything so long as he had his own way.  He (the speaker) would like to deny that.  As a matter of fact, the President was just the opposite.  He did not like to do things off his own bat and always consulted his committee.  He was far from running the show on his own.’

Mr Crewes moved that Mr Warnes be elected a life member.  Mr Radford seconded.  Carried with applause.

The railways had contracted to put the line into the ground for £195.

Elections: Patron, C. Bartholomaeus; President, I.J. Warnes; Vice-Presidents, M.A. Radford & S.H. Robinson; Elected Life Members, A.J. McBride, C. Bartholomaeus & J. Melrose.
