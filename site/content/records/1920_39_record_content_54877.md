Porter’s Lagoon is drying up.  In the oldest memories it has always been there and it was for long a hunting ground for wild fowl until closer settlement, since when black swans, sea gulls and water fowl have lived in peace.  In 1926 the Porter’s Lagoon Boat Club was formed and aquatic sports were held every year except for two years until last year when the water was too low.  Years ago it was 16 miles in circumference and 50 years ago Mr Charles Drew of Samuel Drew & Co. kept a boat there for shooting as did other folk.  They were left in the care of Mr Jeffery who lived on the edge of the lagoon.  At present the greatest depth is only six inches and the water is a heavy brine.  Farmers and pastoralists have removes scores of tons of salt for stock use.
