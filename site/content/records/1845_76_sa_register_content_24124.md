Burra Ploughing Match is reported at great length.

Preparations for the match on 22 August were made quickly.  Plenty of prize money was subscribed, a committee was formed and advertising was carried out.  Excursion fares on the railway were arranged.  Despite this the number of competitors in each section was low.  For five prizes there were only nine entrants.  In stock there were also few entries: only three, with no bullocks or cows worthy of mention and no mares.

There were no entries from boys for ploughing or digging.  Nevertheless, attendance at the event was large.  The shops closed at noon and large crowds travelled north to one of the Mining Company’s sections north of the Bon Accord and about two miles from Kooringa.  Every sort of vehicle was pressed into service and other rode or walked.

Mr Bull of the Aberdeen Hotel erected a spacious booth for refreshments and he also arranged a pigeon [shooting] match, climbing a greasy pole and other amusements.  Schraeder’s Band was engaged, though many thought the addition of a loud kettle-drum drowned the music.  W.H. Challoner was President and H. Dawson Chairman of the committee.  Others on the committee were T. Bath, W. Builder, J. Drew, W.H. Williams & A. Motley.  Judges were J.D. Cave, W. Hudson & R. Stevens.
