To discharge his debt to Lock Sing, Lock Won made over his debt to Lock Sing.

This meant Charlie Fie was to pay his debt to Lock Sing.

Mr Snell was engaged to collect 12/- a week from a store in Kooringa until £51 had been paid.

Lock Won called a meeting of his creditors and when Charlie Fie heard this he told Luke Day who was renting the store to stop paying Mr Snell on the pretence that Lock Won had declared himself insolvent.

In letters it had been alleged that Lock Sing was a myth, but he was real enough.  The agreement which could be produced covered everything and Charlie Fie was well acquainted with the facts therein.

Charlie Fie had paid £2-8-0 to Mr Snell under this agreement without demur.

Joe Tie interpreted for Lock Sing.

The agreement allowed all the rent on the shop, dwelling and premises occupied by Luke Day, known as Mr W. Henderson’s and let for 12/- a week, until £51 be paid without interest.  It was signed by I. Lesso and Luke Day as witnesses on 24 January 1894.

It was not signed by Fie which is what the defence counsel worked upon, but Mr Stow said it was quite clear Fie was cognisant of the fact he owed £51 and was perfectly aware he had to settle it by requesting Mr Snell to collect the money from Luke Day.  He found for the plaintiff with full costs.

[This case is one of the few records that disclose the names of a group of Chinese in Burra at the time.  Presumably all the witnesses were local, though the interpreter, Joe Tie, came up from Adelaide according to another case reported in the paper of 20 June 1894.  Those named were Gong Wong, Lock Sing, Ah Fat, Ah Sing, Lee Sue, Charlie Fie, and Lock Won.  We are told Lock Won was known as Lee Won before his marriage and that Lock was his wife’s name.  Charlie Fie is said in the second case to have been renting the garden from Mr Short opposite the Railway Station.  Ah Fat and Ah Sing were, or had been, shopkeepers in Kooringa.

The court appears to have been very patient when hearing the case with all its language difficulties, but the newspaper report is quite racist, making fun of the language difficulties, Chinese names and also ridiculing the swearing process.]
