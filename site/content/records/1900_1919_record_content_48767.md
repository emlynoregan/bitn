Electric Lighting

There have been several approaches about electric lighting, but while the war continues and money markets are difficult we decided to defer any decision.  At present there are 20 acetylene lamps in town and the cost of maintaining them amounts to Â£5-5-0 per lamp and the rates do not allow more lamps without increasing the rate.

Generally the town has made progress with many new and substantial houses erected and roads improved.  The telephone system has been greatly extended.  With peace we can expect much more progress.
