The Eastern Fire Fighting Organisation held its annual meeting at Koomooloo Station last Wednesday.  With the wettest year on record and the country at its best in living memory, the potential for fire is huge.  Forests of spear grass are already drying off.  Unless summer rains come it will be a tinderbox.

Luncheon was served in the shearers’ quarters and the meeting was held in the woolshed.  John McBride was Chairman & Supervisor of the Organisation.  The main visitor was the Director General of the EFS Mr Fred Kerr.  The Chairman’s report stressed the tremendous growth of this exceptional season and its potential to make the east the most fire prone district in the state.  He suggested the need again for the area to be declared a total fire ban area.  He outlined the negotiations which resulted in their having four radio transmitting licences for Single Side Band Receivers on a call sign VL5EM, but at present, while awaiting delivery; they were using the radio on loan from the Traeger Company.  He also reported on his visits to other allied organisations at Mannahill and Gladstone.  The problem of plague locust hatchings was also referred to.  Mr McBride declined to continue in office and Mr Don Lord was elected in his place.  Mr Kerr then gave his address.  Mr Brian Menadue, a police officer, also spoke and said the pilots who flew to Moomba six days a week would be actively looking for fires.
