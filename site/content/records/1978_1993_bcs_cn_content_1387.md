The Public Meeting of Ratepayers called for 26 September resulted in just six people attending plus the Chairman and five of the ten Councillors.  Mrs E.V.M. Tiver writes deploring the apathy displayed.  She believes: ‘…people should not complain if they are too apathetic to attend a meeting which gives an opportunity for ratepayers to express their concerns.’
