Burra Copper Festival

Gala Day

Pt Pirie Marching Girls gave two exhibitions.

The Constellation Model Flying Club gave demonstrations of radio controlled model aircraft.  These planes are values at about $800.  In windy conditions the acrobatic stunts were very impressive.  They travelled at up to 80 m.p.h. down wind.

A parade of Hot Rod vehicles created interest.

Exhibition games by the SA Netball Association Under 16 Country Touring Team were played.

Eight members of the Adelaide Archery Club gave an amazing display of accuracy under testing wind conditions.

Keith Walker and Levi Hughes gave shearing demonstrations.  Tom Rogers provided the sheep.

Boyd Tiver and Graham Day took flights over the town.

The animal nursery featured mothers and babies of various species.  Gordon Webster & John Mitchell had constructed the cages.  [Exhibits and their owners are listed.]

Humphrey B. Bear was well received by a large crowd surrounding the dais, despite being 15 to 20 minutes late on arrival.

The merry-go-round, donkey & pony rides, mini bikes & mini golf were all well patronised.

Refreshment supplies proved adequate.
