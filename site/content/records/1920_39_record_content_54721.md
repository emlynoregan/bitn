The Mongolata Goldfield is 6 miles long and about 120 men are working it, mostly in small groups, all of which are getting gold.  If the Mines Department would test the field there is no reason why more men would not be employed.  The Government battery is presently operating 12 hours a day, but there is no reason it couldn’t be working 24 hours a day.

CWA Ladies organised a Flannel Dance in the Institute on Wednesday 6 February.  The local Harmony Jazz Orchestra supplied the music (Messrs P.L. Rosman, N. Thorpe, A.W. Andrews & F. McGuire).  They wore their new uniforms for the first time: smart double-breasted white Eton coats with black facings and buttons and dark trousers.  As a result of the dance £11 was raised for the CWA Seaside Home Fund.
