World’s End.  An excursionist reports on a trip, taking of the scenery and waterfalls and the pedestrian bridge swung between large trees.  Homesteads in the area are well kept, stock is well looked after and the land well farmed.  Everyone was busy whether attending to the wheat crops or to cows and dairy produce.
