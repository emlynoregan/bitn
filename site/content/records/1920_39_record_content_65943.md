Mrs Ramsay, formerly Susan Davey of Kadina aged 80 on 21 February visited Burra on Tuesday to see her old home town.  Mrs Ramsay’s brother Martin Davey kept the Court House Hotel in the early days [1870-73].  John Dunstan Sen. her uncle kept the White Hart Hotel [1866-69].  She recalled that when she was young she and her cousin Mannie Dunstan used to row up and down the creek in a flat-bottomed boat.  She recalled Mr Jaffery of the Bank of Australasia, Aberdeen, had a fine rowing boat and she went rowing with him on the creek.  She recalls the high roadway from the Mine Store to the Smelts that dammed back the water.  Mrs Ramsay was widowed young with six sons and four daughters.  She had lived in Tiver’s Row.  She said they tied up their boat at the White Hart Ford – how much nicer a name than the younger generation’s “Gully’s Wharf’.
