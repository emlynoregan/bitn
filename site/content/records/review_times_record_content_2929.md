The Redbanks Recreation Study should be given to the Burra Burra DC in the next fortnight.  It will suggest which part of the 25 acre area should be used for the different types of recreation.  Erosion was a problem in the area and it is likely that scrambling and camping would be restricted to certain parts of the area.
