The Eastern Mail left Burra on Friday 12 December and reached its destination at Oakbank Station, 130 miles away.  The return on Sunday morning started as rain began to fall and the run to Morgan Vale was in steady rain – 50 points had been recorded there on arrival.  The driver, W. H. Wahlert made very heavy going on the trip to Pine Valley where 1½” had fallen by his arrival.  Three miles further on he got stuck in a big ‘crab hole’.  The men from the station could not get the car out till Monday morning and he left for the second time c.10 a.m. and this time made 10 miles before again getting bogged and having to walk back for help.  It took five hours and a ‘Spanish Windlass’ to get the car out.  After that the trip on a very sticky track was without further mishap and reached Burra c.11 p.m. Monday – about 30 hours late.
