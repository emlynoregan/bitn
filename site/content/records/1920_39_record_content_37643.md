Visit of Premier Hill & Chief Secretary Whitford

The visitors arrived c. 3.30 p.m. and went to the Council Chamber to meet the Local Unemployment Committee.

The Mayor said there were about 100 breadwinners unemployed, which placed some 250 people on rations.  Business people are facing insolvency and one or two Councillors have had to retire due to financial troubles.  Last year £100 of rates were worked out raising road metal, but this year unemployed men have doubled and the Council has less money than last year.  The Hospital Rate has risen and we are paying for Adelaide Hospital as well through taxation.  The Council has reduced staff and the Town Clerk has taken a voluntary cut.  The town is scattered with miles of road and only 1,800 people.

If the Government made a special grant of say £600 - £ for £ with what the Council pays in wages for 60 men at £10 a piece for six months it would amount to about 30/- a month per man, but would be a great help.  The subsidy on rates has been cut from £268 to c. £64 and the main road grant halved.

Cr Allen supported the Mayor.

Cr McWaters for the District Council said at one time the District Council had £1,300 main road grant, but now it had reduced such that good roads were drifting into a bad condition.  The ration system was unsatisfactory.  There should be some production from its cost of £15-20,000 a week.  The Council had £300 to £400 to maintain 27 miles of main road, which was a flea bite to what was really required.  Two bridges on the Eudunda Road needed urgent repair lest there be accidents.  He thought men could be put to work developing some of the mallee lands.  He sought a grant of £400.

Cr Bevan said with winter coming it would be a desperate time with many in dire need of clothing.  At Mongolata 43 men were working, but were greatly hampered by a lack of water and the cost of motor taxation.  The Minister of Mines had lent some tools for which they were grateful.

Mr Sara said the merchants were most unfortunate, bearing the brunt of it.  The unemployed had managed for 12 months, but now their clothes were vanishing with no means of replacing them.  In Burra there was more unemployment than in most towns, though not because the men were less industrious.  Here there were about 300 people on rations and in Clare only about 15.

‘The reason, it appeared to him, was that this being an old mining town there were lots of old cottages in it the rent of which was very low and people had come her to take advantage of that.’  He thought this should entitle the Council to special consideration.

The Mayor handed over a list of between 200 & 300 people on rations including women and children.  He said that the beneficence of the late John Lewis had set aside Paxton Square cottages at 1/- a week whilst in Jamestown he had to pay 15/- a week for a garage in which to keep his car.

Mr McHugh endorsed what had been said about cheap housing.  Another reason for high unemployment was that being on the edge of pastoral areas there were shearers and wood-cutters etc. peculiar to the town.

Mr Hill said unfortunately the difficulties of Burra were exactly similar to those facing the whole state and went on to speak of Government deficits, the drop in market values and the need then to increase taxation.  He would be pleased to grant the £600 asked for by the Town Council and the £400 asked by the DC, BUT. . .

The quarterly registration of motor cars would be a huge loss.

Mr Sara – What would it be if one third were not registered?

Mr Hill thought the tide was turning.

Dinner was then taken in Mr J. Allen’s rooms.

The toasts and accompanying speeches are reported.

Mr McHugh said his father had worked in the Burra Mine 60 years before.

Chief Secretary Whitford said he was ‘the son of a pioneer who camped in huts over 75 years ago’.
