Burra High school Jubilee Celebrations

During the party Mr Jennison hoped Mrs Draysey would enjoy her brief return to Burra and a variety of other people spoke.  Former Headmaster Mr Biddle said that 46 years ago there had been one teacher and one room, making it difficult to keep all classes going smoothly.  Transport difficulties made it hard to increase roll numbers, though a few like Cliff Flower and Fred Schultz came in on horseback.  Others who spoke included Barbara Hogan (Head Prefect), Hedley Pearce, Murray Scriven and Mr A. Bartholomaeus, who was number 1on the High School roll.  Mrs M. Kellock moved a vote of thanks on behalf of the Parents & Friends Association.  The Burra Town Hall was filled to capacity on Thursday night for the concert [for which items are listed.]

On Friday morning there was a basketball match in which Old Scholars 18 defeated Present Scholars 17.  [Best players are cited.]  In the afternoon the football game resulted in a victory for Old Scholars 11.14 to Present Scholars 7.6. [Teams are listed.]

On Friday night the Town Hall was again filled to capacity for the annual ball.  Door takings exceeded Â£160.

Two Photographs are printed.
