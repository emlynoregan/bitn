Here the storm burst and little of what the speaker said could be heard.  He was heard to say that he had the names of 100 miners opposed to the fund.

He was called upon to name some and he named a miner recently dead.  ‘A living witness.’ Was called for as the tumult increased.

Dr Bull rushed to the top of the table and at the top of his voice said to Mr Kingston, ‘I say it is robbery; I say it is a swindle.’

Mr Kingston immediately retorted ‘You are a liar.’

This brought the meeting to an abrupt conclusion.  Mr Mortlock vacated the chair.  Dr Bull disappeared amidst the angry crowd and Mr Kingston retired with his friends, his supporters greeting him with hearty cheers.
