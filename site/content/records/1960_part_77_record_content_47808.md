Burra Tennis Association held its AGM in Booborowie Hall 15 September.

President D. Jones said he regretted that Hallett would not be fielding any teams this season.  There will be seven ‘A’ Grade teams, with Spalding fielding two.  Eight teams would contest the ‘B’ Grade and there would be seven ‘C’ Grade (Junior) teams.  The President reported a successful year financially because of a $104 profit from the Association Ball, which helped them to a credit of $58 for the year.  In ‘A’ Grade Mt Bryan were undefeated to win their second successive premiership.  In ‘B’ Grade the two Spalding teams dominated.  Junior teams remain strong and Mt Bryan won for the third year in succession.  At the successful ball Miss Jenny Kleinig of Leighton was Miss Tennis for 1968-69. He noted the regrettable death of Mr Lux Matters, who gave many years of dedicated service to tennis as a player and administrator.  [Lancelot Luxford Swann Matters born 5 April 1908, Adelaide: died 21 April 1969 Adelaide, residence Spalding.]
