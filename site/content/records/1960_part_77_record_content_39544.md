Burra Hospital.  The new operating theatre became ready for use yesterday.  The equipment is fully up-to-date and the new radium theatre light, counterbalanced and moveable in any direction, comes directly from Germany and is the latest in design. The theatre is air conditioned and has anti-static floors and X-ray viewers for on the spot checks.  Gasses are automatically fed and water in the scrub-up room is pre-heated and sterilised by ultra-violet light.  The automatic back-up power and light system adds to the efficiency.  Work on clearing the old theatre block has commenced in preparation for renovations to produce an all purpose lounge, lecture, sewing and Board room.  The remaining section of the building will be converted into domestic quartes for live-in staff where necessary.
