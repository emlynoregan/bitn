The Burra Motor Co. has changed hands.

Dollman’s Burra Motor Co. has been operated by three generations of the Dollman family and the new owners are Neil & Angie and David & Libby Webster.  Guy Dollman Snr came to Burra with his family from Wilcannia in 1923 and established the Burra Motor Co. alongside the Commercial Hotel.  He moved to the present site in the late 1930s.  Originally the present site had an ice works and Luke Day, a Chinese storekeeper and greengrocer had his shop on the corner.  The Burra Motor Co. was a thriving business with 15 employees at one time and was an independent petrol retailer, selling brands such as Caltex, Golden Fleece, Neptune, Shell, Vaccuum and Ampol.  John Nankivell can recall the old hand-pumped petrol bowsers, where a certain volume was pumped into a large glass measure on top of the bowser and was then gravity fed into the cars.  John worked there for some 22 years, starting in 1948 and the late Jeff Neale also worked there for many years.  Dollmans had the franchise for Vanguard cars and also for Hillman, Dodge and Chrysler at different times.  Jim Richards started work there in 1950 and worked for Dollmans for 13 years, ten as foreman.  Guy Dollman Snr died in 1967 and Guy Jnr and his wife Dawn then ran the business.  Guy Jnr died in 1993, after which his son Richard continued in partnership with his mother.

The interior was modernised in 1993 at the suggestion of Connie Hallion.

It is believed there have been two fires on the site over the last 75 years – one when Luke Day was there.*

Richard Dollman also recalls that when floodwaters swept down Commercial Street they had either to sandbag the premises or sweep water out of it.  [3 photos.]

[*There is a report of a fire in Luke Day’s shop in the Burra Record of 30 September 1914, page 3, which seems to have been a fairly minor event.  The fire in Wright’s Motors is reported in the Burra Record of 19 November 1930, page 3 and was a much more serious affair.]
