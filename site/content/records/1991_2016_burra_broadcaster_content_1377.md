Free Rock Music Workshops will be offered at Burra in the last weekend in May.  They will feature Adelaide Band ‘Billy and the Redfins’ and two Mid North-based musicians, Frank Zaknich of Clare (drummer) and Elizabeth Robertson of Leighton (vocalist).  This is an initiative of the Burra Arts Council, funded by the Northern Country Arts Board and Centre State Youth Strategy.  As well as instrumental sessions there will be a financial management workshop with entertainment industry accountant Mark Kraus (the Redfins’ saxophonist) and also sessions on original composition and arrangement.

There will be a rock concert-cum cabaret in Burra Town Hall on Saturday 29 May.  The target group for the workshops is aged 15-18, but older persons may also participate.

[The article continues with information about the band and other musicians involved in the workshops.]
