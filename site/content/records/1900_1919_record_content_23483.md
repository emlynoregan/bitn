Court.

The committal of W. Voumard is presented in detail extending to just over 1 column.  The accused was under 20 and his forgery was witnessed by Alex Degenhardt, aged 20, who told the whole story to the court.  Voumard’s counsel contended that Degenhardt had actually told Voumard how to go about it and had made 10/- from the transaction.
