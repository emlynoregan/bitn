21 November

The English & Australian Copper Co. appealed against their town assessment.  Mr Gall appeared for the appellants and F.J. Packard for the Council.  Mr Packard objected that the property was not identified by the appellants because the lot numbers used appeared in more than one ward.  Mr Sinclair ruled that nevertheless their identity was not really in doubt and he was more concerned over the omission of the word ‘rateable’.  Mr Gall said the property must be rateable to be assessed.

The E. & A. Copper Co. wanted the assessment of a property in East Ward reduced from £24 and the Council agreed to £22, but Mr Killicoat for the E. & A. Copper Co. said its real value was c. £19.  He said repairs to it had averaged £3-18-6 p.a. for the last five years.  Mr Packard said its annual rental was £27 and that made the assessment fair.  Eventually the assessment was reduced to £18.

The SM then said that if the other cases were on a par with that a conference between counsels was advisable and accordingly he adjourned the court.  An agreement was then made to reduce the following assessments:

No. 53 in North Ward from £5 to £2-10-0

No. 57 in North Ward from £20 to £15

No. 58 in North Ward from £3 to £1

No. 3 in East Ward from £22 to £18

No. 4 in East Ward from £22 to £18

No. 5 in East Ward from £5 to £3

No. 7 in East Ward from £10 to £5

[The significance of this case lay in the general decline of property values in the town and the consequent need for a new assessment to avoid a flood of appeals in the following year.]
