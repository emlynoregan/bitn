The chairman favoured holding a meeting.  The secretary said they had £60 in hand and a possible £100 could be obtained from the Betting Control Board and £70 from subscriptions.  Mr Bowles favoured a picnic meeting with profits to patriotic causes.  Mr Scovel suggested half the profits.  The chairman said they could not afford to run a meeting at a loss and as they held two meetings a year, how were profits on one meeting to be calculated when subscriptions covered two.  It was resolved that the profits as arrived at by the committee be devoted to patriotic causes. A. Tennant was re-elected President.  Mr Bednall resigned as Chairman for business reasons.
