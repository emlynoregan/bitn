Redruth Reformatory.  A letter signed by:

S.J. Bloyd, late Rector of St Mary’s

D.B. Bridgwood, late Minister of the Redruth Methodist Circuit

A.J. Finch, late Minister of the Kooringa Methodist Circuit

G.K. Haslam, Minister of the Kooringa Methodist Circuit

Eric M. Ingamells, Minister of the Redruth Methodist Circuit

H.H. Hopton, Rector of St Mary’s

It expresses amazement that the Matron of the Burra Girls’ Reformatory has been asked to resign.  They comment on the wonderful improvement in conditions and the general deportment of the girls and the highest moral influence brought to bear on their lives and feel that the move is a grave injustice.
