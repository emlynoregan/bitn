The Burra Cycling Classic was run last Saturday.  The race was first run between Burra and Adelaide in 1907, but since the advent of traffic lights they can no longer finish in the city.  This year’s event started at the Burra Town Hall and competitors then rode to Mt Bryan, back to Burra and then to Gawler via Saddleworth, Marrabel, Kapunda and Greenock.  35 started from Burra.  In a close finish at Gawler Dave Rootes won by two inches from Ken Watts and Doug Kaesler was a further six inches back.  The fastest was Barry Datson off scratch in 4 hours 19 minutes 26 seconds.

This year’s race held unusual local interest.  Doug Holly, who had the second fastest time, is Shirley Thamm’s brother.  J. Hall, who finished 9th, is a brother to Peter Hall and Ken Watts, who finished 2nd overall, is a former Burra policeman.
