Local Exhibitions.

The Annual Antique & Decorating Fair was held at Burra Town Hall.

Burra Arts Councilâ€™s 2nd Art Exhibition had works from 18 artists, including 10 from Burra and drew more than 600 visitors in the first weekend in May.

Burra Arts Council and the Burra Burra DC put in a submission for funding to refurbish the former Post & Telegraph Office as a Regional Art Gallery.

Terowie established a Pioneer Gallery with more than 1,000 photographs.

The Burra Show Society is trying to boost the number of exhibitors.
