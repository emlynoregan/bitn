Burra Town Council, 8 June

A letter from the Minister of Local Government asking for suggestions for post war development projects will lie on the table for the time being.

The Minister of War Organisation says the reduction to one market day a month was a voluntary act of the Stock & Station Agents & the Livestock Salesmenâ€™s Assoc.

Lieut. Courtenay of HMAS Burra-Bra wrote suggesting the wording for the plaque for the ship.  He also no comforts had yet been received from Burra people.  The Mayor will call a meeting to organise money for a wireless.

Mr Richards, Leader of the Opposition, said on his recent visit that he had interviewed the Minister of Defence concerning a munition annex for Burra.  He was told a representative had not interviewed people in Burra or asked to be shown the buildings like the bulk store near the Bon Accord Bridge, or the empty garages.  Mr Making will be written to concerning what had taken place.
