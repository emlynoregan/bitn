A History of Seven Mid-Northern Hundreds

The publishing committee of the Terowie Branch of the CWA advises its publication Deceptive Lands: a History of Seven Mid-Northern Hundreds, will be released before Christmas at a cost of $5.  The Author is Roma Mattey (now Mrs Hans Schultz).  It is an attempt to cover the early pastoral history of the Hundreds of Terowie, Whyte Yarcowie, Wonna, Gumbowie, Ketchowla, Yongala and Parnaroo.

All surveyed towns in the area except Peterborough have been described and there are many historic photographs in the book of over 250 pages.  The foreword is by His Excellency W.R. Crocker, now Australian Ambassador in Rome.  He spent his early childhood at Parnaroo.
