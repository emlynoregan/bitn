Lionel Oppermann was caught trying to cross the White Hart ford by Gullyâ€™s house when a sudden wave of water washed the horses round one post of the footbridge and the lorry round another.  Oppermann tried to save the horses.  He managed at considerable risk to cut the harness and both horses eventually clambered out of the water.  The lorry ended up in the creek opposite Walker & Sons Aberdeen shop, where it was secured by ropes.  The footbridge was soon after swept away.
