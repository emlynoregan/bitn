Review of 1999

The summer of 1998-99 was quite hot and very dry.  There were no major bushfires, but there were three house fires.

Major Events of 1999:

Citizen of the Year was Pauline Venning.

Event of the Year was the 120.20 Burra Community School Concert.

Jailhouse Rock in February was a success – attended by c. 300.

The Twilight Jazz Affair at ‘Petherton’, Hallett was enjoyed by many.

The Antique Fair has become firmly established and attracted quite a few hundred people.

‘Burra Breakaway’ saw CWA members from across SA converge on Burra.

Telstra’s Digital Phone Tower was the culmination of a long saga and since it was commissioned CDMA has been added to its services.

May saw the visit of the Grand Bard of Cornwall.

A $70,000 project at Burra Oval saw the new netball & tennis courts installed with a new lighting system.

The greening of the Burra Golf Course was an even bigger project and the new course was opened in May.

Thorogood’s Cider Cellar made its debut.

The 1999 Burra Show went off well.

A diving school was established at the Mine Pool.

Mt Isa Mines (MIM) spent some time carrying out a geophysical survey just to the north of Burra.

Elspeth Radford was invited to join the Women’s Regional Advisory Committee in Canberra.

Chris Parker graduated from Course 5 of the Australian Rural Leadership Program.

On 8 December a severe [hail] storm hit Burra inflicting much damage on the town and district.
