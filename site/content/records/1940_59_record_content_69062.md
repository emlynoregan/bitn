M.W. Bednall (as Director) writes to clarify the position of the Burra Electric Supply Company Ltd.

The company was established by means of money supplied by the people of Burra and almost all shares are still held by people with Burra interests.

The directors of any company are bound to protect the interests of their shareholders and would be failing in that if they sacrificed the company’s assets.

Despite any other statements, including the letter from the Hon. Sir Lyell McEwin, the Directors have not made an offer to the Trust, nor have they yet met to consider an offer from the Trust.

The Directors have good reason to believe that even if the Trust took over, the cost to consumers would at least equal if not exceed the amount charged by the company.

If the Trust took over, the present employees would not be required in Burra and a substantial amount of money now spent by the company would be lost to the town.

The shareholders have lost an appreciable amount of money already by sacrificing dividends to plant and line improvements and they should at least get back the value of their undertaking.

“Ratepayer’s” complete disregard for other people’s rights is to be deplored.

‘Knocked Back.’  Burra has knocked back the river water and now electric power.  Should the Mayor start a petition to take over this very necessary and at present unsatisfactory public utility, he would find 90% of the ratepayers willing to support it.  Could the present company supply power for the appliances as requested to the officials of the Trust?  It is time a realistic view of the matter was taken and Burra ratepayers given the services they rightly deserve.
