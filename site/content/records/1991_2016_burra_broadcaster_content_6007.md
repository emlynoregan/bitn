Terowie

A sequel to the highly successful I Remember is presently being printed by Burra Community Print for the Terowie Citizens Association and author-collator Marina Gray.  It celebrates Terowie in the 1940s when it was a mass of trains and troops.  Terowie will be busy at the weekend for the 50th anniversary of VE Day marking the finish of the war in the Pacific on 8 May 1945.

[VE Day on 8 May 1945 marked Victory in Europe, following Germanyâ€™s surrender the previous day.  VP Day (sometimes referred to as VJ Day), marking Victory in the Pacific was on 15 August 1945.]
