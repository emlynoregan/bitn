Editorial on The Question of Races.

[The editor is responding to criticism of himself in the Port Adelaide News, which apparently considered that the Record, usually having sound views, had gone ‘so much astray’ in its comments on the homestead issue.]

But where have we gone astray?  We utterly deny this imputation.

[The editor then goes off in characteristically flowery fashion and cites the lost tribe of Benjamin and the Rape of the Sabines as examples of contamination of the racial stock.  He goes on to say that in the last 50 years all moral considerations have been given over in favour of powerful commercial interests.]

Every consideration of the Chinese has been founded upon the grossest and lowest principles - the mere and sheer principle of lucre.

‘They may pollute poor European families, and European society as they do, by obtaining wives by abduction, seduction and secret barter (we write again advisedly) and not a word is said; not a complaint made, by European father, mother or brother.’

‘But let the Chinaman (which includes here all coloured races) be considered in relation to capital and labour, to certain trades and occupations, to the lowering of European wages, then the modern colonial philanthropist is deeply wounded.  Wipe out, smother, pollute, corrupt his morals, and he is meekly content; but let the Chinaman or the Oriental influence of his wages, and reach for his pocket, and he roars out with genuine agony like a bull of Bashan!  Absit omen.’

The meeting at Pt Adelaide was in the interests of the pocket: not social or moral interests.
