Obituary.  R.J.M. McBride died at his residence on 13 October after a very brief illness of three days: a cold turned to pneumonia.  He was born at Newry, Northern Ireland, 13 January 1831 and went to sea at the age of 14.  In seven years as a sailor he visited most parts of the world and doubled the Horn twice.  He arrived in Australia in 1852 and tried his luck at the Victorian goldfields.  Soon he returned to the sea and came to SA four years later with only 5/- in his pocket.  He came to Burra and became a miner and afterwards a carrier between Adelaide and Burra, before becoming a fencing contractor for sheep stations.  In 1859 he became a squatter, establishing ‘The Gums’.  Over the years he has owned Pine Valley, Drayton, Teetulpa, Faraway Hill, Finger Post, Oakleigh, Redcliffe, Outalpa and Oulnina.  He has also been keenly interested in mining.  He invested in 100 £10 shares of Broken Hill Pty, some of which he later sold for £14,000 each.  He first married Miss Bessie Dunn who came to SA on a ship in which he was a sailor.  She died 18 June 1902 and he later married Mrs Robinson of Broken Hill.  The surviving family are: William (Aberdeen, pastoralist), Robert Martin (Toorak, pastoralist), Albert James (Glen Osmond, pastoralist), Thomas (Torrensville, pastoralist), Norman Harold (Glenelg, pastoralist), Caroline Sandland (Kooringa), Mrs Isabella Hawkes (Koonoona), Mrs Mary Keynes (Leighton), Mrs Jane Boehme (Ucolta) and Mrs Alice Evans (St Peters).  There are 56 grandchildren and 28 great-grandchildren.

Since 1912 he has given away over £57,000 to charitable and patriotic war funds including:
