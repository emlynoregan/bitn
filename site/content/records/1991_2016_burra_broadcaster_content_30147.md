While the weather is dry Council is looking to clean up the creek banks, get a hydrologist’s report on how to seal the bed of the pond and how to reduce the annual $20,000 cost of pumping bore water into the creek.

Sealing Harry’s Lane behind the Hardware shop and the Commercial Hotel is to be completed in the first half of 2003.

Council is replacing white cedar trees, many of which are rotting and/or splitting.

Aleppo pines are also becoming a problem and they could soon be declared noxious.
