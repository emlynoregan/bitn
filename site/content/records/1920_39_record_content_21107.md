Burra Show on 26 & 27 October was a great success.  The weather was perfect.  Someone estimated there were 1,200 cars, but we don’t know.  On the big second day takings were 20% up on 1925 and it is thought some 2,000 people passed through the gates on members’ tickets and that the total attendance must have been between 7,000 & 8,000 and it was a remarkably prosperous and well-dressed crowd.  There was a real street of sideshows.  The view from the cars on the hill was superb.  The official luncheon catered for about 100 guests including three Members of the Legislative Council: Hon. W. Morrow, Hon. P.B. Blesing & Hon. G. Ritchie and the members for the district: Messrs M.R. O’Halloran MP, A.R.G. Hawkes MP & S. McHugh MP.

The President I.J. Warnes in his speech extolling the expansion of the show said a sheep pavilion was needed and he would give £250 towards it if members would contribute £ for £.  The Pavilion, though doubled in size from its original, was now quite full.  Agricultural produce reflected the good season.  Dairy produce was of high quality.  Eddie Finch in particular had an excellent display.  Mrs Dan Williams of Ironmine won a separator presented by SA Farmers’ Union.  K.B. Watts dominated the meat awards.  Poultry accommodation had been improved, but entries had fallen this year by about 60.  The quality of entries was excellent.  There was little competition in Draught & Blood Horses, but quality was high.  There were excellent entries in Horses in Action.  Cattle entries were not numerous, but were of good quality.  Competition in Dogs was keen.  Sheep were the strongest section in the show and exhibits again increased being up 50 [from last year’s 121] and small producers were well represented.  Fleece wool was not well represented with only 7 entries.  The implement display was improved.  Vegetables were of good quality and well displayed.  R.E. Hunter of Clare took all but one of the awards for fresh and dried fruit.  The flowers were of good quality, but the judge thought the staging could be improved with a lack of colour blending and careless placing of exhibits.  Cooking was well represented as were Arts and Industries.  The School Class was very creditable, especially the smaller schools of Leighton & Copperhouse and the new school at Ayers which got 10 awards from 14 entries.
