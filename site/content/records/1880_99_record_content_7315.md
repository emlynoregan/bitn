Burra Town Council, 3 July

The Mayor reported that he had waited with the ex-Mayor on Sir Henry Ayers to ask that not all springs at Diprose Creek be sold, but some be reserved for the benefit of the public.  They were favourably received.

The Government advised that there were no funds to make the road between the passenger and goods gates at the station.

There was a long discussion re the Market Square lamp and it was finally resolved that the dayman would trim it in Corporation time and light it in his own time.
