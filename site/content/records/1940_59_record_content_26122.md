Hon. Norman Makin, Minister elect for Washington and A.E. Smith MHR spoke at the Burra Town Hall on Friday night.

The Mayor had previously extended a Civic Welcome to Mr Makin and Mr Smith and introduced them to the audience.  Mr G.H. Dollman welcomed them on behalf of the Association.

Mr Smith said he was anxious to see that the men got a fair deal.  The war had ended more rapidly than he had expected and the transition to peace was hard.  Only a small proportion of demobilised men were unemployed and in some of those cases they did not know what they wanted to do.  During the war some had earned up to £10 or £12 a week and now in civilian life were faced with low wages or distasteful jobs and were consequently unsettled.  Some men were calling for homes and a Land Settlement Scheme and the Government was working towards that.  Land Settlement could not be hurried because it involved both the State and federal Governments.

Mr M.T. Fuller thanked the speaker on behalf of the RSL.

Mr Makin said Australia’s war effort was comparable with any of the allies and the country had been united behind the gigantic effort required.  It had taken three years to reach full war-time production with all the man and woman power that zeal could muster.  How much longer was it going to take to readjust to peace with no such patriotic motive behind the effort?  Other countries were facing the same problems.  Rehabilitation of returned personnel was the main theme.  He said that his appointment as Australia’s representative at the United Nations had come as a complete surprise.  The UN was offering an opportunity for nations to cement an everlasting peace.  He said Britain’s food ration was more austere now than in the war because they had given some of their food to the starving people on the Continent.  Australians had hardly gone without anything during the war and should be more appreciative of the gifts that God had bestowed in plenty.

[There were then questions about large landowners and a debate about whether Mr Hawker was entitled to ask a question as a non-member.  Eventually he was permitted to, as it was a public meeting.

His question related to the slowness in getting land into the Land settlement process.

Mr Bence wanted hostels in the city for men wishing to learn a trade.

Mr Makin said that at present housing was the priority.

There were other questions relating to available help to set up a business.]
