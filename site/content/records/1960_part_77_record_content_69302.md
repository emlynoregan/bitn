Burra Burra DC

The lighting of fires has been banned in the Hundreds of Mongolata, Baldina, Rees and King from now till 31 March 1974 and for the rest of the district from 29 November to 15 February 1974.

Council is considering closing down the pictures due to the bad behaviour of some young patrons.  Vandalism is also a concern.

A Government grant has been approved through the Highways Department for the sealing of the Station Road.

Council is supporting plans by the Golf Club to erect a new clubhouse.

Council is considering an application by the ‘Melbourne Cup Party’ for better access to the Town Hall Supper Room.  The access from Mt Pleasant Road is very steep, slippery and awkward.

The common effluent scheme for Burra is getting closer for those who intends hooking up to the system.  Plans are being prepared by an Adelaide firm and are expected to arrive in February or March.

New Plant: Council last week took delivery of a new D6C worth $40,814 and a Cat 12 E Grader at $33,000 (less the trade-in on three second hand units.
