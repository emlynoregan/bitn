Pt Adelaide Court, 29 November.

Martha Gully, alias Vera Gilbert, pleaded not guilty to obtaining by false pretences a hat valued at 13/6, the property of Archibald James McGregor.

The defendant obtained two hats on approval she said for Mrs Gyss.  One was later returned.  The defendant was employed by Mrs Gyss, who gave no instructions to buy hats.  The defendant left her without notice.  The accused wore the hat back to Adelaide when arrested.  She elected to be tried at the Supreme Court and was released on Â£25 bail.  She was also charged with stealing a handbag worth 15/6, the property of Adelaide Gyss.
