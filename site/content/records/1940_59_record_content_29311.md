‘The Man Who Sees’ writes again, this time urging the complete demolition of all sub-standard dwellings in Burra and their replacement with suitable dwellings to meet people’s needs at an economical rent.  This would also meet the needs of the unemployed.  All roads and footpaths should be made dustproof.  Tree planting should follow with an island garden with seats in the Square and a women’s rest room.
