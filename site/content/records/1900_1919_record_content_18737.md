‘They Say’

Poor old Charley Cucumber [Heinrich] is leaving Burra and good old ‘out-back’ will take control of the Burra Hotel directly.

Sir Frederick beat Mr Vaughan by 2 to 1 on Wednesday.

We are to have a Lord as Boniface of the Burra Hotel.

W. Barkley writes about early closing.  He says it is incorrect to say that storekeepers have been in the habit of closing at 9 p.m. on Saturday.  Only drapers have done so and their carts continue to run about delivering goods, which is just as bad.  It is impossible for fruiterers to close promptly at 9 and is it fair to ask a man to close at 9 when 9-10 is his busiest time during the summer months? As for 8 hours, most chop assistants work a 9½ hour day.  I do not wish to take away privileges and always pay overtime.  As for Saturday night not paying for the kerosene, he must have asked that question on a very cold, wet winter’s night.  [Fruiterers probably got a late delivery by train on Saturdays.]
