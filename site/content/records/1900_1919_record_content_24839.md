Hanson Railway Station

Closer settlement on Braefoot and Shafton has increased traffic at Hanson and the accommodation has grown cramped.  It was recently decided to build a new station and office etc.  The work has now started and an effort is being made to get the department to extend the length of the platform a little as part of the work.
