Salvation Army Annual Meeting at the Institute on Wednesday was presided over by Dr Sangster.  Rev. W.H. Rofe (Wesleyan), Rev. J.Y. Simpson (Wesleyan), Ensign Verity, Captain Griffiths and Sister Ward were on the platform.

Dr Sangster spoke of the good work of the Army and of the need for the young to be careful in their dealings and for parents to talk to their children about their dangers and responsibilities.  [All put very delicately.]  Rev. Rofe also spoke in support of the Salvation Army’s efforts.  He spoke against parents who prevented their children from attending Sunday school and told cautionary tales about drunkenness and gambling.

Ensign Verity devoted his address to the social programs of the Army.  Rev. Simpson moved a vote of thanks which was seconded by A. Harris Sen.  As a result of the meeting the local corps has been able to send £13 to headquarters.
