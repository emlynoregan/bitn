Obituary.  Mr A.G. (Tom) Heinrich died 23 April.  He was a well-known farmer and grazier.  He died at Ru Rua Hospital in North Adelaide aged 73.  He was born 16 October 1890 at the Heinrich Homestead of Dutton’s Trough.  He received his early education at World’s End Creek School and later attended Point Pass College for UNREADABLE and was confirmed at Immanuel Lutheran Church, Point Pass by the late Pastor G.T. UNREADABLE.  Having spent all his life on the family homestead, Mr Heinrich took over the property from his parents.  In 1930 he married Miss Melva Riesson who died in 1934.  On 24 June 1937 he married Miss Rosa Wittwer at St Peter’s church, Point Pass.  They had seven children.  In his youth he played cricket for World’s End and football for Apoinga, but his great love was rifle shooting and he took an active interest in the Burra Rifle Club, winning many trophies, including Club champion and the Baldina Trophy for yearly aggregate as recently as 1955.  He represented Burra with other members in the big shoots in Sydney in the late 1930s.  He was a foundation member of the Burra Small Bore Club and active in the early years of its existence.   He served a term as Chairman of the Burra Primary School Committee.  He is survived by his wife and children: Cynthia, Annette Mrs Paul Sabel (of Hope Vale Lutheran Mission in Queensland), Graham, Maxine, Delrose, Kathlynn and Stephney.  The funeral cortege of more than 100 cars attended the funeral at St Peter’s Cemetery, Point Pass.
