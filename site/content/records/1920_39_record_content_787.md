Burra Cheer-up Soc. Final General Meeting.  Methodist Lecture Hall on Wednesday last.

Vice-President John Drew took the chair.  Also present were Mrs E.C. Bertram (President of the Soldiers’ Aid Soc.) and S.M. Lane (Vice-President of the Burra Branch of the RSL).

The AGM had been due in May 1919, but with soldiers arriving home continuously it had been postponed.  The society’s work was now over after almost five years.  After tonight the Executive Committee would continue on to control the money in hand in the Cheer-up Wounded Soldiers’ Fund.  This would be devoted to any returned soldier needing assistance in the future.  £285 had already been distributed to some of the badly wounded or disabled soldiers of Burra and District.  The postponed meeting meant that two reports would be read.  The last act of the society as a whole would be to help in a fair in aid of the Blind Institute later in the year.  The society’s Union Jack was handed over to the RSL.  Votes of thanks were accorded to all who took part and especially to E.W. Crewes (President), J. Drew (Vice-President), Miss B.E. (Trix) Pearce (Secretary), Ethel James (Assistant Secretary), Frank Harris (Treasurer), James Bentley (Bandmaster), John Pearce (for use of the Cheer-up room) and E.J. Harris (for use of crockery).
