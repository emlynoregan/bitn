Boer War.  The relief of Mafeking was celebrated with a mock ‘attack’ on the town by some 500 children who assembled at the Public School and then marched on the town centre and thence to the hospital where they sang God Save the Queen and gave three cheers for Baden-Powell.  Hey marched back to the Square where they again sang the National Anthem and cheered Baden-Powell.  Then news of strangers at Victoria Park seemed to threaten the supply of saveloys and rolls which had been provided for the troops.  The strains of the Boys’ Brigade Drum and Fife Band urged the troops to go forth and attack their eatables.  At Victoria Park it was found advisable to fire blank volleys to give the enemies a chance to escape, but all there carried white flags and the almost inexhaustible supply of lollies and apples together with the saveloys and rolls were enough to satisfy the appetites of all.  Sports followed with cash prizes.  The procession was headed by a large banner painted by Mr E. Jones, featuring a lion in a chariot drawn by two kangaroos and in front Kruger on a boar with the inscription: ‘They’re after me’.   While the children’s demonstration went on some older residents placed an effigy of Kruger in a coach drawn by four horses and he was taken around town during the day while patriotic songs were sung by several young men.  In the evening a large demonstration was held and the principal streets were paraded.  In the evening ‘Kruger’ was held up to ridicule, tried by a jury, and condemned to death.  A gallows was erected behind the Commercial Hotel and the sheriff demanded the body of ‘Oum Paul’.  He was promptly despatched and after a time cut down and committed to the flames while a crowd sang Soldiers of the Queen etc.  Despite the enthusiasm the whole thing went off in a disciplined way and was a credit to all who took part.  Respectable residents, who rarely visit the streets, put in an appearance to witness the proceedings and show their loyalty to the Queen.

[William Pearce brought scorn and derision on his head when at the Literary Soc. meeting he used the word ‘Rabble’ to describe those attending the burning of Kruger in effigy.  This was so unpatriotic that he had to write to the Record to explain that he had not intended this to apply to all those present, but only to a certain segment.  He had, he said, ‘put his signature to the requisition presented to the Council and otherwise helped in a small way.’]
