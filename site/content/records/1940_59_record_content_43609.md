A Housing Trust Committee was formed in Burra at a meeting on 28 November for those interested in the erection of new housing in Burra.  Mr Hastings in his recent visit here had suggested the formation of a committee.  Town Clerk Mr E.R. Davey said that if things were moved quickly occupation could be expected in about 9 months.  Costs were expected to be c. £1,475 and repayments of interest and capital 27/6 a week or more depending on the number of years for the loan.  The deposit was c. £80 for ex-servicemen and £300 for others.  Three plans were available.  The site selected was a piece of ground belonging to Mr M. Pritchard near Victoria Park.  It was decided to form a committee comprising the Town Council and one representative from each of the RSL, the Fathers’ Assoc., the Air Force Assoc. etc.  E.R. Davey as Secretary has forwarded ten names of persons desiring to obtain one of the houses.
