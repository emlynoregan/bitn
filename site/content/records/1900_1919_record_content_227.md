Obituary.  Mr Thomas Andrews, 3rd son of Mrs R. Andrews [and, according to the paper of 24 Jan. 1900, page 2, of the late Richard Andrews], was thrown from his horse and dislocated his neck.  Death was instantaneous.  He was 22.  Only a week or two ago he narrowly escaped death when thrown from a spring wagon, the wheel of which badly bruised his arm.  He was employed by the Unicorn Brewery and had to attend to and water the horses.  The accident occurred in the Brewery Yard.  E.W. Crewes JP deemed an inquest unnecessary.

[Born 20 May 1877: died 14 January 1900]
