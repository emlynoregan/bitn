Burra Boy Scouts recent visit to Adelaide is reported in an article running for about 3 columns.  The occasion was the visit of Lord & Lady Baden-Powell to Adelaide.

On arrival at Adelaide they were taken to the great camp at ‘Wetunga’ the residence of the Chief Commissioner for SA, Captain S.A. White at Fulham.  They were up at 6 a.m. for ablutions and breakfast at 7 a.m.  About 500 boys were in camp.  There was a Scouts Own Service and then most went to Henley Beach.

On Monday after inspection, which the Burra troop passed with commendation, four special trams moved the scouts to the city to meet the World’s Chief Scout and Guide, Lord & Lady Baden-Powell of Gilwell.  Country Scouts numbering about 700 massed in front of the Town Hall and after seeing their leaders’ arrival the scouts went to the Botanic Gardens for lunch.  Meanwhile there was a civic reception for the Leaders.  In the afternoon scouts were on duty at the opening of the Scouts and Guides Handcraft Exhibition in the Exhibition Building.  L. Twist and C. Twist conducted Lady Baden-Powell around the exhibition.

On Tuesday trams took the scouts from camp to West’s Pictures for a special program at 4d a head.  The afternoon was free.  That night was quite frosty.

Wednesday afternoon saw the first rehearsal for the rally.

On Thursday there was another rehearsal followed by free time.

On Friday the scouts inspected the Shell Co. facilities at Birkenhead to see how petrol and kerosene tins were made, filled and sealed.  Also the refining and mixing of oils and the blacksmiths’ and joiners’ shops and the boiler rooms before a trip to the top of one of the two huge tanks holding 2½ million gallons of motor spirit (about 40ft high).  On Friday night there was a camp fire comprising a 6ft x 6ft x 8ft high pile of pine logs.  An estimated public audience of 3-4,000 was present.  Trams brought in city scouts to make a total of some 2,000 Rovers, Cubs and Scouts.

On Saturday morning the tents etc. had to be dismantled and the packing up done.  Special trams arrived at 9 a.m.  The Chief Scout paid an impromptu visit.  The Great rally at the Adelaide Oval came alive at 2.30 p.m. when the Chiefs arrived.  The venue was packed with about 40-50,000 making a total gathering of about 60,000, which must be a record.  There was a march past.  The Chief Guide gave her address followed by Lord Baden-Powell.  The Sea Scouts fired a rope from the top of the scoreboard to the oval where it was made secure and a breeches buoy was sent up to ‘rescue’ those in the scoreboard.  A host of other activities also went on and the Burra contingent had to leave before it all finished in order to catch their train, reaching the station c. 6 p.m.
