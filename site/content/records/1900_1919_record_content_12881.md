The Malachite Reef that wasn’t.  On 9 January John Macklvie, an old man, arrived at the Commercial Hotel, had a good meal and a good drink and then produced some samples of malachite which he claimed to have found on Princess Royal.  For some time he was well supplied with drinking friends as he retold the story of its discovery.  Though shouted a good many drinks he carefully avoided saying where the find was precisely located.  He talked his way into a bed for the night and after that a hearty breakfast.  He was invited to dinner at a prominent resident’s and of course he accepted and ate well.  After this a party was formed to go to the reef on Princess Royal.  Once out there he managed to leave the group for a few moments and then to disappear without trace.  A search was made for him, but to no avail.  The whole thing was a hoax and it is suggested that it started as a bet that such a trick could not be pulled off.

[The story takes 3½ columns of small print.]
