Election meeting for Burra District

[This meeting is reported in a very long article of no particular interest in the most part unless you desire a detailed knowledge of issues of concern at this particular election.  The speakers were principally J.B. Neales and J.P. Boucaut.  Mr McCulloch spoke briefly to thank people for their support in the past and to indicate he would not be standing again as other candidates had come forward.]

J.B. Neales:

He felt that a deal of the trouble for the North was that electors failed to make him aware of what their needs were.  He did his best, but they should tell him more.

He was concerned about middlemen making money from land sales.

Given that the Government had to raise money, he favoured the ad valorem duties.

He had been advised that there was no problem about started work on the Burra railway at the Burra end or at other points along the route.

Roads in the North were a disgrace, but he feared that even when they were built there would be problems maintaining them.  He did not think tolls a good solution and was not sure that District Councils would be the answer either.

He did not advocate denominational teaching in Government schools, but he would not utterly banish Bible reading.

Mr Boucaut:

He agreed with much of what Mr Neales had said.

Immigration had been overdone, but it should not be altogether stopped, but better tailored to needs.

As Mr Neales had said the present land purchase system was rotten.
