Bank Nationalisation.  The Mayor Mr H.J.B. Jennison presided over a meeting in the Town Hall on Wednesday night to protest the Government’s move to nationalise the banks.  Mr P.J. Pickering, who said he was not connected with any bank or political party, but had 40 years of banking experience, spoke in support of private banks.  Mr L. Hawke spoke against it on the basis of the potential invasion of privacy and the difficulty in getting credit for Australia from overseas.

‘Stalin had said that once you have the banks nationalised then you have the small man just where you want him.’

M.G. Dobson also spoke of the move as unnecessary.

Mr J. Hogan strongly objected to other speakers allying Stalin with the Labor Party.

A motion expressing alarm and indignation was carried.
