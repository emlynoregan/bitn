Notes of a Ten Days’ Tour to the Murray and the North

[Almost four columns of small print.]

On Monday 10 March a party of five set out from Rundle Street and travelled via Campbelltown, Paradise, Anstey’s Hill, Houghton, Chain of Ponds, Lyndoch, Tanunda, Penrice, Angaston, Truro and Moorundee (Blanchetown) to North-West Bend.  [This is narrated in great detail.]

About five miles towards Moorundee from North-West Bend is Von Rieben’s Hotel, from where there is no human habitation until within a few miles of Burra Burra.

From Von Rieben’s to Burra Burra is 50-60 miles and of this 40-45 miles are over an entirely waterless plain.  There is a track, which remains from an attempt by the SA Mining Association to get a particular type of sand some years ago.  Unfortunately we missed it, but eventually came across it by travelling northwest until our path intersected the track.  Few people attempt this crossing and one of the few was the late Mr Hamilton, Inspector of Sheep, who paid for it with a fit of illness, which detained him some time in Kooringa.

The soil along the way is a red loam clay and there is little or no sand.  The country is thinly dotted with trees arranged in clumps, a mile or two apart, and separated by shrubs with beautiful foliage and brilliant blossoms.  Teatree flourishes in places.  The appearance suggests that water might be easily got by sinking and if it could be obtained the area could be magnificent for agriculture.

We encountered a pair of emus about midway across the plains.  We also came across a native funeral pyre. [One of the party took the skull and later presented it to the museum in Adelaide.]  At Baldina Creek many sheep and cattle are depastured.  It rained as we approached Kooringa, where we arrived wet to the skin and quite lost in the darkness.  It is easy to reach Kooringa via the Adelaide Road, but to approach from the east is another matter in the pitch dark.  It took us an hour of wandering and misdirection before we sat down to a good cup of tea at Barker’s Hotel.  This is an enormous stone edifice – too large for its trade - built some years since by William Paxton.  It stands as the first house on entering Burra from Adelaide and consequently lies outside the town, which seems rather to be receding from it, rather than growing towards it.

The Burra is situated in a circle of hills, which rise around the three townships of Kooringa, Redruth and Aberdeen, which make up Burra Burra.  In its heart is a tortuous creek and the whole area is intersected by deep creeks and gullies formed by the large volumes of water coming down from the hills.  Some years ago for one and a half miles along the creek some 2,000 persons were living in caves dug out of its side.  The chimneys of which consist of shafts opening into the roadway above, with the orifices protected by beer barrels or other contrivances.  A great flood washed out these subterraneous tenements and now nothing remains of these former dwellings but the holes that served for chimneys.

There is no municipality or local government and the roads are fast being washed away by immense creeks, which are opened every winter.  There is nowhere else in the colony where some kind of local regulations are so much needed.

‘The whole place wears an aspect of great desolation: no allotments are enclosed; no gardens are planted; no vegetation can be seen; even the hilltops are unable to boast a single tree amongst them.  The dwellings look as if dropped from the clouds; and with the exception of a few tradespeople, who have opened really handsome shops, the whole population might be supposed to be in the act of packing up to be off.  Even the very buildings, though formed of a most durable blue clay slate, are put together as if they were only wanted to hold up for a few years until the final exodus took place.’

We went to the Rev. Ibbetson’s Church of England service, where he preached to about twenty-three adults and a few children.  The Methodists were however, well attended and the external morals of the town are much improved, owing greatly to the enforcement of the public-house law on Sundays by Sergeant Bolus over the past three months.

On Sunday 15 March a terrific thunderstorm broke and rain fell in a deluge.  The sun the next day turned the town into a steam bath.  We visited the Burra Burra Works where Captain Roach showed us over the premises of the SA Mining Association.  We were too late to go down a shaft and had to be content with surface matters.  The enormous engine of 240 HP with a beam of 30 tons works 65,000 strokes a week and is a beautiful piece of machinery.  It pumps the water from the deeper levels of the mine.  This water is then used for washing the ore and other mine purposes.  A new shaft is being sunk below the 50 fathom level, for which great hopes are entertained.  Vast heaps of ore lie on the ground in hues of blue, green, red and brown.  The works are busy with men and horses everywhere.  The Mines are conducted with singular freedom from accident and as there is no fire damp, candles are used at all levels.  The Company is fortunate in having the energetic Captain Roach, whose aim appears to be to have all in first rate order.  We were shown a magnificent cabinet of specimens on ores.

Illness forced the party to be split into two at this point and two members with the guide set out for Apoinga via Sod Hut.  Some work continues to be done at Apoinga, where some 100 to 150 loads of wood are consumed in smelting every week.  The men ruined the works when the gold rush broke out, because the management refused to let them go before the completion of their contract.  As a consequence the proprietor suffered heavy losses.  Hundreds of tons of slag it is said will pay for re-smelting.  An immense mass of copper was lately discovered at the bottom of one of the furnaces.  It took 14 bullocks to drag it out.

[The party then returned to Adelaide by way of Tothill’s Creek, Hamilton, Kapunda, Sheoak Log, Gawler, Little Para, Dry Creek and Nailsworth.]
