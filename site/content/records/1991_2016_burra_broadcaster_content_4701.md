Heysen Trail Trek

About 40 women are walking the length of the trail.  They travelled the last section into Burra by horse and wagon and stayed at Redruth Camp Centre over the weekend.  Half of the group planted a total of 700 trees around Burra on Saturday and Sunday – 250 at the old charcoal pits as a woodlot for Paxton Cottages and 450 at the Showgrounds.  The other half toured Burra sites.  [In view of the Burra Burra DC report Issue 179, 21 September 1994, page 2 below the ‘charcoal pits’ would seem to refer to the slag paddock.]
