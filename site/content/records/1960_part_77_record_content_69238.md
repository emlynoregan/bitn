St Edmund’s Anglican Church, Booborowie

The golden jubilee celebrations were held on Sunday in prefect weather.  Extra chairs doubled the capacity to 120 or more and a further 60 people had to remain outside and listen on a public address system.  97 people received Holy Communion.  The church has been undergoing restoration for the event.  The painters finished the exterior on Friday morning and the ladies of the church gave it a thorough clean and polish on Friday.  The Tr Rev. S.B. Rosier, Bishop of Willochra, preached.  A luncheon followed in Booborowie Hall.  Former parishioners came back from across the state and members of the local Methodist and catholic congregations also attended.  The Rector, Rev. John Stephenson, welcomed the congregation.

In its early days the congregation met in the home of Mr B.H. Beaven, until the present church was built.  Mrs D.H. Campbell decorated the cake with its 50 candles, which were lit by Mr T. Bailey, a member of the original building committee.  Mrs L. Farrelly, who had been present at the laying of the foundation stone, extinguished the candles.  The collection of $323.37, when put with donations on hand, will make a total of about $700.  Since then the sum has increased to $879.  Repairs and painting may cost about $690, so there will be some over for repainting the interior.
