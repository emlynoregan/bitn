Obituary.  William Robert Stewart died suddenly at Petherton Mt Bryan on 9 June.  He was the only son of the late Mr William Stewart who was for many years a Master Mariner.  Mr Stewart was born at Goolwa 29 February 1876 and when he was four his father took up land at Erskine, near Orroroo, where the family resided for many years.  After several years of drought it was decided to leave Erskine and a farm was secured at Petherton when that estate was subdivided.  Mr Stewart Sen. died however, before leaving Erskine.  Mr Stewart, his mother and youngest sister moved to Petherton.  In 1916 Mrs & Miss Stewart left the farm to live at Yongala and Mr Stewart was married to Miss Myrtle Wardle of Mt Bryan in 1917.  They lived on the farm till Mr Stewartâ€™s death.  He took a keen interest in farming matters and was an enthusiastic worker for the Methodist Church, having been a member of choirs at Peak Vale and Mt Bryan Churches.  His mother died in 1927.  His wife survives, but there are no children.  He is survived by three sisters: Mrs C.F. Symons (Balaklava), Mrs F.L. Ward (Yongala) and Mrs T.W. Thomas (Huddlestone.)  (Another sister, Mrs A.T. Symons of Mannanarie, died five years ago.)
