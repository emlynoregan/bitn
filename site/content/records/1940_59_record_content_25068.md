A Welcome Home was accorded eight returned servicemen at the Burra Town Hall on Thursday evening.  The Mayor presided.

Pte Jettner of Booborowie had seen several years of service.

H. Westulke RAN came from Spalding.

Pte Beckwith of Mt Bryan had been serving in Darwin before being taken prisoner by the Japanese at the fall of Singapore.

Pte Ray James had seen much service in Borneo and the Islands and had been away 3Â½ years.

Pte Harding had not enlisted from Burra, but his wife had lived here for several years and Pte Harding was regarded as a Burraite.

Pte Merv Kemble had seen service overseas.

Pte Hartley Aberg had done splendid service as a cook in the Islands and various parts of the tropics.

LAC Heinrich had been helping to keep planes flying in the Islands.

K.R. Crewes spoke for the Burra RSL and Rev. Cowle for the Welfare Committee.

Pte Beckwith said that it was a thrill to know that while a POW people in Australia were still behind them and he and his comrades had got a wonderful reception.

Pte Kemble thought the boys who returned were not getting a fair do.

Pte Aberg though Burra needed to produce a few more Tommy Woollacotts.

LAC Heinrich said there were many places which had not put up as good a show as Burra and he was thrilled to see what Burra had done during the war.  It was easy to come home and complain that a man was not properly rehabilitated, but it was not easy to do so, especially if a man would not help himself.  There were many still left in the Islands having a lonely and boring time.
