The reduction of £640 in the capital value is not nearly a fair decrease when it is known that nearly everything was charged for with interest when it was understood that cost price would be charged.  Also the old works at the north end of town had over twice their value imposed.  The editor believes that ‘the waterworks were never required here’.

‘there is no doubt but that the construction of the works was one of the greatest mistakes ever made in the local chamber of legislation.’

One argument was that in the event of fire they would be useful, but at present ‘neither the town nor one of its residents have a hose by which the water could be applied’.
