P. Cornwell, a close friend of the late Sgt P.D. (Darby) Killicoat, has just received a small Union Jack from Len. J. Fawcett, (late of Kapunda).  It was a flag he had given to Darby and was inscribed ‘Finder kindly return to P. Cornwell, Burra SA’.  Dave had given it to Fawcett a few days after he returned from Gallipoli.
