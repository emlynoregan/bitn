‘Davey Green’ writes deploring the information he has been told that Burra put no case for having the 1st junction of the Morgan-Whyalla pipeline at Burra instead of Hanson.  He also hears that the secondary scheme to bring the water to Terowie, Peterborough, etc. will also by-pass Burra to the west.  Is it too late to do something about this?
