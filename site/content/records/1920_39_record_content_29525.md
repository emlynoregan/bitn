Burra Water Supply.  Last week the Mayor, Cr Pearce & the Town Clerk formed a deputation to the Commissioner of Public Works to point out the parlous state of the Town’s water supply.  The town was growing, but the supply system (apart from a larger storage tank) was as when installed c. 40 years ago.  The problem is the mains which are too small.  In the last five years at least 40 new homes have been added and septic tanks provided.  About 100 services have been laid on in that time.  They thought that Kooringa required an 8” main with a 6” one possibly to Aberdeen and 4” reticulation in the main streets.  Shortage of water at the hospital and larger businesses including hotels was stressed.  The minister said that following approaches in November last a scheme had been designed by the Hydraulic Engineer and money provided in the estimates that allowed for a start to be made involving 66 chains of 6” main and 35½ chains of 4” main.

We understand the 6” main is to run from the Royal Exchange Hotel to Kooringa and the new 4” main will replace existing corroded 3” and this will more than double the pressure.
