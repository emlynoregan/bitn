From the Report of E.H. Hargreaves

While at Kooringa I obtained through the kindness of Mr Porter at Springbank a fossil rock taken from a depth of 120 feet from Messrs Killicoat & Ford’s station on the Eastern Plains.  It contained a number of fossils belonging, I Suppose, to the Miocene Tertiary formation; genera turritella (very numerous), pectens, arca, cardia, lucina and others.  I continued north, it being useless to search for gold in this formation.

Going north, I discovered, between Booborowie and Canowie a fossil rock containing numerous organic remains of the genus natica, elenchus and serpulœ, probably of the Pliocene Tertiary epoch and on the Bendiuta Plains the shells of the recent helix in great abundance and well preserved.
