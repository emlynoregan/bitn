Kooringa News, 5 November

There has been a sudden exodus of miners to the Newcastle coal mines.  A gentleman from there has been here engaging miners for Newcastle and things are so unpromising here and the terms offered so tempting that I am informed that upwards of 100 miners have engaged to proceed to Newcastle.  This has created a sensation in the town.  Men everywhere are seen discussing the topic and others are engaged in selling off all they can spare ‘at enormous sacrifices’.  A four-roomed house and contents were sold for £40.  While some say it would be unwise to break up their homes to venture to Newcastle, others say that they cannot be worse off; for many here are not getting 30/- a week at the Burra Mines.  What in undoubted is that their departure cannot but have an adverse effect on trade here, which will not be made up again for some time at least.

Obituary/Inquest.  An inquest was held on Tuesday on the body of the deceased boy Pollard aged about 9.  On Monday morning he went with one or two companions to the Mine and while there elected to have a bath in one of the small reservoirs connected with the pumping engines.  His companions tried to dissuade him, but he undressed and jumped in.  Being unable to swim, when the water proved to be beyond his depth, he sank and drowned before assistance could be obtained.  The jury returned a verdict of accidental death from drowning.

[William Henry Pollard died 4 November 1862 at Kooringa aged 8; son of George Pollard.]

On Friday the adjourned volunteer meeting was resumed.  The memorial to the Chief Secretary was adopted and signed by all present.   I understand that about 40 signatures were obtained and that it has been despatched.

With respect to the election, the aforementioned apathy continues.  So far it seems there is to be no opposition to the present candidates, Messrs Neales and Coles.

Large quantities of wool continue to pass through the township.
