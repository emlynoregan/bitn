Hallett Power Station

Work on this 180 megawatt station is progressing well and is ahead of schedule.  160 to more than 200 tradespersons are working there at any one time.  Work is expected to take six months.  The plant will be a top-up generator and may not run in cool years.  It will use gas from Epic’s Moomba pipeline just 600 m away.  There are currently six turbines on site with six more in Perth and due at Hallett in early December.  The first 90 megawatts are due to come on line by the end of December with the other 90 by the end of January next.
