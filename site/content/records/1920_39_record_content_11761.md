Eight Hours Day activities were marred by wet and boisterous weather.  The AOF picnic went ahead at Johnson’s Creek, but at 10 a.m. steady rain set in making luncheon difficult and an early return had to be made.  The Rifle Club’s Championship was abandoned at midday.  Both events will be rescheduled.
