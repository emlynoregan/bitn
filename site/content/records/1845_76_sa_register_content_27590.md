Mt Bryan East, 17 April

Farmers are sowing and ploughing.

A public meeting was held recently re the mail.  The postal contracts will soon expire and it was thought a branch mail from Mt Bryan Flat Post Office would serve well without interrupting the present contractor.

It is generally thought that the Rabbit Act should have made it compulsory for the landowners to clear their land of these pests.

Many settlers think there should be another Hundred declared east of the Hundred of Hallett. Many would rather settle there than go further north.  It would help present settlers by encouraging tradespeople to come to the area.
