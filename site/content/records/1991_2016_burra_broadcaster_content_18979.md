Burra Town Hall

The public meeting to discuss the future of the Town Hall was well attended last week.  The meeting endorsed the idea of the hall remaining primarily a community facility.  It was pointed out that Burra had other facilities that were also used by the community and the hall needed to be used to be financially viable and the use would have to be extended with perhaps more concerts, film shows and craft fairs.  Perhaps it could accommodate an ‘internet café’ and conferences were another possibility.  For that though, it would have to be upgraded.  The new Council had taken over the Civic Centre for office space, effectively removing from Burra one facility and so it was said the Council had a responsibility for the loss of amenities the community used to enjoy at the Civic Centre.  An interim steering committee was established.
