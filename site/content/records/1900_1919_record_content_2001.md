Editorial on the retiring Council which has worked well together, done what was needed and finished with a credit balance in every department!  The waterworks account is in a flourishing state with a credit balance of Â£341.  The editor feels however that the cemetery is a disgrace and the coming year should see money spent on it.  The slaughterhouse question is hanging fire and this too should be attended to, though here the fault lies as much with those who framed the by-laws.  The town is generally looking good and the sanitary condition is excellent.
