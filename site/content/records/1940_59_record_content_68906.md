Wayne Sibly writes as they cross the Mediterranean towards Pt Said.  He tells of their visit to Naples and Pompeii.  A later letter described their crossing of the Indian Ocean towards Colombo under the influence of a storm due to a tropical cyclone, which caused flooding in many cabins.  Despite the severe conditions he says he has not yet been sick.  The storm means they will miss Bombay and may not be able to go ashore at Colombo, as they are already a day late.
