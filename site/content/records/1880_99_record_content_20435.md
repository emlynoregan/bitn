Inquest into the death of a man found hanged in a hut in the township of Douglas on Sunday

J. Dunstan, coroner, at the Court House Hotel.  H. Pinch foreman of the jury.

George Hosler, unemployed labourer, entered the hut on Sunday 29 November having been travelling towards Morgan.  He was accompanied by Edward Willmott.  While Willmott was reading a notice on the door I noticed a man I first thought was standing up, but soon saw was hanging.  We went to Baldina and told Mr Barker.  Have seen the deceased previously, but don’t know his name.  Should think the body was hanging 24 hours.  No identification of the man’s name or place of origin.

Edward Willmott unemployed labourer corroborated.  The position in which the body was found suggests he hanged himself.  Fancy I have seen him in the northeast.  There was no appearance of foul play.  Did not enter the hut.

Police Trooper Williams from Redruth arrived at the scene about 2.45 p.m.  Found the body hanging from a rafter.  The feet were just touching the ground with the twine deeply sunk in the neck close up behind the ears.  His hat was on his head.  On the window ledge were slight marks as if a boot had recently slipped over it.  This was a possible means of reaching the rafter to tie the twine.  The body was rigid.  Death seems to have occurred 24-30 hours previously.  No other signs of violence.  Search of the body did not reveal any identification.  Various items (watch, knife, matches etc.) were found.  No signs of a struggle.  The body was very thin and I should not think the deceased was used to hard physical labour.  Age c. 32-34.  Efforts to identify the deceased have been unsuccessful.

Verdict - death by hanging himself and no evidence to indicate his state of mind at the time.
