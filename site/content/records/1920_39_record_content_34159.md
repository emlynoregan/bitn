Burra Town Council, 23 April

F.H. Kuchenmeister permitted to build a 5-roomed house at Paradise.

Kooringa Methodist Sunday School held its 31st anniversary on 27 April and it was very successful.  The services were taken by Rev. F.J. Barnes who is newly appointed to the Redruth circuit.

Tom Canny writes from Gum Creek PO querying why the RSA was not consulted over the guns.  As for Cr Allen’s statement that the RSA had three years to do something: they had no authority to do so.

Cr Pearce sees the guns as monuments to ‘the devilish ingenuity of mankind’.  ‘[N]ext time I visit the Burra I expect to see the figure of the soldier on the top of the monument minus the rifle and bayonet.’

[He also has a shot at Cr Allen for suggesting the returned men should pay for the mounting of the guns: perhaps out of their deferred pay or their pensions!]
