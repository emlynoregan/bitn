Obituary & Inquest on Frank Pearce, 20 September.

T.H. Wilkinson JP was coroner and held an inquest on the body of Frank Pearce, found shot in the Bible Christian Church at Kooringa on 19 September.

John Drew:

Identified the body, was called to the old church on 19 September where he saw the deceased lying in the northeast corner with a rifle under his legs.  Sent for the doctor and the police.  Last saw the deceased on 17 September when he looked haggard.

Elizabeth Jane Pearce, wife of the deceased:

Last saw him about 7 a.m. on the 19th at breakfast.  Of late he had suffered from severe insomnia and had been depressed and weak.  He was avoiding people.  He had no known financial worries and was on good terms with his father and family.  He had a rifle and had been a member of the Rifle Club for years.

John Pearce, father of the deceased:

Last saw the deceased between 4 & 5 p.m. on the 18th.  He seemed dull and worried, as he had for 5 or 6 weeks.  Went to see him about 8.30 a.m. yesterday at the post office and not finding him went to my workshop and then back to the post office before going to his house, on leaving which I looked into the old church and saw him lying in the corner, dead.
