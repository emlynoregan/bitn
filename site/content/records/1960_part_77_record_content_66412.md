Barkers of Baldina Cottage Homes have been occupied now for a few weeks, but they will officially be opened by Miss Priscilla Brown, step-daughter of the late J.R. Barker, at 2.30 p.m. next Sunday.  There is sufficient land available for a further nine units and it is the intention of the Board to proceed immediately with site preparation and erect the additional units as finance permits.
