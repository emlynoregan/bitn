Burra Hospital Auxiliary secretary Robyn Baker reports on a busy yearâ€™s work.

Catering has been prominent and involves much hard work for a small group.  The Melbourne Cup Luncheon was a great success, but was a long day and a mammoth effort.  In twelve months the Auxiliary has raised $5,010.  More and younger members are needed to ensure the work of the Auxiliary continues into the future.  Unexpected work and personal commitments mean that I will no longer be able to carry on as secretary of the Auxiliary.
