L. O’Loughlin was a Liberal and favoured closer settlement.  He thanked voters for their previous support.  He did not want to say anything against the Labor Party, but would continue as a Liberal.  He objected to vulgar interruptions, but would answer any questions.  In his term in office great things had taken place in respect to farming and this was due to the cutting up of large estates.  The Bill was introduced in 1897, though it had not made much headway for some years – he went on to say more about developments around the state that were a consequence of closer settlement.  He made reference to the franchise and to tax and to proposals to open up Eyre Peninsula where new railways were required.  He thought the Commonwealth should take over the NT and that strikes should never be permitted.
