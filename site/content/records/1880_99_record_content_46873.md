Editorial on the events in Town Council

The dark cloud finally burst.  One of the Councillors has continually been finding fault, thus delaying business.

‘There are conscientious and faithful workers in the Council and unfortunately there is a poisonous serpent amongst them who delight [sic] in stirring up hatred and malice.’

We hope the elections for 1893 will relegate him to obscurity.

‘When the business of the Council was about to be commenced Councillor Hardy asked [sic] one or two grossly insulting remarks which reflected on this journal, but as his colleagues – we pity them – were on the alert for any emergency he was sharply brought up to his bearings and reprimanded.’

The mayor said on Monday night that if ever he was disgusted with a meeting it was with the one dealing with the notice of motion concerning Cr Watt’s action.

‘Since we refused to accept [Hardy’s] offer of 10s (ten shillings) per week we have been the victims of several disgraceful and abusive letters and a postcard of a recent date was not allowed to pass through the post office, and which was subsequently forwarded to the Postmaster General.  Some of the letters were insufficiently stamped and others not stamped at all.  We substantiate the report in every particular notwithstanding Councillor Hardy’s vituperation.
