Announcement

Terry Wilson takes over the management of Burra Community Print.

He wishes Mick and Cheryl Bradshaw all the best in their new pursuits.  He says his wife Jill, Amy (6) and Doug (4) like it in Burra.

[Note.  This change of management produced an immediate change in the nature of the paper.  There was an immediate and dramatic increase in the coverage of what was happening in the town and district with the publication becoming a much better ‘paper of record’.]
