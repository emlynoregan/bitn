Obituary.  Roy William Lloyd died suddenly 25 November.  He was born at Erskine 10 May 1895 to pioneering Methodist parents who instilled in him and all their children the great wealth of Christian character.  Roy came to this district as a child with his parents, who took up the property known as Braefoot.  He began his education at Erskine and finished it at Copperhouse.  He was deeply respected in the community.  In WWI he enlisted in the AIF and served in the 32nd Battalion in France and Belgium and on his return took up a Soldiers’ Settlement Farm at Flagstaff.  On March 16 ‘of that year’ [sic: for 1927] he married Annie May Morgan in the Ironmine Methodist Church.  Roy Lloyd had that rare gift of dependability and was often selected as a spokesman.  His leadership was noticeable in his WWI service and in WWI, in which he gave service in the VDC. The Methodist Church, especially at Ironmine pays tribute to his unassuming service.  He gave great support to the interests of young people and supported also the RSL.  He contributed a unique service to the community through his gift of water divining and over 100 bores and windmills stand as a memorial to this gift.  He is survived by his widow and four children: Colin, Mary Mrs Don White, Claire Mrs Athol Tiver and Donald.  There are eight grandchildren.

[Born 10 May 1895 Hundred of Morgan.]
