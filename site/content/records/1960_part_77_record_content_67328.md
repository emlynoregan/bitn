W.E.D. Young writes re the parachutist who descended into the woodheap at Burra North.  Local boys were so inspired by this that they constructed ‘a parachute’ from canvas, ropes and binder-twine.  The top of O’Leary’s slaughterhouse roof was selected for a take-off point with W.E.D. as the parachutist.  In a cold withering wind he launched himself from about 45 ft and landed in a heap of junk, badly bruised, with a broken jaw and a lacerated tongue.  [William (Bill) Young would have been 11 in December 1909, when the parachutist landed in the woodheap.]
