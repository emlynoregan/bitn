Meals on Wheels.  Burra’s Jan Tiver is one of more than 500 volunteers to receive a lifetime award for her 45 years of voluntary service to Meal on Wheels in SA.  They will be honoured at the Meals on Wheels annual awards ceremony in Adelaide on 13 November.  Betty Thamm and Jan are the only volunteers with 45 years’ service and Betty retired from the service a few months ago.  The Burra Branch commenced on 26 July 1971 and has since delivered 139,767 meals.  There are currently 40 volunteers and 10 clients.
