Steve & Anne Royal write in response to Matt Reilly on mining in Burra.

Matt Reilly says he welcomes a strong debate.  In such it is essential to assess relevant facts.  Some of these facts are:

According to Phoenix Copper’s 2010 Annual Report Mr Reilly has over 1.5 million shares in the company and has been granted a further 2 million options.  If exploration commences in the mine reserve he will receive a further 800,000 shares and 800,000 options.  If a significant ore reserve is discovered, he will receive $200,000 and a further $100,000 if any tailings or waste material from the Monster Mine is processed.  He will also receive 6% royalty for all metals derived from the mine.  Mr Reilly says three hotels have closed in Burra, but fails to mention that two of them have reopened.  The closure of at least one of them seems to have nothing to do with the lack of mining in Burra.  At last year’s town meeting the New Zealand town of Waihi (pop. 4,500) was actively marketed by Phoenix as a shining example of how great mining was for a town.  Newmont Mining operates a large open cut gold mine in the middle of town and Waihi’s situation is similar to what Burra may be facing.  Far from being a bonanza for the town, it seems to have been very bad for them.  According to the NZ census data for 2006 the median income for Waihi residents is $15,200 compared with a median income of $24,100 p.a. for the whole Waikato Region.

In Waihi 62% of the population has an annual income of $20,000 or less.  For the entire region this figure is 43%.  In the town only 7% earn over $50,000, while for the region this figure is 17%.  The region has 5.3% unemployment, while Waihi has 8.2%.  The mine seems to have done little for real estate either.  The average house price in the Coromandel region is $415,110 and in Waihi it is $307,000 with about 200 houses for sale in the town.  Several houses in Waihi have disappeared into the ground and several others are deemed to unsafe to live in.

Mr Reilly asserts that ‘there is money in the mine…and that money is for Burra’.  This is not correct.  Any money in the mine will be for Phoenix Copper and a few of their stakeholders, Mr Reilly included.  There will be a few short term jobs created – Phoenix themselves give only a five-year lifespan for Burra operations.  After that Burra would be left with no new jobs, no mine and no money, just one hell of a mess to clean up.

We wholeheartedly support Phoenix Copper in their ventures in the region, but mining must not commence in Burra or in any other residential area.  Burra needs to find a way of progressing that does not rely on the destruction of the town.

Mr Koutsantonis at a meeting in Burra on 17 August said there was no way that he would allow mining in the Burra Mine pit.  It is disappointing that this announcement hasn’t received more publicity.
