Burra Town Council, Monday.

It was decided to get a sample of a new acetylene gas generator for streetlamps.

Sara & Co. were given permission to erect a water trough.

Inspection showed that fowls had been roosting on the fire reel, so it was decided to erect a shelter for it in the police yard.

The Town Clerk said the whole of tar-dressing had been charged to main roads account, but all except 24â€™ would have to be recharged to the wards.

The Mortuary Chapel at the cemetery is to be re-painted.
