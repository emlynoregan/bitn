Mintaro News, 14 May

The closure of the Burra Mine has seriously affected farmers here by removing a market and as a result they welcome the commencement of the Pt Wakefield Railway and the push to extend the northern railway.

Mintaro can now expand as Mr Peter Brady has subdivided a quantity of land into half acre allotments, of which twenty were sold on Wednesday at an average of Â£50 per acre.  There is demand for more.

The Wesleyan Chapel is about to be opened.
