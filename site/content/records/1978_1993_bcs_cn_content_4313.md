Burra Burra DC is concerned at the amount of recreational land scattered about the town.  One such area is the tennis courts between Smelts Road and the Crescent.  A proposal has been brought forward to subdivide the area south of the toilet block into eight building blocks and to sell them for residential development and devote the proceeds to the provision of new tennis courts at the War Memorial Oval.  The section of parklands with trees will remain [i.e. the old Burra North Playground.]  The plan would require that buyers erect houses within four years and that the blocks could not be sold prior to the erection of a house, without the prior consent of Council.

Council invites public comment.
