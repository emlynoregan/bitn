The Main Street Program has improved Burra according to Mr S. Woolley of the Burra Tradersâ€™ Association.  Last week a meeting of the Association was addressed by Mr D. Hele from the USA on the subject of the program.  Mr Woolley said that many individual shop owners had started to improve their premises in small ways.  The overall plan for the future was to improve the Market Square area.  Traders were planning street entertainment and the appearance of Father Christmas this year.
