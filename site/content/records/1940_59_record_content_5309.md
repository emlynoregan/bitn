‘Mater familias’ writes re Sunday Observance.  In disagreeing it isn’t necessary to be disagreeable.  I wish we could always remember that, there are other Commandments besides ‘Keeping Holy the Sabbath’, such as ‘Thou shalt love thy neighbours’.  One finds very little of this in the many letters published on this topic.
