Burra Town Council.

A new fence for Jubilee Avenue has been erected from Mr Hartlettâ€™s corner to the Institute.  There are red gum posts throughout and 3 wires plus a top rail.  We hope soon to see it extended to Aberdeen.

M-C John Clarke has been transferred to Brighton and will be replaced by M-C P.W. Clark from Jamestown.

Mr Davey Sen. has just retired as District Clerk at age 82.  He arrived in Burra in 1851 and worked in the mine for some years and was later storekeeper there.  He was librarian and caretaker at the Burra Institute for 22 years and Town Clerk of the Burra Corporation for 10 years.  He was also secretary of the Loyal Burra Burra Lodge for 15 years and Clerk of the Burra District Council for 11 years.
