Obituary.  Frank T. Sara has died aged 57.  Nearly 40 years ago he left the firm of G. & R. Wills & Co. in Perth to join his parents in their Aberdeen business, formerly Messrs Tiver & Sons.  Through the years he has seen many changes and been instrumental in the growth of the business known as Sara & Co. of Burra North and Burra.  He also took a keen interest in the church and in public affairs.  He was an organist of the Burra-Redruth Church for about 17 years and also a trustee.  He was organist at the Kooringa Masonic Lodge and has also been a Past Master.  He was an active member of the Burra Institute Committee and a keen bowler with the Burra Bowling Club.  He married Miss Annie Hazel Bartholomaeus and their growing family lived for many years at Burra North.  About four years ago the family moved to Payneham, though Mr Sara made weekly trips to Burra for business and spent the weekends with his family at Payneham and in contacting Adelaide firms in connection with the business.  Mrs Sara died last June.  The surviving members of the family are: Elizabeth (Mrs T. McRae-Wood of Blackwood), Claire (Mrs Robert Campbell of Burra North), Miss P. Ruth Sara and Miss Cynthia R. Sara (of Payneham) and David S. Sara, now associated with Messrs Thomas Pascoe and Robert Campbell in the firm of Sara & Co.  [Frank Tiver Sara, born 4 January 1890 at Aberdeen: died 8 December 1947 at Payneham.]
