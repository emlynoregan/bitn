Burra Town Council

With rising costs of materials and labour the Council is having trouble with its finances and consequently discussed making a new assessment this year.  A new assessment would cost money and the Mayor favoured a higher rate on the old assessment.  Councillor Baulderstone argued that to make ends meet the new rate would have to be about 4/- and people who were properly assessed at the moment would pay the piper, while those under-assessed would get of comparatively lightly.  The quote last year for a new assessment was Â£90.  The motion to get a new assessment was carried.

The Salvation Army will have a visit from Brigadier H. Rust to conduct their Harvest Thanksgiving Service  on Sunday next.  In 1926 his daughter and her husband were in charge of the Salvation Army in Burra and in 1939, a granddaughter, Capt. M. Rust was appointed to the Corps.

Burra Rifle Club.  A general meeting will be held in the Burra Show Office on Friday night and it is hoped the rifles that have been ordered will be available that night.  Shooting should commence about next Saturday week.  The range has been inspected and is in good condition, with a couple of minor faults only to be fixed.
