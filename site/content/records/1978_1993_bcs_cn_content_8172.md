They suggested off-road vehicle users were violating Native Clearance Control Regulations by removing mallee for fires and that the Council was liable for this as the leaseholder.  It recommended that the RAA be requested to delete Redbanks Reserve as a recognised off-road vehicle area.  (They felt that a partial removal of off-road vehicles would be ineffective.)  It was recommended that application be made under the Native Vegetation Retention Scheme for the fencing of the reserve to keep out off-road vehicles.
