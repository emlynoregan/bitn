Burra Town Council, 8 November.

W. Williams has been contracted to build a kerb wall in Commercial St at 11d per super yard.

Mr Batchelor will have the flagging in front of his shop replaced when the new levels are reached.  Any owner of adjacent property has leave to build in steps up the kerb provided they meet the satisfaction of the surveyor.
