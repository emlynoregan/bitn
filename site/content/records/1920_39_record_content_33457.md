Cr Woollacott moved as an amendment that the question of allocations be referred back to the Finance Committee.  He countered Cr Pearce’s arguments with ones that North Ward had greater lengths of local roads which are used by everyone, whereas East Ward has only the cemetery road of that sort.  Also they had roads on hills that were cut out every rain.  Further North Ward funds had been used to help pay for bridges near W. Geake’s & W. Finch’s and the ford at the Pig & Whistle.  The Mayor said no to the ford.
