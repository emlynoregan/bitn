He had come to Burra with his parents and sister when most people there were Cornish.  The church was then much as it was now, despite several alterations and additions, but he believed it could then hold c. 100 more people because the seats were then all straight-backed and could be put closer together.  It was Rev. Stevenson’s time and the pulpit was very high.  It was at this time that collections were instituted.  There was no organ, but music of flutes, clarinets and other wind instruments, including a serpent.

Dr Brummitt’s address.

I entered this church 36 years ago next Monday, having arrived the previous day at Pt Adelaide and travelled to Burra on the afternoon train.  I travelled up with a tall slender young man and we talked all the way without exchanging names.  On Sunday he was the preacher, Mr Holder.  That was in January 1877.  Rev. G.W. Patchell was minister, but was soon succeeded by Rev. R.W. Campbell who was strong and perhaps rather stern and came to Burra from the great Moonta Revival.  He had many admirers, but two of his children died here from diphtheria.  Then came Rev. James Bickford, but the most striking ministry was that of the Rev. Samuel Knight who came in 1882.  He was a zealous evangelist and a great and interesting preacher.  His ministry led to many conversions and to the spiritual growth and uplifting of many more.  Though 79 the Rev. Knight is still active in Melbourne and has recently celebrated his Golden Wedding.  The Rev. George E. Rowe was Mr Knight’s colleague one year and he remained two years with Rev. S.F. Prior.  He was genial, Kindly and a popular preacher, often giving special addresses to children.  He has gone on to important positions in WA and Queensland.  Rev. Prior’s great strength was his preaching.  He took small texts and placed them under a microscope, where Rev. Rowe had taken whole epistles as texts.
