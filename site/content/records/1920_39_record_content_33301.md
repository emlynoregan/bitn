Pearce’s Building is two stories and the front portion comprised eight offices, four on the ground floor and four on the upper, with a vestibule and landing.  The lower rooms were occupied by Mr M.W. Bednall solicitor and Mr E.A. Mummery dentist.  The upper rooms were occupied by Mr Mummery, Miss Alice Wilson dressmaker and Miss N. Sorensen dressmaker.  On the second floor at the rear of the building was a large hall 30ft x 20ft known as the Cheer-up Room.  The fire appears to have started on the western side of the ground floor as Mr Mummery’s rooms and Miss Wilson’s are completely gutted and also Miss Sorensen’s on the top floor eastern side.

The offices of Mr Bednall were not ablaze, but fire was eating through the ceiling and doors.  M-C Webster forced his way through the front window to save what was possible.  Recognising that he would not know what was important to save, Miss Motley (Mr Bednall’s stenographer) pluckily entered the room through the window and defying the threat from burning rafters helped to rescue about £500 worth of Mr Bednall’s professional library.  The office also held the greater number of the pamphlets of the History of the Burra Mine written by Mr Frank Treloar and these were mostly destroyed by water.  Mr Bednall was in Kadina at the time, but being notified was back by 8.30 a.m.

Losses:

Miss Sorensen who had two rooms on the top floor was uninsured and lost machines, fixtures, equipment, materials and all her personal wardrobe. (She was a boarder at the Commercial Hotel opposite.)

Miss Alice Wilson had a room opposite Miss Sorensen and was insured, but lost many things that are irreplaceable.  She lost machines, fittings, frocks and material.

Mr Mummery lost his workshop and machinery on the upper floor and the contents of his rooms on the ground floor.  He is believed to be insured.

The Cheer-up Room was also destroyed along with seating and seven large tables.

The whole building was insured and the walls appear sound.  The fire appears to have started on the ground floor on the western side in Mr Mummery’s back room.  The building was constructed by the late John Pearce in 1914 and is part of his estate owned by his daughters.  It was notable in the war years as the home of the Cheer-up Society, formed early in 1915.  Mr Pearce placed the hall at their disposal rent free for the war.  The Red Cross and League of Loyal Women also had it rent free and till his death in 1927 Mr Pearce never made a charge for patriotic or charitable uses.  The origin of the fire is a mystery.  Damage is estimated at £2,000.
