Burra Town Council, 29 October.

The Town Clerk reported that nearly all the water guarantees had been signed, but a few more names were needed.

G. Sara wrote suggesting that on the west side of the new reserve a chain street should be left instead of only half a chain.  It was resolved that 50â€™ be left.

Cr Ward called attention to a statement circulated outside by Cr Sampson to the effect that certain water guarantees had been obtained by false representations and he moved that Cr Sampson apologise.

Cr Sampson said he had not said that, but he did say that Messrs Barrett, Davis & Neville did not understand that they had signed any guarantee and would not do so, and it was a fact.

After discussion the Mayor expressed a view that Cr Sampson had been injudicious and the matter dropped.
