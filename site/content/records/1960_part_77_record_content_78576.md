BCS.  The agricultural area is developing rapidly.  Firebreaks have been graded around Wardle’s paddock and two burning off operations have cleared the vegetable area and the paddock.  A water pipe has been laid on to the area. A shed from Whyte Yarcowie has been obtained for agriculture.

Mr Richard Bednall has organised a program for senior students of the school each Friday evening at the former Salvation Army Citadel.

Year 7 had an excursion on 2 April to Mount Razorback.  The mountain was climbed before lunch.  Some kangaroos were spotted on the way up.  A sketching exercise followed the descent.  A science scavenger hunt followed and a hide and seek game ended the day.  (This report was by student Emma O’Connor.)
