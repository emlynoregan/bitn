Kooringa News, 9 February

Crown Lands Rangers have created a great disturbance locally by clearing the Mt Bryan Run of wood cutters and carters and squatters.  On Tuesday 8 February 38 appeared in court where 35 were fined; the cutters and carters Â£2 each plus costs and the squatters 5/- each plus costs.  This action under the Waste Lands Act offers the sheep farmers great protection, especially in a place like Burra where fuel is so in demand.

Wheal Sarah proprietors have taken up two more sections close to their mine, which is busy and turning out some good ore.
