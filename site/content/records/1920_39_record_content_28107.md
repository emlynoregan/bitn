On Tuesday the wind in Burra blew down the large sign in front of E.J. Harris’s store, took the roof off Alf Walker’s garage in Kingston St, blew in a front window at P.L. Rosman’s, blew the large door off the goods shed at the railway station and across the railway line and demolished the fence around H. Jennison’s home.
