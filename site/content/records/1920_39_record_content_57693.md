Obituary.  Mrs George Lord, who died at Toorak Gardens on 29 August, was well known in Burra.  She and her late husband were resident here for many years when they owned the Burra Hotel.  During that time they both interested themselves in town matters.  Mrs Lord particularly played a role during the period of WWI, when she was often seen in the big marquees erected in Market Square when luncheons etc. were held there.  The Burra Hotel was not just a hotel, but a home where visitors and busy workers could rely on getting all the assistance she, her husband and family could provide.  No matter how great the rush, Mrs Lord maintained that great quiet dignity and charm of manner habitual to her in her relations with people of all classes and creeds.  Since their retirement their visits to Burra have not been frequent and especially since her husband’s death, [1928] when her own health has not been the best.  She leaves one surviving daughter, Mrs W.H. Sandland of ‘Heathmont’ Kooringa and two surviving sons: Will & Cecil Lord of Adelaide.  There are a number of grandchildren.

[Born Caroline Phillips 24 June 1860 North Adelaide.]
