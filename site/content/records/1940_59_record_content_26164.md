The Anzac Service at Burra on Sunday was one of the largest ever with over 1,000 people assembled in Market Square.  The Hindmarsh Salvation Army Citadel Band led a parade of servicemen from both wars with a muster of about 98 men led by RSL Sub-Branch President M.T. Fuller.  This parade differed from those of previous years with the majority being young men who marched with the snap and precision of a parade ground.  The men from WWI were there as usual in force, some now showing grey hair.  Three men formed the Catafalque Party: Reg Clarke (RAN), J. Kotz (AIF) and Dick Aldridge (RAAF).  The service was shared by Rev. M.P. Cowle, Rev. A.S. Barrett, Rev. H. Hobbs, Captain Cox and Lieutenant Fernihough.  Rev. Cowle gave the address.

Mr A.E. Smith MHR has undertaken to place an idea before the right authorities from his recent meeting with the Fathersâ€™ Association.  Mr George of Booborowie had suggested that Gift Duties etc. should be waived when the father of a returned serviceman desired to rehabilitate his son by giving him a parcel of land.
