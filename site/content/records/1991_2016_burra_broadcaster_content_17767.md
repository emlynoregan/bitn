Christmas Festivities got off to a good start in Market Square on Sunday evening, with dancing, singing, a barbecue tea and then Carols by Candlelight.  There were some 58 entries in the Children’s Cake Decorating Competition.  Winners were:

2-6 years	Jaydan Alderson

7-10 years	Brooke Mitchell

11 years +	Shona Mitchell.

The auction of the cakes raised $815 for Burra Hospital towards the purchase of a special cot.
