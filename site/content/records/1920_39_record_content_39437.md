Mongolata Goldfield

News of another find of reef gold attracted about 50 men last Friday.  Claims now cover three miles of country and some were pegged by moonlight.  Mr Harold Lewis a WA prospector made the discovery about six miles northeast of the present workings and about fifteen 20-acre claims have been pegged.  Surface indications were found a week ago on the property of Percy Oates in rough flat open country.  Samples taken have traced gold for about three miles north-south in a straight line.  Value will not be known until stone has been extracted and tested.

Rampton & Clark report a crushing of 5 tons 6cwt that produced 24oz 16dwt and 9dwt from tailings for a total of 5oz 2dwt 3gr per ton.  Local value of gold was assessed at £3-18-3 per oz.    In 11 months this mine has produced 12 tons 1cwt for 61oz from a lode that varied from 3” to 8”.

The total value of gold recovered at Mongolata is now estimated at £1,000.
