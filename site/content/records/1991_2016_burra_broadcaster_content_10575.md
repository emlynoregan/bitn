Editorial.  The editor expresses disappointment that the anticipated public meeting on council amalgamations, scheduled for May, has not yet occurred.  The Council is developing a proposal to be put to such a meeting â€“ so far the community has not been consulted on the possibilities of a merger with Clare without Robertstown and Eudunda or a merger with Hallett alone.
