Mid North Merino Inspection Day on 26 August was very successful.  Crowds visited the various studs showcasing rams to be placed at auction in the next few weeks.  Two local studs holding their first on-property sales this year are ‘The Bluff’ at Hallett and ‘Springvale North’ at Burra.  Hazeldean & East Bungaree Studs presented a seminar entitled ‘Where to Now for Wool?’

Wayne Crump is the new Manager of the Burra Visitor Information Centre.  He comes from Adelaide where he studied Tourism at Adelaide TAFE (as did the previous manager Michael Hamilton).
