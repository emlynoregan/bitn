Burra Burra DC, 5 April

The Overseer is to expedite the Bon Accord Bridge road construction.

It was resolved to give $500 towards the repair of the Powder Magazine.

The Town Clerk is to draw up recommendations for the Burra Town Hall dressing room improvements.

Council resolved to close and vest in the Minister of Education that portion of Tomkusson [sic: for Tomkinson] Street dividing Pt Block 13A CT 1593/90 in GRO plan 20 of 1905 from Pt Block 13 CT 3726/50 in GRO plan 20 of 1905 and other portion of Pt Block 13 CT 3351/162 in GRO plan 20 of 1905 etc.

[It would seem that the National Trust had asked for the mine buildings that were to be demolished to be donated to them, because it was resolved to donate the buildings as requested.]
