Elders presented Mrs Jessie Rooke with a framed certificate and gift basket at an afternoon tea at Jumbucks Restaurant last Tuesday.  Mrs Edna Rooke [sic: for Jessie] and her family have been clients of Elders for 120 years.  Peter Mengersen, manager for Mrs Rooke for the past 37 years, said one lease dates back to 1881.  Mrs Rooke is now 93 years old and still lives on the property.  [Photo.]
