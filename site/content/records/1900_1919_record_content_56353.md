Australia Day, Burra, Saturday 10 August.

A fine day.  The street was festooned with flags and bunting and stalls were erected under verandahs, keeping the street clear for traffic.  The procession assembled at the station at 11.15 to await the arrival of Col. S. Price Weir DSO, who was met by Mr Crewes (the Mayor) and escorted to a car.  Sgt Dickson Thompson led with several mounted returned soldiers followed by lads on ponies.  Then came the Ladies’ band in crème dresses and hats followed by the Mayor’s car.  The Copperhouse School was commended for their boys dressed as marines with sailor costume, gun and carriage.  The girls appeared as Red Cross nurses drawing a diminutive ambulance.  Mr C. Sams’s car was decorated in daffodils and pink roses.  The Burra School Fife & Drum Band was followed by a trolly decorated with wattle and bearing the six tiny queens and their attendants:

Miss Joyce Pearse, Queen of the Fairies

Miss Betty Walker, Queen of the Flags

Miss Ruth McNeil, Queen of Games

Miss Minetta Thomas, Queen of Flowers

Miss Evelyn Moran, Queen of Nursery Rhymes

Miss Maisie Radford, Queen of Frolic

The voting for the Queens raised £414-2-6.

The Boy Scouts were well turned out and ran a penny drive.  H. Austin’s Buick was decorated with almond blossom.  The Burra School boys and girls were dressed as cadets and a 3rd Light Horse Caravan.  The newly formed Burra Band came next with J. Allen as John Bull as drum-major in their first public appearance.  Mrs Gregg’s car bore ladies in Japanese costume.  An armoured car followed.

Mr Crewes delivered a speech and read a telegram announcing a wonderful victory in France.

[The offensive at Amiens began 8 August and saw the first collapse of entire German divisions in the war.  It was part of the Foch counteroffensive.]

Col. Price Weir gave the main address.  Lieut. Dow, the recruiting officer with two sons at the front, also gave an address.

The luncheon and afternoon tea raised £40.
