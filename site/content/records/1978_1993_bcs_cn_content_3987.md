Morphett’s Pump House and Winding House (Burra Mine)

The Burra Burra DC has established a sub-committee to launch an appeal for $500,000 to offset costs associated with the restoration of Morphett’s Pump House and Winding House and a partial restoration of Morphett’s Shaft.  A brochure outlining the program will be prepared and major companies, particularly mining companies across Australia will be canvassed.  As 1981 is the centenary of the birth of Essington Lewis, former head of BHP, it was thought appropriate to approach companies like BHP to assist in the preservation of Burra’s mining heritage.
