Pam Marlow has carried out the initial work on the Jubilee Project to build a scale model of the Burra Mine to be housed in the Bon Accord Mining Museum.  The module of Morphett’s Enginehouse, boiler house and capstan has been on display in Bence’s window.  This is one of 33 groups of buildings which will slot into the landscape model, which is about 5 metres by 6.5 metres in area.  It will provide a picture of how the mine looked in about 1860.  The landscape is planned for completion in May and the glazing of the display is due to be done in September, ahead of the museum’s opening in October.  Pam and Phil Marlow and children have recently moved to Pinaroo, so on site work will be limited to school holidays.  Pam will continue to work on the models at her new home.  Many others have contributed to the huge task, especially Brian Salter and Peter Stitt.
