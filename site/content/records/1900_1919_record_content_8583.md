Burra Town Council, 5 October.

Reply received from Hindmarsh Council re streetlights that Kitson and Lux lights were splendid, but too dear.  Matter of street lighting to stand over.

Burra Waterworks.  Mr Sedgman has tested the small boiler to 90 lb and found it satisfactory.  The Cornish boiler is being cleaned and repaired.  It was decided to pay the Hydraulic Engineer’s account and sign the lease.  A cheque for £162-1-11 is being forwarded.

Burra Electro-Magnetic Works have ceased to operate and it is not known whether the process of treating the old dumps will be proceeded with.  J.F. Martin was in Burra last week and it is rumoured tenders will be called to unwater the Mine Pool to allow more tributers to work.
