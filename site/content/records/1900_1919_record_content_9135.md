Characteristics of the paper for 1903

Page 1

An unchanged mixture of large advertisements both local and other.

Page 2

Smaller advertisements, sales advice and public notices.

News is mixed with news-like advertising in long wordy articles.  Serial here or page 3.

Page 3

Two or more columns of large advertisements: not local.

News continues to be mixed with the wordy advertising and sometimes the smaller advertisements and sales notices more usually associated with page 2.

Page 4

Larger advertisements both local and patent cures etc.

In general the paper carried a patchy coverage of local news and there is a lot of padding with humour, items presumed to be of general interest and gossip from Adelaide and elsewhere.
