The Mayor said if the rate of interest comes down the Council had almost decided to continue with the waterworks and if it did not to hand them to the Government.

The concession was worth c. £169 p.a. and that would enable them to make the works pay.  The meeting resolved as previously reported to advise the surrender of the lease if the concession was not granted.
