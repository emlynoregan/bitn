Political Meeting at Kooringa

On Friday 16 March a public meeting at Kooringa to hear of the views of Messrs Dale, Lennon & Cole; candidates in the forthcoming election.  Mr James Wright of Clare was the Chairman.  He referred to a dispute between Mr Lennon and Mr Gleeson in which Mr Lennon had said people in Clare had applied in vain for land to be surveyed and put up for auction.  Mr Wright said he knew that none had been put up in the last 12 months that any middle-class man might bid for.

Mr Lennon repeated this.  In 12 months not an acre had been put up for sale west or north of Clare fit for either agriculture of mining.

Mr Dale said the dispute had arisen because Mr Kingston had said anyone could claim to have any portion of Crown Lands surveyed and put up for sale.  Mr Lennon had so applied without result.  Mr Gleeson had said land had been offered, but had not been taken up.

No questions came from the meeting and so Mr Cole was called to speak.

He advocated the cessation of immigration; his long term position and not a response to popular opinion lately arising.  He questioned the running of the Public Works Department and also asked why one of the judges did not visit Redruth for Circuit Sessions.  He sought action to reduce the operations of land sharks.  He supported free trade and free ports and direct taxation.  He supported education, thinking the Government should assist remote areas.  He favoured the payment of members.

The motion that Messrs Coles, Lennon & Dale were fit and proper candidates was passed without dissension.

An attempt to declare Dr Browne a fit and proper candidate was met with interruptions of contempt and derision and failed to gain support.
