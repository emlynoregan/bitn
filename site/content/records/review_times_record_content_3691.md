Christmas in Burra

Father Christmas will visit Market Square on Christmas Eve.  Publicity Officer for the Burra Traders’ Association Mrs G. Smedley said music was being played through a loud-speaker system in Burra and Christmas decorations are hanging in the streets.  Some shops have been painted in heritage colours.  Secretary Mrs Y. Barton said is was not compulsory for all shops to renovate in the same manner, but the idea was generally to blend the newer shops in with the older renovated ones.  The Burra Tourist Information Office, the Commercial Hotel and Sara’s Secondhand Shop have all been painted using heritage colours.  Mrs M. Wright, proprietor of Sara’s Secondhand Shop said the Heritage Branch of the Department of Heritage & Planning was acting as advisor to those wishing to renovate buildings in an authentic colour scheme.
