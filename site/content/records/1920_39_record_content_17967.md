Burra Town Council, 21 December

D. Jones asked permission to erect a hoarding 120ft long at the corner of the road near the Mine Bridge to be electrically lit.  Further particulars are to be sought.

Mr S.R. Oborn of the State School offers to grow trees for the Council from seed if the Council provides the seed.  The offer was accepted.

The main road work has reduced funds to Â£138 and an overdraft will have to be arranged till rates begin to come in during March.

The Finance Committee recommended a rate of 2/9.

Cr Kellaway moved the adoption of the recommendation.  Motion carried.

Cr Riggs thought there ought to be a separate Health Rate, but his motion lapsed.

[The idea of not specifying separate rates was to enable funds to be moved from one area of need to another as required.]

Cr Riggs gave notice of a motion to rescind the [rate] motion at the next meeting.

The services of J.J. Parker as ranger were dispensed with, as there was no longer any pound.
