Cr Rabbich objected to the south side as it would interfere with Mr Lockyer.

Cr Sampson would yield on the every chain instead of half chain, but wanted the paving of the street corner done properly.

Cr Rabbich wanted suspension of standing orders to reconsider the issue with Bagot, Shakes & Lewis.

Cr Sampson refused and moved that if Mr Lewis is prepared to pitch pave at every chain 6’, 8’ and 10’ at the end [Meaning unclear], the work to be commenced at once, he would support it.

After some confusing discussion Cr Rabbich moved that consideration of the correspondence re the drain from Bagot, Shakes & Lewis be adjourned and this was carried.
