Burra Sports

First Day

A race was organised on 13 November at the course two miles from Burra.  The terms were for £10 a side, one 1½ mile heat and gentlemen riders.

The horses were Mr Humphrey’s br. g. Parson and Mr Hotchin’s bay mare Bride.

Bride, won with ease, though the bets were two to one on Parson.

In a second race there were nine competitors for a handsome saddle valued at £7-10-0.

The first heat was won by Mr Hill’s Will o’ the Wisp and the second heat ended in a dead heat between Will o’ the Wisp and Mr Symons’ grey mare Cherry.  In the third heat Cherry won by half a head.  Cherry beat Will o’ the Wisp in the fourth heat.

After the above came a £5 match between Mr Ware’s Ginger and Will o’ the Wisp in which Ginger won by a length.

Then came a race for a new saddle worth £5, which was won by Mr T. Wright’s Charley.

The meeting closed with a Hurry-Scurry involving 12 horses.  The winner was Ginger.

Second Day

A boxing match was held between Jemmy Dunn, a Burra miner and John Jones, a Sydney native.  It was a match for £10 a-side.  Minute time was agreed on and 16 rounds were fought.

The match went to Jemmy Dunn.

A £5 a-side match followed between John Fortune (black Jack) and Tom Kelly (Snob) near Bunce’s Shaft.  They fought 31 half-minute rounds.  After about 45 minutes the match was decided in favour of ‘Jackey the Black’ to the deafening cheers of the assembled hundreds.

It is rare and remarkable that neither pugilist drew blood.
