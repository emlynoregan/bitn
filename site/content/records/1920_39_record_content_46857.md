Burra Rifle Club held its AGM in the Cheer-up Hall on Saturday to receive the 26th Annual Report by Captain J.A. Riggs.  The year ended with the club in credit c. £39.  The open shoot on 13 October had raised £2-14-6 for the Limbless soldiers’ Fund.  A letter had been received from Major Prisk, staff-officer of Rifle Clubs offering the club the shed on the old military rifle range on condition the club removed and re-erected it at their own expense.  As a consequence their shelter shed had been well extended thanks to permission from Messrs Warnes & Sons, owners of the land.  New rifles will be issued on 30 October next.  Prizes for the year:

Championship	H.H. Byles

Jennison Trophy	C.W. Pearce

Marksman’s Trophy	A.C. Aughey

Fearon Cup 	F. Spencer	(For highest points in 1st 10 matches.)

Handicap Championship	J.E. Pearce – corrected in the paper of 19 July to J.A. Riggs.
