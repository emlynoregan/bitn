Mr S. Dawson for the middle road:

The distance was less

More agricultural land would be opened up

The supply of both materials and water on the route was as good as on the Tothill’s Creek line.

He said he favoured route 6.

Mr Rounsevell said he had travelled the routes for 17 years and favoured No. 1.

Mr J.E. Miller supported the middle road.

Mr Harris spoke for Tothill’s Creek Road.

A decision was deferred.
