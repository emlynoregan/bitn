Burra Boy Scouts.  Report of the 1st Annual Social.

Mr Rigney reported on the yearâ€™s work.  The troop started with 18 and now numbers 40.  They started out with the use of part of the old White Hart Hotel until it burnt down and now they are using a nice large room at the Waterworks, courtesy of Mr Sedgman, who obtained permission from the Commissioner.  Camps were held at Aberdeen Oval in November, at Princess Royal at New Year, with permission from Mr Tennant and at The Forest with the permission of Mr Cock.

Other activities are reported.
