A viaduct has been erected from the heap to the cracker and the wagon which carries 1 ton is drawn up by machinery, tipped and returned to the heap.  The Martin’s cracker was made for the Dry Creek Smelting Works, but was too small for that.  At present they are crushing 25 tons in 8 hours, but they will soon double that when extra shifts are put on.  The crusher weighs 8 tons and has rollers 23” in diameter and 18” long and having passed through the cracker the slag enters the crusher and is ground very small and is passed through a six-hole sieve.  Stuff failing to pass through is returned to the crusher.  From the crusher it passes to the jigger, 20’ long and moving at 150 strokes per minute.  The jigger has six compartments which sorts the copper from the residue.  An elevated tramline will take the tailings away from the jigger.  The water comes from the Burra Waterworks at 2/- per 1,000 gallons.  It is recovered from the process and recycled.  The staff is currently seven men, but two shifts will soon be used, more than doubling the workforce.
