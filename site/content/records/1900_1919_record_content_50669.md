St Andrew’s Church, Mt Bryan.  On 23 May two new windows made by Messrs Powell & Sons of London were dedicated in the chancel.  The service was conducted by Right Reverend Bishop Wilson & Rev. S.J. Bloyd and a large congregation was assembled.  On the north side the window represents St Andrew and the lad with five barley loaves and two small fishes with some of the 5,000 on the shores of the Sea of Galilee.  It was given by Mrs Hatherly and her children in memory of the late John Hatherly and unveiled by Mr Herbert Hatherly.  The southern window shows the child Samuel with a Guardian Angel.  It was given by Miss Young of Glenelg in memory of Andrew Barker Hooper, infant son of Mr & Mrs Andrew Hooper, now of Salisbury and Mr Hooper unveiled it.
