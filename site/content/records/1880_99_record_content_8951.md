The supplements comprised a single broadsheet page of seven columns of small print.  The poetry was quite limited and the prose each week would have provided a good deal of reading ranging over a wide variety of topics.

The titles of the serialised novels give a sufficient hint as to their contents.  They are generally romances of a most melodramatic sort.
