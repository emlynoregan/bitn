Burra Burra Hospital

Elections for the Board resulted in the return of the old members Messrs Kellaway, Woollacott & Morgan.  During the election campaign Rev. Lawson, one of the candidates, had used an advertisement implying that the Hospital Board had a policy of not employing local girls as nurses.

The Board interviewed the late Chairman W.G. Hawkes who left them with the impression that such was departmental policy and they inserted this in the paper and said it was to preserve the patients’ privacy.  Mr Lawson approached the Board last Friday with the threat of legal proceedings unless they distributed printed leaflets withdrawing this statement.  Rev. Lawson had sent a telegram asking the Chief-Secretary if such was in fact departmental policy and if so whether it was also Government policy.  The reply was that no such instructions had been sent and it was neither departmental nor Government policy.  The editor publishes the text of both telegrams and apologises.

W.G. Hawkes also wrote a letter saying that the paper was justified in saying that they got the impression from him that the non-employment of local girls as probationers was a rule of the department.  It has never been laid down as such by the Chief-Secretary, Inspector General of Hospitals or the Hospital Association.  It is a rule made by the local Board of Management in common with many others formulated by the Board for the good management of the Institution.  The office of the Inspector-General of Hospitals, frequently referred to as ‘The Department’ was aware of the rule and has approved of it.

Harrold Button said that Rev. Lawson had complained that it was unfair to have his letter published too late for a reply.  In return Button asks why Lawson published his advertisement only the week before.  In fact Button’s letter was written on Tuesday 24 June and handed in for publication that week, but space prevented its inclusion that week.  He apologises for thinking Rev. Lawson was leaving in April when clergy are usually asked to extend their term.
