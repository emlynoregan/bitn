Thomas Clark, teamster of Kooringa, said he had been cutting chaff on Wednesday afternoon and had left at 5.30 p.m. and had not seen the place until he was told it was alight.  The roof was alight when he got there and fell in about half an hour later.  Neither he nor his man smoked there.  The place contained five tons of hay, 20 or 30 empty bags, various tools and a new chaffcutter.  The hay was perfectly dry.  His stepson fed the horses about 10 o’clock.  He suspected arson, but did not suspect anyone.  The place was uninsured.  The end of the building near the yards was made of upright dry mallee sticks and the walls were of stone.

Thomas Bewley, labourer, said he had been cutting chaff on Wednesday and left between 5 & 6 when everything was alright.  He always went into the house to smoke.  Benjamin Newman, teamster and stepson of Mr Clark, confirmed feeding the horses and said he carried a close glass lantern and did not set it down, but let it swing from a rafter about 4 ft 6 inches from the paling roof.  His mother woke him about 2.15 a.m. to say the shed was on fire.  Two thirds of the shed was alight.  He too believed the cause was arson, but had no suspects.

John Shortridge, clerk, said he saw no sign of fire when he passed the premises about 1.30 a.m.  He was not smoking.  Elizabeth Shortridge said she passed Mr Clark’s about 1 a.m. and saw no sign of fire.  After her son came home she heard a person run past the house and went out, thinking it some person at the wood, as some had been stolen lately. She saw someone cross the bridge and run along the road as fast as he could towards the cemetery.  The alarm about the fire was raised about 20 minutes later.  The person running was either in shirt sleeves or a light coat and he came from the same road as Mr Clark’s and not from the Grammar School.

William Young, grocer’s assistant, said that at about 2.20 a.m. on Thursday morning he was standing opposite Mr Batchelor’s premises in Commercial Street with T. Shortridge Jnr when he saw the fire break out.  They ran as fast as they could, calling out- Fire!  The shed appeared to be all ablaze.  Woke Mr Clark and family.  There was no chance of putting out the fire.  He had been standing in Commercial Street for about ten minutes and the only person he saw was J. Beaglehole going for Dr Nesbitt.

The jury found it impossible to determine whether the fire was the result of an accident or the work of an incendiary.
