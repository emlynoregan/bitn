Burra Burra DC

Council is seeking to clean up the town with a campaign aimed at a general removal of rubbish, especially the removal of old car bodies from the area, the elimination of stray dogs and mosquito control.  Local Cubs and Scouts have held a Litterthon and collected 248 bags of rubbish.  They removed 1,457drink cans and 116 bottles in the town and from one mile of the road west.  The greatest source was the Burra Creek.
