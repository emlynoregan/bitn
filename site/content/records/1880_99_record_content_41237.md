Mr J.J. Duncan: He was 1st returned to the lower house 19 or 20 years ago.  He did not favour shorter terms for the L. Council, supported the present tax system and opposed the ideas of a single tax or a progressive land tax.  Favoured the honest buy back of good land, but not the many areas that were not suited for closer settlement.  He favoured workingmenâ€™s blocks.  Though he was opposed to cutting up more stock routes: those cut up near Burra had become nurseries for star thistles.  The transcontinental railway was a white elephant.  He opposed speculative railways and would not support a Blyth-Gladstone line.
