SA Mining Association.  (Editorial)

The affairs of the SA Mining Association have been so closely identified with the progress of the colony that although it is a private entity its operation claims the attention of all.  It affects hundreds of families directly and indirectly.  As a result the proposals now being put forward cause people to ask how it comes about that it should be reduced to ‘suffer a recovery’ rather than continue in its prosperous condition.

It appears from the Directors’ report and from the new scheme they are considering that they want to raise about £37,000 to carry on work at the 60 fathom level where there is said to be plenty of copper if they could get at it.

In order to raise the money they propose to dissolve the Company and reorganise it.  Although it has been one of the richest associations in the world no reserve fund has been formed to meet an emergency and no adequate provision made to develop the mine as the workings became deeper.  The profits were simply distributed as fast as they were obtained.  Now the result is that although it still contains riches, the mine has been worked at a loss for want of sufficient means to develop it.

The value of the shares has fallen much below their worth according to the secretary.  This is to be expected if the mine is working at a loss and the proprietors were taking no steps to rectify that.  Perhaps new shares could have been issued while the mine was still making a profit and while the old shares still stood high in public estimation, but now it is too late to do that.

The proposal is to form a new company to be called the Burra Burra Mining Company Ltd with a capital of £300,000 in 60,000 shares of £5 each fully paid: 42,000 to be issued initially and 18,000 held in reserve if additional capital should be required.

Holders of the 2,464 shares in the SA Mining Association will be allotted 34,496 shares in Burra Burra Mining Co. Ltd fully paid up (equivalent to £172,480).  This values one share in the old company at 14 in the new.  The remaining 7,504 shares in the Burra Burra Mining co. are to be made available as follows:

Each of the old shareholders have the right to one £5 share in the new company (at par) for each share held in the SA Mining Association – say 2,464 shares.

3,000 are reserved for sale in England.

2040 plus any not claimed by present shareholders are to be offered to the public at par or the best premium obtainable.

This would give the company £37,520 plus an estimated £15,000 profit from unsold copper.

This proposal was approved at a general meeting of shareholders.  No profits are therefore presently declared, but the work of exploration will proceed according to the new scheme.
