The result has given staff greatly improved conditions.

The RSL has more comfortable facilities and the Ladiesâ€™ Auxiliary is better accommodated for indoor bowls.

Mr Max Amber said he was impressed with the outcome, which gives offices of a standard equal to any in the state.  Len Simpson represented the RSL and thanked the Council, saying that the RSL was very pleased with the refurbishment, which displays the honour boards in the main Council Chamber.
