Mt Bryan Victory Day Celebrations

About 140 partook of the High Tea.

There was a good fire in the Billiard Room and many men availed themselves of it and a game of billiards between tea and the start of the dance.  Others joined the fire in the Council Room.  Black Diamond Band began the dance at 8 p.m.  At 9 p.m. over 40 couples got up and did the Polonaise, led by Mr & Mrs Dan Seigert of Hallett.  A Victory Tableau was staged at 10 p.m.  [This is described in some detail.]

Nett proceeds of Â£27-2-7 were given to the Hall Committee to purchase an Honour Roll for the district.
