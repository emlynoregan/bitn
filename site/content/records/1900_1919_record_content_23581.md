Diamond Wedding.  Mr & Mrs Henry Pinch of Redruth are among the oldest residents in Burra and celebrated the 60th anniversary of their wedding last Wednesday.  They arrived in the Duke of Bedford in 1848 and came to Burra.  They were married in the old Church of England by Rev. Bagshaw on 17 February 1849.  The Kooringa Masonic Lodge, where Mr Pinch has been a member for 34 years, gave him a complimentary social on Wednesday at their hall.  W.M. Bro. C.A. Fuss presented an illuminated address.
