Burra Hospital Board, 28 November

It was decided to auction the old isolation ward.

It was decided the wards should be painted and other areas kalsomined.

It was resolved to take legal action to recover fees from two former patients.

Of the £1,000 placed on the Government estimates for the Isolation Ward £700 had been previously paid and a cheque for a further £200 had now been forwarded.

Four Board members had visited the Jamestown and Clare Hospitals to see how they ran, but concluded they had few advantages.  Clare’s buildings were scattered and did not accord with the Health Act, though they were very well kept.  There was no town water supply, which could be a problem.  They did care for children and they kept two cows to provide milk at a considerable saving.  Being newer buildings there were no problems with steps as there were at Burra.  Jamestown complained of the lack of interest shown by some members of their Board, which numbered 23.  Walls were oil-painted and washed down periodically.  They had a very useful portable X-ray machine.  Jamestown like Burra was all steps and stairs.  Clare was modern and its staff accommodation far superior and it had a washing machine and drying apparatus.
