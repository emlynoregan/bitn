Obituary.  William Wayman Mosey died at Robertstown aged 86.  This year he classed the clip from his 4,300 Merino sheep and continued to work from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m.  He lived at Brady Creek near Robertstown.  He was born at Scarborough, Yorkshire and came to Australia when 10.  He began working at Tanunda as a shepherd for 2/6 a week plus board.  He then looked after cows at Pt Gawler for 5/- a week.  Later he took the first mob of Merinos to Koonoona for Messrs Duffield & Barritt and worked there for three years.  He also spent time bullock driving carting wood to the Burra Mines and wool from the Burra District to Pt Wakefield.  Horses he said were then a luxury.  He also told of ploughing in the 1860s with a single furrow plough and hand broadcasting the grain.  Hay and barley were then reaped with a sickle and raked up with a hand rake.  With a scythe an acre a day was good work for which a labourer got 4/-.  When he got 32d a pound for wool in 1925 he recalled days when he had got 6d a pound and 1/6 a bushel for wheat.  He left a widow, eight sons and six daughters: Messrs Albert, W.H., George, Walter (NSW), A.L., Leslie, Percy [which is only 7], Mesdames Jenkins (Broken Hill), Reynolds, J. Farley, Miss Mosey, Miss Irene & Miss Alice.  Mrs H.G. Oates is a granddaughter.  [Died 16 December 1927.]
