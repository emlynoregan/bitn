Obituary.  Mr W.J. Woollacott of Hanson died at Burra Hospital last Wednesday night.  He was born at Burra North 22 November 1879 and was the oldest in a family of thirteen, the son of the late Mr & Mrs T.H. Woollacott.  He was educated at Burra School.  On leaving school he first worked for his father, but later took up farming and continued on the land until forced to retire due to failing health.  He spent all his life in the district, but due to indifferent health did not take part in any public duties.  He was closely connected with the Methodist Church and was a local preacher and church officer at Redruth and Hanson.  On 28 July 1915 he married Miss Mabella Duke, only child of  Mr & Mrs Duke of Hanson who survives with three children: Dorothy, Mrs Claude White of Porter’s Lagoon; Miss Melva Woollacott of the Education Department Hundred of Whyte and Mr William Woollacott of Whyalla.  Also six brothers:

Mr T.H. & Mr Stan Woollacott of Burra North

Rev. E.H. Woollacott

Messrs Arthur & Joe Woollacott of Adelaide

Rodney Woollacott of Essendon Grammar School

And one surviving sister, Bessie, Mrs Arthur P. Harris of Hawthorn, Victoria.

He was for many years a member of the Manchester Unity Lodge MUIOOF.
