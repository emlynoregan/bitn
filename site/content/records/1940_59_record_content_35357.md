Burra Air Force Association held its AGM on 31 January

The past year saw the Club decide to furnish and set up the Clubrooms now occupied by them.  With the aid of members the building was renovated, repainted and furnished.  On Anzac Day the Air Force Association marched as a body with the RSL and the Annual Ball on 6 June was opened by the State President, Wing Commander F.G. Huxley.  As a result of the ball the Association’s funds gained £50.  A service was conducted at the Memorial, with the Spalding Brass Band in attendance on 14 September, National Airforce Day.  During the year the branch has lost several members due to relocation: John Gall (Vice-President), Tom Secker (Treasurer) and Frank Lillecrapp.

Elected: President, John McBride; Vice-President, Maurice H. Woollacott; Secretary, J.A. Terry; Assistant Secretary, W.E.D. Young and Treasurer, K.L. Paltridge.
