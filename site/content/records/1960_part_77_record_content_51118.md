St Dymphna’s Church, Booborowie

Over 500 attended St Dymphna’s on Sunday 10 May for the opening of renovations to the church by His Lordship Bishop Brian Gallagher of Pt Pirie.  A luncheon in the Booborowie Hall followed the Mass.  Mr Harry Queen [Quinn?] Chairman of the Church Committee responsible for the work gave a talk outlining the history of the Catholic Community in Booborowie.  St Dymphna’s was blessed and opened on 20 September 1903 by Monsignor F. Byrne.  The Bishop spoke expressing his appreciation of the committee’s effort.
