Mr James H. Garrett visited Burra after an absence of sixty years.  He is now 84 and was visiting Mrs G. Green of Hanson.  He was born in the village of Laxey, Isle of Man, in 1852 and migrated to Australia in 1873.  After spending a week in Adelaide with Mr John Kelly (who later came to Burra) he came to Burra with letters of introduction to Captain John Roach.  His first job was quarrying stone at Hampton, working with a Mr Watkins, to build Roach’s Mill (now the Burra Roller Mills) and Butterworth’s Flour Mill – the latter has since been demolished.*  As Captain Roach was not in charge at the Mine on his arrival, he met Captain Saunders [Sanders].  When the Captain found out he was a relative of the Chief Engineer of the Great Laxey Silver Mine, who was an old friend of Captain Saunders, he gave him a job with an old miner named Roberts.  The couple worked in Peacock’s Shaft on Tribute.  Later he got a position with the Railways Department as an engine driver.  Except for two trips to England and the Continent, he carried on as an engine driver for the Railways until he retired aged 70.  He had been a friend of Mr William West, Thomas Bentley, David Wells, J.R. Gray, Rob & Mat. Birt and John Dunstan.  He admired the Soldiers’ Memorial in Market Square.

[James Henry Garrett married Alice Green 1885 at Gawler where the couple had three sons and two daughters.  Alice died in 1935 and James Henry died 26 July 1939.]

[*Butterworth’s Mill was closed and later bought by Henry Roach.  In 1926 he left Burra and the mill was sold to British Imperial Oil Co. who developed the site as the Shell Oil Depot.  (See XXXXVIII, 45, 17 Nov. 1926, Supplement.)  The mill was gutted and the top two floors removed for this conversion, but the stonework was not demolished and by the end of the century it had been redeveloped as a private home, becoming by 2010 the offices for Phoenix Copper Ltd: a copper exploration company.]
