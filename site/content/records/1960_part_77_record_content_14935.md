Tennis

‘A’ Grade	Spalding 16-109 defeated Hallett White 4-72

Booborowie 15-109 defeated Willalo 5-62

‘B’ Grade	Spalding Red 10-92 defeated Booborowie 10-84

Aberdeen 14-106 defeated Kooringa 6-68

Kooringa 13 sets defeated Aberdeen 7 sets

[The last two results would seem to be at odds unless they represent different days, but the same teams would not have met on consecutive occasions.]
