Burra Cheer-up Soc.

The Ladies’ band etc. assembled at the station on a wet and stormy Tuesday evening 6 April [sic] to welcome home Surgeon Major D. Steele.  [Since he is earlier said to have only reached Australia on 13 April, and then to have gone on to Brisbane, this date should probably be 6 May.]

Pte J. Roach returned on 9 May by the midday train and so was not accorded a welcome.

F.H. Collins, secretary of the Booborowie Cricket Club writes proclaiming their victory over Kooringa, rather than a draw as reported last issue.  The editor admits the paper’s error.
