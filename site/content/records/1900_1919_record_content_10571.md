Editorial on Benevolence.

The writer discusses the recent success in raising money for the Burra Benevolent Society, but also the need for it and the need to keep the aims of the society constantly before the public.  Half the world doesnâ€™t know how the other half lives and this is as true in Burra as anywhere.  There is also considerable unknown local charity, which is just as well or the responsibility of the Society would be of much larger dimensions.
