Burra Town Council, held a special meeting on Saturday, but failed to notify the press and so the report printed depends upon one of those present.

The Mayor said he considered the meeting informal.

Cr Sampson said they were met to consider the unemployment issue.  He was not at the last meeting when they agreed to pay 6/6 a day and he thought they should have made it 5/- and so employed 8 or 9 more men.  He asked for the payment to be changed to 5/- a day.

Cr Ridgway said they could not discharge the men or change what was now in place without a week’s notice as they were engaged till 1 January at 6/6 a day.  To do as Cr Sampson wanted would be a breach of faith.

The Mayor ruled he could not entertain Cr Sampson’s motion.

Cr Sampson wanted to know if Council consented to the reduction and was 2nd by Cr Symons.

The Mayor said that before that the previous motion would have to be rescinded.  [And this required notice.]

The mayor reminded Councillors of the 15-man limit per Ward.

Crs Coglin and Ridgway had not exceeded it.  Crs Sampson & Symons had.

In the end no resolution was put.
