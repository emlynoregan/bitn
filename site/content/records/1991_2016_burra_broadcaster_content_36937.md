Kooringa Hotel.  Licensees Linda Peressin & Matt Thorne have big plans for the hotel.  Although they have been here for only about four weeks, they have already opened an additional public area â€“ suitable for meetings and seminars.  A private function lounge and dining room is on the drawing board and will open soon.  Linda is also planning Murder Mystery evenings.
