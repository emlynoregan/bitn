The Mt Bryan Railway Crossing.  This has been a concern for some time.  At present there are two crossings, one at the north end and one at the south.  The problem has been that people from the east have to use the northern crossing and then come south to use the southern crossing to gain access to the station or other parts of the town.  Goods trains often block the southern crossing while loading and unloading and people have to wait for 30 or 45 minutes.  There was a proposal for a crossing in the middle and to close the northern one, but the District Council and residents opposed that.  Lately there has been a proposal for a road on the eastern side of the line to enable resident from the east to reach the town without crossing the line.  While the Highways and Railways Departments considers this proposal the District Council has accepted the offer from T.J. & W.H. Quinn to sell them a strip of land one chain wide along the railway line adjoining sections 185 & 186 in the Hundred of Kingston, to enable the construction of the road.  Locals have donated fencing.
