Fire.  On Friday 26 November a fire started on Walter Hawker’s property at Booborowie.  A wind change luckily allowed it to be put out quickly.  The Spalding District is well organised with beaters, water-carts and a splendid organisation.

Booborowie has a fire cart, but no organisation.  It is time something was done.
