Burra Town Council

The bridge at the rear of the Burra Hotel is to be attended to.

Tenders called for the lighting of street lamps as in 1898.

W. Davey has resigned as Town Clerk due to ill health and his resignation was accepted with reluctance.  ‘The Mayor and councillors spoke in the most eulogistic terms and passed the highest encomiums [sic] on Mr Davey.’

Mr R. Thomas wrote to say he could not continue as both curator of the cemetery and overseer of works, but was willing to continue as curator if it could be arranged.

Burra Waterworks.  In reply to a letter the Commissioner of Crown Lands was willing to extend the lease at 4% until a settlement of the situation is arrived at.

Cycling.  The holiday cycling events provided amusement for 175,000 people at an average of 1/3 per head, amounting to £10,937-10-0.  Prizes took £2,150, giving a surplus of £8,787-10-0 or say £7,500 after working expenses, advertising etc.
