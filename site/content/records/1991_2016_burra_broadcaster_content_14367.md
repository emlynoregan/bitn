Burra Golf Club

The club was unable to secure a Department of Recreation and Sport grant and has been looking at alternative ways to fund new greens.  A proposal was carefully developed and presented to Goyder Council and supported in person by Craig Wilson CEO of the Mid North Regional Development Board, Michael Vigor of Virginia Irrigation and the Australian Sales Manager of Hardie-Toro.  Council is to vote on the proposal in November, having decided to get an independent financial viability study done by a person with golf course design expertise.  The Gold Club is required to obtain guarantors for $100,000 of the total loan obligation of $170,000 and it appealing for such to come forward from community members and businesses.
