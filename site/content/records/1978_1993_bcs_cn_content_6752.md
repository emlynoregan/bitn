Its early activities can be gauged from a report for 1900

Relief was granted to 25 aged men and widows and 11 families of 28 members.

Total orders granted were 478, 340 being for firewood, 120 for groceries and 18 for drapery.

In 1977 it was renamed The Burra Community Aid Society to align better with the area it was serving.

It spends $500 to $700 p.a. derived from capital invested.

Recently it has aided in clothing, foodstuffs and financial support at funerals and has helped Burra Community Library acquire large print books.

Chairman, Rev. David Thiem; Secretary, Reta Jennison & Treasurer, Rev. Brian Polkinghorne.
