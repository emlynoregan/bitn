Burra Town Council, 2 February

The Town Clerk reported on progress with the books of the Corporation.

Treasury wrote from Adelaide about the Local Public Works Scheme and payments made to Council under that scheme.

The scheme had its origins in the 1930s when, in order to relieve unemployment, the Commonwealth and State Governments invited local Government to submit proposals for work to be financed from loans and undertook to pay to those local authorities two-thirds of such amounts as were required to amortise such loans over a ten year period.

Burra Council submitted a proposal to improve Victoria Park at a cost of £400, but due to the outbreak of war no start was made.

After the war the matter was revived in 1946 and after some consideration about changing the proposal to the swimming pool, Treasury was advised by a letter dated 24 July 1946 from the Town Clerk that the Corporation would continue with the original proposal to beautify Victoria Park.  The Commonwealth Government’s approval was obtained and Council was advised that it could proceed, by a letter dated 16 October 1947.

In July 1948 the Council sought to amend the proposals to cover a project costing £1,200 – still in relation to the Recreation Ground [Victoria Park].  It was advised that it could do so if it wished, but the two other Governments’ contributions would remain as much as would amortise £400 of the amount borrowed.

In November 1950 a letter from Council advised that work had been completed, along with an accompanying financial statement signed by the then Mayor, the President of the Burra & District War Memorial Committee and the Town Clerk.  Receipts totalling £800 were forwarded for the contractor F.L. Hogan of Booborowie.

As a consequence half-yearly payments of £15-16-5, being ⅔ of the amount needed to amortise a loan of £400 at 3⅜% p.a. commenced on 17 May 1951 and have continued to be paid each half year since.  (Schedule enclosed.)

An agreement was received from the Fire brigade Board for signature concerning the tenancy and tenders for additions and alterations to the Fire Station.

The SA Government Tourist Bureau forwarded £385 for the swimming pool.
