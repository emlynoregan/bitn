Northern Fire Fighting Association.  Meeting at Gladstone on 26 April.

Mr R.J. Rose, Hon. Sec., said a number of Councils took no interest in fire fighting and amendments to the Bush Fires Act to compel attention are necessary.  Some delegates did not agree with proposals involving compulsion while others said only Acts with compulsory clauses were enforced.  Mr Rose said the proposed Board would not be a City or Central Board.  He believed anything short of compulsion would not place fire fighting on a proper basis.  Further consideration was deferred for six months.
