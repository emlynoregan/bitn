Burra Creek Wines are currently promoting their product in the USA.  They presently make wine from 30 acres of dry grown Cabernet and Shiraz vines.  A representative attended the Winter Fancy Foods Show in San Diego from 13-15 January.  Oprah Winfrey’s chef’s restaurant, Table 52, was next on the list.  The restaurant already sells Burra’s Princess Royal Sparkling Shiraz.  A visit to New York will follow.  Burra Wines have a distributor in Chicago.
