The procession left the Institute at 2 p.m. with District Councillors, Hallett Band, school children & decorated vehicles, including Drew & Crewes trolly with a gallows on it and the Kaiser hanged by the neck in effigy.  At the sports ground there were speeches by Mr Richards, Chairman of the DC, Rev. I’Anson & Cr McDonald.
