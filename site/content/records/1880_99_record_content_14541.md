‘Onlooker’ writes re some of the matters recently prominent in Clare and on Miss Campbell’s visit.  Also the railway workers are now to pay 1/- a room rent instead of 1/6.  This remains unfair, but may correct itself if no one comes forth to work for the Government under such circumstances.  While the workers are charged like this why are there so many hangers-on with good salaries - inspectors and their assistants and the like.  Such are too well paid for too little work.  Perhaps ministers intend to economise by cutting their own salaries.  The Burra Councillors have decided to economise on trees and while saving money is good this seems rather mean for such a trifle when the Mayor has raised so much.
