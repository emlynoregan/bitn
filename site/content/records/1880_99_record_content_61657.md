The Holidays

Christmas Eve

Trumpets and a thousand and one other musical (?) instruments greeted Christmas in the afternoon of the 24th.  The weather was fine, but the crowd was smaller than in previous years, despite which businessmen did a good trade till well past normal closing.  The Burra Band enlivened proceedings.  Boys threw coloured matches about, which threatened to cause horses to bolt and one such was only narrowly averted through prompt action.  Hotels did a good trade without incident.  Stores were decorated.

Christmas Day came in quietly and celebrations were confined to home and the usual picnic places.

Numerous picnic parties went to the Lagoon and Princess Royal on Monday, when there was rain at intervals.

Kooringa Primitive Methodist Sunday School celebrated its anniversary on Christmas Day with a public tea.

United Burra Friendly Societies’ Boxing Day Sports on the Burra Oval were a success financially and otherwise.  They were well patronised in good weather for the morning, though rain threatened later.  The strong morning wind subsided later.  The procession left the Institute about 10 a.m. headed by the Burra Brass Band.  This year the Maiden Race was scrapped in favour of one for Allcomers.  Results are printed.

The evening concert was fairly well attended.

Numerous picnic parties went to the Lagoon and Princess Royal.

The New Year

Kooringa Wesleyan Church held a Watch Night Service on New Year’s Eve that was well attended.  The New Year was greeted with guns and whistles.  There was no great hooliganism, though a few footbridges were upset and some gates and vehicles removed.  No great damage was done, though one pedestrian was tripped up by a gate left across a footpath.

Several shops were open to 9 p.m. on New Year’s Eve.
