B.H. Rogers of 18 Paxton Terrace writes querying the District Clerk’s observation that ‘at any given time he expects opposition from half the Ratepayers.’  This is the Rule he said.  Mr Rogers wonders where the rule is inscribed and he reminds everyone that the right to criticise or applaud elected members is a privilege of democratic society.
