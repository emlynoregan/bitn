Jailhouse Rock 2000

After a very successful inaugural event this year, the second one is planned for February 25-27, 2000.  Plans include a current release movie on Friday night, Paul O’Bryan’s Band at the Burra Hotel, a Rock ʼn’ Roll demonstration in Market Square and the main event at Redruth Gaol at 7.30 p.m. Saturday night with the band ‘Rockin’ the Jukebox’ and a relaxing brunch by the creek on Sunday morning.
