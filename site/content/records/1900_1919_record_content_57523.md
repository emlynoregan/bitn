PEACE Celebrations continued last Thursday.

Mt Bryan.  Thursday was a school holiday.  The children were given lunch in the Hall.  Then there was a procession around the town and a joyous meeting in the Hall.  Chair was I.J. Warnes, Chairman of the DC.  Mr Warnes gave a speech hoping that ‘The Great War would be the last war’ and urging all to continue to support the fighting men when they returned.  He also praised the patriotism of the area that had subscribed £21,800 to the 7th War Loan when the target had been £5,000.  He expressed concern though about returned men without experience being put on the land; many would not be in good health.  He feared many would not succeed.  He called for understanding and support for those who would return with poor health and in many cases with shattered nerves.

Mr Crewes spoke after Mr Warnes, seeing God’s hand in the victory.

Mr Warnes said he felt a statue of some sort with the names of those who had gone should be erected in Mt Bryan and he would subscribe 25 guineas towards it.

Hallett

On hearing news of peace a strong committee was formed and a procession and sports on the oval was organised for Thursday with a concert and dance to follow.  The procession left the Institute at 2 p.m. with District Councillors, Hallett Band, school children & decorated vehicles, including Drew & Crewes trolly with a gallows on it and the Kaiser hanged by the neck in effigy.  At the sports ground there were speeches by Mr Richards, Chairman of the DC, Rev. I’Anson & Cr McDonald.

The sports results are printed.

Burra

Celebrations continued on Thursday afternoon when the united bands turned out and speeches were made and a good time had generally.  Mr E. Cock hoped rumours of the Crown Prince’s death were true and the Kaiser with him.

Rev. D.B. Bridgwood was heartily tired of hearing ministers speak, but went on to give an address praising the allies for their honourable conduct in the war, compared with German atrocities.

Captain Trigg spoke also of the joy of victory, but scarcely knew whether to rejoice at rumour of the Crown Prince’s death as death was too good for him.

Sgt Harvey Sweeney, a visitor from Victoria, spoke of the ongoing need for support that returning men would need.  In the evening there was a concert in the open air and among contributors were returned men Sgt Swanson, Cpl Burgess & Driver Darmody.
