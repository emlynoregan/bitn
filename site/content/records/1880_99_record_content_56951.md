J. Lewis wrote concerning the work in Ware St.  He says the road was all that was required, but after the work the approach to his back entrance is spoiled and left in a dangerous condition.

The kerbing on the side next his wall was far too high.

The kerbing is taken too far south, making the approach to and from his back yard dangerous, especially at night.

A quantity of stuff was left on the footpath against his wall, tending to destroy it and spoiling the footpath.

The crown of the road has been raised to an unnecessary extent making it almost impossible for a heavily loaded wagon or dray to travel over it and difficult to get out of his yard.

Some loose stones are left on the part of the work uncovered.

The entrance for floodwater to the culvert is left in a dangerous state.

Had a few pounds been expended in repairing the road and paths in Kangaroo St it would have been more judiciously used.

The footpath near his schoolroom he says also needed attention.  Last winter there was a pool of water there, quite 4” deep for over a week after rains.  There are other places in West Ward where money could have been spent to greater advantage.

The Mayor saw no disrespect in the letter, but Crs Hardy & Parks certainly did and did not want to receive it, but eventually agreed as Cr Parks said ‘We can receive it and take no further notice of it.’

Cr Sampson objected to the passing of the pay-sheet, as it included amounts for work not authorised by the Council.  He objected to work done in Ellen Terrace [Helen Terrace], gravel near Mr Bentley’s and work near Mr Bartholomæus’.

Crs Rabbich and Parks interjected.

Cr Rabbich said several small jobs were ordered by Council and those done were included and the money expended was well spent.

Cr West asked who ordered the work.

Cr Hardy said that near Bentley’s was ordered when the stonework in the creek was done and that near Bartholomæus’ was ordered last council meeting and the Ellen Terrace work some time ago.

Cr Sampson called for the order to be shown in the book.

After further discussion the pay-sheet was passed.

The Public Works Report was then given by the Chairman, verbally.  Cr Rabbich moved it be received.  Cr Parks 2nd.

Cr Sampson objected to the report.

Cr Hardy said it was a statement and he didn’t care if it was received or not.

Cr Sampson said it didn’t include all the work done.  He gave them credit for more.

Cr Rabbich said Cr Sampson’s statement was false.

Cr Sampson called for a withdrawal.

Cr Rabbich withdrew ‘false’ and tried to substitute ‘not correct’, but the Mayor disallowed any substitution.

Cr Sampson said the statement was so mixed that one did not know if the work had been done in Burra or Gawler, but on looking at the pay-sheet we find it was done near Bentley’s etc.

Earlier Cr Rabbich had objected to being called a gentleman and now when Cr Sampson referred to Cr Rabbich and Mr Hardy, it was Cr Hardy that objected to the ‘Mr’.

Cr Sampson said ‘Oh well I’ll say councillor.  If the pair can go on ordering work they should pay for it out of their own pockets and who is Hardy – ’

Cr Hardy again objected and Cr Sampson amended it to ‘Mr Councillor Hardy’.
