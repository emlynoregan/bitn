Visitors.  Harry & Will Batchelor whose father came to Burra in 1854 and was a member of Burra Town Council.  [Middle Ward Dec. 1877-Nov. 1881]  He was the instigator of tree-planting and met with opposition.  The first trees were planted in Queen St.  The two-storey building now occupied by R.D. Pascoe was built by Mr Batchelor in 1860 and was the first house built in Burra [sic: meaning Kooringa] on freehold property.

[I would not accept the assertion regarding trees without other evidence and the statement of freehold property needs further information, as SAMA did not resolve to sell freehold in Kooringa till 1869.]
