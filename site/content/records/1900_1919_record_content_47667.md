Burra Show Society met on Friday in the Liberal Union Rooms.  For probably the first time a number of ladies attended.  Mr Winnall moved to make the decision of the meeting binding on the General Committee with respect to the sales of intoxicants at the 1916 show.  He linked a vote of no to the loyalty of the members.  This produced uproar and cries of ‘Sit down’ and ‘Wowser’.  He alleged that alcohol was as big an enemy to Britain as Germany, which provoked laughter.  The vote in favour of a publican’s booth was 123 for and 54 against.
