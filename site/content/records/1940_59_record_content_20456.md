Mr H. Wilson, Burra Town Council Overseer has completed his 30th year of employment with the Council.  When he started he was curator of the cemetery and became overseer on the retirement of the late J. Rosewall, some 16 years ago.  Whilst curator he handled 1,107 burials.

[This seems rather a high figure for a period of 16 years and needs verifying.]
