Letter.  Bob Skinner writes to query the usefulness of a traffic counter on Kooringa Road – given that in two months traffic is to be diverted to enable sealing of the Burra-Morgan Road.  He also wonders whether the sealing of Kooringa Road is worth the cost – couldn’t people easily come in from the north via Young Street?  Visitors would get an exciting view of Burra’s attractions.
