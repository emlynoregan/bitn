Burra Town Council, 6 October

G.S. Hawker MP writes about the response of the Minister for Local Government on the Black Springs Road.

The Registrar General of Deeds writes to draw attention to a Government Gazette declaration changing the title to certain properties then registered under the SA Mining Assoc.  The Council held such property: Holder Garden in Chapel St and Drew Lane.

It was resolved to employ a permanent hand and to pay him a curatorâ€™s wage when a grave was to be dug, rather than to call tenders for a cemetery curator.
