Kooringa Court House, last Wednesday was densely packed to hear a charge of assault with intent etc. brought by a young girl of the age of 14, named Grace Dunstan against a man aged about 40 named John Williams.  The evidence is not fit to print, but the charge failed owing to the girl being contradicted in every particular of her evidence by the prisoner’s witnesses.  The Magistrate, in dismissing the case, advised the parties to get married as soon as possible.  This had not happened at the time of our latest intelligence.

[The registration of Marriages in SA records the marriage of John Williams aged 28 to Grace Dunstone aged 16 at the residence of Henry Dunstone in Kooringa on 22 July 1849.

Two children are registered to the couple; in 1853 and 1854 at Kensington.

The name is too common to trace with any confidence through Births and deaths records, but one death is suggestive.  John Williams died at Kensington 20 June 1855 when his age was given as 37.  Grace Williams aged 25 married Thomas Goldsworthy 5 February 1859 at the residence of her father, Henry Dunstan at Kensington.  This couple is recorded as having two sons and four daughters between 1859 and 1877 and the mother’s maiden name is then variously Dunston, Dunstan and Dunstone.  The 1859 child was born at Kooringa, the 1861 child at Kensington and the others at Moonta.]
