Mining Swindle [Editorial]

Some extracts from the London Mining Journal and an advertisement in the Times make reference to a pretended New Burra Burra Mine in this colony, which discloses one of the most nefarious transactions that has come to our notice for some time.  The location is not stated, but the report says there are rich bodies of proven ore a mile and a half long and 50 yards wide.  The advertisement in the Times is quite extraordinary and compares the supposed new find unfavourably with the Burra Burra Mine and in an attempt to throw dust in the eyes of the reader draws or suggests links between the two.

The whole thing appears to have its origin in a real discovery of Messrs Warren and Francis of Gawler and Mr Cave, formerly in the employ of Messrs Chambers and Co.  They discovered three mineral sections, Nos 1381, 1370 and 1544 some 200 miles north of Port Augusta, which they believe to be potentially valuable.  Mr Cave sent instructions to England for the sale of the property.  We are assured the property was properly represented and named using the native designation Yappoo.

It was to be sold as a bona fide mine with a view to the development of its treasures.  It seems however that it fell into the hands of improper parties who saw the possibilities for unjust and dishonourable speculation.  Alleged specimens were sent for analysis and the name was changed.  The most exaggerated descriptions were given of the property.  A company was started with 2,000 shares of Â£5 each and 1,600 were reserved for the proprietors, with 400 offered to the public.  The shrewd operators then appropriated the 1,600 shared reserved for the original discoverers.  We are assured that the London operators had not the slightest authority for any of these arrangements.  We can of course incur no responsibility for the explanations which have been given to us.  We simply state the facts as related to us.  We have reason to believe that the original proprietors are respectable gentlemen and believe they cannot in justice to themselves allow the matter to remain where it is.
