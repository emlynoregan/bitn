Burra RSL held its annual dinner at the clubrooms on Saturday night.  This coincided with the opening of the sub-branch 20 years ago.  [This is not a reference to the opening of the sub-branch, but to the opening of the new club rooms in what had originally been the SAFU store.  The sub-branch was actually formed on 10 August 1918 and before 1946 the clubrooms (from 1919) were located in the Eastern Telephone Syndicate Building on the south side of Commercial Street.]

About 60 members and visitors attended.
