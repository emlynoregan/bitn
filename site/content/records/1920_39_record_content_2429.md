Redruth Methodist Sunday School Anniversary 7 November with tea meeting on 8 November.  There were 151 scholars and 8 teachers.  Finances were healthy.  Mr Dunhill (Superintendent) spoke of the need for a larger and more up-to-date building.  Many years ago land was purchased and every month for five years collections have been made for the building fund.  Recently one of the church members promised to donate £ for £ up to £1,000 for the erection of the building.
