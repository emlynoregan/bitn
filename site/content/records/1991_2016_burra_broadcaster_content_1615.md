Country Roads need more funding.  The rubble route to Morgan needs to be sealed.  The Barrier Highway is narrow and while some sections have been remade, much is narrow and without a defining white line to mark its edge.  Even a short distance from Burra township to the Morgan Road is yet to be sealed.  Last Wednesday as an example of the difficulties a semi-trailer sank into the soft verge about ten km north of Manoora and only escaped turning over because the driver steered straight instead of trying to return to the sealed surface.
