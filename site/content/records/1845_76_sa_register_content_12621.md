Kooringa News, 19 September

Tuesday 15 September was the first anniversary of the Aberdeen Oddfellows Lodge MUIOOF.  The members met at the lodge room in Lamb’s Aberdeen hotel at 3 o’clock and preceded by the Kooringa Band marched through Kooringa to the Bible Christian Chapel, where Rev. Way gave a fine address on ‘Brotherly Love’.  A fine dinner followed at the Aberdeen Hotel.  [The toasts are reported.]  The lodge had spent six months getting organised and in the second six months 60 members had joined to bring the total to 100.  More than £77 had been paid to the District Office, sick brethren and other expenses and now they had £150 in hand.  No other lodge in the colony had made such progress and much was due to V.G. Corey, who had proposed by far the greatest number of members.
