Burra Town Council.

A.J. & P. McBride have offered to allow the Council to raise metal on the mine property free of charge, provided the site was kept fenced.

4-5 chains of the west wall of the cemetery are in need of repair.  To be done.

Cr Lane said that as there was a good balance in the account a bridge should be put in George St.  He said the bridge would require to be c. 88’ and he believed it could be done for £1 a foot.

Cr Killicoat thought the Aberdeen Bridge was needed more.

[This produced the usual north-south division on the two bridges.]

Estimates will be obtained.

Council will inspect to see what type of bridge is needed at the Mine Bridge.

V. Riggs writes, dated 26 March, of their train trip from Marseilles to near the Belgian border.

Cpl Bob Crewes writes, dated 27 March, from France, also of the trip from Egypt and the train journey north to the front.
