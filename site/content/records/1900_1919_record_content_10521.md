Thomas Parks came to SA in 1846 and worked for four years in Adelaide before coming to Burra with his wife and two children.  He married before he was 20.  Here he worked for Messrs Roach & Roscow as a baker for some time at a bakehouse close to O’Leary’s butcher shop in Queen St.  He then went to the Victorian goldfields, but was forced by ill health to return after only eight or nine weeks.  He then became a baker at the rear of John Snell’s premises and afterwards ran a grocery business for 38 years in the shop now occupied by Alf Bennett, working up a nice little business.  He raised five daughters and three sons: Mrs Dyer (Orroroo), Mrs Ware (Adelaide), Mrs T. Goldsworthy (Adelaide), Mrs A. Bennett (Burra), Mrs R.D. Pascoe (Burra), Thomas (Burra), George (Pt Pirie) & Charles (Burra).  He has built four nice cottages in Chapel St and bought another in Bridge St as competence for himself.  He is now living with his son-in-law Alf Bennett.
