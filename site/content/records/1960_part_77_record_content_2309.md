River Murray Water

The Government Public Works Committee took evidence at Burra Town Hall on Friday concerning the supply of water to Burra and districts further north, from the duplication of the Morgan-Whyalla Pipeline.  Representatives of Burra Town and District Councils gave evidence.  Mr Shannon MP chaired the meeting and outlines the project to supply water to Whyalla BHP Steel Works.

Part of the planning provided for large storages, the first of which is at Burra, from Hanson, planned for 1961.  Mr E.T. Baulderstone said that although Burra had a good water supply its quality was not suitable for hot water systems – especially at such places as the hospital.  Mr Shannon said that whether the supply would be all Murray water or a mixture of Murray and local water would be purely an economic decision; a shandy could be dearer than straight River Murray water.  If a shandy were chosen the ratio would be fixed.  Cr Ashby (Hallett DC) said Hallett, Whyte Yarcowie and Terowie had no permanent water supply.  Their elevation could prove troublesome and expensive.  He felt that a special rate to cover supply costs would probably be acceptable – though ratepayers had not yet been asked this.  The cost of carted water at Terowie was presently 25/- per 1,000 gallons.  Mr Shannon said landowners along the area within one mile either side of the pipeline would be rated whether they used the water or not.  Mr Shannon also thought that landowners a couple of miles away would not be denied access if they laid their own pipes.  Burra will definitely be supplied.
