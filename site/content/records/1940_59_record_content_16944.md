Obituary.  Mr Alfred Tavender Turner died 20 March at the Royal Adelaide Hospital aged 89.  He was better known as ‘Bill’ and was born in Geelong, Victoria, 6 July 1888.  [Sic: clearly this is incorrect and 1855 is more likely.]  In his youth he managed branches of the National Bank at South Broken Hill, Pt Augusta, Georgetown & Salisbury, being 11 years at the last named.  He was a keen athlete with particular aptitude in cricket and rowing.  He was a musician of note and an organist at the Church of England at Geraldton WA.  He married Miss M. Mally, [actually Lally not Mally] second daughter of the late Mr & Mrs Patrick Mally of Burra.  Late in life he left the bank and spent a good deal of time in the pastoral country to the east of Burra.  When 62 he walked from Redcliffe to Burra (c. 40 miles) to farewell his sons who were leaving for overseas with the AIF and he walked back the next day, taking 12 hours in either direction.  He is survived by a wife and children: Rose Mrs Forrest (Mordialloc, Victoria), Madge Mrs R. Pocock (Pt Adelaide), Gordon (Torrensville), and Doris Mrs Anderson (Sunbury, Victoria).  Two sons, Frank & Lawrence, predeceased him.  There are 12 grandchildren & 1 great-granddaughter.
