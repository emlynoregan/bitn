Burra Mine.  Burra Burra Copper Co. directors, T. Drew, & T.B. Gall with the secretary, V. Lawrence, inspected the Mine on Saturday.  They were met by J. Drew, W. West & Mr Pryor.  The directors returned to Adelaide by the afternoon train.  A bulk sample of 50 cwt of ore has been sent for experiment.  A half-yearly meeting of shareholders was held on Monday in Adelaide.  The directors reported expenditure of £1,015 on 690’ of drives, 264’ of cross-cuts, 61’ of rises and 60’ of sinking, comprising driving at Tinline’s and Gall’s Shafts, cross-cutting at Grave’s & Gall’s and sinking at the Hospital and Slaughterhouse Shafts.  Large quantities of milling ore had been found and from Gall’s Shaft 14 tons of marketable ore had realised £108.  Arrangements for testing the milling ore are in hand to determine how it can be treated.
