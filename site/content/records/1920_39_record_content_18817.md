Maurice Collins writes once more in reply to ‘Returned Soldier’ saying ‘if I am correctly informed by the little birds that whisper such things, you (in spite of the fact that you masquerade under the name “Returned Soldier”) do not know much more about smoke screens or gas attacks in actual warfare than I do.’

‘Your comrades would appreciate you being manly enough to sign your name.’
