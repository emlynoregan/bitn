Robberies at Aberdeen.  Several robberies have been reported recently at Aberdeen.  Fruit, cool drinks, lollies and tobacco were taken and more recently a box of cigarettes was taken from a case of groceries at the railway goods shed.  Several lads aged 7 to 12 were found responsible and were dealt with at a closed juvenile hearing yesterday.  They will be chastised by their parents who were ordered to pay the costs of the hearing.
