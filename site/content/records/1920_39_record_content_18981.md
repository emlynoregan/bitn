W. Hedley McWaters of World’s End has relied on a spring in a gully near the house.  In the present drought this dried up and recently his son found a patch of damp ground on a hilltop at the rear of the homestead.  At only five feet a stream of water was found capable of sustaining all the stock and the homestead.
