Obituary.  The sudden death of Mr Roy Jeffery commonly referred to by many as ‘The Master’ came as a shock.  He was the Headmaster of Burra High School 1954-58 and he and his wife Gwen soon became part of Burra.  Apart from the school, his greatest occupation during his term as Headmaster was the provision of a swimming pool.  At a meeting in March 1956 he moved the motion that called for a public pool to be built and managed by a community committee.  When it was passed he later became the secretary of the new committee.  In August 1956 excavation work started, but the River Murray floods at Renmark saw earth moving plant rushed there from Burra.  Mr Jeffery was involved in the money raising efforts for the pool – football matches, concerts, and amateur hours.  At the AGM in 1957 it was revealed that over £1,000 was available.  On 7 July that year the floor of the pool was completed and an application made for another grant of £1,500.  The pool walls were completed in November and the pool was fenced in January 1958.

The High School was reclassified in August 1958 and it seemed Mr Jeffery would be transferred.  Representations through the local MP, Mr Quirke, persuaded the Minister to leave him in place rill the end of the year.

Work at the pool went on, with a wading pool and surrounds to be completed and dressing sheds.  A further grant of £750 was received.  By 25 November 1958 the foundations for dressing sheds were down and work began on the walls.  A final push for funds ‘The Fiver Band’ raised £245 quickly and by 2 December reached £415 and it was hoped to open the pool before Christmas.  By 9 December there was £525 in the kitty and on 16 December £580.  At that stage Mr & Mrs Jeffery were being farewelled prior to their transfer to Clare, by numerous sporting and other bodies with which they had been associated.  A capacity crowd at speech night extolled the efforts of Mr Jeffery at the school in his five years there.  Mayor E.T. Baulderstone extended that praise to his efforts in the wider community and in particular to the swimming pool project.  The pool proved very popular in the summer of 1958-59, with takings averaging £20 per week.  It was also used for the Learn to Swim Campaign and many hundreds of young people have since learned to swim in the pool.  Despite being in use, it was decided to defer the official opening till the next season, when the buildings and surroundings would finally be completed.  Mr & Mrs Jeffery returned for the occasion when Mr G. Stanley Hawker performed the official act on 30 January 1960.  Mr Jeffery moved the vote of thanks to Mr Hawker.  He did not build the pool, but his enthusiasm was a major contributing factor towards the completion of the project free from debt and it can truly be said he left his mark in Burra.
