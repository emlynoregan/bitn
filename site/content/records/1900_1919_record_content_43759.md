Burra Show.  This turned out to be a brilliant success.  Despite the reduced prize money exhibits were good and attendance was also good in excellent weather.  The main difference seems to be the later date.  It is impossible to find a date that suits both farmers and pastoralists equally well.  Perhaps we could hold a sheep show in conjunction with the dog trials.  ‘The sideshows were numerous if not uplifting.’  The agricultural produce was not plentiful, but was of high quality.  Butter was particularly good and cattle and horses were of good quality.  Gate takings were £96-10-6 which was said to be a record.  Attendance was very large.
