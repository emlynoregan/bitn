Editorial on ‘Ourselves’

For some few weeks the Burra Record has been under new management.  The incoming proprietor is Mr Ernest F. Marston, late of The Leader, Numurkah, Victoria.  It is usual under such circumstances to make some announcements about policy.

We believe the large important and growing district will support a larger journal than the Record as presently issued.

This will take a little time as we become better acquainted with the area, establish networks and overcome mechanical difficulties.

Our ambition is to see, in each issue, a chronicle of the week’s happenings in the district.

The local paper should represent the whole district and not any sect or section and in reporting public matters we will have neither friends nor enemies.
