Mrs Joseph Richards late of Sutton Grange and now residing at ‘Boondara’ Croydon (Deaths CD suggests this was not in SA) was born 21 April 1833 at St Stythians Cornwall as Rose Knuckey and migrated in the William Mooney leaving Plymouth September 1848 and arriving at Pt Adelaide 1 January 1849.  Mrs Richards’ brother R.R. Knuckey came with the family and was later a surveyor connected with the Overland Telegraph to Darwin.  Mr Richards spent four years at the Burra Burra Copper Mines before going to the Victorian Goldfields in 1853.  They set out from the White Hart Hotel.  Mr Richards sailed to Melbourne and thence went to Castlemaine.  Mrs Richards still recalls interesting particulars of life on the diggings.  [Death not recorded in SA. One child born whilst in Burra: Roseanna Jane Richards 6 July 1852.]
