The Jubilee Trade Train is coming to Burra.  It is a major Jubilee 150 event.  It is a travelling showcase of our industrial expertise, innovations and achievements.  It is a series of exciting displays and demonstrations housed in a series of special exhibitions.  The railway station platform and surrounding area will form part of the display.  Local district and regional industries and promotions will be displayed and it is hoped local service groups will arrange stalls, entertainment, refreshments, etc.  It is hoped they will organise events to coincide with the exhibition, such as a period costume ball, street parades, foot and bicycle races etc.  It is therefore necessary that a co-ordinating committee be set up in Burra, where the train will arrive on 3 May 1986 and be open for inspection on 4 & 5 May, departing on 6 May.  Public Relations Officer for the Trade Train, Andre Willcox will be in Burra on 17 June 1985 to discuss the aims of the Trade Train Committee for May 1986.  Opportunities are almost limitless, so you are urged to attend this important meeting.
