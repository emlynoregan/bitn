Burra Hospital Nurses’ Quarters

The Hon. A.L. McEwin (Chief Secretary) and the Inspector general of Hospitals (Dr Jefferies) visited the Burra Hospital on Friday.  They met with the Board of Management before inspecting the Hospital.  The nurses’ quarters are uncomfortable, inconvenient and unsuitable.  The Board wishes to build new nurses’ quarters with the aid of the £2,000 legacy from the late Mr C. Gebhardt, assisted by a Government subsidy.  Everyone’s speeches are reported at length and a host of motherhood type statements were made.  The final outcome was that the Chief Secretary and the Inspector General went away promising a sympathetic hearing to the Board’s project.

Chaplain Donald Redding, a former Rector of St Mary’s Burra, has had a distinguished record of service with the AIF from the early days of the war.  He has now been awarded the MBE (Military Division) with the citation:

‘As one of the senior Chaplains, Chaplain Redding has been constantly amongst the forward medical posts and units attending the spiritual welfare of the sick and wounded.  By his personal example he has endeared himself to all.’
