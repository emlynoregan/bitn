The RSL AGM was held in the CWA Rooms on Saturday 19 January.  President M.T. Fuller presided.  League matters and the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen were discussed.  Elected: President, M.T. Fuller; Vice-Presidents; L.H. Thomas & M.G. Dobson; Secretary, A.L. Bence and Treasurer, Arthur Coverdale.

The President reported on an active and memorable year:

Parades were held for both V.E. Day and V.P. Day.  The Anzac March was held as usual with the Salvation Army Band from Adelaide.  Rev. H. Hobbs gave the address before a large assembly at the memorial.   There was an evening service by Rev. A.S. Barrett at Redruth Methodist Church.  Armistice Day was held on 11 November and was one of the best attended for many years.  This year the membership reached record levels as returning members of the 2nd AIF joined up.  The Sub-Branch supported many appeals for kindred patriotic bodies.  We congratulate Mr G.S. Hawker on being re-appointed as Country Vice-President of the League.  The Sub-Branch has been represented at all the Welcome Home Socials for the boys.  Last year I reported that a drive should be made to get new clubrooms.  A sub-committee was established and an appeal for funds launched.  I can report that we are just now waiting to finalise the purchase of the SAFU building for the Clubrooms.  The conversion of the premises will take a great deal of time and money.  The incorporation of the Sub-Branch is also being undertaken.
