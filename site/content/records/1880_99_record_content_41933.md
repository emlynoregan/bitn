Burra Town Council

Mr Packard has advised that getting an order for the sale of vacant allotments would not exceed £10 in costs.  It was estimated that over £150 would be available for public works.

The excavation in connection with the drain near the brewery had been finished and the soil used to form the road where requested by Mr Lockyer.

Cr Sampson moved that the Mining Association be written to and asked to dedicate a block of land on the south side of the cemetery 350’ by 100’ for extension of the same.  Carried.
