Mr G.T. Pattullo was given a farewell at the Hanson Institute with supper in the Methodist Hall.  He has been District Clerk for 9 years and now, with the Hanson DC about to merge with other Councils, he has won the position of District Clerk for the Freeling DC ahead of 80 applicants.  A presentation was made of a handsome clock. Mrs Pattullo was presented with a copper jardini√®re and also with a picture from the Ladies Guild.  Dancing continued to midnight.  Mr & Mrs Pattullo left for their new home on 22 October.
