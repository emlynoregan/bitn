‘The Boys’ Friend’ writes arguing that instead of monuments or stained glass windows a more useful thing would be a club room with two large billiard rooms and several parlours for games as a place returned men could gather without recourse to hotels and the alcohol that does them more harm.  It should be easy to raise £3,000 from the combined patriotic societies.
