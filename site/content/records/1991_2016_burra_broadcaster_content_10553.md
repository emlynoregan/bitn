Kooringa CoHousing

The project has received approval, but now it appears that following cuts by the new Federal Government the funding for the project is in doubt.  A decision will be made today at a meeting of SA Community Housing Authority.  Development work on designs and getting approvals will not be wasted as examples set are already being taken up by projects elsewhere in SA.
