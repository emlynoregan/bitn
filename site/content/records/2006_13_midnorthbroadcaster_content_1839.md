Letter.  Vincent Burke, Brewery Cottage, Burra, writes on its 10th anniversary, to congratulate those who have made the Burra Art Gallery such a success.  He expresses special thanks to Graham Kellock, whose support as Chairman of the Goyder Council*, when the Art Gallery building was acquired, was vital to the project.  Also commendations to the Burra Town Hall Committee for the restoration of the building.

[The Council that bought the building was the Burra Burra DC, of which Graham Kellock was Chairman.]
