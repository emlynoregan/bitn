Obituary.  T.W. Wilkinson died at his home, ‘Rockville’, Kooringa, on Thursday, aged 81.  He was born at Kriederichtown, New Brunswick, [perhaps Fredericton?]on 23 Aug. 1842 and came to SA with his parents when aged 13.  When the exodus to The Yorke Peninsula took place the family went to Kadina where they carried on a business as chemists.  Mr Wilkinson then spent 4 years in Gawler, before returning to Burra in 1872 and buying C. Dyer’s dispensary in Kooringa.  He carried on the business till 1911, when he retired and handed it over to his son, C.D. Wilkinson.  For over 40 years he was treasurer of the Burra Institute and was Mayor in 1890.

He was a long time member of the Burra Jubilee Benevolent Society and held many offices in the Wesleyan and then the Methodist Churches.  He married Miss E. Merritt of Kooringa, who died last November 23rd.  11 children survive: -

Mesdames T.H. Bell (Adelaide), J. Griffith (Northcote, Victoria), G.G. Hawkes (Koonoona), Misses Annie & Helen (Kooringa) & Miss Vera, (Unley) and Messrs Frank (Perth WA), Charles D. (Kooringa), Roland (River Murray), Robert (Qld), Douglas (Mt Barker). And a number of grandchildren.
