Porter’s Lagoon Boat Club.  The low rainfall of recent years has seen the lagoon fall so low that aquatic events are now impossible.  The club intends to improve facilities when opportunity offers.  Last year the floods of 27 December when over 4” fell made it possible to carry on when it had seemed impossible, but the drought of 1930 has undone all that and the rain since July, though good has been steady and produced no run-off.  The greatest depth is now only about 4’6” and from the edge it is only about 1’ for some distance over about 3’ of mud.  It is not yet as low as in 1917 when it was dry and many tons of salt were harvested for stock.  The club will protect its assets and has about £100 in hand.
