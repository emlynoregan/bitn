Burra Town Council, 13 July

There was considerable discussion concerning setting money aside to be used for the Centenary Year projects.  This would be subsidised by the Government and the Council could then employ the unemployed as it wished.  It was resolved to set aside Â£100 for 1936 and in the meantime to prepare the ground for planting trees as suggested in the discussion.  It was also resolved that a big proportion of the relief grant be set aside to raise metal [from the Mine and Hospital Quarries.]

Aberdeen Croquet Club has improved its area greatly as a result of work by Mr R. Fairchild.  When planted this area would have a fine appearance.  The Club was now interested in buying some adjacent blocks.  The Town Clerk will look up the names of owners for them.
