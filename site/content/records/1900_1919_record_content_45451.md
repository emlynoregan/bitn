Mr Winnall explained the lease of the creek to Hon. John Lewis.  It was for 99 years, giving the lessee right of way for stock from Kingston St Bridge to below the Mill for Â£3-15-0 p.a. or 5% interest on the money paid for the creek.  The portions needed were shown on a plan: the rest could be fenced and planted.

Cr Killicoat was against a lease, saying it ought to be open to all as a stock route.  The lessee could block the route to others.  Mr Winnall did not think Mr Lewis could block other users, but he could impound straying stock or stock at large on it.

Cr Radford was concerned as well, apparently along similar lines to Cr Killicoat.

Mr Winnall thought Mr Lewis would agree to the route being a right of way for all travelling stock.

Cr Killicoat said that no lease was needed; let the route be a proclaimed stock route for all time.

Mr Lewis will be asked if he would be satisfied with no lease, but it being proclaimed a public right of way and so registered on the deed.

Mr Winnall pointed out that Mr Lewis had given the Council the option of purchasing the creek on the condition he got the lease.

Dr Ashton submitted plans for a surgery and residence in Kooringa.  Approved.
