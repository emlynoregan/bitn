Kooringa News, 26 July

Obituary.  Last Sunday a young girl living at Redruth found the body of a man lying in an old level belonging to the Bon Accord Mine.  The body was identified as that of an old man named Arthur Quinn; an old colonist well known in the Burra.  A vein in an arm had been severed and a knife with blood on it lay nearby.  An inquest before Mr MacDermott returned a verdict of felo de se [i.e. suicide]. The deceased was a shoemaker of intemperate habits and it is thought that the failure to arrive of his usual remittance from Ireland and his intemperate habits led to this sad outcome.  [Arthur Quinn died 22 July 1860 at Aberdeen, residence Kooringa age estimated at 50.]
