Mt Bryan School

The official opening of the new building will take place on Saturday 21 February at 11 a.m. by Mr Graham Gunn MP for Eyre.  The surroundings have also been improved by extensive landscaping.

Hallett Primary School staff and students are also looking forward to using their new school building.  Stage 2 – the landscaping – has yet to be completed.

Booborowie School has recently been upgraded.
