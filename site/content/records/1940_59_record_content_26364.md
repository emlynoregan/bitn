Burra Kindergarten.  The formation of a kindergarten for pre-school children in Burra is well underway.  The committee met of Friday in the Town Hall and President Rev. M.P. Cowle presided.  The Defence Department has at last replied favourably to a request to use the Drill Hall.  Application will now be made to the Kindergarten Union for affiliation and the right to open a Play Centre.  A fully trained teacher will not be available until September, when the present course ends and in the meantime applications will be sought from a local person until a trained person can be obtained.
