[Note.  Some dirty tricks in the election campaign seem to have been employed to discredit William Killicoat.  A claim was circulated that he proposed to pay 5½ days wages for 6 days work when he was a District Councillor.  He answered this in an advertisement on 23 November.  Another claim was that he owed the Shearers’ Union £2-5-0 and had refused to pay.  This was refuted in the paper of 7 December with reference to receipts etc.]
