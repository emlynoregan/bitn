Burra Show Society

Annual Report of the President, M. Stockman.

Burra show was held on 9 October in ideal fine cool weather.	It was very successful with gate takings of £258 – a record for many years.  Immediate Past President Mr Rex Warnes, who is also President of the Royal Adelaide Show, opened our show.

Horses in action had a record 548 entries.  Mr Roy Jeffrey had the marathon job of judging this section.  We must consider having two rings going at once to reduce the time this year.

The number of entries in the sheep section continues to disappoint.
