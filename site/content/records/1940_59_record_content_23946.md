Burra Town Council

At a recent meeting the Mayor said a suggestion had been made that they erect a memorial in Market Square to the discoverer of copper, Pickett.  It would cost about £50 and could, he said, be financed by a Shilling Fund through the columns of the Burra Record.    It was resolved to proceed and that the Council kick it off with a £1 donation.

Cr Jennison said he would like to see the lights that festooned the Town Hall for the Centenary Celebrations permanently installed for use on special occasions.  The Clerk will make further enquiries of the Burra Electric Supply Co. concerning costs.

Civil Defence Headquarters wrote concerning firefighting equipment being issued to Councils, in all probability without cost.  It was decided to accept the offer.

Mr A.E. Smith advised that the Minister of the Army was now moving in the matter of the release of Sgt Davey.

It was decided to leave the ‘Welcome’ sign at the Post Office, from the centenary Celebrations, in position for some time as a mark of appreciation for returning servicemen and women.

Appreciation was expressed for all the men and women who had helped make the Centenary Celebrations so successful.
