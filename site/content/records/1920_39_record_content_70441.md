Swimming Pool

The paper continues its campaign with an article reporting the State Department of Public Health supporting swimming as an aid to good community and personal health.  A second article reports a Â£400 pool built at Wudinna 100ft x 30ft with an average depth of 4ft.  A third article reports the formation of a committee on Thursday night to approach the Council about a swimming pool.  A petition is being circulated.  Finally the committee has asked to meet the Council, which has agreed to receive them on 11 April.
