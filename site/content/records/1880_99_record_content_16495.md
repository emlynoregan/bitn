Burra School Board of Advice met on Wednesday.  Reports of children improperly supplied with drinking water were investigated and found to be wildly exaggerated, but there was a shortage of pannikins.  A supply has been arranged.

The 1884 quarterly returns showed 472 children on the register with an average attendance of 323.  There were 81 free scholars

At Copperhouse there were 45 enrolled with an average 30 attending and 4 free scholars.

Davieston had 27 enrolled, an average attendance of 16 and no free scholars.
