Russell Morrison – A Profile

Russell Morrison was born in Burra and works in many different mediums.  Landscapes in oils or watercolours make up the greater part, but he has also done portraits in oils, cast architectural sculptures and jewel-encrusted repoussé silverware.  His painting ‘Barmy Army Adelaide Oval Ball and Chain’ was shortlisted for the Sulman Prize and he has also had work submitted for the Archibald and Wynne Prizes this year.  A one-time engineering student, he has also been a construction worker, a sheep station hand, commercial artist, shearers’ cook and winery cellar hand.
