Aberdeen Tennis Club held a meeting on Friday and hotly debated the question of playing on Sundays.

There was a large majority in favour of Sunday play. Of thirty members present only six opposed Sunday play.  A move to defy the Council by a mass turnout on Sunday was deferred and a decision was taken to await the Council’s deliberations next Monday.

Those in favour of Sunday sport pointed out there was no agreement of a lease between the Club and the Council and therefore it was the prerogative of the Club to make the decision.  They also said there was no By-Law prohibiting play on parklands on Sundays and the Council therefore had no right to veto Sunday play.

Some officials have said that if the Club does not get its own way in this matter, it will shift its courts to another site – probably to the Syndicate’s Ground at Burra North.  Here there is already a sound foundation for grass courts, with backstops and a clubhouse.  At present the club has £150 in hand and contractors have been engaged to tear up a court and rebuild it.  Extensive alterations are also planned for the existing Clubhouse and kitchen.

Last night’s Council meeting decided to inform the Club that Council could find no agreement of lease containing a clause debarring the Club from playing tennis on Sundays and the Burra Town Council By-Laws do not contain a By-Law prohibiting Sunday Sport.
